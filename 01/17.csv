  the Siegert Formula",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When stimulated by a very large number of Poisson-like presynaptic current
input spikes, the temporal dynamics of the soma membrane potential $V(t)$ of a
leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron is typically modeled in the diffusion
limit and treated as a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (OUP). When the potential
reaches a threshold value $\theta$, $V(t) = \theta$, the LIF neuron fires and
the membrane potential is reset to a resting value, $V_0 < \theta$, and clamped
to this value for a specified (non-stochastic) absolute refractory period $T_r
\ge 0$, after which the cycle is repeated. The time between firings is given by
the random variable $T_f = T_r+ T$ where $T$ is the random time which elapses
between the ""unpinning"" of the membrane potential clamp and the next,
subsequent firing of the neuron. The mean time-to-fire, $\widehat{T}_f =
\text{E}(T_f) = T_r + \text{E}(T) = T_r + \widehat{T}$, provides a measure
$\rho$ of the average firing rate of the neuron, \[ \rho = \widehat{T}_f^{-1} =
\frac{1}{T_r + \widehat{T}} . \] This note briefly discusses some aspects of
the OUP model and derives the Siegert formula giving the firing rate, $\rho =
\rho(I_0)$ as a function of an injected current, $I_0$. This is a well-known
classical result and no claim to originality is made. The derivation of the
firing rate given in this report, which closely follows the derivation outlined
in the textbook by Gardiner, minimizes the required mathematical background and
is done in some pedagogic detail to facilitate study by graduate students and

condensation of a composite charged vector operator below a critical
temperature $T_c$, presumably describing $p+ip/p$-wave superconductors. In the
case of $p+ip$-wave superconductors the transitions are always of second order.
But for $p$-wave superconductors we determine the existence of a critical value
$\alpha_c$ of the gravitational coupling (for fixed Higgs v.e.v. parameter
$\hat m_W$) beyond which the transitions become of first order. As a
by-product, we show that the $p$-wave phase is energetically favored over the

domain wall geometries that interpolate between $AdS_4$ spaces with different

gravitational coupling near the critical coupling suggests the presence of
second order quantum phase transitions. We finally study the dependence of the

breathers modes. I numerically study the continuous sine-Gordon model,

which a finite part of the spectrum consists of arbitrarily prescribed
eigenvalues of arbitrary (finite) multiplicity. The only constraints one has to
respect are the exception of the zero eigenvalue (due to the Atiyah-Singer
index theorem) and in certain dimensions, the quaternionic structure of the
eigenspaces and also the symmetry of the spectrum. Dahl also proved his
conjecture in case all eigenvalues have simple multiplicities. The question, if
one can prescribe arbitrary multiplicities, or if the existence of eigenvalues
of higher multiplicity might somehow be topologically obstructed, has been open

As expected, the response speed of InSe/graphene photodetectors is down to 120
{\mu}s, which is about 40 times faster than that of our InSe/metal device. And
it can also be tuned by the back-gate voltage from 310 {\mu}s down to 100

AW-1 simultaneously. Meanwhile the InSe/graphene photodetectors possess a broad

  to Power System Operations",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Power systems are undergoing unprecedented transformations with the
incorporation of larger amounts of renewable energy sources, distributed
generation and demand response. All these changes, while potentially making
power grids more responsive, efficient and resilient, also pose significant
implementation challenges. In particular, operating the new power grid will
require new tools and algorithms capable of predicting if the current state of
the system is operationally safe. In this paper we study and generalize the
so-called energy function as a tool to design algorithms to test if a
high-voltage power transmission system is within the allowed operational
limits. In the past the energy function technique was utilized primarily to
access the power system transient stability. In this manuscript, we take a new
look at energy functions and focus on an aspect that has previously received
little attention: Convexity. We characterize the domain of voltage magnitudes
and phases within which the energy function is convex. We show that the domain
of the energy function convexity is sufficiently large to include most
operationally relevant and practically interesting cases. We show how the
energy function convexity can be used to analyze power flow equations, e.g. to
certify solution uniqueness or non-existence within the domain of convexity.
This and other useful features of the generalized energy function are described
and illustrated on IEEE 14 and 118 bus models.

self-propelled dumbbells with only repulsive interactions. This model undergoes
a phase transition between a homogeneous and a segregated phase and we focus on
the former. We analyse the translational and rotational mean square
displacements in terms of the P\'eclet number, describing the relative role of
active forces and thermal fluctuations, and of particle density. We find that
the four distinct regimes of the translational mean square displacement of the
single active dumbbell survive at finite density for parameters that lead to a
separation of time-scales. We establish the P\'eclet number and density
dependence of the diffusion constant in the last diffusive regime. We prove
that the ratio between the diffusion constant and its value for the single
dumbbell depends on temperature and active force only through the P\'eclet
number at all densities explored. We also study the rotational mean square
displacement proving the existence of a rich behavior with intermediate regimes
only appearing at finite density. The ratio of the rotational late-time
diffusion constant and its vanishing density limit depends on the P\'eclet
number and density only. At low P\'eclet number it is a monotonically
decreasing function of density. At high P\'eclet number it first increases to
reach a maximum and next decreases as a function of density. We interpret the
latter result advocating the presence of large-scale fluctuations close to the
transition, at large enough density, that favour coherent rotation inhibiting,
however, rotational motion for even larger packing fractions.

quasi-particle excitations in condensed matter physics. The work presented in
this thesis is focused on two different families of novel materials, namely the
iron-based superconductors (FeBS), multiferroic oxides and double perovskite.
Although the properties of these two systems are quite different, some
comparison can still be drawn between them. For instance, in both of these
systems magnetism plays a crucial role and intricate coupling between phononic,
magnetic and orbital degrees of freedom is crucial to understand their
underlying physics responsible for their various exotic physical properties.
Understanding the microscopic origin of quasi-particle excitations, such as
phonons, magnons, orbitons, plasmons etc., and coupling between them in these
complex materials, has been an intense field of research because it is believed
that these excitations hold the key for explaining their rich physics. The

measured flat laminations onto the space of measured hyperbolic laminations,
for any arbitrary half-translation structure and hyperbolic metric on a

paper, we consider the benefit of multipoint connectivity in allowing User
Equipment (UEs) to split their transmit power over simultaneous links to the BS
and the relay, in effect transmitting two parallel flows. We model decisions by
the UEs as to: (i) which point of access to attach to (either a relay or a
relay and the BS or only the BS); and (ii) how to allocate transmit power over
these links so as to maximize their total rate. We show that this flexibility
in the selection of points of access leads to substantial network capacity
increase against when nodes operate in a fixed network topology. Individual
adaptations by UEs, in terms of both point of access and transmit power, are
interdependent due to interference and to the possibility of over-loading of
the backhaul links. We show that these decisions can converge without any
explicit cooperation and derive a closed-form expression for the transmit power
levels.

through parallel and distributed computing, this research quantized the density
classification problem and adopted the Quantum Particle Automata (QPA) to solve
the quantized problem. In order to solve this problem, the QPA needed a unitary
operator to carry out the QPA evolution and a boundary partition to make the
classification decisions. We designed a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search for
the unitary operators and the boundary partitions to classify the density of
binary inputs with length 5. The GA was able to find more than one unitary
operator that can transform the QPA in ways such that when the particle was
measured, it was more likely to collapse to the basis states that were on the
correct side of the boundary partition for the QPA to decide if the binary
input had majority density 0 or majority density 1. We analyzed these solutions
and found that the QPA evolution dynamic was driven by a particular parameter
$\theta$ of the unitary operator: a small $\theta$ gave the particle small mass
hence fast evolution while large $\theta$ had the opposite effect. While these
results are encouraging, scaling these solutions for binary inputs of arbitrary
length of $n$ requires additional analysis, which we will investigate in our
future work.

of a wide variety of machine learning models. The success of machine learning
has led practitioners in diverse real-world settings to learn classifiers for
practical problems. As machine learning becomes commonplace, Bayesian
optimization becomes an attractive method for practitioners to automate the
process of classifier hyper-parameter tuning. A key observation is that the
data used for tuning models in these settings is often sensitive. Certain data
such as genetic predisposition, personal email statistics, and car accident
history, if not properly private, may be at risk of being inferred from
Bayesian optimization outputs. To address this, we introduce methods for
releasing the best hyper-parameters and classifier accuracy privately.
Leveraging the strong theoretical guarantees of differential privacy and known
Bayesian optimization convergence bounds, we prove that under a GP assumption
these private quantities are also near-optimal. Finally, even if this
assumption is not satisfied, we can use different smoothness guarantees to
protect privacy.

studied intensively in the recent years by using atomistic simulation tools
owing to its importance in determining the effective thermal conductivity of
nanostructured materials. Atomistic Green's function (AGF) method with
interatomic force constants from the first-principles (FP) calculations has
evolved to be a promising approach to study phonon transmission in many not
well-studied material systems. However, the direct FP calculation for
interatomic force constants becomes infeasible when the system involves atomic
disorder. Mass approximation is usually used, but its validity has not been
tested. In this paper, we employ the higher-order force constant model to
extract harmonic force constants from the FP calculations, which originates
from the virtual crystal approximation but considers the local force-field
difference. As a feasibility demonstration of the proposed method that
integrates higher-order force constant model from the FP calculations with the
AGF, we study the phonon transmission in the Mg2Si/Mg2Si1-xSnx systems. When
integrated with the AGF, the widely-used mass approximation is found to
overpredict phonon transmission across Mg2Si/Mg2Sn interface. The difference
can be attributed to the absence of local strain field-induced scattering in
the mass approximation, which makes the high-frequency phonons less scattered.
The frequency-dependent phonon transmission across an interface between a
crystal and an alloy, which often appears in high efficiency ""nanoparticle in
alloy"" thermoelectric materials, is studied. The interfacial thermal resistance
across Mg2Si/Mg2Si1-xSnx interface is found to be weakly dependent on the
composition of Sn when the composition x is less than 40%, but increases
rapidly when it is larger than 40% due to the transition of high-frequency
phonon DOS in Mg2Si1-xSnx alloys.

previously for the spread of political revolutions [1], which is shown to be
mathematically consistent with the proposed ABM and provides a way to analyze
the global behaviour of the ABM. This consistency with the linear threshold ABM
also provides further justification a posteriori for the compartmental model of
[1]. Extending concepts from epidemiological modelling, we define a basic
reproduction number $R_0$ for the linear threshold ABM and apply it to predict
ABM behaviour on empirical networks. In small-scale numerical tests we
investigate experimentally the differences in spreading behaviour that occur
under the linear threshold ABM model when applied to some empirical online and

analysis for heap reasoning with (2) an interpolation-based technique for
refining heap-shape invariants with data invariants. Splinter is property
directed, precise, and produces counterexample traces when a property does not
hold. Using the novel notion of spatial interpolants modulo theories, Splinter
can infer complex invariants over general recursive predicates, e.g., of the
form all elements in a linked list are even or a binary tree is sorted.
Furthermore, we treat interpolation as a black box, which gives us the freedom
to encode data manipulation in any suitable theory for a given program (e.g.,
bit vectors, arrays, or linear arithmetic), so that our technique immediately
benefits from any future advances in SMT solving and interpolation.

process in formation and evolution of stars and disks. Because the ionization
degree in star forming clouds is extremely low, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) effects such as ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation work strongly
during protostellar collapse. These effects have significant impacts in the
early phase of star formation as they redistribute magnetic flux and suppress
angular momentum transport by magnetic fields. We perform three-dimensional
nested-grid radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations including Ohmic
dissipation and ambipolar diffusion. Without these effects, magnetic fields
transport angular momentum so efficiently that no rotationally supported disk
is formed even after the second collapse. Ohmic dissipation works only in a
relatively high density region within the first core and suppresses angular
momentum transport, enabling formation of a very small rotationally supported
disk after the second collapse. With both Ohmic dissipation and ambipolar
diffusion, these effects work effectively in almost the entire region within
the first core and significant magnetic flux loss occurs. As a result, a
rotationally supported disk is formed even before a protostellar core forms.
The size of the disk is still small, about 5 AU at the end of the first core
phase, but this disk will grow later as gas accretion continues. Thus the
non-ideal MHD effects can resolve the so-called magnetic braking catastrophe
while maintaining the disk size small in the early phase, which is implied from
recent interferometric observations.

underlying dark matter structure. We find that SMGs exhibit a relatively
complex bias: some regions of high SMG overdensity are underdense in terms of
dark matter mass, and some regions of high dark matter overdensity contain no
SMGs. Because of their rarity, Poisson noise causes scatter in the SMG
overdensity at fixed dark matter overdensity. Consequently, rich associations
of less-luminous, more-abundant galaxies (i.e. Lyman-break galaxy analogues)
trace the highest dark matter overdensities much better than SMGs. Even on
average, SMG associations are relatively poor tracers of the most significant
dark matter overdensities because of 'downsizing': at z < ~2.5, the
most-massive galaxies that reside in the highest dark matter overdensities have
already had their star formation quenched and are thus no longer SMGs. At a

addressed using periodic calculations. The binding energy of Li or Cl adsorbed

The trends in the binding energy as a function of adsorbent remain the same for
both the periodic and molecular cases. The band gap or HOMO-LUMO gap and charge
transfer are analysed. In addition, for the bulk or bilayer, different kinds of
stacking have been considered. It is found that the parallel bulk or bilayer

coherent state by controlling the phase of an applied field. Plasmas support
coherent wave structures that can be generated by intense laser fields. Here,
we demonstrate the coherent control of plasma dynamics in a laser wakefield
electron acceleration experiment. A genetic algorithm is implemented using a
deformable mirror with the electron beam signal as feedback, which allows a
heuristic search for the optimal wavefront under laser-plasma conditions that
is not known a priori. We are able to improve both the electron beam charge and
angular distribution by an order of magnitude. These improvements do not simply
correlate with having the `best' focal spot, since the highest quality vacuum
focal spot produces a greatly inferior electron beam, but instead correspond to
the particular laser phase that steers the plasma wave to a final state with
optimal accelerating fields.

selected from Spitzer Space Telescope imaging surveys. Selection in the

compare the luminosity functions of the obscured and unobscured AGN in a more

AGN luminosity function can be well described by a broken power-law model in
which the break luminosity decreases with redshift. At high redshifts
($z>1.6$), we find significantly more AGN at a given bolometric luminosity than
found by either optical quasar surveys or hard X-ray surveys. The fraction of
obscured AGN decreases rapidly with increasing AGN luminosity, but, at least at
high redshifts, appears to remain at $\approx 50$\% even at bolometric
luminosities $\sim 10^{14}L_{\odot}$. The data support a picture in which the
obscured and unobscured populations evolve differently, with some evidence that
high luminosity obscured quasars peak in space density at a higher redshift
than their unobscured counterparts. The amount of accretion energy in the
Universe estimated from this work suggests that AGN contribute about 12\% to
the total radiation intensity of the Universe, and a high radiative accretion
efficiency $\approx 0.18^{+0.12}_{-0.07}$ is required to match current
estimates of the local mass density in black holes.

two-dimensional periodic substrate using simulations of a particle-based
skyrmion model, focusing on the role of the non-dissipative Magnus term. In the
overdamped limit, the skyrmion depins into a sliding state with a Hall angle of
zero. When a Magnus term is included, the Hall angle is nonzero in the absence
of a substrate. On a periodic substrate, the Hall angle varies with the drive
amplitude. Due to the substrate symmetry the Hall angle does not change
continuously with drive, but forms a series of discrete steps at rational
ratios of the skyrmion velocity components perpendicular and parallel to the
drive direction, when the skyrmion motion locks to symmetry directions of the
substrate for fixed intervals of the drive amplitude. On each step, the Hall
angle is constant and the skyrmion motion is orderly. Transitions between
locked phases generate pronounced cusps in the velocity-force curves, as well
as regions of negative differential mobility. The number of observable locking
steps increases when the relative strength of the Magnus term increases. We
find an overshoot phenomena where the Hall angle exceeds the clean limit value,
as well as an acceleration effect where the skyrmion moves faster over a
substrate than through a clean sample. These effects are robust for different
types of periodic substrates. With a simple model for a skyrmion interacting
with a single pin, we can capture the behavior of the Hall angle. The Magnus
term induces a curvature in the skrymion orbit as it moves through the pin,
resulting in a side step phenomenon that decreases with increasing drive. When
the Magnus term is large, the range of impact parameters that permit the
skyrmion to be trapped by the pin is small, which is a reasons that strong
Magnus force effects reduce the pinning in skyrmion systems.

However,
most existing sequence mapping algorithms are insufficiently general.
  Results: We introduce context schemes: a method that allows the unambiguous
recognition of a reference base in a query sequence by testing the query for
substrings from an algorithmically defined set. Context schemes only map when
there is a unique best mapping, and define this criterion uniformly for all
reference bases. Mappings under context schemes can also be made stable, so
that extension of the query string (e.g. by increasing read length) will not
alter the mapping of previously mapped positions. Context schemes are general
in several senses. They natively support the detection of arbitrary complex,
novel rearrangements relative to the reference. They can scale over orders of
magnitude in query sequence length. Finally, they are trivially extensible to
more complex reference structures, such as graphs, that incorporate additional
variation. We demonstrate empirically the existence of high performance context
schemes, and present efficient context scheme mapping algorithms.

height of zero. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to apply a local
force, the graphene sheet will reversibly rise and fall in height until the
height reaches 60-70 percent of its maximum at which point a sudden, permanent
jump occurs. We successfully model the ripples as a spin-half Ising magnetic
system, where the height of the graphene is the spin. The permanent jump in
height, controlled by the tunneling current, is found to be equivalent to an
antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition. The thermal load
underneath the STM tip alters the local tension and is identified as the
responsible mechanism for the phase transition. Four universal critical

show how the properties of present-day galaxies in cosmological

feedback. Massive galaxies become redder, older, less massive, less compact,
and show greater $\alpha$ enhancement than their counterparts without AGN.
Since we reproduce the black hole mass and galaxy mass relation, smaller
galaxies do not host a supermassive black hole and their star formation history
is affected very little, but they can get external enrichment from nearby AGN

negligible, and the mass--metallicity relations, which are mainly generated by

gauge theory over the density matrices based on their pure-state representation
in a larger Hilbert space has been reported. However, since the uniquely
defined square root $\sqrt{\rho}$ of a density matrix $\rho$ provides a global
gauge, this construction is always topologically trivial. Here, we study a more
restrictive gauge structure which can be topologically non-trivial and is
capable of resolving homotopically distinct mappings of density matrices
subject to various spectral constraints. Remarkably, in this framework,
topological invariants can be directly defined and calculated for mixed states.
In the limit of pure states, the well known system of topological invariants
for gapped band structures at zero temperature is reproduced. We compare our

the time of encoding process is considerably reduced. The algorithm exploits a
domain pool reduction approach, along with using innovative predefined values

Within this approach only domain blocks with entropies greater than a threshold

encoding process, the domain block with small enough distance shall be found
only for the range blocks with low activity (equivalently low entropy). This
novel point is used to find reasonable estimations of S, and use them in the

Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI), resolving the N' band (9.81 - 12.41
um) emission around the nearby main-sequence star eta Crv (F2V, 1-2 Gyr). The
measured source null depth amounts to 4.40% +/- 0.35% over a field-of-view of
140 mas in radius (~2.6\,AU at the distance of eta Corvi) and shows no
significant variation over 35{\deg} of sky rotation. This relatively low null
is unexpected given the total disk to star flux ratio measured by Spitzer/IRS
(~23% across the N' band), suggesting that a significant fraction of the dust
lies within the central nulled response of the LBTI (79 mas or 1.4 AU).
Modeling of the warm disk shows that it cannot resemble a scaled version of the
Solar zodiacal cloud, unless it is almost perpendicular to the outer disk
imaged by Herschel. It is more likely that the inner and outer disks are
coplanar and the warm dust is located at a distance of 0.5-1.0 AU,
significantly closer than previously predicted by models of the IRS spectrum
(~3 AU). The predicted disk sizes can be reconciled if the warm disk is not
centrosymmetric, or if the dust particles are dominated by very small grains.
Both possibilities hint that a recent collision has produced much of the dust.
Finally, we discuss the implications for the presence of dust at the distance
where the insolation is the same as Earth's (2.3 AU).

We concentrate on single-particle and pairing properties as potential sources

back to the differences in the underlying single-particle structure of the
various covariant energy density functionals (CEDF). It is found that the
uncertainties in the description of single-particle energies at the two-neutron
drip line are dominated by those existing already in known nuclei. Only
approximately one third of these uncertainties are due to the uncertainties in
the isovector channel of CEDF's. Thus, improving the CEDF description of
single-particle energies in known nuclei will also reduce the uncertainties in
the prediction of the position of two-neutron drip line. The predictions of
pairing properties in neutron rich nuclei depend on the CEDF. Although pairing
properties affect moderately the position of the two-neutron drip line they
represent only a secondary source for the uncertainties in the definition of
the position of the two-neutron drip line.

filter-based fault detection over these groups, we obtain binary detection
outcomes, which can then be used to recover the fault state of all sensors. We
first present this method using combinatorial group testing. We then present a
novel adaptive group testing method based on Bayesian inference. This adaptive
method further reduces the number of required tests and is suitable for noisy
group test systems. Compared to non-group testing methods, our algorithm
achieves similar detection accuracy with fewer tests and thus lower
computational complexity. Compared to other adaptive group testing methods, the
proposed method achieves higher accuracy when test results are noisy. We
perform extensive numerical analysis using a set of real vibration data

network mounted on the bridge. We also discuss how the features of the Kalman

for a long time. This situation was changed in 1995, when a new superfluid was
born with the realization of the Bose-Einstein condensation in ultracold atomic
gases. The liquid helium 4 is strongly interacting and has no spin; there is
almost no way to change its parameters, such as interaction strength and
density. The new superfluid, Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), offers various
aspects of advantages over liquid helium. On the one hand, BEC is weakly
interacting and has spin degrees of freedom. On the other hand, it is
convenient to tune almost all the parameters of a BEC, for example, the kinetic
energy by spin-orbit coupling, the density by the external potential, and the
interaction by Feshbach resonance. Great efforts have been devoted to studying
these new aspects of superfluidity, and the results have greatly enriched our
understanding of superfluidity. Here we review these developments by focusing
on the stability and critical velocity of various superfluids. The BEC systems
considered include a uniform superfluid in free space, a superfluid with its
density periodically modulated, a superfluid with artificially engineered
spin-orbit coupling, and a superfluid of pure spin current. Due to the weak
interaction, these BEC systems can be well described by the mean field
Gross-Pitaevskii theory and their superfluidity, in particular critical
velocities, can be examined with Landau's theory of superfluid. Experimental
proposals to observe these new aspects of superfluidity are discussed.

the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, and pseudogaps have been
observed in many systems. However, since the discovery of the high temperature
superconductors (HTSC) in 1986, the central role attributed to the pseudogap in
these systems has meant that by many researchers now associate the term
pseudogap exclusively with the HTSC phenomenon. Recently, the problem has got a
lot of new attention with the rediscovery of two distinct energy scales
(`two-gap scenario') and charge density waves patterns in the cuprates. Despite
many excellent reviews on the pseudogap phenomenon in HTSC, published from its
very discovery up to now, the mechanism of the pseudogap and its relation to
superconductivity are still open questions. The present review represents a
contribution dealing with the pseudogap, focusing on results from angle
resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and ends up with the conclusion
that the pseudogap in cuprates is a complex phenomenon which includes at least
three different `intertwined' orders: spin and charge density waves and
preformed pairs, which appears in different parts of the phase diagram. The
density waves in cuprates are competing to superconductivity for the electronic
states but, on the other hand, should drive the electronic structure to
vicinity of Lifshitz transition, that could be a key similarity between the
superconducting cuprates and iron based superconductors. One may also note that
since the pseudogap in cuprates has multiple origins there is no need to recoin
the term suggested by Mott.

be dominated by a random noise at a depth of only a few Mm. It was proposed
that the ensemble averaging might be a solution to learn about the structure of
the convective flows, e.g., about the depth structure of supergranulation.
Methods. Time--distance inversion is applied to the statistical sample of
~$10^4$ supergranules, which allows to regularise weakly about the random-noise
term of the inversion cost function and hence to have a much better
localisation in space. We compare these inversions at four depths (1.9, 2.9,
4.3, and 6.2 Mm) when using different spatio-temporal filtering schemes in
order to gain confidence about these inferences. Results. The flows inferred by
using different spatio-temporal filtering schemes are different (even by the
sign) even-though the formal averaging kernels and the random-noise levels are
very similar. The inverted flows alterates its sign several times with depth.
It is suggested that this is due to the inaccuracies in the forward problem
that are possibly amplified by the inversion. It is possible that also other
time--distance inversions are affected by this issue.

yet challenging task, not only because of the presence of speckle, but also due
to the variations of surface backscattering properties in the images.
Tremendous investigations have been made to eliminate the speckle effects for
the segmentation of SAR images, while few work devotes to dealing with the
variations of backscattering coefficients in the images. In order to overcome
both the two difficulties, this paper presents a novel SAR image segmentation
method by exploiting a multi-scale active contour model based on the non-local
processing principle. More precisely, we first formulize the SAR segmentation
problem with an active contour model by integrating the non-local interactions
between pairs of patches inside and outside the segmented regions. Secondly, a
multi-scale strategy is proposed to speed up the non-local active contour
segmentation procedure and to avoid falling into local minimum for achieving
more accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on simulated and real
SAR images demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method:
it can not only achieve precise segmentations for images with heavy speckles
and non-local intensity variations, but also can be used for SAR images from
different types of sensors.

explaining the spectral energy distribution and spectral variability of these

proposed as the mechanism of bulk acceleration of relativistic outflows. This

MeV-peak energies serving as target of accelerated protons. In this work we
describe the ""orphan"" TeV flares presented in blazars 1ES 1959+650 and Mrk421

performance-enhanced image encryption schemes based on depth-conversion
integral imaging and chaotic maps, aiming to meet the requirements of secure
image transmission. First, the input image is decomposed into an elemental
image array (EIA) by utilizing a pinhole array. Then, the obtained image are
encrypted by combining the use of cellular automata and chaotic logistic maps.
In the image reconstruction process, the conventional computational integral
imaging reconstruction (CIIR) technique is a pixel-superposition technique; the
resolution of the reconstructed image is dramatically degraded due to the large
magnification in the superposition process as the pickup distance increases.
The smart mapping technique is introduced to improve the problem of CIIR. A
novel property of the proposed scheme is its depth-conversion ability, which
converts original elemental images recorded at long distance to ones recorded
near the pinhole array and consequently reduce the magnification factor. The
results of numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and security of
this proposed scheme.

extension to the Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality. Taking the symmetry effect into

parameters. We demonstrate the power of this approach by applying it to one

equation which describes the behaviour of small-amplitude solutions for a
nonlinear PDE in finite volume, provided that the linear part of the equation

equation is obtained by retaining only the resonant terms of the nonlinearity
(which may be hamiltonian, or may be not); the assertion that it describes the
limiting behaviour of small-amplitude solutions is a rigorous mathematical
theorem. In particular, the method applies to the three-- and four--wave
systems. We demonstrate that different possible types of energy transport are
covered by this method, depending on whether the set of resonances splits into
finite clusters (this happens, e.g. in case of the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima
equation), or is connected (this happens, e.g. in the case of the NLS equation
if the space-dimension is at least two). For equations of the first type the
energy transition to high frequencies does not hold, while for equations of the
second type it may take place. In the case of the NLS equation we use next some
heuristic approximation from the arsenal of wave turbulence to show that under
the iterated limit ""the volume goes to infinity"", taken after the limit ""the
amplitude of oscillations goes to zero"", the energy spectrum of solutions for
the effective equation is described by a Zakharov-type kinetic equation.
Evoking the Zakharov ansatz we show that stationary in time and homogeneous in

Bohmian approach agrees with the consistent histories approach by Craig and
Singh for single-time histories, unlike the one studied earlier by Pinto-Neto

transitive action with finite kernel. This theorem uniformly generalizes many
previously known results and allows us to answer a question of Garion and
Glassner on the existence of highly transitive faithful actions of mapping
class groups. It also implies that in various geometric and algebraic settings,
the transitivity degree of an infinite group can only take two values, namely
$1$ and $\infty$. Here by transitivity degree of a group we mean the supremum
of transitivity degrees of its faithful permutation representations. Further,
for any countable group $G$ admitting a highly transitive faithful action, we
prove the following dichotomy: Either $G$ contains a normal subgroup isomorphic
to the infinite alternating group or $G$ resembles a free product from the
model theoretic point of view. We apply this theorem to obtain new results
about universal theory and mixed identities of acylindrically hyperbolic
groups. Finally, we discuss some open problems.

  Subjects and Intruders, Transparency to Users","27 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.DB cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are currently two approaches to anonymization: ""utility first"" (use an
anonymization method with suitable utility features, then empirically evaluate
the disclosure risk and, if necessary, reduce the risk by possibly sacrificing
some utility) or ""privacy first"" (enforce a target privacy level via a privacy
model, e.g., k-anonymity or epsilon-differential privacy, without regard to
utility). To get formal privacy guarantees, the second approach must be
followed, but then data releases with no utility guarantees are obtained. Also,
in general it is unclear how verifiable is anonymization by the data subject
(how safely released is the record she has contributed?), what type of intruder
is being considered (what does he know and want?) and how transparent is
anonymization towards the data user (what is the user told about methods and
parameters used?).
  We show that, using a generally applicable reverse mapping transformation,
any anonymization for microdata can be viewed as a permutation plus (perhaps) a
small amount of noise; permutation is thus shown to be the essential principle
underlying any anonymization of microdata, which allows giving simple utility
and privacy metrics. From this permutation paradigm, a new privacy model
naturally follows, which we call (d,v)-permuted privacy. The privacy ensured by
this method can be verified by each subject contributing an original record
(subject-verifiability) and also at the data set level by the data protector.
We then proceed to define a maximum-knowledge intruder model, which we argue
should be the one considered in anonymization. Finally, we make the case for
anonymization transparent to the data user, that is, compliant with Kerckhoff's
assumption (only the randomness used, if any, must stay secret).

of a programmable turbo decoder as an applicationspecific instruction-set

architecture is designed in such manner that it can be programmed to support
other receiver algorithms, for example, decoding based on the Viterbi
algorithm. Different suboptimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithms are used
and compared to one another for the softinput soft-output (SISO) component
decoders in a single TTA processor. The max-log-MAP algorithm outperforms the
other suboptimal algorithms in terms of latency. The design enables the
designer to change the suboptimal algorithms according to the bit error rate
(BER) performance requirement. Unlike many other programmable turbo decoder
implementations, quadratic polynomial permutation (QPP) interleaver is used in
this work for contention-free memory access and to make the processor 3GPP LTE

studied standard type A, B or C Bright Rimmed Clouds (BRCs), many other types

Reionization as possible with SKA-Low. We show why tomography is essential for
studying CD/EoR and present the scales which can be imaged at different
frequencies for the different phases of SKA- Low. Next we discuss the different
ways in which tomographic data can be analyzed. We end with an overview of
science questions which can only be answered by tomography, ranging from the
characterization of individual objects to understanding the global processes
shaping the Universe during the CD/EoR

Interference Broadcast Channel (IBC) with 2 cells and 2 users per cell are
investigated when only delayed channel state information is available at the
transmitter side (delayed CSIT). Retrospective Interference Alignment has shown
the benefits in terms of DoF of exploiting delayed CSIT for interference,
broadcast and also for the IBC. However, previous works studying the IBC with
delayed CSIT do not exploit the fact that the users of each cell are served by
a common transmitter. This work presents a four-phase precoding strategy taking
this into consideration. Assuming that transmitters and receivers are equipped
with $M,N$ antennas, respectively, new DoF inner bounds are proposed,
outperforming the existing ones for $\rho = \frac{M}{N} > 2.6413$.

$\delta(\phi)$ measures the geometric complexity of the iterates of $\phi$, and
the arithmetic degree $\alpha(\phi,x)$ measures the arithmetic complexity of
the forward $\phi$-orbit of $x$. It is known that
$\alpha(\phi,x)\le\delta(\phi)$, and it is conjectured that if the $\phi$-orbit
of $x$ is Zariski dense in $X$, then $\alpha(\phi,x)=\delta(\phi)$, i.e.,
arithmetic complexity equals geometric complexity. In this note we prove this
conjecture in the case that $X$ is an abelian variety, extending earlier work
in which the conjecture was proven for isogenies.

  public computing infrastructures",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Earth Observation (EO) mining aims at supporting efficient access and
exploration of petabyte-scale space- and airborne remote sensing archives that
are currently expanding at rates of terabytes per day. A significant challenge
is performing the analysis required by envisaged applications --- like for
instance process mapping for environmental risk management --- in reasonable
time. In this work, we address the problem of content-based image retrieval via
example-based queries from EO data archives. In particular, we focus on the
analysis of polarimetric SAR data, for which target decomposition theorems have
proved fundamental in discovering patterns in data and characterize the ground
scattering properties. To this end, we propose an interactive region-oriented
content-based image mining system in which 1) unsupervised ingestion processes
are distributed onto virtual machines in elastic, on-demand computing
infrastructures 2) archive-scale content hierarchical indexing is implemented
in terms of a ""big data"" analytics cluster-computing framework 3) query
processing amounts to traversing the generated binary tree index, computing
distances that correspond to descriptor-based similarity measures between image
groups and a query image tile. We describe in depth both the strategies and the
actual implementations for the ingestion and indexing components, and verify
the approach by experiments carried out on the NASA/JPL UAVSAR full
polarimetric data archive. We report the results of the tests performed on
computer clusters by using a public Infrastructure-as-a-Service and evaluating
the impact of cluster configuration on system performance. Results are
promising for data mapping and information retrieval applications.

quantitatively modify the self-affine scaling properties from anisotropic (at
