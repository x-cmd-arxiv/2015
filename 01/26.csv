larger eight dimensional space endowed with a hypercomplex structure. The

gravitational field equations which include matter. We also study the dynamical
effects of the second Ricci-type tensor when added to the Lagrangian density. A
simple Lagrangian density constructed from combination of the standard Ricci
tensor and a new tensor field that appears due to the immersion, leads to
gravitational equations in which the vacuum energy gravitates with a different
cosmological strength as in Phys. Rev. D {\bf 90}, 064017 (2014), rather than
with Newton's constant. As a result, the tiny observed curvature is reproduced
due to large hierarchies rather than fine-tuning.

modulation of two control parameters using the full counting statistics with

our approach and the real-time diagrammatic approach. An adiabatic modulation
of the control parameters induces the Berry-Sinitsyn-Nemenman (BSN) phase. We
show that the origin of the BSN phase is a non-adiabatic effect. The
adiabatically pumped charge (spin) is given by a summation of (i) a time
integral of the instantaneous steady charge (spin) current and (ii) a geometric
surface integral of the BSN curvature, which results from the BSN phase. In
quantum dots (QDs) weakly coupled to two leads, we show that (i) is usually
dominant if the thermodynamic parameters are modulated although it is zero if
the thermodynamic parameters are fixed to zero-bias. To observe the spin
effects, we consider collinear magnetic fields, which relate to spins through
the Zeeman effect, with different amplitudes applying to the QDs and the leads.
For interacting one level QD, we calculate analytically the pumped charge and
spin by modulating the magnetic fields and the coupling strengths to the leads
in the weak and strong interacting limits. We show that the difference between
these two limits appears through the averages of the numbers of the electron
with up and down spin in the QD. For the quantum pump by the modulation of the
magnetic fields of the QD and one lead, the energy-dependences of linewidth
functions, which are usually neglected, are essential.

constructed flexible cross-polytopes are non-constant during the flexion. Hence
these cross-polytopes give counterexamples to the Bellows Conjecture for
spherical polyhedra. Earlier a counterexample to this conjecture was built only
in dimension 3 (Alexandrov, 1997), and was not embedded. For flexible polyhedra
in spheres we suggest a weakening of the Bellows Conjecture, which we call the
Modified Bellows Conjecture. We show that this conjecture holds for all
flexible cross-polytopes of the simplest type among which there are our
counterexamples to the usual Bellows Conjecture. By the way, we obtain several
geometric results on flexible cross-polytopes of the simplest type. In

Electron transport is assumed to be supported by well oriented $p_z$ type

tight binding interpretation, the SOC opens up an effective $\pi_z-\pi_z$
coupling via interbase $p_{x,y}-p_z$ hopping, introducing spin coupled
transport. The resulting continuum model spectrum shows two Kramers doublet
transport channels with a gap proportional to the SOC. Each doubly degenerate

transport direction and thus selects for spin orientation. The model predicts
which spin orientation is selected depending on chirality and bias, changes in
spin preference as a function of input Fermi level and scattering suppression

has attracted increasing interest. A subjective visual property is useful
either on its own (e.g. image and video interestingness) or as an intermediate
representation for visual recognition (e.g. a relative attribute). Due to its
ambiguous nature, annotating the value of a subjective visual property for
learning a prediction model is challenging. To make the annotation more
reliable, recent studies employ crowdsourcing tools to collect pairwise
comparison labels because human annotators are much better at ranking two
images/videos (e.g. which one is more interesting) than giving an absolute
value to each of them separately. However, using crowdsourced data also
introduces outliers. Existing methods rely on majority voting to prune the
annotation outliers/errors. They thus require large amount of pairwise labels
to be collected. More importantly as a local outlier detection method, majority
voting is ineffective in identifying outliers that can cause global ranking
inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose a more principled way to identify
annotation outliers by formulating the subjective visual property prediction
task as a unified robust learning to rank problem, tackling both the outlier
detection and learning to rank jointly. Differing from existing methods, the
proposed method integrates local pairwise comparison labels together to
minimise a cost that corresponds to global inconsistency of ranking order. This
not only leads to better detection of annotation outliers but also enables
learning with extremely sparse annotations. Extensive experiments on various
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our new approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-arts alternatives.

the inner solar system. However, currently the asteroids have orbits with all
possible values of eccentricities and inclinations compatible with long-term
dynamical stability, whereas the initial planetesimal orbits should have been
quasi-circular and almost co-planar. The total mass in the asteroid population
is a small fraction of that existing primordially. Also, asteroids with
different chemical/mineralogical properties are not ranked in an orderly manner
with mean heliocentric distance as one could expect from the existence of a
radial gradient of the temperature in the proto-planetary disk, but they are
partially mixed. These properties show that the asteroid belt has been severely
sculpted by one or a series of processes during its lifetime. This paper
reviews the processes that have been proposed so far, discussing the properties
that they explain and the problems that they are confronted with. Emphasis is
paid to the interplay between the dynamical and the collisional evolution of
the asteroid population, which allows the use of the size distribution to
constrain the dynamical models. We divide the asteroid belt evolution into
three phases. The first phase started during the lifetime of the gaseous
proto-planetary disk, when the giant planets formed and presumably experienced
large-scale migrations, and continued after the removal of the gas, during the
build-up of the terrestrial planets. The second phase occurred after the
removal of the gaseous proto-planetary disk and it became particularly lively
for the asteroid belt when the giant planets suddenly changed their orbits, as
a result of a mutual dynamical instability and the interaction with the
trans-Neptunian planetesimal disk. The third phase covers the aftermath of the
giant planet instability, until today.

dynamic, dark, short-lived structures known as Rapid Redshifted and Blueshifted
Excursions (RREs, RBEs) that are on-disk absorption features observed in the
red and blue wings of spectral lines formed in the chromosphere. We study the
dynamics of RREs and RBEs by tracking their evolution in space and time,
measuring the speed of the apparent motion, line-of-sight Doppler velocity, and
transverse velocity of individual structures. A statistical study of their
measured properties shows that RREs and RBEs have similar occurrence rates,
lifetimes, lengths, and widths. They also display non-periodic, non-linear
transverse motions perpendicular to their axes at speeds of 4 - 31 km/s.
Furthermore, both types of structures either appear as high speed jets and
blobs that are directed outwardly from a magnetic bright point with speeds of
50 - 150 km/s, or emerge within a few seconds. A study of the different
velocity components suggests that the transverse motions along the
line-of-sight of the chromospheric flux tubes are responsible for the formation
and appearance of these redshifted/blueshifted structures. The short lifetime
and fast disappearance of the RREs/RBEs suggests that, similar to type II
spicules, they are rapidly heated to transition region or even coronal
temperatures. We speculate that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability triggered by
observed transverse motions of these structures may be a viable mechanism for
their heating.

autonomous system that should be able to incorporate new pieces of information.
In order to apply the rationality result of belief dynamics theory to various
practical problems, it should be generalized in two respects: first it should
allow a certain part of belief to be declared as immutable; and second, the
belief state need not be deductively closed. Such a generalization of belief
dynamics, referred to as base dynamics, is presented in this paper, along with
the concept of a generalized revision algorithm for knowledge bases (Horn or
Horn logic with stratified negation). We show that knowledge base dynamics has
an interesting connection with kernel change via hitting set and abduction. In
this paper, we show how techniques from disjunctive logic programming can be
used for efficient (deductive) database updates. The key idea is to transform
the given database together with the update request into a disjunctive
(datalog) logic program and apply disjunctive techniques (such as minimal model
reasoning) to solve the original update problem. The approach extends and
integrates standard techniques for efficient query answering and integrity
checking. The generation of a hitting set is carried out through a hyper
tableaux calculus and magic set that is focused on the goal of minimality. The
present paper provides a comparative study of view update algorithms in
rational approach. For, understand the basic concepts with abduction, we
provide an abductive framework for knowledge base dynamics. Finally, we
demonstrate how belief base dynamics can provide an axiomatic characterization
for insertion a view atom to the database. We give a quick overview of the main
operators for belief change, in particular, belief update versus database
update.

the Stagger-grid and synthetic images computed with the radiative transfer code
Optim3D to provide predictions for the transit of Venus in 2004 observed by the
satellite ACRIMSAT. We computed intensity maps from RHD simulation of the Sun
and produced synthetic stellar disk image. We computed the light curve and
compared it to the ACRIMSAT observations and also to the light curves obtained
with solar surface representations carried out using radial profiles with
different limb-darkening laws. We also applied the same spherical tile imaging
method to the observations of center-to-limb Sun granulation with HINODE. We
managed to explain ACRIMSAT observations of 2004 ToV and showed that the
granulation pattern causes fluctuations in the transit light curve. We
evaluated the contribution of the granulation to the ToV. We showed that the
granulation pattern can partially explain the observed discrepancies between
models and data. This confirms that the limb-darkening and the granulation
pattern simulated in 3D RHD Sun represent well what is imaged by HINODE. In the
end, we found that the Venus's aureole contribution during ToV is less intense
than the solar photosphere, and thus negligible. Being able to explain
consistently the data of 2004 ToV is a new step forward for 3D RHD simulations
that are becoming essential for the detection and characterization of
exoplanets. They show that the granulation have to be considered as an
intrinsic incertitude, due to the stellar variability, on precise measurements
of exoplanet transits of, most likely, planets with small diameters.

spectra, the {H~{\sc i}}(7-6) at 12.37$\mu$m and the {H~{\sc i}}(9-7) at
11.32$\mu$m. We detect the {H~{\sc i}}(7-6) line in 46 objects, and the {H~{\sc
i}}(9-7) in 11. We compare these lines with the other most common gas line
detected in {\it Spitzer} spectra, the {[Ne~{\sc iii}]} at 12.81$\mu$m. We
argue that it is unlikely that the {H~{\sc i}} emission originates from the
photoevaporating upper surface layers of the disk, as has been found for the
{[Ne~{\sc iii}]} lines toward low-accreting stars. Using the {H~{\sc
i}}(9-7)/{H~{\sc i}}(7-6) line ratios we find these gas lines are likely
probing gas with hydrogen column densities of 10$^{10}$-10$^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$.
The subsample of objects surrounded by full and transitional disks show a
positive correlation between the accretion luminosity and the {H~{\sc i}} line
luminosity. These two results suggest that the observed mid-IR {H~{\sc i}}
lines trace gas accreting onto the star in the same way as other hydrogen
recombination lines at shorter wavelengths. A pure chromospheric origin of
these lines can be excluded for the vast majority of full and transitional
disks.We report for the first time the detection of the {H~{\sc i}}(7-6) line
in eight young (< 20~Myr) debris disks. A pure chromospheric origin cannot be
ruled out in these objects. If the {H~{\sc i}}(7-6) line traces accretion in
these older systems, as in the case of full and transitional disks, the
strength of the emission implies accretion rates lower than
10$^{-10}$M$_{\odot}$/yr. We discuss some advantages of extending accretion
indicators to longer wavelengths.

mechanics is a so-called Feynman path integral. It plays an important role in
the theory, but it appears as a postulate based on intuition rather than a
well-defined object. All previous attempts to supply Feynman's theory with
rigorous mathematics have not been satisfactory. The difficulty comes from a
need to define a measure on the infinite dimensional space of paths and to
create an integral that would possess all of the properties requested by
Feynman.
  In the present paper, we consider a new approach to defining the Feynman's
path integral, based on the theory developed by P. Muldowney. Muldowney uses
the Henstock integration technique, and non-absolute integrability of the
Fresnel integrals in order to obtain a representation of the Feynman's path
integral as a functional. This approach offers a mathematically rigorous
definition supporting Feynman's intuitive derivations. But in his work,
Muldowney gives only local in space-time solutions. A physical solution to the
non-relativistic Schr\""odinger equation must be global, and it must be given in
the form of a unitary one-parameter group in L^2. The purpose of this paper is
to show that one-dimensional Muldowney's local solutions may be extended to
yield a global solution. Moreover, the global extension can be represented by a
unitary one-parameter group acting in L^2.

when metals were more scarce. We report Kepler spacecraft observations of
Kepler-444, a metal-poor Sun-like star from the old population of the Galactic
thick disk and the host to a compact system of five transiting planets with
sizes between those of Mercury and Venus. We validate this system as a true
five-planet system orbiting the target star and provide a detailed
characterization of its planetary and orbital parameters based on an analysis
of the transit photometry. Kepler-444 is the densest star with detected
solar-like oscillations. We use asteroseismology to directly measure a precise
age of 11.2+/-1.0 Gyr for the host star, indicating that Kepler-444 formed when
the Universe was less than 20% of its current age and making it the oldest
known system of terrestrial-size planets. We thus show that Earth-size planets
have formed throughout most of the Universe's 13.8-billion-year history,
leaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy.
The age of Kepler-444 not only suggests that thick-disk stars were among the

complex streaming flows whose chaotic dynamics appear to destroy long-range

centimetre-scale distances in microtubule-based active nematics, we identify a
non-equilibrium phase characterized by system-spanning orientational order of
defects. This emergent order persists over hours despite defect lifetimes of
only seconds. Similar dynamical structures are observed in coarse-grained
simulations, suggesting that defect-ordered phases are a generic feature of
active nematics.

visual inspection. Then we make some analysis on this sample and finally
provide a list of these Am candidates with 10 relevant parameters. Comparing
with other catalogues, Am candidates selected from LAMOST DR1 are much fainter

computer vision. The key challenge of this problem is how to learn a metric,
such that the instances sharing the same label are more likely close to each
other on the embedded space. However, little attention has been paid to learn
better representations when the data lie on non-linear manifold. Fortunately,
deep learning has led to great success on feature learning recently. Inspired
by the advances of deep learning, we propose a deep transductive
semi-supervised maximum margin clustering approach. More specifically, given
pairwise constraints, we exploit both labeled and unlabeled data to learn a
non-linear mapping under maximum margin framework for clustering analysis.
Thus, our model unifies transductive learning, feature learning and maximum
margin techniques in the semi-supervised clustering framework. We pretrain the
deep network structure with restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) layer by layer
greedily, and optimize our objective function with gradient descent. By
checking the most violated constraints, our approach updates the model
parameters through error backpropagation, in which deep features are learned
automatically. The experimental results shows that our model is significantly
better than the state of the art on semi-supervised clustering.

(CW-THz) waves is required for characterization and frequency calibration of
practical CW-THz sources. We proposed a method for real-time monitoring of the
absolute frequency of CW-THz waves involving temporally parallel, i.e.,
simultaneous, measurement of two pairs of beat frequencies and laser repetition
frequencies based on dual THz combs of photocarriers (PC-THz combs) with
different frequency spacings. To demonstrate the method, THz-comb-referenced
spectrum analyzers were constructed with a dual configuration based on dual
femtosecond lasers. Regardless of the presence or absence of frequency control
in the PC-THz combs, a frequency precision of 10-11 was achieved at a
measurement rate of 100 Hz. Furthermore, large fluctuation of the CW-THz
frequencies, crossing several modes of the PC-THz combs, was correctly
monitored in real time. The proposed method will be a powerful tool for the
research and development of practical CW-THz sources, and other applications.

which includes a phase diagram with six allotropic phases, plutonium is one of
the most complicated pure elements in its solid state. Its anomalous
properties, which are indicative of a very strongly correlated state, are
related to its special position in the periodic table, which is at the boundary
between the light actinides that have itinerant 5$f$ electrons and the heavy
actinides that have localized 5$f$ electrons. As a foundational study to probe
the role of local electronic correlations in Pu, we use the local-density
approximation together with a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulation to
investigate the electronic structure of a single Pu atom that is either
substitutionally embedded in the bulk and or adsorbed on the surface of a Th
host. This is a simpler case than the solid phases of Pu metal, which must also
include the interactions between Pu 5$f$ electrons on different Pu atoms. For
the Pu impurity atom we have found a Kondo resonance peak, which is an
important signature of electronic correlations, in the local density of states
around the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we show that the peak width of this
resonance is narrower for Pu atoms at the surface of Th than for those in the
bulk due to a weakened Pu 5$f$-ligand hybridization at the surface.

attention in multimedia processing and interactions. This work targets on
developing a novel deep model for automatic activity recognition from RGB-D

segments, and learn to discover the temporal structures for a category of
activities, i.e. how the activities to be decomposed in terms of
classification. Our model can be regarded as a structured deep architecture, as
it extends the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by incorporating structure
alternatives. Specifically, we build the network consisting of 3D convolutions
and max-pooling operators over the video segments, and introduce the latent
variables in each convolutional layer manipulating the activation of neurons.
Our model thus advances existing approaches in two aspects: (i) it acts
directly on the raw inputs (grayscale-depth data) to conduct recognition
instead of relying on hand-crafted features, and (ii) the model structure can
be dynamically adjusted accounting for the temporal variations of human
activities, i.e. the network configuration is allowed to be partially activated
during inference. For model training, we propose an EM-type optimization method
that iteratively (i) discovers the latent structure by determining the
decomposed actions for each training example, and (ii) learns the network
parameters by using the back-propagation algorithm. Our approach is validated
in challenging scenarios, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. A large
human activity database of RGB-D videos is presented in addition.

develop a novel technique to objectively identify precipitation associated with

Maritime Continent, the Bight of Panama, Madagascar and the Mediterranean are
found to be regions where land-sea interactions plays a crucial role in the
formation of precipitation. In these regions $\approx$ 40% to 60% of the total

large scale suppressed convective conditions coastal effects tend modulate the
rainfall over the Maritime Continent leading to enhanced rainfall over land

which avoids the limitation of semantic representation power of hand-crafted

resonances, namely in the region outside the geostationary ring. Precisely, we
focus on the 1:2, 1:3, 2:3 resonances, which are located at about 66 931.4 km,
87 705.0 km, 55 250.7 km, respectively. Some of these resonances have been
already exploited in space missions, like XMM-Newton and Integral.
  Our study is mainly based on a Hamiltonian approach, which allows us to get
fast and reliable information on the dynamics in the resonant regions.
Significative results are obtained even by considering just the effect of the
geopotential in the Hamiltonian formulation. For objects (typically space
debris) with high area-to-mass ratio the Hamiltonian includes also the effect
of the solar radiation pressure. In addition, we perform a comparison with the
numerical integration in Cartesian variables, including the geopotential, the
gravitational attraction of Sun and Moon, and the solar radiation pressure.
  We implement some simple mathematical tools that allows us to get information
on the terms which are dominant in the Fourier series expansion of the
Hamiltonian around a given resonance, on the amplitude of the resonant islands
and on the location of the equilibrium points. We also compute the Fast
Lyapunov Indicators, which provide a cartography of the resonant regions,
yielding the main dynamical features associated to the external resonances. We
apply these techniques to analyze the 1:2, 1:3, 2:3 resonances; we consider
also the case of objects with large area-to-mass ratio and we provide an
application to the case studies given by XMM-Newton and Integral.

adhesion or by a small normal load $L$, contact only forms at isolated patches
and fluids can pass through the interface. When the load surpasses a threshold
value, $L_c$, adjacent patches coalesce at a critical constriction, i.e., near
points where the interfacial separation between the undeformed surfaces forms a
saddle point. This process is continuous without adhesion and the interfacial
separation near percolation is fully defined by scaling factors and the sign of
$L_c-L$. The scaling factors lead to a Reynolds flow resistance which diverges
as $(L_c-L)^\beta$ with $\beta = 3.45$. Contact merging and destruction near

Okayasu-Tomatsu. One of the motivations behind the generalization is the fact
that quantum group von Neumann algebras are often infinite even though the
Haagerup property has been defined successfully for locally compact quantum
groups by Daws-Fima-Skalski-White. In this paper, we partly fill this gap by
proving that the von Neumann algebra of a locally compact quantum group with
the Haagerup property has the HAP. This is new even for genuine locally compact
groups.

Fermi surface, the spin fluctuation-mediated superconductivity, and the
composition ratio. In the phosphides, the dXZ and dYZ orbitals barely hybridize
around the Gamma point to give rise to two intersecting ellipse shape Fermi
surfaces. As the arsenic content increases and the Fe-As-Fe bond angle is
reduced, the hybridization increases, so that the two bands are mixed to result
in concentric inner and outer Fermi surfaces, and the orbital character
gradually changes to dxz and dyz, where x-y axes are rotated by 45 degrees from
X-Y. This makes the orbital matching between the electron and hole Fermi
surfaces better and enhances the spin fluctuation within the dxz/yz orbitals.
On the other hand, the hybridization splits the two bands, resulting in a more
dispersive inner band. Hence, there is a trade-off between the density of
states and the orbital matching, thereby locally maximizing the dxz/yz spin
fluctuation and superconductivity in the intermediate regime of As/P ratio. The
consistency with the experiment strongly indicate the importance of the spin
fluctuation played in this series of superconductors.

asymmetry of the Universe via the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy sneutrinos
in which soft supersymmetry breaking terms play two important roles: they
provide the required $CP$ violation and give rise to the mass splitting between
otherwise degenerate sneutrino mass eigenstates within a single generation.
This mechanism is interesting because it can be successful at the lower
temperature regime $T \lesssim 10^9$ GeV in which the conflict with the
overproduction of gravitinos can possibly be avoided. In earlier works, the
leading $CP$ violation is found to be nonzero only if finite temperature
effects are included. By considering generic soft trilinear couplings, we find
two interesting consequences: (1) the leading $CP$ violation can be nonzero
even at zero temperature realizing nonthermal $CP$ violation, and (2) the $CP$
violation is sufficient even far away from the resonant regime allowing soft
supersymmetry breaking parameters to assume natural values at around the TeV
scale. We discuss phenomenological constraints on such scenarios and conclude
that the contributions to charged lepton flavor violating processes are close
to the sensitivities of present and future experiments.

be achieved by regularization methods, which realize a trade-off between the
clustering accuracy and the number of selected variables by using a lasso-type
penalty. However, the calibration of the penalty term can suffer from
criticisms. Model selection methods are an efficient alternative, yet they
require a difficult optimization of an information criterion which involves
combinatorial problems. First, most of these optimization algorithms are based
on a suboptimal procedure (e.g. stepwise method). Second, the algorithms are
often greedy because they need multiple calls of EM algorithms. Here we propose
to use a new information criterion based on the integrated complete-data
likelihood. It does not require any estimate and its maximization is simple and
computationally efficient. The original contribution of our approach is to
perform the model selection without requiring any parameter estimation. Then,
parameter inference is needed only for the unique selected model. This approach

Two graphs G, H are called Ramsey equivalent if they have the same set of

whether there are two non-isomorphic connected graphs that are Ramsey
equivalent. They proved that a clique is not Ramsey equivalent to any other

supportive evidence for a negative answer to the question of Fox et al. by
claiming that for wide classes of graphs, chromatic number is a distinguishing

neutrino opacities, we take into account a baseline set in state-of-the-art
simulations, in which inelastic neutrinoelectron scattering, thermal neutrino
production via pair annihilation and nucleonnucleon bremsstrahlung are
included. While the Einstein field equations and the spatial advection terms in
the radiation-hydrodynamics equations are evolved explicitly, the source terms
due to neutrino-matter interactions and energy shift in the radiation moment
equations are integrated implicitly by an iteration method. To verify our code,
we first perform a series of standard radiation tests with analytical solutions
that include the check of gravitational redshift and Doppler shift. A good
agreement in these tests supports the reliability of the GR multi-energy
neutrino transport scheme. We then conduct several test simulations of
core-collapse, bounce, and shock-stall of a 15Msun star in the Cartesian
coordinates and make a detailed comparison with published results. Our code
performs quite well to reproduce the results of full-Boltzmann neutrino
transport especially before bounce. In the postbounce phase, our code basically
performs well, however, there are several differences that are most likely to
come from the insufficient spatial resolution in our current 3D-GR models. For
clarifying the resolution dependence and extending the code comparison in the
late postbounce phase, we discuss that next-generation Exaflops-class

models, e.g., ligand field theory. We show that together these provide a clear
understanding of the photophysics and in particular the lowest energy triplet
excitation, T$_1$. In order to build a good model relativistic effects need to
be included. The role of spin-orbit coupling is well-known, but scalar
relativistic effects are also large - and are therefore also introduced and
discussed. No expertise in special relativity or relativistic quantum mechanics
is assumed and a pedagogical introduction to these subjects is given. It is
shown that, once both scalar relativistic effects and spin-orbit coupling are
included, time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) provides
quantitatively accurate predictions of the radiative decay rates of the
substates of T$_1$ in phosphorescent organotranstion-metal complexes. We
describe the pseudo-angular momentum model, and show that it reproduces the key
experimental findings. For example, this model provides a simple explanation of
the relative radiative rates of the substates of T$_1$, which differ by orders
of magnitude. Special emphasis is placed on materials with potential
applications as active materials in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and
principles for the design of new complexes are identified on the basis of the

for high-temperature phononic superconductors. However, metallic phases of

measurement of a record superconducting critical temperature of 190 K in a
hydrogen-sulfur compound at 200 GPa of pressure[1], shows that metallization of
hydrogen can be reached at significantly lower pressure by inserting it in the
matrix of other elements. In this work we re-investigate the phase diagram and
the superconducting properties of the H-S system by means of minima hopping
method for structure prediction and Density Functional theory for
superconductors. We also show that Se-H has a similar phase diagram as its
sulfur counterpart as well as high superconducting critical temperature. We
predict SeH3 to exceed 120 K superconductivity at 100 GPa. We show that both
SeH3 and SH3, due to the critical temperature and peculiar electronic
structure, present rather unusual superconducting properties.

populations, but now there is a growing interest in the non-homogenous case.
One of the most important models has been proposed by Lieberman, Hauert and
Nowak, adapting to a weighted directed graph the classical process described by
Moran. The Markov chain associated with the graph can be modified by erasing
all non-trivial loops in its state space, obtaining the so-called Embedded
Markov chain (EMC). The fixation probability remains unchanged, but the
expected time to absorption (fixation or extinction) is reduced. In this paper,
we shall use this idea to compute asymptotically the average fixation
probability for complete bipartite graphs. To this end, we firstly review some
recent results on evolutionary dynamics on graphs trying to clarify some
points. We also revisit the 'Star Theorem' proved by Lieberman, Hauert and
Nowak for the star graphs. Theoretically, EMC techniques allow fast computation
of the fixation probability, but in practice this is not always true. Thus, in
the last part of the paper, we compare this algorithm with the standard Monte
Carlo method for some kind of complex networks.

on the transport properties of molecular nano-conductors. A nano-conductor
connects to two electron leads and two phonon leads, possibly at different

nano-conductor. We focus on its effects on charge and energy transport. We
introduce three approaches. For weak EPI, we use the nonequilibrium Green's
function method to treat it perturbatively. We derive the expressions for the
charge and heat currents. For weak system-lead couplings, we use the quantum
master equation approach. In both cases, we use a simple single level model to
study the effects of EPI on the system's thermoelectric transport properties.
It is also interesting to look at the effect of currents on the dynamics of the
phonon system. For this, we derive a semi-classical generalized Langevin
equation to describe the nano-conductor's atomic dynamics, taking the
nonequilibrium electron system, as well as the rest of the atomic degrees of
freedom as effective baths. We show simple applications of this approach to the
problem of energy transfer between electrons and phonons.

we allow both pairwise and higher order interactions. We construct the prior by
first defining a prior for the neighbourhood system of the MRF, and conditioned
on this we define a prior for the appearance of higher order interactions.
Finally, for the parameter values we adopt a prior that allows for parameter
values to equal, and in this way we reduce the effective number of free
parameters. To sample from a resulting posterior distribution conditioned on an
observed scene we construct a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC)

approximate auxiliary variable algorithm. We demonstrate the usefulness of our

which can hardly be imitated by adjusting other cosmological parameters, and
the intensity of the modulation is determined by the dynamics of $c_T$. Thus
provided that the foreground contribution is under control, high-precision CMB
polarization observations will be able to put tight constraint on the variation
of $c_T$, and so the corresponding theories.

combination of the best-fit parameters derived from the fits can be used to
separate cD galaxies from non-cD BCGs. In particular, cDs and non-cDs show very
different distributions in the $R_e$--$RFF$ plane, where $R_e$ is the effective
radius and $RFF$ (the residual flux fraction) measures the proportion of the
galaxy flux present in the residual images after subtracting the models. In
general, cDs have larger $R_e$ and $RFF$ values than ellipticals. Therefore we
find, in a statistically robust way, a boundary separating cD and non-cD BCGs
in this parameter space. BCGs with cD morphology can be selected with
reasonably high completeness (~75%) and low contamination (~20%). This
automatic and objective technique can be applied to any current or future BCG
sample with good quality images.

for generating exact closures (here expressing joint probabilities in terms of
their constituent marginal probabilities) for susceptible-infectious-removed
(SIR) dynamics on arbitrary graphs (networks). For Poisson transmission and
removal processes, this enables us to obtain a systematic reduction in the
number of differential equations needed for an exact `moment closure'
representation of the underlying stochastic model. We define `transmission
blocks' as a possible extension of the block concept in graph theory and show
that the order at which the exact moment closure representation is curtailed is
the size of the largest transmission block. More generally, approximate
closures of the hierarchy of moment equations for these dynamics are typically
defined for the first and second order yielding mean-field and pairwise models
respectively. It is frequently implied that, in principle, closed models can be
written down at arbitrary order if only we had the time and patience to do
this. However, for epidemic dynamics on networks, these higher-order models
have not been defined explicitly. Here we unambiguously define hierarchies of
approximate closed models that can utilise subsystem states of any order, and
show how well-known models are special cases of these hierarchies.

graphene nucleation density is drastically reduced and crystal growth is

precursor impingement flux during growth. Growth rates as high as 14.7 and 17.5

Thus, single-crystal grains with lateral size of about one millimetre can be
obtained in just one hour. The samples are characterised by optical microscopy,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
Raman spectroscopy as well as selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and

a higgsino-like LSP and small inter-higgsino mass splittings. The small visible
energy release in higgsino decays makes their pair production difficult to
detect at the LHC. Relaxing gaugino mass universality allows for relatively
light winos and binos without violating LHC gluino mass bounds and without
affecting naturalness. In the case where the bino mass M_1<~ \mu, then one
obtains a mixed bino-higgsino LSP with instead sizable w_1-z_1 and z_2-z_1 mass
gaps. The thermal neutralino abundance can match the measured dark matter
density in contrast to models with a higgsino-like LSP where WIMPs (weakly

already be excluded by the IceCube upper bound on the spin-dependent

can have a maximum in the interior of system's state space or on the boundary.
On the boundary we can have another two cases. There the entropy can increase
linearly with increase of the number of particles and in the another case grows
slower than linearly. The main results are approximations of system's sum of

modeling the scattering polarization produced by anisotropic radiation pumping

investigate the hydrogen Ly$\alpha$ line in a 3D model of the solar atmosphere
resulting from a state of the art MHD simulation. At full spatial resolution
the linear polarization signals are very significant all over the solar disk,
with a large fraction of the field of view showing line-center amplitudes well
above the 1% level. Via the Hanle effect the line-center polarization signals
are sensitive to the magnetic field of the model's transition region, even when
its mean field strength is only 15 G. The breaking of the axial symmetry of the
radiation field produces significant forward-scattering polarization in
Ly$\alpha$, without the need of an inclined magnetic field. Interestingly, the
Hanle effect tends to decrease such forward-scattering polarization signals in
most of the points of the field of view. When the spatial resolution is
degraded, the line-center polarization of Ly$\alpha$ drops below the 1% level,
reaching values similar to those previously found in 1D semi-empirical models
(i.e., up to about 0.5%). The center to limb variation of the
spatially-averaged polarization signals is qualitatively similar to that found
in 1D models, with the largest line-center amplitudes at $\mu=\cos\theta\approx
0.4$ ($\theta$ being the heliocentric angle). These results are important, both
for designing the needed space-based instrumentation and for a reliable
interpretation of future observations of the Ly$\alpha$ polarization.

problem of how best to compare and evaluate the goodness of fit of such models
remains open. Existing techniques typically suffer from low power, especially
when used for models with very volatile conditional intensities such as those
used to describe earthquake clusters. This paper proposes a new residual
analysis method for spatial or spatial-temporal point processes involving
inspecting the differences between the modeled conditional intensity and the
observed number of points over the Voronoi cells generated by the observations.
The resulting residuals can be used to construct diagnostic methods of greater
statistical power than residuals based on rectangular grids. Following an
evaluation of performance using simulated data, the suggested method is used to
compare the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model to the Hector Mine

uniform background rate appears to slightly but systematically underpredict
seismicity along the fault and to overpredict seismicity in along the periphery

million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in thousands of individuals,
have been widely used to identify genetic risk variants for complex diseases.
However, most of the variants that have been identified contribute relatively
small increments of risk and only explain a small portion of the genetic
variation in complex diseases. This is the so-called missing heritability
problem. Evidence has indicated that many complex diseases are genetically
related, meaning these diseases share common genetic risk variants. Therefore,
exploring the genetic correlations across multiple related studies could be a
promising strategy for removing spurious associations and identifying
underlying genetic risk variants, and thereby uncovering the mystery of missing
heritability in complex diseases. Results: We present a general and robust
method to identify genetic patterns from multiple large-scale genomic datasets.
We treat the summary statistics as a matrix and demonstrate that genetic
patterns will form a low-rank matrix plus a sparse component. Hence, we
formulate the problem as a matrix recovering problem, where we aim to discover
risk variants shared by multiple diseases/traits and those for each individual
disease/trait. We propose a convex formulation for matrix recovery and an
efficient algorithm to solve the problem. We demonstrate the advantages of our
method using both synthesized datasets and real datasets. The experimental
results show that our method can successfully reconstruct both the shared and
the individual genetic patterns from summary statistics and achieve better
performance compared with alternative methods under a wide range of scenarios.

a discreet character of impurities. Experimental data for superfluid $^3$He in
aerogel and for some of high-$T_c$ superconductors reveal a significant
discrepancy between the observed temperatures $T_c$ of their transitions in the
superfluid or superconducting state and that predicted by the theory. Here a
theoretical scheme is presented for finding corrections to the $T_c$
originating from spatial correlations between impurities. Analysis is limited
to the Ginzburg and Landau temperature region. The shift of $T_c$ with respect
to the pure material is represented as a series in concentration of the
impurities $x$. In the first order on $x$ the conventional mean-field result
for the lowering of $T_c$ is recovered. Contribution of correlations enters the
second order term. It is expressed via the structure factor of the ensemble of
impurities. For superfluid $^3$He in silica aerogel the sign of the correction
corresponds to an enhancement of the $T_c$ so that the resulting pairbreaking
effect of impurities is weakened. When correlation radius of impurities $R$
exceeds the coherence length of the superfluid $\xi_0$ the contribution of
correlations to the shift of $T_c$ acquires a factor $\sim(R/\xi_0)^2$ and the
weakening of the pairbreaking effect becomes appreciable. The presented scheme
is applied to the superfluid $^3$He in aerogel.

detected by Fermi-LAT with a spectrum extending beyond 100 GeV. We analyzed 81
hours of 3C 58 data taken with the MAGIC telescopes and we detected VHE
gamma-ray emission for the first time at TeV energies with a significance of
5.7 sigma and an integral flux of 0.65% C.U. above 1 TeV. The differential
energy spectrum between 400 GeV and 10 TeV is well described by a power-law
function $d\Phi/dE=f_{o}(E/1TeV)^{-\Gamma}$ with
$f_{o}=(2.0\pm0.4stat\pm0.6sys) 10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}TeV^{-1}$ and
$\Gamma=2.4\pm0.2sta\pm0.2sys$. This leads 3C 58 to be the least luminous PWN
ever detected at VHE and the one with the lowest flux at VHE to date. According
to time-dependent models in which electrons up-scatter photon fields, the best
representation favors a distance to the PWN of 2 kpc and FIR comparable to CMB
photon fields. If we consider an unexpectedly high FIR density, the data can
also be reproduced by models assuming a 3.2 kpc distance. A low magnetic field,
far from equipartition, is required to explain the VHE data. Hadronic
contribution from the hosting supernova remnant (SNR) requires unrealistic
energy budget given the density of the medium, disfavoring cosmic ray
acceleration in the SNR as origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission.

Numerical Weather Predictions (NWPs) utilize huge amounts of computing time,

wind speed forecasts perform well in rather high temporal resolution settings.
They consume comparably little computing resources and return reliable
forecasts, if forecasting horizons are not too long. In the recent literature,
spatial interdependence is increasingly taken into consideration. In this paper
we propose a new and quite flexible multivariate model that accounts for
neighbouring weather stations' information and as such, exploits spatial data
at a high resolution. The model is applied to forecasting horizons of up to one
day and is capable of handling a high resolution temporal structure. We use a
periodic vector autoregressive model with seasonal lags to account for the
interaction of the explanatory variables. Periodicity is considered and is
modelled by cubic B-splines. Due to the model's flexibility, the number of
explanatory variables becomes huge. Therefore, we utilize time-saving shrinkage
methods like lasso and elastic net for estimation. Particularly, a relatively
newly developed iteratively re-weighted lasso and elastic net is applied that
also incorporates heteroscedasticity. We compare our model to several
benchmarks. The out-of-sample forecasting results show that the exploitation of
spatial information increases the forecasting accuracy tremendously, in
comparison to models in use so far.

is equipped with an arbitrary number of antennas. To improve the security of
source-destination transmissions, we investigate the antenna selection at the
source and propose the optimal antenna selection (OAS) and suboptimal antenna
selection (SAS) schemes, depending on whether the source node has the global
channel state information (CSI) of both the main link (from source to
destination) and wiretap link (from source to eavesdropper). Also, the
traditional space-time transmission (STT) is studied as a benchmark. We
evaluate the secrecy performance of STT, SAS, and OAS schemes in terms of the
probability of zero secrecy capacity. Furthermore, we examine the generalized
secrecy diversity of STT, SAS, and OAS schemes through an asymptotic analysis
of the probability of zero secrecy capacity, as the ratio between the average
gains of the main and wiretap channels tends to infinity. This is different
from the conventional secrecy diversity which assumes an infinite
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) received at the destination under the condition
that the eavesdropper has a finite received SNR. It is shown that the
generalized secrecy diversity orders of STT, SAS, and OAS schemes are the
product of the number of antennas at source and destination. Additionally,
numerical results show that the proposed OAS scheme strictly outperforms both
the STT and SAS schemes in terms of the probability of zero secrecy capacity.

large similarities shape the hierarchical structure and growth processes in
BRICS countries as well as in Europe and United States, despite their positions

mapped at micro-scale following a cluster analysis of their evolution over the

perform forward-modelling of bremsstrahlung emission and determine the
structure of hard X-ray sources. We use a combination of magnetohydrodynamic

stratification and loop curvature. Then, the obtained electric and magnetic
fields and density distributions are used to calculate electron and proton
trajectories using a guiding-centre approximation, taking into account Coulomb
collisions. It is shown that electric fields in twisted coronal loops can
effectively accelerate protons and electrons to energies up to 10 MeV.
High-energy particles have hard, nearly power-law energy spectra. The volume
occupied by high-energy particles demonstrates radial expansion, which results
in the expansion of the visible hard X-ray loop and a gradual increase in hard
X-ray footpoint area. Synthesised hard X-ray emission reveals strong footpoint
sources and the extended coronal source, whose intensity strongly depends on
the coronal loop density.

charge and orbital ordering in manganites displaying C-type
antiferromaganetism, we study cooperative Jahn-Teller effect in two-band
one-dimensional chains in the regimes of both strong and weak electron-phonon
couplings. These chains exhibit orbital ferromagnetism with only $d_{z^2}$
orbitals being occupied. At strong coupling and in the antiadiabatic regime,
using a controlled analytic nonperturbative treatment that accounts for the
quantum nature of the phonons, we derive the effective polaronic Hamiltonians
for a single chain as well as for interacting identically-long chains. Due to
cooperative effects, these effective Hamiltonians manifest a dominant
next-nearest-neighbor hopping compared to the usual nearest-neighbor hopping
and a significantly enhanced nearest-neighbor repulsion. For densities up to
half filling, upon tuning electron-phonon coupling, interacting-chain
[single-chain] Jahn-Teller systems undergo quantum phase transition from a
charge disordered state to a conducting charge-density-wave state characterized
by a wavevector $\vec{k} = (\pi ,\pi )$ [$k = \pi $]. On the other hand, up to
half filling, a weak coupling analysis reveals a transition from a disordered
state to an insulating charge-density-wave state with a wavevector that depends
linearly on the density; the ordering is analyzed within a Peierls instability
framework involving the dynamic noninteracting susceptibility at nesting
wavevector and phonon frequency. Our analysis provides an opportunity to
identify the regime of electron-phonon coupling in manganites through
experimentally determining the charge-ordering wavevector.

matter in spiral galaxies. To investigate such matters a sample of 12 galaxies,
most with accurate distances, has been composed of which the luminosities are
distributed regularly over a range spanning 2.5 orders of magnitude. Of the
observed high quality and extended rotation curves of these galaxies
decompositions have been made, for four different schemes, each with two free
parameters. For a ""maximum disc fit"" the rotation curves can be well matched,
yet a large range of mass-to-light ratios for the individual galaxies is
required. For the alternative gravitational theory of MOND the rotation curves
can be explained if the fundamental parameter associated with MOND is allowed
as a free parameter. Fixing that parameter leads to a disagreement between the
predicted and observed rotation curves for a few galaxies. When cosmologically
motivated NFW dark matter halos are assumed, the rotation curves for the least
massive galaxies can, by no means, be reproduced; cores are definitively
preferred over cusps. Finally, decompositions have been made for a pseudo
isothermal halo combined with a universal M/L ratio. For the latter, the light
of each galactic disc and bulge has been corrected for extinction and has been
scaled by the effect of stellar population. This scheme can successfully
explain the observed rotations and leads to sub maximum disc mass
contributions. Properties of the resulting dark matter halos are described and
a ratio between dark and baryonic mass of approximately 9 for the least, and of
approximately 5, for the most luminous galaxies has been determined, at the
outermost measured rotation.

integrability of a distribution of vector fields that are related to the
eventual identities for the multiple products involved. Using this fact we show
that in general there can not be multi-flat structures with more than three

bi-flat $F$-manifolds in dimension $2$ and $3$, and tri-flat $F$-manifolds in

can be reduced to the full family of P$_{VI}$ equation and we construct
non-trivial examples of four dimensional tri-flat $F$ manifolds that are
controlled by hypergeometric functions. In the second part of the paper we
extend our analysis to include non-semisimple multi-flat $F$-manifolds. We show

sciences and clustering individuals according to the observed patterns of
interactions allows to uncover a latent structure in the data. Stochastic block
model (SBM) is a popular approach for grouping the individuals with respect to
their social comportment. When several relationships of various types can occur
jointly between the individuals, the data are represented by multiplex networks
where more than one edge can exist between the nodes. In this paper, we extend
the SBM to multiplex networks in order to obtain a clustering based on more
than one kind of relationship. We propose to estimate the parameters --such as
the marginal probabilities of assignment to groups (blocks) and the matrix of
probabilities of connections between groups-- through a variational
Expectation-Maximization procedure. Consistency of the estimates as well as
statistical properties of the model are obtained. The number of groups is
chosen thanks to the Integrated Completed Likelihood criteria, a penalized
likelihood criterion. Multiplex Stochastic Block Model arises in many
situations but our applied example is motivated by a network of French cancer
researchers. The two possible links (edges) between researchers are a direct
connection or a connection through their labs. Our results show strong
interactions between these two kinds of connections and the groups that are
obtained are discussed to emphasize the common features of researchers grouped

infrastructure connecting approximately 200 sensor and actuator nodes in
automobiles by an access point. This is motivated by the considerable savings
in automobile weight, simplification of manufacturability, and future
upgradability.
  A key issue is how to schedule the nodes on the shared access point so as to
provide regular packet delivery. In this and other similar applications, the
mean of the inter-delivery times of packets, i.e., throughput, is not
sufficient to guarantee service-regularity. The time-averaged variance of the
inter-delivery times of packets is also an important metric.
  So motivated, we consider a wireless network where an Access Point schedules
real-time generated packets to nodes over a fading wireless channel. We are
interested in designing simple policies which achieve optimal mean-variance
tradeoff in interdelivery times of packets by minimizing the sum of
time-averaged means and variances over all clients. Our goal is to explore the
full range of the Pareto frontier of all weighted linear combinations of mean
and variance so that one can fully exploit the design possibilities. We
transform this problem into a Markov decision process and show that the problem
of choosing which node's packet to transmit in each slot can be formulated as a
bandit problem. We establish that this problem is indexable and explicitly
derive the Whittle indices. The resulting Index policy is optimal in certain
cases. We also provide upper and lower bounds on the cost for any policy.
Extensive simulations show that Index policies perform better than previously
proposed policies.

implies that the topology of the network is not maintained, so that nodes not

evaluate the performance of the overlay layer using directional random walks

However, this method will increase the amount of used FPGA resource and reduce
the TDC's integrity unavoidably. This paper presents one method of TOT
measurement implemented in a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. In this method, TOT measure
can be achieved in only one TDC input channel. The consumed resources and time
resolution can both be guaranteed. Test shows that this TDC can achieve
resolution better than 15 ps for leading edge measurement and 37 ps for TOT
measurement. Furthermore, the TDC measuring dead time is about 2 clock cycles,
which makes it be good for applications of higher physical event rate

based on the explicit analytical solutions of a wave propagation problem for a

boundary condition on the interior contour of the cloak significantly reduces
the cloaking action in the membrane case, and it also makes cloaking impossible

scientific research. Often these pipelines are resource intensive and require
days of computing time. In such cases, it makes sense to run them over
distributed computer clusters where they can take advantage of the aggregated
resources of many powerful computers. In addition to this, researchers often
want to integrate their workflows into their own web servers. In these cases,
software is needed to manage the submission of jobs from the web interface to
the cluster and then return the results once the job has finished executing.
  Results: We have developed the Job Management System (JMS), a workflow
management system and interface for the Torque resource manager. The JMS
provides users with a user-friendly interface for creating complex workflows
with multiple stages. It integrates this workflow functionality with Torque, a
tool that is used to control and manage batch jobs on distributed computing
clusters. The JMS can be used by researchers to build and run complex
computational pipelines and provides functionality to include these pipelines
in external interfaces. The JMS is currently being used to house a number of
structural bioinformatics pipelines at the Research Unit in Bioinformatics
(RUBi) at Rhodes University.
  Availability: The JMS is an open-source project and is freely available at

the mean returns of individual securities or asset categories are linearly
dependent on underlying economic factors. We introduce the functional
$Q_\gamma$ featuring the expected earnings yield of portfolio minus a penalty
term proportional with a coefficient $\gamma$ to the variance when we keep the
value of the factor levels fixed. The coefficient $\gamma$ plays the role of a
risk-aversion parameter. We find the optimal trading positions that can be
obtained as the solution to a maximization problem for $Q_\gamma$ at any moment
of time. The single-factor case is analyzed in more details. We present a
simple asset allocation example featuring an interest rate which affects a
stock index and also serves as a second investment opportunity. We consider two
possibilities: the interest rate for the bank account is governed by
Vasicek-type and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross dynamics, respectively. Then we compare our
results with the theory of Bielecki and Pliska where the authors employ the
methods of the risk-sensitive control theory thereby using an infinite horizon
objective featuring the long run expected growth rate, the asymptotic variance,
and a risk-aversion parameter similar to $\gamma$.

compact object binaries and the supermassive black hole are a plausible
occurrence. We present results from a numerical study of close to 13 million
such encounters. Consistent with previous studies, we corroborate that, for
binary systems tidally disrupted by the black hole, the component of the binary
remaining bound to the hole has eccentricity ~ 0.97 and circularizes
dramatically by the time it enters the classical LISA band. Our results also
show that the population of surviving binaries merits attention. These binary
systems experience perturbations to their internal orbital parameters with
potentially interesting observational consequences. We investigated the regions
of parameter space for survival and estimated the distribution of orbital
parameters post-encounter. We found that surviving binaries harden and their
eccentricity increases, thus accelerating their merger due gravitational
radiation emission and increasing the predicted merger rates by up to 1%.

2011fe, obtained 981 days after explosion. SN 2011fe exhibits little evolution
since the +593 day optical spectrum, but there are several curious aspects in
this new extremely late-time regime. We suggest that the persistence of the
$\sim5800$~\AA\ feature is due to Na I D, and that a new emission feature at
$\sim7300$~\AA\ may be [Ca II]. Also, we discuss whether the new emission
feature at $\sim6400$~\AA\ might be [Fe I] or the high-velocity hydrogen
predicted by Mazzali et al. The nebular feature at 5200~\AA\ exhibits a linear
velocity evolution of $\sim350$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}$ per 100 days from at least
+220 to +980 days, but the line's shape also changes in this time, suggesting
that line blending contributes to the evolution. At $\sim 1000$ days after
explosion, flux from the SN has declined to a point where contribution from a
luminous secondary could be detected. In this work we make the first
observational tests for a post-impact remnant star and constrain its
temperature and luminosity to $T \gtrsim 10^4$ $\rm K$ and $L \lesssim 10^4$
$\rm L_{\odot}$. Additionally, we do not see any evidence for narrow H$\alpha$
emission in our spectrum. We conclude that observations continue to strongly
exclude many single-degenerate scenarios for SN 2011fe.

charges in the observable universe by an ethereal string. Positive

force due to the action of an energy conservation constraint. Newton's laws of
motion are derived and inertia is explained in accordance with Mach's

understand the expansion history of the Universe. The decelerating expansion in
the radiation era and the matter era is explained without using General
Relativity and the transition from deceleration to acceleration is explained
without the need to introduce a separate 'dark energy' component. The
interaction between Machian strings gives a physical model for modified
Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and is therefore an alternative to 'dark matter'.

  minor edits",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper deals with an abstraction of a unified problem of drug discovery
and pathogen identification. Pathogen identification involves identification of
disease-causing biomolecules. Drug discovery involves finding chemical
compounds, called lead compounds, that bind to pathogenic proteins and
eventually inhibit the function of the protein. In this paper, the lead
compounds are abstracted as inhibitors, pathogenic proteins as defectives, and
the mixture of ""ineffective"" chemical compounds and non-pathogenic proteins as
normal items. A defective could be immune to the presence of an inhibitor in a
test. So, a test containing a defective is positive iff it does not contain its
""associated"" inhibitor. The goal of this paper is to identify the defectives,
inhibitors, and their ""associations"" with high probability, or in other words,
learn the Immune Defectives Graph (IDG) efficiently through group tests. We
propose a probabilistic non-adaptive pooling design, a probabilistic two-stage
adaptive pooling design and decoding algorithms for learning the IDG. For the
two-stage adaptive-pooling design, we show that the sample complexity of the
number of tests required to guarantee recovery of the inhibitors, defectives,
and their associations with high probability, i.e., the upper bound, exceeds
the proposed lower bound by a logarithmic multiplicative factor in the number
of items. For the non-adaptive pooling design too, we show that the upper bound
exceeds the proposed lower bound by at most a logarithmic multiplicative factor
in the number of items.
