  Gravity: a complete study","10 pages",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The post-Minkowskian limit and gravitational wave solutions for general
fourth-order gravity theories are discussed. Specifically, we consider a
Lagrangian with a generic function of curvature invariants $f(R,
R_{\alpha\beta}R^{\alpha\beta},
R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}R^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta})$. It is well known that
when dealing with General Relativity such an approach provides massless
spin-two waves as propagating degree of freedom of the gravitational field
while this theory implies other additional propagating modes in the gravity
spectra. We show that, in general, fourth order gravity, besides the standard
massless graviton is characterized by two further massive modes with a
finite-distance interaction. We find out the most general gravitational wave
solutions in terms of Green functions in vacuum and in presence of matter
sources. If an electromagnetic source is chosen, only the modes induced by
$R_{\alpha\beta}R^{\alpha\beta}$ are present, otherwise, for any $f(R)$ gravity
model, we have the complete analogy with tensor modes of General Relativity.
Polarizations and helicity states are classified in the hypothesis of plane
wave.

technique. For a long time it has been limited to producing rotating solutions,
restricting to the case of a metric and real scalar fields, despite the fact
that Demia\'nski extended it to include more parameters such as a NUT charge.
Recently two independent prescriptions have been given for extending the
algorithm to gauge fields and thus electrically charged configurations. In this
paper we aim to end setting up the algorithm by providing a missing but
important piece, which is how the transformation is applied to complex scalar
fields. We illustrate our proposal through several examples taken from N=2
supergravity, including the stationary BPS solutions from Behrndt et al. and
Sen's axion-dilaton rotating black hole. Moreover we discuss solutions that
include pairs of complex parameters, such as the mass and the NUT charge, or
the electric and magnetic charges, and we explain how to perform the algorithm
in this context (with the example of Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT and dyonic
Kerr-Newman black holes). The final formulation of the DJN algorithm can
possibly handle solutions with five of the six Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski
parameters along with any type of bosonic fields with spin less than two
(exemplified with the SWIP solutions). This provides all the necessary tools
for applications to general matter-coupled gravity and to (gauged)
supergravity.

the control mechanism, the reset mechanism, and the way the model may exhibit

of the HII region. For the first time, we resolve three distinct regions at
microwave frequencies, two of which are part of the same annular diffuse

microwave emission (AME) from RCW175. Fitting the integrated flux density
across the entire region with the currently available spinning dust models,
using physically motivated assumptions, indicates the presence of at least two
spinning dust components: a warm component with a relatively large hydrogen
number density n_H=26.3/cm^3 and a cold component with a hydrogen number
density of n_H=150/cm^3. The present study is an example highlighting the
potential of using high angular-resolution microwave data to break model
parameter degeneracies. Thanks to our spectral coverage and angular resolution,
we have been able to derive one of the first AME maps, at 13.5GHz, showing
clear evidence that the bulk of the AME arises in particular from one of the
source components, with some additional contribution from the diffuse
structure. A cross-correlation analysis with thermal dust emission has shown a
high degree of correlation with one of the regions within RCW175. In the center
of RCW175, we find an average polarized emission at 21.5GHz of
2.2\pm0.2(rand.)\pm0.3(sys.)% of the total emission, where we have included
both systematic and statistical uncertainties at 68% CL. This polarized
emission could be due to sub-dominant synchrotron emission from the region and
is thus consistent with very faint or non-polarized emission associated with
AME.

decelerator. Using parameters closely mimicking previous Zeeman deceleration
experiments, this approach reveals a hitherto unconsidered velocity dependence
of the phase stability which we ascribe to the finite rise and fall times of
the current pulses that generate the magnetic fields inside the deceleration
coils. It is shown that changing the current switch-off times as the sequence
progresses, so as to maintain a constant mean acceleration per pulse, can lead
to a constant phase stability and hence a beam with well-defined
characteristics. We also find that the time overlap between fields of adjacent
coils has an influence on the phase-space acceptance. Previous theoretical and
experimental results suggested unfilled regions in phase space that influence
particle transmission through the decelerator. Our model provides, for the
first time, a means to directly identify the origin of these effects due to
coupling between longitudinal and transverse dynamics. Since optimum phase
stability is restricted to a rather small parameter range in terms of the
reduced position of the synchronous particle, only a limited range of final
velocities can be attained using a given number of coils. We evaluate phase
stability for different Zeeman deceleration sequences, and, by comparison with
numerical three-dimensional particle trajectory simulations, we demonstrate
that our model provides a valuable tool to find optimum parameter sets for
improved Zeeman deceleration schemes. An acceleration-deceleration scheme is
shown to be a useful approach to generating beams with well-defined properties
for variable-energy collision experiments. More generally, the model provides
significant physical insights applicable to other types of particle
decelerators with finite rise and fall time fields.

companion orbiting in an eccentric orbit. Variable flux modulated with the
orbital period of ~26.5 d has been detected from radio to very high-energy
gamma rays. In addition, the system presents a superorbital variability of the
phase and amplitude of the radio outburst with a period of ~4.6 yr. We present
optical photometric observations of LS I +61 303 spanning ~1.5 yr and
contemporaneous Halpha equivalent width (EW Halpha) data. The optical
photometry shows, for the first time, that the known orbital modulation suffers
a positive orbital phase shift and an increase in flux for data obtained 1-yr
apart. This behavior is similar to that already known at radio wavelengths,
indicating that the optical flux follows the superorbital variability as well.
The orbital modulation of the EW Halpha presents the already known superorbital
flux variability but shows, also for the first time, a positive orbital phase
shift. In addition, the optical photometry exhibits a lag of ~0.1-0.2 in
orbital phase with respect to the EW Halpha measurements at similar
superorbital phases, and presents a lag of ~0.1 and ~0.3 orbital phases with
respect noncontemperaneous radio and X-ray outbursts, respectively. The phase
shifts detected in the orbital modulation of thermal indicators, such as the
optical flux and the EW Halpha, are in line with the observed behavior for
nonthermal indicators, such as X-ray or radio emission. This shows that there
is a strong coupling between the thermal and nonthermal emission processes in
the gamma-ray binary LS I +61 303. The orbital phase lag between the optical
flux and the EW Halpha is naturally explained considering different emitting
regions in the circumstellar disk, whereas the secular evolution might be
caused by the presence of a moving one-armed spiral density wave in the disk.

cellular networks is not straightforward due to mm-wave harsh propagation
conditions that limit access availability. In order to overcome this obstacle,
hybrid network architectures are being considered where mm-wave small cells can
exploit an overlay coverage layer based on legacy technology. The additional
mm-wave layer can also take advantage of a functional split between control and
user plane, that allows to delegate most of the signaling functions to legacy
base stations and to gather context information from users for resource
optimization. However, mm-wave technology requires high gain antenna systems to
compensate for high path loss and limited power, e.g., through the use of
multiple antennas for high directivity. Directional transmissions must be also
used for the cell discovery and synchronization process, and this can lead to a
non-negligible delay due to the need to scan the cell area with multiple
transmissions at different directions. In this paper, we propose to exploit the
context information related to user position, provided by the separated control
plane, to improve the cell discovery procedure and minimize delay. We
investigate the fundamental trade-offs of the cell discovery process with
directional antennas and the effects of the context information accuracy on its

analytic functions of the action integrals to extended distribution functions

simple, but physically-motivated, functional forms for the metallicity of the
interstellar medium as a function of radius and time and for the star-formation
rate, and a model for the diffusion of stars through phase space to suggest the
required functional form of an EDF. We introduce a simple prescription for
radial migration that preserves the overall profile of the disc while allowing
individual stars to migrate throughout the disc. Our models explicitly consider
the thin and thick discs as two distinct components separated in age.
  We show how an EDF can be used to incorporate realistic selection functions
in models, and to construct mock catalogues of observed samples. We show that
the selection function of the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS) biases in favour
of young stars, which have atypically small random velocities. With the
selection function taken into account our models produce good fits of the GCS
data in chemo-dynamical space and the Gilmore and Reid (1983) density data.
  From our EDF, we predict the structure of the SEGUE G-dwarf sample. The
kinematics are successfully predicted. The predicted metallicity distribution
has too few stars with [Fe/H]$\simeq-0.5$ dex and too many metal-rich stars. A
significant problem may be the lack of any chemical-kinematic correlations in
our thick disc. We argue that EDFs will prove essential tools for the analysis
of both observational data and sophisticated models of Galaxy formation and
evolution.

the sample fully amorphous at 25.2 GPa. The sample retains the amorphous state
after pressure release. To understand the pressure-induced amorphization
process, we have studied theoretically the possible high-pressure phases of
Tl2O3. Although a phase transition is predicted at 5.8 GPa to the orthorhombic
Rh2O3-II-type structure and at 24.2 GPa to the orthorhombic a-Gd2S3-type
structure, neither of these phases were observed experimentally, probably due
to the hindrance of the pressure-driven phase transitions at room temperature.
The theoretical study of the elastic behavior of the cubic bixbyite-type

temperature might be caused by the mechanical instability of the cubic

blind extrapolation of the low-energy effective Lagrangian, at least
qualitatively. Hence, Higgs inflation arises as an approximate `mirage' picture

optical wavelengths, or in emission in the far-infrared. Several studies have
found that radiative transfer models that successfully explain the optical
extinction in edge-on spiral galaxies generally underestimate the observed
FIR/submm fluxes by a factor of about three. In order to investigate this
so-called dust energy balance problem, we use two Milky Way-like galaxies
produced by high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations. We create mock optical
edge-on views of these simulated galaxies (using the radiative transfer code
SKIRT), and we then fit the parameters of a basic spiral galaxy model to these
images (using the fitting code FitSKIRT). The basic model includes smooth
axisymmetric distributions along a S\'ersic bulge and exponential disc for the
stars, and a second exponential disc for the dust. We find that the dust mass
recovered by the fitted models is about three times smaller than the known dust
mass of the hydrodynamical input models. This factor is in agreement with
previous energy balance studies of real edge-on spiral galaxies. On the other
hand, fitting the same basic model to less complex input models (e.g. a smooth
exponential disc with a spiral perturbation or with random clumps), does
recover the dust mass of the input model almost perfectly. Thus it seems that
the complex asymmetries and the inhomogeneous structure of real and
hydrodynamically simulated galaxies are a lot more efficient at hiding dust
than the rather contrived geometries in typical quasi-analytical models. This
effect may help explain the discrepancy between the dust emission predicted by
radiative transfer models and the observed emission in energy balance studies
for edge-on spiral galaxies.

associate with differences in ICL assembly process, formation epoch, and/or ICL

colors to metallicity. For three of the four clusters we find clear negative
gradients that, on average, decrease from super solar in the central regions of
the BCG to sub-solar in the ICL. Such negative color/metallicity gradients can
arise from tidal stripping of L* galaxies and/or the disruption of dwarf
galaxies, but not major mergers with the BCG. We also find that the ICL at 110
kpc has a color comparable to m*+2 red sequence galaxies and a total luminosity
between 10<r<110 kpc of 4-8 L*. This suggests that the ICL is dominated by
stars liberated from galaxies with L>0.2 L* and that neither dwarf disruption
nor major mergers with the BCG alone can explain the observed level of
luminosity and remain consistent with either the observed evolution in the
faint end slope of the luminosity function or predictions for the number of BCG
major mergers since z=1. Taken together, the results of this pilot study are

region through momentum transfer with a champagne flow of ionized gas, set up
by a chance encounter between the L1630 molecular cloud and the star cluster of
$\sigma$ Ori. We observe two clearly separated dust populations inside the
ionized gas, that show different observational properties, as well as
contrasting optical properties. Population A is colder ($\sim$ 25 K) than
predicted by widely-used dust models, its temperature is insensitive to an
increase of the impinging radiation field, is momentum-coupled to the gas, and
efficiently absorbs radiation pressure to form a dust wave at 1.0 pc ahead of
$\sigma$ Ori AB. Population B is characterized by a constant [20/30] flux ratio

less efficient in absorbing radiation pressure, forming a dust wave at 0.1 pc

characteristics of population A are remarkable and can not be explained by

Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV) for scalar quarks we study the effects of
intergenerational squark mixing on $B$-physics observables, electroweak
precision observables (EWPO) and the Higgs boson mass predictions. Squark
mixing is generated through the Renormalization Group Equations (RGE) running
from the GUT scale to the electroweak scale due to presence of non diagonal
Yukawa matrices in the RGE's, e.g. due to the CKM matrix. We find that the
$B$-Physics observables as well as the Higgs mass predictions do not receive
sizable corrections. On the other hand, the EWPO such as the $W$ boson mass can
receive corrections by far exceeding the current experimental precision. These
contributions can place new upper bounds on the CMSSM parameter space. We
extend our analysis to the CMSSM extended with a mechanism to explain neutrino
masses (CMSSM-seesaw I), which induces flavor violation in the scalar lepton
sector. Effects from slepton mixing on the analyzed observables are in general
smaller than from squark mixing, but can reach the level of the current
experimenal uncertainty for the EWPO.

sodium D$_1$ line at 5896 \AA\ has remained enigmatic since its discovery
nearly two decades ago. One reason is that the theory of polarized scattering
has not been experimentally tested for multi-level atomic systems in the
relevant parameter domains, although the theory is continually being used for
the interpretation of astrophysical observations. A laboratory experiment that
was set up a decade ago to find out whether the D$_1$ enigma is a problem of
solar physics or quantum physics revealed that the D$_1$ system has a rich
polarization structure in situations where standard scattering theory predicts
zero polarization, even when optical pumping of the $m$ state populations of
the hyperfine-split ground state is accounted for. Here we show that the
laboratory results can be modeled in great quantitative detail if the theory is
extended to include the coherences in both the initial and final states of the
scattering process. Radiative couplings between the allowed dipole transitions
generate coherences in the initial state. Corresponding coherences in the final
state are then demanded by a phase closure selection rule. The experimental
results for the well understood D$_2$ line are used to constrain the two free
parameters of the experiment, collision rate and optical depth, to suppress the
need for free parameters when fitting the D$_1$ results.

enriched. We examine this connection by performing a suite of cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations, exploring a range of parameters based on the galaxy
formation model developed in Vogelsberger et al. 2013 (henceforth V13). We
examine the effects of AGN feedback, wind mass loading, wind specific energy,
and wind metal-loading on the properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of
galaxies with $M_\text{halo} > 10^{11} M_\odot$. Note that while the V13 model
was tuned to match observations including the stellar mass function, no
explicit tuning was done for the CGM. The wind energy per unit outflow mass has
the most significant effect on the CGM enrichment. High energy winds launch
metals far beyond the virial radius. AGN feedback also has a significant
effect, but only at $z < 3$. We compare to high redshift HI and CIV
observations. All our simulations produce the observed number of Damped
Lyman-$\alpha$ Absorbers. At lower column density, several of our simulations
produce enough Lyman Limit Systems (LLS) $100$ kpc from the galaxy, but in all
cases the LLS abundance falls off with distance faster than observations, with
too few LLS at $200$ kpc. Further, in all models the CIV abundance drops off
too sharply with distance, with too little CIV $100$-$200$ kpc from the galaxy.
Higher energy wind models produce more extended CIV but also produce less
stars, in tension with star-formation rate density observations. This
highlights the fact that circumgalactic observations are a strong constraint on
galactic feedback models.

multiple generations of stars are present in these clusters then, as a
consequence, young (<1 Gyr) clusters with similar properties should have age
spreads of the same order. In this paper we use archival Hubble Space Telescope

that none of the clusters analyzed in this work shows evidence for an extended
star formation history that would be consistent with the age spreads proposed
for intermediate age LMC clusters. Tests with artificial single age clusters
show that the fitted age dispersion of the youngest clusters is consistent with
spreads that are purely induced by photometric errors. As an additional result
we determined a new age of NGC 1850 of ~100 Myr, significantly higher than the

the first to focus on the vertical self-potential distribution prior to and
during a saline tracer test. A coupled hydrogeophysical modeling framework is
used to simulate the SP response to precipitation and saline tracer
infiltration. A layered hydrological model is first obtained by inverting
dielectric and matric potential data. The resulting model that compares
favorably with electrical resistance tomography models is subsequently used to
predict the SP response. The electrokinetic contribution (caused by water
fluxes in a charged porous soil) is modeled by an effective excess charge
approach that considers both water saturation and pore water salinity. Our
results suggest that the effective excess charge evolution prior to the tracer
injection is better described by a recent flux-averaged model based on soil
water retention functions than by a previously proposed volume-averaging model.
This is the first time that raw vertically distributed SP measurements have
been explained by a physically based model. The electrokinetic contribution
cannot alone reproduce the SP data during the tracer test and an
electro-diffusive contribution (caused by concentration gradients) is needed.
The predicted amplitude of this contribution is too small to perfectly explain
the data, but the shape is in accordance with the field data. This discrepancy
is attributed to imperfect descriptions of electro-diffusive phenomena in
partially saturated soils, unaccounted soil heterogeneity, and discrepancies
between the measured and predicted electrical conductivities in the tracer
infiltration area.

livestock communities that is consistent with the definition of a livestock

stars of different types and, in particular, more than a hundred RR Lyrae
stars. We have conducted a variability survey of $\omega$ Cen in the NIR, using
ESO's 4.1m Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA). This is
the first paper of a series describing our results.
  $\omega$ Cen was observed using VIRCAM mounted on VISTA. A total of 42 and
100 epochs in $J$ and $K_{\rm S}$, respectively, were obtained, distributed
over a total timespan of 352 days. PSF photometry was performed, and periods of
the known variable stars were improved when necessary using an ANOVA analysis.
  An unprecedented homogeneous and complete NIR catalogue of RR Lyrae stars in
the field of $\omega$ Cen was collected, allowing us to study, for the first
time, all the RR Lyrae stars associated to the cluster, except 4 located far
away from the cluster center. Membership status, subclassifications between
RRab and RRc subtypes, periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes were derived
for all the stars in our sample. Additionally, 4 new RR Lyrae stars were
discovered, 2 of them with high probability of being cluster members. The
distribution of $\omega$ Cen stars in the Bailey (period-amplitude) diagram is
also discussed. Reference lines in this plane, for both Oosterhoff type I (OoI)
and II (OoII) components, are provided.
  In the present paper, we clarify the status of many (candidate) RR Lyrae
stars that had been unclear in previous studies. This includes stars with
anomalous positions in the color-magnitude diagram, uncertain periods or/and
variability types, and possible field interlopers. We conclude that $\omega$
Cen hosts a total of 88 RRab and 101 RRc stars, for a grand total of 189 likely
members. We confirm that most RRab stars in the cluster belong to an OoII
component, as previously found using visual data.

efficient aortic valve closure, but our understanding of the functional
importance of the elasticity and geometry of the aortic root continues to
evolve as increasingly detailed in vivo imaging data become available. Herein,
we describe fluid-structure interaction models of the aortic root, including
the aortic valve leaflets, the sinuses of Valsalva, the aortic annulus, and the
sinotubular junction, that employ a version of Peskin's immersed boundary (IB)
method with a finite element (FE) description of the structural elasticity. We
develop both an idealized model of the root with three-fold symmetry of the
aortic sinuses and valve leaflets, and a more realistic model that accounts for
the differences in the sizes of the left, right, and noncoronary sinuses and
corresponding valve cusps. As in earlier work, we use fiber-based models of the
valve leaflets, but this study extends earlier IB models of the aortic root by
employing incompressible hyperelastic models of the mechanics of the sinuses
and ascending aorta using a constitutive law fit to experimental data from
human aortic root tissue. In vivo pressure loading is accounted for by a
backwards displacement method that determines the unloaded configurations of
the root models. Our models yield realistic cardiac output at physiological
pressures, with low transvalvular pressure differences during forward flow,
minimal regurgitation during valve closure, and realistic pressure loads when
the valve is closed during diastole. Further, results from high-resolution
computations demonstrate that IB models of the aortic valve are able to produce
essentially grid-converged dynamics at practical grid spacings for the
high-Reynolds number flows of the aortic root.

atmospheric boundary layer during the MATERHORN Program are used to describe
the structure of turbulence in katabatic flows. Turbulent and mean
meteorological data were continuously measured at multiple levels at four
towers deployed along the East lower slope (2-4 deg) of Granite Mountain. The
multi-level observations made during a 30-day long MATERHORN-Fall field
campaign in September-October 2012 allowed studying of temporal and spatial
structure of katabatic flows in detail, and herein we report turbulence and
their variations in katabatic winds. Observed vertical profiles show steep
gradients near the surface, but in the layer above the slope jet the vertical
variability is smaller. It is found that the vertical (normal to the slope)
momentum flux and horizontal (along the slope) heat flux in a slope-following
coordinate system change their sign below and above the wind maximum of a
katabatic flow. The vertical momentum flux is directed downward (upward)
whereas the horizontal heat flux is downslope (upslope) below (above) the wind
maximum. Our study therefore suggests that the position of the jet-speed
maximum can be obtained by linear interpolation between positive and negative
values of the momentum flux (or the horizontal heat flux) to derive the height
where flux becomes zero. It is shown that the standard deviations of all wind
speed components (therefore the turbulent kinetic energy) and the dissipation
rate of turbulent kinetic energy have a local minimum, whereas the standard
deviation of air temperature has an absolute maximum at the height of
wind-speed maximum. We report several cases where the vertical and horizontal
heat fluxes are compensated. Turbulence above the wind-speed maximum is
decoupled from the surface, and follows the classical local z-less predictions
for stably stratified boundary layer.

of the planet passing in front of its parent star. The obscuration of part of
the stellar disk during a transit will reveal aspects of its surface structure
resulting from general centre-to-limb variations (CLVs). These become apparent
when forming the ratio between the stellar light in and out of transit. These
phenomena can be seen particularly clearly during the progress of a penumbral
lunar eclipse, where the Earth transits the solar disk and masks different
regions of the solar disk as the eclipse progresses. When inferring the
properties of the planetary atmosphere, it is essential that this effect
originating at the star is properly accounted for. Using the data observed from
the 2014-April-15 lunar eclipse with the ESPaDOnS spectrograph mounted on the
Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), we have obtained for the first time a
time sequence of the penumbral spectra. These penumbral spectra enable us to
study the centre-to-limb variations of solar Fraunhofer lines when the Earth is
transiting Sun. The Na i and Ca ii absorption features reported from previous
lunar eclipse observations are demonstrated to be CLV features, which dominate
the corresponding line profiles and mask possible planetary signal. Detecting
atmospheric species in exoplanets via transit spectroscopy must account for the
CLV effect.

anisotropy in redshift space. We find that the cross-correlation power spectrum
can be detected using $400 ~ \, \rm hrs$ observation with SKA-mid (phase 1) and
a futuristic BOSS like experiment with a quasar (QSO) density of $30 ~ \rm

standard Milky-Way type galaxy has been studied as a function of star formation
history, initial mass function (IMF) and metallicity and of the binary-star
common-envelope ejection process. The model provides birth rates, merger rates
and total numbers of DNS as a function of time. The GW signal produced by this
population has been computed and expressed in terms of a hypothetical space GW
detector (eLISA) by calculating the number of discrete GW signals at different
confidence levels, where `signal' refers to detectable GW strain in a given
frequency-resolution element. In terms of the parameter space explored, the
number of DNS-originating GW signals is greatest in regions of recent star
formation, and is significantly increased if metallicity is reduced from 0.02
to 0.001, consistent with Belczynski10a. Increasing the IMF power-law index
(from --2.5 to --1.5) increases the number of GW signals by a large factor.
This number is also much higher for models where the common-envelope ejection
is treated using the $\alpha-$mechanism (energy conservation) than when using
the $\gamma-$mechanism (angular-momentum conservation). We have estimated the
total number of detectable DNS GW signals from the Galaxy by combining
contributions from thin disc, thick disc, bulge and halo. The most probable

effect of switching from a baseline policy to a new policy. One critical
shortcoming of classical experimental methods, however, is that they typically
do not take into account the dynamic nature of response to policy changes. For
instance, in an experiment where we seek to understand the effects of a new ad
pricing policy on auction revenue, agents may adapt their bidding in response
to the experimental pricing changes. Thus, causal effects of the new pricing
policy after such adaptation period, the {\em long-term causal effects}, are
not captured by the classical methodology even though they clearly are more
indicative of the value of the new policy. Here, we formalize a framework to
define and estimate long-term causal effects of policy changes in multiagent
economies. Central to our approach is behavioral game theory, which we leverage
to formulate the ignorability assumptions that are necessary for causal
inference. Under such assumptions we estimate long-term causal effects through
a latent space approach, where a behavioral model of how agents act conditional
on their latent behaviors is combined with a temporal model of how behaviors
evolve over time.

existing CR routing protocols to achieve high throughput in multi-channel
cognitive radio networks (CRNs). Inter-session network coding and opportunistic
routing can leverage the broadcast nature of the wireless channel to improve
the performance for CRNs. In this paper we present a coding aware opportunistic

preference of a new node to get attached to old nodes is determined by the
local and global property of the old nodes. We consider that local and global
properties of a node as the degree and relative average degree of the node
respectively. We prove that the degree distribution of complex networks
generated by CDPAM follow power law with exponent lies in the interval [2, 3]
and the expected diameter grows logarithmically with the size of new nodes
added in the initial small network. Numerical results show that the expected
diameter stabilizes when alike weights to the local and global properties are
assigned by the new nodes. Computing various measures including clustering
coefficient, assortativity, number of triangles, algebraic connectivity,
spectral radius, we show that the proposed model replicates properties of real
networks better than BA model for all these measures when alike weights are
given to local and global property. Finally, we observe that the BA model is a
limiting case of CDPAM when new nodes tend to give large weight to the local
property compared to the weight given to the global property during link
formation.

quartic one. It has the form of the exponent function with the first, second,
third and fourth degree of the collective variables. The problem has been
reduced to the Ising model in an external field, the role of which is played by
the generalised chemical potential $\mu^*$. The line $\mu^*(\eta) =0$, where
$\eta$ is the density, is the line of the phase transition. We consider the
isothermal compression of the gas till the point where the phase transition on
the line $\mu^*(\eta) =0$ is reached. When the path of the pressing reaches the
line $\mu^* =0$ in the gas medium, a droplet of liquid springs up. The work for
its formation is obtained, the surface-tension energy is calculated. On the
line $\mu^* =0$ we have a two-phase system: the gas and the liquid (the
droplet) one. The equality of the gas and of the liquid chemical potentials is
proved. The process of pressing is going on. But the pressure inside the system
has stopped, two fixed densities have arisen: one for the gas-phase $\eta_{g} =
\eta_{c} ( 1 - {d}/{2})$ and the other for the liquid-phase $\eta_{l} =
\eta_{c} (1 + {d}/{2} )$ (symmetrically to the rectlinear diameter), where
$\eta_{c} = 0.13044$ is the critical density. Starting from that moment the
external pressure works as a latent work of pressure. Its value is obtained. As
a result, the gas-phase disappears and the whole system turns into liquid. The

of WGM resonant frequencies in disk resonators, we investigate the effect of
the geometry and transverse mode order on the total group-velocity dispersion
($GVD$). We demonstrate that the major radii and the radial mode indices play
an important role in tailoring the $GVD$ of WGM resonators. In particular, our
study shows that in WGM disk-resonators, the polar families of modes have very
similar $GVD$, while the radial families of modes feature dispersion values
that can differ by up to several orders of magnitude. The effect of these giant
dispersion shifts are experimentally evidenced in Kerr comb generation with
magnesium fluoride. From a more general perspective, this critical feature
enables to push the zero-dispersion wavelength of fluorite crystals towards the
mid-infrared (mid-IR) range, thereby allowing for efficient Kerr comb
generation in that spectral range. We show that barium fluoride is the most
interesting crystal in this regard, due to its zero dispersion wavelength
($ZDW$) at $1.93 \rm{\mu m}$ and an optimal dispersion profile in the mid-IR
regime. We expect our results to facilitate the design of different platforms

recent years. However, measurement traces from real-world production
environment show that the duration of tasks within a job vary widely. The
overall elapsed time of a job, i.e. the so-called flowtime, is often dictated
by one or few slowly-running tasks within a job, generally referred as the
""stragglers"". The cause of stragglers include tasks running on
partially/intermittently failing machines or the existence of some localized
resource bottleneck(s) within a MapReduce cluster. To tackle this online job
scheduling challenge, we adopt the task cloning approach and design the
corresponding scheduling algorithms which aim at minimizing the weighted sum of
job flowtimes in a MapReduce cluster based on the Shortest Remaining Processing
Time scheduler (SRPT). To be more specific, we first design a 2-competitive
offline algorithm when the variance of task-duration is negligible. We then
extend this offline algorithm to yield the so-called SRPTMS+C algorithm for the
online case and show that SRPTMS+C is $(1+\epsilon)-speed$
$o(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})-competitive$ in reducing the weighted sum of job
flowtimes within a cluster. Both of the algorithms explicitly consider the
precedence constraints between the two phases within the MapReduce framework.
We also demonstrate via trace-driven simulations that SRPTMS+C can
significantly reduce the weighted/unweighted sum of job flowtimes by cutting
down the elapsed time of small jobs substantially. In particular, SRPTMS+C
beats the Microsoft Mantri scheme by nearly 25% according to this metric.

important facet in investigating the performance and robustness of quantum

breakdown of monotonicity of a metrological figure of merit, called the quantum
interferometric power, which is based on the minimal quantum Fisher information
obtained by local unitary evolution of one part of the system, and can be
interpreted as a quantifier of quantum correlations beyond entanglement. We
investigate our proposed non-Markovianity indicator in two relevant examples.
First, we consider the action of a single-party dephasing channel on a
maximally entangled two-qubit state, by applying the Jamio{\l}kowski-Choi
isomorphism. We observe that the proposed measure is consistent with
established non-Markovianity quantifiers defined using other approaches based
on dynamical divisibility, distinguishability, and breakdown of monotonicity
for the quantum mutual information. Further, we consider the dynamics of
two-qubit Werner states, under the action of a local, single-party amplitude
damping channel, and observe that the nonmonotonic evolution of the quantum
interferometric power is more robust than the corresponding one for
entanglement in capturing the backflow of quantum information associated with
the non-Markovian process. Implications for the role of non-Markovianity in
quantum metrology and possible extensions to continuous variable systems are

consider two different, in terms of the field distribution, versions of model,
namely a Gaussian random-field Ising model and an equal-weight trimodal
random-field Ising model. By implementing a computational approach that maps
the ground-state of the system to the maximum-flow optimization problem of a
network, we employ the most up-to-date version of the push-relabel algorithm
and simulate large ensembles of disorder realizations of both models for a
broad range of random-field values and systems sizes $\mathcal{V}=L\times
L\times L$, where $L$ denotes linear lattice size and $L_{\rm max}=156$. Using
as finite-size measures the sample-to-sample fluctuations of various quantities
of physical and technical origin, and the primitive operations of the
push-relabel algorithm, we propose, for both types of distributions, estimates
of the critical field $h_{\rm c}$ and the critical exponent $\nu$ of the
correlation length, the latter clearly suggesting that both models share the
same universality class. Additional simulations of the Gaussian random-field
Ising model at the best-known value of the critical field provide the magnetic
exponent ratio $\beta/\nu$ with high accuracy and clear out the controversial
issue of the critical exponent $\alpha$ of the specific heat. Finally, we
discuss the infinite-limit size extrapolation of energy- and
order-parameter-based noise to signal ratios related to the self-averaging
properties of the model, as well as the critical slowing down aspects of the

simulate the single-particle time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation. The
simulated wave packet is discretized on a spatial grid and the grid points are
mapped on the ion motional states which define the qubit network. The
localization probability at each grid point is obtained from the population in
the corresponding motional state. The quantum gate is the elementary evolution
operator corresponding to the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation of the
simulated system. The corresponding matrix can be estimated by any numerical
algorithm. The radio-frequency field able to drive this unitary transformation
among the qubit states of the ion is obtained by multi-target optimal control
theory. The ion is assumed to be cooled in the ground motional state and the
preliminary step consists in initializing the qubits with the amplitudes of the
initial simulated wave packet. The time evolution of the localization
probability at the grids points is then obtained by successive applications of
the gate and reading out the motional state population. The gate field is
always identical for a given simulated potential, only the field preparing the
initial wave packet has to be optimized for different simulations. We check the
stability of the simulation against decoherence due to fluctuating electric
fields in the trap electrodes by applying dissipative Lindblad dynamics.

interference between two close lying atomic coherent states in a post-selected
atomic cat state, produced in a system of $N$ identical two-level atoms weakly
interacting with a single photon field. Through the observation of the negative
parts of the Wigner distribution of the post-selected atomic cat state, we find
that the post-selected atomic cat state becomes more nonclassical when the
post-selected polarization state of the single photon field tends toward
becoming orthogonal to its pre-selected state. We show that the small phase
shift in the post-selected atomic cat state can be amplified via measuring the
peak shift of its phase distribution when the post-selected state of the single
photon field is nearly orthogonal to its pre-selected state. We find that the
amplification factor of 15 [5] can be obtained for a sample of 10 [100] atoms.
This effectively provides us with a method to discriminate two close lying
states on the Bloch sphere. We discuss possible experimental implementation of
the scheme, and conclude with a discussion of the Fisher information.

bounds on propagation do not depend on system-size, while the theory of mixing
is mostly based on extensive upper-bounds. In a previous paper, a class of
local Lindbladian operators on arbitrary lattice was constructed, for which the
two effects could be combined. In this paper, we show that for some local

quality and the efficiency of the scientific measurements that users perform.
Part of the background at pulsed spallation neutron sources is caused by, and
time-correlated with, the emission of high energy particles when the proton
beam strikes the spallation target. This prompt pulse ultimately produces a
signal, which can be highly problematic for a subset of instruments and
measurements due to the time-correlated properties, and different to that from
reactor sources. Measurements of this background have been made at both SNS
(ORNL, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) and SINQ (PSI, Villigen, Switzerland). The
background levels were generally found to be low compared to natural
background. However, very low intensities of high-energy particles have been
found to be detrimental to instrument performance in some conditions. Given
that instrument performance is typically characterised by S/N, improvements in
backgrounds can both improve instrument performance whilst at the same time
delivering significant cost savings. A systematic holistic approach is
suggested in this contribution to increase the effectiveness of this.
Instrument performance should subsequently benefit.

question from a modern viewpoint, taking into account linear algebra, shape
theory, numerical analysis, random matrix theory, the Hopf fibration, and much
much more. One of the best distributions of random triangles takes all six
vertex coordinates as independent standard Gaussians. Six can be reduced to
four by translation of the center to $(0,0)$ or reformulation as a 2x2 matrix
problem.
  In this note, we develop shape theory in its historical context for a wide
audience. We hope to encourage other to look again (and differently) at
triangles.
  We provide a new constructive proof, using the geometry of parallelians, of a
central result of shape theory: Triangle shapes naturally fall on a hemisphere.
We give several proofs of the key random result: that triangles are uniformly
distributed when the normal distribution is transferred to the hemisphere. A
new proof connects to the distribution of random condition numbers.
Generalizing to higher dimensions, we obtain the ""square root ellipticity
statistic"" of random matrix theory.
  Another proof connects the Hopf map to the SVD of 2 by 2 matrices. A new
theorem describes three similar triangles hidden in the hemisphere. Many
triangle properties are reformulated as matrix theorems, providing insight to
both. This paper argues for a shift of viewpoint to the modern approaches of
random matrix theory. As one example, we propose that the smallest singular
value is an effective test for uniformity. New software is developed and
applications are proposed.

etc. Here we reset entropy at the turnaround by selecting the introverse
(visible universe) from the extroverse which is generated by the accelerated
expansion. In the model, the observed homogeneity is explained by the low
entropy at the bounce, The observed flatness arises from the contraction
together with the reduction in size between the expanding and contracting
universe. The present flatness is predicted to be very precise.
