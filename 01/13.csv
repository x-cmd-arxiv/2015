sample-induced aberrations. A general strategy to undo the effect of these
aberrations is to apply wavefront correction with a deformable mirror (DM). In
most cases, the DM is placed conjugate to the microscope pupil, called pupil
adaptive optics (AO). When the aberrations are spatially variant, an
alternative configuration involves placing the DM conjugate to the main source
of aberrations, called conjugate AO. We provide theoretical and experimental
comparison of both configurations for the simplified case where spatially
variant aberrations are produced by a well defined phase screen. We pay
particular attention to the resulting correction field of view (FOV). Conjugate
AO is found to provide a significant FOV advantage. While this result is well
known in the astronomy community, our goal here is to recast it specifically
for the optical microscopy community.

investigated. There are two damping mechanisms which are considered to generate
the standing acoustic modes in coronal magnetic loops namely thermal conduction
and radiation. The background temperature is assumed to change temporally due
to optically thin radiation. In particular, the background plasma is assumed to
be radiatively cooling. The effects of cooling on longitudinal slow MHD modes
is analytically evaluated by choosing a simple form of radiative function that
ensures the temperature evolution of the background plasma due to radiation
coincides with the observed cooling profile of coronal loops. The assumption of
low-beta plasma leads to neglect the magnetic field perturbation and eventually
reduces the MHD equations to a 1D system modelling longitudinal MHD
oscillations in a cooling coronal loop. The cooling is assumed to occur on a
characteristic time scale much larger than the oscillation period that
subsequently enables using the WKB theory to study the properties of standing
wave. The governing equation describing the time-dependent amplitude of waves
is obtained and solved analytically. The analytically derived solutions are
numerically evaluated to give further insight into the evolution of the
standing acoustic waves. We find that the plasma cooling gives rise to a
decrease in the amplitude of oscillations. In spite of the reduction in damping
rate caused by rising the cooling, the damping scenario of slow standing MHD
waves strongly increases in hot coronal loops.

the hydrodynamic radius model (HRM) wherein the internal particle structure is
mapped on a hydrodynamic radius parameter for unchanged direct interactions,

self-diffusion coefficient, known to be valid for hard-core interaction, are
shown to apply also for soft pair potentials. We further discuss extensions of

constrained transport algorithms in the last fifteen years, the accurate
description of highly magnetized, relativistic flows with strong shocks
represents still a challenge in numerical RMHD. The present paper focusses in
the accuracy and robustness of several correction algorithms for the conserved
variables, which has become a crucial ingredient in the numerical simulation of
problems where the magnetic pressure dominates over the thermal pressure by
more than two orders of magnitude.
  Two versions of non-relativistic and fully relativistic corrections have been
tested and compared using a magnetized cylindrical explosion with high
magnetization ($ \ge 10^4$) as test. In the non-relativistic corrections, the
total energy is corrected for the difference in the classical magnetic energy
term between the average of the staggered fields and the conservative ones,
before (CA1) and after (CA1') recovering the primitive variables. These
corrections are unable to pass the test at any numerical resolution. The two
relativistic approaches (CA2 and CA2'), correcting also the magnetic terms
depending on the flow speed in both the momentum and the total energy, reveal
as much more robust. These algorithms pass the test succesfully and with very
small deviations of the energy conservation ($\le 10^{-4}$), and very low
values of the total momentum ($\le 10^{-8}$). In particular, the algorithm CA2'
(that corrects the conserved variables after recovering the primitive
variables) passes the test at all resolutions.
  The numerical code used to run all the test cases is briefly described.

The relation between solar surface rotation and sunspot activity
still remains open. Sunspot activity has dramatically reduced in solar cycle 24
and several solar activity indices and flux measurements experienced
unprecedentedly low levels during the last solar minimum.
  Aims. We aim to reveal the momentary variation of solar surface rotation,
especially during the recent years of reducing solar activity. Methods. We used
a dynamic, differentially rotating reference system to determine the best-fit
annual values of the differential rotation parameters of active longitudes of
solar X-ray flares and sunspots in 1977-2012.
  Results. The evolution of rotation of solar active longitudes obtained with
X-ray flares and with sunspots is very similar. Both hemispheres speed up since
the late 1990s, with the southern hemisphere rotating slightly faster than the
north. Earlier, in 1980s, rotation in the northern hemisphere was considerably
faster, but experienced a major decrease in the early 1990s. On the other hand,
little change was found in the southern rotation during these decades. This led
to a positive asymmetry in north-south rotation rate in the early part of the
time interval studied.
  Conclusions. The rotation of both hemispheres has been speeding up at roughly
the same rate since late 1990s, with the southern hemisphere rotating slightly
faster than the north. This period coincides with the start of dramatic
weakening of solar activity, as observed in sunspots and several other solar,
interplanetary and geomagnetic parameters.

  First, we propose a layer of abstraction hiding the complexity of dynamic

creates the illusion of verifying a statically-typed program, the effort
required is equivalent to the statically-typed case.
  Second, we show how the required type information can be efficiently derived

logic, yielding a semi-automatic procedure allowing the user to focus on those
typing problems really requiring his attention. While applying type inference
to dynamically typed programs is a well-established method by now, our approach
complements conventional soft typing systems by offering formal proof as a
third option besides modifying the program (static typing) and accepting the
presence of runtime type errors (dynamic typing).

the transition rate of the beta decay of the 252Cf nucleus on the way to
scission from the exit point for a spontaneous fission process. A rather crude
classical approximation is made for the corresponding damped collective motion
assumed to be one dimensional. Given these assumptions, we only aim in this
paper at providing the order of magnitudes of such a phenomenon. At each
deformation the energy available for beta decay, is determined from such a
dynamical treatment. Then, for a given elongation, transition rates for the
allowed (Fermi) beta decay are calculated from pair correlated wave functions
obtained within a macroscopic-microscopic approach and then integrated over the
time corresponding to the whole descent from exit to scission. The results are
presented as a function of the damping factor (inverse of the characteristic
damping time) in use in our classical dynamical approach. For instance, in the
case of a descent time from the exit to the scission points of about $10^{-
20}$ second, one finds a total rate of beta decay corresponding roughly to 20
events per year and per milligram of 252Cf. The inclusion of pairing
correlations does not affect much these results.

the most likely location of the CLiF region, and the unusual strength of the

(GRBs) are characterized by a bursty behavior and are often interspersed with
long quiescent times. There is compelling evidence that X-ray flares are linked
to prompt gamma-rays. However, the physical mechanism that leads to the complex
temporal distribution of gamma-ray pulses and X-ray flares is not understood.
Here we show that the waiting time distribution (WTD) of pulses and flares
exhibits a power-law tail extending over 4 decades with index ~2 and can be the
manifestation of a common time-dependent Poisson process. This result is robust
and is obtained on different catalogs. Surprisingly, GRBs with many (>=8)
gamma-ray pulses are very unlikely to be accompanied by X-ray flares after the
end of the prompt emission (3.1 sigma Gaussian confidence). These results are
consistent with a simple interpretation: an hyperaccreting disk breaks up into
one or a few groups of fragments, each of which is independently accreted with
the same probability per unit time. Prompt gamma-rays and late X-ray flares are
nothing but different fragments being accreted at the beginning and at the end,
respectively, following the very same stochastic process and likely the same
mechanism.

protoplanetary disks on Type I planet migration using a linear perturbation
analysis in the ideal-MHD limit. We focus on wind-driving disks, in which a
magnetic torque $\propto B_{0z} \partial B_{0\varphi}/\partial z$ (where
$B_{0z}$ and $B_{0\varphi}$ are the equilibrium vertical and azimuthal field
components) induces vertical angular momentum transport. We derive the
governing differential equation for the disk response and identify its
resonances and turning points. For a disk containing a slightly subthermal,
pure-$B_{0z}$ field, the total 3D torque is close to its value in the 2D limit
but remains lower than the hydrodynamic torque. In contrast with the 2D
pure-$B_{0\varphi}$ field model considered by Terquem (2003), inward migration
is not reduced in this case when the field amplitude decreases with radius. The
presence of a subdominant $B_{0\varphi}$ component whose amplitude increases
from zero at $z=0$ has little effect on the torque when acting alone, but in
conjunction with a $B_{0z}$ component it gives rise to a strong torque that
speeds up the inward migration by a factor $\gtrsim 200$. This factor could,
however, be reduced in a real disk by dissipation and magnetic diffusivity
effects. Unlike all previously studied disk migration models, in the
$B_{0z}+\partial B_{0\varphi}/\partial z$ case the dominant contributions to
the torque add with the same sign from the two sides of the planet. We
attribute this behavior to a new mode of interaction wherein a planet moves
inward by plugging into the disk's underlying angular momentum transport
mechanism.

nominal labels can implicitly learn to map attributes to adjectives. Second,
objects and attributes come together in pictures (the same thing is a dog and
it is brown). We can thus achieve better attribute (and object) label retrieval
by treating images as ""visual phrases"", and decomposing their linguistic

feasible against stronger message adversaries: We provide a $k$-uniform $k$-set
agreement algorithm, where the number of system-wide decision values $k$ is not

black holes (MBHs) and to be bounded by a gravitational potential by other
galactic components such as the galactic bulge. Such an environment of NCs
provides a favourable conditions for the BH-BH binary formation by the
gravitational radiation capture due to the high BH number density and velocity
dispersion. We carried out detailed numerical study of the formation of BH
binaries in the NCs using a series of N-body simulations for equal-mass cases.
There is no mass segregation introduced. We have derived scaling relations of
the binary formation rate with the velocity dispersion of the stellar system

vicinity of the island is composed by non hyperbolic areas that almost prevent
the trajectory to visit the island edge. For some specific parameters there are
tiny channels embedded in the non hyperbolic area that are associated to
hyperbolic fixed points present in the neighborhood of the islands. Such
channels allow the trajectory to be injected in the inner portion of the

the barrier also prevents the trajectory to scape from the neighborhood of the

commonplace in enterprise computing, and the power consumption of such data
centers is growing at an unprecedented rate. Adding to the problem is the
inability of the servers to exhibit energy proportionality, i.e., provide
energy-efficient execution under all levels of utilization, which diminishes
the overall energy efficiency of the data center. It is imperative that we
realize effective strategies to control the power consumption of the server and
improve the energy efficiency of data centers. With the advent of Intel Sandy
Bridge processors, we have the ability to specify a limit on power consumption
during runtime, which creates opportunities to design new power-management
techniques for enterprise workloads and make the systems that they run on more
energy-proportional.
  In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to achieve energy
proportionality for enterprise-class server workloads, namely SPECpower_ssj2008
and SPECweb2009 benchmarks, by using Intel's Running Average Power Limit (RAPL)
interfaces. First, we analyze the average power consumption of the full system
as well as the subsystems and describe the energy proportionality of these
components. We then characterize the instantaneous power profile of these
benchmarks within different subsystems using the on-chip energy meters exposed
via the RAPL interfaces. Finally, we present the effects of power limiting on
the energy proportionality, performance, power and energy efficiency of
enterprise-class server workloads. Our observations and results shed light on
the efficacy of the RAPL interfaces and provide guidance for designing
power-management techniques for enterprise-class workloads.

of interstellar He atoms flowing through the solar system, the goal being to
reassess the interstellar He flow vector and to search for evidence of
variability in this vector. We find no evidence that the He beam seen by
Ulysses changes at all from 1994-2007. The direction of flow changes by no more
than ~0.3 deg and the speed by no more than ~0.3 km/s. A global fit to all
acceptable He beam maps from 1994-2007 yields the following He flow parameters:
V_ISM=26.08+/-0.21 km/s, lambda=75.54+/-0.19 deg, beta=-5.44+/-0.24 deg, and
T=7260+/-270 K; where lambda and beta are the ecliptic longitude and latitude
direction in J2000 coordinates. The flow vector is consistent with the original
analysis of the Ulysses team, but our temperature is significantly higher. The
higher temperature somewhat mitigates a discrepancy that exists in the He flow
parameters measured by Ulysses and the Interstellar Boundary Explorer, but does
not resolve it entirely. Using a novel technique to infer photoionization loss
rates directly from Ulysses data, we estimate a density of n_He=0.0196+/-0.0033

workloads. These scale-out workloads are latency-sensitive as they are user
driven. In order to meet strict latency constraints, they require massive
computing infrastructure, which consume significant amount of energy and
contribute to operational costs. This cost is further aggravated by the lack of
energy proportionality in servers. As Internet services become even more
ubiquitous, scale-out workloads will need increasingly larger cluster
installations. As such, we desire an investigation into the energy
proportionality and the mechanisms to improve the power consumption of

  Therefore, in this paper, we study the energy proportionality and power
consumption of clusters in the context of scale-out workloads. Towards this
end, we evaluate the potential of power and resource provisioning to improve
the energy proportionality for this class of workloads. Using data serving, web
searching and data caching as our representative workloads, we first analyze
the component-level power distribution on a cluster. Second, we characterize
how these workloads utilize the cluster. Third, we analyze the potential of
power provisioning techniques (i.e., active low-power, turbo and idle low-power
modes) to improve the energy proportionality of scale-out workloads. We then
describe the ability of active low-power modes to provide trade-offs in power

provisioning techniques. Our study reveals various insights which will help
improve the energy proportionality and power consumption of scale-out

protoplanetary disks on Type I planet migration using a combination of
numerical simulations in 2D and 3D and a linear perturbation analysis.
Steady-state models of such disks require the inclusion of magnetic
diffusivity. To make progress using ideal MHD, we focus on simplified field
configurations, involving purely vertical ($B_z$) and azimuthal ($B_\varphi$)
field components and a combination of the two. For each of the models we
calculate the locations of the relevant resonances and of the turning points,
which delineate the propagation regions of the MHD waves that transport angular
momentum from the planet to the disk. We use both numerical and semianalytic
methods to evaluate the cumulative back torque acting on the planet, and
explore the effect of spatial gradients in the disk's physical variables on the
results. We conclude that, under realistic (3D) circumstances, a large-scale
magnetic field can slow down the inward migration that characterizes the
underlying unmagnetized disk --- by up to a factor of $\sim 2$ when the
magnetic pressure approaches the thermal pressure --- but it cannot reverse it.
A previous inference that a pure-$B_\phi$ field whose amplitude decreases fast
enough with radius leads to outward migration applies only in 2D. In fact, we
find that, in 3D, a pure-$B_\phi$ disk undergoes a rapid transition to

polarized beams in storage rings but in contrast to the continuous-time
treatment in \cite{BEH}, we now employ a discrete-time formalism, beginning
with the $\rm{Poincar\acute{e}}$ maps of the continuous time formalism. We then
substantially extend our toolset and generalize the notions of invariant spin
field and invariant frame field. We revisit some old theorems and prove several
theorems believed to be new. In particular we study two transformation rules,
one of them known and the other new, where the former turns out to be an
$SO(3)$-gauge transformation rule. We then apply the theory to the dynamics of
spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ particle bunches and their density matrix functions,
describing semiclassically the particle-spin content of bunches. Our approach
thus unifies the spin-vector dynamics from the T-BMT equation with the
spin-tensor dynamics and other dynamics. This unifying aspect of our approach
relates the examples elegantly and uncovers relations between the various
underlying dynamical systems in a transparent way. As in \cite{BEH}, the
particle motion is integrable but we now allow for nonlinear particle motion on
each torus. Since this work is inspired by notions from the theory of bundles,
we also provide insight into the underlying bundle-theoretic aspects of the
well-established concepts of invariant spin field, spin tune and invariant
frame field. Since we neglect, as is usual, the Stern-Gerlach force, the
underlying principal bundle is of product formso that we can present the theory
in a fashion which does not use bundle theory. Nevertheless we occasionally
mention the bundle-theoretic meaningof our concepts and we also mention the
similarities with the geometrical approach to Yang-Mills Theory.

freedom or character can be ascribed to the Majorana bound states (MBS) which
can be created at the end of one dimensional non-interacting systems,
corresponding to D, DIII and BDI in the usual classification scheme. We have
found that such a character is directly related to the class of the topological
superconductor and its description by a $\mathbb{Z}$, rather than a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$, invariant which corresponds to the BDI class. We have also
found that the DIII case with mirror symmetry, which supports multiple MBS, is
in fact equivalent to the BDI class with an additional time-reversal symmetry.
In all cases where a character can be given to the Majorana states we show how
to construct the appropriate operator explicitly in various examples. We also
examine the consequences of the Majorana character by considering possible
hybridization of MBS brought into proximity and find that two MBS with the same
character do not hybridize. Finally, we show that having this character or not

S-type) tend to have redder [3.6]-[8.0] colors than carbon stars for a given
[3.6]-[4.5] color due to silicate features increasing the flux in the 8.0
{\mu}m IRAC band. For colors including the 5.8 {\mu}m band, carbon stars
separate into two distinct sequences, likely due to a variable photospheric
C$_3$ feature that is only visible in relatively unobscured, low mass-loss rate
sources. Semiregular variables tend to have smaller IR excess in [3.6]-[8.0]
color than Miras, consistent with the hypothesis that semiregular variables
lose mass discontinuously. Miras have redder colors for longer periods while
semiregular variables do not. Galactic AGB stars follow the period-luminosity
sequences found for the Magellanic Clouds. Mira variables fall along the
fundamental pulsation sequence, while semiregular variables are mostly on
overtone sequences. We also derive a relationship between mass-loss rate and
[3.6]-[8.0] color. The fits are similar in shape to those found by other
authors for AGBs in the LMC, but discrepant in overall normalization, likely
due to different assumptions in the models used to derive mass-loss rates. We
find that IR colors are not unique discriminators of chemical type, suggesting
caution when using color selection techniques to infer the chemical composition

$\lambda$195.12 emission line, formed at 1.5 MK, revealed a number of
large-scale, jet-like structures that showed significant blueshifts. The
structures had either weak or no intensity signal in 193 A filter images from
the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory,
suggesting that the jets are essentially invisible to imaging instruments. The
dark jets are rooted in bright points and occur both within the coronal hole
and at the quiet Sun-coronal hole boundary. They exhibit a wide range of
shapes, from narrow columns to fan-shaped structures, and sometimes multiple
jets are seen close together. A detailed study of one dark jet showed
line-of-sight speeds increasing along the jet axis from 52 to 107 km s$^{-1}$
and a temperature of 1.2-1.3 MK. The low intensity of the jet was due either to
a small filling factor of 2% or to a curtain-like morphology. From the HOP 177

intensity suggests a mass flux around two orders of magnitude lower.

mechanism can equivalently be considered drift down the potential-energy

instability are analysed in this paper. At physical ratios of electron to ion
mass, neither linear nor quasilinear treatment can explain the observation of
large-amplitude perturbations that disrupt the ion streams well before they
become ion-ion unstable. We show here, however, that electron holes, once
formed, continue to grow, driven by the drift mechanism, and if they remain in

uncontrolled growth disrupts the ions. The hole growth calculations provide a
quantitative prediction of hole profile and size evolution. Hole growth appears

sky pixels by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We consider the flux
variations in the region significant if statistical probability of uniformity
is less than $4\times10^{-6}$, which corresponds to 0.05 false detections in
the whole set of 12288 pixels. Close inspection of the detected variable
regions result in identification of 8 sources without previous known
variability. Two of them are included in the second Fermi LAT source catalogue
(FBQS J122424.1+243623 and GB6 J0043+3426) and one (3EG J1424+3734) was
reported by EGRET and also was included in the First Fermi LAT source catalogue
(1FGL), but is missing in the 2FGL. Possible identifications of five other
sources are obtained using NED and SIMBAD databases (1RXS J161939.9+765515, PMN
J2320-6447, PKS 0226-559, PKS J0030-0211, PMN J0225-2603). These new variable
gamma-ray sources demonstrate recurring flaring activity with time scale ~weeks
and have hard spectra. Their spectral energy distributions deviate
significantly from a simple power-law shape and often peak around ~GeV. These
properties of activity are typical for flaring blazars.

Riemann theta functions associated with genus three hyperelliptic Riemann
surfaces. In the case of two loops, the distance $L$ by which they are
separated can be adjusted by continuously varying a specific branch point of
the auxiliary Riemann surface. When $L$ is much larger than the characteristic
size of the loops, then the loops are approximately regarded as local operators
and their correlator as the correlator of two local operators. Similarly, when
a loop is very small compared to the size of another loop, the small loop is
considered as a local operator corresponding to a light supergravity mode.

We

test general relativity. The alternate formula was obtained by expanding the
conventional formula in a Taylor series. We show that the gravitational delay
can be split into several terms including a term due to the coordinate
transformation and terms that are explicitly linked to the light deflection
angle. Our formula is compared numerically with the conventional formula, and
difference in arrival times within 1 ps are found at 1$^\circ$ from the Sun for
a full range of baseline lengths. We conclude that the standard reduction of

displacing the reference radio sources from their original catalogue positions

differential treatment of traffic to generate additional revenue streams from
Content Providers (CPs). While SPs currently only provide best-effort services
to their CPs, it is plausible to envision a model in near future, where CPs are
willing to sponsor quality of service for their content in exchange of sharing
a portion of their profit with SPs. This quality sponsoring becomes invaluable
especially when the available resources are scarce such as in wireless
networks, and can be accommodated in a non-neutral network. In this paper, we
consider the problem of Quality-Sponsored Data (QSD) in a non-neutral network.
In our model, SPs allow CPs to sponsor a portion of their resources, and price
it appropriately to maximize their payoff. The payoff of the SP depends on the
monetary revenue and the satisfaction of end-users both for the non-sponsored
and sponsored content, while CPs generate revenue through advertisement. We
analyze the market dynamics and equilibria in two different frameworks, i.e.
sequential and bargaining game frameworks, and provide strategies for (i) SPs:
to determine if and how to price resources, and (ii) CPs: to determine if and
what quality to sponsor. The frameworks characterize different sets of
equilibrium strategies and market outcomes depending on the parameters of the
market.

factorizable while in the former case it is not. As an example I consider a

demonstrate that the correlation function in time domain is factorizable or not

contrast, the correlation function in energy domain is always factorizable and
thus cannot be used to distinguish single- and multi-particle states.

nanowires with diameters of 6.5 nm and length exceeding microns are synthesized
in aqueous solution by reduction of silver ions within the nanotubular
J-aggregates of an amphiphilic cyanine dye. The time scale of the growth of the
nanowires is of the order of hours and days which provides the unique
possibility to investigate the nucleation, growth, and dissolution of the
nanowires by direct imaging using transmission electron microscopy. It is found
that the initial nucleation and formation of seeds of silver nanostructures
occurs randomly at the outer surface of the aggregates or within the hollow
tube. The growth of the seeds within the inner void of the tubular structures
to nanowires indicates transport of silver atoms, ions, or clusters through the
bilayer wall of the molecular aggregates. This permeability of the aggregates
for silver can be utilized to dissolve the preformed silver wires by oxidative
etching using Cl- ions from dissolved NaCl. Although the nanosystem presented
here is a conceptual rather simple organic-inorganic hybrid, it exhibits growth
and dissolution phenomena not expected for a macroscopic system. These
mechanisms are of general importance for both, the growth and the usage of such

using a mean field model, it has been shown that the combination of motor
activity and finite filament extensibility yields a persistence length scale
over which strain decays. Here we study a similar system, in the complementary
limit of strong noise and moderate extensibility, using Brownian multi-particle
collision dynamics-based numerical simulations that includes the coupling
between motor kinetics and local filament extensibility. While the numerical
model shows deviations from the mean field predictions due to the presence of
strong active noise caused by the variations in individual motor activity,
several qualitative features are still retained. Specifically, for fixed motor
attachment and detachment rates, the decay is length is set by the ratio of the
passive elasticity to the active shear resistance generated by attached motors.
Our study generalizes the notion of persistence in passive thermal systems to
actively driven systems with testable predictions.

hyperbolic initial boundary value problems. Weak well-posedness is associated
with an amplification phenomenon of oscillating waves on the boundary. In the
previous works [CGW14, CW14], we have rigorously justified a weakly nonlinear
regime for semilinear problems. In that case, the forcing term on the boundary
has amplitude O($\epsilon$^2) and oscillates at a frequency O(1/$\epsilon$).
The corresponding exact solution, which has been shown to exist on a time
interval that is independent of $\epsilon$ $\in$ (0,1], has amplitude
O($\epsilon$). In this paper, we deal with the exact same scaling, namely
O($\epsilon$^2) forcing term on the boundary and O($\epsilon$) solution, for
quasilinear problems. In analogy with [CGM03], this corresponds to a strongly
nonlinear regime, and our main result proves solvability for the corresponding
WKB cascade of equations, which yields existence of approximate solutions on a
time interval that is independent of $\epsilon$ $\in$ (0,1]. Existence of exact
solutions close to approximate ones is a stability issue which, as shown in
[CGM03], highly depends on the hyperbolic system and on the boundary
conditions; we do not address that question here. This work encompasses
previous formal expansions in the case of weakly stable shock waves [MR83] and
two-dimensional compressible vortex sheets [AM87]. In particular, we prove
well-posedness for the leading amplitude equation (the ""Mach stem equation"") of

is emerging as a promising testbed for theories of modified gravity.
Conventional applications of this method rely upon the assumption that the
velocity field in the cluster environment is uniquely determined by the cluster
mass profile. Yet, real dark matter halos in N-body simulations are known to
violate the assumption that virial mass determines the configuration space
distribution, an effect known as assembly bias. In this Letter, I show that
assembly bias in simulated dark matter halos also manifests in velocity space.
In the 1-10 Mpc environment surrounding a cluster, high-concentration ""tracer""
halos exhibit a 10-20% larger pairwise-velocity dispersion profile relative to
low-concentration tracer halos of the same mass. This difference is comparable
to the size of the RSD signal predicted by f(R) models designed to account for
the cosmic acceleration. I use the age matching technique to study how
color-selection effects may influence the cluster RSD signal, finding a ~10%
effect due to redder satellites preferentially occupying higher mass halos, and
a ~5% effect due to assembly-biased colors of centrals. In order to use cluster
RSD measurements to robustly constrain modified gravity, we likely will need to
develop empirical galaxy formation models more sophisticated than any in the
current literature.

one or two extended periods of star formation, with the first burst lasting for
at least 100 Myr. As found in earlier work, the observed properties of UFDs can

topics in galaxy formation. This is because it may reveal invaluable insights
into the still debated evolutionary processes governing the growth and assembly
of spheroids. However, direct comparison between models and observations is
usually prevented by the so-called ""progenitor bias"", i.e., new galaxies
entering the observational selection at later epochs, thus eluding a precise
study of how pre-existing galaxies actually evolve in size. To limit this
effect, we here gather data on high-redshift brightest group and cluster
galaxies, evolve their (mean) host halo masses down to z=0 along their main
progenitors, and assign as their ""descendants"" local SDSS central galaxies
matched in host halo mass. At face value, the comparison between high redshift
and local data suggests a noticeable increase in stellar mass of a factor of >2
since z~1, and of >2.5 in mean effective radius. We then compare the inferred
stellar mass and size growth with those predicted by hierarchical models for
central galaxies, selected at high redshifts to closely match the halo and
stellar mass bins as in the data. Only hierarchical models characterized by
very limited satellite stellar stripping and parabolic orbits are capable of
broadly reproducing the stellar mass and size increase of a factor ~2-4
observed in cluster galaxies since z ~1. The predicted, average (major) merger
rate since z~1 is in good agreement with the latest observational estimates.

particular, we demonstrate that ""star formation dilution"" by HII regions causes
a significant bias against AGN selection in low-mass, blue, star-forming,
disk-dominated galaxies. This bias is responsible for the observed preference
of AGNs among high-mass, green, moderately star-forming, bulge-dominated hosts.
We account for the bias and simulate the intrinsic population of emission-line
AGNs using a physically-motivated Eddington ratio distribution, intrinsic AGN
narrow line region line ratios, a luminosity-dependent Lbol/L[OIII] bolometric
correction, and the observed Mbh-sigma relation. These simulations indicate
that, in massive (log(M*/Msun) > 10) galaxies, AGN accretion is correlated with
specific star formation rate but is otherwise uniform with stellar mass. There
is some hint of lower black hole occupation in low-mass (log(M*/Msun) < 10)
hosts, although our modeling is limited by uncertainties in measuring and
interpreting the velocity dispersions of low-mass galaxies. The presence of
star formation dilution means that AGNs contribute little to the observed
strong optical emission lines (e.g., [OIII] and Ha) in low-mass and
star-forming hosts. However the AGN population recovered by our modeling
indicates that feedback by typical (low- to moderate-accretion) low-redshift
AGNs has nearly uniform efficiency at all stellar masses, star formation rates,
and morphologies. Taken together, our characterization of the observational
bias and resultant AGN occupation function suggest that AGNs are unlikely to be
the dominant source of star formation quenching in galaxies, but instead are
fueled by the same gas which drives star formation activity.

velocity (RV) for the M2 dwarf GJ 176 based on spectra taken over 10 years from
the High Resolution Spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. These data are
supplemented with spectra from previous observations with the HIRES and HARPS
spectrographs, and V- and R-band photometry taken over 6 years at the Dyer and
Fairborn observatories. Previous studies of GJ 176 revealed a super-Earth
exoplanet in an 8.8-day orbit. However, the velocities of this star are also
known to be contaminated by activity, particularly at the 39-day stellar
rotation period. We have examined the magnetic activity of GJ 176 using the
sodium I D lines, which have been shown to be a sensitive activity tracer in
cool stars. In addition to rotational modulation, we see evidence of a
long-term trend in our Na I D index, which may be part of a long-period
activity cycle. The sodium index is well correlated with our RVs, and we show
that this activity trend drives a corresponding slope in RV. Interestingly, the
rotation signal remains in phase in photometry, but not in the spectral
activity indicators. We interpret this phenomenon as the result of one or more
large spot complexes or active regions which dominate the photometric
variability, while the spectral indices are driven by the overall magnetic
activity across the stellar surface. In light of these results, we discuss the
potential for correcting activity signals in the RVs of M dwarfs.

to yield unique constraints on the nature of turbulence within protoplanetary
disks. Using a combination of local non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations
and radiative transfer calculations, tailored to properties of the disk around
HD 163296, we assess the ability of ALMA to detect turbulence driven by the
magnetorotational instability (MRI). Our local simulations show that the MRI
produces small-scale turbulent velocity fluctuations that increase in strength
with height above the mid-plane. For a set of simulations at different disk
radii, we fit a Maxell-Boltzmann distribution to the turbulent velocity and
construct a turbulent broadening parameter as a function of radius and height.
We input this broadening into radiative transfer calculations to quantify
observational signatures of MRI-driven disk turbulence. We find that the ratio
of the peak line flux to the flux at line center is a robust diagnostic of
turbulence that is only mildly degenerate with systematic uncertainties in disk
temperature. For the CO(3-2) line, which we expect to probe the most
magnetically active slice of the disk column, variations in the predicted
peak-to-trough ratio between our most and least turbulent models span a range
of approximately 15%. Additional independent constraints can be derived from
the morphology of spatially resolved line profiles, and we estimate the
resolution required to detect turbulence on different spatial scales. We
discuss the role of lower optical depth molecular tracers, which trace regions
closer to the disk mid-plane where velocities in MRI-driven models are
systematically lower.

characterized by their masses and spins and are described by the Kerr metric.
Several parametric spacetimes which deviate from the Kerr metric have been
proposed in order to test this theorem with observations of black holes in both
the electromagnetic and gravitational-wave spectra. Such metrics often contain
naked singularities or closed timelike curves in the vicinity of the compact
objects that can limit the applicability of the metrics to compact objects that
do not spin rapidly, and generally admit only two constants of motion. The
existence of a third constant, however, can facilitate the calculation of
observables, because the equations of motion can be written in first-order
form. In this paper, I design a Kerr-like black hole metric which is regular
everywhere outside of the event horizon, possesses three independent constants
of motion, and depends nonlinearly on four free functions that parameterize
potential deviations from the Kerr metric. This metric is generally not a
solution to the field equations of any particular gravity theory, but can be
mapped to known four-dimensional black hole solutions of modified theories of
gravity for suitable choices of the deviation functions. I derive expressions
for the energy, angular momentum, and epicyclic frequencies of a particle on a
circular equatorial orbit around the black hole and compute the location of the
innermost stable circular orbit. In addition, I write the metric in a
Kerr-Schild-like form, which allows for a straightforward implementation of
fully relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows in this
metric. The properties of this metric make it a well-suited spacetime for
strong-field tests of the no-hair theorem in the electromagnetic spectrum with
black holes of arbitrary spin.

of olivine-like composition, with no convincing evidence of H2O ice mantles.
However, tentative evidence for thick H2O ice mantles on large (a ~ 2.8

elemental Fe resides in compounds other than silicates. Moreover, we find that
the total abundance of elemental O is largely inconsistent with the adopted
reference abundances, indicating that as much as ~156 ppm of interstellar O is
missing along the line of sight. After taking into account additional limits on
the abundance of elemental O in other O-bearing solids, we conclude that any

scales of only a few Schwarzschild radii around the supermassive black holes at

expected to image the shadows of these black holes together with a bright and
narrow ring surrounding their shadows. For a Kerr black hole, the shape of this
photon ring is nearly circular unless the black hole spins very rapidly.
Whether or not, however, astrophysical black holes are truly described by the

have been shown numerically to be asymmetric for small to intermediate spins.
In this paper, I calculate semi-analytic expressions of the shapes of photon
rings around black holes described by a new Kerr-like metric which is valid for
all spins. I show that photon rings in this spacetime are affected by two types
of deviations from the Kerr metric which can cause the ring shape to be highly
asymmetric. I argue that the ring asymmetry is a direct measure of a potential
violation of the no-hair theorem and that both types of deviations can be
detected independently if the mass and distance of the black hole are known. In
addition, I obtain approximate expressions of the diameters, displacements, and

make the assumption that black holes are described by the Kerr metric, which
according to the no-hair theorem characterizes black holes uniquely in terms of
their masses and spins. This fundamental property of black holes can be tested
observationally by measuring potential deviations from the Kerr metric
introduced by a parametrically deformed Kerr-like spacetime. Thermal spectra,
iron lines, and variability have already been studied extensively in several
such metrics, which usually depend on only one particular type of deviation or
contain unphysical regions outside of the compact object. In this paper, I
study these x-ray probes in the background of a new Kerr-like metric which
depends on four independent deviation functions and is free of pathological
regions outside of the event horizon. I show that the observed signals depend
significantly on primarily two types of deviations and that the strong
correlation between the spin and the deviation parameters found previously in
other Kerr-like metrics is partially broken for rapidly spinning black holes.

Galileon-like derivative coupling. It is a non-renormalizable operator and is
strongly coupled at high energy scales. Perturbative analysis does not have a
predictive power any longer there. In general, when the Lagrangian is expanded
around the vacuum, the strong coupling scale is identified as the mass scale
that appears in non-renormalizable operators. In inflationary models, however,
the identification of the strong coupling scale is subtle, since the structures
of the kinetic term as well as the interaction itself can be modified by the
background inflationary dynamics. Therefore, the strong coupling scale depends
on the background. In this letter, we evaluate the strong coupling scale of the
fluctuations around the background in the Higgs G-inflation including the
Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the symmetry breaking. We find that the
system is sufficiently weakly coupled when the scales which we now observe exit
the horizon during inflation and the observational predictions with the
semiclassical treatment are valid. However, we also find that the inflaton
field value at which the strong coupling scale and the Hubble scale meet is
less than the Planck scale. Therefore, we cannot describe the model from the

Kompaneets approximation, to trace supernova remnant (SNR) evolution in these
hostile environments, where radial gas gradients and SMBH tides are present. We
trace the adiabatic evolution of the SNR shock until 50% of the remnant is
either in the radiative phase or is slowed down below the SMBH Keplerian
velocity and is sheared apart. In this way, we obtain shapes and lifetimes of
SNRs as a function of the explosion distance from the SMBH, the gas density
profile and the SMBH mass. As an application, we focus here exclusively on
quiescent SMBHs, because their light may not hamper detections of SNRs and
because we can take advantage of the unsurpassed detailed observations of our
Galactic Centre. Assuming that properties such as gas and stellar content scale
appropriately with the SMBH mass, we study SNR evolution around other quiescent
SMBHs. We find that, for SMBH masses over ~10^7 Msun, tidal disruption of SNRs
can occur at less than 10^4 yr, leading to a shortened X-ray emitting adiabatic
phase, and to no radiative phase. On the other hand, only modest disruption is

evolution, we find that PTF11iqb was a near twin of SN~1998S, although with
weaker interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) at early times, and
stronger CSM interaction at late times. We interpret the spectral changes as
caused by early interaction with asymmetric CSM that is quickly (by day 20)
enveloped by the expanding SN ejecta photosphere, but then revealed again after
the end of the plateau when the photosphere recedes. The light curve can be
matched with a simple model for weak CSM interaction added to the light curve
of a normal SN~II-P. This plateau requires that the progenitor had an extended
H envelope like a red supergiant, consistent with the slow progenitor wind
speed indicated by narrow emission. The cool supergiant progenitor is
significant because PTF11iqb showed WR features in its early spectrum ---

halos with decreasing $m_x$ leads to a shift in the reionization population to
larger halo masses of $M_h > 10^9 M_\odot$ and $ -17 < M_{UV} < -13$ for 1.5
keV WDM. We find that current observations of the electron scattering optical
depth and the Ultra-violet luminosity function are equally compatible with all
the (cold and warm) DM models considered in this work. We propose that global
indicators including the redshift evolution of the stellar mass density and the
stellar mass-halo mass relation, observable with the James Webb Space
Telescope, can be used to distinguish between CDM and WDM (1.5 keV)
cosmologies.

model, we determine the observables at infinity as a function of pulse phase
for different numbers and sizes of hot spots on the surface. We show that the
pulse profiles extracted from both observations can be modeled with a single
hot spot and an antipodal cool component. The size of the hot spot changes from
$\approx 80^{\circ}$ in 2007, 3 months after the onset of a dramatic flux
increase, to $\approx 30^{\circ}$ during the quiescent observation in 2011,
when the pulsed fraction returned to the pre-outburst $\approx$ 65\% level. For
the 2007 observation, we also find that a model consisting of a single 0.4 keV
hot spot with a magnetic field strength of $1.8 \times 10^{14}$ G accounts for
the spectra obtained at three different pulse phases but under predicts the
flux at the pulse minimum, where the contribution to the emission from the
cooler component is non-negligible. The inferred temperature of the spot stays
approximately constant between different pulse phases, in agreement with a
uniform temperature, single hot spot model. These results suggest that the
emitting area grows significantly during outbursts but returns to its
persistent and significantly smaller size within a few year timescale.

best explanation for the redshift--luminosity distribution observed in these

gamma ray bursts, and high-$z$ quasars, conflicts with this conclusion,
indicating instead that the constant expansion rate implied by the $R_{\rm
h}=ct$ Universe is a better fit to the data. The central difficulty with the
use of Type~Ia SNe as standard candles is that one must optimize three or four
nuisance parameters characterizing supernova luminosities simultaneously with
the parameters of an expansion model. Hence in comparing competing models, one
must reduce the data independently for each. We carry~out such a comparison of
$\Lambda$CDM and the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ Universe, using the Supernova Legacy Survey
(SNLS) sample of 252 SN~events, and show that each model fits its individually
reduced data very well. But since $R_{\rm h}=ct$ has only one free parameter
(the Hubble constant), it follows from a standard model selection technique
that it is to be preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, the minimalist version of which
has three (the Hubble constant, the scaled matter density and either the
spatial curvature constant or the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter). We
estimate by the Bayes Information Criterion that in a pairwise comparison, the
likelihood of $R_{\rm h}=ct$ is $\sim 90\%$, compared with only $\sim 10\%$ for
a minimalist form of $\Lambda$CDM, in which dark energy is simply a
cosmological constant. Compared to $R_{\rm h}=ct$, versions of the standard
model with more elaborate parametrizations of dark energy are judged to be even
less likely.

None of the other eight known z~2.30 proto-cluster galaxies lying within the

towards the edge of the PB where several lie. The optical/near-IR magnitudes of
DRG55 (R_AB>27, K_AB=22.3) mean that optical spectroscopic redshifts are
difficult with 10m-class telescopes, but near-IR redshifts would be feasible.
The 24um-implied SFR (210 M_odot yr-1), stellar mass (~10^11 M-odot) and 12CO

the SZ signal or contain point sources that disturb the signal extraction in
the SZ survey. We use the Planck PSZ1 union catalog (Planck Collab- oration et
al. 2013a) in the SDSS region as our sample of SZ selected clusters. We
calculate the angular two-point correlation function (2pcf) for physically
correlated, foreground and background structure in the RedMaPPer SDSS DR8
catalog with respect to each cluster. We compare our results with an optically
selected comparison cluster sample and with theoretical predictions. In
contrast to the hypothesis of no environment-based selection, we find a mean
2pcf for background structures of -0.049 on scales of $\lesssim 40'$,
significantly non-zero at $\sim 4 \sigma$, which means that Planck clusters are
more likely to be detected in regions of low background density. We hypothesize
this effect arises either from background estimation in the SZ survey or from
radio sources in the background. We estimate the defect in SZ signal caused by
this effect to be negligibly small, of the order of $\sim 10^{-4}$ of the
signal of a typical Planck detection. Analogously, there are no implications on
X-ray mass measurements. However, the environ- mental dependence has important
consequences for weak lensing follow up of Planck galaxy clusters: we predict
that projection effects account for half of the mass contained within a 15'
radius of Planck galaxy clusters. We did not detect a background underdensity
of CMASS LRGs, which also leaves a spatially varying redshift dependence of the
Planck SZ selection function as a possible cause for our findings.

warped FRW background the U(1) self-gravitating scalar-gauge field without bulk

the modified brane equations, comparable with a dark energy effect. This is a

propagate in the bulk, the cosmic string can build up a huge angle deficit (or
mass per unit length) by the warp factor. Disturbances in the spatial

used in the analysis of educational data, computerized adaptive testing, and
psychological surveys. However, most IRT models rely on both the assumption
that categories are strictly ordered and the assumption that this ordering is
known a priori. These assumptions are impractical in many real-world scenarios,
such as multiple-choice exams where the levels of incorrectness for the
distractor categories are often unknown. While a number of results exist on IRT
models for unordered categorical data, they tend to have restrictive modeling
assumptions that lead to poor data fitting performance in practice.
Furthermore, existing unordered categorical models have parameters that are
difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for
unordered categorical IRT that we call SPRITE (short for stochastic polytomous
response item model) that: (i) analyzes both ordered and unordered categories,
(ii) offers interpretable outputs, and (iii) provides improved data fitting

explosions of massive stars in spherical symmetry. We explore basic explosion
properties and calibrate PUSH such that the observables of SN1987A are
reproduced. Our simulations are based on the general relativistic hydrodynamics
code AGILE combined with the detailed neutrino transport scheme IDSA for
electron neutrinos and ALS for the muon and tau neutrinos. To trigger
explosions in the otherwise non-exploding simulations, we rely on the
neutrino-driven mechanism. The PUSH method locally increases the energy
deposition in the gain region through energy deposition by the heavy neutrino
flavors. Our setup allows us to model the explosion for several seconds after
core bounce. We explore the progenitor range 18-21M$_{\odot}$. Our studies
reveal a distinction between high compactness (HC) and low compactness (LC)
progenitor models, where LC models tend to explore earlier, with a lower
explosion energy, and with a lower remnant mass. HC models are needed to obtain
explosion energies around 1 Bethe, as observed for SN1987A. However, all the
models with sufficiently high explosion energy overproduce $^{56}$Ni. We
conclude that fallback is needed to reproduce the observed nucleosynthesis
yields. The nucleosynthesis yields of $^{57-58}$Ni depend sensitively on the
electron fraction and on the location of the mass cut with respect to the
initial shell structure of the progenitor star. We identify a progenitor and a
suitable set of PUSH parameters that fit the explosion properties of SN1987A
when assuming 0.1M$_{\odot}$ of fallback. We predict a neutron star with a
gravitational mass of 1.50M$_{\odot}$. We find correlations between explosion
properties and the compactness of the progenitor model in the explored
progenitors. However, a more complete analysis will require the exploration of
a larger set of progenitors with PUSH.

were found at several altitudes. The direction of flow over the poles was found
to very with altitude. Broad regions of up-welling and down-welling were also
found. Predictions of vertical temperature profiles are provided for the Alice

provided for ground-based stellar occultation observations. With this model
methane concentrations of 0.2% and 1.0% and 8 and 24 microbar surface pressures

macroscopic properties of crystalline materials. Their effects are important
and wide-reaching, and range from increased chemical reactivity to enhanced
mechanical properties to vastly increased rates of crystal growth. Dislocations
have therefore been widely studied using traditional techniques such as X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and optical imaging. More recently, advances in microscopy
have allowed their direct visualization. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has
enabled the 2D study of single dislocations while transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), which was initially limited to 2D projections of thin
specimens, can now visualize strain fields in 3D with near atomic resolution.
However, these techniques can- not offer in situ, 3D imaging of the formation

dissolution. Here, we describe how Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI)
can be used to visualize in 3D the entire network of dislocations present

use BCDI to monitor the propagation of the dislocation network during repeated

growth and dissolution mechanisms. These investigations demonstrate the
potential of BCDI for studying the mechanisms underlying the response of
crystalline materials to external stimuli.

controllers to tackle complex sensing and decision problems such as those found

a growing computational burden and, as a result, larger controller latencies.
To maximize robustness to mechanical disturbances by maximizing control
feedback gains, this paper emphasizes the necessity for compromise between
high- and low-level feedback control effort in distributed controllers.
Specifically, the effect of distributed impedance controllers is studied where
damping feedback effort is executed in close proximity to the control plant and
stiffness feedback effort is executed in a latency-prone centralized control
process. A central observation is that the stability of high impedance
distributed controllers is very sensitive to damping feedback delay but much
less to stiffness feedback delay. This study pursues a detailed analysis of
this observation that leads to a physical understanding of the disparity. Then
a practical controller breakdown gain rule is derived to aim at enabling
control designers to consider the benefits of implementing their control
applications in a distributed fashion. These considerations are further
validated through the analysis, simulation and experimental testing on high
performance actuators and on an omnidirectional mobile base.

exponentiating an interaction Hamiltonian $H$. Important examples of
Hamiltonians, often encountered in quantum optics, condensed matter and high
energy physics, are of a general form $H=r(A^\dagger-A)$, where $A$ is a
multimode boson operator and $r$ is the coupling constant. If no simple
factorization formula for the evolution operator exists, the calculation of the
evolution operator is a notoriously difficult problem. In this case the only
available option may be to Taylor expand the operator in $r$ and act on a state
of interest $\psi$. But this brute-force method quickly hits the complexity
barrier since the number of evaluated expressions increases exponentially. We
relate a combinatorial structure called Dyck paths to the action of a boson
word (monomial) and a large class of monomial sums on a quantum state $\psi$.
This allows us to cross the exponential gap and make the problem of a boson
unitary operator evaluation computationally tractable by achieving
polynomial-time complexity for an extensive family of physically interesting
multimode Hamiltonians. We further test our method on a cubic boson Hamiltonian
whose Taylor series is known to diverge for all nonzero values of the coupling
constant and an analytic continuation via a Pad\'e approximant must be
performed.

represents a different type of relationship between the nodes in the network
and is designed to maximize some utility that depends on the topology of that
layer and those of the other layers. We start by generalizing distance-based
network formation to the two-layer setting, where edges are constructed in one
layer (with fixed cost per edge) to minimize distances between nodes that are
neighbors in another layer. We show that designing an optimal network in this
setting is NP-hard. Despite the underlying complexity of the problem, we
characterize certain properties of the optimal networks. We then formulate a
multi-layer network formation game where each layer corresponds to a player
that is optimally choosing its edge set in response to the edge sets of the
other players. We consider utility functions that view the different layers as
strategic substitutes. By applying our results about optimal networks, we show
that players with low edge costs drive players with high edge costs out of the
game, and that hub-and-spoke networks that are commonly observed in
transportation systems arise as Nash equilibria in this game.

multi-wavelength pulsed photons. It has complex radio, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray
pulse profiles with distinct peak phase-separations that challenge the
traditional caustic emission models. Using the single-pole annular gap model
with suitable magnetic inclination angle ($\alpha=40^\circ$) and viewing angle
($\zeta=75^\circ$), we managed to reproduce its pulse profiles of three
wavebands. It is found that the middle radio peak is originated from the core
gap region at high altitudes, and the other two radio peaks are originated from
the annular gap region at relatively low altitudes. Two peaks of both X-ray and
$\gamma$-ray wavebands are fundamentally originated from annular gap region,
while the $\gamma$-ray emission generated from the core gap region contributes
somewhat to the first $\gamma$-ray peak. Precisely reproducing the

enhance spectrum utilization by using unused or less used spectrum in radio
environments. The basic idea of CRNs is to allow secondary users (SUs) access
to licensed spectrum, under the condition that the interference perceived by
the primary users (PUs) is minimal. In CRNs, the channel availability is
uncertainty due to the existence of PUs, resulting in intermittent
communication. Transmission control protocol (TCP) performance may
significantly degrade in such conditions. To address the challenges, some
transport protocols have been proposed for reliable transmission in CRNs. In
this paper we survey the state-of-the-art transport protocols for CRNs. We
firstly highlight the unique aspects of CRNs, and describe the challenges of
transport protocols in terms of PU behavior, spectrum sensing, spectrum
changing and TCP mechanism itself over CRNs. Then, we provide a summary and

several open issues and research challenges. To the best of our knowledge, our

groups and proved that it contains all compact groups, locally compact abelian
groups and connected locally compact groups and is closed under products and
closed subgroups. A topological group G is almost connected if the quotient
group of G by the connected component of its identity is compact. We prove that
an almost connected pro-Lie group is separable iff its weight is not greater

and only if it is a subspace of a separable Hausdorff space. It is proved that
a locally compact (even feathered) topological group G which is a subgroup of a
separable Hausdorff topological group is separable, but the conclusion is false
if it is assumed only that G is homeomorphic to a subspace of a separable
Tychonoff space. Every precompact topological group of weight less than or

recycling. Surprisingly, our scheme gives a better sensitivity for lower QST
efficiencies and with a sufficiently large degree of squeezing can attain
near-Heisenberg-limited sensitivities for arbitrarily small QST efficiencies.
Furthermore, we use the quantum Fisher information to demonstrate the near

locomotion and chemotaxis, fundamental processes in pathogenesis and biofilm
formation. In the BFM, torque is generated at the interface between
transmembrane proteins (stators) and a rotor. It is well-established that the
passage of ions down a transmembrane gradient through the stator complex
provides the energy needed for torque generation. However, the physics involved
in this energy conversion remain poorly understood. Here we propose a
mechanically specific model for torque generation in the BFM. In particular, we
identify two fundamental forces involved in torque generation: electrostatic
and steric. We propose that electrostatic forces serve to position the stator,
while steric forces comprise the actual 'power stroke'. Specifically, we
predict that ion-induced conformational changes about a proline 'hinge' residue
in an $\alpha$-helix of the stator are directly responsible for generating the
power stroke. Our model predictions fit well with recent experiments on a
single-stator motor. Furthermore, we propose several experiments to elucidate
the torque-speed relationship in motors where the number of stators may not be
constant. The proposed model provides a mechanical explanation for several
fundamental features of the flagellar motor, including: torque-speed and
speed-ion motive force relationships, backstepping, variation in step sizes,
and the puzzle of swarming experiments.

duplex (FD) base station (BS) equipped with multiple transmit and receive
antennas communicates with multiple mobile users. We consider two different
scenarios. In the first scenario, we study the case when half duplex (HD)
users, partitioned to either the uplink (UL) set or the downlink (DL) set,
simultaneously communicate with the FD BS. In the second scenario, we study the
case when FD users simultaneously communicate UL and DL data with the FD BS.
Unlike conventional HD only systems, inter-user interference (within the cell)
may severely limit the DoF, and must be carefully taken into account. With the
goal of providing theoretical guidelines for designing such FD systems, we
completely characterize the sum DoF of each of the two different FD cellular
networks by developing an achievable scheme and obtaining a matching upper
bound. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to carefully allocate UL and DL
information streams using interference alignment and beamforming techniques. By
comparing the DoFs of the considered FD systems with those of the conventional
HD systems, we establish the DoF gain by enabling FD operation in various
configurations. As a consequence of the result, we show that the DoF can
approach the two-fold gain over the HD systems when the number of users becomes
large enough as compared to the number of antennas at the BS.

We use advanced 3D NLTE radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
the solar atmosphere to carry out detailed tests of chromospheric diagnostics
at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. Methods. We focused on the
diagnostics of the thermal structure of the chromosphere in the wavelength
bands from 0.4 mm up to 9.6 mm that can be accessed with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) and investigated how these diagnostics
are affected by the instrumental resolution. Results. We find that the
formation height range of the millimeter radiation depends on the location in
the simulation domain and is related to the underlying magnetic structure.
Nonetheless, the brightness temperature is a reasonable measure of the gas
temperature at the effective formation height at a given location on the solar
surface. There is considerable scatter in this relationship, but this is
significantly reduced when very weak magnetic fields are avoided. Our results
indicate that although instrumental smearing reduces the correlation between
brightness and temperature, millimeter brightness can still be used to reliably
diagnose electron temperature up to a resolution of 1"". If the resolution is
more degraded, then the value of the diagnostic diminishes rapidly.
Conclusions. We conclude that millimeter brightness can image the chromospheric
thermal structure at the height at which the radiation is formed. Thus
multiwavelength observations with ALMA with a narrow step in wavelength should
provide sufficient information for a tomographic imaging of the chromosphere.

as low-energy limits of AdS vacua of string/M theory. In an appropriate limit,
the field theories decouple from the rest of string/M theory. Since these vacua
are dual to conformal field theories (CFTs), this relates some of the
observables of these field theories on AdS to a subsector of the dual CFTs. We
exemplify this `rigid holography' by studying in detail the 6d N=(2,0) A_{K-1}
superconformal field theory (SCFT) on AdS_5xS^1, with equal radii for AdS_5 and
for S^1. We choose specific boundary conditions preserving sixteen supercharges
that arise when this theory is embedded into Type IIB string theory on
AdS_5xS^5/Z_K. On R^{4,1}xS^1, this 6d theory has a 5(K-1)-dimensional moduli
space, with unbroken 5d SU(K) gauge symmetry at (and only at) the origin. On
AdS_5xS^1, the theory has a 2(K-1)-dimensional `moduli space' of supersymmetric
configurations. We argue that in this case the SU(K) gauge symmetry is unbroken
everywhere in the `moduli space' and that this 5d gauge theory is coupled to a
4d theory on the boundary of AdS_5 whose coupling constants depend on the
`moduli'. This involves non-standard boundary conditions for the gauge fields
on AdS_5. Near the origin of the `moduli space', the theory on the boundary
contains a weakly coupled 4d N=2 supersymmetric SU(K) gauge theory. We show
that this implies large corrections to the metric on the `moduli space'. The
embedding in string theory implies that the 6d N=(2,0) theory on AdS_5xS^1 with
sources on the boundary is a subsector of the large N limit of various 4d N=2
quiver SCFTs that remains non-trivial in the large N limit. The same subsector
appears universally in many different 4d N=2 SCFTs. We also discuss a
decoupling limit that leads to N=(2,0) `little string theories' on AdS_5xS^1.

efficiencies, i.e., asymptotic variances. To utilize multiple statistics for
accurate measurements, we formulate a mixture sampling problem, through which
we construct a mixture unbiased estimator which minimizes asymptotic variance.
Given fixed sampling budgets for different statistics, we derive the optimal
weights to combine the individual estimators; given fixed total budget, we show
that a greedy allocation towards the most efficient statistics is optimal. In
practice, the sampling efficiencies of statistics can be quite different for
various targets and are unknown before sampling. To solve this problem, we
design a two-stage framework which adaptively spends a partial budget to test
different statistics and allocates the remaining budget to the inferred best
statistics. We show that our two-stage framework is a generalization of 1)
randomly choosing a statistics and 2) evenly allocating the total budget among
all available statistics, and our adaptive algorithm achieves higher efficiency

$\delta>0$ such that when a subject is given two elements to compare, if the
values of those elements (as perceived by the subject) differ by at least
$\delta$, then the comparison will be made correctly; when the two elements
have values that are within $\delta$, the outcome of the comparison is
unpredictable. This model is inspired by both imprecision in human judgment of
values and also by bounded but potentially adversarial errors in the outcomes
of sporting tournaments.
  Our model is closely related to a number of models commonly considered in the
psychophysics literature where $\delta$ corresponds to the {\em just noticeable
difference unit (JND)} or {\em difference threshold}. In experimental
psychology, the method of paired comparisons was proposed as a means for
ranking preferences amongst $n$ elements of a human subject. The method
requires performing all $\binom{n}{2}$ comparisons, then sorting elements
according to the number of wins. The large number of comparisons is performed
to counter the potentially faulty decision-making of the human subject, who
acts as an imprecise comparator.
  We show that in our model the method of paired comparisons has optimal
accuracy, minimizing the errors introduced by the imprecise comparisons.
However, it is also wasteful, as it requires all $\binom{n}{2}$. We show that
the same optimal guarantees can be achieved using $4 n^{3/2}$ comparisons, and
we prove the optimality of our method. We then explore the general tradeoff
between the guarantees on the error that can be made and number of comparisons
for the problems of sorting, max-finding, and selection. Our results provide
strong lower bounds and close-to-optimal solutions for each of these problems.

solutions to the Stokes equations and results given by other numerical methods.
We also illustrate our method's ability to describe spheroidal swimmer shapes
and biologically-relevant time-dependent swimming gaits. We detail the
numerical algorithm used to compute the hydrodynamic coupling between a large
collection ($10^4-10 ^5$) of micro-swimmers. Using this methodology, we
investigate the emergence of polar order in a suspension of squirmers and show
that for large domains, both the steady-state polar order parameter and the
growth rate of instability are independent of system size. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve near continuum-level
results, allowing for better comparison with experimental measurements while
complementing and informing continuum models.

proposed scheme, which is named RoC-ACO-OFDM, instead of simply being dropped
in conventional schemes. The proposed method makes full use of the specific
structure of ACO-OFDM signals in the time domain, where half of the positions
are forced to zeros within an OFDM symbol. The zero-valued positions are
utilized to carry the clipped error information. Moreover, we accordingly
present an optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection for the RoC-ACO-OFDM

efficient detection method is further developed with near-optimal performance.
Simulation results show that the proposed RoC-ACO-OFDM achieves a significant

Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity of images or image patches in a
transform domain or synthesis dictionary to reconstruct images from
undersampled measurements. In this work, we focus on blind compressed sensing,
where the underlying sparsifying transform is a priori unknown, and propose a
framework to simultaneously reconstruct the underlying image as well as the
sparsifying transform from highly undersampled measurements. The proposed block
coordinate descent type algorithms involve highly efficient optimal updates.
Importantly, we prove that although the proposed blind compressed sensing

the objectives defining the formulations. These critical points are guaranteed
to be at least partial global and partial local minimizers. The exact point(s)

the proposed framework for magnetic resonance image reconstruction from highly

period of about eight years and five epochs of X-ray spectroscopy overlapping

observed for the broad emission lines and hot dust emission. In general, the
coronal lines varied only weakly, if at all. Using the optical [Fe VII] and
X-ray O VII emission lines we estimate that the coronal line gas has a
relatively low density of n~10^3 cm^-3 and a relatively high ionisation
parameter of log U~1. The resultant distance of the coronal line gas from the
ionising source is about two light years, which puts this region well beyond
the hot inner face of the obscuring dusty torus. The high ionisation parameter
implies that the coronal line region is an independent entity rather than part
of a continuous gas distribution connecting the broad and narrow emission line
regions. We present tentative evidence for the X-ray heated wind scenario of
Pier & Voit. We find that the increased ionising radiation that heats the dusty
torus also increases the cooling efficiency of the coronal line gas, most

of A1g and E2g1 vibrational modes was recorded as a function of the number of
irradiation pulses. The observed behavior was attributed to laser-induced bond
breaking and subsequent atoms removal due to electronic excitations. The
single-pulse optical damage threshold was determined for the monolayer and bulk
under 800nm and 1030nm pulsed laser irradiation and the role of two-photon
versus one photon absorption effects is discussed.

temperatures represent a promising class of multifunctional materials with high
application potential in spintronics and magneto-optics. In the hexagonal
Fe-doped diluted magnetic oxide, 6H-BaTiO$_{3-\delta}$, room-temperature
ferromagnetism has been previously reported. Ferromagnetism is broadly accepted
as an intrinsic property of this material, despite its unusual dependence on
doping concentration and processing conditions. However, the here reported
combination of bulk magnetization and complementary in-depth local-probe
electron spin resonance and muon spin relaxation measurements, challenges this
conjecture. While a ferromagnetic transition occurs around 700 K, it does so
only in additionally annealed samples and is accompanied by an extremely small
average value of the ordered magnetic moment. Furthermore, several additional
magnetic instabilities are detected at lower temperatures. These coincide with
electronic instabilities of the Fe-doped 3C-BaTiO$_{3-\delta}$ pseudocubic
polymorph. Moreover, the distribution of iron dopants with frozen magnetic
moments is found to be non-uniform. Our results demonstrate that the intricate
static magnetism of the hexagonal phase is not intrinsic, but rather stems from
sparse strain-induced pseudocubic regions. We point out the vital role of
internal strain in establishing defect ferromagnetism in systems with competing
structural phases.

(GFDM) is recently being discussed as a candidate waveform for the fifth
generation of wireless communication systems (5G). GFDM is introduced as a
generalized form of the widely used orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) modulation scheme and since it uses only one cyclic prefix (CP) for a
group of symbols rather than a CP per symbol, it is more bandwidth efficient
than OFDM. In this paper, we propose novel transceiver structures for GFDM by
taking advantage of the particular structure in the modulation matrix. Our
proposed transmitter is based on modulation matrix sparsification through
application of fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce the implementation
complexity. A unified receiver structure for matched filter (MF), zero forcing
(ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers is also derived. The
proposed receiver techniques harness the special block circulant property of
the matrices involved in the demodulation stage to reduce the computational
cost of the system implementation. We have derived the closed forms for the ZF
and MMSE receiver filters. Additionally, our algorithms do not incur any
performance loss as they maintain the optimal performance. The computational
costs of our proposed techniques are analyzed in detail and are compared with
the existing solutions that are known to have the lowest complexity. It is
shown that through application of our transceiver structure a substantial
amount of computational complexity reduction can be achieved.

identify appliances in homes based on their consumption characteristics and the

introduced, tested on real-world data and evaluated with a common evaluation
metric. However, the fair comparison between different NILM approaches even
with the usage of the same evaluation metric is nearly impossible due to
incomplete or missing problem definitions. Each NILM approach typically is
evaluated under different test scenarios. Test results are thus influenced by
the considered appliances, the number of used appliances, the device type
representing the appliance and the pre-processing stages denoising the
consumption data. This paper introduces a novel complexity measure of
aggregated consumption data providing an assessment of the problem complexity
affected by the used appliances, the appliance characteristics and the
appliance usage over time. We test our load disaggregation complexity on
different real-world datasets and with a state-of-the-art NILM approach. The

this manuscript, the opposite limit of polymer in nano-slits with one to
several monomers width is studied, using molecular dynamics simulations.
Extension of the polymer inside nanoslits, confinement force on the plates, and
the effective spring constant of the confined polymer are investigated. Despite
of the theoretical limitations of the blob model, the simulation results are
explained with the blob model very well. The agreement is observed for the
static properties and the dynamic spring constant of the polymer. A theoretical
description of the conditions under which the dynamic spring constant of the
polymer is independent of the small number of monomers inside blobs is given.

strength, parallel diffusion and adiabatic cooling are the main factors in
forming the spatial invariance in SEP spectra, and perpendicular diffusion is a
secondary factor. In addition, the temporal invariance in SEP spectra is mainly
due to the effect of adiabatic cooling. Furthermore, a spectra invariant

optimization of the distribution of untrusted parameters is used to lower bound
the average min-entropy. Under this paranoid analysis, the QRNG remains

framework of nonlinear observability, which is the unknown input observability
problem (UIO problem). The solution here provided holds in the case of a single
unknown input. The first part of the work presents this analytic solution. As
for the observability rank condition, the proposed analytic criterion is based
on the computation of the observable codistribution. Similarly to the case of
only known inputs, the observable codistribution is obtained by recursively
computing the Lie derivatives of the outputs along the vector fields that
characterize the dynamics. However, in correspondence of the unknown input, the
corresponding vector field must be suitably rescaled. Additionally, the Lie
derivatives of the outputs must also be computed along a new set of vector
fields that are obtained by recursively performing suitable Lie bracketing of
the vector fields that define the dynamics. In practice, the entire observable
codistribution is obtained by a very simple recursive algorithm. Finally, it is
shown that the recursive algorithm converges in a finite number of steps and
the criterion to establish that the convergence has been reached is provided.
The proposed analytic extension of the observability rank condition is
illustrated by checking the weak local observability of several nonlinear
systems driven by multiple known inputs and a single unknown input. For these
systems, extensive simulations are also provided. It is shown that, a simple
estimator based on an Extended Kalman Filter, provides results that agree with
our observability analysis. Finally, it is shown that the analytic criterion is
not only a key analytical tool to automatically obtain the state observability
(and so the analytic solution of a fundamental open problem) but it can be also
a fundamental tool for unknown input observer design.

compactness, which proved to be more accurate. The relations using the
effective compactness on the other hand also fit our data accurately. Our
results show that the maximum oscillation frequency depends strongly on the

are challenging issues. In this paper, we investigate the radio resource
management problem for D2D-based V2V communications. Firstly, we analyze and
mathematically model the actual requirements for vehicular communications and
traditional cellular links. Secondly, we propose a problem formulation to
fulfill these requirements, and then a Separate Resource Block allocation and
Power control (SRBP) algorithm to solve this problem. Finally, simulations are
presented to illustrate the improved performance of the proposed SRBP scheme
compared to some other existing methods.

spatial directions. Such nanoscopic systems are suitable for fundamental
studies of quantum mechanics and are candidates for applications such as
quantum information processing. It was also proposed that linear arrangements
of quantum dots could be used as quantum cascade laser. In this work we study
the impact of electron-electron interactions on transport in a spinful serial
triple quantum dot system weakly coupled to two leads. We find that due to
electron-electron scattering processes the transport is enabled beyond the
common single-particle transmission channels. This shows that the scenario in
the serial quantum dots intrinsically deviates from layered structures such as
quantum cascade lasers, where the presence of well-defined single-particle
resonances between neighboring levels are crucial for device operation.
Additionally, we check the validity of the Pauli master equation by comparing
it with the first-order von Neumann approach. Here we demonstrate that
coherences are of relevance if the energy spacing of the eigenstates is smaller
than the lead transition rate multiplied by $\hbar$.

  figures",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatial reaction-diffusion models have been employed to describe many
emergent phenomena in biological systems. The modelling technique most commonly
adopted in the literature implements systems of partial differential equations
(PDEs), which assumes there are sufficient densities of particles that a
continuum approximation is valid. However, due to recent advances in
computational power, the simulation, and therefore postulation, of
computationally intensive individual-based models has become a popular way to
investigate the effects of noise in reaction-diffusion systems in which regions
of low copy numbers exist.
  The stochastic models with which we shall be concerned in this manuscript are
referred to as `compartment-based'. These models are characterised by a
discretisation of the computational domain into a grid/lattice of
`compartments'. Within each compartment particles are assumed to be well-mixed
and are permitted to react with other particles within their compartment or to
transfer between neighbouring compartments.
  We develop two hybrid algorithms in which a PDE is coupled to a
compartment-based model. Rather than attempting to balance average fluxes, our
algorithms answer a more fundamental question: `how are individual particles
transported between the vastly different model descriptions?' First, we present
an algorithm derived by carefully re-defining the continuous PDE concentration
as a probability distribution. Whilst this first algorithm shows strong
convergence to analytic solutions of test problems, it can be cumbersome to
simulate. Our second algorithm is a simplified and more efficient
implementation of the first, it is derived in the continuum limit over the PDE
region alone. We test our hybrid methods for functionality and accuracy in a
variety of different scenarios by comparing the averaged simulations to
analytic solutions of PDEs for mean concentrations.

three-dimensional AFM ($T_{\rm N} \sim$ 125 K) orderings. Below $T_{\rm

significant blue shift as the temperature decreases. Calculations based on a

existence of a local charge imbalance between two different sublattices support
this assignment and explain the blue shift. This view is further supported by
the partial spectral weight analysis showing the onset of optical anisotropy at

consumption compared to conventional DCTs and integer transforms. In this
paper, we introduce a novel 8-point DCT approximation that requires only 14
addition operations and no multiplications. The proposed transform possesses
low computational complexity and is compared to state-of-the-art DCT
approximations in terms of both algorithm complexity and peak signal-to-noise
ratio. The proposed DCT approximation is a candidate for reconfigurable video
standards such as HEVC. The proposed transform and several other DCT
approximations are mapped to systolic-array digital architectures and
physically realized as digital prototype circuits using FPGA technology and
mapped to 45 nm CMOS technology.

ever appealing to spacetime or its geometry. This description is the so-called
shape dynamics description of gravity. The existence of relational first
principles from which the shape dynamics description of gravity can be derived
is a motivation to consider shape dynamics (rather than GR) as the fundamental
description of gravity. Adopting this point of view leads to the question: What
is the role of spacetime in the shape dynamics description of gravity? This
question contains many aspects: Compatibility of shape dynamics with the
description of gravity in terms of spacetime geometry, the role of local
Minkowski space, universality of spacetime geometry and the nature of quantum
particles, which can no longer be assumed to be irreducible representations of
the Poincare group. In this contribution I derive effective spacetime
structures by considering how matter fluctuations evolve along with shape
dynamics. This evolution reveals an ""experienced spacetime geometry."" This
leads (in an idealized approximation) to local Minkowski space and causal
relations. The small scale structure of the emergent geometric picture depends
on the specific probes used to experience spacetime, which limits the
applicability of effective spacetime to describe shape dynamics. I conclude
with discussing the nature of quantum fluctuations (particles) in shape
dynamics and how local Minkowski spacetime emerges from the evolution of
quantum particles.

direction (x or y or z), does not affect two qubit Werner states. On the other
hand the MEMS are affected by x and z components of DM interaction and remain
unaffected by the y component. Further, we find that the state (i.e probability
amplitude) of auxiliary qubit do not affect the quantum correlations in both
the states, only DM interaction strength influences the quantum correlations.
So one can avoid the intention to prepare the specific state of auxiliary qubit
to manipulate the quantum correlations in both the states. We mention here that
avoiding the preparation of state can contribute to cost reduction in quantum
information processing. We also observe the phenomenon of entanglement sudden

boundary layer, and are active, i.e. they transport angular velocity through
Reynolds stresses. An additional simulation with inner cylinder Reynolds number

axial flow was found to convect the TRs without any weakening effect. For
small-gap TC, evidence for the existence of logarithmic velocity fluctuations,
and of an overlap layer, in which the velocity fluctuations collapse in outer
units, was found. Profiles consistent with a logarithmic dependence were also
found for the angular velocity in large-gap TC, albeit in a very reduced range

compounds into a representation that can be processed by predictive modeling
techniques. This is typically a feature vector where each feature indicates the
presence or absence of a molecular fragment. While the traditional approach to
SAR modeling employed size restricted fingerprints derived from path fragments,
much research in recent years focussed on mining more complex graph based
fragments. Today, there seems to be a growing consensus in the data mining
community that these more expressive fragments should be more useful. We
question this consensus and show experimentally that fragments of low
complexity, i.e. sequences, perform better than equally large sets of more
complex ones, an effect we explain by pairwise correlation among fragments and
the ability of a fragment set to encode compounds from different classes
distinctly. The size restriction on these sets is based on ordering the
fragments by class-correlation scores. In addition, we also evaluate the
effects of using a significance value instead of a length restriction for path
fragments and find a significant reduction in the number of features with
little loss in performance.

$\psi:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^n$ is said to be a $\textit{mapping from $f$ to $g$}$
if it is a bijection and $f(z)=g(\psi(z))$ for every $z\in\{0,1\}^n$. In this
paper we study Lipschitz mappings between boolean functions.
  Our first result gives a construction of a $C$-Lipschitz mapping from the
${\sf Majority}$ function to the ${\sf Dictator}$ function for some universal
constant $C$. On the other hand, there is no $n/2$-Lipschitz mapping in the
other direction, namely from the ${\sf Dictator}$ function to the ${\sf
Majority}$ function. This answers an open problem posed by Daniel Varga in the
paper of Benjamini et al. (FOCS 2014).
  We also show a mapping from ${\sf Dictator}$ to ${\sf XOR}$ that is 3-local,
2-Lipschitz, and its inverse is $O(\log(n))$-Lipschitz, where by $L$-local
mapping we mean that each of its output bits depends on at most $L$ input bits.
  Next, we consider the problem of finding functions such that any mapping
between them must have large \emph{average stretch}, where the average stretch
of a mapping $\phi$ is defined as ${\sf avgStretch}(\phi) = {\mathbb
E}_{x,i}[dist(\phi(x),\phi(x+e_i)]$. We show that any mapping $\phi$ from ${\sf
XOR}$ to ${\sf Majority}$ must satisfy ${\sf avgStretch}(\phi) \geq
\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. In some sense, this gives a ""function analogue"" to the
question of Benjamini et al. (FOCS 2014), who asked whether there exists a set
$A \subset \{0,1\}^n$ of density 0.5 such that any bijection from
$\{0,1\}^{n-1}$ to $A$ has large average stretch.
  Finally, we show that for a random balanced function
$f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^n$ with high probability there is a mapping $\phi$ from
${\sf Dictator}$ to $f$ such that both $\phi$ and $\phi^{-1}$ have constant

so. This property constrains the ensemble of configurations explored at low

glasses. A key feature of marginal states is a (saturated) pseudo-gap in the
distribution of soft excitations. We study how such a pseudo-gap appears
dynamically in the case of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass. After
revisiting and correcting the multi-spin-flip criterion for local stability, we
show that stationarity along the hysteresis loop requires that soft spins are
frustrated among each other, with a correlation that diverges as
$C(\lambda)\sim 1/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the larger of two considered
local fields. We explain how this arises spontaneously in a marginal system and
develop an analogy between the spin dynamics in the SK model and random walks
in two dimensions. We discuss the applicability of these findings to hard

on the elastic pyrochlore lattice. Akin to the Peierls transition in
one-dimensional systems, the coupling of the lattice to the electronic degrees
of freedom can stabilize a spontaneous deformation of the crystal. This
deformation corresponds to a breathing mode, which breaks the inversion
symmetry. We find that for intermediate values of the staggered strain, the
inversion-symmetry broken phase realizes a topological Weyl semimetal. In the
temperature-elasticity phase diagram, the Weyl semimetal shows a reentrant
phase behavior: it can be reached from a symmetric phase realized both at
higher and at lower temperatures. The symmetric phase is a Dirac semimetal,
which is protected by the non-symmorphic space group of the pyrochlore lattice.
Beyond a critical value of the staggered strain, the symmetry-broken phase is a
fully gapped trivial insulator. The surface states of the Weyl semimetal form
open Fermi arcs and we observe that their connectivity depends on the
termination of the crystal. In particular, for the $\{111\}$ films, the
semiclassical closed electronic orbits of the surface states in a magnetic
field cross the bulk either twice, four, six or twelve times. We demonstrate
how one can tune the number of bulk crossings through a Lifshitz-like
transition of the Fermi arcs, which we call Weyl-Lifshitz transition, by
applying a surface potential. Our results offer a route to a topological Weyl
semimetal in nonmagnetic materials and might be relevant for pyrochlore oxides

$A_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Re}} = 0.10 \pm 0.18 \pm 0.05$, where the first
uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. The angular observables
$A_{\mathrm{T}}^{(2)}$ and $A_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Im}}$ which are sensitive
to the photon polarisation in this $q^2$ range, are found to be
$A_{\mathrm{T}}^{(2)} = -0.23 \pm 0.23 \pm 0.05$ and
$A_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Im}} =0.14 \pm 0.22 \pm 0.05$. The results are
consistent with Standard Model predictions.

Science as well as a challenge in Information Technologies where the current

generic mechanisms for management of connections in arrays consisting of first
order functional units. Functionals are higher order abstractions that are
useful for the management of such large arrays. Computations on higher order
objects comprise dynamic configuration of connections between first order
elementary functions in the arrays. Once the functionals are considered as the
generic mechanisms, they have a grounding in hardware. A conceptual framework
for constructing such mechanisms is presented, and their hardware realization
is discussed.

rigorous perturbation scheme to solve the continuum mechanics equation that
deals with both displacement and displacement rate fields and accounts for the
dissipation in the bulk of the material. The perturbative solution of this
equation allows to go beyond the previously used quasi-static approximation and
obtain the dissipative force. This force does not suffer from the physical
inconsistencies of the latter approximation and depends on particle deformation

system environments, e.g. comets, and the surfaces and interiors of icy
satellites, however the structural factors governing their formation and
dissociation are poorly understood. We demonstrate the use of a high pressure
gas cell, combined with variable temperature cooling and time-resolved data
collection, to the in situ study of clathrate hydrates under conditions
relevant to solar system environments. Clathrates formed and processed within
the cell are monitored in situ using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction and
Raman spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction allows the formation of clathrate
hydrates to be observed as CO2 gas is applied to ice formed within the cell.
Complete conversion is obtained by annealing at temperatures just below the ice
melting point. A subsequent rise in the quantity of clathrate is observed as
the cell is thermally cycled. Four regions between 100-5000cm-1 are present in
the Raman spectra that carry features characteristic of both ice and clathrate
formation. This novel experimental arrangement is well suited to studying
clathrate hydrates over a range of temperature (80-500K) and pressure
(1-100bar) conditions and can be used with a variety of different gases and
starting aqueous compositions. We propose the increase in clathrate formation
observed during thermal cycling may be due to the formation of a quasi
liquid-like phase that forms at temperatures below the ice melting point, but
which allows easier formation of new clathrate cages, or the retention and
delocalisation of previously formed clathrate structures, possibly as amorphous
clathrate. The structural similarities between hexagonal ice, the quasi
liquid-like phase, and crystalline CO2 hydrate mean that differences in the
Raman spectrum are subtle; however, all features out to 5000cm-1 are diagnostic
of clathrate structure.

facing the networks and the Internet. Comparing with the other security
threats, botnet members have the ability to be directed and controlled via C&C
messages from the botmaster over common protocols such as IRC and HTTP, or even
over covert and unknown applications. As for IRC botnets, general security
instances like firewalls and IDSes do not provide by themselves a viable
solution to prevent them completely. These devices could not differentiate well
between the legitimate and malicious traffic of the IRC protocol. So, this
paper is proposing an IDS-based and multi-phase IRC botnet and botnet behavior
detection model based on C&C responses messages and malicious behaviors of the
IRC bots inside the network environment. The proposed model has been evaluated
on five network traffic traces from two different network environments (Virtual
network and DARPA 2000 Windows NT Attack Data Set). The results show that the
proposed model could detect all the infected IRC botnet member(s), state their
current status of attack, filter their malicious IRC messages, pass the other
normal IRC messages and detect the botnet behavior regardless of the botnet
communication protocol with very low false positive rate. The proposed model
has been compared with some of the existing and well-known approaches,
including BotHunter, BotSniffer and Rishi regarding botnet characteristics
taken in each approach. The comparison showed that the proposed model has made
a progress on the comparative models by not to rely on a certain time window or
specific bot signatures.

access protocol and receiver structure. Despite extensive studies, how to
characterize the maximum sum rate of the simplest version of random access,
Aloha, remains an open question. In this paper, a comprehensive study of the
sum rate performance of slotted Aloha networks is presented. By extending the
unified analytical framework proposed in [20], [21] from the classical
collision model to the capture model, the network steady-state point in
saturated conditions is derived as a function of the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold which determines a
fundamental tradeoff between the information encoding rate and the network
throughput. To maximize the sum rate, both the SINR threshold and backoff
parameters of nodes should be properly selected. Explicit expressions of the
maximum sum rate and the optimal setting are obtained, which show that similar
to the sum capacity of the multiple access channel, the maximum sum rate of
slotted Aloha also logarithmically increases with the mean received
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but the high-SNR slope is only $e^{-1}$. Effects
of backoff and power control on the sum rate performance of slotted Aloha
networks are further discussed, which shed important light on the practical
network design.

spectra consistent with other SNe II-L, while the rest have plateaus that can
be as short as 70d, unlike the 100d typically found in nearby galaxies. The
OGLE SNe are also brighter, and show that magnitude limited surveys find SNe
that are different than usually found in nearby galaxies. We discuss this

  specific stiffness",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The concept of topological sensitivity (TS) is extended to enable
simultaneous 3D reconstruction of fractures with unknown boundary condition and
characterization of their interface by way of elastic waves. Interactions
between the two surfaces of a fracture, due to e.g. presence of asperities,
fluid, or proppant, are described via the Schoenberg's linear slip model. The
proposed TS sensing platform is formulated in the frequency domain, and entails
point-wise interrogation of the subsurface volume by infinitesimal fissures
endowed with interfacial stiffness. For completeness, the featured elastic
polarization tensor - central to the TS formula - is mathematically described
in terms of the shear and normal specific stiffness (ks,kn) of a vanishing
fracture. Simulations demonstrate that, irrespective of the contact condition
between the faces of a hidden fracture, the TS (used as a waveform imaging
tool) is capable of reconstructing its geometry and identifying the normal
vector to the fracture surface without iterations. On the basis of such
geometrical information, it is further shown via asymptotic analysis --
assuming ""low frequency"" elastic-wave illumination, that by certain choices of
(ks,kn) characterizing the trial (infinitesimal) fracture, the ratio between
the shear and normal specific stiffness along the surface of a nearly-panar
(finite) fracture can be qualitatively identified. This, in turn, provides a
valuable insight into the interfacial condition of a fracture at virtually no
surcharge -- beyond the computational effort required for its imaging. The
proposed developments are integrated into a computational platform based on a
regularized boundary integral equation (BIE) method for 3D elastodynamics, and
illustrated via a set of numerical experiments.

democratic societies. There have been decades of debate on how those values
-and legal obligations- can be embedded into systems, preferably from the very
beginning of the design process.
  One important element in this endeavour are technical mechanisms, known as
privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Their effectiveness has been
demonstrated by researchers and in pilot implementations. However, apart from a
few exceptions, e.g., encryption became widely used, PETs have not become a
standard and widely used component in system design. Furthermore, for unfolding
their full benefit for privacy and data protection, PETs need to be rooted in a
data governance strategy to be applied in practice.
  This report contributes to bridging the gap between the legal framework and
the available technological implementation measures by providing an inventory
of existing approaches, privacy design strategies, and technical building
blocks of various degrees of maturity from research and development. Starting
from the privacy principles of the legislation, important elements are
presented as a first step towards a design process for privacy-friendly systems
and services. The report sketches a method to map legal obligations to design
strategies, which allow the system designer to select appropriate techniques
for implementing the identified privacy requirements. Furthermore, the report
reflects limitations of the approach. It concludes with recommendations on how
to overcome and mitigate these limits.

waves (GWs) directly for the first time this decade. The ultimate prize will be
joint observation of a compact binary merger in both gravitational and
electromagnetic channels. However, GW sky locations that are uncertain by
hundreds of square degrees will pose a challenge. I describe a real-time
detection pipeline and a rapid Bayesian parameter estimation code that will
make it possible to search promptly for optical counterparts in Advanced LIGO.
Having analyzed a comprehensive population of simulated GW sources, we describe
the sky localization accuracy that the GW detector network will achieve as each
detector comes online and progresses toward design sensitivity. Next, in
preparation for the optical search with the intermediate Palomar Transient
Factory (iPTF), we have developed a unique capability to detect optical
afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor (GBM). Its comparable error regions offer a close parallel to the
Advanced LIGO problem, but Fermi's unique access to MeV-GeV photons and its
near all-sky coverage may allow us to look at optical afterglows in a
relatively unexplored part of the GRB parameter space. We present the discovery
and broadband follow-up observations of eight GBM-iPTF afterglows. Two of the
bursts are at low redshift, are sub-luminous with respect to ""standard""
cosmological bursts, and have spectroscopically confirmed broad-line type Ic
supernovae. These two bursts are possibly consistent with mildly relativistic
shocks breaking out from the progenitor envelopes rather than the standard
mechanism of internal shocks within an ultra-relativistic jet. On a technical
level, the GBM-iPTF effort is a prototype for locating and observing optical
counterparts of GW events in Advanced LIGO with the Zwicky Transient Facility.
