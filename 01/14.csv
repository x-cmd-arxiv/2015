currents during the reheating era after inflation, and prior to the
establishing of the proton-electron plasma. We assume that the currents may be
described by second order causal hydrodynamics. The resulting theory is not
conformally invariant. The expansion of the Universe produces temperature
gradients which couple to the current and generally oppose Ohmic dissipation.
Although the effect is not strong, it suggests that the unfolding of
hydrodynamic instabilities in these models may follow a different pattern than
in first order theories, and even than in second order theories on non

abundance analysis for eight objects with iron abundances [Fe/H] < -2.0,
including five extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H] < -3.0) stars with two having
[Fe/H] < -3.5. Among these objects, three are newly discovered EMP stars, one
of which is confirmed for the first time with high-resolution spectral
observations. Three program stars are regarded as carbon-enhanced metal-poor
(CEMP) stars, including two stars with no enhancement in their neutron-capture
elements, which thus possibly belong to the class of CEMP-no stars; one of
these objects also exhibits significant enhancement in nitrogen, and is thus a
potential carbon and nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor star. The [X/Fe] ratios of
the sample stars generally agree with those reported in the literature for
other metal-poor stars in the same [Fe/H] range. We also compared the abundance
patterns of individual program stars with the average abundance pattern of
metal-poor stars, and find only one chemically peculiar object with abundances
of at least two elements (other than C and N) showing deviations larger than
0.5dex. The distribution of [Sr/Ba] versus [Ba/H] agrees that an additional
nucleosynthesis mechanism is needed aside from a single r-process. Two program
stars with extremely low abundances of Sr and Ba support the prospect that both
main and weak r-process may have operated during the early phase of Galactic
chemical evolution. The distribution of [C/N] shows that there are two groups
of carbon-normal giants with different degrees of mixing. However, it is
difficult to explain the observed behavior of the [C/N] of the
nitrogen-enhanced unevolved stars based on current data.

from a tetragonal to a collapsed tetragonal phase under applied pressure of
about $15~\mathrm{GPa}$. Surprisingly, the collapsed tetragonal phase hosts a
superconducting state with $T_c \sim 12~\mathrm{K}$, while the tetragonal phase
is a $T_c \leq 3.4~\mathrm{K}$ superconductor. We show that the key difference
between the previously known non-superconducting collapsed tetragonal phase in
AFe$_2$As$_2$ (A= Ba, Ca, Eu, Sr) and the superconducting collapsed tetragonal
phase in KFe$_2$As$_2$ is the qualitatively distinct electronic structure.
While the collapsed phase in the former compounds features only electron
pockets at the Brillouin zone boundary and no hole pockets are present in the
Brillouin zone center, the collapsed phase in KFe$_2$As$_2$ has almost nested
electron and hole pockets. Within a random phase approximation spin fluctuation
approach we calculate the superconducting order parameter in the collapsed
tetragonal phase. We propose that a Lifshitz transition associated with the
structural collapse changes the pairing symmetry from $d$-wave (tetragonal) to
$s_\pm$ (collapsed tetragonal). Our DFT+DMFT calculations show that effects of
correlations on the electronic structure of the collapsed tetragonal phase are
minimal. Finally, we argue that our results are compatible with a change of
sign of the Hall coefficient with pressure as observed experimentally.

accomplished through analysing imagerybased features. Relying solely on visual
cues for public surveillance video understanding is unreliable, since visual
observations obtained from public space CCTV video data are often not
sufficiently trustworthy and events of interest can be subtle. On the other
hand, non-visual data sources such as weather reports and traffic sensory
signals are readily accessible but are not explored jointly to complement
visual data for video content analysis and summarisation. In this paper, we
present a novel unsupervised framework to learn jointly from both visual and
independently-drawn non-visual data sources for discovering meaningful latent
structure of surveillance video data. In particular, we investigate ways to
cope with discrepant dimension and representation whist associating these
heterogeneous data sources, and derive effective mechanism to tolerate with
missing and incomplete data from different sources. We show that the proposed
multi-source learning framework not only achieves better video content
clustering than state-of-the-art methods, but also is capable of accurately
inferring missing non-visual semantics from previously unseen videos. In
addition, a comprehensive user study is conducted to validate the quality of
video summarisation generated using the proposed multi-source model.

locally test the validity of the equilibrium assumptions in galaxy clusters.
Methods. We used a newly developed reconstruction method, based on
Richardson-Lucy deprojection, that allows reconstructing projected
gravitational potentials of galaxy clusters directly from X-ray observations.
We applied this algorithm to the well-studied cluster Abell 1689 and compared
the gravitational potential reconstructed from X-ray observables to the
potential obtained from gravitational lensing measurements. [...] Results.
Assuming spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium, the potentials
recovered from gravitational lensing and from X-ray emission agree very well
beyond 500 kpc. Owing to the fact that the Richardson-Lucy deprojection
algorithm allows deprojecting each line of sight independently, this result may
indicate that non-gravitational effects and/or asphericity are strong in the
central regions of the clusters. Conclusions. We demonstrate the robustness of
the potential reconstruction method based on the Richardson-Lucy deprojection
algorithm and show that gravitational lensing and X-ray emission lead to
consistent gravitational potentials. Our results illustrate the power of
combining galaxy-cluster observables in a single, non-parametric, joint
reconstruction of consistent cluster potentials that can be used to locally
constrain the physical state of the gas.

shown that, quite generally, galaxy properties depend intimately upon their
environment, most prominently when galaxies in clusters are compared to those
in the field. For galaxies in loose groups such as the LG, however,
environmental effects have been less clear. We consider the galaxy's
environmental density in spheres of 1200 kpc (comoving) and find that whilst

trend with star formation rates. This enhancement in star formation occurs
systematically for galaxies in higher density environments, regardless whether

richer environment at Mpc-scales may help replenish the star-forming gas,

vital factor that impacts clustering performance is how to learn or design the
data representation (or features). Fortunately, recent advances in deep
learning can learn unsupervised features effectively, and have yielded state of
the art performance in many classification problems, such as character
recognition, object recognition and document categorization. However, little
attention has been paid to the potential of deep learning for unsupervised
clustering problems. In this paper, we propose a deep belief network with
nonparametric clustering. As an unsupervised method, our model first leverages
the advantages of deep learning for feature representation and dimension
reduction. Then, it performs nonparametric clustering under a maximum margin
framework -- a discriminative clustering model and can be trained online
efficiently in the code space. Lastly model parameters are refined in the deep
belief network. Thus, this model can learn features for clustering and infer
model complexity in an unified framework. The experimental results show the
advantage of our approach over competitive baselines.

even-even nuclei it might be possible for two neutrons to simultaneously decay
into two protons and two electrons without emitting neutrinos. This is possible
only if neutrinos are Majorana particles, i.e. fermions that are their own
antiparticles. Neutrinos being Majorana particles would explicitly violate
lepton number conservation, and might play a role in the matter-antimatter
asymmetry in the universe. The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay
would also provide complementary information related to neutrino masses. The

decay of 76Ge and to demonstrate a background rate at or below 3

presented in clutter. The input to our algorithm is a point cloud and the
geometric parameters of the robot hand. The output is a set of hand
configurations that are expected to be good grasps. Our key idea is to use
knowledge of the geometry of a good grasp to improve detection. First, we use a
geometrically necessary condition to sample a large set of high quality grasp
hypotheses. We were surprised to find that using simple geometric conditions
for detection can result in a relatively high grasp success rate. Second, we
use the notion of an antipodal grasp (a standard characterization of a good two
fingered grasp) to help us classify these grasp hypotheses. In particular, we
generate a large automatically labeled training set that gives us high
classification accuracy. Overall, our method achieves an average grasp success
rate of 88% when grasping novels objects presented in isolation and an average
success rate of 73% when grasping novel objects presented in dense clutter.

question of the lifetime of the solar protoplanetary disc, the different stages
of planet formation, their duration, and their relative importance. We consider
whether meteorite evidence and observations of protoplanetary discs point in
the same direction. This will tell us whether our solar system had a typical
formation history or an exceptional one. There are also many indications that
the solar system formed as part of a star cluster. Here we examine the types of
cluster the Sun could have formed in, especially whether its stellar density
was at any stage high enough to influence the properties of today's solar
system. The likelihood of identifying siblings of the Sun is discussed.
Finally, the possible dynamical evolution of the solar system since its
formation and its future are considered.

through the breaking of the junctions between the two contacting surfaces.
Typically, interactions between the junctions through the bulk lead to rupture
fronts propagating from weak and/or highly stressed regions, whose junctions
break first. Experiments find rupture fronts ranging from quasi-static fronts
with speeds proportional to external loading rates, via fronts much slower than
the Rayleigh wave speed, and fronts that propagate near the Rayleigh wave
speed, to fronts that travel faster than the shear wave speed. The mechanisms
behind and selection between these fronts are still imperfectly understood.
Here we perform simulations in an elastic 2D spring--block model where the
frictional interaction between each interfacial block and the substrate arises
from a set of junctions modeled explicitly. We find that a proportionality
between material slip speed and rupture front speed, previously reported for
slow fronts, actually holds across the full range of front speeds we observe.
We revisit a mechanism for slow slip in the model and demonstrate that fast
slip and fast fronts have a different, inertial origin. We highlight the long
transients in front speed even in homogeneous interfaces, and we study how both
the local shear to normal stress ratio and the local strength are involved in
the selection of front type and front speed. Lastly, we introduce an
experimentally accessible integrated measure of block slip history, the Gini
coefficient, and demonstrate that in the model it is a good predictor of the
history-dependent local static friction coefficient of the interface. These
results will contribute both to building a physically-based classification of
the various types of fronts and to identifying the important mechanisms
involved in the selection of their propagation speed.

post-merger galaxies are presented, from a combination of matches to the

thresholds identical to that of the ALFALFA survey, and by compiling a mass-,
redshift- and environment-matched control sample from the public ALFALFA.40
data release, we calculate gas fraction offsets (Delta f_gas) for the
post-mergers, relative to the control sample. We find that the post-mergers
have HI gas fractions that are consistent with undisturbed galaxies. However,
due to the relative gas richness of the ALFALFA.40 sample, from which we draw
our control sample, our measurements of gas fraction enhancements are likely to
be conservative lower limits. Combined with comparable gas fraction
measurements by Fertig et al. in a sample of galaxy pairs, who also determine
gas fraction offsets consistent with zero, we conclude that there is no
evidence for significant neutral gas consumption throughout the merger
sequence. From a suite of 75 binary merger simulations we confirm that star
formation is expected to decrease the post-merger gas fraction by only 0.06
dex, even several Gyr after the merger. Moreover, in addition to the lack of
evidence for gas consumption from gas fraction offsets, the observed HI
detection fraction in the complete sample of post-mergers is twice as high as
the controls, which suggests that the post-merger gas fractions may actually be
enhanced. We demonstrate that a gas fraction enhancement in post-mergers,
relative to a stellar mass-matched control sample, would indeed be the natural
result of merging randomly drawn pairs from a parent population which exhibits
a declining gas fraction with increasing stellar mass.

full of moving objects, such as stars and dense clumps. These objects can enter

emitting properties of the downstream region of a standing shock formed due to
the interaction of a relativistic jet with an obstacle. We focus on the case of
red giants interacting with an extragalactic jet. We perform relativistic
axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of a relativistic jet meeting an
obstacle of very large inertia. The results are interpreted in the framework of
a red giant whose dense and slow wind interacts with the jet of an active
galactic nucleus. Assuming that particles are accelerated in the standing shock
generated in the jet as it impacts the red giant wind, we compute the
non-thermal particle distribution, the Doppler boosting enhancement, and the
non-thermal luminosity in gamma rays. The available non-thermal energy from
jet-obstacle interactions is potentially enhanced by a factor of $\sim 100$
when accounting for the whole surface of the shock induced by the obstacle,
instead of just the obstacle section. The observer gamma-ray luminosity,
including the flow velocity and Doppler boosting effects, can be ~300(g/10)^2
times higher than when the emitting flow is assumed at rest and only the
obstacle section is considered, where g is the jet Lorentz factor. For a whole
population of red giants inside the jet of an AGN, the predicted persistent
gamma-ray luminosities may be potentially detectable for a jet pointing to the
observer. Obstacles interacting with relativistic outflows, for instance clouds
and populations of stars for extragalactic jets, or stellar wind
inhomogeneities in microquasar jets and in winds of pulsars in binaries, should
be taken into account when investigating the non-thermal emission from these
sources.

modified gravity (MG) that is binned in redshift and scale, a parameterization
that evolves monotonically in scale but is binned in redshift, and a functional
parameterization that evolves only in redshift. We present the results in terms
of the MG parameters $Q$ and $\Sigma$. We employ an IA model with an amplitude
$A_{CFHTLenS}$ that is included in the parameter analysis. We find an
improvement in the constraints on the MG parameters corresponding to $40-53\%$
increase on the figure of merit compared to previous studies, and GR is found
consistent with the data at the $95\%$ CL. The bounds found on $A_{CFHTLenS}$
are sensitive to the MG parameterization used, and the correlations between
$A_{CFHTLenS}$ and MG parameters are found to be weak to moderate. For all 3 MG
parameterizations $A_{\rm CFHTLenS}$ is found consistent with zero when the
whole lensing sample is used, however, when using the optimized early-type
galaxy sample a significantly non-zero $A_{\rm CFHTLenS}$ is found for GR and
the third MG parameterization. We find that the tensions observed in previous
studies persist, and there is an indication that CMB data and lensing data
prefer different values for MG parameters, particularly for the parameter
$\Sigma$. The analysis of the confidence contours and probability distributions
suggest that the bimodality found follows that of the known tension in the
$\sigma_8$ parameter. (Abridged)

Search for the predicted 15Be 3/2+ state in the three-neutron decay channel. A
two-proton removal reaction from a 55 MeV/u 17C beam was used to populate
neutron-unbound states in 15Be. The two-, three-, and four-body decay energies
of the 12Be + neutron(s) detected in coincidence were reconstructed using
invariant mass spectroscopy. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to extract
the resonance and decay properties from the observed spectra. The low-energy
regions of the decay energy spectra can be described with the first excited
unbound state of 14Be (E_x=1.54 MeV, E_r=0.28 MeV). Including a state in 15Be
that decays through the first excited 14Be state slightly improves the fit at
higher energies though the cross section is small. A 15Be component is not
needed to describe the data. If the 3/2+ state in 15Be is populated, the decay
by three-neutron emission through 14Be is weak, less than or equal to 11% up to
4 MeV. In the best fit, 15Be is unbound with respect to 12Be by 1.4 MeV

Estimates of mortality rates represent a key information to assess the

manufacturing where survival analysis is routinely applied to estimate failure
rates, survival analysis has seldom been applied in fisheries stock assessment
despite similar purposes between these fields of applied statistics. In this
paper, we developed hazard functions to model the dynamic of an exploited fish
population. These functions were used to estimate all parameters necessary for
stock assessment (including natural and fishing mortality rates as well as gear
selectivity) by maximum likelihood using age data from a sample of catch. This
novel application of survival analysis to fisheries stock assessment was tested
by Monte Carlo simulations to assert that it provided un-biased estimations of
relevant quantities. The method was applied to data from the Queensland

First, younger EBs tend to reside in dustier environments with larger

modeling stellar populations. Second, younger EBs generally have large
eccentricities. This demonstrates that massive binaries at moderate orbital
periods are born with a Maxwellian ""thermal"" orbital velocity distribution,
which indicates they formed via dynamical interactions. In addition, the
age-eccentricity anticorrelation provides a direct constraint for tidal
evolution in highly eccentric binaries containing hot MS stars with radiative

three flavors of sleptons or squarks with minimum flavor violation. For Dirac
(Majorana) dark matter that annihilates via mediators charged as left-handed
sleptons, we find an upper bound around 45 TeV (7 TeV) for both the mediator
and dark matter masses, respectively. These bounds vary as the square root of
the number of colors times the number of flavors involved. Therefore the bounds
diminish by root two for right handed selectrons. The bounds increase by root
three and root six for right and left handed squarks, respectively. Finally,
because of the interest in natural models, we also focus on an effective field
theory with only stops. We find an upper bound around 32 TeV (5 TeV) for both
the Dirac (Majorana) dark matter and stop masses. In comparison to traditional
naturalness arguments, the stop bound gives a firmer, alternative expectation
on when new physics will appear. Similar to naturalness, all of the bounds
quoted above are valid outside of a defined fine-tuned regions where the dark
matter can co-annihilate. The bounds in this region of parameter space can
exceed the well-known bounds from Griest and Kamionkowski. We briefly describe
the impact on planned and existing direct detection experiments and colliders.

(Feedback in Realistic Environments) simulations. This suite of hydrodynamic
cosmological zoom simulations resolves formation of star-forming giant
molecular clouds to $z=0$, and features an explicit stellar feedback model on
small scales. Our simulations reveal that high redshift galaxies undergo bursts
of star formation followed by powerful gusts of galactic outflows that eject
much of the ISM and temporarily suppress star formation. At low redshift,
however, sufficiently massive galaxies corresponding to L*-progenitors develop
stable disks and switch into a continuous and quiescent mode of star formation
that does not drive outflows far into the halo. Mass-loading factors for winds
in L*-progenitors are $\eta \approx 10$ at high redshift, but decrease to $\eta
\ll 1$ at low redshift. Although lower values of $\eta$ are expected as halos
grow in mass over time, we show that the strong suppression of outflows with
decreasing redshift cannot be explained by mass evolution alone. Circumgalactic
outflow velocities are variable and broadly distributed, but typically range
between one and three times the circular velocity of the halo. Much of the
ejected material builds a reservoir of enriched gas within the circumgalactic
medium, some of which could be later recycled to fuel further star formation.
However, a fraction of the gas that leaves the virial radius through galactic
winds is never regained, causing most halos with mass $M_h \le 10^{12}
M_{\odot}$ to be deficient in baryons compared to the cosmic mean by $z=0$.

endeavors in particle physics. A particularly interesting way to perform this

currently completely unconstrained by all existing data. Recently, a novel
variable $\Theta$ was proposed for measuring the CP phase in the $h\tau\tau$
coupling through the $\tau^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0 \nu$ decay mode. We examine
two crucial questions that the real LHC detectors must face, namely, the issue
of neutrino reconstruction and the effects of finite detector resolution. For
the former, we find strong evidence that the collinear approximation is the
best for the $\Theta$ variable. For the latter, we find that the angular
resolution is actually not an issue even though the reconstruction of $\Theta$
requires resolving the highly collimated $\pi^\pm$'s and $\pi^0$'s from the
$\tau$ decays. Instead, we find that it is the missing transverse energy
resolution that significantly limits the LHC reach for measuring the CP phase
via $\Theta$. With the current missing energy resolution, we find that with
$\sim 1000\,\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ the CP phase hypotheses $\Delta = 0^\circ$ (the
standard model value) and $\Delta = 90^\circ$ can be distinguished, at most, at
the 95\% confidence level.

every accessible star brighter than mV=16.5, with brighter stars having
few-millimagnitude photometric precision in long-term light curves. It will be
capable of searching for transiting giant planets around the brightest and most
nearby stars, where the planets are much easier to characterize; it will also
search for small planets nearby M-dwarfs, for planetary occultations of white
dwarfs, and will perform comprehensive nearby microlensing and eclipse-timing
searches for exoplanets inaccessible to other planet-finding methods. The
Evryscope will also monitor outbursting young stars, white dwarf activity, and
stellar activity of all types, along with finding a large sample of
very-long-period M-dwarf eclipsing binaries. When relatively rare transients
events occur, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), nearby supernovae, or even
gravitational wave detections, the array will return minute-by-minute light
curves without needing pointing towards the event as it occurs. (abridged)

whether UCDs should be considered galactic in origin, or simply the most
extreme GCs, is not yet settled. We present the dynamical properties of 97
spectroscopically confirmed UCDs (rh >~10 pc) and 911 GCs associated with
central cD galaxy of the Virgo cluster, M87. Our UCDs, of which 89% have M_star
> ~2X10^6 M_sun and 92% are as blue as the classic blue GCs, nearly triple the
sample of previous confirmed Virgo UCDs, providing by far the best opportunity
for studying the global dynamics of a UCD system. We found that (1) UCDs have a
surface number density profile that is shallower than that of the blue GCs in
the inner ~ 70 kpc and as steep as that of the red GCs at larger radii; (2)
UCDs exhibit a significantly stronger rotation than the GCs, and the blue GCs
seem to have a velocity field that is more consistent with that of the
surrounding dwarf ellipticals than with that of UCDs; (3) UCDs have a radially
increasing orbital anisotropy profile, and are tangentially-biased at radii < ~
40 kpc and radially-biased further out. In contrast, the blue GCs become more
tangentially-biased at larger radii beyond ~ 40 kpc; (4) GCs with M_star >
2X10^6 M_sun have rotational properties indistinguishable from the less massive
ones, suggesting that it is the size, instead of mass, that differentiates UCDs
from GCs as kinematically distinct populations. We conclude that most UCDs in
M87 are not consistent with being merely the most luminous and extended
examples of otherwise normal GCs. The radially-biased orbital structure of UCDs

importance of CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CCH, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CH$_3$CN, and HNCO differ
between the organic-poor MYSOs and hot cores, however. Furthermore, the
N-bearing molecules are generally concentrated toward the source centers, while
most O- and C-bearing molecules are present both in the center and in the
colder envelope. Gas-phase HNCO/CH$_3$OH ratios are tentatively correlated with
the ratios of NH$_3$ ice over CH$_3$OH ice in the same lines of sight, which is
consistent with new gas-grain model predictions.
  Hot cores are not required to form complex organic molecules, and source

turbulence might play a crucial role in core-collapse supernova explosions,
however the fidelity with which turbulence is simulated in these studies is
unclear. Especially considering that the accuracy of ILES for the regime of
interest in CCSN, weakly compressible and strongly anisotropic, has not been
systematically assessed before. In this paper we assess the accuracy of ILES
using numerical methods most commonly employed in computational astrophysics by
means of a number of local simulations of driven, weakly compressible,
anisotropic turbulence. We report a detailed analysis of the way in which the
turbulent cascade is influenced by the numerics. Our results suggest that
anisotropy and compressibility in CCSN turbulence have little effect on the
turbulent kinetic energy spectrum and a Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ scaling is
obtained in the inertial range. We find that, on the one hand, the kinetic
energy dissipation rate at large scales is correctly captured even at
relatively low resolutions, suggesting that very high effective Reynolds number
can be achieved at the largest scales of the simulation. On the other hand, the
dynamics at intermediate scales appears to be completely dominated by the
so-called bottleneck effect, \ie the pile up of kinetic energy close to the
dissipation range due to the partial suppression of the energy cascade by
numerical viscosity. An inertial range is not recovered until the point where
relatively high resolution $\sim 512^3$, which would be difficult to realize in
global simulations, is reached. We discuss the consequences for CCSN
simulations.

individual dark matter haloes from the Phoenix and the Aquarius Projects to
investigate systematics of assembly history of subhaloes in dark matter haloes
differing by a factor of $1000$ in the halo mass. We have found that real
progenitors which built up present day subhalo population are relatively more
abundant for high mass haloes, in contrast to previous studies claiming a
universal form independent of the host halo mass. That is mainly because of
repeated counting of the 're-accreted' (progenitors passed through and were
later re-accreted to the host more than once) and inclusion of the 'ejected'
progenitor population(progenitors were accreted to the host in the past but no
longer members at present day) in previous studies. The typical accretion time
for all progenitors vary strongly with the host halo mass, which is typical
about $z \sim 5$ for the galactic Aquarius and about $z \sim 3$ for the cluster
sized Phoenix haloes. Once these progenitors start to orbit their parent
haloes, they rapidly lose their original mass but not their identifiers, more
than $55$ ($50$) percent of them survive to present day for the
Phoenix(Aquarius) haloes. At given redshift, survival fraction of the accreted
subhalo is independent of the parent halo mass, whilst the mass-loss of the
subhalo is more efficient in high mass haloes. These systematics results in
similarity and difference in the subhalo population in dark matter haloes of
different masses at present day.

assumed that behavioral reports are distributed evenly between the two possible

Importantly, this also extends our results from discrimination tasks to
detection tasks and detect probabilities for which much empirical data is

choices assigned to the more likely option: CPs and DPs are smallest for p
equal to 0.5 and increase as p increases, i.e. as the data deviates from the

Generally, heavier galaxies (mass $\gtrsim 10^{11}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ ) host a
central SMBH while lighter show a central NSC. Intermediate mass hosts,
instead, contain both a NSC and a SMBH. One possible formation mechanisms of a
NSC relies on the dry-merger (migratory) scenario, in which globular clusters

the absence of NSCs in high-mass galaxies can be imputed to destruction of the

challenging because they reside in small galaxies at high redshift which will
be difficult to directly detect. In this paper, we suggest that intensity
mapping may be a promising method to study Pop III stars. Intensity mapping is
a technique proposed to measure large-scale fluctuations of galaxy line
emission in three dimensions without resolving individual sources. This
technique is well suited for observing many faint galaxies because it can
measure their cumulative emission even if they cannot be directly detected. We
focus on intensity mapping of He II recombination lines. These lines are much
stronger in Pop III stars than Pop II stars because the harder spectra of Pop
III stars are expected to produce many He II ionizing photons. Measuring the He
II 1640 \AA{} intensity mapping signal, along with the signals from other lines
such as Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and metal lines, could give constraints on the
initial mass function (IMF) and star formation rate density (SFRD) of Pop III
stars as a function of redshift. To demonstrate the feasibility of these
observations, we estimate the strength of the Pop III He II 1640 \AA{}
intensity mapping signal from $z=10-20$. We show that at $z\approx10$, the

instruments, one which cross-correlates He II 1640 \AA{} with CO(1-0) line
emission from galaxies and the other with 21 cm emission from the intergalactic

estimates were based on scaling relations that use low-frequency characteristic
timescales which have large intrinsic uncertainties. For stellar-mass black
holes, we know that the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (100-450
hertz) in the X-ray emission that occur in a 3:2 frequency ratio are stable and
scale in frequency inversely with black hole mass with a reasonably small
dispersion. The discovery of such stable oscillations thus potentially offers
an alternative and less ambiguous means of mass determination for
intermediate-mass black holes, but has hitherto not been realized. Here we

simulations are of critical importance. This issue is especially challenging
for CFD applications. A particular obstacle for uncertainty quantifications in
CFD problems is the large model discrepancies associated with the CFD models
used for uncertainty propagation. Neglecting or improperly representing the
model discrepancies leads to inaccurate and distorted uncertainty distribution
for the Quantities of Interest. High-fidelity models, being accurate yet
expensive, can accommodate only a small ensemble of simulations and thus lead
to large interpolation errors and/or sampling errors; low-fidelity models can
propagate a large ensemble, but can introduce large modeling errors. In this
work, we propose a multi-model strategy to account for the influences of model
discrepancies in uncertainty propagation and to reduce their impact on the
predictions. Specifically, we take advantage of CFD models of multiple
fidelities to estimate the model discrepancies associated with the
lower-fidelity model in the parameter space. A Gaussian process is adopted to
construct the model discrepancy function, and a Bayesian approach is used to
infer the discrepancies and corresponding uncertainties in the regions of the
parameter space where the high-fidelity simulations are not performed. The
proposed multi-model strategy combines information from models with different
fidelities and computational costs, and is of particular relevance for CFD
applications, where a hierarchy of models with a wide range of complexities
exists. Several examples of relevance to CFD applications are performed to
demonstrate the merits of the proposed strategy. Simulation results suggest
that, by combining low- and high-fidelity models, the proposed approach
produces better results than what either model can achieve individually.

particular, penalized regression with singular penalty functions is important
for sparse reconstruction algorithms. For large-scale problems, these
algorithms exhibit sharp phase transition boundaries where sparse retrieval
breaks down. Large optimization problems associated with sparse reconstruction
have been analyzed in the literature by setting up corresponding statistical
mechanical models at a finite temperature. Using replica method for mean field
approximation, and subsequently taking a zero temperature limit, this approach
reproduces the algorithmic phase transition boundaries. Unfortunately, the
replica trick and the non-trivial zero temperature limit obscure the underlying
reasons for the failure of a sparse reconstruction algorithm, and of penalized
regression methods, in general. In this paper, we employ the ``cavity method''
to give an alternative derivation of the mean field equations, working directly
in the zero-temperature limit. This derivation provides insight into the origin
of the different terms in the self-consistency conditions. The cavity method
naturally involves a quantity, the average local susceptibility, whose behavior
distinguishes different phases in this system. This susceptibility can be
generalized for analysis of a broader class of sparse reconstruction

devices to transfer data over multiple concurrent paths, and hence, utilizes
the network resources more effectively than does the traditional single-path
TCP. However, as a reliable protocol, MPTCP still needs to deliver data packets
(to the upper application) at the receiver in the same order they are
transmitted at the sender. The out-of-order packet problem becomes more severe
for MPTCP due to the heterogeneous nature of delay and bandwidth of each path.
In this paper, we propose the forward-delay-based packet scheduling (FDPS)
algorithm for MPTCP to address that problem. The main idea is that the sender
dispatches packets via concurrent paths according to their estimated forward
delay and throughput differences. Via simulations with various network
conditions, the results show that our algorithm significantly maintains
in-order arrival packets at the receiver compared with several previous
algorithms.

interesting consequences - both experimental and theoretical. Besides
predicting observable deviations from linear evolution, it implies that these
deviations must originate in nondeterministic effects at the elementary level
in order to prevent superluminal signaling, as demonstrated by Gisin. This lack
of determinism implies that information cannot be instantiated in a
reproducible form in isolated microsystems (as illustrated by the No-cloning
theorem). By stipulating that information is a reproducible and referential
property of physical systems, one can formulate the no-signaling principle in
strictly physical terms as a prohibition of the acquisition of information
about spacelike-separated occurrences. This formulation provides a new
perspective on the relationship between relativity and spacetime structure, and
it imposes tight constraints on the way in which collapse effects are induced.
These constraints indicate that wave function collapse results from (presumably
small) nondeterministic deviations from linear evolution associated with
nonlocally entangling interactions. This hypothesis can be formalized in a
stochastic collapse equation and used to assess the feasibility of testing for
collapse effects.

indistinguishability of states, measurement-uncertainty,
measurement-disturbance, complementarity, noncommutativity, interference, the
no-cloning theorem, and the collapse of the wave-packet) that do fall under its

can never admit a classical understanding -- the intrinsically quantum
mechanical aspects of Nature. The most famous of these is Bell's theorem, but
we also review two more recent results in this area. Firstly, Hardy's theorem
shows that even a finite dimensional quantum system must contain an infinite
amount of information, and secondly, the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph theorem shows
that the wave-function must be an objective property of an individual quantum

danger, but is susceptible to dysregulation. Anxiety disorders are prevalent at
high frequency in contemporary human societies, yet impose substantial
disability upon their sufferers. This raises a puzzle: why has evolution left
us vulnerable to anxiety disorders? We develop a signal detection model in
which individuals must learn how to calibrate their anxiety responses: they
need to learn which cues indicate danger in the environment. We derive the
optimal strategy for doing so, and find that individuals face an inevitable
exploration-exploitation tradeoff between obtaining a better estimate of the
level of risk on one hand, and maximizing current payoffs on the other. Because
of this tradeoff, a subset of the population can become trapped in a state of
self-perpetuating over-sensitivity to threatening stimuli, even when
individuals learn optimally. This phenomenon arises because when individuals
become too cautious, they stop sampling the environment and fail to correct
their misperceptions, whereas when individuals become too careless they
continue to sample the environment and soon discover their mistakes. Thus,
over-sensitivity to threats becomes common whereas under-sensitivity becomes
rare. We suggest that this process may be involved in the development of
excessive anxiety in humans.

determine their transport properties. In the Ginzburg-Landau theory, vortices
correspond to topological defects in the complex order parameter. Extracting
their precise positions and motion from discretized numerical simulation data
is an important, but challenging task. In the past, vortices have mostly been
detected by analyzing the magnitude of the complex scalar field representing
the order parameter and visualized by corresponding contour plots and
isosurfaces. However, these methods, primarily used for small-scale
simulations, blur the fine details of the vortices, scale poorly to large-scale
simulations, and do not easily enable isolating and tracking individual
vortices. Here we present a method for exactly finding the vortex core lines
from a complex order parameter field. With this method, vortices can be easily
described at a resolution even finer than the mesh itself. The precise
determination of the vortex cores allows the interplay of the vortices inside a
model superconductor to be visualized in higher resolution than has previously
been possible. By representing the field as the set of vortices, this method
also massively reduces the data footprint of the simulations and provides the

dictionary, if the number of measurements scales roughly with the sparsity
level. One sufficient condition for such is the $D$-restricted isometry
property ($D$-RIP), which asks that the sampling matrix approximately preserve
the norm of all signals which are sufficiently sparse in $D$. While many
classes of random matrices are known to satisfy such conditions, such matrices
are not representative of the structural constraints imposed by practical
sensing systems. We close this gap in the theory by demonstrating that one can
subsample a fixed orthogonal matrix in such a way that the $D$-RIP will hold,
provided this basis is sufficiently incoherent with the sparsifying dictionary
$D$. We also extend this analysis to allow for weighted sparse expansions.
Consequently, we arrive at compressive sensing recovery guarantees for
structured measurements and redundant dictionaries, opening the door to a wide
array of practical applications.

networking and microblogging platforms to enable users to start a topic
specific discussion or classify a post into a desired category. Segmenting and
linking the entities present within the hashtags could therefore help in better
understanding and extraction of information shared across the social media.
However, due to lack of space delimiters in the hashtags (e.g #nsavssnowden),
the segmentation of hashtags into constituent entities (""NSA"" and ""Edward
Snowden"" in this case) is not a trivial task. Most of the current
state-of-the-art social media analytics systems like Sentiment Analysis and
Entity Linking tend to either ignore hashtags, or treat them as a single word.
In this paper, we present a context aware approach to segment and link entities
in the hashtags to a knowledge base (KB) entry, based on the context within the
tweet. Our approach segments and links the entities in hashtags such that the
coherence between hashtag semantics and the tweet is maximized. To the best of
our knowledge, no existing study addresses the issue of linking entities in
hashtags for extracting semantic information. We evaluate our method on two
different datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in
improving the overall entity linking in tweets via additional semantic
information provided by segmenting and linking entities in a hashtag.

fragmentation, thus resolving the formation of individual protostellar cores. A
time- and location-dependent protostellar radiation field, which heats the gas
by absorption on dust, is computed by integration of protostellar evolutionary
tracks with the MESA code. The simulation also includes a robust
non-equilibrium chemical network that self-consistently treats gas
thermodynamics and dust-gas coupling. The system is evolved for 18 kyr after
the first protostellar source has formed. In this time span, 30 sink particles
representing protostellar cores form with a total mass of 81 Msun. Their masses
range from ~0.1 Msun to 14.4 Msun with a median mass ~0.5-1 Msun. Massive
protostars grow by competitive accretion while lower-mass protostars are
stunted in growth by close encounters and many-body ejections. In the regime
explored here, the characteristic mass scale is determined by the temperature
floor set by the cosmic microwave background and by the onset of efficient
dust-gas coupling. It seems unlikely that host galaxies of the first bursts of
metal-enriched star formation will be detectable with the James Webb Space
Telescope or other next-generation infrared observatories. Instead, the most
promising access route to the dawn of cosmic star formation may lie in the
scrutiny of metal-poor, ancient stellar populations in the Galactic

of the photon arrival rate. Lieu et al. (2015) provide a detailed
quantum-mechanical calculation of a proposed measurement scheme that uses two
detectors and conclude that this scheme avoids the sensitivity degradation that
is associated with photon bunching. If correct, this result could have a

the equivalence of these two approaches. These direct calculations are
furthermore shown to be consistent with an indirect argument based on a
correlation method that establishes an independent limit to the sensitivity of
shot-noise measurement schemes. Collectively, these results conclusively
demonstrate that the photon bunching sensitivity penalty applies to shot noise

independent Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with definite particle numbers
form interference fringes even though no fringes would be expected based on the
single-particle density [1-4]. By drawing random deviates from the $N$-particle
probability density single experimental shots can be simulated from first
principles [1, 3, 5]. However, obtaining expressions for the $N$-particle
probability density of realistic time-dependent many-body systems has so far
been elusive. Here, we show how single experimental shots of general ultracold

interference fringes in interacting independent BECs, fluctuations in the
collisions of strongly attractive BECs, the appearance of randomly fluctuating

biologists have several commonly-used models for RNA: words in a fixed alphabet
(representing the primary sequence of nucleotides) and plane trees
(representing the secondary structure, or folding of the RNA sequence). This
paper considers an augmented version of the standard model of plane trees, one
that incorporates some observed constraints on how the folding can occur. In
particular we assume the alphabet consists of complementary pairs, for instance
the Watson-Crick pairs A-U and C-G of RNA.
  Given a word in the alphabet, a valid plane tree is a tree for which, when
the word is folded around the tree, each edge matches two complementary
letters. Consider the graph whose vertices are valid plane trees for a fixed
word and whose edges are given by Condon, Heitsch, and Hoos's local moves. We
prove this graph is connected.
  We give an explicit algorithm to construct a valid plane tree from a primary
sequence, assuming that at least one valid plane tree exists. The tree produced
by our algorithm has other useful characterizations, including a uniqueness
condition defined by local moves. We also study enumerative properties of valid
plane trees, analyzing how the number of valid plane trees depends on the
choice of sequence length and alphabet size. Finally we show that the
proportion of words with at least one valid plane tree goes to zero as the word
size increases. We also give some open questions.

optimization problems: given a set $P$ of points, and a set $\mathcal{D}$ of
geometric objects in the plane, the goal is to compute a small-sized subset of
$P$ that hits all objects in $\mathcal{D}$. In 1994, Bronniman and Goodrich
made an important connection of this problem to the size of fundamental
combinatorial structures called $\epsilon$-nets, showing that small-sized
$\epsilon$-nets imply approximation algorithms with correspondingly small
approximation ratios. Very recently, Agarwal and Pan showed that their scheme
can be implemented in near-linear time for disks in the plane. Altogether this
gives $O(1)$-factor approximation algorithms in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time for hitting
sets for disks in the plane.
  This constant factor depends on the sizes of $\epsilon$-nets for disks;
unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art bounds are large -- at least
$24/\epsilon$ and most likely larger than $40/\epsilon$. Thus the approximation
factor of the Agarwal and Pan algorithm ends up being more than $40$. The best
lower-bound is $2/\epsilon$, which follows from the Pach-Woeginger construction
for halfspaces in two dimensions. Thus there is a large gap between the
best-known upper and lower bounds. Besides being of independent interest,
finding precise bounds is important since this immediately implies an improved
linear-time algorithm for the hitting-set problem.
  The main goal of this paper is to improve the upper-bound to $13.4/\epsilon$
for disks in the plane. The proof is constructive, giving a simple algorithm
that uses only Delaunay triangulations. We have implemented the algorithm,
which is available as a public open-source module. Experimental results show
that the sizes of $\epsilon$-nets for a variety of data-sets is lower, around
$9/\epsilon$.

maximum value). Though self-gravitating, this volume of gas, however, is not
seen to be in free-fall. This post-collapse filament then fragments along its
length due to the growth of a Jeans-like instability to form prestellar cores
like \emph{beads on a string}. We suggest, dense filaments in typical
star-forming clouds classified as gravitationally super-critical under the
assumption of : (i) isothermality when in fact, they are not, and (ii) extended
radial profiles as against one that is pressure-truncated, thereby causing
significant over-estimation of their mass line-density, are unlikely to
experience gravitational free-fall. The radial density and temperature profile
derived for this post-collapse filament is consistent with that deduced for
typical filamentary clouds mapped in recent surveys of nearby star-forming
regions.

""Supersoft"" models, with $D$-type supersymmetry breaking and heavy Dirac
gauginos, are considerably less constrained by the LHC searches than the well
studied MSSM. These models also ameliorate the supersymmetric flavor and $CP$
problems. However, previously considered mechanisms for obtaining a natural
size Higgsino mass parameter (namely, $\mu$) in supersoft models have been
relatively complicated and contrived. Obtaining a $125\gev$ for the mass of the
lightest Higgs boson has also been difficult. Additional issues with the
supersoft scenario arise from the fact that these models contain new scalars in
the adjoint representation of the standard model, which may obtain negative
squared-masses, breaking color and generating too large a $T$-parameter. In
this work we introduce new operators into supersoft models which can
potentially solve all these issues. A novel feature of this framework is that
the new $\mu$-term can give unequal masses to the up and down type Higgs
fields, and the Higgsinos can be much heavier than the Higgs boson without
fine-tuning. However, unequal Higgs and Higgsino masses also remove some
attractive features of supersoft susy.

UV radiation from the protostar are important feedback processes. Our aim is to
quantify the feedback, mechanical and radiative, for a large sample of low-mass
sources. The outflow activity is compared to radiative feedback in the form of
UV heating by the accreting protostar to search for correlations and
evolutionary trends. Large-scale maps of 26 young stellar objects, which are
part of the Herschel WISH key program are obtained using the CHAMP+ instrument
on the APEX (12CO and 13CO 6-5), and the HARP-B instrument on the JCMT (12CO
and 13CO 3-2). Maps are used to determine outflow parameters and envelope
models are used to quantify the amount of UV-heated gas and its temperature
from 13CO 6-5 observations. All sources in our sample show outflow activity and
the outflow force, F_CO, is larger for Class 0 sources than for Class I
sources, even if their luminosities are comparable. The outflowing gas
typically extends to much greater distances than the power-law envelope and
therefore influences the surrounding cloud material directly. Comparison of the
CO 6-5 results with Herschel-HIFI H2O and PACS high-J CO lines, both tracing
currently shocked gas, shows that the two components are linked, even though
the transitions do not probe the same gas. The link does not extend down to CO
3-2. The conclusion is that CO 6-5 depends on the shock characteristics
(density and velocity), whereas CO 3-2 is more sensitive to conditions in the
surrounding environment (density). The radiative feedback is responsible for
increasing the gas temperature by a factor of two, up to 30-50 K, on scales of
a few thousand AU, particularly along the direction of the outflow. The mass of
the UV heated gas exceeds the mass contained in the entrained outflow in the
inner ~3000 AU and is therefore at least as important on small scales.

memoir ""On curves defined by a differential equation"" in 1882. From the point
of view of physics, a stable limit cycle (or attractive) is the representation
of the periodic solution of a (mechanical or electrical) dissipative system
whose oscillations are maintained by the system itself. Conversely, the
existence of a stable limit cycle ensures the maintenance of the oscillations.
So far, the historiography considered that the Russian mathematician Aleksandr
Andronov was the first to establish such a correspondence between the periodic
solution of a self-oscillating system and Poincar\'e's concept of limit cycle.
The recent discovery of a series of lectures given by Henri Poincar\'e in 1908
at the School of Post and Telegraph (now Telecom Paris Tech) proves that he had
already used his limit cycle concept to establish the existence of a regime of
maintained waves in a wireless device of radiotechnics. This article aims on
the one hand to trace the emergence of this concept since its creation by
Poincar\'e and the other hand to highlight its importance and role in the

source rather than a typical plane-wave beam excitation, thus providing an
effective analogue of the fluorescent dye or nanoparticle coatings used in

the surface or inside a microsphere, serves to assess the relative efficiency
of nearby radiating TE and TM modes, characterizing the profile of the
spectrum. By varying the number, positions and alignments of the dipole
sources, different excitation scenarios can be compared to analytic models, and
to experimental results. The energy flux is collected via a nearby disk-shaped
region. The resultant spectral profile shows a dependence on the configuration
of the dipole sources. The power outcoupling can then be optimized for specific
modes and wavelength regions. The development of such a computational tool can
aid the preparation of optical sensors prior to fabrication, by preselecting

  Accepted August 17, 2015",,,,"stat.ML stat.CO stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Our paper deals with inferring simulator-based statistical models given some
observed data. A simulator-based model is a parametrized mechanism which
specifies how data are generated. It is thus also referred to as generative
model. We assume that only a finite number of parameters are of interest and
allow the generative process to be very general; it may be a noisy nonlinear
dynamical system with an unrestricted number of hidden variables. This weak
assumption is useful for devising realistic models but it renders statistical
inference very difficult. The main challenge is the intractability of the
likelihood function. Several likelihood-free inference methods have been
proposed which share the basic idea of identifying the parameters by finding
values for which the discrepancy between simulated and observed data is small.
A major obstacle to using these methods is their computational cost. The cost
is largely due to the need to repeatedly simulate data sets and the lack of
knowledge about how the parameters affect the discrepancy. We propose a
strategy which combines probabilistic modeling of the discrepancy with
optimization to facilitate likelihood-free inference. The strategy is
implemented using Bayesian optimization and is shown to accelerate the
inference through a reduction in the number of required simulations by several
orders of magnitude.

derived holds even in the case of arbitrary linear and angular speed. This
solution is obtained by deriving the analytical expression of any-order moment
of the probability distribution. To the best of our knowledge, an analytical
expression for any-order moment that holds even in the case of arbitrary linear
and angular speed, has never been derived before. To compute these moments, a
direct integration of the Langevin equation is carried out and each moment is
expressed as a multiple integral of the deterministic motion (i.e., the known
motion that would result in absence of noise). For the special case when the
ratio between the linear and angular speed is constant, the multiple integrals
can be easily solved and expressed as the real or the imaginary part of
suitable analytic functions. As an application of the derived analytical
results, the paper investigates the diffusivity of the considered Brownian
motion for constant and for arbitrary time-dependent linear and angular speed.

size, to the Earth. It was first detected with NASA's \emph{Kepler} spacecraft
and then characterised in more detail using radial velocity follow-up
observations. Not only is its size very similar to that of the Earth ($1.2
R_\oplus$), it also has a very similar density ($5.6$ g cm$^{-2}$). What makes
this planet particularly interesting is that it orbits its host star every
$8.5$ hours, giving it an orbital distance of only $0.0089$ au. What we
investigate here is whether or not such a planet could have been perturbed into
this orbit by an outer companion on an inclined orbit. In this scenario, the
outer perturber causes the inner orbit to undergo Kozai-Lidov cycles which, if
the periapse comes sufficiently close to the host star, can then lead to the
planet being tidally circularised into a close orbit. We find that this process
can indeed produce such very-close-in planets within the age of the host star
($\sim 600 - 900$ Myr), but it is more likely to find such ultra-short-period
planets around slightly older stars ($> 1$ Gyr). However, given the size of the
Kepler sample and the likely binarity, our results suggest that Kepler-78b may
indeed have been perturbed into its current orbit by an outer stellar
companion. The likelihood of this happening, however, is low enough that other
processes - such as planet-planet scattering - could also be responsible.

non-recycled pulsars and four millisecond pulsars, observed below 200 MHz with
the LOFAR high-band antennas. Based on the observed profiles, we perform an
initial investigation of expected observational effects resulting from the
propagation of polarised emission in the pulsar magnetosphere and the
interstellar medium.
  The predictions of magnetospheric birefringence in pulsars have been tested
using spectra of the pulse width and fractional polarisation from
multifrequency data. The derived spectra offer only partial support for the
expected effects of birefringence on the polarisation properties, with only
about half of our sample being consistent with the model's predictions. It is
noted that for some pulsars these measurements are contaminated by the effects
of interstellar scattering. For a number of pulsars in our sample, we have
observed significant variations in the amount of Faraday rotation as a function
of pulse phase, which is possibly an artefact of scattering. These variations
are typically two orders of magnitude smaller than that observed at 1400 MHz by
Noutsos et al. (2009), for a different sample of southern pulsars. In this
paper we present a possible explanation for the difference in magnitude of this
effect between the two frequencies, based on scattering. Finally, we have
estimated the magnetospheric emission heights of low-frequency radiation from
four pulsars, based on the phase lags between the flux-density and the PA
profiles, and the theoretical framework of Blaskiewicz, Cordes & Wasserman
(1991). These estimates yielded heights of a few hundred km; at least for PSR
B1133+16, this is consistent with emission heights derived based on
radius-to-frequency mapping, but is up to a few times larger than the recent
upper limit based on pulsar timing.

and the convectional $2\pi$ period Josephson effect in the insulator junction
induces a double-well potential energy landscape in the SQUID. As a result, the
two lowest energy levels of the SQUID are isolated from other levels. These two
levels show contradicting circulating supercurrents, thus can be used as a flux

large numbers. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to couple this flux qubit with
the Majorana qubit by tuning the junction parameters, and how to use this

preservation of vascular structures in maximum intensity projected (MIP)

anisotropic diffusion which allows us to simultaneously reduce the noise and
enhance vascular structures reconstructed using both M/mIP angiograms. This
method is based on spatial adaptation of the diffusion function, separately in
the directions of the gradient, and along those of the minimum and maximum
curvatures. The existing approach of directional anisotropic diffusion uses
binary switched diffusion function to ensure diffusion along the direction of
maximum curvature stopped near the vessel borders. Here, the choice of a
threshold for detecting the upper limit of diffusion becomes difficult in the
presence of spatially varying baseline. Also, the approach of using vesselness
measure to steer the diffusion process results in structural discontinuities
due to junction suppression in mIP. The merits of the proposed method include
elimination of the need for an apriori choice of a threshold to detect the
vessel, and problems due to junction suppression. The proposed method is also

is a general feature when the initial state is entangled, while for those in a

based on prior Gaussian fields with uncertainty in the covariance function

the Karhunen-\Loeve expansion of a prior Gaussian process assuming covariance
function with fixed hyper-parameters, despite the fact that these are uncertain
in nature. The posterior distribution of the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve coordinates is
then inferred using available observations. The resulting inferred field is
therefore dependent on the assumed hyper-parameters. Here, we seek to
efficiently estimate both the field and covariance hyper-parameters using
Bayesian inference. To this end, a generalized Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion is
derived using a coordinate transformation to account for the dependence with
respect to the covariance hyper-parameters. Polynomial Chaos expansions are
employed for the acceleration of the Bayesian inference using similar
coordinate transformations, enabling us to avoid expanding explicitly the
solution dependence on the uncertain hyper-parameters. We demonstrate the
feasibility of the proposed method on a transient diffusion equation by
inferring spatially-varying log-diffusivity fields from noisy data. The
inferred profiles were found closer to the true profiles when including the
hyper-parameters' uncertainty in the inference formulation.

unidentified? Are they just blazars in disguise or they are something more
exotic, possibly associated with dark matter? How would they fit in the
radio-gamma ray connection studied so far?
  With their superb sensitivity, SKA1-MID and SKA1-SUR will help to resolve all
of these questions. Even more, while the radio-MeV/GeV connection has been
firmly established, a radio-VHE connection has been entirely elusive so far.
The advent of CTA in the next few years and the expected CTA-SKA1 synergy will

of particles up to the highest energies.

positional coincidence is not significant enough for selecting counterparts and
we need an additional physical criterion to pinpoint the right object. It can
be radio spectral index, variability, polarization, or compactness, needing
high angular resolution in SKA1-MID; timing studies can also reveal pulsars,
which are often found from dedicated searches of unidentified gamma-ray
sources. SKA will be the ideal instrument for investigating these
characteristics in conjunction with CTA.

curvature lower bound conditions for metric measure spaces. The goal of this
paper is to understand which structural properties such assumption (or even
weaker modifications) implies on the measure, on its support and on the
geodesics of the space. We start our investigation from the euclidean case by
proving that if a positive Radon measure $\mathsf{m}$ over $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
such that $(\mathbb{R}^{d},|\cdot |, \mathsf{m})$ verifies a weaker variant of
$\mathsf{MCP}$, then its support $\text{spt}(\mathsf{m})$ must be convex and
$\mathsf{m}$ has to be absolutely continuous with respect to the relevant
Hausdorff measure of $\text{spt}(\mathsf{m})$. This result is then used as a
starting point to investigate the rigidity of $\mathsf{MCP}$ in the metric
framework. We introduce the new notion of $reference \ measure$ for a metric
space and prove that if $(X,\mathsf{d},\mathsf{m})$ is essentially
non-branching and verifies $\mathsf{MCP}$, and $\mu$ is an essentially
non-branching $\mathsf{MCP}$ reference measure for $(\text{spt}(\mathsf{m}),
\mathsf{d})$, then $\mathsf{m}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$,
on the set of points where an inversion plan exists. As a consequence, an
essentially non-branching $\mathsf{MCP}$ reference measure enjoys a weak type
of uniqueness, up to densities. We also prove a stability property for
reference measures under measured Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, provided an
additional uniform bound holds. In the final part we present concrete examples

  Deepest Descent Strategy",,,,,"math.OC cs.MS math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An algorithm and associated strategy for solving polynomial systems within
the optimization framework is presented. The algorithm and strategy are named,
respectively, the penetrating gradient algorithm and the deepest descent
strategy. The most prominent feature of penetrating gradient algorithm, after
which it was named, is its ability to see and penetrate through the obstacles
in error space along the line of search direction and to jump to the global
minimizer in a single step. The ability to find the deepest point in an
arbitrary direction, no matter how distant the point is and regardless of the
relief of error space between the current and the best point, motivates
movements in directions in which cost function can be maximally reduced, rather
than in directions that seem to be the best locally (like, for instance, the
steepest descent, i.e., negative gradient direction). Therefore, the strategy
is named the deepest descent, in contrast but alluding to the steepest descent.
Penetrating gradient algorithm is derived and its properties are proven
mathematically, while features of the deepest descent strategy are shown by
comparative simulations. Extensive benchmark tests confirm that the proposed
algorithm and strategy jointly form an effective solver of polynomial systems.
In addition, further theoretical considerations in Section 5 about solving
linear systems by the proposed method reveal a surprising and interesting
relation of proposed and Gauss-Seidel method.

selection using both SCUSS and SDSS data, based on considerations of the deep
SCUSS $u$-band imaging and two-epoch $u$-band variability. We find that the
combination of the SCUSS $u$-band and the SDSS $griz$ band allows us to select
more faint quasars and more quasars at redshift around 2.2 than the selection
only with the SDSS $ugriz$ data. Quasars have significant $u$-band
variabilities. The fraction of quasars with large two-epoch variability is much
higher than that of stars. The selection by variability can select both
low-redshift quasars with ultraviolet excess and mid-redshift ($2 < z <3.5$)
quasars where quasar selection by optical colors is inefficient. The above two
selections are complementary and make full use of the SCUSS u-band advantages.

underlies existing rule-based privacy research. In terms of automation, we
identify the major reasoning tasks for privacy cases such as deducing legal

and Janssen (2009) models coupled with Adler-Taylor (2009) theory on the Euler
characteristics of random fields. Extreme statistics of the Andrea rogue wave
event are examined capitalizing on European Reanalysis (ERA)-interim data. A
refinement of Janssen's (2003) theory suggests that in realistic oceanic seas
characterized by short-crested multidirectional waves, homogeneous and Gaussian
initial conditions become irrelevant as the wave field adjusts to a
non-Gaussian state dominated by bound nonlinearities over time scales $t\gg
t_{c}\approx0.13T_{0}/\nu\sigma_{\theta}$, where $T_{0}$, $\nu$ and
$\sigma_{\theta}$ denote mean wave period, spectral bandwidth and angular
spreading of dominant waves. For the Andrea storm, ERA-interim predictions
yield $t_{c}/T_{0}\sim O(1)$ indicating that quasi-resonant interactions are
negligible. Further, the mean maximum sea surface height expected over the
Ekofisk platform's area is higher than that expected at a fixed point. However,
both of these statistics underestimate the actual crest height
$h_{obs}\sim1.63H_s$ observed at a point near the Ekofisk site, where $H_s$ is
the significant wave height. To explain the nature of such extreme, we account
for both skewness and kurtosis effects and consider the threshold $h_{q}$
exceeded with probability $q$ by the maximum surface height of a sea state over
an area in time. We find that $h_{obs}$ nearly coincides with the threshold
$h_{1/1000}\sim1.62H_s$ estimated at a point for a typical $3$-hour sea state,
suggesting that the Andrea rogue wave is likely to be a rare occurrence in
quasi-Gaussian seas.

catalog provides the first chance to spectroscopically probe the volume of the
Granett et al. (2008) supervoid catalog that constitutes the only set of voids
which has shown a significant detection of a cross-correlation signal between
void locations and average CMB chill. We found that the positions of voids
identified in the spectroscopic DR10 galaxy catalog typically do not coincide
with the locations of the Granett et al. supervoids in the overlapping volume,
in spite of the presence of large underdense regions of high void-density in
DR10. This failure to locate the same structures with spectroscopic redshifts
may arise due to systematic differences in the properties of voids detected in
photometric and spectroscopic samples. In the stacking measurement, we first
find a $\Delta T = - 11.5 \pm 3.7~\mu K$ imprint for 35 of the 50 Granett et
al. supervoids available in the DR10 volume. For the DR10 void catalog, lacking
a prior on the number of voids to be considered in the stacking analysis, we
find that the correlation measurement is fully consistent with no correlation.
However, the measurement peaks with amplitude $\Delta T = - 9.8 \pm 4.8~\mu K$
for the a posteriori-selected 44 largest voids of size $R>65~Mpc/h$ that does
match in terms of amplitude and number of structures the Granett et al.
observation, although at different void positions.

sophisticated strategies to evade detection and take overs, and to monetize
their infrastructure. At the same time, the success of privacy infrastructures
such as Tor opened the door to illegal activities, including botnets,
ransomware, and a marketplace for drugs and contraband. We contend that the
next waves of botnets will extensively subvert privacy infrastructure and
cryptographic mechanisms. In this work we propose to preemptively investigate
the design and mitigation of such botnets. We first, introduce OnionBots, what
we believe will be the next generation of resilient, stealthy botnets.
OnionBots use privacy infrastructures for cyber attacks by completely
decoupling their operation from the infected host IP address and by carrying
traffic that does not leak information about its source, destination, and
nature. Such bots live symbiotically within the privacy infrastructures to
evade detection, measurement, scale estimation, observation, and in general all
IP-based current mitigation techniques. Furthermore, we show that with an
adequate self-healing network maintenance scheme, that is simple to implement,
OnionBots achieve a low diameter and a low degree and are robust to
partitioning under node deletions. We developed a mitigation technique, called
SOAP, that neutralizes the nodes of the basic OnionBots. We also outline and
discuss a set of techniques that can enable subsequent waves of Super
OnionBots. In light of the potential of such botnets, we believe that the
research community should proactively develop detection and mitigation methods
to thwart OnionBots, potentially making adjustments to privacy infrastructure.

due to the increasingly challenging nature of numerical integrals that are now

order $\alpha$, an optimal QMC rule converges at a best-possible rate
$O(N^{-\alpha/d})$. However, in applications the value of $\alpha$ can be
unknown and/or a rate-optimal QMC rule can be unavailable. Standard practice is
to employ $\alpha_L$-optimal QMC where the lower bound $\alpha_L \leq \alpha$
is known, but in general this does not exploit the full power of QMC. One
solution is to trade-off numerical integration with functional approximation.
This strategy is explored herein and shown to be well-suited to modern
statistical computation. A challenging application to robotic arm data
demonstrates a substantial variance reduction in predictions for mechanical

around a crack tip requires selecting an auxiliary field and a material
variation field. We formulate a family of these fields accounting for the
curvilinear nature of cracks that, in conjunction with a discrete formulation
of the interaction integral, yield optimally convergent stress intensity
factors. We formulate three pairs of auxiliary and material variation fields
chosen to yield a simple expression of the interaction integral for different
classes of problems. The formulation accounts for crack face tractions and body
forces. Distinct features of the fields are their ease of construction and
implementation. The resulting stress intensity factors are observed converging
at a rate that doubles the one of the stress field. We provide a sketch of the
theoretical justification for the observed convergence rates, and discuss
issues such as quadratures and domain approximations needed to attain such
convergent behavior. Through two representative examples, a circular arc crack
and a loaded power function crack, we illustrate the convergence rates of the
computed stress intensity factors. The numerical results also show the
independence of the method on the size of the domain of integration.
