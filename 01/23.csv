higher education assignment, or for entry-level labour markets. In this paper
we explore the computational aspects of a possible similar scheme for assigning
teachers to schools. Our model is motivated by a particular characteristic of
the education system in many countries where each teacher specializes in two
subjects. We seek stable matchings, which ensure that no teacher and school
have the incentive to deviate from their assignments. Indeed we propose two
stability definitions depending on the precise format of schools' preferences.
If the schools' ranking of applicants is independent of their subjects of
specialism, we show that the problem of deciding whether a stable matching
exists is NP-complete, even if there are only three subjects, unless there are
master lists of applicants or of schools. By contrast, if the schools may order
applicants differently in each of their specialization subjects, the problem of
deciding whether a stable matching exists is NP-complete even in the presence
of subject-specific master lists plus a master list of schools. Finally, we
prove a strong inapproximability result for the problem of finding a matching
with the minimum number of blocking pairs with respect to both stability
definitions.

27,000 cases and 11,000 deaths as of June 2015. The public health response was
challenged by difficulties with disease surveillance, which impacted subsequent
analysis and decision-making regarding optimal interventions. We developed a
stage-structured model of Ebola virus disease (EVD). A key feature of the model
is that it includes a generalized correction term accounting for factors such
as the fraction of cases reported and fraction of the population at risk (e.g.
due to contact patterns, interventions, spatiotemporal spread, pre-existing
immunity, asymptomatic cases, etc.). We generated a range of short-term
forecasts for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, which we then validated using
subsequent data. We also used the model to examine the uncertainty in the
relative contributions to transmission by the different stages of infection
(early, late, and funeral). We found that a wide range of forecasted
trajectories fit approximately equally well to the early data. However, by
including the correction factor term the best-fit models correctly forecasted
EVD activity for all three countries, both individually and for all countries
combined. In particular, the model correctly forecasted the slow-down in
Liberia, as well as the continued exponential growth in Sierra Leone through
November 2014. Parameter unidentifiability issues hindered estimation of the
relative contributions of each stage of transmission from incidence and deaths
data alone, which poses a challenge in determining optimal intervention
strategies, and underscores the need for additional data collection. Even with
these limited data, however, it is still possible to accurately capture and
predict the epidemic dynamics by using a simplified correction term that
approximately accounts for the complex underlying factors driving disease
spread.

the analogous problem for LTL. We also show that for Markov decision processes
the problem becomes more delicate, but when restricting the frequency bound $p$

world. According to Aristotle's relational theory, time is a measure of change
and does not exist on its own. In contrast, quantum mechanics, just like
Newtonian mechanics, is equipped with a master clock that dictates the
evolution of a system. This clock is infinitely precise and tacitly supplied
free of charge from outside physics. Not only does this absolute time make it
notoriously difficult to make a consistent theory of quantum gravity, it is
also the underlying problem in establishing the second law. Indeed, contrary to
our experience, the Wheeler-deWitt equation --a canonical quantization of
general relativity-- predicts a static universe. Similarly, when simply
concerned with the dynamics of a closed quantum system, there is no second law
because the Von Neumann entropy is invariant under unitary transformations.
Here we are mainly concerned with the latter problem and we show that it can be
resolved by attributing a minimal amount of resources to the measurement of
time. Although there is an absolute time in quantum mechanics, an observer can
only establish a time by measuring a clock. For a local measurement, the
minimal entropy production is equal to the number of ticks. This lower bound is
attained by a black hole.

second-order spatial dispersion, we exploit the equivalence of first-order
spatial dispersion and reciprocal bianisotropic electromagnetic response to
deduce a simple expression for the metamaterial chirality tensor. Such an
expression allows us to systematically analyze the effect of the composite
spatial symmetry properties on electromagnetic chirality. We find that even if
a metamaterial is geometrically achiral, i.e. it is indistinguishable from its
mirror image, it shows pseudo-chiral-omega electromagnetic chirality if the
rotation needed to restore the dielectric profile after the reflection is
either a $0^\circ$ or $90^\circ$ rotation around an axis orthogonal to the

obtained from moments of the measured 2-point clustering statistics, with
respect to the cosine of the angle to the line of sight $\mu$. The position of
the BAO features in each moment depends on a combination of $D_A(z)$ and
$H(z)$, and measuring the positions in two or more moments breaks this

combinations measured from moments given by Legendre polynomials, power laws
and top-hat Wedges in $\mu$, showing explicitly what is being measured by each
in real-space for both the correlation function and power spectrum, and in
redshift-space for the power spectrum. The large volume covered by modern
galaxy samples means that the correlation function can be well approximated as
having no correlations at different $\mu$ on the BAO scale, and that the errors
on this scale are approximately independent of $\mu$. Using these

that measurements made using either the monopole and quadrupole, or the

mass of the black hole over the mass of the galaxy. The exponent $p$ is found
numerically to obtain values in the range $p \approx 0.3$--$0.5$. We propose a
theoretical interpretation of these exponents, based on estimates of local
`stretching numbers', i.e. local Lyapunov exponents at successive transits of
the orbits through the black hole's sphere of influence. We thus predict
$p=2/3-q$ with $q\approx 0.1$--$0.2$. Our basic model refers to elliptical
galaxy models with a central core. However, we find numerically that an
effective power law scaling of $L$ with $m$ holds also in models with central
cusp, beyond a mass scale up to which chaos is dominated by the influence of
the cusp itself. We finally show numerically that an analogous law exists also
in disc galaxies with rotating bars. In the latter case, chaotic scattering by
the black hole affects mainly populations of thick tube-like orbits surrounding
some low-order branches of the $x_1$ family of periodic orbits, as well as its
bifurcations at low-order resonances, mainly the Inner Lindbland resonance and
the 4/1 resonance. Implications of the correlations between $L$ and $m$ to

products and HNN extensions can be decided efficiently for elements which
cannot be conjugated into the base groups. This observation asks for a bound on
how many such elements there are. Such bounds can be derived using the theory
of amenable graphs:
  In this work we examine Schreier graphs of amalgamated products and HNN
extensions. For an amalgamated product $G = H *_A K $ with $[H:A] \geq [K:A]
\geq 2$, the Schreier graph with respect to $H$ or $K$ turns out to be
non-amenable if and only if $[H:A] \geq 3$. Moreover, for an HNN extension of
the form $G = <H,b | bab^{-1}=\phi(a), a \in A >$, we show that the Schreier
graph of $G$ with respect to the subgroup $H$ is non-amenable if and only if $A
\neq H \neq \phi(A)$.
  As application of these characterizations we show that under certain
conditions the conjugacy problem in fundamental groups of finite graphs of
groups with free abelian vertex groups can be solved in polynomial time on a
strongly generic set. Furthermore, the conjugacy problem in groups with more
than one end can be solved with a strongly generic algorithm which has
essentially the same time complexity as the word problem. These are rather
striking results as the word problem might be easy, but the conjugacy problem
might be even undecidable. Finally, our results yield another proof that the

abnormal behaviors of elderly people living at home. The method relies on

abnormal activity routines that may indicate the onset of early symptoms of
mild cognitive impairment. A non-intrusive sensor-based infrastructure acquires
low-level data about the interaction of the individual with home appliances and

diagnosis. In order to evaluate our method we have developed a prototype of the

(NP) associated with a high mass scale, $M$, beyond the range of the LHC. In
order to maintain the same {\it relative} mass reach for NP, $M/{\sqrt s}$, as
$\sqrt s$ increases, Richter recently reminded us that the required integrated
luminosity obtainable at future hadron colliders (FHC) must grow rapidly, $\sim
s$, in the limit of naive scaling. This would imply, eg, a $\sim 50$-fold
increase in the required integrated luminosity when going from the 14 TeV LHC
to a FHC with $\sqrt s=100$ TeV, an increase that would prove quite challenging
on many different fronts. In this paper we point out, due to the scaling
violations associated with the evolution of the parton density functions (PDFs)
and the running of the strong coupling, $\alpha_s$, that the actual luminosity
necessary in order to maintain any fixed value of the relative mass reach is
somewhat greater than this scaling result indicates. However, the actual values
of the required luminosity scaling are found to be dependent upon the detailed
nature of the NP being considered. Here we elucidate this point explicitly by
employing several specific benchmark examples of possible NP scenarios and
briefly discuss the (relatively weak) search impact in each case if these

which results in an accurate inverse solution with quantification of parameter

ten of the nearest and brightest nuclear clusters residing in late-type spiral
galaxies, in seven bands that span the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared.
Structural properties of the clusters were measured by fitting two-dimensional
surface brightness profiles to the images using GALFIT. The clusters exhibit a
wide range of structural properties. For six of the ten clusters in our sample,
we find changes in the effective radius with wavelength, suggesting radially
varying stellar populations. In four of the objects, the effective radius
increases with wavelength, indicating the presence of a younger population
which is more concentrated than the bulk of the stars in the cluster. However,
we find a general decrease in effective radius with wavelength in two of the
objects in our sample, which may indicate extended, circumnuclear star
formation. We also find a general trend of increasing roundness of the clusters
at longer wavelengths, as well as a correlation between the axis ratios of the
NCs and their host galaxies. These observations indicate that blue disks
aligned with the host galaxy plane are a common feature of nuclear clusters in
late-type galaxies, but are difficult to detect in galaxies that are close to
face-on. In color-color diagrams spanning the near-UV through the near-IR, most
of the clusters lie far from single-burst evolutionary tracks, showing evidence
for multi-age populations. Most of the clusters have integrated colors
consistent with a mix of an old population (> 1 Gyr) and a young population
(~100-300 Myr). The wide wavelength coverage of our data provides a sensitivity
to populations with a mix of ages that would not be possible to achieve with
imaging in optical bands only.

this approach by assuming that our observations are {\it qualitative}

opposed to quantitative observations of the state of the system. An important
feature of this approach is that it unifies naturally the system identification
and the system design problems, where the properties, instead of observations,
represent requirements to be satisfied. We develop a principled statistical
estimation procedure based on maximising the likelihood of the system's

demonstrate the efficacy and broad applicability of our method on a range of

robust regression, a suite of novel dimensionality and set-reduction algorithms
is developed. The advocated sketch-and-validate (SkeVa) family includes two
algorithms that rely on K-means clustering per iteration on reduced number of
dimensions and/or feature vectors: The first operates in a batch fashion, while
the second sequential one offers computational efficiency and suitability with
streaming modes of operation. For clustering even nonlinearly separable
vectors, the SkeVa family offers also a member based on user-selected kernel
functions. Further trading off performance for reduced complexity, a fourth
member of the SkeVa family is based on a divergence criterion for selecting
proper minimal subsets of feature variables and vectors, thus bypassing the
need for K-means clustering per iteration. Extensive numerical tests on
synthetic and real data sets highlight the potential of the proposed
algorithms, and demonstrate their competitive performance relative to
state-of-the-art random projection alternatives.

observed at 8 K under ambient pressure, which is in good agreement with the
Slater-Pauling rule. MS values are found to be independent of pressure, which
is a prerequisite for half-metals. The ab-initio electronic structure
calculations predict half-metallic nature for the alloy with a spin slitting
energy of 0.31 eV. Importantly, this system shows a high current spin
polarization value of 0.67 [with error of 0.02], as deduced from the point
contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) measurements. Linear dependence of electrical
resistivity with temperature indicates the possibility of reasonably high spin
polarization at elevated temperatures (~150 K) as well. All these suggest that
CoFeCrAl is a promising material for the spintronic devices.

can be described based on continuum mechanical sharp-interface balances of
mass, momentum and species mass. In this context, the standard model consists
of the two-phase Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids with
constant surface tension, complemented by reaction-advection-diffusion
equations for all constituents, employing Fick's law. This standard model is
inconsistent with the continuity equation, the momentum balance and the second
law of thermodynamics. The present paper reports on the details of these severe
shortcomings and provides thermodynamically consistent model extensions which
are required to capture various phenomena which occur due to the multi-physics
of interfacial mass transfer. In particular, we provide a simple derivation of
the interface Maxwell-Stefan equations which does not require a time scale
separation, while the main contribution is to show how interface concentrations
and interface chemical potentials mediate the influence on mass transfer of a
transfer component exerted by the change in interface energy due to an

social networks. Because the word ""community"" is an ambiguous term, it is
necessary to quantify what it means to be a community within the context of a
particular type of problem. Our interpretation is that this quantification must
be done at a minimum of three scales. These scales are at the level of:
individual nodes, individual communities, and the network as a whole. Each of
these scales involves quantitative features of community structure that are not
accurately represented at the other scales, but are important for defining a
particular notion of community. Our work focuses on providing sensible ways to
quantify what is desired at each of these scales for a notion of community
applicable to social networks, and using these models to develop a community
detection algorithm. Appealing features of our approach is that it naturally
allows for nodes to belong to multiple communities, and is computationally
efficient for large networks with low overall edge density. The scaling of the
algorithm is $O(N~\overline{k^2} + \overline{N_{com}^2})$, where $N$ is the
number of nodes in the network, $\overline{N_{com}^2}$ is the average squared
community size, and $\overline{k^2}$ is the expected value of a node's degree
squared. Although our work focuses on developing a computationally efficient
algorithm for overlapping community detection in the context of social
networks, our primary contribution is developing a methodology that is highly
modular and can easily be adapted to target specific notions of community.

is possible to obtain from APOGEE spectra. However, the Li-rich star also has
abnormal asteroseismic properties that call into question its membership in the
cluster, even though its radial velocity and location on color-magnitude

measured a wide array of abundances in the Li-rich star and three comparison
stars using spectra taken as part of the APOGEE survey to determine the degree
of stellar mixing, address the question of membership, and measure the surface
gravity. We confirm that the Li-rich star is a red giant with the same overall

lower, consistent with the asteroseismology results and suggestive of a very
low mass if the star is indeed a cluster member. Regardless of the cluster

this coupling can be strongly affected by an external electric field, hence the

realization of exotic excitations in materials (e.g. quasiparticles) that have
no analogy (or have not yet been observed) in the actual physical vacuum of
free space. Although they are not fundamental particles, such quasiparticles do
constitute the most basic description of the excited states of the ""vacuum"" in
which they reside. In this regard the magnetic textures of the excited states
of spin ices, magnetic pyrochlore oxides with dominant Ising interactions, are
proposed to be modeled as effective magnetic charge monopoles. Recent inelastic
neutron scattering experiments have established the pyrochlore material
Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ (YbTO) as a quantum spin ice, where in addition to the Ising
interactions there are substantial transverse terms that may induce quantum
dynamics and - in principle - coherent monopole motion. Here we report a
combined time domain terahertz spectroscopy (TDTS) and microwave cavity study
of YbTO to probe its complex dynamic magnetic susceptibility. We find that the
form of the susceptibility is consistent with monopole motion and a magnetic
monopole conductivity can be defined and measured. Using the unique phase
sensitive capabilities of these techniques, we observe a sign change in the
reactive part of the magnetic response. In generic models of monopole motion
this is only possible through introducing inertial effects, e.g. a mass
dependent term, to the equations of motion. Analogous to conventional electric
charge systems, measurement of the conductivity's spectral weight allows us to
derive a value for the magnetic monopole mass, which we find to be
approximately 1800 electron masses. Our results establish the magnetic
monopoles of quantum spin ice as true coherently propagating quasiparticles of

mounting evidence that the molecular gas can exist in two phases: one that is

order to investigate these two molecular components further, we compare the
fluxes and line widths of CO in NGC 4736 and NGC 5055, two nearby spiral
galaxies for which high-quality interferometric as well as single-dish data
sets are available. Our analysis leads to two main results: 1) Employing three
different methods, we determine the flux recovery of the interferometer as
compared to the single-dish to be within a range of 35-74% for NGC4736 and
81-92% for NGC5055, and 2) when focusing on high (SNR>5) lines of sight, the
single-dish line widths are larger by ~(40+-20)% than the ones derived from
interferometric data; which is in agreement with stacking all lines of sight.
These results point to a molecular gas component that is distributed over
spatial scales larger than 30""(~1kpc), and is therefore filtered out by the
interferometer. The available observations do not allow us to distinguish
between a truly diffuse gas morphology and a uniform distribution of small
clouds that are separated by less than the synthesized beam size (~3"" or
~100pc), as they would both be invisible for the interferometer. This high

1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) is vapor deposited along the length

distributions with a slight excess or deficit of mass at the string midpoint.
The added mass is then allowed to sublimate away under vacuum conditions, with
the device returning to its original state over about 4 h (and the resonance
frequencies, measured via optical interferometry, relaxing back to their
pre-mass-deposition values). Our claim is that the detailed time trace of
observed frequency shifts is rich in information---not only about the quantity
of RDX initially deposited but also about its spatial arrangement along the
nanostring. The data also reveal that sublimation in this case follows a
nontrivial rate law, consistent with mass loss occurring at the exposed surface
area of the RDX crystallites.

from the end of January until late June for a total exposure time of about 7
Ms. SNe Ia light curves are understood to be powered by the radioactive decay
of iron peak elements of which $^{56}$Ni is dominantly synthesized during the
thermonuclear disruption of a CO white dwarf (WD). The measurement of
$\gamma$-ray lines from the decay chain
$^{56}$Ni$\rightarrow$$^{56}$Co$\rightarrow$$^{56}$Fe provides unique
information about the explosion in supernovae. Canonical models assume
$^{56}$Ni buried deeply in the supernova cloud, absorbing most of the early
$\gamma$-rays, and only the consecutive decay of $^{56}$Co should become
directly observable through the overlaying material several weeks after the
explosion when the supernova envelope dilutes as it expands. Surprisingly, with
the spectrometer on INTEGRAL, SPI, we detected $^{56}$Ni $\gamma$-ray lines at
158 and 812 keV at early times with flux levels corresponding to roughly 10% of
the total expected amount of $^{56}$Ni, and at relatively small velocities.
This implies some mechanism to create a major amout of $^{56}$Ni at the
outskirts, and at the same time to break the spherical symmetry of the
supernova. One plausible explanation would be a belt accreted from a He
companion star, exploding, and triggering the explosion of the white dwarf. The
full set of observations of SN2014J show $^{56}$Co $\gamma$-ray lines at 847
and 1238 keV, and we determine for the first time a SN Ia $\gamma$-ray light
curve. The irregular appearance of these $\gamma$-ray lines allows deeper
insights about the explosion morphology from its temporal evolution and
provides additional evidence for an asymmetric explosion, from our
high-resolution spectroscopy and comparisons with recent models.

agreement between data and simulations, which may indicate that the termination
of star formation is too abrupt in the models.
  The mean star-formation rate (SFR) of model galaxies is well-defined and is
accurately modelled by a double power law at all redshifts: SFR proportional to
$1/(x^{-1.39}+x^{1.33})$, where $x=(t_a-t)/3.0\,$Gyr, $t$ is the age of the
stars and $t_a$ is the loopback time to the onset of galaxy formation; above a
redshift of unity, this is well approximated by a gamma function: SFR
proportional to $x^{1.5}e^{-x}$, where $x=(t_a-t)/2.0\,$Gyr. Individual
galaxies, however, show a wide dispersion about this mean. When split by mass,
the SFR peaks earlier for high-mass galaxies than for lower-mass ones, and we
interpret this downsizing as a mass-dependence in the evolution of the quenched

test the effect that both particle smoothing and particle splitting have on the
hydrodynamic properties of a collapsing halo at high redshift (z > 20).
Furthermore, we vary the background field intensity, with energy below the
Lyman limit (< 13.6 eV), as may be relevant for the case of metal-free star
formation and super-massive black hole seed formation. We find that using
particle splitting methods greatly increases our particle resolution without
introducing any numerical noise and allows us to achieve converged results over
a wide range of external background fields. Additionally, we find that for
lower values of the background field a lower dark matter particle mass is
required. We define the radius of the core as the point at which the enclosed
baryonic mass dominates over the enclosed dark matter mass. For our simulations
this results in $\rm{R_{core} \sim 5\ pc}$. We find that in order to produce
converged results which are not affected by dark matter particles requires that
the relationship ${M_{\rm{core}} / M_{\rm{DM}}} > 100.0$ be satisfied, where
${M_{\rm{core}}}$ is the enclosed baryon mass within the core and $M_{\rm{DM}}$
is the minimum dark matter particle mass. This ratio should provide a very
useful starting point for conducting convergence tests before any production
run simulations. We find that dark matter particle smoothing is a useful
adjunct to already highly resolved simulations.

smaller - are difficult to derive because traditional dating methods use
stellar properties that either change little as the stars age or are hard to
measure. The rotation rates of all cool stars decrease substantially with time
as the stars steadily lose their angular momenta. If properly calibrated,
rotation therefore can act as a reliable determinant of their ages based on the
method of gyrochronology. To calibrate gyrochronology, the relationship between
rotation period and age must be determined for cool stars of different masses,
which is best accomplished with rotation period measurements for stars in
clusters with well-known ages. Hitherto, such measurements have been possible
only in clusters with ages of less than about one billion years, and
gyrochronology ages for older stars have been inferred from model predictions.
Here we report rotation period measurements for 30 cool stars in the
2.5-billion-year-old cluster NGC 6819. The periods reveal a well-defined
relationship between rotation period and stellar mass at the cluster age,
suggesting that ages with a precision of order 10 per cent can be derived for
large numbers of cool Galactic field stars.

star formation in galaxies. However, the efficacy of the process in a
cosmological context remains unclear due to excessive radiative losses during
the shock propagation. To better understand the impact of SN explosions on the
evolution of galaxies, we perform a suite of high-resolution (12 pc), zoom-in
cosmological simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy at z=3 with adaptive mesh
refinement. We find that SN explosions can efficiently regulate star formation,
leading to the stellar mass and metallicity consistent with the observed
mass-metallicity relation and stellar mass-halo mass relation at z~3. This is
achieved by making three important changes to the classical feedback scheme: i)
the different phases of SN blast waves are modelled directly by injecting
radial momentum expected at each stage, ii) the realistic time delay of SNe,
commencing at as early as 3 Myr, is required to disperse very dense gas before
a runaway collapse sets in at the galaxy centre via mergers of gas clumps, and
iii) a non-uniform density distribution of the ISM is taken into account below
the computational grid scale for the cell in which SN explodes. The last
condition is motivated by the fact that our simulations still do not resolve
the detailed structure of a turbulent ISM in which the fast outflows can
propagate along low-density channels. The simulated galaxy with the SN feedback
model shows strong outflows, which carry approximately ten times larger mass
than star formation rate, as well as smoothly rising circular velocity. Other
feedback models that do not meet the three conditions form too many stars,
producing a peaked rotation curve. Our results suggest that understanding the
structure of the turbulent ISM may be crucial to assess the role of SN and
other feedback processes in galaxy formation theory.

gas in and around massive galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters, which is
thought to constitute a large fraction of the baryon content of the Universe.
The Planck collaboration recently performed a stacking analysis of a large
sample of `locally brightest galaxies' (LBGs) and, surprisingly, inferred an
approximately self-similar relation between the tSZ flux and halo mass. At face
value, this implies that the hot gas mass fraction is independent of halo mass,
a result which is in apparent conflict with resolved X-ray observations. We
test the robustness of the inferred trend using synthetic tSZ maps generated
from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and using the same tools and
assumptions applied in the Planck study. We show that, while the detection and
the estimate of the `total' flux (within $5 r_{500}$) is reasonably robust, the
inferred flux originating from within $r_{500}$ (i.e. the limiting radius to
which X-ray observations typically probe) is highly sensitive to the assumed
pressure distribution of the gas. Using our most realistic simulations with AGN
feedback, that reproduce a wide variety of X-ray and optical properties of
groups and clusters, we estimate that the derived tSZ flux within $r_{500}$ is
biased high by up to to an order of magnitude for haloes with masses $M_{500}

supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theories is encoded in the spectrum of the Mathieu
and Lam'e equations, respectively. This correspondence is usually expressed via
an all-orders Bohr-Sommerfeld relation, but this neglects non-perturbative
effects, the nature of which is very different in the electric, magnetic and
dyonic regions. In the gauge theory dyonic region the spectral expansions are
divergent, and indeed are not Borel-summable, so they are more properly
described by resurgent trans-series in which perturbative and non-perturbative
effects are deeply entwined. In the gauge theory electric region the spectral
expansions are convergent, but nevertheless there are non-perturbative effects
due to poles in the expansion coefficients, and which we associate with
worldline instantons. This provides a concrete analog of a phenomenon found
recently by Drukker, Marino and Putrov in the large N expansion of the ABJM
matrix model, in which non-perturbative effects are related to complex
space-time instantons. In this paper we study how these very different regimes
arise from an exact WKB analysis, and join smoothly through the magnetic
region. This approach also leads to a simple proof of a resurgence relation
found recently by Dunne and Unsal, showing that for these spectral systems all
non-perturbative effects are subtly encoded in perturbation theory, and
identifies this with the Picard-Fuchs equation for the quantized elliptic
curve.

  with Chan-Vese and Rudin-Osher-Fatemi Models",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Segmentation is a fundamental task for extracting semantically meaningful
regions from an image. The goal of segmentation algorithms is to accurately
assign object labels to each image location. However, image-noise, shortcomings
of algorithms, and image ambiguities cause uncertainty in label assignment.
Estimating the uncertainty in label assignment is important in multiple
application domains, such as segmenting tumors from medical images for
radiation treatment planning. One way to estimate these uncertainties is
through the computation of posteriors of Bayesian models, which is
computationally prohibitive for many practical applications. On the other hand,
most computationally efficient methods fail to estimate label uncertainty. We
therefore propose in this paper the Active Mean Fields (AMF) approach, a
technique based on Bayesian modeling that uses a mean-field approximation to
efficiently compute a segmentation and its corresponding uncertainty. Based on
a variational formulation, the resulting convex model combines any
label-likelihood measure with a prior on the length of the segmentation
boundary. A specific implementation of that model is the Chan-Vese segmentation
model (CV), in which the binary segmentation task is defined by a Gaussian
likelihood and a prior regularizing the length of the segmentation boundary.
Furthermore, the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the AMF model are
equivalent to those of the popular Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model for image
denoising. Solutions to the AMF model can thus be implemented by directly
utilizing highly-efficient ROF solvers on log-likelihood ratio fields. We
qualitatively assess the approach on synthetic data as well as on real natural
and medical images. For a quantitative evaluation, we apply our approach to the
icgbench dataset.

in mergers involving dwarf galaxies. UGC 6741 has currently the color and star
formation properties of Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDs). However the
analysis of its surface photometry suggests that the galaxy lies within the
scaling relations defined by early-type dwarf galaxies (dEs). Thus UGC 6741
appears as a promising system to study the possible transformation of BCDs into
dEs, through possibly a merger episode. The frequency of such dwarf-dwarf
mergers should now be explored.

hot temperatures observed in radio observations. During this same period, the
unstable thermonuclear burning transitions to a prolonged period of stable
burning of the remnant hydrogen-rich envelope, causing the WD to become,
temporarily, a super-soft X-ray source. We show that photoionization heating of
the expanding ejecta by the hot WD maintains the observed nearly constant
temperature of $(1-4)\times10^4\mathrm{~K}$ for up to a year before an eventual
decline in temperature due to either the cessation of the supersoft phase or
the onset of a predominantly adiabatic expansion. We simulate the expanding

fill in the details of the UKC, is intended for newcomers to the field who may
appreciate a more explicit formulation and development of the main ideas. The
crux of the exposition is an analogue of the Yoneda Lemma for co-sieves that
relates geometric open boxes bijectively to their algebraic counterparts, much
as its progenitor for representables relates geometric cubes to their algebraic
counterparts in a cubical set. This characterization is used to give a
formulation of uniform Kan fibrations in which uniformity emerges as naturality

information (CDI) of spatially correlated three-dimensional (3D)
multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) channels. To reduce the dimension for
quantizing the CDI of large antenna arrays, we introduce a special structure to
the codewords by using Tucker decomposition to exploit the unique features of
3D MIMO channels. Specifically, the codeword consists of four parts each with
low dimension individually targeting at a different type of information:
statistical CDIs in horizontal direction and in vertical direction, statistical
power coupling, and instantaneous CDI. The proposed codebook avoids the
redundancy led by existing independent CDI quantization. Analytical results
provide a sufficient condition on 3D MIMO channels to show that the proposed
codebook can achieve the same quantization performance as the well-known
rotated codebook applied to the global channel CDI, but with significant
reduction in the required statistical channel information. Simulation results
validate our analysis and demonstrate that the proposed joint CDI quantization
provides substantial performance gain over independent CDI quantization.

adapt their phases such that the relayed signals add up constructively at the
designated receiver. This yields received SNR scaling linearly with N, while
avoiding the linear increase in overhead incurred by a direct approach in which
received signals are separately quantized and transmitted for centralized
processing. By transforming the task of long-distance distributed receive
beamforming into one of local distributed transmit beamforming, we can leverage
a scalable one-bit feedback algorithm for phase synchronization. We show that
time division between the long-distance and local links eliminates the need for
explicit frequency synchronization. We provide an analytical framework, whose
results closely match Monte Carlo simulations, to evaluate the impact of phase
noise due to relaying delay on the performance of the one-bit feedback

type of overlapping community structure, in which the detection of weak, but
meaningful, communities is hindered by the presence of stronger communities. We
present Hidden Community Detection HICODE, an algorithm template that
identifies both the strong, dominant community structure as well as the weaker,
hidden community structure in networks. HICODE begins by first applying an
existing community detection algorithm to a network, and then removing the
structure of the detected communities from the network. In this way, the
structure of the weaker communities becomes visible. Through application of
HICODE, we demonstrate that a wide variety of real networks from different
domains contain many communities that, though meaningful, are not detected by
any of the popular community detection algorithms that we consider.
Additionally, on both real and synthetic networks containing a hidden
ground-truth community structure, HICODE uncovers this structure better than
any baseline algorithms that we compared against. For example, on a real
network of undergraduate students that can be partitioned either by `Dorm'
(residence hall) or `Year', we see that HICODE uncovers the weaker `Year'
communities with a JCRecall score (a recall-based metric that we define in the
text) of over 0.7, while the baseline algorithms achieve scores below 0.2.

The common theme amongst these views is the need to store and operate on data

common mathematical representation of these data sets (associative arrays) that
applies across a wide range of applications and technologies. Associative
arrays unify and simplify these different approaches for representing and
manipulating data into common two-dimensional view of data. Specifically,
associative arrays (1) reduce the effort required to pass data between steps in
a data processing system, (2) allow steps to be interchanged with full
confidence that the results will be unchanged, and (3) make it possible to
recognize when steps can be simplified or eliminated. Most database system

proposed VTR algorithms: a heuristic method and a neural networks based method.
Then we present insights on how to transform these VTR methods to their tunable

control parameter is needed. In the second part of the paper, through a
probabilistic analysis we find an optimal parameter for the neural network

surface, whereby each point of the movement space of the scanner can be
characterized by a unique set of scale factors. Feature-oriented scanning (FOS)
methodology is used as a basis for implementation of the distributed
calibration permitting to exclude in situ the negative influence of thermal
drift, creep and hysteresis on the obtained results. Possessing the calibration
database enables correcting in one procedure all the spatial distortions caused
by nonlinearity, nonorthogonality and spurious crosstalk couplings of the
microscope scanner piezomanipulators. To provide high precision of spatial
measurements in nanometer range, the calibration is carried out using natural
standards - constants of crystal lattice. One of the useful modes of the
developed calibration method is a virtual mode. In the virtual mode, instead of
measurement of a real surface of the standard, the calibration program makes a
surface image ""measurement"" of the standard, which was obtained earlier using
conventional raster scanning. The application of the virtual mode permits
simulation of the calibration process and detail analysis of raster distortions
occurring in both conventional and counter surface scanning. Moreover, the mode

technique for com- plex fluid, is widely employed in non-equilibrium
simulations of soft matter systems. To maintain a defined thermodynamic state,
thermalization of the fluid is often required for certain MPC variants. We
investigate the influence of three thermostats on the non-equilibrium
properties of a MPC fluid under shear or in Poiseuille flow. In all cases, the
local velocities are scaled by a factor, which is either determined via a local
simple scaling approach (LSS), a Monte Carlo-like procedure (MCS), or by the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of kinetic energy (MBS). We find that the
various scal- ing schemes leave the flow profile unchanged and maintain the
local temperature well. The fluid viscosities extracted from the various
simulations are in close agreement. Moreover, the numerically determined
viscosities are in remarkably good agreement with the respective theoretically
predicted values. At equilibrium, the calculation of the dynamic structure
factor reveals that the MBS method closely resembles an isothermal ensemble,
whereas the MCS procedure exhibits signatures of an adi- abatic system at
larger collision-time steps. Since the velocity distribution of the LSS
approach is non-Gaussian, we recommend to apply the MBS thermostat, which has
been shown to produce the correct velocity distribution even under
non-equilibrium conditions.

anisotropic antiferromagnetic intra-chain exchange interaction between Ir and

electronic structure calculations, showing the importance of Ir spin orbit

continuously scanned by either ground- or spaced-based facilities. For the low
Earth orbit, radar telescopes are the workhorse for this task, especially due
to their continuous availability. However, optical observation methods can
deliver complementary information, especially towards high accuracy
measurements. Passive-optical observations are inexpensive and can yield very
precise information about the apparent position of the object in the sky via
comparison with background stars. However, the object's distance from the
observer is not readily accessible, which constitutes a major drawback of this
approach for the precise calculation of the orbital elements. Two experimental
methods have been devised to overcome this problem: Using two observatories a
few kilometres apart, strictly simultaneous observations of the same object
yield an accurate, instantaneous 3D position determination through measurement
of the parallax. If only one observatory is available, a pulsed laser can be
used in addition to the passive-optical channel to measure the distance to the
object, in a similar fashion as used by the satellite laser ranging community.
However, compared to conventional laser ranging, a stronger laser and more
elaborate tracking algorithms are necessary. The two approaches can also be
combined by illuminating the object with a pulsed laser from one observatory
and measuring the return times at both observatories. These techniques are
explored by German Aerospace Center in Stuttgart using its orbital debris
research observatory, in cooperation with the Satellite Laser Ranging station
in Graz and the Geodetic Observatory in Wettzell. This contribution will
present some of the results and plans for further measurement campaigns.

Moreover, due to significant channel attenuation and presence of hardware
impairments, e.g., phase noise and amplifier nonlinearities, the vast bandwidth

enable the development of multi-Gigabit per second wireless networks, we
introduce a novel millimeter-wave HetNet paradigm, termed hybrid HetNet, which
exploits the vast bandwidth and propagation characteristics in the 60 GHz and
70-80 GHz bands to reduce the impact of interference in HetNets. Simulation
results are presented to illustrate the performance advantage of hybrid HetNets
with respect to traditional networks. Next, two specific transceiver structures
that enable hand-offs from the 60 GHz band, i.e., the V-band to the 70-80 GHz
band, i.e., the E-band, and vice versa are proposed. Finally, the practical and
regulatory challenges for establishing a hybrid HetNet are outlined.

multiple interacting processes, and both are capable of significantly affecting
sediment budgets. These sediment mass movements also have the potential to
significantly impact on a broad network of ecosystems health, functionality and
the services they provide. To support the integrated assessment of these
processes it is necessary to develop reliable modelling architectures. This
paper proposes a semi-quantitative integrated methodology for a robust
assessment of soil erosion rates in data poor regions affected by landslide
activity. It combines heuristic, empirical and probabilistic approaches. This
proposed methodology is based on the geospatial semantic array programming
paradigm and has been implemented on a catchment scale methodology using
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial analysis tools and GNU Octave. The
integrated data-transformation model relies on a modular architecture, where
the information flow among modules is constrained by semantic checks. In order
to improve computational reproducibility, the geospatial data transformations
implemented in ESRI ArcGis are made available in the free software GRASS GIS.
The proposed modelling architecture is flexible enough for future
transdisciplinary scenario analysis to be more easily designed. In particular,
the architecture might contribute as a novel component to simplify future
integrated analyses of the potential impact of wildfires or vegetation types
and distributions, on sediment transport from water induced landslides and
erosion.

These instruments routinely measure the conductance across the nano-sized
electrodes as they are brought into contact and separated, permitting
conductance traces to be recorded that are plots of conductance versus the
distance between the electrodes. One interesting feature of the conductance
traces is that for some metals and geometric configurations a jump in the value
of the conductance is observed right before contact between the electrodes, a
phenomenon known as jump-to-contact. This paper considers, from a computational
point of view, the dynamics of contact between two gold nano-electrodes.
Repeated indentation of the two surfaces on each other is performed in two
crystallographic orientations of face-centred cubic gold, namely (001) and
(111). Ultimately, the intention is to identify the structures at the atomic
level at the moment of first contact between the surfaces, since the value of
the conductance is related to the minimum cross-section in the contact region.
Conductance values obtained in this way are determined using first principles
electronic transport calculations, with atomic configurations taken from the
molecular dynamics simulations serving as input structures.

""ordinary"" addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, which are defined by
transfinite iteration; and the ""natural"" (or Hessenberg) addition and
multiplication (denoted $\oplus$ and $\otimes$), each satisfying its own set of
algebraic laws. In 1909, Jacobsthal considered a third, intermediate way of
multiplying ordinals (denoted $\times$), defined by transfinite iteration of
natural addition, as well as the notion of exponentiation defined by
transfinite iteration of his multiplication, which we denote
$\alpha^{\times\beta}$. (Jacobsthal's multiplication was later rediscovered by
Conway.) Jacobsthal showed these operations too obeyed algebraic laws. In this
paper, we pick up where Jacobsthal left off by considering the notion of
exponentiation obtained by transfinitely iterating natural multiplication
instead; we will denote this $\alpha^{\otimes\beta}$. We show that
$\alpha^{\otimes(\beta\oplus\gamma)} = (\alpha^{\otimes\beta})
\otimes(\alpha^{\otimes\gamma})$ and that

problem in coding and cryptography. In this paper, the classic
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
is adapted for lattice Gaussian sampling. Two MH-based algorithms are proposed,
which overcome the restriction suffered by the default Klein's algorithm. The
first one, referred to as the independent Metropolis-Hastings-Klein (MHK)
algorithm, tries to establish a Markov chain through an independent proposal
distribution. We show that the Markov chain arising from the independent MHK
algorithm is uniformly ergodic, namely, it converges to the stationary
distribution exponentially fast regardless of the initial state. Moreover, the
rate of convergence is explicitly calculated in terms of the theta series,
leading to a predictable mixing time. In order to further exploit the
convergence potential, a symmetric Metropolis-Klein (SMK) algorithm is
proposed. It is proven that the Markov chain induced by the SMK algorithm is
geometrically ergodic, where a reasonable selection of the initial state is
capable to enhance the convergence performance.

suppression methods in a low-background environment, for future application in
the GERDA experiment. Similar to GERDA, LArGe operates bare germanium detectors
submersed into liquid argon (1 m$^3$, 1.4 tons), which in addition is
instrumented with photomultipliers to detect argon scintillation light. The
scintillation signals are used in anti-coincidence with the germanium detectors
to effectively suppress background events that deposit energy in the liquid
argon. The background suppression efficiency was studied in combination with a
pulse shape discrimination (PSD) technique using a BEGe detector for various
sources, which represent characteristic backgrounds to GERDA. Suppression
factors of a few times $10^3$ have been achieved. First background data of
LArGe with a coaxial HPGe detector (without PSD) yield a background index of
(0.12$-$4.6)$\cdot 10^{-2}$ cts/(keV$\cdot$kg$\cdot$y) (90% C.L.), which is at
the level of GERDA Phase I. Furthermore, for the first time we monitor the
natural $^{42}$Ar abundance (parallel to GERDA), and have indication for the
$2\nu\beta\beta$-decay in natural germanium. These results show the effectivity
of an active liquid argon veto in an ultra-low background environment. As a

pursued.

regime for the measurement of nuclear spin-spin interactions free from effects
of large magnetic fields, such as truncation of terms that do not commute with
the Zeeman Hamiltonian. One such interaction, the magnetic dipole-dipole
coupling, is a valuable source of spatial information in NMR, though many terms
are unobservable in high-field NMR, and the coupling averages to zero under
isotropic molecular tumbling. Under partial alignment, this information is
retained in the form of so-called residual dipolar couplings. We report zero-
to ultra-low-field NMR measurements of residual dipolar couplings in
acetonitrile-2-$^{13}$C aligned in stretched polyvinyl acetate gels. This
represents the first investigation of dipolar couplings as a perturbation on
the indirect spin-spin $J$-coupling in the absence of an applied magnetic
field. As a consequence of working at zero magnetic field, we observe terms of
the dipole-dipole coupling Hamiltonian that are invisible in conventional
high-field NMR. This technique expands the capabilities of zero- to
ultra-low-field NMR and has potential applications in precision measurement of
subtle physical interactions, chemical analysis, and characterization of local
mesoscale structure in materials.

suitable choice of model parameter values, the bulk reaction-diffusion system
can induce patterning on the surface independent of whether the surface

surface reaction-diffusion system can not generate patterns everywhere in the
bulk in the absence of patterning from the bulk reaction-diffusion system. For
this case, patterns can only be induced in regions close to the surface

$\ln \tau\sim \xi^\psi/T$ , with $\psi$ an \textit{a priori} unknown barrier
exponent. Through a nonperturbative functional renormalization group, we show
that for spatial dimensions $d$ less than a critical value $d_{DR} \simeq 5.1$,
also associated with dimensional-reduction breakdown, $\psi=\theta$ with
$\theta$ the temperature exponent near the zero-temperature fixed point that
controls the critical behavior. For $d>d_{DR}$ on the other hand,
$\psi=\theta-2\lambda$ where $\theta=2$ and $\lambda>0$ a new exponent. At the
upper critical dimension $d=6$, $\lambda=1$ so that $\psi=0$, and activated
scaling gives way to conventional scaling. We give a physical interpretation of
the results in terms of collective events in real space, avalanches and
droplets. We also propose a way to check the two regimes by computer
simulations of long-range 1-$d$ systems.

both theoretically and empirically. In particular we assess empirically the

using HARP there is an effective way of building the forecasting set since this

configuration triggered by temperature or chemistry can alter the magnetic
interactions responsible for the non-random atomic-spin orientation. Different
magnetic states, in turn, can give rise to substantially different macroscopic
properties. A classical example is iron, which exhibits a great variety of
properties as one gradually removes the magnetic long-range order by raising
the temperature towards and beyond its Curie point of
$T_{\text{C}}^{0}=1043$\,K. Using first-principles theory, here we demonstrate
that uniaxial tensile strain can also destabilize the magnetic order in iron
and eventually lead to a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition at
temperatures far below $T_{\text{C}}^{0}$. In consequence, the intrinsic
strength of the ideal single-crystal body-centered cubic iron dramatically
weakens above a critical temperature of $\sim 500$\,K. The discovered
strain-induced magneto-mechanical softening provides a plausible atomic-level
mechanism behind the observed drop of the measured strength of Fe whiskers
around $300-500$\,K. Alloying additions which have the capability to partially
restore the magnetic order in the strained Fe lattice, push the critical
temperature for the strength-softening scenario towards the magnetic transition
temperature of the undeformed lattice. This can result in a surprisingly large
alloying-driven strengthening effect at high temperature as illustrated here in
the case of Fe-Co alloy.

imperfect in a way that leaves the superpositions intact. This is the tails
problem. There are several ways of making this problem more precise. But many

Here I distinguish four distinct tails problems. The first (bare tails problem)

while the first is a pseudo-problem, the second has not been adequately
addressed. The third (multiverse tails problem) reformulates the second to

Therefore, it is crucial that modellers, analysts and biologists are able to
solve accurately and efficiently systems of highly nonlinear parabolic partial

evolving domains and surfaces. The main contribution of our paper is the study
of fully implicit schemes by use of the Newton method and the Picard iteration
applied to the backward Euler, the Crank-Nicolson (and its modifications) and
the fractional-step theta methods. Our results conclude that the
fractional-step theta method coupled with a single Newton iteration at each
timestep is as accurate as the fully adaptive Newton method; and both
outperform the Picard iteration. In particular, the results strongly support
the observation that a single Newton iteration is sufficient to yield as
accurate results as those obtained by use of an adaptive Newton method. This is
particularly advantageous when solving highly complex nonlinear partial
differential equations on evolving domains and surfaces. To validate our
theoretical results, various appropriate numerical experiments are exhibited on
stationary planary domains and in the bulk of stationary surfaces.

of the first scenario is used to show how interference in a coherent

in terms of an effective model consisting of a single wave packet scattered off
an attractive hard wall. The outcomes from this model are then applied to the
analysis of Wheeler's delayed choice experiment, also recreated by means of a
reliable realistic simulation. Both examples illustrate quite well how the

simulate the process of initializing cloud data centers, allocating virtual
machine requests and providing performance evaluation for various scheduling
algorithms. FlexCloud can be run on a single computer with JVM to simulate
large scale cloud environments with focus on infrastructure as a service;
adopts agile design patterns to assure the flexibility and extensibility;
models virtual machine migrations which is lack in the existing tools; provides
user-friendly interfaces for customized configurations and replaying. Comparing
to existing simulators, FlexCloud has combining features for supporting public
cloud providers, load-balance and energy-efficiency scheduling. FlexCloud has
advantage in computing time and memory consumption to support large-scale

meteoritics and planet formation. Recently an old idea has been revived: the
idea that chondrules form as a result of collisions between planetesimals in
which the ejected molten material forms small droplets which solidify to become
chondrules. Pre-melting of the planetesimals by radioactive decay of 26Al would
help producing sprays of melt even at relatively low impact velocity. In this
paper we study the radiative cooling of a ballistically expanding spherical
cloud of chondrule droplets ejected from the impact site. We present results
from a numerical radiative transfer models as well as analytic approximate
solutions. We find that the temperature after the start of the expansion of the
cloud remains constant for a time t_cool and then drops with time t
approximately as T ~ T_0[(3/5)t/t_cool+ 2/5]^(-5/3) for t>t_cool. The time at
which this temperature drop starts t_cool depends via an analytical formula on
the mass of the cloud, the expansion velocity and the size of the chondrule.
During the early isothermal expansion phase the density is still so high that
we expect the vapor of volatile elements to saturate so that no large volatile
losses are expected.

mathematical interest, this model is particularly suited for the description of
a mission of a spacecraft (e.g., a solar sail) to an asteroid.
  The aim of our study is to investigate the occurrence of bifurcations to halo

find a remarkable agreement between the two approaches. As a side result, we
also evaluate the influence of the different parameters, most notably the solar

implementing a center manifold reduction. Next, we estimate the bifurcation
values using qualitative techniques (e.g. Poincar\'e surfaces, frequency
analysis, FLIs). Concerning the analytical approach, following \cite{CPS} we
implement a resonant normal form, we transform to suitable action-angle
variables and we introduce a detuning parameter measuring the displacement from
the synchronous resonance. The bifurcation thresholds are then determined as
series expansions in the detuning. Three concrete examples are considered and

public health issue. In mathematical models of epidemics, such phenomena
involve the process of infections and recoveries passing through a critical
threshold where the basic reproductive ratio is 1.
  In this paper, we study near-critical behaviour in the context of a
susceptible-infective-recovered (SIR) epidemic on a random (multi)graph on $n$
vertices with a given degree sequence. We concentrate on the regime just above
the threshold for the emergence of a large epidemic, where the basic
reproductive ratio is $1 + \omega (n) n^{-1/3}$, with $\omega (n)$ tending to
infinity slowly as the population size, $n$, tends to infinity. We determine
the probability that a large epidemic occurs, and the size of a large epidemic.
  Our results require basic regularity conditions on the degree sequences, and
the assumption that the third moment of the degree of a random susceptible
vertex stays uniformly bounded as $n \to \infty$. As a corollary, we determine
the probability and size of a large near-critical epidemic on a standard
binomial random graph in the `sparse' regime, where the average degree is
constant. As a further consequence of our method, we obtain an improved result
on the size of the giant component in a random graph with given degrees just

recolour $G$ is to obtain a new proper colouring by changing the colour of one

$k$-colouring, $k>\Delta$, a $\Delta$-colouring of $G$ can be obtained by a
sequence of $O(n^2)$ recolourings using only the original $k$ colours unless
$G$ is a complete graph or a cycle with an odd number of vertices, or

crucial to identify major changes in the internal organization of many complex
systems, which may undergo important endogenous or exogenous events. This
analysis can be done in two ways: considering each snapshot as an independent
community detection problem or taking into account the whole evolution of the
network. In the first case, one can apply static methods on the temporal
snapshots, which correspond to configurations of the system in short time
windows, and match afterwards the communities across layers. Alternatively, one
can develop dedicated dynamic procedures, so that multiple snapshots are
simultaneously taken into account while detecting communities, which allows us
to keep memory of the flow. To check how well a method of any kind could
capture the evolution of communities, suitable benchmarks are needed. Here we
propose a model for generating simple dynamic benchmark graphs, based on
stochastic block models. In them, the time evolution consists of a periodic
oscillation of the system's structure between configurations with built-in
community structure. We also propose the extension of quality comparison

simulations on distributed memory architectures using a domain partitioning
approach. Collisions are modelled with hard contacts in order to hide their
micro-dynamics and thus to extend the time and length scales that can be
simulated. The multi-contact problem is solved using a non-linear block
Gauss-Seidel method that is conforming to the subdomain structure. The parallel
algorithms employ a sophisticated protocol between processors that delegate
algorithmic tasks such as contact treatment and position integration uniquely
and robustly to the processors. Communication overhead is minimized through
aggressive message aggregation, leading to excellent strong and weak scaling.
The robustness and scalability is assessed on three clusters including two
peta-scale supercomputers with up to 458752 processor cores. The simulations
can reach unprecedented resolution of up to ten billion non-spherical particles

technique used as a part of the process to generate test data for imperative
programs. Databases are ubiquitous in software and testing of programs
manipulating databases is thus essential to enhance the reliability of
software. This work proposes and evaluates experimentally a symbolic ex-
ecution algorithm for constraint-based testing of database programs. First, we
describe SimpleDB, a formal language which offers a minimal and well-defined
syntax and seman- tics, to model common interaction scenarios between pro-
grams and databases. Secondly, we detail the proposed al- gorithm for symbolic
execution of SimpleDB models. This algorithm considers a SimpleDB program as a
sequence of operations over a set of relational variables, modeling both the
database tables and the program variables. By inte- grating this relational
model of the program with classical static symbolic execution, the algorithm
can generate a set of path constraints for any finite path to test in the
control- flow graph of the program. Solutions of these constraints are test
inputs for the program, including an initial content for the database. When the
program is executed with respect to these inputs, it is guaranteed to follow
the path with re- spect to which the constraints were generated. Finally, the
algorithm is evaluated experimentally using representative SimpleDB models.

for sampling from complex, high-dimensional, often multi-modal probability
distributions. Most popular methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling,
perform poorly on strongly multi-modal probability distributions, rarely
jumping between modes or settling on just one mode without finding others.
Parallel tempering addresses this problem by sampling simultaneously with
separate Markov chains from tempered versions of the target distribution with
reduced contrast levels. Gaps between modes can be traversed at higher
temperatures, while individual modes can be efficiently explored at lower
temperatures. In this paper, we investigate how one might choose the ladder of
temperatures to achieve more efficient sampling, as measured by the
autocorrelation time of the sampler. In particular, we present a simple,
easily-implemented algorithm for dynamically adapting the temperature
configuration of a sampler while sampling. This algorithm dynamically adjusts
the temperature spacing to achieve a uniform rate of exchanges between chains
at neighbouring temperatures. We compare the algorithm to conventional
geometric temperature configurations on a number of test distributions and on
an astrophysical inference problem, reporting efficiency gains by a factor of
1.2-2.5 over a well-chosen geometric temperature configuration and by a factor
of 1.5-5 over a poorly chosen configuration. On all of these problems a sampler
using the dynamical adaptations to achieve uniform acceptance ratios between
neighbouring chains outperforms one that does not.

related frequencies. We show that in all three cases, when written in terms of
the original ""source parameters"", there exist a number of discrete
degeneracies, with different parameter values giving rise to the same
gravitational wave signal. We show how these can be removed by suitably
restricting the source parameter ranges. In the case of the model as written
down by Jones, there is also a continuous degeneracy. We show how to remove
this through a suitable rewriting in terms of ""waveform parameters"", chosen so
as to make the specialisations to the other stellar models particularly simple.
We briefly consider the (non-trivial) relation between the assignment of prior
probabilities on one set of parameters verses the other. The results of this
paper will be of use when designing strategies for carrying out searches for
such multi-harmonic gravitational wave signals, and when performing parameter
estimation in the event of a detection.

speed and simple fabrication in solid-state implementations. A couple of
interacting double-dot exchange-only qubits, each composed by three electrons
distributed in a double quantum dot, is exploited to realize controlled-NOT
(CNOT) operations. The effective Hamiltonian model of the composite system is
expressed by only exchange interactions between pairs of spins. Consequently,
the evolution operator has a simple form and represents the starting point for
the research of sequences of operations that realize CNOT gates. Two different
geometrical configurations of the pair are considered, and a numerical mixed
simplex and genetic algorithm is used. We compare the nonphysical case in which
all the interactions are controllable from the external and the realistic
condition in which intra-dot interactions are fixed by the geometry of the
system. In the latter case, we find the CNOT sequences for both the geometrical
configurations and we considered a qubit system where electrons are
electrostatically confined in two quantum dots in a silicon nanowire. The
effects of the geometrical sizes of the nanowire and of the gates on the
fundamental parameters controlling the qubit are studied by exploiting a
spin-density-functional theory-based simulator. Consequently, CNOT gate
performances are evaluated.

transform and cross-correlation techniques has been applied to Chandra HETG
spectra obtained in 1999 October of the rapidly rotating young star AB Doradus
in order to investigate its coronal topology. The observation lasted 52.3ks,
covering 1.2 rotation periods. The X-ray light curve obtained from integrating
the dispersed signal revealed a moderate intensity flare midway through the
exposure in which the count rate increased sharply by about 50% and
subsequently decayed over the next 10ks. We find no significant Doppler shifts
in the spectra or modulation of the light curve that could be attributed to
rotation of dominant coronal structures at this epoch. Individual spectral line
widths are statistically consistent with thermal broadening and formally
require no rotational broadening, while the $1\sigma$ limit to rotational
broadening corresponds to a compact corona restricted to latitudes $>57\deg$.
Fourier analysis suggests a small amount of rotational broadening is present
consistent with a corona restricted largely to the poles, and excludes models
with surface rotational broadening or greater. These results present direct
spectroscopic evidence that the dominant coronal activity on rapidly-rotating
active stars is associated with the dark polar spots commonly seen in
photospheric Doppler images, and support models in which these spots are of
mixed magnetic polarity that forms closed loops.

apply it to a concrete political problem: should a given political party form a
coalition or not? We focus on the situation of three political parties, and
divide the electorate into four groups: partisan supporters of each party and a
group of undecided voters. We consider party-party interactions of two forms:
shared or differing alliance attitudes. Our main results consist of
time-dependent decision functions for each of the three parties, and their
asymptotic values, i.e., their final decisions on whether or not to form a
coalition.

  Yang-Mills and Relativity"". It is an improvement in the presentation",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Flag manifolds are shown to describe the relations between configurations of
distinguished points (topologically equivalent to punctures) embedded in a
general spacetime manifold. Grassmannians are flag manifolds with just two
subsets of points selected out from a set of N points. The geometry of
Grassmannians is determined by a group acting by linear fractional
transformations, and the associated Lie algebra induces transitions between
subspaces. Curvature tensors are derived for a general flag manifold, showing
that interactions between a subset of k points and the remaining N-k points in
the configuration is determined by the coordinates in the flag manifold.

Uritsky","Predictability of price movements in deregulated electricity markets","15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables",,,,"q-fin.ST physics.data-an physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we investigate predictability of electricity prices in the
Canadian provinces of Alberta and Ontario, as well as in the US Mid-C market.
Using scale-dependent detrended fluctuation analysis, spectral analysis, and
the probability distribution analysis we show that the studied markets exhibit
strongly anti-persistent properties suggesting that their dynamics can be
predicted based on historic price records across the range of time scales from
one hour to one month. For both Canadian markets, the price movements reveal
three types of correlated behavior which can be used for forecasting. The
discovered scenarios remain the same on different time scales up to one month
as well as for on- and off- peak electricity data. These scenarios represent
sharp increases of prices and are not present in the Mid-C market due to its
lower volatility. We argue that extreme price movements in this market should
follow the same tendency as the more volatile Canadian markets. The estimated
values of the Pareto indices suggest that the prediction of these events can be
statistically stable. The results obtained provide new relevant information for
managing financial risks associated with the dynamics of electricity
derivatives over time frame exceeding one day.
