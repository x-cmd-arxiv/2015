two sequences of points $P=(p_1,\ldots, p_m)$ and $Q=(q_1,\ldots,q_n)$. In many
applications, the quality of the matching can be improved if we let $Q$ undergo
some transformation relative to $P$. In this paper we consider the problem of
finding a translation of $Q$ that brings the discrete Fr\'echet distance
between $P$ and $Q$ to a minimum. We devise an algorithm that computes the
minimum discrete Fr\'echet distance under translation in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and
runs in $O(m^3n^2(1+\log(n/m))\log(m+n))$ time, assuming $m\leq n$. This
improves a previous algorithm of Jiang et al.~\cite{JXZ08}, which runs in
$O(m^3n^3 \log(m + n))$ time.

tangent bifurcation between two formerly independent branches arises [D. Haag

they naturally tend to relax into lower energy states by developing
instabilities or by diffusion. But the actual amount of energy in such
inhomogeneities has remained unknown. In the present work the amount of energy
stored in a density gradient is calculated for several specific density
profiles in a cylindric configuration. This is of practical importance for
drift wave instability in various plasmas, and in particular in its application
in models dealing with the heating of solar corona because the instability is
accompanied with stochastic heating, so the energy contained in inhomogeneity
is effectively transformed into heat. It is shown that even for a rather
moderate increase of the density at the axis in magnetic structures in the
corona by a factor 1.5 or 3, the amount of excess energy per unit volume stored
in such a density gradient becomes several orders of magnitude greater than the
amount of total energy losses per unit volume (per second) in quiet regions in
the corona. Consequently, within the life-time of a magnetic structure such
energy losses can easily be compensated by the stochastic drift wave heating.

features. These can be peaks or dips with height quadratic in the driving
amplitude, for weak driving. For systems where inertial effects can be
disregarded, the peaks/dips are generally located at zero frequency and at the
driving frequency. The shape and intensity of the spectra very sensitively
depend on the parameters of the system dynamics. To illustrate this sensitivity
and the generality of the effect, we study three types of systems: an
overdamped Brownian particle (e.g., an optically trapped particle), a two-state
system that switches between the states at random, and a noisy threshold
detector. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical

likely white dwarfs, and one (PSR J1905+0453) is isolated. Phase-coherent
timing solutions, ranging from $\sim$1 to $\sim$3 years in length, and based on
observations from the Jodrell Bank and Arecibo telescopes, provide precise
determinations of spin, orbital, and astrometric parameters. All five pulsars
have large dispersion measures ($>100$ pc cm$^{-3}$, within the top 20% of all
known Galactic field MSPs) and are faint (1.4 GHz flux density < 0.1 mJy,
within the faintest 5% of all known Galactic field MSPs), illustrating PALFA's
ability to find increasingly faint, distant MSPs in the Galactic plane. In
particular, PSR J1850+0244 has a dispersion measure of 540 pc cm$^{-3}$, the
highest of all known MSPs. Such distant, faint MSPs are important input for
accurately modeling the total Galactic MSP population.

spectroscopy performed by the Gemini South telescope. Among the candidates, we

nanomechanical resonator. We first discuss how to quantify the nonlinearity of
this system and then show that the nonclassicality of the ground state, as
measured by the volume occupied by the negative part of the Wigner function,
monotonically increases with the nonlinearity in all the working regimes
addressed in our study. Our results show quantitatively that nonlinearity is a
resource to create nonclassical states in mechanical systems.

appropriate flux at high temperatures and then crystallizing under
supersaturation controlled by cooling or evaporating the flux. A refractory
crucible is generally used to contain the high temperature melt. The reaction
between the melt and crucible materials can modify the composition of the melt,
which typically results in growth failure, or contaminates the crystals. Thus
one principle in designing a flux growth is to select suitable flux and
crucible materials thus to avoid any reaction between them. In this paper, we
review two cases of flux growth in which the reaction between flux and
Al$_2$O$_3$ crucible tunes the oxygen content in the melt and helps the
crystallization of desired compositions. For the case of La$_5$Pb$_3$O,
Al$_2$O$_3$ crucible oxidizes La to form a passivating La$_2$O$_3$ layer which
not only prevents further oxidization of La in the melt but also provides [O]
to the melt. For the case of La$_{0.4}$Na$_{0.6}$Fe$_2$As$_2$, it is believed
that the Al$_2$O$_3$ crucible reacts with NaAsO$_2$ and the reaction consumes
oxygen in the melt thus maintaining an oxygen-free environment.

the vectorial nature of the coupling of spins to superconducting wires. We
present explicit numerical calculations of the flux noise power (spectral
density integrated over all frequencies) for electron impurities and lattice
nuclear spins under several different assumptions. The noise power is shown to
be dominated by surface electron spins near the wire edges, with bulk lattice
nuclear spins contributing $\sim 5$% of the noise power in aluminum and niobium
wires. We consider the role of electron spin phase transitions, showing that
the spin-spin correlation length (describing e.g. the average size of
ferromagnetic spin clusters) greatly impacts the scaling of flux noise with
wire geometry. Remarkably, flux noise power is exactly equal to zero when the
spins are polarized along the flux vector direction, forming what we call a
poloidal state. Flux noise is non-zero for other spin textures, but gets
reduced in the presence of correlated ferromagnetic fluctuations between the
top and bottom wire surfaces, where the flux vectors are antiparallel. This
demonstrates that engineering spin textures and/or inter-surface correlation
provides a method to reduce flux noise in superconducting devices.

electron attachment is developed and applied to the negative molecular ions

already been observed in the interstellar space. Cross sections and rate
coefficients for formation of these ions by radiative electron attachment to
the corresponding neutral radicals are calculated. For completeness of the
theoretical approach, two pathways for the process have been considered: (i) A
direct pathway, in which the electron in collision with the molecule
spontaneously emits a photon and forms a negative ion in one of the lowest
vibrational levels, and (ii) an indirect, or two-step pathway, in which the
electron is initially captured through non-Born-Oppenheimer coupling into a
vibrationally resonant excited state of the anion, which then stabilizes by
radiative decay. We develop a general model to describe the second pathway and
show that its contribution to the formation of cosmic anions is small in
comparison to the direct mechanism. The obtained rate coefficients at 30~K are
$7\times 10^{-16}$cm$^3$/s for CN$^-$, $7\times 10^{-17}$cm$^3$/s for
C$_2$H$^-$, and $2\times 10^{-16}$cm$^3$/s for C$_4$H$^-$. These rates weakly
depend on temperature between 10K and 100 K. The validity of our calculations

colonoscopists find it difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the
colonoscope tip in relation to polyps reported on CTC. This can cause unduly
prolonged OC examinations that are stressful for the patient, colonoscopist and
supporting staff.
  We developed a method, based on monocular 3D reconstruction from OC images,
that automatically matches polyps observed in OC with polyps reported on prior
CTC. A matching cost is computed, using rigid point-based registration between
surface point clouds extracted from both modalities. A 3D printed and painted
phantom of a 25 cm long transverse colon segment was used to validate the
method on two medium sized polyps. Results indicate that the matching cost is
smaller at the correct corresponding polyp between OC and CTC: the value is 3.9
times higher at the incorrect polyp, comparing the correct match between polyps
to the incorrect match. Furthermore, we evaluate the matching of the
reconstructed polyp from OC with other colonic endoluminal surface structures
such as haustral folds and show that there is a minimum at the correct polyp
from CTC.
  Automated matching between polyps observed at OC and prior CTC would
facilitate the biopsy or removal of true-positive pathology or exclusion of
false-positive CTC findings, and would reduce colonoscopy false-negative
(missed) polyps. Ultimately, such a method might reduce healthcare costs,
patient inconvenience and discomfort.

applications. In this paper we show how it arises in the context of category
theory using categories enriched over the extended real numbers $\overline{

profunctor' construction. The pairing between a vector space and its dual can
be viewed as an $\overline {\mathbb{R}}$-profunctor; the construction of the
nucleus of this profunctor is the construction of a lot of the theory of the
Legendre-Fenchel transform. For a relation between sets viewed as a
$\{\mathrm{true},\mathrm{false}\}$-valued profunctor, the construction of the
nucleus is the construction of the Galois connection associated to the
relation.
  One insight given by this approach is that the relevant structure on the
function spaces involved in the Legendre-Fenchel transform is something like a
metric but is asymmetric and can take negative values. This '$\overline
{\mathbb{R}}$-structure' is a considerable refinement of the usual partial
order on real-valued function space and it allows a natural interpretation of

$\textrm{Rb}_2$ molecules are trapped in the lowest Bloch band of a 3D optical
lattice. Their polarizability is determined by lattice modulation spectroscopy
which measures the potential depth for a given light intensity. Moreover, we
investigate the decay of molecules in the optical lattice, where lifetimes of
more than $2\:\textrm{s}$ are observed. In addition, the dynamical
polarizability for the $\mathrm{X}^1\Sigma_g^+$ state is calculated. We provide
simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for
$\alpha(\omega)$ for all vibrational levels of $\mathrm{a}^3\Sigma_u^+$ as well

is essential for designing experiments with ultracold molecules as lifetimes
and lattice depths are key parameters. Specifically the wavelength at
$\sim1064\:\textrm{nm}$ is of interest, since here, ultrastable high power

appropriate for the Large Magellanic Cloud. We use a one-dimensional
hydrodynamic stellar evolution code, which accounts for rotation, transport of
angular momentum by magnetic fields, and stellar wind mass loss to compute our
detailed models. We calculate stellar evolution models with initial masses of
70-500 Msun and with initial surface rotational velocities of 0-550 km/s,
covering the core-hydrogen burning phase of evolution. We find our rapid
rotators to be strongly influenced by rotationally induced mixing of helium,
with quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution occurring for the fastest rotating
models. Above 160 Msun, homogeneous evolution is also established through mass
loss, producing pure helium stars at core hydrogen exhaustion independent of
the initial rotation rate. Surface nitrogen enrichment is also found for slower
rotators, even for stars that lose only a small fraction of their initial mass.
For models above 150 MZAMS, and for models in the whole considered mass range
later on, we find a considerable envelope inflation due to the proximity of
these models to their Eddington limit. This leads to a maximum zero-age main
sequence surface temperature of 56000 K, at 180 Msun, and to an evolution of
stars in the mass range 50-100 Msun to the regime of luminous blue variables in
the HR diagram with high internal Eddington factors. Inflation also leads to
decreasing surface temperatures during the chemically homogeneous evolution of
stars above 180 Msun. The cool surface temperatures due to the envelope
inflation in our models lead to an enhanced mass loss, which prevents stars at
LMC metallicity from evolving into pair-instability supernovae. The
corresponding spin-down will also prevent very massive LMC stars to produce
long-duration gamma-ray bursts, which might, however, originate from lower
masses.

tendency to ""self clear"", demonstrated by negative autocorrelation around the
central peak. This does not occur in the north polar region. In the south polar
region, dust and ice are temporally and spatially anti correlated. In the north
polar region, this relationship is reversed, however temporal correlation of
northern dust and ice clouds is weak - 6 times weaker than the anticorrelation
in the south polar region. Our latitudinal autocorrelation functions allow us
to put average spatial sizes of event cores and halos. Dust events in the south
are largest, affecting almost the entire pole, whereas dust storms are smaller
in the north. Ice clouds in north are similar in latitudinal extent to those in
the south (both have halos < 10{\deg}). Using cross-correlation functions of
water ice and dust, we find that dust events temporally lag ice events by 35-80
degrees of solar longitude in the north and south poles, which is likely due to
seasonality of dust and ice events.

tension on a spherical surface of radius
$R_0=3R\sqrt{1-\frac{8}{9}\frac{R}{R_s}}$. For $r < R_0$ the interior

localized at the Schwarzschild radius itself, $R_0=R_s$, and the solution has
constant negative pressure $p =-\bar\rho$ everywhere in the interior $r<R_s$,
thereby describing a gravitational condensate star, a fully collapsed
non-singular state already inherent in and predicted by classical General
Relativity. The redshifted surface tension of the condensate star surface is
given by $\tau_s=\Delta\kappa/8\pi G$, where
$\Delta\kappa=\kappa_+-\kappa_-=2\kappa_+=1/R_s$ is the difference of equal and
opposite surface gravities between the exterior and interior Schwarzschild
solutions. The First Law, $dM=dE_v+\tau_s dA$ is recognized as a purely
mechanical classical relation at zero temperature and zero entropy, describing
the volume energy and surface energy change respectively. Since there is no
event horizon, the Schwarzschild time t of such a non-singular gravitational
condensate star is a global time, fully consistent with unitary time evolution
in quantum theory. The $p=-\bar\rho$ interior acts as a defocusing lens for
light passing through the condensate, leading to imaging characteristics
distinguishable from a classical black hole. A further observational test of
gravitational condensate stars with a physical surface vs. black holes is the
discrete surface modes of oscillation which should be detectable by their

with ages < 1 Gyr and with binary companions <100 AU, to rule out possible
correlations due to effects other than planet presence. In our sample of 204
FGK stars, we do not find evidence that debris disks are more common or more
dusty around stars harboring high-mass or low-mass planets compared to a
control sample without identified planets, nor that debris disks are more or
less common (or more or less dusty) around stars harboring multiple planets
compared to single-planet systems. Diverse dynamical histories may account for
the lack of correlations. The data show the correlation between the presence of
high-mass planets and stellar metallicity, but no correlation between the
presence of low-mass planets or debris and stellar metallicity. Comparing the
observed cumulative distribution of fractional luminosity to those expected
from a Gaussian distribution, we find that a distribution centered on the Solar
system's value fits well the data, while one centered at 10 times this value
can be rejected. This is of interest in the context of future terrestrial
planet characterization because it indicates that there are good prospects for
finding a large number of debris disk systems (i.e. with evidence of harboring

which has two planar shocks with shock compression ratio that depend on the
angle defect of the string and its speed. The shocks result in compression and
heating of the gas and, given favorable condition, particle acceleration. The
gas heating and overdensity in an unusual wedge shape can be detected by
observing HI line at high redshifts. The particle acceleration can occur in
present-day Universe when the string crosses the hot gas contained in galaxy
clusters and, since the consequences of such collision persist for cosmological
timescales, could be located by looking at the unusual large-scale radio
sources situated on a single spatial plane.

simulations that allows quantitative analysis of the stochastic late stages of
planet formation. We quantify the feeding zone width, Delta a, as the
mass-weighted standard deviation of the initial semi-major axes of the
planetary embryos and planetesimals that make up the final planet. The size of
a planet's feeding zone in our simulations does not correlate with its final
mass or semi-major axis, suggesting there is no systematic trend between a
planet's mass and its volatile inventory. Instead, we find that the feeding
zone of any planet more massive than 0.1M_Earth is roughly proportional to the
radial extent of the initial disk from which it formed: Delta
a~0.25(a_max-a_min), where a_min and a_max are the inner and outer edge of the
initial planetesimal disk. These wide stochastic feeding zones have significant
consequences for the origin of the Moon, since the canonical scenario predicts
the Moon should be primarily composed of material from Earth's last major
impactor (Theia), yet its isotopic composition is indistinguishable from Earth.
In particular, we find that the feeding zones of Theia analogs are
significantly more stochastic than the planetary analogs. Depending on our
assumed initial distribution of oxygen isotopes within the planetesimal disk,
we find a ~5% or less probability that the Earth and Theia will form with an
isotopic difference equal to or smaller than the Earth and Moon's. In fact we
predict that every planetary mass body should be expected to have a unique
isotopic signature. In addition, we find paucities of massive Theia analogs and
high velocity moon-forming collisions, two recently proposed explanations for
the Moon's isotopic composition. Our work suggests that there is still no
scenario for the Moon's origin that explains its isotopic composition with a
high probability event.

a simple analytical description of ram-pressure stripping in the simulations to
identify the regions in phase-space where galaxies are more likely to have been
sufficiently stripped of their HI gas to fall below the detection limit of our
survey. We find a striking agreement between the model predictions and the
observed location of HI-detected and non-detected blue (late-type) galaxies in
phase-space, strongly implying that ram-pressure plays a key role in the gas
removal from galaxies, and that this can happen during their first infall into
the cluster. However, we also find a significant number of gas-poor, red
(early-type) galaxies in the infall region of the cluster that cannot easily be
explained with our model of ram-pressure stripping alone. We discuss different
possible additional mechanisms that could be at play, including the
pre-processing of galaxies in their previous environment. Our results are
strengthened by the distribution of galaxy colours (optical and UV) in
phase-space, that suggests that after a (gas-rich) field galaxy falls into the

into the cluster, its star formation will decay until it is completely

anisotropy in the measured clustering signal as a function of the angle to the

this measurement include our ability to model non-linear galaxy motions on
small scales and the complexities of galaxy bias. The anisotropy in the
measured clustering pattern in redshift-space is also driven by the unknown
distance factors at the redshift in question, the Alcock-Paczynski distortion.
This weakens growth rate measurements, but permits an extra geometric probe of
the Hubble expansion rate. In this chapter we will briefly describe the

using observations of distant supernovae. In this light, the SKA enables us to
do an ultimate test in cosmology by measuring the expansion rate of the
Universe in real time. This can be done by a rather simple experiment of
observing the neutral hydrogen (HI) signal of galaxies at two different epochs.
The signal will encounter a change in frequency imprinted as the Universe
expands over time and thus monitoring the drift in frequencies will provide a
real time measure of the cosmic acceleration. Over a period of 12 years one
would expected a frequency shift of the order of 0.1 Hz assuming a standard
Lambda-CDM cosmology. Based on the sensitivity estimates of the SKA and the
number counts of the expected HI galaxies, it is shown that the number counts
are sufficiently high to compensate for the observational uncertainties of the
measurements and hence allow a statistical detection of the frequency shift.

LINERs; and (2) the disappearance of the dusty torus in LINERs predicted from
theoretical arguments. We have compiled all the available low spectral

complemented this sample with Spitzer/IRS spectra of PGQSOs, S1s, S2s, and SBs
nuclei. We have studied the AGN versus the starburst content in our sample
using different indicators: the EW(PAH 6.2um), the strength of the silicate
feature at 9.7um, and the steepness of the mid-IR spectra. In 25 out of the 40
LINERs (i.e., 62.5%) the mid-IR spectra are not SB-dominated, similar to the
comparison S2 sample (67.7%). The average spectra of both SB-dominated LINERs
and S2s are very similar to the average spectrum of the SB class. Moreover, the
average spectrum of AGN-dominated LINERs with Lx(2-10keV)>10E+41 erg/s is
similar to the average mid-IR spectrum of AGN-dominated S2s. However, faint
LINERs show flat spectra different from any of the other optical classes,
suggesting the disappearance of the dusty torus. The correlation between
nuLnu(12um) and Lx(2-10keV) for AGN nicely extends toward low luminosities only
if SB-dominated LINERs are excluded and Lx(2-10keV) is corrected in
Compton-thick LINER candidates. We discuss the nature of faint LINERs by
comparing it with the spectra of several emission mechanisms like jet, ADAF,
planetary nebulae, or post-AGB stars. We suggest that the material producing
the Compton-thick X-ray obscuration is free of dust, to reconcile the

is inclined relative to the binary orbital axis. We also analyze the case of
Cygnus X-3 and show that jet bending is likely negligible unless the jet is
significantly less powerful or much wider than currently thought. Our numerical
investigation is limited to isotropic stellar winds. We discuss the possible
effect of wind clumping on jet-wind interaction, which are likely significant,

limited by $1/f$ noise and thermal drifts, which become the dominant

existence of a tiny and rigid cosmological constant, $\Lambda$. Its size is
many orders of magnitude below the expected one in the standard model of

static vacuum energy density. We should rather observe a mildly dynamical
behavior $\delta\Lambda(t)\sim R\sim H^2(t)$ with the expansion rate $H$. At
the same time, it is natural to think that the huge value of the primeval
vacuum energy (presumably connected to some grand unified theory) was
responsible for the initial inflationary phase. In the traditional inflaton
models such phase is inserted by hand in the early epoch of the cosmic
evolution, and it is assumed to match the concordance $\Lambda$CDM regime
during the radiation epoch. Here, instead, we consider a class of dynamical
vacuum models which incorporate into a single vacuum structure
$\bar{\Lambda}(H)$ the rapid stage of inflation, followed by the radiation and
cold matter epochs, until achieving our dark energy Universe. The early
behavior of the model bares resemblance with Starobinsky's inflation and
ptovides a solution to the large entropy problem. It is compatible with the

precision of Hubble Space Telescope photometry, was that some intermediate age
(1-2 Gyr) clusters in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds have main sequence
turn-off (MSTO) widths that are significantly broader than would be expected
for a simple stellar population (SSP). One interpretation of these extended
MSTOs (eMSTOs) is that age spreads of the order of ~500 Myr exist within the
clusters, radically redefining our view of stellar clusters, which are
traditionally thought of as single age, single metallicity stellar populations.
Here we test this interpretation by studying other regions of the CMD that
should also be affected by such large age spreads, namely the width of the
sub-giant branch (SGB) and the red clump (RC). We study two massive clusters in
the LMC that display the eMSTO phenomenon (NGC 1806 & NGC 1846) and show that
both have SGB and RC morphologies that are in conflict with expectations if
large age spreads exist within the clusters. We conclude that the SGB and RC
widths are inconsistent with extended star-formation histories within these
clusters, hence age spreads are not likely to be the cause of the eMSTO
phenomenon. Our results are in agreement with recent studies that also have
cast doubt on whether large age spreads can exist in massive clusters; namely
the failure to find age spreads in young massive clusters, a lack of gas/dust
detected within massive clusters, and homogeneous abundances within clusters
that exhibit the eMSTO phenomenon.

$E_{\rm des}$, is an important controlling parameter in gas-grain models; its
value impacts the temperature range over which oxygen resides on a dust grain.
However, no prior measurement has been done of the desorption energy. We report
the first direct measurement of $E_{\rm des}$ for atomic oxygen from dust grain
analogs. The values of $E_{\rm des}$ are $1660\pm 60$~K and $1850\pm 90$~K for
porous amorphous water ice and for a bare amorphous silicate film,
respectively, or about twice the value previously adopted in simulations of the
chemical evolution of a cloud. We use the new values to study oxygen chemistry
as a function of depth in a molecular cloud. For $n=10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and
$G_0$=10$^2$ ($G_0$=1 is the average local interstellar radiation field), the
main result of the adoption of the higher oxygen binding energy is that H$_2$O
can form on grains at lower visual extinction $A_{\rm V}$, closer to the cloud
surface. A higher binding energy of O results in more formation of OH and
H$_2$O on grains, which are subsequently desorbed by FUV radiation, with
consequences for gas-phase chemistry. For higher values of $n$ and $G_0$, the
higher binding energy can lead to a large increase in the column of H$_2$O but
a decrease in the column of O$_2$.

supersonic flow of dense magnetized plasma past non-magnetic objects. A hybrid
electrostatic Boltzmann electron treatment is first used to investigate the ion
stability in the absence of kinetic electron effects, showing that the ions are
two-stream unstable for downstream wake distances (in lunar radii) greater than
about three times the solar wind Mach number. Simulations with PIC electrons
are then used to show that kinetic electron effects can lead to disruption of
the ion beams at least three times closer to the moon than in the hybrid

the non-linear growth of electron holes spawned from a narrow dimple in the
electron velocity distribution. Most of the holes arising from the dimple are
small and quickly leave the wake, approximately following the unperturbed
electron phase-space trajectories, but some holes originating near the center
of the wake remain and grow large enough to trigger disruption of the ion
beams. Non-linear kinetic-electron effects are therefore essential to a
comprehensive understanding of the 1D electrostatic stability of such wakes,

regions of turbulence. The `centrifuge mechanism' of Maxey (\emph{J. Fluid
Mech.} \textbf{174}:441--65, 1987) appears to explain this phenomenon. In a
recent paper, Bragg \& Collins (\emph{New J. Phys.} \textbf{16}:055013, 2014)
showed that the centrifuge mechanism is dominant only in the regime ${St\ll1}$,
where $St$ is the Stokes number based on the Kolmogorov time scale. Outside
this regime, the centrifuge mechanism gives way to a non-local, path-history
symmetry breaking mechanism. However, despite the change in the clustering
mechanism, the instantaneous particle positions continue to correlate with
high-strain, low-rotation regions of the turbulence. In this paper, we analyze
the exact equation governing the radial distribution function and show how the
non-local clustering mechanism is influenced by, but not dependent upon, the
preferential sampling of the fluid velocity gradient tensor along the particle
path-histories in such a way as to generate a bias for clustering in
high-strain regions of the turbulence. We also show how the non-local mechanism
still generates clustering, but without preferential concentration, in the
limit where the timescales of the fluid velocity gradient tensor measured along
the inertial particle trajectories approaches zero (such as white-noise flows
or for particles in turbulence settling under strong gravity). Finally, we use
data from a direct numerical simulation of inertial particles suspended in
Navier-Stokes turbulence to validate the arguments presented in this study.

Lorentz boosts while preserving at large distances some form of spatial
translations, time-translations, and possibly spatial rotations. Surprisingly,
the simplest, most minimal system achieving this symmetry breaking
pattern---the ""framid""---does not seem to be realized in Nature. Instead,
Nature usually adopts a more cumbersome strategy: that of introducing internal
translational symmetries---and possibly rotational ones---and of spontaneously
breaking them along with their space-time counterparts, while preserving
unbroken diagonal subgroups. This symmetry breaking pattern describes the
infrared dynamics of ordinary solids, fluids, superfluids, and---if they
exist---supersolids. A third, ""extra-ordinary"", possibility involves replacing
these internal symmetries with other symmetries that do not commute with the
Poincar\'e group, for instance the galileon symmetry, supersymmetry or gauge
symmetries. Among these options, we pick the systems based on the galileon
symmetry, the ""galileids"", for a more detailed study. Despite some similarity,
all different patterns produce truly distinct physical systems with different
observable properties. For instance, the low-energy $2\to 2$ scattering
amplitudes for the Goldstone excitations in the cases of framids, solids and
galileids scale respectively as $E^2$, $E^4$, and $E^6$. Similarly the energy
momentum tensor in the ground state is ""trivial"" for framids ($\rho +p=0$),
normal for solids ($\rho+p>0$) and even inhomogenous for galileids.

show that the Dark Energy figures of merit obtained individually from WGL/LSS

increased knowledge of galaxy bias as a function of redshift as well as the
extra information from the different cosmological dependences of the

these same photometric redshifts, and their scatter, to high accuracy by
modelling them as nuisance parameters and fitting them simultaneously

main source of nonelementary complexity of deciding WS1S formulae. Our approach
is applicable within the state-of-the-art automata-based WS1S decision
procedure implemented, e.g. in MONA. The way in which the standard decision
procedure processes quantifiers involves determinization, with its worst case
exponential complexity, for every quantifier alternation in the prefix of a
formula. Our algorithm avoids building the deterministic automata---instead, it
constructs only those of their states needed for (dis)proving validity of the
formula. It uses a symbolic representation of the states, which have a deeply
nested structure stemming from the repeated implicit subset construction, and
prunes the search space by a nested subsumption relation, a generalization of
the one used by the so-called antichain algorithms for handling
nondeterministic automata. We have obtained encouraging experimental results,
in some cases outperforming MONA by several orders of magnitude.

based on a recursive peeling procedure that uses a specific survival peeling
criterion derived from non/semi-parametric statistics such as the
hazards-ratio, the log-rank test or the Nelson-Aalen estimator. To optimize the
tuning parameter of the model and validate it, we introduce an objective
function based on survival or prediction-error statistics, such as the log-rank

importance of replicated cross-validation and the differences between criteria

non-parametric survival models exist, none addresses the problem of directly
identifying local extrema. We show how SBH efficiently estimates extreme
survival/risk subgroups unlike other models. This provides an insight into the
behavior of commonly used models and suggests alternatives to be adopted in
practice. Finally, our SBH framework was applied to a clinical dataset. In it,
we identified subsets of patients characterized by clinical and demographic

The present model does not suffer from the spurious term caused by the
forcing-term effect, which was encountered in some previous thermal LB models
for liquid-vapor phase change. Using the model, the liquid-vapor boiling
process is simulated. The boiling curve together with the three boiling stages
(nucleate boiling, transition boiling, and film boiling) is numerically
reproduced in the LB community for the first time. The numerical results show
that the basic features and the fundamental characteristics of boiling heat
transfer are well captured, such as the severe fluctuation of transient heat
flux in the transition boiling and the feature that the maximum heat transfer
coefficient lies at a lower wall superheat than that of the maximum heat flux.
Furthermore, the effects of the heating surface wettability on boiling heat
transfer are investigated. It is found that an increase in contact angle
promotes the onset of boiling but reduces the critical heat flux, and makes the
boiling process enter into the film boiling regime at a lower wall superheat,
which is consistent with the findings from experimental studies.

  tomography in heterogeneous media",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a numerical study on a fast marching method based back
projection reconstruction algorithm for photoacoustic tomography in
heterogeneous media. Transcranial imaging is used here as a case study. To
correct for the phase aberration from the heterogeneity (i.e., skull), the fast
marching method is adopted to compute the phase delay based on the known speed
of sound distribution, and the phase delay is taken into account by the back
projection algorithm for more accurate reconstructions. It is shown that the
proposed algorithm is more accurate than the conventional back projection
algorithm, but slightly less accurate than the time reversal algorithm
particularly in the area close to the skull. However, the image reconstruction
time for the proposed algorithm can be as little as 124 ms when implemented by
a GPU (512 sensors, 21323 pixels reconstructed), which is two orders of
magnitude faster than the time reversal reconstruction. The proposed algorithm,
therefore, not only corrects for the phase aberration, but can be also
potentially implemented in a real-time manner.

comet 313P/Gibbs. We find that the object is clearly active both in
observations obtained in 2014 and in precovery observations obtained in 2003 by
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, strongly suggesting that its activity is
sublimation-driven. This conclusion is supported by a photometric analysis
showing an increase in the total brightness of the comet over the 2014
observing period, and dust modeling results showing that the dust emission
persists over at least three months during both active periods, where we find
start dates for emission no later than 2003 July 24+/-10 for the 2003 active
period and 2014 July 28+/-10 for the 2014 active period. From serendipitous
observations by the Subaru Telescope in 2004 when the object was apparently
inactive, we estimate that the nucleus has an absolute R-band magnitude of
H_R=17.1+/-0.3, corresponding to an effective nucleus radius of r_e~1.00+/-0.15
km. The object's faintness at that time means we cannot rule out the presence
of activity, and so this computed radius should be considered an upper limit.
We find that 313P's orbit is intrinsically chaotic, having a Lyapunov time of
T_l=12000 yr and being located near two 3-body mean-motion resonances with
Jupiter and Saturn, 11J-1S-5A and 10J+12S-7A, yet appears stable over >50 Myr
in an apparent example of stable chaos. We furthermore find that 313P is the
second main-belt comet, after P/2012 T1 (PANSTARRS), to belong to the ~155 Myr
old Lixiaohua asteroid family.

method is definitely an important supplement to the other geometric
measurements and will play a crucial role in cosmological constraints. In this
paper, we quantify the ability of SL test signal by a CODEX-like spectrograph
for constraining interacting dark energy. Four typical interacting dark energy
models are considered: (i) $Q=\gamma H\rho_c$, (ii) $Q=\gamma H\rho_{de}$,
(iii) $Q=\gamma H_0\rho_c$, and (iv) $Q=\gamma H_0\rho_{de}$. The results show
that for all the considered interacting dark energy models, relative to the
current joint SN+BAO+CMB+$H_0$ observations, the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and
$H_0$ would be improved by about 60\% and 30--40\%, while the constraints on
$w$ and $\gamma$ would be slightly improved, with a 30-yr observation of SL
test. We also explore the impact of SL test on future joint geometric
observations. In this analysis, we take the model with $Q=\gamma H\rho_c$ as an
example, and simulate future SN and BAO data based on the space-based project
WFIRST. We find that in the future geometric constraints, the redshift drift
observations would help break the geometric degeneracies in a meaningful way,
thus the measurement precisions of $\Omega_m$, $H_0$, $w$, and $\gamma$ could
be substantially improved using future probes.

specific thermostat types, Hoover-Holian, Ju-Bulgac, and
Martyna-Klein-Tuckerman, have very similar Lyapunov spectra in their
equilibrium four-dimensional phase spaces and when coupled in equilibrium or
nonequilibrium pairs. All three of these oscillator-based thermostats are shown
to be ergodic, with smooth analytic Gaussian distributions in their extended
phase spaces ( coordinate, momentum, and two control variables ). Evidently
these three ergodic and time-reversible thermostat types are particularly
useful as statistical-mechanical thermometers and thermostats. Each of them
generates Gibbs' universal canonical distribution internally as well as for
systems to which they are coupled. Thus they obey the Zeroth Law of
Thermodynamics, as a good heat bath should. They also provide dissipative heat
flow with relatively small nonlinearity when two or more such bath temperatures
interact and provide useful deterministic replacements for the stochastic
Langevin equation.

stellar light in a single visible-wavelength band. In addition to detection,
the precise photometry provides phase curves of exoplanets, which can be used
to study the dynamic processes on these planets. However, the interpretation of
these observations can be complicated by the fact that visible-wavelength phase
curves can represent both thermal emission and scattering from the planets.
Here we present a semi-analytical model framework that can be applied to study
Kepler and future visible-wavelength phase curve observations of exoplanets.
The model efficiently computes reflection and thermal emission components for
both rocky and gaseous planets, considering both homogeneous and inhomogeneous
surfaces or atmospheres. We analyze the phase curves of the gaseous planet
Kepler-7 b and the rocky planet Kepler-10 b using the model. In general, we
find that a hot exoplanet's visible-wavelength phase curve having a significant
phase offset can usually be explained by two classes of solutions: one class
requires a thermal hot spot shifted to one side of the substellar point, and
the other class requires reflective clouds concentrated on the same side of the
substellar point. The two solutions would require very different Bond albedos
to fit the same phase curve; atmospheric circulation models or eclipse
observations at longer wavelengths can effectively rule out one class of
solutions, and thus pinpoint the albedo of the planet, allowing decomposition
of the reflection and the thermal emission components in the phase curve.
Particularly for Kepler-7 b, reflective clouds located on the west side of the
substellar point can best explain its phase curve. We further derive that the
reflectivity of the clear part of the atmosphere should be less than 7% and
that of the cloudy part should be greater than 80% (abridged)

perform robust patch-based denoising of images by generalizing the popular

and the method of augmented Lagrangian. The attractive feature of this approach
is that the subproblems involved in the ADMM-based optimization of the

shown to exhibit faster convergence compared to an existing solver.

wavelengths where many highly resolved galaxy images are readily available.
However, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) holds great promise for this type of
measurement at radio wavelengths owing to its greatly increased sensitivity and
resolution over typical radio surveys. The key to successful weak lensing
experiments is in measuring the shapes of detected sources to high accuracy. In
this document we describe a simulation pipeline designed to simulate radio
images of the quality required for weak lensing, and will be typical of SKA
observations. We provide as input, images with realistic galaxy shapes which
are then simulated to produce images as they would have been observed with a
given radio interferometer. We exploit this pipeline to investigate various
stages of a weak lensing experiment in order to better understand the effects
that may impact shape measurement. We first show how the proposed SKA1-Mid
array configurations perform when we compare the (known) input and output
ellipticities. We then investigate how making small changes to these array
configurations impact on this input-outut ellipticity comparison. We also
demonstrate how alternative configurations for SKA1-Mid that are smaller in
extent, and with a faster survey speeds produce similar performance to those
originally proposed. We then show how a notional SKA configuration performs in
the same shape measurement challenge. Finally, we describe ongoing efforts to
utilise our simulation pipeline to address questions relating to how applicable
current (mostly originating from optical data) shape measurement techniques are
to future radio surveys. As an alternative to such image plane techniques, we
lastly discuss a shape measurement technique based on the shapelets formalism

while for muons this effect should be taken into account. For the longitudinal

chiral current which is called the chiral electric separation effect (CESE). We
propose two possible observables for CESE in Cu + Au collisions: The first one
is the correlation $\zeta_{\alpha\beta}=\langle
\cos[2(\phi_\alpha+\phi_\beta-2\Psi_{\rm RP})]\rangle$; the second one is the
charge-dependent event-plane angle $\Psi^{q}_2$ with $q=\pm$ being charge.
Nonzero $\Delta\zeta=\zeta_{opp}-\zeta_{same}$ and
$\Delta\Psi=\langle|\Psi_2^+-\Psi_2^-|\rangle$ may signal the CESE in Cu + Au
collisions. Within a multiphase transport model, we study how the final state
interaction affects these observables. We find that the correlation
$\gamma_{\alpha\beta}=\langle\cos(\phi_{\alpha}+\phi_{\beta}-\Psi_{\rm
RP})\rangle$ is sensitive to the out-of-plane charge separation caused by the
chiral magnetic effect and to the in-plane charge separation caused by the
in-plane electric field, but it is not sensitive to the CESE. On the other
hand, $\Delta\zeta$ and $\Delta\Psi$ are sensitive to the CESE. Therefore, we
suggest that the future experiments measure the above observables in Cu+Au
collisions in order to disentangle different chiral and charge separation
mechanisms.

parameterization of sources in 3D spectral-line datasets. SoFiA combines for
the first time in a single piece of software a set of new source-finding and
parameterization algorithms developed on the way to future HI surveys with
ASKAP (WALLABY, DINGO) and APERTIF. It is designed to enable the general use of
these new algorithms by the community on a broad range of datasets. The key
advantages of SoFiA are the ability to: search for line emission on multiple
scales to detect 3D sources in a complete and reliable way, taking into account
noise level variations and the presence of artefacts in a data cube; estimate
the reliability of individual detections; look for signal in arbitrarily large
data cubes using a catalogue of 3D coordinates as a prior; provide a wide range
of source parameters and output products which facilitate further analysis by
the user. We highlight the modularity of SoFiA, which makes it a flexible
package allowing users to select and apply only the algorithms useful for their
data and science questions. This modularity makes it also possible to easily
expand SoFiA in order to include additional methods as they become available.
The full SoFiA distribution, including a dedicated graphical user interface, is

  and its application to a Markov modulated two dimensional reflecting process","To appear in Queueing Systems",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Markov modulation is versatile in generalization for making a simple
stochastic model which is often analytically tractable to be more flexible in
application. In this spirit, we modulate a two dimensional reflecting skip-free
random walk in such a way that its state transitions in the boundary faces and
interior of a nonnegative integer quadrant are controlled by Markov chains.
This Markov modulated model is referred to as a 2d-QBD process according to
Ozaw (2013). We are interested in the tail asymptotics of its stationary
distribution, which has been well studied when there is no Markov modulation.
  Ozawa studied this tail asymptotics problem, but his answer is not
analytically tractable. We think this is because Markov modulation is so free
to change a model even if the state space for Markov modulation is finite.
Thus, some structure, say, extra conditions, would be needed to make the Markov
modulation analytically tractable while minimizing its limitation in
application.
  The aim of this paper is to investigate such structure for the tail
asymptotic problem. For this, we study the existence of a right subinvariant
positive vector, called a superharmonic vector, of a nonnegative matrix with
QBD block structure, where each block matrix is finite dimensional. We
characterize this existence under a certain extra assumption. We apply this
characterization to the 2d-QBD process, and derive the tail decay rates of its
marginal stationary distribution in an arbitrary direction. This solves the
tail decay rate problem for a two node generalized Jackson network, which has
been open for many years.

powerful tools for quantum technologies. A major objective for such interfaces
is high fidelity storage and retrieval of a photon in a collective quantum
state of many atoms. This requires long-lived collective superposition states,
which is typically achieved with immobilized atoms. Thermal atomic vapors,
which present a simple and scalable resource, have, so far, only been used for
continuous variable processing or for discrete variable processing on short
time scales where atomic motion is negligible. We develop a theory based on the
concept of motional averaging to enable room temperature discrete variable
quantum memories and coherent single photon sources. We show that by choosing
the interaction time so that atoms kept under spin protecting conditions can
cross the light beam several times during the interaction combined with
suitable spectral filtering, we erase the ""which atom"" information and obtain
an efficient and homogenous coupling between all atoms and the light. Heralded
single excitations can thus be created and stored as collective spinwaves,
which can later be read out to produce coherent single photons in a scalable
fashion. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to scalable quantum
memories with a proof-of-principle experiment with room temperature atoms
contained in microcells with spin protecting coating, placed inside an optical
cavity. The experiment is performed at conditions corresponding to a few
photons per pulse and clearly demonstrates a long coherence time of the forward
scattered photons, which is the essential feature of the motional averaging.

metallicity-sensitive absorption line strengths. Applying single stellar
population models, there are weak but measurable trends of the IMF with age and
abundance ratio. Accounting for the dependence of stellar population parameters
on velocity dispersion effectively removes these trends, but subsequently
introduces a trend with metallicity, such that `heavy' IMFs favour lower

optical light curves, fundamental physical parameters have been determined
together with evidence for transient maculations (spots) located near
quadrature longitudes and intermediate latitudes.
  Eclipses were observed at optical, ultraviolet and radio wavelengths.
Significant drops in 6cm radio emission near the phases of both primary and
secondary eclipse indicate relatively compact radio emitting volumes that may
lie between the binary components. IUE observations during secondary eclipse
are indicative of a uniform chromosphere saturated with MgII plage-type
emission and an extended volume of Ly$\alpha$ emission.
  Profile fitting of high-dispersion H alpha spectra confirms the chromospheric
saturation and indicates significant H$\alpha$ opacity to heights of a few
percent of the photospheric radius. There is evidence for an enhanced H alpha
emission region visible near phase 0.25-0.35 which may be associated with a
large spot on the primary and with two small optical flares which were also
observed at other wavelengths: one in microwave radiation and the other in
X-rays. For both flares, L_X/L_opt is consistent with energy release in closed
magnetic structures.

A cograph is uniquely determined by a so-called cotree. As not all graphs are

optimal cograph edge k-decomposition {E_1,...,E_k} of E so that each subgraph

(DTV) is observed 3% of the time due to occasional ionospheric or atmospheric
propagation. After RFI detection and excision, almost all data can be
calibrated and imaged without further RFI mitigation efforts, including
observations within the FM and DTV bands. The results are compared to a
previously published Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) RFI survey. The remote
location of the MWA results in a substantially cleaner RFI environment compared
to LOFAR's radio environment, but adequate detection of RFI is still required
before data can be analysed. We include specific recommendations designed to
make the SKA more robust to RFI, including: the availability of sufficient
computing power for RFI detection; accounting for RFI in the receiver design; a
smooth band-pass response; and the capability of RFI detection at high time and

energy transfer to co-doped Tb$^{3+}$ ions in the fluoride crystal. We report
the growth technique, spectroscopic study and room temperature continuous wave

that of superconducting atomic H stabilized by strong covalent mixing with S 3p

nonlocal coupling, i.e. mediated by a coupling that decays with the distance
slower than an exponential. We applied this mechanism to arid ecosystems by
considering a prototype model of a Nagumo type. In one-dimension, we study the
front that connects the stable uniformly vegetated state with the bare one
under the effect of strong nonlocal coupling. We show that strong nonlocal
coupling stabilizes both---dip and peak---localized structures. We show
analytically and numerically that the width of localized dip, which we
interpret as fairy circle, increases strongly with the aridity parameter. This
prediction is in agreement with filed observations. In addition, we predict
that the width of localized patch decreases with the degree of aridity.

some conditions does not find, neither quantitatively nor qualitatively, a
satisfactory theory-based explanation. This compromise the successful
realization of thermo-nuclear fusion for energy production since its
accumulation is known to be one of the causes that leads to the plasma
breakdown. In standard reactor-relevant conditions this accumulation is in most
stellarators intrinsic to the lack of toroidal symmetry, that leads to the
neoclassical electric field to point radially inwards. This statement, that the
standard theory allows to formulate, has been contradicted by some experiments
that showed weaker or no accumulation under such conditions
\cite{Ida_pop_16_056111_2009, Yoshinuma_nf_49_062002_2009}. The charge state of
the impurities makes its transport more sensitive to the electric fields. Thus,
the short length scale turbulent electrostatic potential or its long
wave-length variation on the flux surface $\Phi_{1}$ -- that the standard
neoclassical approach usually neglects -- might possibly shed some light on the
experimental findings. In the present work the focus is put on the second of
the two, and investigate its influence of the radial transport of C$^{6+}$. We
show that in LHD it is strongly modified by $\Phi_{1}$, both resulting in
mitigated/enhanced accumulation at internal/external radial positions; for
Wendelstein 7-X, on the contrary, $\Phi_{1}$ is expected to be considerably
smaller and the transport of C$^{6+}$ not affected up to an appreciable extent;
and in TJ-II the potential shows a moderate impact despite of the large

technology that operates with a high fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.
HCCI combustion is characterized by complex nonlinear dynamics which
necessitates a model based control approach for automotive application. HCCI
engine control is a nonlinear, multi-input multi-output problem with state and
actuator constraints which makes controller design a challenging task. Typical
HCCI controllers make use of a first principles based model which involves a
long development time and cost associated with expert labor and calibration. In
this paper, an alternative approach based on machine learning is presented
using extreme learning machines (ELM) and nonlinear model predictive control
(MPC). A recurrent ELM is used to learn the nonlinear dynamics of HCCI engine
using experimental data and is shown to accurately predict the engine behavior
several steps ahead in time, suitable for predictive control. Using the ELM
engine models, an MPC based control algorithm with a simplified quadratic
program update is derived for real time implementation. The working and
effectiveness of the MPC approach has been analyzed on a nonlinear HCCI engine
model for tracking multiple reference quantities along with constraints defined
by HCCI states, actuators and operational limits.

topic in molecular biochemistry. Structure plays a critical role in defining
the function of proteins and is more strongly conserved than amino acid
sequence over evolutionary timescales. A key challenge is the identification
and evaluation of structural similarity between proteins; such analysis can aid
in understanding the role of newly discovered proteins and help elucidate
evolutionary relationships between organisms. Computational biologists have
developed many clever algorithmic techniques for comparing protein structures,
however, all are based on heuristic optimization criteria, making statistical
interpretation somewhat difficult. Here we present a fully probabilistic
framework for pairwise structural alignment of proteins. Our approach has
several advantages, including the ability to capture alignment uncertainty and
to estimate key ""gap"" parameters which critically affect the quality of the
alignment. We show that several existing alignment methods arise as maximum a
posteriori estimates under specific choices of prior distributions and error
models. Our probabilistic framework is also easily extended to incorporate
additional information, which we demonstrate by including primary sequence
information to generate simultaneous sequence-structure alignments that can
resolve ambiguities obtained using structure alone. This combined model also
provides a natural approach for the difficult task of estimating evolutionary
distance based on structural alignments. The model is illustrated by comparison
with well-established methods on several challenging protein alignment
examples.

  An example of Bishop shows that the completion of $D^{(1)}(X)$ need not be
semisimple. We show that the completion of $D^{(1)}(X)$ is semisimple whenever
the union of all the rectifiable Jordan arcs in $X$ is dense in $X$.
  We prove that the character space of $D^{(1)}(X)$ is equal to $X$ for all

insulator-to-metal transition takes place, where the extra e/2 electron at the

  full-CSI case","submitted to IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by recent discoveries of microbial communities that transfer
electrons across centimeter-length scales, this paper studies the information
capacity of bacterial cables via electron transfer, which coexists with
molecular communications, under the assumption of full causal channel state
information (CSI). The bacterial cable is modeled as an electron queue that
transfers electrons from the encoder at the electron donor source, which
controls the desired input electron intensity, to the decoder at the electron
acceptor sink. Clogging due to local ATP saturation along the cable is modeled.
A discrete-time scheme is investigated, enabling the computation of an
achievable rate. The regime of asymptotically small time-slot duration is
analyzed, and the optimality of binary input distributions is proved, i.e., the
encoder transmits at either maximum or minimum intensity, as dictated by the
physical constraints of the cable. A dynamic programming formulation of the
capacity is proposed, and the optimal binary signaling is determined via policy
iteration. It is proved that the optimal signaling has smaller intensity than
that given by the myopic policy, which greedily maximizes the instantaneous
information rate but neglects its effect on the steady-state cable
distribution. In contrast, the optimal scheme balances the tension between
achieving high instantaneous information rate, and inducing a favorable
steady-state distribution, such that those states characterized by high
information rates are visited more frequently, thus revealing the importance of
CSI. This work represents a first contribution towards the design of electron
signaling schemes in complex microbial structures, e.g., bacterial cables and
biofilms, where the tension between maximizing the transfer of information and
guaranteeing the well-being of the overall bacterial community arises.

computational burden of simulating diffusion in actual media. In principle,
isotropic CTRW only requires knowledge of the step-size, $P_l$, and
waiting-time, $P_t$, distributions of the random walk in the medium and it then
generates presumably equivalent walks in free space, which are much faster.
Here we test the usefulness of CTRW to modelling diffusion of finite-size
particles in porous medium generated by loose granular packs. This is done by
first simulating the diffusion process in a model porous medium of mean
coordination number, which corresponds to marginal rigidity (the loosest
possible structure), computing the resulting distributions $P_l$ and $P_t$ as
functions of the particle size, and then using these as input for a free space
CTRW. The CTRW walks are then compared to the ones simulated in the actual
media.
  In particular, we study the normal-to-anomalous transition of the diffusion
as a function of increasing particle size. We find that, given the same $P_l$
and $P_t$ for the simulation and the CTRW, the latter predicts incorrectly the
size at which the transition occurs. We show that the discrepancy is related to
the dependence of the effective connectivity of the porous media on the
diffusing particle size, which is not captured simply by these distributions.
  We propose a correcting modification to the CTRW model -- adding anisotropy
-- and show that it yields good agreement with the simulated diffusion process.
We also present a method to obtain $P_l$ and $P_t$ directly from the porous
sample, without having to simulate an actual diffusion process. This extends
the use of CTRW, with all its advantages, to modelling diffusion processes of
finite-size particles in such confined geometries.

algorithm can be viewed as a Frontal-Delaunay approach -- a hybridisation of
conventional Delaunay-refinement and advancing-front techniques in which new
vertices are positioned to satisfy both element size and shape constraints. The
performance of the new scheme is investigated experimentally via a series of

pressure distribution behind the wall. Due to the complex soil-structure
effect, the estimation of earth pressure is not an easy task; even in the
static case. The problem becomes even more complex for the dynamic (i.e.,
seismic) analysis and design of retaining walls. Several earth pressure models
have been developed over the years to integrate the dynamic earth pressure with
the static earth pressure and to improve the design of retaining wall in
seismic regions. Among all the models, MononobeOkabe (M-O) method is commonly
used to estimate the magnitude of seismic earth pressures in retaining walls
and is adopted in design practices around the world (e.g., EuroCode and
Australian Standards). However, the M-O method has several drawbacks and does
not provide reliable estimate of the earth pressure in many instances. This
study investigates the accuracy of the M-O method to predict the dynamic earth
pressure in sheet pile wall. A 2D plane strain finite element model of the
wall-soil system was developed in DIANA. The backfill soil was modelled with
Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion while the wall was assumed behave elastically.
The numerically predicted dynamic earth pressure was compared with the M-O
model prediction. Further, the point of application of total dynamic force was
determined and compared with the static case. Finally, the applicability of M-O
methods to compute the seismic earth pressure was discussed.

information-theoretic framework for gene regulation to spatially extended

concentration field of a transcriptional regulator (the ""input"") by expressing
a single diffusible target gene. When input concentrations are low, diffusive
coupling markedly improves information transmission; optimal gene activation
functions also systematically change. A qualitatively new regulatory strategy
emerges where individual cells respond to the input in a nearly step-like
fashion that is subsequently averaged out by strong diffusion. While motivated
by early patterning events in the Drosophila embryo, our framework is
generically applicable to spatially coupled stochastic gene expression models.

describing Hawking radiation. However, in relation to black hole (BH) emission,
this mechanism is mostly used to obtain the Hawking temperature by comparing
the probability of emission of an outgoing particle with the Boltzmann factor.
On the other hand, Banerjee and Majhi reformulated the tunnelling framework
deriving a black body spectrum through the density matrix for the outgoing
modes for both the Bose-Einstein distribution and the Fermi-Dirac distribution.
In contrast, Parikh and Wilczek introduced a correction term performing an
exact calculation of the action for a tunnelling spherically symmetric particle
and, as a result, the probability of emission of an outgoing particle
corresponds to a non-strictly thermal radiation spectrum. Recently, one of us
(C. Corda) introduced a BH effective state and was able to obtain a
non-strictly black body spectrum from the tunnelling mechanism corresponding to
the probability of emission of an outgoing particle found by Parikh and
Wilczek. The present work introduces the quantum corrected effective
temperature and the corresponding quantum corrected effective metric is written
using Hawking's periodicity arguments. Thus, we obtain further corrections to
the non-strictly thermal BH radiation spectrum as the final distributions take
into account both the BH dynamical geometry during the emission of the particle
and the quantum corrections to the semiclassical Hawking temperature.

find that the exchange energy may be negative and, thus, a singlet state may be
favorable. A full overlap in real space of wave functions of two conduction
electrons leads to a deeper exchange energy. Thus, the exchange interaction
causes a bond between two conduction electrons in real space. The singlet bond
is possible because the singlet electrons can simultaneously and permanently
occupy one spatial ground state, so the average energy of paired electrons is
lower than the energy of unpaired electrons. Thus, the pairing is a result of
the Pauli Exclusion Principle. If conduction electrons, before pairing, are put
on the Fermi surface in the momentum space, then every pair may exist
permanently in time. The motion of conduction electrons in the crystal may
prevent the formation of Cooper pairs, because the kinetic energy of the motion
is usually larger than the binding energy in the pair. Conduction electrons as
standing waves are local and have zero momenta, hence their momenta are
synchronous; therefore, weak singlet bonds are stable despite the large kinetic
energy on the Fermi surface. The local pairing of standing waves explains the
inverse isotope effect, Tc-dome, insulator-superconductor transitions and many
other facts about superconductors. The electron pairs, as bosons, can form a
macroscopically coherent Bose-Einstein-Condensate and, thus, become
non-dissipative and non-local.

$M_{Z_c}=\left(3.82^{+0.08}_{-0.08}\right)\,\rm{GeV}$, which is the lowest mass
for the hidden charmed tetraquark states from the QCD sum rules. Furthermore,
we calculate the hadronic coupling constants $G_{Z_c\eta_c\pi}$ and $G_{Z_cDD}$
with the three-point QCD sum rules, then study the strong decays $ Z_c\to
\eta_c\pi\, ,\, DD$, and observe that the total width $\Gamma_{Z_c}\approx
21\,\rm{MeV}$. The present predictions can be confronted with the experimental
data in the futures at the BESIII, LHCb and Belle-II.

migration for finding extended obstacles with phaseless total field data. We
prove that the imaging resolution of the method is essentially the same as the
imaging results using the scattering data with full phase information. The
imaginary part of the cross-correlation imaging functional always peaks on the
boundary of the obstacle. Numerical experiments are included to illustrate the
powerful imaging quality.

scale might accumulate in wavefronts propagating a cosmological distance and
lead to noticeable blurring in an image of a pointlike source. Distant quasars
viewed in the optical and ultraviolet with Hubble Space Telescope (HST} may
show this weakly, and if real suggests a stronger effect should be seen for
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in X-rays and gamma-rays. Those telescopes, however,
operate far from their diffraction limits. A description of how
Planck-scale-induced blurring could be sensed at high energy, even with cosmic
rays, while still agreeing with the HST results is discussed. It predicts
dilated apparent source size and inflated uncertainties in positional
centroids, effectively a threshold angular accuracy restricting knowledge of
source location on the sky. These outcomes are found to be consistent with an
analysis of the 10 highest-redshift GRB detections reported for the Fermi
satellite. Confusion with photon cascade and scattering phenomena is also
possible; prospects for a definitive multiwavelength measurement are
considered.

Mars by examining four different propulsion methods and keeping the mass at
departure under 2500 tonne, for a fixed architecture. We evaluated
representative systems of three different state of the art technologies
(chemical, nuclear thermal and electric) and one advance technology, the ``Pure
Electro-Magnetic Thrust'' (PEMT) concept (proposed by Rubbia). A mission
architecture mostly based on the Design Reference Architecture 5.0 is assumed
in order to estimate the mass budget, that influences the performance of the
propulsion system. Pareto curves of the duration of the mission and time of
flight versus mass of mission are drawn. We conclude that the ion engine
technology, combined with the classical chemical engine, yields the shortest
mission times for this architecture with the lowest mass and that chemical
propulsion alone is the best to minimise travel time. The results obtained
using the PEMT suggest that it could be a more suitable solution for farther
destinations than Mars.

as biology, geology and engineering. A key component of the Sanford Underground
Research Facility (SURF) is the Davis Campus, which is in operation at the
4850-foot level (4300 m.w.e.) and currently hosts two main physics projects:
the LUX dark matter experiment and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR neutrinoless
double-beta decay experiment. In addition, two low-background counters
currently operate at the Davis Campus in support of current and future
experiments. Expansion of the underground laboratory space is underway at the
4850L Ross Campus in order to maintain and enhance low-background assay
capabilities as well as to host a unique nuclear astrophysics accelerator
facility. Plans to accommodate other future experiments at SURF are also
underway and include the next generation of direct-search dark matter
experiments and the Fermilab-led international long-baseline neutrino program.
Planning to understand the infrastructure developments necessary to accommodate
these future projects is well advanced and in some cases have already started.
SURF is a dedicated research facility with significant expansion capability.
