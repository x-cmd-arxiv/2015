probe and anticipate the orientation of their neighbors. We show that a simple
anticipation strategy hinders the emergence of homogeneous flocking patterns.
Yet, anticipation promotes two other forms of self-organization: collective
spinning and swarming. In the spinning phase, all particles follow synchronous
circular orbits, while in the swarming phase, the population condensates into a
single compact swarm that cruises coherently without requiring any cohesive
interactions. We quantitatively characterize and rationalize these phases of
polar active matter and discuss potential applications to the design of
swarming robots.

due to its simplicity and well developed theoretical properties. This method is
known as a reliable method in order to apply in a broad range of applications
including high-dimensional cases. On the other hand, $L_1$ driven methods,
precisely lasso dependent regularizations, suffer the loss of sparsity when the
number of observations is too low. In this paper we address a new
differentiable approximation of lasso that can produce the same results as
lasso and ridge and also can produce smooth results. We prove the theoretical
properties of the model as well as its computation complexity. Due to
differentiability, proposed method can be implemented by means of the majority
of convex optimization methods in literature. That means a higher accuracy in
situations where true coefficients are close to zero that is a major issue of
LARS. Simulation study as well as flexibility of the method show that the
proposed approach is as reliable as lass and ridge and can be used in both

switch arbitrarily among a set of topologies. For this class of dynamic
networks, we derive an epidemic threshold, considering the SIS epidemic model.
First, an epidemic probabilistic model is developed assuming independence
between states of nodes. We identify the conditions under which the epidemic
dies out by linearizing the underlying dynamical system and analyzing its
asymptotic stability around the origin. The concept of joint spectral radius is
then used to derive the epidemic threshold, which is later validated using
several networks (Watts-Strogatz, Barabasi-Albert, MIT reality mining graphs,
Regular, and Gilbert). A simplified version of the epidemic threshold is
proposed for undirected networks. Moreover, in the case of static networks, the
derived epidemic threshold is shown to match conventional analytical results.
Then, analytical results for the epidemic threshold of dynamic networksare
proved to be applicable to periodic networks. For dynamic regular networks, we
demonstrate that the epidemic threshold is identical to the epidemic threshold
for static regular networks. An upper bound for the epidemic spread probability
in dynamic Gilbert networks is also derived and verified using simulation.

constructions in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. A polar code
construction is any algorithm that selects $K$ best among $N$ possible polar
bit-channels at the design signal-to-noise-ratio (design-SNR) in terms of bit
error rate (BER). Optimal polar code construction is hard and therefore many
suboptimal polar code constructions have been proposed at different
computational complexities. Polar codes are also non-universal meaning the code
changes significantly with the design-SNR. However, it is not known which
construction algorithm at what design-SNR constructs the best polar codes. We
first present a comprehensive survey of all the well-known polar code
constructions along with their full implementations. We then propose a
heuristic algorithm to find the best design-SNR for constructing best possible
polar codes from a given construction algorithm. The proposed algorithm
involves a search among several possible design-SNRs. We finally use our
algorithm to perform a comparison of different construction algorithms using
extensive simulations. We find that all polar code construction algorithms
generate equally good polar codes in an AWGN channel, if the design-SNR is
optimized.

by coordinated development of theory and simulation results for Ar atoms in
water. We present a concise derivation of the local molecular field (LMF)
theory for the effects of solute attractive forces on hydrophobic interactions,
a derivation that clarifies the close relation of LMF theory to the EXP
approximation applied to this problem long ago. The simulation results show
that change from purely repulsive atomic solute interactions to include
realistic attractive interactions \emph{diminishes} the strength of hydrophobic
bonds. For the Ar-Ar rdfs considered pointwise, the numerical results for the
effects of solute attractive forces on hydrophobic interactions are of opposite
sign and larger in magnitude than predicted by LMF theory. That comparison is
discussed from the point of view of quasi-chemical theory, and it is suggested
that the first reason for this difference is the incomplete evaluation within
LMF theory of the hydration energy of the Ar pair. With a recent suggestion for
the system-size extrapolation of the required correlation function integrals,
the Ar-Ar rdfs permit evaluation of osmotic second virial coefficients $B_2$.
Those $B_2$ also show that incorporation of attractive interactions leads to
more positive (repulsive) values. With attractive interactions in play, $B_2$
can change from positive to negative values with increasing temperatures. This
is consistent with the historical work of Watanabe, \emph{et al.,} that $B_2
\approx 0$ for intermediate cases. In all cases here, $B_2$ becomes more
attractive with increasing temperature.

identifiability, which extends from the previous work of Nguyen [2013] and Chen
[1995] to address a broad range of mixture models and to handle matrix-variate
parameters. These models are shown to share the same Wasserstein distance based
optimal rates of convergence for the space of mixing distributions ---
$n^{-1/2}$ under $W_1$ for the exact-fitted and $n^{-1/4}$ under $W_2$ for the
over-fitted setting, where $n$ is the sample size. This theory, however, is not
applicable to several important model classes, including location-scale
multivariate Gaussian mixtures, shape-scale Gamma mixtures and
location-scale-shape skew-normal mixtures. The second part of this work is
devoted to demonstrating that for these ""weakly identifiable"" classes,
algebraic structures of the density family play a fundamental role in
determining convergence rates of the model parameters, which display a very
rich spectrum of behaviors. For instance, the optimal rate of parameter
estimation in an over-fitted location-covariance Gaussian mixture is precisely
determined by the order of a solvable system of polynomial equations --- these
rates deteriorate rapidly as more extra components are added to the model. The
established rates for a variety of settings are illustrated by a simulation

These models are used for the simulation of fluid particles in single-phase

requirements which must be met by Lagrangian stochastic models and a new
element brought by the present analysis is to address the single- and two-phase
flow situations from a unified point of view.This analysis does not address the
question of the relative predictive capacities of different models but
concentrates on their formulation since advantages and disadvantages of
different formulations are not always clear. Indeed, hidden in the changes from
one structure to another are some possible pitfalls which can lead to flaws in
the construction of practical models and to physically-unsound numerical
calculations. A first interest of the present approach is illustrated by
considering some models proposed in the literature and by showing that these
criteria help to assess whether these Lagrangian stochastic models can be
regarded as acceptable descriptions. A second interest is to indicate how
future developments can be safely built, which is also relevant for stochastic
subgrid models for particle-laden flows in the context of Large Eddy

Let $t, k, \lambda, s$ and $v$ be nonnegative integers, and let $X$ be a set of
$v$ symbols. A generalized Howell design, denoted $t$-$GHD_{k}(s,v;\lambda)$,
is an $s\times s$ array, each cell of which is either empty or contains a
$k$-set of symbols from $X$, called a block, such that: (i) each symbol appears
exactly once in each row and in each column (i.e.\ each row and column is a
resolution of $X$); (ii) no $t$-subset of elements from $X$ appears in more
than $\lambda$ cells. Particular instances of the parameters correspond to
Howell designs, doubly resolvable balanced incomplete block designs (including
Kirkman squares), doubly resolvable nearly Kirkman triple systems, and simple
orthogonal multi-arrays (which themselves generalize mutually orthogonal Latin
squares). Generalized Howell designs also have connections with permutation
arrays and multiply constant-weight codes.
  In this paper, we concentrate on the case that $t=2$, $k=3$ and $\lambda=1$,
and write $GHD(s,v)$. In this case, the number of empty cells in each row and
column falls between 0 and $(s-1)/3$. Previous work has considered the
existence of GHDs on either end of the spectrum, with at most 1 or at least
$(s-2)/3$ empty cells in each row or column. In the case of one empty cell, we
correct some results of Wang and Du, and show that there exists a $GHD(n+1,3n)$
if and only if $n \geq 6$, except possibly for $n=6$. In the case of two empty
cells, we show that there exists a $GHD(n+2,3n)$ if and only if $n \geq 6$.
Noting that the proportion of cells in a given row or column of a $GHD(s,v)$
which are empty falls in the interval $[0,1/3)$, we prove that for any $\pi \in
[0,5/18]$, there is a $GHD(s,v)$ whose proportion of empty cells in a row or
column is arbitrarily close to $\pi$.

2-bridge knot. Pretzel knots with bridge number $\geq 3$ are not
$SU(2)$-simple. We provide an infinite family of knots $K$ with bridge number
$\geq 3$ which are $SU(2)$-simple.
  One expects the instanton knot Floer homology $I^\natural(K)$ of a
$SU(2)$-simple knot to be as small as it can be -- of rank equal to the knot
determinant $\det(K)$. In fact, the complex underlying $I^\natural(K)$ is of
rank equal to $\det(K)$, provided a genericity assumption holds that is
reasonable to expect. Thus formally there is a resemblance to strong L-spaces
in Heegaard Floer homology. For the class of $SU(2)$-simple knots that we
introduce this formal resemblance is reflected topologically: The branched
double covers of these knots are strong L-spaces. In fact, somewhat
surprisingly, these knots are alternating. However, the Conway spheres are
hidden in any alternating diagram.

superconductivity for systems with competing order parameters. We assume that
parameters characterizing the material allow formation of another order like
charge- or spin-density wave competing and prevailing superconductivity in the
bulk (hidden superconductivity). Diffusive electron scattering on the interface
results in a suppression of this order and releasing the superconductivity. Our
theory is based on the use of Ginzburg--Landau equations applicable to a broad
class of systems. We demonstrate that the local superconductivity appears in
the vicinity of the interface and the spatial dependence of the superconducting
order parameter~$\Delta(x)$ is described by the Gross--Pitaevskii equation.
Solving this equation we obtain quantized values of temperature and doping
levels at which~$\Delta(x)$ appears. Remarkably, the local superconductivity
shows up even in the case when the rival order is only slightly suppressed and
may arise also on the surface of the sample (surface superconductivity).

Part of this outflow region is photoionised by the AGN, and shares properties
with the ENLR of Seyfert galaxies, but the inner ($R \lesssim 1.0$~arcsec)
accretion disk and the region around the radio jet appear shock excited. The
emission line properties can be modelled by a ""double shock"" model in which the
accretion flow first passes through an accretion shock in the presence of a
hard X-ray radiation, and the accretion disk is then processed through a cocoon
shock driven by the overpressure of the radio jets. This model explains the
observation of two distinct densities ($\sim10^4$ and $\sim10^6$ cm$^{-3}$),
and provides a good fit to the observed emission line spectrum. We derive
estimates for the velocities of the two shock components and their mixing
fractions, the black hole mass, the accretion rate needed to sustain the LINER
emission and derive an estimate for the jet power. Our emission line model is
remarkably robust against variation of input parameters, and so offers a

identified through detection of sub-stellar companions by periodic radial

far-infrared wavelengths, respectively. Since the material that goes into
producing the observable outcomes of planet formation is the same, we might
expect these components to be related both to each other and their host star.
Heretofore, our knowledge of planetary systems around other stars has been
strongly limited by instrumental sensitivity. In this work, we combine
observations at far-infrared wavelengths by IRAS, Spitzer, and Herschel with
limits on planetary companions derived from non-detections in the 16-year

because inflexibility in the choice of sampling directions can leave the
sampler trapped at a vertex of the convex polytope that describes the feasible
set of route flows. We prove that so long as the network's link-path incidence

system representation of the polytope for which sampling parallel to the axes
is adequate. This motivates a modified sampler in which the representation of
the polytope adapts to provide good mixing behavior. This methodology is
applied to three road traffic data sets. We conclude with a discussion of the

data rates, by using directional communications with narrow beams. However,
existing mmW communications standards are hindered by two problems: deafness
and single link scheduling. The deafness problem, that is, a misalignment
between transmitter and receiver beams, demands a time consuming beam-searching
operation, which leads to an alignment-throughput tradeoff. Moreover, the
existing mmW standards schedule a single link in each time slot and hence do
not fully exploit the potential of mmW communications, where directional
communications allow multiple concurrent transmissions. These two problems are
addressed in this paper, where a joint beamwidth selection and power allocation
problem is formulated by an optimization problem for short range mmW networks
with the objective of maximizing effective network throughput. This
optimization problem allows establishing the fundamental alignment-throughput
tradeoff, however it is computationally complex and requires exact knowledge of
network topology, which may not be available in practice. Therefore, two
standard-compliant approximation solution algorithms are developed, which rely
on underestimation and overestimation of interference. The first one exploits
directionality to maximize the reuse of available spectrum and thereby
increases the network throughput, while imposing almost no computational
complexity. The second one is a more conservative approach that protects all
active links from harmful interference, yet enhances the network throughput by
100% compared to the existing standards. Extensive performance analysis
provides useful insights on the directionality level and the number of
concurrent transmissions that should be pursued. Interestingly, extremely
narrow beams are in general not optimal.

positivity of canonical energy on an appropriate space of perturbations is
necessary and sufficient for stability. However, the notions of both
""stability"" and ""instability"" in this result are significantly weaker than one
would like to obtain. In this paper, we prove that if a perturbation of the
form $\pounds_t \delta g$---with $\delta g$ a solution to the linearized
Einstein equation---has negative canonical energy, then that perturbation must,
in fact, grow exponentially in time. The key idea is to make use of the $t$- or
($t$-$\phi$)-reflection isometry, $i$, of the background spacetime and
decompose the initial data for perturbations into their odd and even parts
under $i$. We then write the canonical energy as $\mathscr E\ = \mathscr K +
\mathscr U$, where $\mathscr K$ and $\mathscr U$, respectively, denote the
canonical energy of the odd part (kinetic energy) and even part (potential
energy). One of the main results of this paper is the proof that $\mathscr K$
is positive definite for any black hole background. We use $\mathscr K$ to
construct a Hilbert space $\mathscr H$ on which time evolution is given in
terms of a self-adjoint operator $\tilde {\mathcal A}$, whose spectrum includes
negative values if and only if $\mathscr U$ fails to be positive. Negative
spectrum of $\tilde{\mathcal A}$ implies exponential growth of the
perturbations in $\mathscr H$ that have nontrivial projection into the negative
spectral subspace. This includes all perturbations of the form $\pounds_t

principle is derived, which can be used to obtain lower bounds on the rate of
exponential growth.

generates the optimal Universal Logic Block (ULB) that can perform any logical
fault-tolerant (FT) quantum operations with the minimum latency. The operation
scheduling, placement, and qubit routing problems tackled by the quantum
physical mapper are highly dependent on one another. More precisely, the
scheduling solution affects the quality of the achievable placement solution
due to resource pressures that may be created as a result of operation
scheduling whereas the operation placement and qubit routing solutions
influence the scheduling solution due to resulting distances between
predecessor and current operations, which in turn determines routing latencies.
The proposed flow for the quantum physical mapper captures these dependencies
by applying (i) a loose scheduling step, which transforms an initial quantum
data flow graph into one that explicitly captures the no-cloning theorem of the
quantum computing and then performs instruction scheduling based on a modified
force-directed scheduling approach to minimize the resource contention and
quantum circuit latency, (ii) a placement step, which uses timing-driven
instruction placement to minimize the approximate routing latencies while
making iterative calls to the aforesaid force-directed scheduler to correct
scheduling levels of quantum operations as needed, and (iii) a routing step
that finds dynamic values of routing latencies for the qubits. In addition to
the quantum physical mapper, an approach is presented to determine the single
best ULB size for a target quantum circuit by examining the latency of
different FT quantum operations mapped onto different ULB sizes and using
information about the occurrence frequency of operations on critical paths of
the target quantum algorithm to weigh these latencies.

extracellular fluids leads to loss of bone density and neuronal
hyper-excitability. To counteract this problem, calcium ions are present at
high concentrations throughout body fluids -- at concentrations exceeding the
saturation point. This condition leads to the opposite situation where unwanted
mineral sedimentation may occur. Remarkably, ectopic or out-of-place
sedimentation into soft tissues is rare, in spite of the thermodynamic driving
factors. This fortunate fact is due to the presence of auto-regulatory proteins
that are found in abundance in bodily fluids. Yet, many important inflammatory
disorders such as atherosclerosis and osteoarthritis are associated with this
undesired calcification. Hence, it is important to gain an understanding of the
regulatory process and the conditions under which it can go awry. In this
manuscript, we adapt mean-field classical nucleation theory to the case of
surface-shielding in order to study the regulation of sedimentation of calcium
phosphate salts in biological tissues through the mechanism of post-nuclear
shielding of nascent mineral particles by binding proteins. We develop a
mathematical description of this phenomenon using a countable system of

time-reversal-invariant Majorana nanowires. We investigate the Josephson effect
in the Majorana-doublet-presented junction modified by different inter-doublet
coupling manners. It is found that when the Majorana doublets couple indirectly
via a non-magnetic quantum dot, only the normal Josephson effects occur, and
the fermion parity in the system just affects the current direction and
amplitude. However, in the odd-parity case, applying finite magnetic field on
the quantum dot can induce the appearance of the fractional Josephson effect.
Next, when the direct and indirect couplings between the Majorana doublets
coexist, no fractional Josephson effect takes place, regardless of finite
magnetic field on the quantum dot. Instead, the $\pi$-period current has an
opportunity to appear in some special cases. All the results are clarified by
analyzing the influence of the fermion occupation in the quantum dot on the
parity conservation in the whole system. We ascertain that this work will be
helpful for describing the dot-assisted Josephson effect between the Majorana
doublets.

based on a continuum-discretization procedure is described in detail. The
complete discretization of continuous spectrum is realized using stationary
wave packets which are the normalized states constructed from exact
non-normalized continuum states. Projecting the wave functions and all
scattering operators like $t$-matrix, resolvent, etc. on such a wave-packet
basis results in a formulation of quantum scattering problem entirely in terms
of discrete elements and linear equations with regular matrices. It is
demonstrated that there is a close relation between the above stationary wave
packets and pseudostates which are employed often to approximate the scattering
states with a finite $L_2$ basis. Such a fully discrete treatment of
complicated few- and many-body scattering problems leads to significant
simplification of their practical solution. Also we get finite-dimensional
approximations for complicated operators like effective interactions between
composite particles constructed via the Feshbach-type projection formalism. As
illustrations to this general approach we consider several important particular
problems including multichannel scattering and scattering in the three-nucleon

universe starts expanding from Minkowski in the asymptotic past by violating
the null energy condition stably. Several concrete models of galilean genesis
have been constructed so far within the context of galileon-type scalar-field
theories. We give a generic, unified description of the galilean genesis
scenario in terms of the Horndeski theory, i.e., the most general scalar-tensor
theory with second-order field equations. In doing so we generalize the
previous models to have a new parameter (denoted by {\alpha}) which results in
controlling the evolution of the Hubble rate. The background dynamics is
investigated to show that the generalized galilean genesis solution is an
attractor, similarly to the original model. We also study the nature of
primordial perturbations in the generalized galilean genesis scenario. In all
the models described by our generalized genesis Lagrangian, amplification of
tensor perturbations does not occur as opposed to what happens in quasi-de
Sitter inflation. We show that the spectral index of curvature perturbations is
determined solely from the parameter {\alpha} and does not depend on the other
details of the model. In contrast to the original model, a nearly
scale-invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations is obtained for a specific
choice of {\alpha}.

small scales, in an incompressible isotropic turbulent flow, have a statistical
conservation law. More specifically, in a d-dimensional flow the distance
$R(t)$ between two neutrally buoyant particles, raised to the power $-d$ and
averaged over velocity realizations, remains at all times equal to the initial,
fixed, separation raised to the same power. In this work we present evidence
from direct numerical simulations of two and three dimensional turbulence for
this conservation. In both cases the conservation is lost when particles exit
the linear flow regime. In 2D we show that, as an extension of the conservation
law, a Evans-Cohen-Morriss/Gallavotti-Cohen type fluctuation relation exists.
We also analyse data from a 3D laboratory experiment [Liberzon et al., Physica
D 241, 208 (2012)], finding that although it probes small scales they are not
in the smooth regime. Thus instead of $\left<R^{-3}\right>$, we look for a
similar, power-law-in-separation conservation law. We show that the existence
of an initially slowly varying function of this form can be predicted but that
it does not turn into a conservation law. We suggest that the conservation of
$\left<R^{-d}\right>$, demonstrated here, can be used as a check of isotropy,
incompressibility and flow dimensionality in numerical and laboratory
experiments that focus on small scales.

shield"" that is attached to the design to enforce the properties at run time.
Shield synthesis can succeed where model checking and reactive synthesis fail,
because it only considers a small set of critical properties, as opposed to the
complex design, or the complete specification in the case of reactive
synthesis. The shield continuously monitors the input/output of the design and
corrects its erroneous output only if necessary, and as little as possible, so
other non-critical properties are likely to be retained. Although runtime
enforcement has been studied in other domains such as action systems, reactive
systems pose unique challenges where the shield must act without delay. We thus
present the first shield synthesis solution for reactive hardware systems and
report our experimental results. This is an extended version of [5], featuring
an additional appendix.

signals under additive sparse and dense noise. Typically, sparse noise models
outliers, impulse bursts or data loss. To handle sparse noise, existing methods
simultaneously estimate the sparse signal of interest and the sparse noise of
no interest. For estimating the sparse signal, without the need of estimating
the sparse noise, we construct a robust Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). In the
RVM, sparse noise and ever present dense noise are treated through a combined
noise model. The precision of combined noise is modeled by a diagonal matrix.
We show that the new RVM update equations correspond to a non-symmetric
sparsity inducing cost function. Further, the combined modeling is found to be
computationally more efficient. We also extend the method to block-sparse
signals and noise with known and unknown block structures. Through simulations,
we show the performance and computation efficiency of the new RVM in several
applications: recovery of sparse and block sparse signals, housing price
prediction and image denoising.

choosing the most efficient survey strategy. For the non-parallel modes we
study the dependence on the telescope offset angle. We show that use of both

comparison with use of the parallel mode. The fastest source detection can be
achieved in the divergent mode with larger offset angles ($\sim 6^{\circ}$ from
the Field of View centre for the outermost telescopes), for which the time
needed to perform a scan at a given sensitivity level is shorter by a factor of
$\sim$2.3 than for the parallel mode. We note, however, the direction and
energy reconstruction accuracy for the divergent mode is even by a factor of
$\sim 2$ worse than for other modes. Furthermore, we find that at high energies

the best performance parameters are achieved with the convergent mode, which
favors this mode for deep observations of sources with hard energy spectra.

the coalescence of two neutron stars (NS-NS). One possible outcome of such a
merger would be a rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron star (known as
a millisecond magnetar). These magnetars may be ""supra-massive"", implying they
would collapse to black holes after losing centrifugal support due to magnetic
dipole spindown. By systematically analyzing the BAT-XRT light curves of all
short GRBs detected by {\em swift}, we test how well the data are consistent
with this central engine model of short GRBs. We find that the so-called
""extended emission"" observed with BAT in some short GRBs are fundamentally the
same component as the ""internal X-ray plateau"" as observed in many short GRBs,
which is defined as a plateau in the lightcurve followed by a very rapid drop.
Based on how likely a short GRB hosts a magnetar, we characterize the entire
{\em Swift} short GRB sample into three categories: the ""internal plateau""
sample, the ""external plateau"" sample, and the ""no plateau"" sample. The derived
magnetar surface magnetic field $B_{\rm p}$ and the initial spin period $P_0$
fall into the reasonable range. No GRBs in the internal plateau sample have the
total energy exceeding the maximum energy budget of a millisecond magnetar.
Assuming that the rapid fall time at the end of the internal plateau is the
collapse time of a supra-massive magnetar to a black hole, and applying the
measured mass distribution of NS-NS systems in our Galaxy, we constrain the
neutron star equation of state (EOS). The data suggest that the NS equation of
state is close to the GM1 model, which has a maximum non-rotating NS mass
$M_{\rm TOV} \sim 2.37 M_\odot$.

particles with flat facets, i.e., particles with polygonal shapes, is
significantly more limited. This can be attributed to the fact that, contrary
to nanoparticles, the larger colloids are significantly harder to synthesize as
single crystals. Herein, we demonstrate that the simplest building block, such
as the micron-sized polymeric spherical colloidal particle, is already enough
to fabricate particles with regularly placed flat facets, including completely
polygonal shapes with sharp edges. As an illustration that the yields are high

previous methods: we transform order into disorder while preserving bandgaps.
Our approach enables the formation of bandgaps in extremely-disordered
potentials analogous to Brownian motion, and also allows the tuning of
correlations while maintaining identical bandgaps, thereby creating a family of

spatial lattice. Our definition applies to any subset of links in the lattice,
and is valid for both Abelian and Non-Abelian gauge theories. For
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ and $U(1)$ theories, without matter, our definition agrees with
a particular case of the definition given by Casini, Huerta and Rosabal. We
also argue that in general, both for Abelian and Non-Abelian theories, our
definition agrees with the entanglement entropy calculated using a definition
of the replica trick. Our definition, however, does not agree with some
standard ways to measure entanglement, like the number of Bell pairs which can
be produced by entanglement distillation.

by large-sized multimedia contents. Recent advancements in smart devices as
well as radio access technologies promote the consumption of bulky content,
even for people in moving vehicles, referred to as vehicular heavy users. In
this article the emergence of vehicular heavy user traffic is observed by field
experiments conducted in 2012 and 2015 in Seoul, Korea. The experiments reveal
that such traffic is becoming dominant, captured by the 8.62 times increase in
vehicular heavy user traffic while the total traffic increased 3.04 times. To
resolve this so-called vehicular heavy user problem (VHP), we propose a cell
association algorithm that exploits user demand diversity for different
velocities. This user traffic pattern is discovered first by our field trials,
which is convex-shaped over velocity, i.e. walking user traffic is less than
stationary or vehicular user traffic. As the VHP becomes severe, numerical
evaluation verifies the proposed user convexity aware association outperforms a
well-known load balancing association in practice, cell range expansion (CRE).
In addition to the cell association, several complementary techniques are
suggested in line with the technical trend toward 5G.

In this Letter, given a number of non-thermal quantum channels, we study the
problem of how to integrate them in a thermal engine so as to distill a maximum
amount of work. We find that, in the limit of asymptotically many uses of each
channel, the distillable work is an additive function of the considered
channels, computable for both finite dimensional quantum operations and bosonic
channels. We apply our results to bound the amount of distillable work due to
the natural non-thermal processes postulated in the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW)
collapse model. We find that, although GRW theory predicts the possibility to
extract work from the vacuum at no cost, the power which a \emph{collapse
engine} could in principle generate is extremely low.

time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB) is used for solving the

many-body entropy measures such as the Shannon information entropy, number of
principal components, and occupation entropy that are computed from the
time-dependent many-body basis set used in MCTDHB. These measures quantify
relevant physical features such as irregular or chaotic dynamics, statistical
relaxation and thermalization. We monitor the entropy measures as a function of
time and assess how they depend on the interaction strength. For larger
interaction strength, the many-body information entropy approaches the value
predicted for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices and implies
statistical relaxation. The basis states of MCTDHB are explicitly
time-dependent and optimized by the variational principle in a way that
minimizes the number of significantly contributing ones. It is therefore a
non-trivial fact that statistical relaxation prevails in MCTDHB computations.
Moreover, we demonstrate a fundamental connection between the production of
entropy, the build-up of correlations and loss of coherence in the system.
Since the coherence and correlations are experimentally accessible, their
present connection to many-body entropies can be scrutinized to detect
statistical relaxation. Our results are the first ones obtained for
thermalization of finite quantum systems using an optimized time-dependent and

space have shown that nanometer-scale dust, or nanodust, is a significant
contributor to the total mass in interplanetary space. Better measurements of
nanodust will allow us to determine where it comes from and the extent to which
it interacts with the solar wind. When one of these nanodust grains impacts a
spacecraft, it creates an expanding plasma cloud, which perturbs the
photoelectron currents. This leads to a voltage pulse between the spacecraft
body and the antenna. Nanodust has a high charge/mass ratio, and therefore can
be accelerated by the interplanetary magnetic field to speeds up to the speed
of the solar wind: significantly faster than the Keplerian orbital speeds of
heavier dust. The amplitude of the signal induced by a dust grain grows much
more strongly with speed than with mass of the dust particle. As a result,
nanodust can produce a strong signal, despite their low mass. The WAVES
instruments on the twin Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft have
observed interplanetary nanodust particles since shortly after their launch in

  Security and Trust (POST) 2015",,,,"cs.CR cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Security policies are naturally dynamic. Reflecting this, there has been a
growing interest in studying information-flow properties which change during
program execution, including concepts such as declassification, revocation, and
role-change.
  A static verification of a dynamic information flow policy, from a semantic
perspective, should only need to concern itself with two things: 1) the
dependencies between data in a program, and 2) whether those dependencies are
consistent with the intended flow policies as they change over time. In this
paper we provide a formal ground for this intuition. We present a
straightforward extension to the principal flow-sensitive type system
introduced by Hunt and Sands (POPL '06, ESOP '11) to infer both end-to-end
dependencies and dependencies at intermediate points in a program. This allows
typings to be applied to verification of both static and dynamic policies. Our
extension preserves the principal type system's distinguishing feature, that
type inference is independent of the policy to be enforced: a single, generic
dependency analysis (typing) can be used to verify many different dynamic
policies of a given program, thus achieving a clean separation between (1) and
(2).
  We also make contributions to the foundations of dynamic information flow.
Arguably, the most compelling semantic definitions for dynamic security
conditions in the literature are phrased in the so-called knowledge-based
style. We contribute a new definition of knowledge-based termination
insensitive security for dynamic policies. We show that the new definition
avoids anomalies of previous definitions and enjoys a simple and useful
characterisation as a two-run style property.

Unruh effect by using two main tools: the Unruh-DeWitt detectors and the
effective temperature function (ETF), this last tool based on Bogoliubov
transformations. Using the Unruh-DeWitt detectors we find an adiabatic
expansion of the detection properties along linear trajectories with slowly
varying acceleration in Minkowski, which allows us to calculate the spectrum
detected, finding the thermal spectrum as the zeroth order contribution. Using
the ETF we study the perception of Hawking radiation by observers following
radial trajectories outside a Schwarzschild black hole. One of the most
important results is that, in general, free-falling observers crossing the
event horizon do detect some radiation, even when the field is in the Unruh
vacuum state, due to a Doppler blue-shift that diverges at the horizon. We give
a general expression for the ETF, which has a clear interpretation in terms of
well-known physical phenomena. We discuss which contribution to the perception
comes from the radiation emitted by the black hole, and which contribution is
due to the Unruh effect caused by the movement of the observer. We conclude
that the Unruh effect is not only due to the observer's proper acceleration and
cannot even be defined locally, but is due to the observer's acceleration with
respect to the asymptotic region. We apply the ETF to the analysis of different
physical situations, in particular to a possible buoyancy scenario near the
horizon due to Hawking radiation pressure. Finally, we propose a non-stationary
vacuum state, which we call pulsating vacuum, for the radiation field outside a
stellar object hovering closely to form an event horizon. In this vacuum state,
we get nearly Hawking radiation emitted by the object, while avoiding the known
problems of the information paradox and the trans-planckian problem.

services. This way knowledge exchange becomes more urgent. The first workshop
set the research agenda, by introducing in each other methods, reporting about
current research problems and brainstorming about common interests. This

problem into the focus. In particular, we will explore how statistical

anisotropies at large angular scales (low-$\ell$), as has been confirmed by the
recent Planck data also (up to $\ell=40$), although statistically not very
strong (less than $3\sigma$), is still an open problem. One can avoid to seek
an explanation for this problem by attributing the lack of power to cosmic
variance orcan look for explanations i.e., different inflationary potentials or
initial conditions for infl ation to begin with, non-trivial topology, ISW
effect etc. Features in the primordial power spectrum (PPS) motivated by the
early universe physics has been the most common solution to address this
problem. In the present work we also follow this approach and consider a set of
PPS which have features and constrain the parameters of those using WMAP 9 year
and Planck data employing Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The
prominent feature of all the models of PPS that we consider is an infra-red cut
off which leads to suppression of power at large angular scales. We consider
models of PPS with maximum three extra parameters and use Akaike information
criterion ($AIC$) and Bayesian information criterion ($BIC$) of model and
Bayesian information criterion ($BIC$) of model selection to compare the
models. For most models, we find good constraints for the cut off scale $k_c$,
however, for other parameters our constraints are not that good. We find that
sharp cut off model gives best likelihood value for the WMAP 9 year data, but
is as good as power law model according to $AIC$. For the joint WMAP 9+Planck
data set, Starobinsky model is slightly preferred by $AIC$ which is also able
to produce CMB power suppression up to $\ell\leq30$ to some extent.

were previously characterized with long-cadence (LC) Kepler data. Here we aim
at refining the parameters of these transiting systems by i) modelling the
published radial velocities (RV) and Kepler short-cadence (SC) data that
provide a much better sampling of the transits, ii) performing new spectral
analyses of the SOPHIE and ESPaDOnS spectra, and iii) improving stellar
rotation periods hence stellar age estimates through gyrochronology, when
possible. Posterior distributions of the system parameters were derived with a
differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. Our main results are
as follows: a) Kepler-41b is significantly larger and less dense than
previously found because a lower orbital inclination is favoured by SC data.
This also affects the determination of the geometric albedo that is lower than
previously derived: Ag < 0.135; b) Kepler-44b is moderately smaller and denser
than reported in the discovery paper; c) good agreement was achieved with
published Kepler-43, Kepler-75, and KOI-205 system parameters, although the
host stars Kepler-75 and KOI-205 were found to be slightly richer in metals and
hotter, respectively; d) the previously reported non-zero eccentricities of
Kepler-39b and Kepler-74b might be spurious. If their orbits were circular, the
two companions would be smaller and denser than in the eccentric case. The
radius of Kepler-39b is still larger than predicted by theoretical isochrones.
Its parent star is hotter and richer in metals than previously determined.

texture retrieval. It focuses on feature extraction and similarity measure for

Scattering transform, for the process of feature extraction in texture
retrieval. It shares a distinctive property of providing a robust
representation, which is stable with respect to spatial deformations. Recent
work has demonstrated its capability for texture classification, and hence as a
promising candidate for the problem of texture retrieval.
  Moreover, we adopt a common approach of measuring the similarity of textures
by comparing the subband histograms of a filterbank transform. To this end we
derive a similarity measure based on the popular Bhattacharyya Kernel. Despite
the popularity of describing histograms using parametrized probability density
functions, such as the Generalized Gaussian Distribution, it is unfortunately
not applicable for describing most of the Scattering transform subbands, due to
the complex modulus performed on each one of them. In this work, we propose to
use the Weibull distribution to model the Scattering subbands of descendant
layers.

taking the robust counterpart of a linear inequality that is affine in the

  In the literature, often the reformulation is used that is exact when there
is no uncertainty. However, in robust optimization this reformulation gives an
inferior solution and provides a pessimistic view. We observe that in many
papers this conservatism is not mentioned. Some papers have recognized this
problem, but existing solutions are either conservative or their performance
for different uncertainty regions is not known, a comparison between them is
not available, and they are restricted to specific problems. We describe
techniques for general problems and compare them with numerical examples in
inventory management, regression and brachytherapy. Based on these examples, we
give recommendations for reducing the conservatism.

simultaneously explain the Fermi-LAT results indicating a $\gamma$-ray excess
observed from our Galactic Centre in the 1-3 GeV energy range and the detection
of an X-ray line at 3.55 keV from extragalactic sources. Two additional
Standard Model singlet scalar fields $S_2$ and $S_3$ are introduced. These
fields couple among themselves and with the Standard Model Higgs doublet $H$.
The interaction terms among the scalar fields, namely $H$, $S_2$ and $S_3$, are
constrained by the application of a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2\times
\mathbb{Z}^\prime_2$ symmetry which breaks softly to a remnant
$\mathbb{Z}^{\prime \prime}_2$ symmetry. This residual discrete symmetry is
then spontaneously broken through an MeV order vacuum expectation value $u$ of
the singlet scalar field $S_3$. The resultant physical scalar spectrum has the
Standard Model like Higgs as $\chi_{{}_{{}_1}}$ with $M_{\chi_{{}_{{}_1}}}\sim
125$ GeV, a moderately heavy scalar $\chi_{{}_{{}_2}}$ with $50 \,\,{\rm GeV}
\leq M_{\chi_{{}_{{}_2}}}\leq 80\,\,{\rm GeV}$ and a light $\chi_{{}_{{}_3}}$
with $M_{\chi_{{}_{{}_3}}} \sim 7$ keV. There is only tiny mixing between
$\chi_{{}_{{}_1}}$ and $\chi_{{}_{{}_2}}$ as well as between $\chi_{{}_{{}_1}}$
and $\chi_{{}_{{}_3}}$. The lack of importance of domain wall formation in the
present scenario from the spontaneous breaking of the discrete symmetry
${\mathbb{Z}_2^{\prime\prime}}$, provided $u\leq 10$ MeV, is pointed out. We
find that our proposed two component dark matter model is able to explain
successfully both the above mentioned phenomena $-$ the Fermi-LAT observed
$\gamma$-ray excess (from the $\chi_{{}_{{}_2}} \rightarrow {\rm b} \bar{\rm
b}$ decay mode) and the observation of the X-ray line (from the decay channel
$\chi_{{}_{{}_3}}\rightarrow\gamma \gamma$) by the XMM-Newton observatory.

model. We derive four stability constraints, of which only three independent
from each other. After scanning the model's parameter space for
phenomenologically viable data points, we impose the stability constraints and
find that only about a quarter of the data points features a stable EW minimum.
At those data points featuring stability, $\mu$ and the up Higgs soft mass turn
out to be smaller than about a TeV in absolute value, which make the mass of
the lightest chargino and neutralino smaller than about 700 GeV. Two relevant
phenomenological consequences of lifting the unbounded from below directions
are that the lightest Higgs boson decay rate to diphoton predicted by the
triplet extension of MSSM generally features larger deviations from MSSM and
fine tuning is actually higher, that what each of the two would be without
imposing stability constraints.

within +/-0.14 dex/R25 (R25 is the B-band iso-photoal radius), but the
metallicity gradients can differ significantly when the ionisation parameters
change systematically with radius. We investigate the metallicity gradients as
a function of stellar mass (8<log(M*/Msun)<11) and absolute B-band luminosity
(-16 > MB > -22). When the metallicity gradients are expressed in dex/kpc, we
show that galaxies with lower mass and luminosity, on average, have steeper
metallicity gradients. When the metallicity gradients are expressed in dex/R25,
we find no correlation between the metallicity gradients, and stellar mass and

star-forming galaxies useful for comparison with studies at high redshifts. We
investigate the origin of the local benchmark gradient using simple chemical
evolution models and observed gas and stellar surface density profiles in
nearby field spiral galaxies. Our models suggest that the local benchmark
gradient is a direct result of the coevolution of gas and stellar disk under
virtually closed-box chemical evolution when the stellar-to-gas mass ratio
becomes high (>>0.3). These models imply low current mass accretion rates

initial wave packets escape from the potential and the dynamics is like that of

reinterpreted as a theory where only the instantaneous shapes of configurations

minimum goal for the signal-to-noise ratio, which implies a minimum exposure

not impossible, because the apparent separation becomes decoupled from the
inclination angle of the orbit. The combination of this nodal effect with
considerations of solar and anti-solar pointing restrictions, photometric and

limits the observing opportunities, often to only brief intervals in a
five-year mission. We compare the science power of four missions, two with
external star shades, EXO-S and WFIRST-S, and two with internal coronagraphs,
EXO-C and WFIRST-C. The star shades out-perform the coronagraph in this science

elements of my IFT Madrid Anthropics Conference talk. The original was too
technical. The current version uses intuitive notions from black hole physics
to explain the model of inflationary cosmology based on the Holographic Space
Time formalism. The reason that the initial state of the universe had low
entropy is that more generic states have no localized excitations, since in
HST, localized excitations are defined by constraints on the fundamental
variables. The only way to obtain a radiation dominated era, is for each
time-like geodesic to see an almost uniform gas of small black holes as its
horizon expands, such that the holes evaporate into radiation before they
collide and coalesce. Comparing the time slicing that follows causal diamonds
along a trajectory, with the global FRW slicing, one sees that systems outside
the horizon had to undergo inflation, with a number of e-folds fixed by the
present and inflationary cosmological constants, and the black hole number
density on FRW slices just after inflation ends. These parameters also
determine the size of scalar and tensor metric perturbations and the reheat
temperature of the universe. I sketch a class of explicit finite quantum
mechanical models of cosmology, which have these properties. Physicists
interested in the details of those models should consult a recent

under Total Store Order (TSO). The problem has been shown to be decidable but
the cost is prohibitive, namely non-primitive recursive. We propose here to
give up completeness. Our contribution is a new algorithm for TSO reachability:
it uses the standard SC semantics and introduces the TSO semantics lazily and
only where needed. At the heart of our algorithm is an iterative refinement of
the program of interest. If the program's goal state is SC-reachable, we are
done. If the goal state is not SC-reachable, this may be due to the fact that
SC under-approximates TSO. We employ a second algorithm that determines TSO
computations which are infeasible under SC, and hence likely to lead to new
states. We enrich the program to emulate, under SC, these TSO computations.
Altogether, this yields an iterative under-approximation that we prove sound
and complete for bug hunting, i.e., a semi-decision procedure halting for
positive cases of reachability. We have implemented the procedure as an
extension to the tool Trencher and compared it to the Memorax and CBMC model

The ion behavior of a drift tube directly influences the detection of ion
intensity, and then influences the detection sensitivity of a system.
Interelectrode voltage and pressure directly influence the ion behavior. Gas
discharge between electrodes influences the adjustments required for
interelectrode voltage. The experimental results show: ion intensity increases
exponentially with the increment of voltage between drift electrodes; ion
intensity decreases exponentially as pressure increases; with the increment of
pressure, the breakdown voltage at first decreases, and then increases; ion
injection has a significant influence on breakdown voltage, and this influence
depends on the pressure and shapes of the electrodes. We explain the results
above through assumptions and by mathematical methods.

plateau in any moment of any day, respectively. In this way we obtain a series
of the figures which unambiguously imply the following original results. Any of
three remarkable Giza pyramids (Cheops, Chephren and Mikerin) holds only one
characteristic edge between apex and north-west vertex of the base so that
sunrise direction overlap almost exactly this edge during 28. October. (There
is a small declination of the overlap date by Chephren pyramid by which overlap
date is approximately 23. or 24. October.) Simultaneously, in the sunset moment

Egypt mythology) appears at a point at the very eastern boundary of the sky

problems of Newell-Whitehead- Segel are solved by the HPM and the exact
solutions are obtained. The trend of the rapid convergence of the sequences
constructed by the method toward the exact solution is shown numerically. As a
result the rapid convergence towards the exact solutions of HPM indicates that,
using the HPM to solve the Newell-Whitehead-Segel non-linear differential
equations, a reasonable less amount of computational work with acceptable
accuracy may be sufficient. Moreover the application of the HPM proves that the
method is an effective and simple tool for solving the Newell-Whitehead-Segel
non-linear differential equations.

  by Improved Variational Linear Regression",,,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian approaches to variable selection have been widely used for
quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms for that aim are often difficult to be implemented for
high-dimensional variable selection problems, such as the ones arising in
epistatic analysis. Variational approximation is an alternative to MCMC, and
variational linear regression (VLR) is an effective solution for the variable
selection problems, but lacks accuracy in some QTL mapping problems where there
are many more variables than samples. In this paper, we propose an effective
method with aim to improve the accuracy of VLR in the case of above by
dynamically reducing components (variable or markers) with known effects (zero
or fixed). We show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of
VLR with little increase in computational cost. The method is compared with
several other variational methods used for QTL mapping, and simulation results
show that its performance is higher than those methods when applied in
high-dimensional cases.
