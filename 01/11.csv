  Factorize RSA Public Key Encryption",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The security of RSA algorithm depends upon the positive integer N, which is
the multiple of two precise large prime numbers. Factorization of such great
numbers is a problematic process. There are many algorithms has been
implemented in the past years. The offered KNJ -Factorization algorithm
contributes a deterministic way to factorize RSA. The algorithm limits the
search by only considering the prime values. Subsequently prime numbers are odd
numbers accordingly it also requires smaller number steps to factorize RSA. In
this paper, the anticipated algorithm is very simple besides it is very easy to
understand and implement. The main concept of this KNJ factorization algorithm
is, to check only those factors which are odd and prime. The proposed KNJ-
Factorization algorithm works very efficiently on those factors; which are
adjoining and close to N. The proposed factorization method can speed up if we
can reduce the time for primality testing. It fundamentally decreases the time
complexity.

  Social Science"")",,,,"q-bio.NC stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a general theory of series-parallel mental architectures with
selectively influenced stochastically non-independent components. A mental
architecture is a hypothetical network of processes aimed at performing a task,
of which we only observe the overall time it takes under variable parameters of
the task. It is usually assumed that the network contains several processes
selectively influenced by different experimental factors, and then the question
is asked as to how these processes are arranged within the network, e.g.,
whether they are concurrent or sequential. One way of doing this is to consider
the distribution functions for the overall processing time and compute certain
linear combinations thereof (interaction contrasts). The theory of selective
influences in psychology can be viewed as a special application of the
interdisciplinary theory of (non)contextuality having its origins and main
applications in quantum theory. In particular, lack of contextuality is
equivalent to the existence of a ""hidden"" random entity of which all the random
variables in play are functions. Consequently, for any given value of this
common random entity, the processing times and their compositions (minima,
maxima, or sums) become deterministic quantities. These quantities, in turn,
can be treated as random variables with (shifted) Heaviside distribution
functions, for which one can easily compute various linear combinations across
different treatments, including interaction contrasts. This mathematical fact
leads to a simple method, more general than the previously used ones, to
investigate and characterize the interaction contrast for different types of
series-parallel architectures.

(RNL) model of plane Couette flow. This model is a computationally efficient
approximation of the second order statistical state dynamics (SSD) obtained by
partitioning the flow into a streamwise averaged mean flow and perturbations
about that mean, a closure referred to herein as the RNL$_\infty$ model. The
RNL model investigated here employs a single member of the infinite ensemble
that comprises the covariance of the RNL$_\infty$ dynamics. The RNL system has
previously been shown to support self-sustaining turbulence with a mean flow
and structural features that are consistent with DNS. This paper demonstrates
that the RNL system's self-sustaining turbulent state is supported by a small
number of streamwise varying modes, which form the natural support for the
self-sustaining process maintaining RNL turbulence. Remarkably, truncation of
the RNL system's support to a single streamwise varying mode can suffice to
sustain the turbulent state. The close correspondence between RNL simulations
and DNS that has been previously observed along with the results presented here
suggest that the fundamental mechanisms underlying wall-turbulence can be
analyzed using these highly simplified RNL systems.

known as Abell 4067, this is a unique system, where a compact bullet penetrates
an extended, low density cluster at redshift z=0.099 clearly seen from our
follow-up XMM-Newton observation. The bullet goes right through the central
region of the cluster without being disrupted and we can clearly watch the
process how the bullet component is stripped of its layers outside the core.
There is an indication of a shock heated region in the East of the cluster with
a higher temperature. The bulk temperature of the cluster is about 3.12 keV
implying a lower mass system. Spearheading the bullet is a cool core centred by
a massive early type galaxy. The temperatures and metallicities of a few

cluster, where the core of the infalling component survived the merger leaving
stripped gas behind at the centre of the main cluster. We also give an estimate

is based on a parametrical modeling of geometrically transformed textural image
fragments and maximum likelihood estimation of transformation vector between
them. Due to the parametrical approach based on the fractional Brownian motion
modeling of the local fragments texture, the proposed estimator MLfBm (ML
stands for ""Maximum Likelihood"" and fBm for ""Fractal Brownian motion"") has the
ability to better adapt to real image texture content compared to other methods
relying on universal similarity measures like mutual information or normalized
correlation. The main benefits are observed when assumptions underlying the fBm
model are fully satisfied, e.g. for isotropic normally distributed textures
with stationary increments. Experiments on both simulated and real images and
for high and weak correlation between registered images show that the MLfBm
estimator offers significant improvement compared to other state-of-the-art
methods. It reduces translation vector, rotation angle and scaling factor
estimation errors by a factor of about 1.75...2 and it decreases probability of
false match by up to 5 times. Besides, an accurate confidence interval for
MLfBm estimates can be obtained from the Cramer-Rao lower bound on
rotation-scaling-translation parameters estimation error. This bound depends on
texture roughness, noise level in reference and template images, correlation
between these images and geometrical transformation parameters.

We also investigated the detectability of LARS galaxies in current deep field

provide a comparison to stacking studies performed at high redshift. LARS
galaxies have continuum size, stellar mass, and rest-frame absolute magnitude
typical of Lyman break analogues in the local Universe and also similar to
2<z<3 star-forming galaxies and massive LAEs. LARS optical morphology is
consistent with the one of merging systems, and irregular or starburst
galaxies. For the first time we quantify the morphology in Lya images: even if
a variety of intrinsic conditions of the interstellar medium can favour the
escape of Lya photons, LARS-LAEs appear small in the continuum, and their Lya
is compact. LARS galaxies tend to be more extended in Lya than in the
rest-frame UV. It means that Lya photons escape by forming haloes around HII
regions of LARS galaxies. The stack of LARS-LAE Lya images is peaked in the
centre, indicating that the conditions, which make a galaxy an LAE, tend to
produce a concentrated surface brightness profile. On the other hand, the stack
of all LARS galaxies is shallower and more extended. This can be caused by the
variety of dust and HI amount and distribution, which produces a more complex,
patchy, and extended profile, like the one observed for Lyman break galaxies
that can contribute to the stack. We cannot identify a single morphological
property that controls whether a galaxy emits a net positive Lya flux. However,
the LARS-LAEs have continuum properties consistent with merging systems.

but powered by the heat from Dark Matter annihilation, rather than by fusion.
They are in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium, but with an unusual power
source. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), among the best candidates
for dark matter, can be their own antimatter and can annihilate inside the
star, thereby providing a heat source. Although dark matter constitutes only
$\lesssim 0.1\%$ of the stellar mass, this amount is sufficient to power the
star for millions to billions of years. Thus, the first phase of stellar
evolution in the history of the Universe may have been dark stars. We review
how dark stars come into existence, how they grow as long as dark matter fuel
persists, and their stellar structure and evolution. The studies were done in
two different ways, first assuming polytropic interiors and more recently using
the MESA stellar evolution code; the basic results are the same. Dark stars are
giant, puffy ($\sim$ 10 AU) and cool (surface temperatures $\sim$10,000 K)
objects. We follow the evolution of dark stars from their inception at $\sim 1
M_\odot$ as they accrete mass from their surroundings to become supermassive
stars, some even reaching masses $> 10^6 M_\odot$ and luminosities $>10^{10}
L_\odot$, making them detectable with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.
Once the dark matter runs out and the dark star dies, it may collapse to a
black hole; thus dark stars may provide seeds for the supermassive black holes
observed throughout the Universe and at early times. Other sites for dark star
formation may exist in the Universe today in regions of high dark matter
density such as the centers of galaxies. The current review briefly discusses
dark stars existing today, but focuses on the early generation of dark stars.

Charge transport in these heterostructures is confined to the interfaces and
occurs via variable range hopping (VRH). Upon increasing n, the interfacial
separation rises, leading to a suppression of the electrostatic screening
between carriers of neighboring interfaces and the opening of a Coulomb gap at
the Fermi level (EF). The high-field magnetoresistance (MR) is universally
negative due to progressive spin alignment. However at a critical thickness of
n=5 unit cells (u.c.), an exchange field coupling between ferromagnetically
ordered interfaces results in positive MR at low magnetic field (H). Our
results demonstrate the ability to geometrically tune the electrical transport
between regimes dominated by either charge or spin correlations.

to assess risk. We evaluated whether electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping
could improve diabetes screening, even when records are incomplete and data are
not recorded systematically across patients and practice locations. Methods: In
this cross-sectional, retrospective study, data from 9,948 US patients between
2009 and 2012 were used to develop a pre-screening tool to predict current type
2 diabetes, using multivariate logistic regression. We compared (1) a full EHR
model containing prescribed medications, diagnoses, and traditional predictive
information, (2) a restricted EHR model where medication information was
removed, and (3) a conventional model containing only traditional predictive
information (BMI, age, gender, hypertensive and smoking status). We
additionally used a random-forests classification model to judge whether
including additional EHR information could increase the ability to detect
patients with Type 2 diabetes on new patient samples. Results: Using a
patient's full or restricted EHR to detect diabetes was superior to using basic
covariates alone (p<0.001). The random forests model replicated on out-of-bag
data. Migraines and cardiac dysrhythmias were negatively associated with type 2
diabetes, while acute bronchitis and herpes zoster were positively associated,

detection of type 2 diabetes in a general US population, could increase the
efficiency and accuracy of disease screening, and are capable of picking up

challenges for emerging wireless small cell networks (SCNs). In this regard,
millimeter wave (mmW) communication technologies have recently emerged as an
attractive solution to realize the vision of a high-speed and reliable wireless
small cell backhaul network (SCBN). In this paper, a novel approach is proposed
for managing the spectral resources of a heterogeneous SCBN that can exploit
simultaneously mmW and conventional frequency bands via carrier aggregation. In
particular, a new SCBN model is proposed in which small cell base stations
(SCBSs) equipped with broadband fiber backhaul allocate their frequency
resources to SCBSs with wireless backhaul, by using aggregated bands. One
unique feature of the studied model is that it jointly accounts for both
wireless channel characteristics and economic factors during resource
allocation. The problem is then formulated as a one-to-many matching game and a
distributed algorithm is proposed to find a stable outcome of the game. The
convergence of the algorithm is proven and the properties of the resulting
matching are studied. Simulation results show that under the constraints of
wireless backhauling, the proposed approach achieves substantial performance
gains, reaching up to $30 \%$ compared to a conventional best-effort approach.

2012, 12, 5133-5137) that reports the flow-triggered deformation of bacterial
biofilms, formed on cylindrical rigid microposts, into long filamentous
structures known as streamers. In our analysis, we consider an elastic body of
finite thickness (forming a rim) placed over a rigid cylinder, i.e., we mimic
the biofilm structure in the experiment. We consider Oseen flow solution to
describe the low Reynolds transport past this cylindrical elastic structure.
The stress and strain distributions inside the elastic structure are found to
be functions of position, Poisson ratio, initial thickness of the elastic rim
and the ratio of the flow-driven shear stress to the shear modulus of the
elastic body. More importantly, these analyses, which can be deemed as one of
the first formal analyses to understand the fluid-structure-interaction issues
associated with the biofilm streamer formation, help us interpret several
qualitative aspects associated with the streamer formation reported in
different experiments.

doping Mott insulators, where a central question is what mechanism causes the
loss of electrical resistance below the superconducting (SC) transition
temperature? In this review, we attempt to summarize the basic idea of the
kinetic-energy driven SC mechanism in the description of superconductivity in
cuprate superconductors. The mechanism of the kinetic-energy driven
superconductivity is purely electronic without phonons, where the
charge-carrier pairing interaction arises directly from the kinetic energy by
the exchange of spin excitations in the higher powers of the doping
concentration. This kinetic-energy driven d-wave SC-state is controlled by both
the SC gap and quasiparticle coherence, which leads to that the maximal SC
transition temperature occurs around the optimal doping, and then decreases in
both the underdoped and overdoped regimes. In particular, the same
charge-carrier interaction mediated by spin excitations that induces the
SC-state in the particle-particle channel also generates the normal-state
pseudogap state in the particle-hole channel. The normal-state pseudogap
crossover temperature is much larger than the SC transition temperature in the
underdoped and optimally doped regimes, and then monotonically decreases upon
the increase of doping, eventually disappearing together with superconductivity
at the end of the SC dome. This kinetic-energy driven SC mechanism also
indicates that the strong electron correlation favors superconductivity, since
the main ingredient is identified into a charge-carrier pairing mechanism not
from the external degree of freedom such as the phonon but rather solely from
the internal spin degree of freedom of the electron. The typical properties of
cuprate superconductors discussed within the framework of the kinetic-energy
driven SC mechanism are also reviewed.

Electroluminescence studies demonstrate prominent direct bandgap excitonic

Importantly, the electroluminescence efficiency observed in multi-layer MoS2 is
comparable to or even higher than that in monolayers, corresponding to a
relative electroluminescence enhancement factor of >1000 in multi-layer MoS2
when compared to its photoluminescence. This striking enhancement of
electroluminescence can be attributed to the high electric field induced
carrier redistribution from low energy points (indirect bandgap) to high energy
points (direct bandgap) of k-space, arising from the unique band structure of
MoS2 with a much higher density of states at high energy points. The electric

complexity but gives inferior performance in general. To improve performance
and provide new BF decoder options for complexity-performance tradeoffs, we
propose new designs for the flipping function (FF), the flipped bit selection

checksum weights in every iteration while our FBS rules take more information
into account. These two modifications represent efforts to track more closely
the evolutions of both check and variable nodes' reliabilities. Two selective

tradeoffs.
  The combinations of the new FBS rule and known FFs result in new BF decoders
with improved performance and a modest complexity increase. On the other hand,
combining the new FF and FBS rule gives a new decoder with performance

technique with an emphasis on its performance enhancement employing
multi-antenna techniques. Compared to traditional wireless information
transmission, WIPT faces numerous challenges. First, it is more susceptible to
channel fading and path loss, resulting in a much shorter power transfer
distance. Second, it gives rise to the issue on how to balance spectral
efficiency for information transmission and energy efficiency for power
transfer in order to obtain an optimal tradeoff. Third, there exists a security
issue for information transmission in order to improve power transfer
efficiency. In this context, multi-antenna techniques, e.g., energy
beamforming, are introduced to solve these problems by exploiting spatial
degree of freedom. This article provides a tutorial on various aspects of
multi-antenna based WIPT techniques, with a focus on tackling the challenges by
parameter optimization and protocol design. In particular, we investigate the
WIPT tradeoffs based on two typical multi-antenna techniques, namely limited
feedback multi-antenna technique for short-distance transfer and large-scale
multiple-input multiple-output (LS-MIMO, also known as massive MIMO) technique
for long-distance transfer. Finally, simulation results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

new bounds that characterize the relationship of the parameters $R$, $N$,
$P_e$, and the quality of the channel $W$ quantified by its capacity $I(W)$ and
its Bhattacharyya parameter $Z(W)$.
  In previous work, two main regimes were studied. In the error exponent
regime, the channel $W$ and the rate $R<I(W)$ are fixed, and it was proved that
the error probability $P_e$ scales roughly as $2^{-\sqrt{N}}$. In the scaling
exponent approach, the channel $W$ and the error probability $P_e$ are fixed
and it was proved that the gap to capacity $I(W)-R$ scales as $N^{-1/\mu}$.
Here, $\mu$ is called scaling exponent and this scaling exponent depends on the
channel $W$. A heuristic computation for the binary erasure channel (BEC) gives
$\mu=3.627$ and it was shown that, for any channel $W$, $3.579 \le \mu \le
5.702$.
  Our contributions are as follows. First, we provide the tighter upper bound
$\mu \le 4.714$ valid for any $W$. With the same technique, we obtain $\mu \le
3.639$ for the case of the BEC, which approaches very closely its heuristically
derived value. Second, we develop a trade-off between the gap to capacity
$I(W)-R$ and the error probability $P_e$ as functions of the block length $N$.
In other words, we consider a moderate deviations regime in which we study how
fast both quantities, as functions of the block length $N$, simultaneously go
to $0$. Third, we prove that polar codes are not affected by error floors. To
do so, we fix a polar code of block length $N$ and rate $R$. Then, we vary the
channel $W$ and we show that the error probability $P_e$ scales as the
Bhattacharyya parameter $Z(W)$ raised to a power that scales roughly like
$\sqrt{N}$.

Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory for treating the weakly interacting
electrons on a static mean-field level with non-perturbative many-body methods
for the strongly interacting electrons in the open $d$- and $f$-shells. An
effective description of the strongly interacting electrons in terms of a
multi-orbital Anderson impurity model is obtained by projection onto the
strongly correlated subspace properly taking into account the non-orthogonality
of the atomic basis set. A special focus lies on the ab initio calculation of
the effective screened interaction matrix U for the Anderson model. Solution of
the effective Anderson model with the One-Crossing approximation or other
impurity solver techniques yields the dynamic correlations within the strongly
correlated subspace giving rise e.g. to the Kondo effect. As an example the
method is applied to the case of a Co adatom on the Cu(001) surface. The
calculated low-bias tunnel spectra show Fano-Kondo lineshapes similar to those
measured in experiments. The exact shape of the Fano-Kondo feature as well as
its width depend quite strongly on the filling of the Co $3d$-shell. Although
this somewhat hampers accurate quantitative predictions regarding lineshapes
and Kondo temperatures, the overall physical situation can be predicted quite
reliably.

performed in immobilized and freely swimming larvae and in adult zebrafish
brains demonstrate, for the first time, the fundamental ability to
optoacoustically track neural calcium dynamics in animals labeled with
genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5G, while overcoming the
longstanding penetration barrier of optical imaging in scattering brains. The
newly developed platform offers unprecedented capabilities for functional

increasing of magnetic order corresponds to varying these parameters and
consequently, drives topological transitions. At the mean-field level, one
scenario is that the magnetic order continuously increases, and inevitably, the
fermion gap closes at the topological transition point with nonzero magnetic
order. Beyond the mean-field, interaction between fermions mediated by
spin-wave fluctuations can further open up the gap, rendering a first-order
transition. Another scenario is a first-order transition at mean-field level
across which a canted magnetic order develops discontinuously, avoiding the
fermion gap closing. We find that both scenarios exist in the phase diagram of
the Haldane-Hubbard model. Our predication is relevant to recent experimental
realization of the Haldane model in cold atom system.

attractive in future distance scale work to derive distances beyond the limit

ULPCs in M31, using the single-band data taken from the Palomar Transient

the VI-band follow-up observations of these eight candidates. Based on our
VI-band light curves of these candidates and their locations in the

candidates as being truly ULPCs. The six other candidates are most likely other

applicability of ULPCs in distance scale work by deriving the distance modulus
of M31. It was found to be $\mu_{M31,ULPC}=24.30\pm0.76$ mag. The large error
in the derived distance modulus, together with the large intrinsic dispersion
of the Period-Wesenheit (PW) relation and the small number of ULPCs in a given

idea reflected in the density scaling power law, ${\tau}_{\alpha}=f(T^{-1}

emission lines and associated line intensities are also found to vary with
evolutionary stages. We developed various 3D models for HMCs guided by the
evolutionary scenarios proposed by recent empirical and modeling studies. We
then investigated the spatio-temporal variation of temperature and molecular
abundances in HMCs by consistently coupling gas-grain chemical evolution with
radiative transfer calculations. We explored the effects of varying physical
conditions on molecular abundances including density distribution and
luminosity evolution of the central protostar(s). The time-dependent
temperature structure of the hot core models provides a realistic framework for
investigating the spatial variation of ice mantle evaporation as a function of
evolutionary timescales. With increasing protostellar luminosity, the water ice
evaporation font ($\sim$100K) expands and the spatial distribution of gas phase
abundances of these COMs also spreads out. We simulated the synthetic spectra
for these models at different evolutionary timescales to compare with
observations. A qualitative comparison of the simulated and observed spectra
suggests that these self-consistent hot core models can reproduce the notable
trends in hot core spectral variation within the typical hot core timescales of
10$^{5}$ year. These models predict that the spatial distribution of various
emission line maps will also expand with evolutionary time. The model
predictions can be compared with high resolution observation that can probe
scales of a few thousand AU in high-mass star forming regions such as from
ALMA.[Abridged]

  on Salient Object Detection",,"PLoS ONE 10 (2015)","10.1371/journal.pone.0130316",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has become apparent that a Gaussian center bias can serve as an important
prior for visual saliency detection, which has been demonstrated for predicting
human eye fixations and salient object detection. Tseng et al. have shown that
the photographer's tendency to place interesting objects in the center is a
likely cause for the center bias of eye fixations. We investigate the influence
of the photographer's center bias on salient object detection, extending our
previous work. We show that the centroid locations of salient objects in
photographs of Achanta and Liu's data set in fact correlate strongly with a
Gaussian model. This is an important insight, because it provides an empirical
motivation and justification for the integration of such a center bias in
salient object detection algorithms and helps to understand why Gaussian models
are so effective. To assess the influence of the center bias on salient object
detection, we integrate an explicit Gaussian center bias model into two
state-of-the-art salient object detection algorithms. This way, first, we
quantify the influence of the Gaussian center bias on pixel- and segment-based
salient object detection. Second, we improve the performance in terms of F1
score, Fb score, area under the recall-precision curve, area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve, and hit-rate on the well-known data set by
Achanta and Liu. Third, by debiasing Cheng et al.'s region contrast model, we
exemplarily demonstrate that implicit center biases are partially responsible
for the outstanding performance of state-of-the-art algorithms. Last but not
least, as a result of debiasing Cheng et al.'s algorithm, we introduce a
non-biased salient object detection method, which is of interest for
applications in which the image data is not likely to have a photographer's
center bias (e.g., image data of surveillance cameras or autonomous robots).

  computational study",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn cs.CE physics.ao-ph physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The engineering interest about dune fields is dictated by the their
interaction with a number of human infrastructures in arid environments. Sand
dunes dynamics is dictated by wind and its ability to induce sand erosion,
transport and deposition. A deep understanding of dune aerodynamics serves then
to ground effective strategies for the protection of human infrastructures from
sand, the so-called sand mitigation. Because of their simple geometry and their
frequent occurrence in desert area, transverse sand dunes are usually adopted
in literature as a benchmark to investigate dune aerodynamics by means of both
computational or experimental approaches, usually in nominally 2D setups. The
present study aims at evaluating 3D flow features in the wake of a idealised
transverse dune, if any, under different nominally 2D setup conditions by means
of computational simulations and to compare the obtained results with
experimental measurements available in literature.

  arXiv:1501.02038",,,,"cs.FL cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Formal languages let us define the textual representation of data with
precision. Formal grammars, typically in the form of BNF-like productions,
describe the language syntax, which is then annotated for syntax-directed
translation and completed with semantic actions. When, apart from the textual
representation of data, an explicit representation of the corresponding data
structure is required, the language designer has to devise the mapping between
the suitable data model and its proper language specification, and then develop
the conversion procedure from the parse tree to the data model instance.
Unfortunately, whenever the format of the textual representation has to be
modified, changes have to propagated throughout the entire language processor
tool chain. These updates are time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone.
Besides, in case different applications use the same language, several copies
of the same language specification have to be maintained. In this paper, we
introduce ModelCC, a model-based parser generator that decouples language
specification from language processing, hence avoiding many of the problems
caused by grammar-driven parsers and parser generators. ModelCC incorporates
reference resolution within the parsing process. Therefore, instead of
returning mere abstract syntax trees, ModelCC is able to obtain abstract syntax
graphs from input strings.

description of a relativistic particle with spin can be used to construct
spinors and tensors of arbitrary rank, with invariant decomposition over
angular momentum. In particular, scalar and vector fields, as well as the
representations of their transformations, are constructed. The method that is
developed here admits the construction of wave packets and states of a many
body relativistic system with definite total angular momentum. Furthermore, a
Pauli-Lubanski operator is constructed on the orbit of the induced
representation which provides a Casimir operator for the Poincar\'e group and
which contains the physical intrinsic angular momentum of the particle
covariantly.
