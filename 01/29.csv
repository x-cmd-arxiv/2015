history of the evolution of the magnet design and construction, we review the
main characteristics of the accelerator magnets having an impact on the
construction technology. We put in evidence how the design and component
quality impact on construction and why the final product calls for a
total-quality approach. LHC experience is widely discussed and main lessons are
spelled out. Then the new Nb3Sn technology, under development for the next

the cold phase of the local interstellar medium through rapid chemical
reactions. We present here the first systematic study of this relation at high
redshifts using H$_2$-bearing damped Ly$\alpha$ systems (DLAs) detected along
quasar lines of sight. Using high-resolution spectroscopic data from VLT/UVES
and Keck/HIRES, we report the detection of Cl$\,$I in 9 DLAs (including 5 new

(including a new H$_2$ detection at $z=3.09145$ towards J$\,$2100$-$0641) and
present upper limits for the remaining 9 systems. We find a $\sim$5$\,\sigma$
correlation between $N$(Cl$\,$I) and $N$(H$_2$) with only $\sim$0.2$\,$dex
dispersion over the range 18.1$\,<\,$log$\,N$(H$_2$)$\,<\,$20.1, thus probing
column densities 10 times lower those seen towards nearby stars, roughly
following the relation $N$(Cl$\,$I$) \approx 1.5\times10^{-6} \times N($H$_2)$.
This relation between column densities is surprisingly the same at low and high
redshift suggesting that the physical and chemical conditions are similar for a
given H$_2$ (or Cl$\,$I) column density. In turn, the $N({Cl$\,$I})/N({\rm
H_2})$ ratio is found to be uncorrelated with the overall metallicity in the
DLA. Our results confirm that neutral chlorine is an excellent tracer of
molecule-rich gas and show that the molecular fraction or/and metallicity in
the H$_2$-bearing component of DLA could possibly be much higher than the
line-of-sight average values usually measured in DLAs.

the tangent spaces to \Sigma and to the orbit, T_{(\Sigma,A)}, T_{(GA,A)} , and
their quotient, the tangent module to the miniversal deformation. In
particular, the order of determinacy is controlled by the annihilator of this

astrophysics and engineering. The extreme plasma parameters in these
environments, e.g. high Reynolds numbers, supersonic and super-Alfvenic flows,
however, make direct numerical simulations computationally intractable even for
the simplest treatment -- magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). To overcome this problem
one can use subgrid-scale (SGS) closures -- models for the influence of
unresolved, subgrid-scales on the resolved ones. In this work we propose and
validate a set of constant coefficient closures for the resolved, compressible,
ideal MHD equations. The subgrid-scale energies are modeled by Smagorinsky-like
equilibrium closures. The turbulent stresses and the electromotive force (EMF)
are described by expressions that are nonlinear in terms of large scale
velocity and magnetic field gradients. To verify the closures we conduct a
priori tests over 137 simulation snapshots from two different codes with
varying ratios of thermal to magnetic pressure ($\beta_\mathrm{p} = 0.25, 1,
2.5, 5, 25$) and sonic Mach numbers ($M_s = 2, 2.5, 4$). Furthermore, we make a
comparison to traditional, phenomenological eddy-viscosity and
$\alpha-\beta-\gamma$ closures. We find only mediocre performance of the
kinetic eddy-viscosity and $\alpha-\beta-\gamma$ closures, and that the
magnetic eddy-viscosity closure is poorly correlated with the simulation data.
Moreover, three of five coefficients of the traditional closures exhibit a
significant spread in values. In contrast, our new closures demonstrate
consistently high correlation and constant coefficient values over time and and
over the wide range of parameters tested. Important aspects in compressible MHD
turbulence such as the bi-directional energy cascade, turbulent magnetic
pressure and proper alignment of the EMF are well described by our new
closures.

constraint solving in symbolic execution. Most of the existing reuse approaches
are based on syntactic or semantic equivalence of constraints; e.g. the Green
framework is able to reuse constraints which have different representations but
are semantically equivalent, through canonizing constraints into syntactically
equivalent normal forms. However, syntactic/semantic equivalence is not a
necessary condition for reuse--some constraints are not syntactically or
semantically equivalent, but their solutions still have potential for reuse.
Existing approaches are unable to recognize and reuse such constraints.
  In this paper, we present GreenTrie, an extension to the Green framework,
which supports constraint reuse based on the logical implication relations
among constraints. GreenTrie provides a component, called L-Trie, which stores
constraints and solutions into tries, indexed by an implication partial order
graph of constraints. L-Trie is able to carry out logical reduction and logical
subset and superset querying for given constraints, to check for reuse of
previously solved constraints. We report the results of an experimental
assessment of GreenTrie against the original Green framework, which shows that
our extension achieves better reuse of constraint solving result and saves
significant symbolic execution time.

superluminal signals capable of enabling communication are necessarily
exchanged in any quantum theory that posits hidden superluminal influences.
However, does the presence of hidden superluminal influences automatically
imply superluminal signalling and communication? The non-signalling theorem
mediates the apparent conflict between quantum mechanics and the theory of
special relativity. However, as a 'no-go' theorem there exist two opposing
interpretations of the non-signalling constraint: foundational and operational.
Concerning Bell's theorem, we argue that Bell employed both interpretations at
different times. Bell finally pursued an explicitly operational position on
non-signalling which is often associated with ontological quantum theory, e.g.,
de Broglie-Bohm theory. This position we refer to as ""effective
non-signalling"". By contrast, associated with orthodox quantum mechanics is the
foundational position referred to here as ""axiomatic non-signalling"". In search
of a decisive communication-theoretic criterion for differentiating between
""axiomatic"" and ""effective"" non-signalling, we employ the operational framework
offered by Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. We find that an
effective non-signalling theorem represents two sub-theorems, which we call (1)
non-transfer-control (NTC) theorem, and (2) non-signification-control (NSC)
theorem. Employing NTC and NSC theorems, we report that effective, instead of
axiomatic, non-signalling is entirely sufficient for prohibiting nonlocal
communication. An effective non-signalling theorem allows for nonlocal quantum
information transfer yet - at the same time - effectively denies superluminal
signalling and communication.

central kinematically-decoupled component. The negative metallicity gradient
found in our bulges sample indicates a relevant role for the dissipative
collapse in bulge formation. However, the shallow gradients found for the age
and {\alpha}/Fe ratio suggests that merging can not be completely ruled out for
the sample bulges. This is confirmed by the properties of ESO-LV 4500200 which
can hardly be explained without invoking the capture of external material.

  Improve Template Matching for RDF graphs",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Signature-based pruning is broadly accepted as an effective way to improve
query performance of graph template matching on general labeled graphs. Most
existing techniques which utilize signature-based pruning claim its benefits on
all datasets and queries. However, the effectiveness of signature-based pruning
varies greatly among different RDF datasets and highly related with their
dataset characteristics. We observe that the performance benefits from
signature-based pruning depend not only on the size of the RDF graphs, but also
the underlying graph structure and the complexity of queries. This motivates us
to propose a flexible RDF querying framework, called RDF-h, which selectively
utilizes signature-based pruning by evaluating the characteristics of RDF
datasets and query templates. Scalability and efficiency of RDF-h is
demonstrated in experimental results using both real and synthetic datasets.

state into a polarized state. In contrast, motility arrest is associated with
re-symmetrization of the internal configuration of a cell. Experiments on
keratocytes suggest that polarization is triggered by the increased
contractility of motor proteins but the conditions of re-symmetrization remain
unknown. In this paper we show that if adhesion with the extra-cellular
substrate is sufficiently low, the progressive intensification of motor-induced
contraction may be responsible for both transitions: from static (symmetric) to
motile (polarized) at a lower contractility threshold and from motile
(polarized) back to static (symmetric) at a higher contractility threshold. Our
model of lamellipodial cell motility is based on a 1D projection of the complex
intra-cellular dynamics on the direction of locomotion. In the interest of
analytical transparency we also neglect active protrusion and view adhesion as
passive. Despite the unavoidable oversimplifications associated with these
assumptions, the model reproduces quantitatively the motility initiation
pattern in fish keratocytes and reveals a crucial role played in cell motility
by the nonlocal feedback between the mechanics and the transport of active
agents. A prediction of the model that a crawling cell can stop and
re-symmetrize when contractility increases sufficiently far beyond the motility
initiation threshold still awaits experimental verification.

is shown through a novel analysis based upon analysing pairs of particle
trajectories in a frame of reference moving with the large energy containing
scales of motion that the normalized integrated error $e^I_K$ in the turbulent
pair diffusivity ($K$) due to the sweeping effect decreases with increasing
pair separation ($\sigma_l$), such that $e^I_K\to 0$ as $\sigma_l/\eta\to
\infty$; and $e^I_K\to \infty$ as $\sigma_l/\eta\to 0$. $\eta$ is the
Kolmogorov turbulence microscale. There is an intermediate range of separations
$1<\sigma_l/\eta< \infty$ in which the error $e^I_K$ remains negligible.
Simulations using KS shows that in the swept frame of reference, this
intermediate range is large covering almost the entire inertial subrange
simulated, $1<\sigma_l/\eta< 10^5$, implying that the deviation from locality
observed in KS therefore cannot be atributed to sweeping errors and could be
real. This is important for pair diffusion theory and modeling.

as an active continuum layer. The main active processes in this layer are
protrusion, originating from non-equilibrium polymerization of actin fibers,
contraction, induced by myosin molecular motors and attachment due to active
bonding of trans-membrane proteins to a substrate. All three active mechanisms
are regulated by complex signaling pathways involving chemical and mechanical
feedback loops whose microscopic functioning is still poorly understood. In
this situation, it is instructive to take a reverse engineering approach and
study a problem of finding the spatial organization of standard active elements
inside a crawling layer ensuring an optimal cost-performance trade-off. In this
paper we assume that (in the range of interest) the energetic cost of
self-propulsion is velocity independent and adopt, as an optimality criterion,
the maximization of the overall velocity. We then choose a prototypical
setting, formulate the corresponding variational problem and obtain a set of
bounds suggesting that radically different spatial distributions of adhesive
complexes would be optimal depending on the domineering active mechanism of
self-propulsion. Thus, for contraction-dominated motility, adhesion has to
cooperate with 'pullers' which localize at the trailing edge of the cell, while
for protrusion-dominated motility it must conspire with 'pushers' concentrating
at the leading edge of the cell. Both types of crawling mechanisms were
observed experimentally.

relation to a hydromagnetic dynamo operating in the progenitor during shell
burning phases. The downward pumping of angular momentum in the convective
envelope, in combination with the absorption of a planet or tidal spin-up from
a binary companion, can trigger strong dynamo action near the core-envelope
boundary. Several arguments point to the outer core as the source for a
magnetic field in the WD remnant: the outer third of a $\sim 0.55\,M_\odot$ WD
is processed during the shell burning phase(s) of the progenitor; the escape of
magnetic helicity through the envelope mediates the growth of (compensating)
helicity in the core, as is needed to maintain a stable magnetic field in the
remnant; and the intense radiation flux at the core boundary facilitates
magnetic buoyancy within a relatively thick tachocline layer. The helicity flux
into the growing core is driven by a dynamical imbalance with a
latitude-dependent rotational stress. The magnetic field deposited in an
isolated massive WD is concentrated in an outer shell of mass $\lesssim
0.1\,M_\odot$ and can reach $\sim 10\,$MG. A buried toroidal field experiences
moderate ohmic decay above an age $\sim 0.3$ Gyr, which may lead to growth or
decay of the external magnetic field. The final WD spin period is related to a
critical spin rate below which magnetic activity shuts off, and core and
envelope decouple; it generally sits in the range of hours to days. WD periods
ranging up to a year are possible if the envelope re-expands following a late
thermal pulse.

been developed following the adaptive force matching (AFM) method that provides
excellent predictions of water properties with only electronic structure
information as a reference. Compared to many other electronic structure based
force fields that rely on fairly sophisticated energy expressions, the AFM
water models use point-charge based energy expressions that are supported by
most popular molecular dynamics packages. An outstanding question regarding
simple force fields is whether such force fields provide reasonable
transferability outside of their conditions of parameterization. A survey of
three AFM water models, B3LYPD-4F, BLYPSP-4F, and WAIL are provided for
simulations under conditions ranging from the melting point up to the critical
point. By including ice-Ih configurations in the training set, the WAIL
potential predicts the melting temperate, TM, of ice-Ih correctly. Without
training for ice, BLYPSP-4F underestimates TM by about 15 K. Interestingly, the
B3LYPD-4F model gives a TM 14 K too high. The overestimation of TM by B3LYPD-4F
mostly likely reflects a deficiency of the B3LYP reference. The BLYPSP-4F model
gives the best estimate of the boiling temperature TB and is arguably the best
potential for simulating water in the temperature range from TM to TB. None of
the three AFM potentials provides a good description of the critical point.
Although the B3LYPD-4F model gives the correct critical temperature TC and
critical density, there are good reasons to believe the agreement is reached
fortuitously. Links to Gromacs input files for the three water models are

molecular cloud does not cover the background source completely. The partial
coverage reveals itself as a residual flux in the bottom of saturated H_2
absorption lines. This amounts to about (2.22$\pm$0.54)% of the continuum and
does not depend on the wavelength. This value is small and it explains why this
effect has not been detected in previous studies of this quasar spectrum.
However, it is robustly detected and significantly higher than the zero flux
level in the bottom of saturated lines of the Ly-alpha forest,
(-0.21$\pm$0.22)%. The presence of the residual flux could be caused by
unresolved quasar multicomponents, by light scattered by dust, and/or by
jet-cloud interaction. The H$_2$ absorption system is very well described by a
two-component model without inclusion of additional components when we take
partial coverage into account. The derived total column densities in the H$_2$
absorption components A and B are logN(H$_2$)[cm$^{-2}$] = 18.10$\pm$0.02 and
17.82$\pm$0.02, respectively. HD molecules are present only in component B.
Given the column density, logN(HD)= 13.33$\pm$0.02, we find
N(HD)/2N(H$_2$)=(1.48$\pm$0.10)x10$^{-5}$, significantly lower than previous
estimations. We argue that it is crucial to take into account partial coverage

introduce monadic second-order logic interpreted over coalgebras for an

automata, relative to the class of coalgebras that admit a tree-like supporting
Kripke frame. We then consider invariance under behavioral equivalence of
formulas; more in particular, we investigate whether the coalgebraic
mu-calculus is the bisimulation-invariant fragment of monadic second-order
logic. Building on recent results by the third author we show that in order to
provide such a coalgebraic generalization of the Janin-Walukiewicz Theorem, it
suffices to find what we call an adequate uniform construction for the functor.
As applications of this result we obtain a partly new proof of the
Janin-Walukiewicz Theorem, and bisimulation invariance results for the bag
functor (graded modal logic) and all exponential polynomial functors.
  Finally, we consider in some detail the monotone neighborhood functor, which
provides coalgebraic semantics for monotone modal logic. It turns out that
there is no adequate uniform construction for this functor, whence the
automata-theoretic approach towards bisimulation invariance does not apply

evolution is calculated using model stars of initial mass 1, 1.5 and
$5\,M_\odot$, taking into account mass loss on the giant branches. We also
include the deposition of orbital angular momentum from a sub-stellar
companion, as influenced by tidal drag along with the excitation of orbital
eccentricity by a fluctuating gravitational quadrupole moment. A range of
angular velocity profiles $\Omega(r)$ is considered in the envelope, extending
from solid rotation to constant specific angular momentum. We focus on the back
reaction of the Coriolis force, and the threshold for dynamo action in the
inner envelope. Quantitative agreement with measurements of core rotation in
subgiants and post-He core flash stars by Kepler is obtained with a two-layer
angular velocity profile: uniform specific angular momentum where the Coriolis
parameter ${\rm Co} \equiv \Omega \tau_{\rm con} \lesssim 1$ (here $\tau_{\rm
con}$ is the convective time); and $\Omega(r) \propto r^{-1}$ where ${\rm Co}
\gtrsim 1$. The inner profile is interpreted in terms of a balance between the
Coriolis force and angular pressure gradients driven by radially extended
convective plumes. Inward angular momentum pumping reduces the surface rotation
of subgiants, and the need for a rejuvenated magnetic wind torque. The
co-evolution of internal magnetic fields and rotation is considered in Kissin &

Additionally they are chosen in such a way that all DAs of a certain symmetry

Hookean springs that are placed along the edges of a triangulation of the
biofilm region. The interfacial shear stress, lift and drag forces acting on
the biofilm colony are computed by using fluid stress jump method developed by
Williams, Fauci and Gaver [Disc. Contin. Dyn. Sys. B 11(2):519-540, 2009], with
a modified version of their exclusion filter. Our detachment criterion is based
on the novel concept of an averaged equivalent continuum stress tensor defined
at each IB point in the biofilm which is then used to determine a corresponding
von Mises yield stress; wherever this yield stress exceeds a given critical
threshold the connections to that node are severed, thereby signalling the
onset of a detachment event. In order to capture the deformation and detachment
behaviour of a biofilm colony at different stages of growth, we consider a
family of four biofilm shapes with varying aspect ratio. Our numerical
simulations focus on the behaviour of weak biofilms (with relatively low yield
stress threshold) and investigate features of the fluid-structure interaction
such as locations of maximum shear and increased drag. The most important
conclusion of this work is that the commonly employed detachment strategy in
biofilm models based only on interfacial shear stress can lead to incorrect or
inaccurate results when applied to the study of shear induced detachment of
weak biofilms. Our detachment strategy based on equivalent continuum stresses
provides a unified and consistent IB framework that handles both sloughing and
erosion modes of biofilm detachment, and is consistent with strategies employed

images of objects made from light materials. However, limited by absorption

Here we show via simulation that muon beams can provide high resolution
tomographic images of dense objects and of structures within the interior of
dense objects. The effects of resolution broadening from multiple scattering
diminish with increasing muon momentum. As the momentum of the muon increases,
the contrast of the image goes down and therefore requires higher resolution in
the muon spectrometer to resolve the image. The variance of the measured muon
momentum reaches a minimum and then increases with increasing muon momentum.
The impact of the increase in variance is to require a higher integrated muon
flux to reduce fluctuations. The flux requirements and level of contrast needed
for high resolution muon computed tomography are well matched to the muons
produced in the pion decay pipe at a neutrino beam facility and what can be
achieved for momentum resolution in a muon spectrometer. Such an imaging system
can be applied in archaeology, art history, engineering, material

constituents of the Earth's atmosphere leads to the formation of telluric
absorption lines in ground-based collected spectra. Correcting for these lines,
mostly affecting the red and infrared region of the spectrum, usually relies on
observations of specific stars obtained close in time and airmass to the
science targets, therefore using precious observing time. Aims: We present
molecfit, a tool for correcting for telluric absorption lines based on
synthetic modelling of the Earth's atmospheric transmission. Molecfit is
versatile and can be used with data obtained with various ground-based
telescopes and instruments. Methods: Molecfit combines a publicly available
radiative transfer code, a molecular line database, atmospheric profiles, and
various kernels to model the instrument line spread function. The atmospheric
profiles are created by merging a standard atmospheric profile representative
of a given observatory's climate, of local meteorological data, and of
dynamically retrieved altitude profiles for temperature, pressure, and
humidity. We discuss the various ingredients of the method, its applicability,
and its limitations. We also show examples of telluric line correction on
spectra obtained with a suite of ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments.
Results: Compared to previous similar tools, molecfit takes the best results
for temperature, pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere above the observatory
into account. As a result, the standard deviation of the residuals after
correction of unsaturated telluric lines is frequently better than 2% of the
continuum. Conclusion: Molecfit is able to accurately model and correct for
telluric lines over a broad range of wavelengths and spectral resolutions.

addition to extend the analysis for log-concave distributions to approximate

orientifold of T^6/(Z2xZ2), we propose a modular invariant dimensional
oxidation of the four-dimensional scalar potential. In the oxidized
ten-dimensional supergravity action, the standard NS-NS and RR three form
fluxes (H-, F-) as well as the non-geometric fluxes (Q-, P-) are found to
nicely rearrange themselves to form generalized flux-combinations. As an
application towards moduli stabilization, using the same S-duality invariant
scalar potential, we examine the recently proposed No-Go theorem (in
arXiv:1409.7075) about creating a mass-hierarchy between universal-axion and
the dilaton relevant for axionic-inflation. Considering a two-field dynamics of
universal axion and dilaton while assuming the other moduli/axions being
stabilized, we find a part of the No-Go arguments to be quite robust even with
the inclusion of non-geometric (Q-, P-) fluxes.

FMAP is specifically aimed at solving problems that require cooperation among
agents, the flexibility of the domain-independent planning model allows FMAP to
tackle multi-agent planning tasks of any type. In FMAP, agents jointly explore
the plan space by building up refinement plans through a complete and flexible
forward-chaining partial-order planner. The search is guided by $h_{DTG}$, a
novel heuristic function that is based on the concepts of Domain Transition
Graph and frontier state and is optimized to evaluate plans in distributed
environments. Agents in FMAP apply an advanced privacy model that allows them
to adequately keep private information while communicating only the data of the
refinement plans that is relevant to each of the participating agents.
Experimental results show that FMAP is a general-purpose approach that
efficiently solves tightly-coupled domains that have specialized agents and
cooperative goals as well as loosely-coupled problems. Specifically, the
empirical evaluation shows that FMAP outperforms current MAP systems at solving
complex planning tasks that are adapted from the International Planning

decomposition into a sum of rank-$1$ tensors. We find new mild deterministic
conditions for the uniqueness of individual rank-$1$ tensors in CPD and present
an algorithm to recover them. We call the algorithm ""algebraic"" because it
relies only on standard linear algebra. It does not involve more advanced
procedures than the computation of the null space of a matrix and
eigen/singular value decomposition. Simulations indicate that the new
conditions for uniqueness and the working assumptions for the algorithm hold
for a randomly generated $I\times J\times K$ tensor of rank $R\geq K\geq J\geq
I\geq 2$ if $R$ is bounded as $R\leq (I+J+K-2)/2 + (K-\sqrt{(I-J)^2+4K})/2$ at
least for the dimensions that we have tested. This improves upon the famous
Kruskal bound for uniqueness $R\leq (I+J+K-2)/2$ as soon as $I\geq 3$.
  In the particular case $R=K$, the new bound above is equivalent to the bound
$R\leq(I-1)(J-1)$ which is known to be necessary and sufficient for the generic
uniqueness of the CPD. An existing algebraic algorithm (based on simultaneous
diagonalization of a set of matrices) computes the CPD under the more
restrictive constraint $R(R-1)\leq I(I-1)J(J-1)/2$ (implying that
$R<(J-\frac{1}{2})(I-\frac{1}{2})/\sqrt{2}+1$). On the other hand,
optimization-based algorithms fail to compute the CPD in a reasonable amount of
time even in the low-dimensional case $I=3$, $J=7$, $K=R=12$. By comparison, in
our approach the computation takes less than $1$ sec. We demonstrate that, at
least for $R\leq 24$, our algorithm can recover the rank-$1$ tensors in the CPD
up to $R\leq(I-1)(J-1)$.

that if a magnetic field is tilted with respect to the film normal, a critical
transition from the inhomogeneous magnetic state of granules with noncollinear
directions of their moments to the homogeneous one with parallel orientation of
granular magnetic moments takes place. The in-plane anisotropy is found to
affect the angular dependence of the critical field. The ensemble of oriented
biaxial particles is theoretically described in the double-well potential
approximation. Despite the biaxial magnetic anisotropy of particles, their
ensemble, if in the inhomogeneous state, is divided into two subensembles, with
the magnetic moments of particles being collinear in each of them. In the
critical field, a transition from the inhomogeneous state with two subensembles
into the homogeneous one takes place. The results of theoretical calculations
are compared with experimental data for a nanogranular Co/Al2On film with
perpendicular anisotropy containing 74.5 at.% Co, which exceeds the percolation
threshold. The magnetic moment of this film is a sum of two contributions: from
nanogranules with biaxial anisotropy and a phase forming the percolation
cluster. The magnetic properties of nanogranules, whose contribution is
separated from the total film magnetization, agree well with the calculation
data.

symmetries that generate infinitely many local conservation laws that do not
commute with one another. The system is expected to (locally) relax to a
thermal ensemble if integrability is broken, or to a so-called generalised
Gibbs ensemble if unbroken. In some circumstances expectation values exhibit
quasi-stationary behaviour long before their typical relaxation time. For
integrability-breaking perturbations, these are also called pre-thermalisation
plateaux, and emerge e.g. in the strong coupling limit of the Bose-Hubbard
model. As a result of the hidden symmetries, quasi-stationarity appears also in
integrable models, for example in the Ising limit of the XXZ model. We
investigate a weak coupling limit, identify a time window in which the effects
of the perturbations become significant and solve the time evolution through a
mean-field mapping. As an explicit example we study the XYZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
chain with additional perturbations that break integrability. One of the most
intriguing results of the analysis is the appearance of persistent oscillatory
behaviour. To unravel its origin, we study in detail a toy model: the
transverse-field Ising chain with an additional nonlocal interaction
proportional to the square of the transverse spin per unit length [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 111, 197203 (2013)]. Despite being nonlocal, this belongs to a class of

ground-based astronomical observations. The resulting absorption line strength
and shape depend on the highly variable physical state of the atmosphere, i.e.
pressure, temperature, and mixing ratio of the different molecules involved.
Usually, supplementary observations of so-called telluric standard stars (TSS)
are needed to correct for this effect, which is expensive in terms of telescope
time. We have developed the software package molecfit to provide synthetic
transmission spectra based on parameters obtained by fitting narrow ranges of
the observed spectra of scientific objects. These spectra are calculated by
means of the radiative transfer code LBLRTM and an atmospheric model. In this
way, the telluric absorption correction for suitable objects can be performed
without any additional calibration observations of TSS. Aims: We evaluate the
quality of the telluric absorption correction using molecfit with a set of
archival ESO-VLT X-Shooter visible and near-infrared spectra. Methods: Thanks
to the wavelength coverage from the U to the K band, X-Shooter is well suited
to investigate the quality of the telluric absorption correction with respect
to the observing conditions, the instrumental set-up, input parameters of the
code, the signal-to-noise of the input spectrum, and the atmospheric profiles.
These investigations are based on two figures of merit, I_off and I_res, that
describe the systematic offsets and the remaining small-scale residuals of the
corrections. We also compare the quality of the telluric absorption correction
achieved with moelcfit to the classical method based on a telluric standard
star. (Abridged)

systems that are ""active"" and ""self-driven"". Here our range spans from
idealized self-propelled point particles, via sterically interacting particles
like granular hoppers, via microswimmers such as self-phoretically driven
artificial Janus particles or biological microorganisms, via deformable
self-propelled particles like droplets, up to the collective behavior of
insects, fish, and birds. As we emphasize, similarities emerge in the features
and behavior of systems that at first glance may not necessarily appear
related. We thus hope that our overview will further stimulate the search for
basic unifying principles underlying the physics of these soft materials out of
their equilibrium ground state.

analyzed, using deep observations with the Chandra observatory. The amplitude
of gas density fluctuations on different scales is measured in a set of radial
annuli. It varies from 8 to 12 per cent on scales of ~10-30 kpc within radii of
30-160 kpc from the cluster center and from 9 to 7 per cent on scales of ~20-30
kpc in an outer, 60-220 kpc annulus. Using a statistical linear relation
between the observed amplitude of density fluctuations and predicted velocity,
the characteristic velocity of gas motions on each scale is calculated. The
typical amplitudes of the velocity outside the central 30 kpc region are 90-140
km/s on ~20-30 kpc scales and 70-100 km/s on smaller scales ~7-10 kpc. The
velocity power spectrum is consistent with cascade of turbulence and its slope
is in a broad agreement with the slope for canonical Kolmogorov turbulence. The
gas clumping factor estimated from the power spectrum of the density
fluctuations is lower than 7-8 per cent for radii ~30-220 kpc from the center,
leading to a density bias of less than 3-4 per cent in the cluster core.
Uncertainties of the analysis are examined and discussed. Future measurements
of the gas velocities with the Astro-H, Athena and Smart-X observatories will
directly measure the gas density-velocity perturbation relation and further
reduce systematic uncertainties in these quantities.

this type can explain the gamma ray excess originating in the Galactic Center

branching ratio into WIMPs is suppressed, making these states challenging to
detect at colliders through standard dark matter searches. Here, we study the
prospects for observing these light mediator states at the LHC without
exploiting missing energy techniques. While existing searches effectively probe
pseudoscalars with masses between 5 - 14 GeV and above 90 GeV, the LHC reach
can be extended to cover much of the interesting parameter space in the
intermediate 20 - 80 GeV mass range in which the mediator can have appreciable
Yukawa-like couplings to Standard Model fermions but would have escaped
detection by LEP and other experiments. Models explaining the Galactic Center
excess via a light pseudoscalar mediator can give rise to a promising signal in
this regime through the associated production of the mediator with bottom
quarks while satisfying all other existing constraints. We perform an analysis
of the backgrounds and trigger efficiencies, detailing the cuts that can be
used to extract the signal. A significant portion of the otherwise
unconstrained parameter space of these models can be conclusively tested at the
13 TeV LHC with 100 fb$^{-1}$, and we encourage the ATLAS and CMS

circumbinary disc that rotates in a retrograde sense with respect to the
binary. In the circular binary case, no Lindblad resonances lie within the disc
and no Lindblad resonant torques are produced, as was previously known. By
analytic means, we show that when the binary orbit is eccentric, there exist
components of the gravitational potential of the binary which rotate in a
retrograde sense to the binary orbit and so rotate progradely with respect to
this disc, allowing a resonant interaction to occur between the binary and the
disc. The resulting resonant torques distinctly alter the disc response from
the circular binary case. We describe results of three-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations to explore this effect and categorise the response of the disc in
terms of modes whose strengths vary as a function of binary mass ratio and
eccentricity. These mode strengths are weak compared to the largest mode
strengths expected in the prograde case where the binary and disc rotate in the
same sense. However, for sufficiently high binary eccentricity, resonant
torques open a gap in a retrograde circumbinary disc, while permitting gas
inflow on to the binary via gas streams. The inflow results in a time varying
accretion rate on to the binary that is modulated over the binary orbital
period, as was previously found to occur in the prograde case.

with a larger $\mathrm{SU(2)}$ broken symmetry obtainable from the

transitions, the system exhibits thermally driven phase transitions between

where the condensate exhibits $\mathrm{SU(2)}$-symmetry, and where vortices are
not topological. At finite temperature, the system exhibits effects which do
not have a counter-part in single component systems. Namely, it has a state
where thermally averaged quantities show no regular vortex lattice, yet the

direct implications for the star formation process. In particular, gas may be
compressed and shocked at the inflow points, resulting in bursts of star
formation at these locations. Afterwards the gas and young stars move together
through the ring. In addition, star formation may occur throughout the ring, if
and when the gas reaches sufficient density to collapse under gravity. These
two scenarios for star formation in rings are often referred to as the `pearls
on a string' and `popcorn' paradigms. In this paper, we use new Herschel PACS
observations, obtained as part of the KINGFISH Open Time Key Program, along
with archival Spitzer and ground-based observations from the SINGS Legacy
project, to investigate the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium in
the nearby star-forming ring galaxy, NGC4736. By comparing spatially resolved
estimates of the stellar FUV flux available for heating, with the gas and dust
cooling derived from the FIR continuum and line emission, we show that while
star formation is indeed dominant at the inflow points in NGC 4736, additional
star formation is needed to balance the gas heating and cooling throughout the
ring. This additional component most likely arises from the general increase in
gas density in the ring over its lifetime. Our data provide strong evidence,
therefore, for a combination of the two paradigms for star formation in the
ring in NGC4736.

and unanswered questions on the origin of the positrons. In principle it should
be possible to form analogous systems from mu and tau leptons, viz. true
muonium and true tauonium. However the probability of formation for these
systems is greatly reduced due to the intrinsically short lifetimes of the mu
and tau leptons. Likewise, the decay of the atoms is hastened by the high
probability of the constituent particles decaying. Nevertheless, if sufficient
numbers of mu and tau pairs are produced in high energy astrophysical
environments there may be significant production of true muonium and true
tauonium, despite the small probabilities. This paper addresses this
possibility.
  We have calculated the pair production spectra of mu and tau leptons from
photon-photon annihilation and electron-positron annihilation in astrophysical
environments. We have computed the cross-sections for radiative recombination
and direct annihilation of the pairs, and the decay constants for the various
allowable decays, and the wavelengths and energies of the recombination and
annihilation signatures. In this way we have calculated the probabilities for
the formation of true muonium and true tauonium, and the branching ratios for
the various observable signatures.

strength that is different for each transition. Observationally, the effect of
resonant filling depends on both the outflow geometry and the size of the
outflow relative to the spectroscopic aperture. Neglecting these effects will
lead to incorrect values of gas covering fraction and column density. When a
fluorescent channel is available, the resonant profiles alone cannot be used to
infer the presence of scattered re-emission. Conversely, the presence of
emission lines of fluorescent transitions reveals that emission filling cannot
be neglected.

the edge theories on an unoriented spacetime, such as the Klein bottle. A key
technical step taken in this paper is the use of the so-called cross-cap
states, which encode entirely the unoriented nature of spacetime, and can be
obtained by rearranging the spacetime geometry and exchanging the role of space

that the corresponding cross-cap state is non-invariant under the action of the
symmetries of the SPT phase, but acquires an anomalous phase. This anomalous
phase, with a proper definition of a reference state, on which symmetry acts
trivially, reproduces the known classification of (2+1)-dimensional bosonic and
fermionic SPT phases protected by reflection symmetry, including in particular
the Z_8 classification of topological crystalline superconductors protected by

look for possible sequences of epochs describing a Universe starting with some

consistent with the rest of the sample, in agreement with previous results that
some dTrans galaxies may simply be low-luminosity dIrrs. We do not find a
correlation between the recent star-formation activity and the distance to the
nearest neighboring galaxy, suggesting that the star-formation process is not
driven by gravitational interactions, but regulated internally. Further, we
find a broadening in the star-formation and gas properties (i.e., specific
SFRs, stellar masses, and gas fractions) compared to the generally tight
correlation found in more massive galaxies. Overall, the star-formation and gas
properties indicate these very low-mass galaxies host a fluctuating,

acceleration schemes, this paper develops an online and modular learning
algorithm for a large class of non-convex data models, where convexity is
manifested only per-block of variables whenever the rest of them are held
fixed. The advocated algorithm incurs computational complexity that scales
linearly with the number of unknowns. Under minimal assumptions on the cost
functions of the composite optimization task, without bounding constraints on
the optimization variables, or any explicit information on bounds of Lipschitz
coefficients, the expected cost evaluated online at the resultant iterates is
provably convergent with quadratic rate to an accumulation point of the
(per-block) minima, while subgradients of the expected cost asymptotically
vanish in the mean-squared sense. The merits of the general approach are
demonstrated in two online learning setups: (i) Robust linear regression using
a sparsity-cognizant total least-squares criterion; and (ii) semi-supervised
dictionary learning for network-wide link load tracking and imputation with
missing entries. Numerical tests on synthetic and real data highlight the
potential of the proposed framework for streaming data analytics by
demonstrating superior performance over block coordinate descent, and reduced

subfactors. The first subfactor above index 4, the Haagerup subfactor, is
increasingly well understood and appears to lie in a (discrete) infinite family
of subfactors where the Z/3Z symmetry is replaced by other finite Abelian
groups. The goal of this paper is to give a similarly good description of the
Asaeda-Haagerup subfactor which emerged from our study of its Brauer-Picard
groupoid. More specifically, we construct a new subfactor S which is a Z/4Z x
Z/2Z analogue of the Haagerup subfactor and we show that the even parts of the
Asaeda-Haagerup subfactor are higher Morita equivalent to an orbifold quotient
of S. This gives a new construction of the Asaeda-Haagerup subfactor which is
much more symmetric and easier to work with than the original construction. As
a consequence, we can settle many open questions about the Asaeda-Haagerup
subfactor: calculating its Drinfel'd center, classifying all extensions of the
Asaeda-Haagerup fusion categories, finding the full higher Morita equivalence
class of the Asaeda-Haagerup fusion categories, and finding intermediate
subfactor lattices for subfactors coming from the Asaeda-Haagerup categories.
The details of the applications will be given in subsequent papers.

difficult to handle smart grids with data characterized by 4Vs data. This
paper, using random matrix theory (RMT), motivates data-driven tools to
perceive the complex grids in highdimension; meanwhile, an architecture with
detailed procedures is proposed. In algorithm perspective, the architecture
performs a high-dimensional analysis, and compares the findings with RMT
predictions to conduct anomaly detections. Mean Spectral Radius (MSR), as a
statistical indicator, is defined to reflect the correlations of system data in
different dimensions. In management mode perspective, a group-work mode is
discussed for smart grids operation. This mode breaks through regional
limitations for energy flows and data flows, and makes advanced big data
analyses possible. For a specific large-scale zone-dividing system with
multiple connected utilities, each site, operating under the group-work mode,
is able to work out the regional MSR only with its own measured/simulated data.
The large-scale interconnected system, in this way, is naturally decoupled from
statistical parameters perspective, rather than from engineering models
perspective. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of these distributed MSRs,
even with imperceptible different raw data, will produce a contour line to
detect the event and locate the source. It demonstrates that the architecture
is compatible with the block calculation only using the regional small
database; beyond that, this architecture, as a data-driven solution, is
sensitive to system situation awareness, and practical for real large-scale
interconnected systems. Five case studies and their visualizations validate the
designed architecture in various fields of power systems. To our best
knowledge, this study is the first attempt to apply big data technology into
smart grids.

rotating Kerr black hole in an attempt to spin it up beyond its extremal limit,
challenging weak cosmic censorship. We work in black-hole perturbation theory,
and focus on non-spinning, uncharged particles sent in on equatorial orbits. We
first identify the complete parameter-space region in which overspinning occurs
when back-reaction effects from the particle's self-gravity are ignored. We
find, in particular, that overspinning can be achieved only with particles sent
in from infinity. Gravitational self-force effects may prevent overspinning by
radiating away a sufficient amount of the particle's angular momentum
(""dissipative effect""), and/or by increasing the effective centrifugal
repulsion, so that particles with suitable parameters never get captured
(""conservative effect""). We analyze the full effect of the self-force, thereby
completing previous studies by Jacobson and Sotiriou (who neglected the
self-force) and by Barausse, Cardoso and Khanna (who considered the dissipative
effect on a subset of orbits). Our main result is an inequality, involving
certain self-force quantities, which describes a necessary and sufficient
condition for the overspinning scenario to be overruled. This ""censorship""
condition is formulated on a certain one-parameter family of geodesics in an
extremal Kerr geometry. We find that the censorship condition is insensitive to
the dissipative effect (within the first-order self-force approximation used
here), except for a subset of perfectly fine-tuned orbits, for which a separate
censorship condition is derived. We do not obtain here the self-force input
needed to evaluate either of our two conditions, but discuss the prospects for
producing the necessary data using state-of-the-art numerical codes.

describing the collective behaviour of the multi-polar configurations of
dislocations, which are widely observed in crystalline materials. The reason is
that dislocation dipoles, which play an important role in determining the
mechanical properties of crystals, often get smeared out when traditional
homogenisation methods are applied. To address such difficulties, the
collective behaviour of a row of dislocation dipoles is studied by using
matched asymptotic techniques. The discrete-to-continuum transition is
facilitated by introducing two field variables respectively describing the
dislocation pair density potential and the dislocation pair width. It is found
that the dislocation pair width evolves much faster than the pair density. Such
hierarchy in evolution time scales enables us to describe the dislocation
dynamics at the coarse-grained level by an evolution equation for the slowly
varying variable (the pair density) coupled with an equilibrium equation for
the fast varying variable (the pair width). The time-scale separation method
adopted here paves a way for properly incorporating dipole-like (zero net
Burgers vector but non-vanishing) dislocation structures, known as the
statistically stored dislocations (SSDs) into macroscopic models of crystal
plasticity in three dimensions. Moreover, the natural transition between
different equilibrium patterns found here may also shed light on understanding
the emergence of the persistent slip bands (PSBs) in fatigue metals induced by
cyclic loads.

the superconducting properties of iron-based superconductors through the

chemical composition due to S doping, we investigate the superconducting
properties of high-quality single crystals of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ ($x$=0, 0.04,
0.09, and 0.11) using magnetization, resistivity, the London penetration depth,
and low temperature specific heat measurements. We show that the introduction
of S to FeSe enhances the superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}$,
anisotropy, upper critical field $H_{c2}$, and critical current density
$J_{c}$. The upper critical field $H_{c2}(T)$ and its anisotropy are strongly
temperature dependent, indicating a multiband superconductivity in this system.
Through the measurements and analysis of the London penetration depth $\lambda
_{ab}(T)$ and specific heat, we show clear evidence for strong coupling two-gap
$s$-wave superconductivity. The temperature-dependence of $\lambda _{ab}(T)$
calculated from the lower critical field and electronic specific heat can be
well described by using a two-band model with $s$-wave-like gaps. We find that
a $d$-wave and single-gap BCS theory under the weak-coupling approach can not
describe our experiments. The change of specific heat induced by the magnetic
field can be understood only in terms of multiband superconductivity.

observation of states, here, each agent determines its next update time based
on its coupling structure. Both centralized and distributed approaches of the
algorithms have been discussed. By transforming the algorithm to a proper
discrete-time systems without self delays, we established a new analysis
framework to prove the convergence of the algorithm. Then we extended the
algorithm to networks with switching topologies, especially stochastically
switching topologies. Compared to existing works, our algorithm is easier to
understand and implement. It explicitly provides positive lower and upper
bounds for the update time interval of each agent based on its coupling

its own situation. Our work reveals that the event/self triggered algorithms
are essentially discrete and more suitable to a discrete analysis framework.

$\omega=m\Omega_H$, where $m$ is the azimuthal index and $\Omega_H$ is the

and occlusion for car detection and viewpoint estimation. The learned And-Or
model represents car-to-car context and occlusion configurations at three
levels: (i) spatially-aligned cars, (ii) single car under different occlusion
configurations, and (iii) a small number of parts. The And-Or model embeds a
grammar for representing large structural and appearance variations in a
reconfigurable hierarchy. The learning process consists of two stages in a
weakly supervised way (i.e., only bounding boxes of single cars are annotated).
Firstly, the structure of the And-Or model is learned with three components:
(a) mining multi-car contextual patterns based on layouts of annotated single
car bounding boxes, (b) mining occlusion configurations between single cars,
and (c) learning different combinations of part visibility based on car 3D CAD
simulation. The And-Or model is organized in a directed and acyclic graph which
can be inferred by Dynamic Programming. Secondly, the model parameters (for
appearance, deformation and bias) are jointly trained using Weak-Label
Structural SVM. In experiments, we test our model on four car detection
datasets --- the KITTI dataset \cite{Geiger12}, the PASCAL VOC2007 car
dataset~\cite{pascal}, and two self-collected car datasets, namely the
Street-Parking car dataset and the Parking-Lot car dataset, and three datasets

deformable part-based models and other methods, our model achieves significant
improvement consistently on the four detection datasets, and comparable

detected from 3C 279 by Fermi Large Area Telescope. Hour scale $\gamma$-ray

curved at peak of the flare suggesting low probability of detecting very high
energy (VHE; E $>$ 100 GeV) emission, which is further confirmed by the Very
Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System observations. The
$\gamma$-ray flux increased by more than an order in comparison to low activity
state and the flare consists of multiple sub-structures having fast rise and
slow decay profile. The flux enhancement is seen in all the wavebands though at
a lesser extent compared to $\gamma$-rays. During the flare, a considerable
amount of the kinetic jet power gets converted to $\gamma$-rays and the jet
becomes radiatively efficient. A one zone leptonic emission model is used to
reproduce the flare and we find increase in the bulk Lorentz factor as a major

reveal a complex network of emission features, the morphology of which ranges
from small, compact regions to extended, filamentary structures that are seen
in both emission and absorption. The dust column density is well traced by
molecules with higher excitation energies and critical densities, consistent
with a clump that has a denser interior. A statistical analysis supports the
idea that turbulence shapes the observed gas structure within G0.253+0.016. We
find a clear break in the turbulent power spectrum derived from the optically
thin dust continuum emission at a spatial scale of ~0.1 pc, which may
correspond to the spatial scale at which gravity has overcome the thermal
pressure. We suggest that G0.253+0.016 is on the verge of forming a cluster
from hierarchical, filamentary structures that arise from a highly turbulent
medium. Although the stellar distribution within Arches-like clusters is
compact, centrally condensed and smooth, the observed gas distribution within
G0.253+0.016 is extended, with no high-mass central concentration, and has a
complex, hierarchical structure. If this clump gives rise to a high-mass
cluster and its stars are formed from this initially hierarchical gas
structure, then the resulting cluster must evolve into a centrally condensed
structure via a dynamical process.

coordination in a local setting. We study the existence of equilibria that are
resilient to coalitional deviations of unbounded and bounded size (i.e., strong
equilibria and k-equilibria respectively). We show that pure Nash equilibria
and 2-equilibria exist, and give an example in which no 3-equilibrium exists.
Moreover, we prove that strong equilibria exist for various special cases.
  We also study the price of anarchy (PoA) and price of stability (PoS) for
these solution concepts. We show that the PoS for strong equilibria is 1 in
almost all of the special cases for which we have proven strong equilibria to
exist. The PoA for pure Nash equilbria turns out to be unbounded, even when we
fix the graph on which the coordination game is to be played. For the PoA for
k-equilibria, we show that the price of anarchy is between 2(n-1)/(k-1) - 1 and
2(n-1)/(k-1). The latter upper bound is tight for $k=n$ (i.e., strong
equilibria).
  Finally, we consider the problems of computing strong equilibria and of
determining whether a joint strategy is a k-equilibrium or strong equilibrium.
We prove that, given a coordination game, a joint strategy s, and a number k as
input, it is co-NP complete to determine whether s is a k-equilibrium. On the
positive side, we give polynomial time algorithms to compute strong equilibria

used to initiate the folding process of individual proteins. The folding
process is initiated by quickly diluting a local denaturant concentration, and
we define mixing time as the time advecting proteins experience a specified to
achieve a local drop in denaturant concentration. In previous work, we
presented a minimization of mixing time which considered optimal geometry and
flow conditions, and achieved a design with a predicted mixing time of 0.10
$\mu$s. The aim of the current paper is twofold. First, we explore the
sensitivity of mixing time to key geometric and flow parameters. In particular,
we study the angle between inlets, the shape of the channel intersections,
channel widths, mixer depth, mixer symmetry, inlet velocities, working fluid
physical properties, and denaturant concentration thresholds. Second, we
analyze the uniformity of mixing times as a function of inlet flow streamlines.
We find the shape of the intersection, channel width, inlet velocity ratio, and
asymmetries have strong effects on mixing time; while inlet angles, mixer
depth, fluid properties, and concentration thresholds have weaker effects.
Also, the uniformity of the mixing time is preserved for most of the inlet flow
and distances of down to within about 0.4 $\mu$m of the mixer wall. We offer
these analyses of sensitivities to imperfections in mixer geometry and flow
conditions as a guide to experimental efforts which aim to fabricate and use
these types of mixers. Our study also highlights key issues and provides a
guide to the optimization and practical design of other microfluidic devices

introduce superconductivity successfully. Superconductivity sharply appears at
a pressure of 2.5 GPa, rapidly reaching a maximum critical temperature (Tc) of
7 K at around 16.8 GPa, followed by a monotonic decrease in Tc with increasing
pressure, thereby exhibiting the typical dome-shaped superconducting phase.
From theoretical calculations, we interpret the low-pressure region of the
superconducting dome to an enrichment of the density of states at the Fermi

instability. Thus, Tungsten ditelluride may provide a new platform for our

ionization potential (FIP) bias. Using spectra obtained by Hinode's EUV Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) instrument, we present a series of large-scale, spatially
resolved composition maps of active region (AR) 11389. The composition maps
show how FIP bias evolves within the decaying AR from 2012 January 4-6.
Globally, FIP bias decreases throughout the AR. We analyzed areas of
significant plasma composition changes within the decaying AR and found that
small-scale evolution in the photospheric magnetic field is closely linked to
the FIP bias evolution observed in the corona. During the AR's decay phase,
small bipoles emerging within supergranular cells reconnect with the
pre-existing AR field, creating a pathway along which photospheric and coronal
plasmas can mix. The mixing time scales are shorter than those of plasma
enrichment processes. Eruptive activity also results in shifting the FIP bias
closer to photospheric in the affected areas. Finally, the FIP bias still
remains dominantly coronal only in a part of the AR's high-flux density core.
We conclude that in the decay phase of an AR's lifetime, the FIP bias is
becoming increasingly modulated by episodes of small-scale flux emergence, i.e.
decreasing the AR's overall FIP bias. Our results show that magnetic field
evolution plays an important role in compositional changes during AR
development, revealing a more complex relationship than expected from previous
well-known Skylab results showing that FIP bias increases almost linearly with
age in young ARs (Widing $\&$ Feldman, 2001, ApJ, 555, 426).

low-mass star in orbit around a giant star. Spectral classification helps to
identify the giant stars and also early-type stars which are often excluded
from further follow-up.
  We study the potential and the limitations of low-resolution spectroscopy to
improve the photometric spectral types of CoRoT candidates. In particular, we
want to study the influence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the target
spectrum in a quantitative way. We built an own template library and
investigate whether a template library from the literature is able to reproduce
the classifications. Including previous photometric estimates, we show how the
additional spectroscopic information improves the constraints on spectral type.
  Low-resolution spectroscopy ($R\approx$1000) of 42 CoRoT targets covering a
wide range in SNR (1-437) and of 149 templates was obtained in 2012-2013 with
the Nasmyth spectrograph at the Tautenburg 2m telescope. Spectral types have
been derived automatically by comparing with the observed template spectra. The
classification has been repeated with the external CFLIB library.
  The spectral class obtained with the external library agrees within a few
sub-classes when the target spectrum has a SNR of about 100 at least. While the
photometric spectral type can deviate by an entire spectral class, the
photometric luminosity classification is as close as a spectroscopic
classification with the external library. A low SNR of the target spectrum
limits the attainable accuracy of classification more strongly than the use of
external templates or photometry. Furthermore we found that low-resolution
reconnaissance spectroscopy ensures that good planet candidates are kept that
would otherwise be discarded based on photometric spectral type alone.

radio data obtained with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40-m telescope, 95
GHz millimeter data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave
Astronomy, and GeV gamma-ray data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The
radio light curves during the flaring periods in 2012 and 2013 have very
different appearances, both in shape and peak flux density. Assuming that the
radio and gamma-ray flares are physically connected, we attempt to model the
most prominent sub-flares of the 2012 and 2013 activity periods by using the
simplest possible theoretical framework. We first fit a one-zone synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) model to the less extreme 2013 flare and estimate parameters
describing the emission region. We then model the major gamma-ray and radio
flares of 2012 using the same framework. The 2012 gamma-ray flare shows two
distinct spikes of similar amplitude, so we examine scenarios associating the
radio flare with each spike in turn. In the first scenario, we cannot explain
the sharp radio flare with a simple SSC model, but we can accommodate this by
adding plausible time variations to the Doppler beaming factor. In the second
scenario, a varying Doppler factor is not needed, but the SSC model parameters
require fine tuning. Both alternatives indicate that the sharp radio flare, if
physically connected to the preceding gamma-ray flares, can be reproduced only
for a very specific choice of parameters.

However, two different temperature behaviors of thermal conductivities have

thermal conductivities as the function of temperature. In this work, we will
revisit the temperature dependent thermal conductivities for the 1D coupled

universe was preceded by a primordial stage of strong anisotropy. In particular
we focus on the simplest model of this kind, where the spacetime is described
by a non-singular Kasner solution that quickly evolves into an isotropic de
Sitter space, the so-called Kasner-de Sitter solution. The initial Big Bang
singularity is replaced, in this case, by a horizon. We show that the extension
of this metric to the region behind the horizon contains a timelike singularity
which will be visible by cosmological observers. This makes it impossible to
have a reliable prediction of the quantum state of the cosmological
perturbations in the region of interest. In this paper we consider the
possibility that this Kasner-de Sitter universe is obtained as a result of a
quantum tunneling process effectively substituting the region behind the
horizon by an anisotropic parent vacuum state, namely a $1+1$ dimensional
spacetime compactified over an internal flat torus, $T_2$, which we take it to
be of the form ${de Sitter}_2 \times T_2$ or ${Minkowski}_2 \times T_2$. As a
first approximation to understand the effects of this anisotropic initial
state, we compute the power spectrum of a massless scalar field in these
backgrounds. In both cases, the spectrum converges at small scales to the
isotropic scale invariant form and only present important deviations from it at
the largest possible scales. We find that the decompactification scenario from
$M_2 \times T_2$ leads to a suppressed and slightly anisotropic power spectrum
at large scales which could be related to some of the anomalies present in the
current CMB data. On the other hand, the spectrum of the universe with a $dS_2
\times T_2$ parent vacuum presents an enhancement in power at large scales not
consistent with observations.

where a probabilistic model is defined and its marginal likelihoods are

advantages over traditional distance-based agglomerative clustering algorithms,
successive evaluation of marginal likelihoods and careful hyperparameter tuning
are cumbersome and limit the scalability. In this paper we relax BHC into a
non-probabilistic formulation, exploring small-variance asymptotics in
conjugate-exponential models. We develop a novel clustering algorithm, referred
to as relaxed BHC (RBHC), from the asymptotic limit of the BHC model that
exhibits the scalability of distance-based agglomerative clustering algorithms
as well as the flexibility of Bayesian nonparametric models. We also
investigate the reducibility of the dissimilarity measure emerged from the
asymptotic limit of the BHC model, allowing us to use scalable algorithms such
as the nearest neighbor chain algorithm. Numerical experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the validity and high performance
of our method.

unique, since it is the only stable solution which is a good starting point for
reproducing the observed pattern of quark masses and mixing. We also show that

generations are generated through the breaking of this discrete symmetry, and,
at this stage, scalar mediated FCNC arise, but are naturally suppressed by the

field of research. Formed by runaway collisions of massive stars in young and
dense stellar clusters, intermediate-mass black holes could still be present in
the centers of globular clusters, today. Our group investigated the presence of
intermediate-mass black holes for a sample of 10 Galactic globular clusters. We
measured the inner kinematic profiles with integral-field spectroscopy and
determined masses or upper limits of central black holes in each cluster. In
combination with literature data we further studied the positions of our
results on known black-hole scaling relations (such as M_bh - sigma) and found
a similar but flatter correlation for IMBHs. Applying cluster evolution codes,
the change in the slope could be explained with the stellar mass loss occurring
in clusters in a tidal field over its life time. Furthermore, we present
results from several numerical simulations on the topic of IMBHs and integral
field units (IFUs). We ran N-body simulations of globular clusters containing
IMBHs in a tidal field and studied their effects on mass-loss rates and remnant
fractions and showed that an IMBH in the center prevents core collapse and
ejects massive objects more rapidly. These simulations were further used to
simulate IFU data cubes. For the specific case of NGC 6388 we simulated two
different IFU techniques and found that velocity dispersion measurements from
individual velocities are strongly biased towards lower values due to blends of
neighbouring stars and background light. In addition, we use the Astrophysical
Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE) to combine gravitational physics,
stellar evolution and hydrodynamics to simulate the accretion of stellar winds

models of neuronal network dynamics, which incorporates stochastic delay caused
by the existence of a refractory period of neurons. From the point of view of
the dynamics of the individual elements, we are dealing with a network of
non-Markovian stochastic two-state oscillators with memory which are coupled
globally in a mean-field fashion. This interrelation of a higher-dimensional
Markovian and lower-dimensional non-Markovian dynamics is discussed in its
relevance to the general problem of the network dynamics of complex elements
possessing memory. The simplest model of this class is provided by a
three-state Markovian neuron with one refractory state, which causes firing
delay with an exponentially decaying memory within the two-state reduced model.
This basic model is used to study critical avalanche dynamics (the noise
sustained criticality) in a balanced feedforward network consisting of the
excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Such avalanches emerge due to the network
size dependent noise (mesoscopic noise). Numerical simulations reveal an
intermediate power law in the distribution of avalanche sizes with the critical
exponent around -1.16. We show that this power law is robust upon a variation
of the refractory time over several orders of magnitude. However, the avalanche
time distribution is biexponential. It does not reflect any genuine power law

These

critical point moves to significantly lower density, and the coexisting phases
change their structure. In particular, the liquid phase is ""porous"", exhibiting
large percolating voids. The properties of this system depend strongly on the

Shorter version submitted to IEEE AES",,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work the detection of moving targets in multiantenna SAR is
considered. As a high resolution radar imaging modality, SAR detects and
identifies stationary targets very well, giving it an advantage over classical
GMTI radars. Moving target detection is more challenging due to the ""burying""
of moving targets in the clutter and is often achieved using space-time
adaptive processing (STAP) (based on learning filters from the spatio-temporal
clutter covariance) to remove the stationary clutter and enhance the moving
targets. In this work, it is noted that in addition to the oft noted low rank
structure, the clutter covariance is also naturally in the form of a space vs
time Kronecker product with low rank factors. A low-rank KronPCA covariance
estimation algorithm is proposed to exploit this structure, and a separable
clutter cancelation filter based on the Kronecker covariance estimate is
proposed. Together, these provide orders of magnitude reduction in the number
of training samples required, as well as improved robustness to corruption of
the training data, e.g. due to outliers and moving targets. Theoretical
properties of the proposed estimation algorithm are derived and the significant
reductions in training complexity are established under the spherically
invariant random vector model (SIRV). Finally, an extension of this approach
incorporating multipass data (change detection) is presented. Simulation
results and experiments using the real Gotcha SAR GMTI challenge dataset are

appealing saliency maps on the background images, which contain no salient

classification term conditioned to the salient object existence variable, which
in turn depends on both global image and regional saliency features and

radial velocity variations has been obtained for the magnetic standard star HD
94660 based on high-dispersion spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric
observations from the UVES, HARPSpol and ESPaDOnS instruments.
  We perform a detailed chemical abundance analysis using the spectrum
synthesis code zeeman for a total of 17 elements. Using both line-of-sight and
surface magnetic field measurements, we derive a simple magnetic field model
that consists of dipole, quadrupole and octupole components.
  The observed magnetic field variations of HD 94660 are complex and suggest an
inhomogeneous distribution of chemical elements over the stellar surface. This
inhomogeneity is not reflected in the abundance analysis, from which all
available spectra are modelled, but only a mean abundance is reported for each
element. The derived abundances are mostly non-solar, with striking
overabundances of Fe-peak and rare-earth elements. Of note are the clear
signatures of vertical chemical stratification throughout the stellar
atmosphere, most notably for the Fe-peak elements. We also report on the
detection of radial velocity variations with a total range of 35 km/s in the
spectra of HD 94660. A preliminary analysis shows the most likely period of
these variations to be of order 840 d and, based on the derived orbital
parameters of this star, suggests the first detection of a massive compact
companion for a main sequence magnetic star.
  HD 94660 exhibits interestingly complex magnetic field variations and
remarkable radial velocity variations. Long term monitoring is necessary to
provide further constraints on the nature of these radial velocity variations.
Detection of a companion will help establish the role of binarity in the origin
of magnetism in stars with radiative envelopes.

electromagnetic/thermal modeling of the device structure and with large area
spin Seebeck measurements.

with the aid of computer tomography methods. Computer tomography allows the
reconstruction of slices of an investigated sample using a set of shadow
projections obtained for different angles. Projections in the MARS scanner are
produced using a cone x-ray beam geometry. Correct reconstruction in this
scheme requires precise knowledge of several geometrical parameters of a
tomograph, such as displacement of a rotation axis, x-ray source position with
respect to a camera, and camera inclinations. Use of inaccurate parameters
leads to a poor sample reconstruction. Non-ideal positioning of camera, x-ray
source and cylindrical rotating frame (gantry) itself on which these parts are
located, leads to the need for tomograph alignment. In this note we describe
the alignment procedure that was used to get different geometrical corrections
for the reconstruction. Also, several different estimations of the final
spatial resolution for reconstructed images are presented.

dots is in demand to implement solid-state quantum information processing and
spintronics. Normally, particle wave functions can be tuned transversely by an
perpendicular magnetic field. We report a longitudinal wave function control in
single quantum dots with a magnetic field. For a pure InAs quantum dot with a
shape of pyramid or truncated pyramid, the hole wave function always occupies
the base because of the less confinement at base, which induces a permanent
dipole oriented from base to apex. With applying magnetic field along the
base-apex direction, the hole wave function shrinks in the base plane. Because
of the linear changing of the confinement for hole wave function from base to
apex, the center of effective mass moves up during shrinking process. Due to
the uniform confine potential for electrons, the center of effective mass of
electrons does not move much, which results in a permanent dipole moment change
and an inverted electron-hole alignment along the magnetic field direction.
Manipulating the wave function longitudinally not only provides an alternative
way to control the charge distribution with magnetic field but also a new
method to tune electron-hole interaction in single quantum dots.

structure between two time series. Our methods rely exclusively on the order
structure of the data points. Hence, the methods are stable under monotone
transformations of the time series and robust against small perturbations or
measurement errors. Ordinal pattern dependence can be characterized by four
parameters. We propose estimators for these parameters, and we calculate their
asymptotic distributions. Furthermore, we derive a test for structural breaks
within the dependence structure. All results are supplemented by simulation
studies and empirical examples.
  For three consecutive data points attaining different values, there are six
possibilities how their values can be ordered. These possibilities are called
ordinal patterns. Our first idea is simply to count the number of coincidences
of patterns in both time series, and to compare this with the expected number
in the case of independence. If we detect a lot of coincident patterns, this
means that the up-and-down behavior is similar. Hence, our concept can be seen
as a way to measure non-linear `correlation'. We show in the last section, how
to generalize the concept in order to capture various other kinds of
dependence.

equation of state for uranium and plutonium, appropriate for conditions in
which these materials are subjected to strong shock compressions, as in
cylindrical and spherical implosions.
  The three-term equation of state takes into account the three components of
the pressure that resist to compression in the solid: the elastic or ""cold""
pressure (coulombian repulsion between atoms), the thermal pressure due to
vibratory motion of atoms in the lattice of the solid and the thermal pressure
of electrons thermally excited. The equation of state defined here permits also
to take into account the variation of the specific heat with the transition of
the solid to the liquid or gaseous state due to continued growth of temperature
in strong shock compressions.
  In the definition of uranium equation of state, experimental data on the
uranium compression, available in the open scientific literature, are used. In
the plutonium case, this element was considered initially in the alpha-phase or
stabilized in the delta-phase. In the last case, an abrupt and instantaneous
transition to the alpha-phase was considered when the delta-phase plutonium is
submitted to strong compressions.

implants. By employing double-loop negative feedback, the output impedance of
the current generator is increased, while maximizing the voltage compliance of
the output transistor. To make the stimulator circuit compact, the stimulation
current is set by scaling a reference current using a two stage binary-weighted
transistor DAC (comprising a 3 bit high-voltage transistor DAC and a 4 bit
low-voltage transistor DAC). With this structure the power consumption and the
area of the circuit can be minimized. The proposed circuit has been implemented
in AMS 0.18um high-voltage CMOS IC technology, using an active chip area of
about 0.042mm^2. Measurement results show that proper charge balance of the
anodic and cathodic stimulation phases is achieved and a dc blocking capacitor
can be omitted. The resulting reduction in the required area makes the proposed
system suitable for a large number of channels.
