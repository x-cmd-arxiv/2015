using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. We show that it is
possible to identify decoupled graphene monolayer, Bernal bilayer, and Bernal
trilayer on graphite surface according to their tunnelling spectra in high
magnetic field. The decoupled monolayer and bilayer exhibit Landau quantization
of massless and massive Dirac fermions, respectively. The substrate generates a
sizable band gap, ~35 meV, in the Bernal bilayer, therefore, the eightfold
degenerate Landau level at the charge neutrality point is split into two
valley-polarized quartets polarized on each layer. In the decoupled Bernal
trilayer, we find that both massless and massive Dirac fermions coexist and its
low-energy band structure can be described quite well by taking into account
only the nearest-neighbor intra- and interlayer hopping parameters. A strong
correlation between the Fermi velocity of the massless Dirac fermions and the
effective mass of the massive Dirac fermions is observed in the trilayer. Our
result demonstrates that the surface of graphite provides a natural ideal
platform to probe the electronic spectra of graphene layers.

unlikely to be valid for suspended mass optical cavities. We demonstrate that
mirror figure errors cause a dependence of transverse mode offset frequency on
spot position. Combined with low frequency residual motion of suspended
mirrors, this leads to transverse mode frequency modulation which suppresses
the effective parametric gain. We show that this gain suppression mechanism can
be enhanced by laser spot dithering or fast thermal modulation. Using Advanced

results to all non-trivial primitives. We provide a framework for quantifying

  Our near-infrared flux spectra are well reproduced by the PHOENIX model

the angular diameter and the fundamental parameters of our sources.

increasing luminosity and decreasing surface gravity, and no correlation with

interpreting the astrophysical significance of observational data, particularly

surveys such as 2dFGRS and SDSS, but their application to radio surveys of cold
gas in galaxies has been limited. In this chapter we describe recent
developments in the modelling of the cold gas properties in the models, and how
these developments are essential if they are to be applied to cold gas surveys
of the kind that will be carried out with the SKA. By linking explicitly a
galaxy's star formation rate to the abundance of molecular hydrogen in the
galaxy rather than cold gas abundance, as was assumed previously, the latest
models reproduce naturally many of the global atomic and molecular hydrogen
properties of observed galaxies. We review some of the key results of the
latest models and highlight areas where further developments are necessary. We
discuss also how model predictions can be most accurately compared with
observational data, what challenges we expect when creating synthetic galaxy
surveys in the SKA era, and how the SKA can be used to test models of dark
matter.

position of the quantum dots between frames in a movie of their motion.
Previously we have shown that the directions of the jumps are uniformly
distributed and the jump lengths can be characterized by a double power law
distribution.
  Here we show that the jumps over a small number of time steps can be
described by scalings of a {\em single} double power law distribution. This
provides additional strong evidence that the double power law provides an
accurate description of the fine scale motion. This more extensive analysis
provides strong evidence that the double power law is a novel stable
distribution for the motion. This analysis provides strong evidence that an
earlier result that the motion can be modeled as diffusion in a space of
fractional dimension roughly 3/2 is correct. The form of the power law
distribution quantifies the excess of short jumps in the data and provides an
accurate characterization of the fine scale diffusion and, in fact, this
distribution gives an accurate description of the jump lengths up to a few
hundred nanometers. Our results complement of the usual mean squared
displacement analysis used to study diffusion at larger scales where the
proteins are more likely to strongly interact with larger membrane structures.

attention as a possible path to the synthesis of new neutron-rich heavy nuclei.
  Purpose: We study transfer reactions involving massive nuclei with the
intention of understanding if the semi-classical model GRAZING coupled to an
evaporation and fission competition model can satisfactory reproduce
experimental data on transfer reactions in which fission plays a role.
  Methods: We have taken the computer code GRAZING and have added fission
competition to it (GRAZING-F) using our current understanding of
$\Gamma_n/\Gamma_f$, fission barriers and level densities.
  Results: The code GRAZING-F seems to satisfactory reproduce experimental data
for $+1p$, $+2p$ and $+3p$ transfers, but has limitations in reproducing
measurements of larger above-target and below-target transfers. Nonetheless, we
use GRAZING-F to estimate production rates of neutron-rich $N=126$ nuclei,
actinides and transactinides.
  Conclusions: The GRAZING code, with appropriate modifications to account for
fission decay as well as neutron emission by excited primary fragments, does
not predict large cross sections for multi-nucleon transfer reactions leading
to neutron-rich transactinide nuclei, but predicts opportunities to produce new
neutron-rich actinide isotopes.

The data reduction procedures almost always assume that ther esponse of a given

We show evidence that this simple picture is not exact for several CCD sensors.
Namely, we provide evidence that localized distributions of charges (resulting
from star illumination or laboratory luminous spots) tend to broaden linearly
with increasing brightness by up to a few percent over the whole dynamic range.
We propose a physical explanation for this ""brighter-fatter"" effect, which
implies that flatfields do not exactly follow Poisson statistics: the variance
of flatfields grows less rapidly than their average, and neighboring pixels
show covariances, which increase similarly to the square of the flatfield
average. These covariances decay rapidly with pixel separation. We observe the
expected departure from Poisson statistics of flatfields on CCD devices and
show that the observed effects are compatible with Coulomb forces induced by
stored charges that deflect forthcoming charges. We extract the strength of the
deflections from the correlations of flatfield images and derive the evolution
of star shapes with increasing flux. We show for three types of sensors that
within statistical uncertainties,our proposed method properly bridges
statistical properties of flatfields and the brighter-fatter effect.

dial-a-ride services with coordinated drivers significantly differ from
profit-motivated taxi services with uncoordinated drivers. As such, there are
two key threads of research for efficient scheduling, routing, and pricing for

detection is challenging because the region of interest is contaminated by the
hosts star companion as well as the host Generally, the light leakage is caused
by both diffraction and aberrations in the system. Moreover, the region of
interest usually falls outside the correcting zone of the deformable mirror
(DM) for the companion. Until now, it has been thought that removing the light
of a companion star is too challenging, leading to the exclusion of binary
systems from target lists of direct imaging coronographic missions. In this
paper, we will show different new techniques for high-contrast imaging of
planets around multi-star systems and detail the Super-Nyquist Wavefront
Control (SNWC) method, which allows to control wavefront errors beyond nominal
control region of the DM. Using the SNWC we reached contrasts around $ 5 \times
10 ^ { -9 } $ in a 10% bandwidth.

in bismuth, with a magnetic field perpendicular to the applied electric current
and rotating in three distinct crystallographic planes. The observed angular
oscillations are confronted with the expectations of semi-classic transport
theory for a multi-valley system with anisotropic mobility and the agreement
allows us to quantify the components of the mobility tensor for both electrons
and holes. A quadratic temperature dependence is resolved. As Hartman argued
long ago, this indicates that inelastic resistivity in bismuth is dominated by
carrier-carrier scattering. At low temperature and high magnetic field, the
threefold symmetry of the lattice is suddenly lost. Specifically, a $2\pi/3$
rotation of magnetic field around the trigonal axis modifies the amplitude of
the magneto-resistance below a field-dependent temperature. By following the
evolution of this anomaly as a function of temperature and magnetic field, we
mapped the boundary in the (field, temperature) plane separating two electronic
states. In the less-symmetric state, confined to low temperature and high
magnetic field, the three Dirac valleys cease to be rotationally invariant. We
discuss the possible origins of this spontaneous valley polarization, including
a valley-nematic scenario.

multiple transmissions before changing state. These are used to model behaviors
if an individual only adopts a particular behavior after perceiving a consensus
among others. We may think of individuals as beginning inactive and becoming
active after contact with a sufficient number of active partners. These have
been studied in a number of cases, but analytic models for the dynamic spread
of complex contagions are typically complex. Here we study the dynamics of the
Watts Threshold Model (WTM) assuming transmission occurs in continuous time as
a Poisson process, or in discrete time where individuals transmit to all
partners in the time step following their activation. We adapt techniques
developed for infectious disease modeling to develop and analyze analytic
models for the dynamics of the WTM in Configuration Model networks and a class
of random clustered (triangle-based) networks. The resulting model is
relatively simple and compact. We use it to gain insights into the contagion
dynamics. In the infinite population limit, we derive conditions under which
cascades happen with an arbitrarily small initial proportion active, confirming
a hypothesis of Watts for this case. We also observe hybrid phase transitions
when cascades are not possible for small initial conditions, but occur for
large enough initial conditions. We derive sufficient conditions for this
hybrid phase transition to occur. We show that in many cases, if the hybrid
phase transition occurs, all individuals eventually become active. Finally, we
discuss the role clustering plays in facilitating or impeding the spread and
find that the hypothesis of Watts that was confirmed in Configuration Model
networks does not hold in general. This approach allows us to unify many
existing disparate observations and derive new results.

pore has opposite polarity flux compared to the surrounding network field. This
leads to a spine-fan magnetic topology in the coronal field that is amenable to
jet formation. Time-dependent data-driven simulations are used to investigate
the underlying drivers for the jets. These numerical experiments show that the

problems has emerged in the form of the the algebraic dichotomy conjecture of
[BKJ00]. Roughly speaking, the characterization asserts that a CSP {\Lambda} is
tractable if and only if there exist certain non-trivial operations known as
polymorphisms to combine solutions to {\Lambda} to create new ones. In an
entirely separate line of work, the unique games conjecture yields a
characterization of approximability of Max-CSPs. Surprisingly, this
characterization for Max-CSPs can also be reformulated in the language of
polymorphisms.
  In this work, we study whether existence of non-trivial polymorphisms implies
tractability beyond the realm of constraint satisfaction problems, namely in
the value-oracle model. Specifically, given a function f in the value-oracle
model along with an appropriate operation that never increases the value of f ,
we design algorithms to minimize f . In particular, we design a randomized
algorithm to minimize a function f that admits a fractional polymorphism which
is measure preserving and has a transitive symmetry.
  We also reinterpret known results on MaxCSPs and thereby reformulate the
unique games conjecture as a characterization of approximability of max-CSPs in

statistical physics approach to the calculation of short-time transport
properties of colloidal suspensions. A revised version of the BM method with an
improved treatment of hydrodynamic interactions is presented and evaluated
regarding the rotational short-time self-diffusion coefficient, $D^r$ , of
suspensions of charged particles interacting by a hard-sphere plus screened
Coulomb (Yukawa) pair potential. To assess the accuracy of the method,
elaborate simulations of $D^r$ have been performed, covering a broad range of
interaction parameters and particle concentrations. The revised BM method is
compared in addition with results by a simplifying pairwise additivity (PA)
method in which the hydrodynamic interactions are treated on a two-body level.
The static pair correlation functions re- quired as input to both theoretical
methods are calculated using the Rogers-Young integral equation scheme. While
the revised BM method reproduces the general trends of the simulation results,
it systematically and significantly underestimates the rotational diffusion
coefficient. The PA method agrees well with the simulation data at lower volume
fractions, but at higher concentrations $D^r$ is likewise underestimated. For a
fixed value of the pair potential at mean particle distance comparable to the
thermal energy, $D^r$ increases strongly with increasing Yukawa potential
screening parameter.

interpretation for the positron excess observed in a variety of experiments,
HEAT, PAMELA, and AMS-02, is highly constrained by the Fermi/LAT observations
of dwarf galaxies. In particular, this paper has focused on the annihilation
channels that best fit the current AMS-02 data (Boudaud et al., 2014). The
Fermi satellite has surveyed the $\gamma$-ray sky, and its observations of
dwarf satellites are used to place strong bounds on the annihilation of WIMPs
into a variety of channels. For the single channel case, we find that dark
matter annihilation into {$b\bar{b}$, $e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$,
4-$e$, or 4-$\tau$} is ruled out as an explanation of the AMS positron excess
(here $b$ quarks are a proxy for all quarks, gauge and Higgs bosons). In
addition, we find that the Fermi/LAT 2$\sigma$ upper limits, assuming the
best-fit AMS-02 branching ratios, exclude multichannel combinations into
$b\bar{b}$ and leptons. The tension between the results might relax if the
branching ratios are allowed to deviate from their best-fit values, though a
substantial change would be required. Of all the channels we considered, the
only viable channel that survives the Fermi/LAT constraint and produces a good

clouds to derive the mass distribution of primordial stars. The star formation
in our cosmological simulations is characterized by two distinct populations,
the so-called Population III.1 stars and primordial stars formed under the
influence of far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation (Population III.2D stars). In this
work, we determine the stellar masses by using the dependences on the physical
properties of star-forming cloud and/or the external photodissociating
intensity from nearby primordial stars, which are derived from the results of
two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of protostellar feedback.
The characteristic mass of the Pop III stars is found to be a few hundred solar
masses at z ~ 25, and it gradually shifts to lower masses with decreasing
redshift. At high redshifts z > 20, about half of the star-forming gas clouds
are exposed to intense FUV radiation and thus give birth to massive Pop III.2D
stars. However, the local FUV radiation by nearby Pop III stars becomes weaker
at lower redshifts, when typical Pop III stars have smaller masses and the mean
physical separation between the stars becomes large owing to cosmic expansion.
Therefore, at z < 20, a large fraction of the primordial gas clouds host Pop
III.1 stars. At z =< 15, the Pop III.1 stars are formed in relatively cool gas
clouds due to efficient radiative cooling by H_2 and HD molecules; such stars
have masses of a few x 10 Msun. Since the stellar evolution and the final fate
are determined by the stellar mass, Pop III stars formed at different epochs
play different roles in the early universe.

mean-motion resonances with planets. Such resonantly trapped grains are
observed in the solar system. In extrasolar systems, the exozodiacal light
produced by dust grains is expected to be a major obstacle to future missions
attempting to directly image terrestrial planets. The patterns made by
resonantly trapped dust, however, can be used to infer the presence of planets,
and the properties of those planets, if the capture and evolution of the grains
can be modelled. This has been done with N-body methods, but such methods are
computationally expensive, limiting their usefulness when considering large,
slowly evolving grains, and for extrasolar systems with unknown planets and
parent bodies, where the possible parameter space for investigation is large.
In this work, we present a semi-analytic method for calculating the capture and
evolution of dust grains in resonance, which can be orders of magnitude faster
than N-body methods. We calibrate the model against N-body simulations, finding
excellent agreement for Earth to Neptune mass planets, for a variety of grain
sizes, initial eccentricities, and initial semimajor axes. We then apply the
model to observations of dust resonantly trapped by the Earth. We find that
resonantly trapped, asteroidally produced grains naturally produce the
`trailing blob' structure in the zodiacal cloud, while to match the intensity
of the blob, most of the cloud must be composed of cometary grains, which owing
to their high eccentricity are not captured, but produce a smooth disk.

combination of variations in halo concentration, ellipticity and orientation,
and the presence of correlated haloes. We calibrate the parameters of our model
at the 10 per cent level to match the empirical cosmic variance of cluster
profiles at M_200m=10^14...10^15 h^-1 M_sol, z=0.25...0.5 in a cosmological

underestimate mass uncertainties if intrinsic profile variations are ignored,
and that our model can be used to provide correct mass likelihoods. Effects on
the achievable accuracy of weak lensing cluster mass measurements are
particularly strong for the most massive clusters and deep observations (with
~20 per cent uncertainty from cosmic variance alone at M_200m=10^15 h^-1 M_sol

show that neglecting intrinsic profile variations leads to biases in the
mass-observable relation constrained with weak lensing, both for intrinsic

are in excess of the statistical errors of upcoming surveys and can be avoided

on measurements of the spatial monopole of the 21 cm brightness temperature as
a function of redshift (the ""global signal""). Most global experiments to date
have been single-element experiments. In this paper, we show how an
interferometer can be designed to be sensitive to the monopole mode of the sky,
thus providing an alternate approach to accessing the global signature. We
provide simple rules of thumb for designing a global signal interferometer and
use numerical simulations to show that a modest array of tightly packed antenna
elements with moderately sized primary beams (full-width-half-max of
$\sim$40$^\circ$) can compete with typical single-element experiments in their
ability to constrain phenomenological parameters pertaining to reionization and
the pre-reionization era. We also provide a general data analysis framework for
extracting the global signal from interferometric measurements (with analysis
of single-element experiments arising as a special case) and discuss trade-offs
with various data analysis choices. Given that interferometric measurements are
able to avoid a number of systematics inherent in single-element experiments,
our results suggest that interferometry ought to be explored as a complementary

However, strong constraints can be imposed if we take into account galactic
chemical enrichment. We extend the analysis of Weidner et al. and consider the
functional form of bottom-heavy IMFs used in recent works, where the high-mass
end slope is kept fixed to the Salpeter value, and a free parameter is
introduced to describe the slope at stellar masses below some pivot mass scale
(M<MP=0.5Msun). We find that no such time-independent parameterisation is
capable to reproduce the full set of constraints in the stellar populations of
massive ETGs - resting on the assumption that the analysis of gravity-sensitive
line strengths leads to a mass fraction at birth in stars with mass M<0.5Msun
above 60%. Most notably, the large amount of metal-poor gas locked in low-mass
stars during the early, strong phases of star formation results in average
stellar metallicities [M/H]<-0.6, well below the solar value. The conclusions
are unchanged if either the low-mass end cutoff, or the pivot mass are left as
free parameters, strengthening the case for a time-dependent IMF.

standard weakly interacting particles. Our analysis includes theoretical and
observational errors, accounts for tensions between input parameters of solar
models and can be easily extended to include other observational constraints.
We present two applications to test the method: the well studied case of axions
and axion-like particles and the more novel case of low mass hidden photons.
For axions we obtain an upper limit at $3\sigma$ for the axion-photon coupling
constant of $g_{a\gamma}\,<\,4.1 \cdot 10^{-10} \rm{GeV^{-1}}$. For hidden
photons we obtain the most restrictive upper limit available accross a wide

constraints based on the Standard Solar Models showing the power of using a

populations. There is growing evidence that the classical star-formation
mechanism by the direct cloud fragmentation process has difficulties
reproducing the observed abundance and binary properties of brown dwarfs and
very-low-mass stars. In particular, recent analytical derivations of the
stellar IMF exhibit a deficit of brown dwarfs compared to observational data.
Here we derive the residual mass function of brown dwarfs as an empirical
measure of the brown dwarf deficiency in recent star-formation models with
respect to observations and show that it is compatible with the substellar part
of the Thies-Kroupa IMF and the mass function obtained by numerical
simulations. We conclude that the existing models may be further improved by
including a substellar correction term that accounts for additional formation
channels like disk or filament fragmentation. The term ""peripheral
fragmentation"" is introduced here for such additional formation channels. In
addition, we present an updated analytical model of stellar and substellar
binarity. The resulting binary fraction and the dynamically evolved companion
mass-ratio distribution are in good agreement with observational data on
stellar and very-low-mass binaries in the Galactic field, in clusters, and in
dynamically unprocessed groups of stars if all stars form as binaries with
stellar companions. Cautionary notes are given on the proper analysis of mass
functions and the companion mass-ratio distribution and the interpretation of
the results. The existence of accretion disks around young brown dwarfs does
not imply that these form just like stars in direct fragmentation.

applications, each having its own structure, goals and requirements. Medium
access control (MAC) protocols play a significant role in WSNs and hence should
be tuned to the applications. However, there is no for selecting MAC protocols
for different situations. Therefore, it is hard to decide which MAC protocol is
good for a given situation. Having a precise model for each MAC protocol, on
the other hand, is almost impossible. Using the intuition that the protocols in
the same behavioral category perform similarly, our goal in this paper is to
introduce a general model that selects the protocol(s) that satisfy the given
requirements from the category that performs better for a given context. We
define the Combined Performance Function (CPF) to demonstrate the performance
of different categories protocols for different contexts. Having the general
model, we then discuss the model scalability for adding new protocols,
categories, requirements, and performance criteria. Considering energy
consumption and delay as the initial performance criteria of the model, we
focus on deriving mathematical models for them. The results extracted from CPF
are the same as the well-known rule of thumb for the MAC protocols that
verifies our model. We validate our models with the help of simulation study.

One crucial idea to improve the delay performance is to retrieve multiple data
copies by using parallel downloading threads. However, how to optimally
schedule these downloading threads to minimize the data retrieving delay
remains to be an important open problem. In this paper, we develop
low-complexity thread scheduling policies for several important classes of data
downloading time distributions, and prove that these policies are either
delay-optimal or within a constant gap from the optimum delay performance.
These theoretical results hold for an arbitrary arrival process of read
requests that may contain finite or infinite read requests, and for
heterogeneous MDS storage codes that can support diverse storage redundancy and
reliability requirements for different data files. Our numerical results show
that the delay performance of the proposed policies is significantly better

the new method to a spatial survival dataset previously analysed in Henderson

networks. We begin by obtaining the handoff rate for a mobile user in an
irregular cellular network with the access point locations modeled as a
homogeneous Poisson point process. The received signal-to-interference-ratio
(SIR) distribution along with a chosen SIR threshold is then used to obtain the
probability of coverage. To capture potential connection failures due to
mobility, we assume that a fraction of handoffs result in such failures.
Considering a multi-tier network with orthogonal spectrum allocation among
tiers and the maximum biased average received power as the tier association
metric, we derive the probability of coverage for two cases: 1) the user is
stationary (i.e., handoffs do not occur, or the system is not sensitive to
handoffs); 2) the user is mobile, and the system is sensitive to handoffs. We
derive the optimal bias factors to maximize the coverage. We show that when the
user is mobile, and the network is sensitive to handoffs, both the optimum tier
association and the probability of coverage depend on the user's speed; a
speed-dependent bias factor can then adjust the tier association to effectively
improve the coverage, and hence system performance, in a fully-loaded network.

discovery of supersymmetry. Thus a 126 GeV Higgs boson is problematic within
the Standard Model because of vacuum instability pointing to new physics beyond
the Standard Model. The problem of vacuum stability is overcome in the SUGRA
GUT model but the 126 GeV Higgs mass implies that the average SUSY scale lies
in the several TeV region. The largeness of the SUSY scale relieves the tension
on SUGRA models since it helps suppress flavor changing neutral currents and CP
violating effects and also helps in extending the proton life time arising from
baryon and lepton number violating dimension five operators. The geometry of
radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry and fine tuning in view of the
large SUSY scale are analyzed.Consistency with the Brookhaven $g_{\mu}-2$
result is discussed. It is also shown that a large SUSY scale implied by the
126 GeV Higgs boson mass allows for light gauginos (gluino, charginos,
neutralinos) and sleptons. These along with the lighter third generation
squarks are the prime candidates for discovery at RUN II of the LHC.
Implication of the 126 GeV Higgs boson for the direct search for dark matter is

are investigated within an extended nonlinear relativistic mean-field (RMF)
model. The critical densities for the formation of four different charge states
of \D are found to depend differently on the separate kinetic and potential
parts of nuclear symmetry energy, the first example of a microphysical property
of neutron stars to do so. Moreover, they are sensitive to the in-medium Delta
mass $m_{\Delta}$ and the completely unknown $\Delta$-$\rho$ coupling strength
$g_{\rho\Delta}$. In the universal baryon-meson coupling scheme where the
respective $\Delta$-meson and nucleon-meson coupling constants are assumed to
be the same, the critical density for the first $\Delta^-(1232)$ to appear is
found to be \rc=$(2.08\pm0.02)\rho_0$ using RMF model parameters consistent
with current constraints on all seven macroscopic parameters usually used to
characterize the equation of state (EoS) of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter
(ANM) at saturation density $\rho_0$. Moreover, the composition and the
mass-radius relation of neutron stars are found to depend significantly on the

mechanisms of scalar hyperbolic conservation laws. When the flux is convex, the
combination of diffusion and dispersion are known to give rise to monotonic and
oscillatory traveling waves that approximate shock waves. The zero-diffusion
limits of these traveling waves are dynamically expanding dispersive shock
waves (DSWs). A richer set of wave solutions can be found when the flux is
non-convex. This review compares the structure of solutions of Riemann problems
for a conservation law with non-convex, cubic flux regularized by two different
mechanisms: 1) dispersion in the modified Korteweg--de Vries (mKdV) equation;
and 2) a combination of diffusion and dispersion in the mKdV-Burgers equation.
In the first case, the possible dynamics involve two qualitatively different
types of DSWs, rarefaction waves (RWs) and kinks (monotonic fronts). In the
second case, in addition to RWs, there are traveling wave solutions
approximating both classical (Lax) and non-classical (undercompressive) shock
waves. Despite the singular nature of the zero-diffusion limit and rather
differing analytical approaches employed in the descriptions of dispersive and
diffusive-dispersive regularization, the resulting comparison of the two cases
reveals a number of striking parallels. In contrast to the case of convex flux,
the mKdVB to mKdV mapping is not one-to-one. The mKdV kink solution is
identified as an undercompressive DSW. Other prominent features, such as
shock-rarefactions, also find their purely dispersive counterparts involving
special contact DSWs, which exhibit features analogous to contact
discontinuities. This review describes an important link between two major
areas of applied mathematics, hyperbolic conservation laws and nonlinear
dispersive waves.

accretion discs - in particular i) whether or not the inner disc edge aligns
with the black hole spin and ii) whether the disc can maintain a smooth
transition between an aligned inner disc and a misaligned outer disc, known as
the Bardeen-Petterson effect. We employ high resolution 3D smoothed particle
hydrodynamics simulations of $\alpha$-discs subject to Lense-Thirring
precession, focussing on the bending wave regime where the disc viscosity is
smaller than the aspect ratio $\alpha \lesssim H/R$. We first address the
controversy in the literature regarding possible steady-state oscillations of
the tilt close to the black hole. We successfully recover such oscillations in
3D at both small and moderate inclinations ($\lesssim 15^{\circ}$), provided
both Lense-Thirring and Einstein precession are present, sufficient resolution
is employed, and provided the disc is not so thick so as to simply accrete
misaligned. Second, we find that discs inclined by more than a few degrees in
general steepen and break rather than maintain a smooth transition, again in
contrast to previous findings, but only once the disc scale height is
adequately resolved. Finally, we find that when the disc plane is misaligned to
the black hole spin by a large angle, the disc 'tears' into discrete rings
which precess effectively independently and cause rapid accretion, consistent
with previous findings in the diffusive regime ($\alpha \gtrsim H/R$). Thus
misalignment between the disc and the spin axis of the black hole provides a
robust mechanism for growing black holes quickly, regardless of whether the
disc is thick or thin.

supernovae (CCSNe) may be neutrino driven, since the first suggestion of this
by Colgate and White nearly five decades ago. Computational models have become
increasingly sophisticated, first in one spatial dimension assuming spherical
symmetry, then in two spatial dimensions assuming axisymmetry, and now in three
spatial dimensions with no imposed symmetries. The increase in the number of
spatial dimensions has been accompanied by an increase in the physics included
in the models, and an increase in the sophistication with which this physics
has been modeled. Computation has played an essential role in the development
of CCSN theory, not simply for the obvious reason that such multidimensional,
multi-physics, nonlinear events cannot possibly be fully captured analytically,
but for its role in discovery. In particular, the discovery of the standing
accretion shock instability (SASI) through computation about a decade ago has
impacted all simulations performed since then. Today, we appear to be at a
threshold, where neutrinos, neutrino-driven convection, and the SASI, working
together over time scales significantly longer than had been anticipated in the
past, are able to generate explosions, and in some cases, robust explosions, in
a number of axisymmetric models. But how will this play out in three
dimensions? Early results from the first three-dimensional (3D), multi-physics
simulation of the ""Oak Ridge"" group are promising. I will discuss the essential
components of today's models and the requirements of realistic CCSN modeling,

therefore it could be witnessed by proper uncertainty game experimentally. We
first investigate an uncertainty game between a free falling observer and his
static partner holding a quantum memory initially entangled with the quantum
system to be measured. Due to the information loss from Hawking decoherence, we
find an inevitable increase of the uncertainty on the outcome of measurements
in the view of static observer, which is dependent on the mass of the black
hole, the distance of observer from event horizon, and the mode frequency of
quantum memory. To illustrate the generality of this paradigm, we relate the
entropic uncertainty bound with other uncertainty probe, e.g., time-energy
uncertainty. In an alternative game between two static players, we show that
quantum information of qubit can be transferred to quantum memory through a
bath of fluctuating quantum fields outside the black hole. For a particular
choice of initial state, we show that the Hawking decoherence cannot counteract
entanglement generation after the dynamical evolution of system, which triggers
an effectively reduced uncertainty bound that violates the intrinsic limit
$-\log_2c$. Numerically estimation for a proper choice of initial state shows
that our result is comparable with possible real experiments. Finally, a
discussion on the black hole firewall paradox in the context of entropic
uncertainty relation is given.

by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse
error, and nearly linear in the product $\tau$ of the evolution time, the

stretching mode was observed. In-plane-bending of C-H was in a range of 7.6-9.2
micrometer. Both C-H out-of plane bending and C-C stretching were accompanied
from 11.4 to 14.3 micrometer. Astronomically observed emission peaks of 3.3,
6.2, 7.6, 7.8, 8.6, 11.2, 12.7, 13.5 and 14.3 micrometer were compared well

there exists a unique strong solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes
equations with general Navier-slip boundary conditions in an interval of time
which is uniform in the vanishing viscosity limit. The solution is uniformly
bounded in a conormal Sobolev space and is uniform bounded in $W^{1,\infty}$.
It is also shown that the boundary layer for the density is weaker than the one
for the velocity field. In particular, it is proved that the velocity will be
uniform bounded in $L^\infty(0,T;H^2)$ when the boundary is flat and the
Navier-Stokes system is supplemented with the special boundary condition

viscous solutions to the inviscid ones in $L^\infty(0,T;L^2)$,
$L^\infty(0,T;H^1)$ and $L^\infty([0,T]\times\Omega)$ with a rate of

  Energy Transfer over Frequency-Selective Channel","to appear in IEEE Transactions on Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the training design problem for multiple-input
single-output (MISO) wireless energy transfer (WET) systems in
frequency-selective channels, where the frequency-diversity and
energy-beamforming gains can be both reaped to maximize the transferred energy
by efficiently learning the channel state information (CSI) at the energy
transmitter (ET). By exploiting channel reciprocity, a new two-phase channel
training scheme is proposed to achieve the diversity and beamforming gains,
respectively. In the first phase, pilot signals are sent from the energy
receiver (ER) over a selected subset of the available frequency sub-bands,
through which the ET determines a certain number of ""strongest"" sub-bands with
largest antenna sum-power gains and sends their indices to the ER. In the
second phase, the selected sub-bands are further trained by the ER, so that the
ET obtains a refined estimate of the corresponding MISO channels to implement
energy beamforming for WET. A training design problem is formulated and
optimally solved, which takes into account the channel training overhead by
maximizing the net harvested energy at the ER, defined as the average harvested
energy offset by that consumed in the two-phase training. Moreover, asymptotic
analysis is obtained for systems with a large number of antennas or a large
number of sub-bands to gain useful insights on the optimal training design.
Finally, numerical results are provided to corroborate our analysis and show
the effectiveness of the proposed scheme that optimally balances the diversity
and beamforming gains achieved in MISO WET systems with limited-energy
training.

high-quality h-BN monolayer film with the largest single crystalline domain
sizes up to 72 micrometer in edge length using a folded Cu enclosure approach.
The highly-confined growth space with this facile and unique approach enables
the drastic decrease of nucleation centers together with the effective
suppression of hydrogen etching reaction. It is revealed, for the first time,
that the orientations of as-grown h-BN monolayers are strongly correlated with
the crystalline facets of growth substrates, with the Cu (111) being the best
substrate for growing high-quality single crystalline h-BN monolayer,
consistent with the density functional theory calculations. The present study
offers a practical pathway for growing high-quality h-BN films and deepens the
fundamental understanding of h-BN growth process.

measures the optimal partition of the vertices into 2 parts with relatively few
edges between them based upon the sizes of the parts. The well-known Cheeger's
inequality states that $2 \lambda_1 \le h_G \le \sqrt {2 \lambda_1}$ where
$\lambda_1$ is the minimum nontrivial eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian
matrix.
  Recent work has generalized the concept of the Cheeger constant when
partitioning the vertices of a graph into $k > 2$ parts. While there are
several approaches, recent results have shown these higher-order Cheeger
constants to be tightly controlled by $\lambda_{k-1}$, the $(k-1)$-th
nontrivial eigenvalue, to within a quadratic factor.
  We present a new higher-order Cheeger inequality with several new
perspectives. First, we use an alternative higher-order Cheeger constant which
considers an ""average case"" approach. We show this measure is related to the
average of the first $k-1$ nontrivial eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian
matrix. Further, using recent techniques, our results provide linear
inequalities using the $\infty$-norms of the corresponding eigenvectors.
Consequently, unlike previous results, this result is relevant even when
$\lambda_{k-1} \to 1$.

fundamentally different from traditional passive scenes like QR codes because
image formation is based on display emittance, not surface reflectance.
Detecting and decoding the message requires careful photometric modeling for
computational message recovery. Unlike standard watermarking and steganography
methods that lie outside the domain of computer vision, our message recovery
algorithm uses illumination to optically communicate hidden messages in real
world scenes. The key innovation of our approach is an algorithm that performs
simultaneous radiometric calibration and message recovery in one convex
optimization problem. By modeling the photometry of the system using a
camera-display transfer function (CDTF), we derive a physics-based kernel
function for support vector machine classification. We demonstrate that our

classified as a Mott-type insulator. Based on a systematic density functional
theory (DFT) study with local, semilocal, and hybrid exchange-correlation
functionals, we reveal that the Ir t2g states exhibit large splittings and
one-dimensional electronic states along the c axis due to a tetragonal crystal
field. Our hybrid DFT calculation adequately describes the antiferromagnetic
(AFM) order along the c direction via a superexchange interaction between Ir4+
spins. Furthermore, the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) hybridizes the t2g states to
open an insulating gap. These results indicate that CaIrO3 can be represented
as a spin-orbit Slater insulator, driven by the interplay between a long-range
AFM order and the SOC. Such a Slater mechanism for the gap formation is also
demonstrated by the DFT + dynamical mean field theory calculation, where the
metal-insulator transition and the paramagnetic to AFM phase transition are
concomitant with each other.

determinant-based criterion performs well for correlated variables by
integrating the covariance structure and is competitive to many other existing
rules. The criterion however requires the measurement dimension be smaller than
the sample size. The trace-based criterion in contrast, is an independence rule
and effective in the ""large dimension-small sample size"" scenario. An appealing
property of these two criteria is that their implementation is straightforward
and there is no need for preliminary variable selection or use of turning
parameters. Their asymptotic misclassification probabilities are derived using
the theory of large dimensional random matrices. Their competitive performances
are illustrated by intensive Monte Carlo experiments and a real data analysis.

contradiction with local realism. Here we report the first experimental
observation of BOs of two-particle Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states (EPR), whose
associated N-particle wave functions are nonlocal by nature. The time evolution
of two-photon EPR states in Bloch-oscillators, whether symmetric, antisymmetric

antibunching to bunching. Consequently, the initial state can be tailored to
produce spatial correlations akin to bosons, fermions or anyons. These results

black hole. We use the Shakura-Sunyaev {\alpha} viscosity prescription to
estimate the turbulent viscosity for all major viscous stress tensors. We
investigate how a gas ring which is initially assumed to rotate with Keplerian
angular velocity is accreted on to a black hole and hence forms accretion disc
in the presence of turbulent viscosity. We show that the centrifugal pressure
supported sub-Keplerian flow with shocks forms when the ring starts to disperse
with inclusion of relatively small amount of viscosity. But, if the viscosity
is above the critical value, the shock disappears altogether and the whole disc
becomes Kepleiran which is subsonic everywhere except in a region close to the
horizon, where it supersonically enters to the black hole. We discovered a
multiple valued Mach number solution and the corresponding density
distributions that connects matter (a) from the initial Keplerian gas ring to a
sub-Keplerian disc with shocks in presence of small amount of viscosity and (b)
from the sub-Keplerian flow to a Keplerian disc in presence of huge amount of

H$_{2}$S sample [arXiv: 1412.0460 (2014)] which is associates with the
elemental decomposition into H$_{3}$S [Sci. Rep. 4, 6968 (2014)]. Therefore, on
what pressure H$_{2}$S can decompose and which kind of the products of
decomposition urgent need to be solved. In this paper, we have performed an
extensive structural study on different stoichiometries H$_{n}$S with ${n> 1}$
under high pressure using $ab$ $initio$ calculations. Our results show that
H$_{2}$S is stable below 50 GPa and decomposes into H$_3$S and sulfur at high
pressure, while H$_{3}$S is stable at least up to 300 GPa. The other
hydrogen-rich H$_{4}$S, H$_{5}$S, and H$_{6}$S are unstable in the pressure
range from 20 to 300 GPa.

continuous functions $C(K^n)$ or equivalently the $n$-fold injective tensor
product $\hat\bigotimes_{\varepsilon}C(K)$ or the Banach space of vector valued
continuous functions $C(K, C(K, C(K ..., C(K)...)$. We address the question of
the existence of complemented copies of $c_0(\omega_1)$ in
$\hat\bigotimes_{\varepsilon}C(K)$ under the hypothesis that $C(K)$ contains an
isomorphic copy of $c_0(\omega_1)$. This is related to the results of E. Saab
and P. Saab that $X\hat\otimes_\varepsilon Y$ contains a complemented copy of
$c_0$, if one of the infinite dimensional Banach spaces $X$ or $Y$ contains a
copy of $c_0$ and of E. M. Galego and J. Hagler that it follows from Martin's
Maximum that if $C(K)$ has density $\omega_1$ and contains a copy of
$c_0(\omega_1)$, then $C(K\times K)$ contains a complemented copy
$c_0(\omega_1)$.
  The main result is that under the assumption of $\clubsuit$ for every $n\in
N$ there is a compact Hausdorff space $K_n$ of weight $\omega_1$ such that
$C(K)$ is Lindel\""of in the weak topology, $C(K_n)$ contains a copy of

$c_0(\omega_1)$ while $C(K_n^{n+1})$ does contain a complemented copy of
$c_0(\omega_1)$. This shows that additional set-theoretic assumptions in Galego

necessary as well as clarifies in the negative direction the matter unsettled
in a paper of Dow, Junnila and Pelant whether half-pcc Banach spaces must be

$\mathbf{z}=\mathbf{Ax}$ arise in a range of applications in nonlinear
filtering and regression. Approximate Message Passing (AMP) methods, based on

admit precise analyses with testable conditions for optimality for large i.i.d.
transforms $\mathbf{A}$. However, the algorithms can easily diverge for general
$\mathbf{A}$. This paper presents a convergent approach to the generalized AMP
(GAMP) algorithm based on direct minimization of a large-system limit
approximation of the Bethe Free Energy (LSL-BFE). The proposed method uses a
double-loop procedure, where the outer loop successively linearizes the LSL-BFE
and the inner loop minimizes the linearized LSL-BFE using the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The proposed method, called ADMM-GAMP,
is similar in structure to the original GAMP method, but with an additional
least-squares minimization. It is shown that for strictly convex, smooth
penalties, ADMM-GAMP is guaranteed to converge to a local minima of the
LSL-BFE, thus providing a convergent alternative to GAMP that is stable under
arbitrary transforms. Simulations are also presented that demonstrate the
robustness of the method for non-convex penalties as well.

conversion for electron Bernstein wave (EBW) excitation. It consists of the
mode conversion of the ordinary mode, entering the plasma from the low field
side of the tokamak, into the extraordinary (X) mode at a mirror-polarizer
located at the high field side. The X mode propagates back to the plasma,
passes through electron cyclotron resonance and experiences a subsequent X to
EBW mode conversion near the upper hybrid resonance. Finally the excited EBW
mode is totally absorbed at the Doppler shifted electron cyclotron resonance.
The absorption of EBW remains high even in cold rarefied plasmas. Furthermore,
EBW can generate significant plasma current giving the prospect of a fully
solenoid-free plasma start-up. First experiments using this scheme were carried
out on MAST [V. Shevchenko et al, Nuclear Fusion 50, 022004 (2010)]. Plasma
currents up to 33 kA have been achieved using 28 GHz 100kW 90ms RF pulses.
Recently experimental results were extended to longer RF pulses showing further
increase of plasma currents generated by RF power alone. A record current of
73kA has been achieved with 450ms RF pulse of similar power. The current drive
enhancement was mainly achieved due to RF pulse extension and further
optimisation of the start-up scenario.

estimates for the Landau equation, which are satisfying only when $\gamma \in
[-1,0)$. We next prove, under some appropriate conditions on the initial data,
the so-called propagation of molecular chaos, i.e. that the empirical measure
of the particle system converges to the unique solution of the Landau equation.
The main difficulty is the presence of a singularity in the equation. When
$\gamma \in (-1,0)$, the strong-weak uniqueness estimate allows us to use a
coupling argument and to obtain a rate of convergence. When $\gamma \in
(-2,-1]$, we use the classical martingale method introduced by McKean. To
control the singularity, we have to take advantage of the regularity provided
by the entropy dissipation. Unfortunately, this dissipation is too weak for
some (very rare) aligned configurations. We thus introduce a perturbed system
with an additional noise, show the propagation of chaos for that perturbed
system and finally prove that the additional noise is almost never used in the

order of $G$. In this paper we show, for a connected graph $G$ of order $n$
with minimum degree $\delta$, that $trc(G)\leq6n/{(\delta+1)}+28$ for
$\delta\geq\sqrt{n-2}-1$ and $n\geq 291$, while $trc(G)\leq7n/{(\delta+1)}+32$
for $16\leq\delta\leq\sqrt{n-2}-2$ and
$trc(G)\leq7n/{(\delta+1)}+4C(\delta)+12$ for $6\leq\delta\leq15$, where
$C(\delta)=e^{\frac{3\log({\delta}^3+2{\delta}^2+3)-3(\log3-1)}{\delta-3}}-2$.
This implies that when $\delta$ is in linear with $n$, then the total rainbow
number $trc(G)$ is a constant. We also show that $trc(G)\leq 7n/4-3$ for
$\delta=3$, $trc(G)\leq8n/5-13/5$ for $\delta=4$ and $trc(G)\leq3n/2-3$ for
$\delta=5$. Furthermore, an example shows that our bound can be seen tight up
to additive factors when $\delta\geq\sqrt{n-2}-1$.

transfer has potential applications in energy harvesting and is important for
understanding functioning of several biological systems. We numerically
demonstrate large-scale flow-induced deformation as an effective passive heat
transfer enhancement technique. An in-house, strongly-coupled fluid-structure
interaction (FSI) solver is employed in which flow and structure solvers are
based on sharp-interface immersed boundary and finite element method,
respectively. In the present work, we validate convective heat transfer module
of the in-house FSI solver against several benchmark examples of conduction and
convective heat transfer including moving structure boundaries. The thermal
augmentation is investigated as well as quantified for the flow-induced
deformation of an elastic thin plate attached to lee side of a rigid cylinder
in a heated channel laminar flow. We show that the wake vortices past the plate
sweep higher sources of vorticity generated on the channel walls out into the
high velocity regions, promoting the mixing of the fluid. The self-sustained
motion of the plate assists in convective mixing, augmenting convection in bulk
and near the walls, and thereby reducing thermal boundary layer thickness as
well as improving Nusselt number at the channel walls. We quantify the thermal
improvement with respect to channel flow without any bluff body and analyze the
role of Reynolds number, Prandtl number and material properties of the plate in
the thermal augmentation.

deep multicolor wide--field optical images to distinguish star formation from
stellar mass, to properly calculate the mass in galaxies of low mass, those
outside the red sequence, and to allow a contribution from galaxies of low mass
that is clustercentric dependent. We pay special attention to issues and
contributions that are usually underrated, yet are major sources of
uncertainty, and we present an approach that allows us to account for all of
them. Here we present the results for three very massive clusters at
$z\sim0.45$, MACSJ1206.2-0847, MACSJ0329.6-0211, and RXJ1347.5-1145. We find
that stellar mass and total matter are closely distributed on scales from about
150 kpc to 2.5 Mpc: the stellar-to-total mass ratio is radially constant. We
find that the characteristic mass stays constant across clustercentric radii

the anti-plane strain energy release rate is expressed by means of the mode-III

addition to CO whereas other NH$_2$-containing molecules such as formamide,
NH$_2$CHO, can. Submillimeter spectra of several massive hot core regions were
taken with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Abundances are determined with
the rotational diagram method where possible. Methylamine is not detected,
giving upper limit column densities between 1.9 $-$ 6.4 $\times$ 10$^{16}$

with previously obtained JCMT data analyzed in the same way, abundance ratios
of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$, NH$_{2}$CHO and CH$_{3}$CN with respect to each other and
to CH$_{3}$OH are determined. These ratios are compared with Sagittarius B2
observations, where all species are detected, and to hot core models. The
observed ratios suggest that both methylamine and formamide are overproduced by
up to an order of magnitude in hot core models. Acetonitrile is however
underproduced. The proposed chemical schemes leading to these molecules are
discussed and reactions that need further laboratory studies are identified.
The upper limits obtained in this paper can be used to guide future

studied in the literature, few results address physical transmission
constraints since it is challenging to analyze the network connectivity in
consideration of both the $q$-composite scheme and transmission constraints
together. These transmission constraints reflect real-world implementations of

unreliability of wireless links by modeling each link being independently

ultimately resolved the long-standing discrepancy between the numerical

the horizontal plates. For the studied Rayleigh numbers Ra between $10^8$ and
$10^{11}$ the heat transport is lower for $\Gamma = 0.33$ than for $\Gamma = 1$
in case of no-slip sidewalls. This is surprisingly opposite for stress-free
sidewalls, where the heat transport increases for lower aspect-ratio. In wider
cells the aspect-ratio dependence is observed to disappear for $\text{Ra} \ge
10^{10}$. Two distinct flow types with very different dynamics can be seen,
mostly dependent on the plate velocity boundary condition, namely roll-like
flow and horizontal zonal flow, which have a substantial effect on the dynamics
and heat transport in the system. The predominantly horizontal zonal flow
suppresses heat flux and is observed for stress-free and asymmetric plates. Low
aspect-ratio periodic sidewall simulations with a no-slip boundary condition on
the plates also exhibit zonal flow. In all the other cases, the flow is
roll-like. In two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, the velocity

decreasing number of C 2p states as a function of carbon content. These changes
signify a systematic redistribution in orbital occupation due to
charge-transfer effects at the domain-size dependent carbide/matrix interfaces.

primarily determined by Tc and the superconducting (SC) coherence length,
{\xi}. In systems with strong structural and electronic anisotropies, the
interlayer separation, s, plays a significant role. In cuprates, the pseudogap
(PG) correlation induces a downturn in the temperature dependent resistivity.
As Tc is approached from above, this downturn in the resistivity is supposed to
either i) add to or ii) join smoothly to that due to paraconductivity caused by
short-lived Cooper pairs. It is important to differentiate between these two
possibilities since they are closely linked to the origin of the PG. It would
be reasonable to assume that if the first scenario is correct then the PG has a
non-SC origin, while the second scenario, if found to hold, would relate
precursor pairing to the PG correlations. We have studied the in-plane
fluctuation conductivity of two c-axis oriented thin films of
Y0.95Ca0.05Ba2Cu3O7-d with similar hole contents (p), p = 0.165 (optimally
doped) and p = 0.184 (slightly overdoped). The hole contents are fixed at these
values so that the PG affects the resistivity data only at temperatures close
to Tc. Analysis of paraconductivity, {\Delta}{\sigma}ab(T), within the
mean-field Gaussian Ginzburg-Landau (MFGGL) framework reveals different
features for the optimally doped (OPD) and the slightly overdoped (SOD)
compounds. The excess conductivity due to Cooper pair fluctuations of the SOD
sample can be described reasonably well by the MFGGL formalism. The excess
conductivity of the OPD compound, on the other hand, cannot be accounted for by
the MFGGL formalism with reasonable set of parameters. There is a significant
added contribution to {\Delta}{\sigma}ab(T) for the OPD sample which appears to
come from the presence of a PG. These findings point towards a non-pairing
origin of the PG.

with early experimental and present Brownian dynamic simulation results. With
increasing concentration, the dispersion of electrolyte friction is found to
occur at increasingly higher frequency, due to the faster relaxation of the ion
atmosphere. The wave number dependence of total dynamic structure factor
F(k,t), exhibits markedly different relaxation dynamics at different length
scales. At small wave numbers, we find the emergence of a step-like relaxation,
indicating the presence of both fast and slow time scales in the system. Such
behaviour allows an intriguing analogy with temperature dependent relaxation
dynamics of supercooled liquids. We find that solvation dynamics of a tagged

stretched exponential form. The emergence of the power law in solvation

time surfaces are always spacelike near the big bang, while at late times (near
the crunch or the extreme far future), they are only timelike under special
circumstances. At intermediate times, timelike $S$ regions are common unless
the variation of the bang time is restricted. The regions where these surfaces

FLAMES radial velocity and emission line measurements for 1135 PNe, of which
486 are new. Another 132 PN radial velocities are available from the

lattice Dirac operator, focussing on calculating the eigenvalues using a method
similar to the eigCG algorithm used for other Dirac operators. The overlap
operator, which contains several theoretical advantages over other formulations
of lattice Quantum Chromodynamics, is more computationally expensive because it
requires the computation of the matrix sign function. The principle change made
compared to deflation methods for other formulations of lattice QCD is that it
is necessary for best performance to tune or relax the accuracy of the matrix
sign function as the computation proceeds.
  We adapt the eigCG algorithm for two inversion algorithms for overlap
fermions, GMRESR(relCG) and GMRESR(relSUMR). Before deflation, the rate of
convergence of these routines in terms of iterations is similar, but, since the
Shifted Unitary Minimal Residual (SUMR) algorithm only requires one call to the
matrix sign function compared to the two calls required for Conjugate Gradient
(CG), SUMR is usually preferred for single inversions of the Dirac operator. We
construct bounds for the required accuracy of the matrix sign function during
the eigenvalue calculation. For the SUMR algorithm, we use a Galerkin
projection to perform the deflation; while for the CG algorithm, we are able to
use a considerably superior spectral pre-conditioner. The superior performance
of the spectral preconditioner, and its need for less accurate eigenvalues,
almost erodes SUMR's advantage over CG as an inversion algorithm.
  We see factor of three gains for the inversion algorithm from the deflation
on our small test lattices. There is, however, a significant cost in the
eigenvalue calculation because we cannot relax the accuracy of the matrix sign
function as aggressively when calculating the eigenvalues as we do while
performing the inversions.

Cl$_{2}$-NDI (naphthalene diimide) single crystals is analysed over a
temperature range between 175 K and 300 K. Upon cooling from room temperature
to 175 K the electron mobility along the direction of preferred transport
monotonously increases from 1.5 cm$^{2}$/Vs to 2.8 cm$^{2}$/Vs according to a
distinct temperature relation of $~T^{-1.3}$. At first glance, these
characteristics allude to a coherent, i.e. band-like charge carrier transport
predominantly governed by inelastic scattering with accoustic phonons. However,
as we will demonstrate, the experimental mobility data can be consistently
described within the framework of incoherent, hopping-type transport modeled by
Levich-Jortner rates, explicitly accounting for the inner and outer relaxation
energies related to thermally induced lattice effects and enhanced
electron-phonon interaction at elevated temperatures. Complementary
band-structure calculations yielding temperature dependent effective mass
tensors deviate stronger from experimentally observed spatially anisotropic
transport behavior. Thus, these results hint at the fact that by the particular
interplay of the transport energies the mobility of a given organic
semiconducting material might appear to be band-like in a certain temperature
regime even though the underlying charge carrier transport can be of
incoherent, hopping-type nature. Building on this description, we further
explore the role of the intermolecular electronic coupling and develop a
procedure to distinguish between its dependence on static and dynamic lattice
deformation upon temperature variation.

Alternative MAT (SAMAT), which exploits both channel statistics and delayed
CSIT. Firstly, with statistical CSIT only, we focus on statistical beamforming
(SBF) design that maximizes a lower bound on the ergodic sum-rate. Secondly,
relying on both statistical and delayed CSIT, an iterative algorithm is
proposed to compute the precoding vectors of Alternative MAT (AMAT), originally
proposed by Yang et al., which maximizes an approximation of the ergodic
sum-rate with equal power allocation. Finally, via proper power allocation, the
SAMAT framework is proposed to softly bridge between SBF and AMAT for an
arbitrary number of transmit antennas and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A
necessary condition for the power allocation optimization is identified from
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The optimum power allocation to
maximize an ergodic sum-rate approximation is computed using Sequential
Quadratic Programming (SQP). Simulation results show that the proposed SAMAT

Probab. Math. Stat. 15, 101--120 (2018)",,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a sequence of continuous-time irreducible reversible Markov chains
and a sequence of initial distributions, $\mu_n$. The sequence is said to
exhibit $\mu_n$-cutoff if the convergence to stationarity in total variation
distance is abrupt, w.r.t. this sequence of initial distributions.
  In this work we give a characterization of $\mu_n$-cutoff for an arbitrary
sequence of initial distributions $\mu_n$ (in the above setup). Our
characterization is expressed in terms of hitting times of sets which are
""worst"" w.r.t. $\mu_n$.
  Consider a Markov chain on $\Omega$ whose stationary distribution in $\pi$.
Let $t_{\mathrm{H}}(\alpha) :=\max_{x \in \Omega,A \subset \Omega :\,\pi(A) \ge
\alpha}\mathbb{E}_{x}[T_{A}]$ be the expected hitting time of the worst set of
size at least $\alpha$. It was recently proved by Peres and Sousi and
independently by Oliveira that $t_{\mathrm{H}}(1/4) $ captures the order of the
mixing time. In this work we further refine this connection and show that
$\mu_n$-cutoff can be characterized in terms of concentration of hitting times
(starting from $\mu_n$) of sets which are worst in expectation w.r.t. $\mu_n$.
Conversely, we construct a counter-example which demonstrates that in general
cutoff (as opposed to cutoff w.r.t. a certain sequence of initial
distributions) cannot be characterized in this manner.
  Finally, we also prove that there exists an absolute constant $C$ such that
for every Markov chain $\epsilon(
t_{\mathrm{H}}(\epsilon)-t_{\mathrm{H}}(1-\epsilon)) \le Ct_{\mathrm{rel}}
|\log \epsilon|$, for all $0< \epsilon < 1/2$, where $t_{\mathrm{rel}} $ is the
inverse of the spectral gap of the chain.

variety of spiralling motions in the solar plasma. These spirals vary in
properties, but are observed to be abundant at the solar surface. In this work
these spirals are studied for their potential as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave
generation mechanisms. The inter-granular lanes, where these spirals are
commonly observed, are also regions where the magnetic field strength is higher
than average. This combination of magnetic field and spiralling plasma is a
recipe for the generation of Alfv\'en waves and other MHD waves.
  This work employs numerical simulations of a self-similar magnetic flux tube
embedded in a realistic, gravitationally stratified, solar atmosphere to study
the effects of a single magnetic flux tube perturbed by a logarithmic velocity
spiral driver. The expansion factor of the logarithmic spiral driver is varied
and multiple simulations are run for a range of values of the expansion factor
centred around observational constraints.
  The simulations are analysed using `flux surfaces' constructed from the
magnetic field lines so that the vectors perpendicular, parallel and azimuthal
to the local magnetic field vector can be calculated. The results of this
analysis show that the Alfv\'en wave is the dominant wave for lower values of
the expansion factor, whereas, for the higher values the parallel component is
dominant. This transition occurs within the range of the observational
constraints, meaning that spiral drivers, as observed in the solar photosphere,
have the potential to generate a variety of MHD wave modes.

variation of the semi-major axis of an asteroid. Using radar measurements and
astrometric observations, it is possible to measure a drift in semi-major axis
through orbit determination. This paper aims to detect a reliable drift in
semi-major axis of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from ground-based observations
and to investigate the impact of precovery observations and the future Gaia
catalogue in the detection of a secular drift in semi-major axis. We have
developed a precise dynamical model of an asteroid's motion taking the
Yarkovsky acceleration into account and allowing the fitting of the drift in
semi-major axis. Using statistical methods, we investigate the quality and the
robustness of the detection. By filtering spurious detections with an estimated
maximum drift depending on the asteroid's size, we found 46 NEAs with a
reliable drift in semi-major axis in good agreement with the previous studies.
The measure of the drift leads to a better orbit determination and constrains
some physical parameters of these objects. Our results are in good agreement
with the 1/D dependence of the drift and with the expected ratio of prograde
and retrograde NEAs. We show that the uncertainty of the drift mainly depends
on the length of orbital arc and in this way we highlight the importance of the
precovery observations and data mining in the detection of consistent drift.
Finally, we discuss the impact of Gaia catalogue in the determination of drift
in semi-major axis.

S would be over abundant if clathrates were the primary carrier of Jupiter's

due to the formation troilite (FeS). Here, this depletion is quantitatively
explored by modeling the coupled dynamical and chemical evolution of Fe grains
in the solar nebula. It is found that disks that undergo rapid radial expansion
from an initially compact state may allow sufficient production of FeS and
carry H$_{2}$S-depleted gas outward where ices would form, providing the
conditions needed for S-depleted clathrates to form. However, this expansion
would also carry FeS grains to this region, which could also be incorporated
into planetesimals. Thus for clathrates to be a viable source of volatiles,
models must account for the presence of both H$_{2}$S in FeS in the outer solar
nebula.

interdependent in the incident management system. System costs will be
excessive if delay regarding routing decisions is ignored when locating

routing problem of emergency response units on freeways. The principle is to
begin with a location phase for managing initial incidents and to progress
through a routing phase for managing the stochastic occurrence of next
incidents. Previous models used the frequency of independent incidents and
ignored scenarios in which two incidents occurred within proximal regions and
intervals. The proposed analytical model relaxes the structural assumptions of
Poisson process (independent increments) and incorporates evolution of primary
and secondary incident probabilities over time. The proposed mathematical model
overcomes several limiting assumptions of the previous models, such as no
waiting-time and returning rule to original depot. Our stochastic programming
method hedges well against a wide range of scenarios in which probabilities of
a sequence of incidents are assigned. The initial non-linear stochastic model
is linearized. As a long-term strategy, the model incorporates flexibility in
choosing the locations. The temporal locations flexible to a future
policy-change are compared with current practice that locates all units in one
permanent depot.

correctly evaluate the actual sustainability of their implementation. Emergy
analysis is one of the possible methods useful for such an assessment. This
work aims to demonstrate how the emergy approach can be used to assess the
sustainability of wind energy resource in Europe. The Emergy Index of
Sustainability (EIS) and the Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) are used to analyze 90
stations of European regions for three types of wind turbines. To do so, the
simplified Chou wind turbine model is used for different set of parameters as:
nominal power and size of the wind turbines, and cut-in and cut-out wind
speeds. Based on the calculation of the emergy indices, a mapping is proposed
to identify the most appropriate locations for an implementation of wind
turbines in European regions. The influence of the wind turbine type on the
sustainability is also analyzed, in link with the local wind resource. Thus, it
is concluded that the emergy sustainability indices are sensitive to the wind
turbine design parameters (size, cut-in and cut-out wind speed).

mathematical modeling of immuno-epidemiology. The aim of this paper is twofold.
First, we provide an overview of existing models for waning of

The analysis approach draws on data from high-precision phasor measurement
units (micro-synchrophasors or uPMUs) for distribution systems. A key fact is
that time-series voltage phasors taken from a distribution network show
specific patterns regarding connected phases at measurement points. The
algorithm is based on analyzing crosscorrelations over voltage magnitudes along
with phase angle differences on two candidate phases to be matched. If two
measurement points are on the same phase, large positive voltage magnitude
correlations and small voltage angle differences should be observed. The
algorithm is initially validated using the IEEE 13-bus model, and subsequently
with actual uPMU measurements on a 12-kV feeder.

switches are not equipped with measurement devices and communication links.
However, knowledge about the actual topology is critical for safe and reliable
grid operation. This paper proposes a voting-based topology detection method
based on micro-synchrophasor measurements. The minimal difference between
measured and calculated voltage angle or voltage magnitude, respectively,
indicates the actual topology. Micro-synchrophasors or micro-Phasor Measurement
Units ({\mu}PMU) are high-precision devices that can measure voltage angle
differences on the order of ten millidegrees. This accuracy is important for
distribution networks due to the smaller angle differences as compared to
transmission networks. For this paper, a microgrid test bed is implemented in
MATLAB with simulated measurements from {\mu}PMUs as well as SCADA measurement
devices. The results show that topologies can be detected with high accuracy.
Additionally, topology detection by voltage angle shows better results than
detection by voltage magnitude.

shapes in quiet-Sun regions and coronal holes (CHs). A single Gaussian fit of
the line profile provides an adequate approximation in quiet-Sun areas, whereas
a strong shoulder on the long-wavelength side is a systematic feature in CHs.
Although this has been noticed since 1999, no physical reason for the peculiar
shape could be given. In an attempt to identify the cause of this peculiarity,
we address three problems that could not be conclusively resolved in a review
article by a study team of the International Space Science Institute (ISSI;
Wilhelm et al. 2011) : (1) The physical processes operating at the base and
inside of plumes as well as their interaction with the solar wind (SW). (2) The
possible contribution of plume plasma to the fast SW streams. (3) The signature
of the first-ionization potential (FIP) effect between plumes and inter-plume
regions (IPRs). Before the spectroscopic peculiarities in IPRs and plumes in
polar coronal holes (PCHs) can be further investigated with the instrument
Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) aboard the Solar
and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), it is mandatory to summarize the results
of the review to place the spectroscopic observations into context. Finally, a
plume model is proposed that satisfactorily explains the plasma flows up and
down the plume field lines and leads to the shape of the neon line in PCHs.
