post-flare phases of an M3.2 class solar flare. The flare originated on 2013
May 17 and belonged to active region NOAA 11748. We detected strong He I 10830
A emission in the flare. The red component of the He I triplet peaks at an
intensity ratio to the continuum of about 1.86. During the flare, He I Stokes V
is substantially larger and appears reversed compared to the usually larger Si
I Stokes V profile. The photospheric Si I inversions of the four Stokes
profiles reveal the following: (1) the magnetic field strength in the
photosphere decreases or is even absent during the flare phase, as compared to
the pre-flare phase. However, this decrease is not permanent. After the flare
the magnetic field recovers its pre-flare configuration in a short time (i.e.,
in 30 minutes after the flare). (2) In the photosphere, the line-of-sight
velocities show a regular granular up- and down-flow pattern before the flare
erupts. During the flare, upflows (blueshifts) dominate the area where the
flare is produced. Evaporation rates of ~ $10^{-3}$ and ~ $10^{-4}$ g cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ have been derived in the deep and high photosphere, respectively,
capable of increasing the chromospheric density by a factor of two in about 400
seconds.

the theory of the strong interactions, and discuss how lattice QCD provides a
framework for understanding this phenomenon. A conceptual issue with lattice
QCD is a conflict of space-time lattice with chiral symmetry of quarks. We
discuss how this problem is resolved. Since lattice QCD is a non-linear quantum
dynamical system with infinite degrees of freedom, quantities which are
analytically calculable are limited. On the other hand, it provides an ideal
case of massively parallel numerical computations. We review the long and
distinguished history of parallel-architecture supercomputers designed and
built for lattice QCD. We discuss algorithmic developments, in particular the
difficulties posed by the fermionic nature of quarks, and their resolution. The
triad of efforts toward better understanding of physics, better algorithms, and
more powerful supercomputers have produced major breakthroughs in our
understanding of the strong interactions. We review the salient results of this
effort in understanding the hadron spectrum, the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
matrix elements and CP violation, and quark-gluon plasma at high temperatures.

for prostate and pancreatic tumors. The detector consists in two parts: a PET
head mounted on an ultrasound probe and an external PET plate. The challenging
goal of 1 mm spatial resolution for the PET image requires a detector with
small crystal size, and therefore high channel density: 4096 LYSO crystals
individually readout by Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) make up the external
plate. The quality and properties of these components must be assessed before
the assembly. The dark count rate, gain, breakdown voltage and correlated noise
of the SiPMs are measured, while the LYSO crystals are evaluated in terms of
light yield and energy resolution. In order to effectively reduce the noise in
the PET image, high time resolution for the gamma detection is mandatory. The
Coincidence Time Resolution (CTR) of all the SiPMs assembled with crystals is
measured, and results show a value close to the demanding goal of 200 ps FWHM.
The light output is evaluated for every channel for a preliminary detector
calibration, showing an average of about 1800 pixels fired on the SiPM for a
511 keV interaction. Finally, the average energy resolution at 511 keV is about
13 %, enough for effective Compton rejection.

caused by finiteness of machine arithmetic, can lead to qualitative
discrepancies between phase portraits of the resulting spatially discretized
systems and the original systems. These effects can be modelled on a
multidimensional integer lattice by using a dynamical system obtained by
composing the transition operator of the original system with a quantizer. Such
models manifest pseudorandomness which can be studied using a rigorous
probability theoretic approach. To this end, the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is
endowed with a class of frequency measurable subsets and a spatial frequency
functional as a finitely additive probability measure on them. Using a
multivariate version of Weyl's equidistribution criterion, we introduce an
algebra of frequency measurable quasiperiodic subsets of the lattice. This
approach is applied to quantized linear systems with the transition operator $R
\circ L$, where $L$ is a nonsingular matrix of the original linear system in
$\mathbb{R}^n$, and the map $R$ commutes with the additive group of
translations of the lattice. For almost every $L$, the events associated with
the deviation of trajectories of the quantized and original systems are
frequency measurable quasiperiodic subsets of the lattice whose frequencies
involve geometric probabilities on finite-dimensional tori. Using the skew
products of measure preserving toral automorphisms, we prove mutual
independence and uniform distribution of the quantization errors and
investigate statistical properties of invertibility loss for the quantized
linear system, extending V.V.Voevodin's results. When $L$ is similar to an
orthogonal matrix, we establish a functional central limit theorem for the
deviations of trajectories of the quantized and original systems. These results
are demonstrated for rounded-off planar rotations.

important for understanding enzyme mechanisms as well as designing enzyme
inhibitors. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of a Lagrangian
particle-based method, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), to study
diffusion in biomolecular systems by numerically solving the time-dependent
Smoluchowski equation for continuum diffusion.
  Results. The numerical method is first verified in simple systems and then
applied to the calculation of ligand binding to an acetylcholinesterase
monomer. Unlike previous studies, a reactive Robin boundary condition (BC),
rather than the absolute absorbing (Dirichlet) boundary condition, is
considered on the reactive boundaries. This new boundary condition treatment
allows for the analysis of enzymes with ""imperfect"" reaction rates. Rates for
inhibitor binding to mAChE are calculated at various ionic strengths and
compared with experiment and other numerical methods. We find that imposition
of the Robin BC improves agreement between calculated and experimental reaction
rates.
  Conclusions. Although this initial application focuses on a single monomer
system, our new method provides a framework to explore broader applications of
SPH in larger-scale biomolecular complexes by taking advantage of its
Lagrangian particle-based nature.

tomographic imaging, which will clearly discriminate between different galaxy

the SKA1-LOW baseline design with a 1 km diameter core will resolve HII regions
expected from galaxy formation models which include strong feedback on low-mass
galaxy formation. Imaging the smaller HII regions that result from galaxy
formation in the absence of SNe feedback will also be possible for SKA1-LOW in

dissipation in silica at cryogenic temperatures using fiber-optic structures
that tightly confine both photons and phonons to the fiber-optic core. When
immersed in helium, this fiber system supports nearly perfect guidance of 9 GHz
acoustic phonons; strong electrostrictively mediated photon-phonon coupling (or
guided-wave stimulated Brillouin scattering) permits a flexible form of
laser-based phonon spectroscopy. Through linear and nonlinear phonon
spectroscopy, we isolate the effects of disorder-induced two-level tunneling
states as a source of phononic dissipation in this system. We show that an
ensemble of such two-level tunneling states can be driven into
transparency--virtually eliminating this source of phonon dissipation over a
broad range of frequencies. Experimental studies of phononic self-frequency
saturation show excellent agreement with a theoretical model accounting for the
phonon coupling to an ensemble of two-level tunneling states. Extending these
results, we demonstrate a general approach to suppress dissipation produced by
two-level tunneling states via cross-saturation, where the lifetime of a
phonons at one frequency can be extended by the presence of a high intensity
acoustic beam at another frequency. Although these studies were carried out in

first derive closed-form solutions for classical paths followed by a particle
on the surface of the collapsing star in Schwarzschild and Kruskal coordinates

application of these paths to model the collapse of ultra-light dark matter
particles, which necessitates incorporating quantum effects. To do so we treat
a particle on the surface of the star as a wavepacket and integrate over all
possible paths taken by the particle. The waveform is computed in Schwarzschild
coordinates and found to exhibit an ingoing and an outgoing component, where
the former contains the probability of collapse, while the latter contains the
probability that the star will disperse. These calculations pave the way for
investigating the possibility of quantum collapse that does not lead to black
hole formation as well as for exploring the nature of the wavefunction inside

the distributional derivative of a function that is continuous on the extended

pre-cancellation can be attained in the Gel`fand-Pinsker problem with additive
state and additive white Gaussian noise. This result holds under the
assumptions that full channel knowledge is available at both the transmitter
and the receiver. In this work we consider the scenario in which the state is
multiplied by an ergodic fading process which is not known at the encoder. We
study both the case in which the receiver has knowledge of the fading and the
case in which it does not: for both models we derive inner and outer bounds to
capacity and determine the distance between the two bounds when possible. For
the channel without fading knowledge at either the transmitter or the receiver,
the gap between inner and outer bounds is finite for a class of fading
distributions which includes a number of canonical fading models. In the
capacity approaching strategy for this class, the transmitter performs Costa`s
pre-coding against the mean value of the fading times the state while the
receiver treats the remaining signal as noise. For the case in which only the
receiver has knowledge of the fading, we determine a finite gap between inner
and outer bounds for two classes of discrete fading distribution. The first
class of distributions is the one in which there exists a probability mass
larger than one half while the second class is the one in which the fading is
uniformly distributed over values that are exponentially spaced apart.
Unfortunately, the capacity in the case of a continuous fading distribution
remains very hard to characterize.

Given a set of data
points drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to partition them into
their underlying subspaces they were drawn from. The spectral clustering method
is used as the framework. It requires to find an affinity matrix which is close
to block diagonal, with nonzero entries corresponding to the data point pairs
from the same subspace. In this work, we argue that both sparsity and the
grouping effect are important for subspace segmentation. A sparse affinity
matrix tends to be block diagonal, with less connections between data points
from different subspaces. The grouping effect ensures that the highly corrected
data which are usually from the same subspace can be grouped together. Sparse
Subspace Clustering (SSC), by using $\ell^1$-minimization, encourages sparsity
for data selection, but it lacks of the grouping effect. On the contrary,
Low-Rank Representation (LRR), by rank minimization, and Least Squares
Regression (LSR), by $\ell^2$-regularization, exhibit strong grouping effect,
but they are short in subset selection. Thus the obtained affinity matrix is
usually very sparse by SSC, yet very dense by LRR and LSR.
  In this work, we propose the Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation
(CASS) method by using trace Lasso. CASS is a data correlation dependent method
which simultaneously performs automatic data selection and groups correlated
data together. It can be regarded as a method which adaptively balances SSC and
LSR. Both theoretical and experimental results show the effectiveness of CASS.

'AdS/CFT' duality was introduced, which since has been intensively studied in

that even Newton's law of gravitation can be related holographically to the
`thermodynamics of information' on screens. We discuss these scenarios, with
special attention to the status of the holographic relation in them and to the
question of whether they make gravity and spacetime emergent. We conclude that
only Verlinde's scheme straightfowardly instantiates emergence. However,
assuming a non-standard interpretation of AdS/CFT may create room for the
emergence of spacetime and gravity there as well.

paid to inter-view constraint propagation, which is more challenging since
pairwise constraints are now defined over pairs of data points from different

that they can be efficiently solved based on graph-based label propagation. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to give an efficient
solution to inter-view constraint propagation from a semi-supervised learning

of having one propagating channel and extend theorems from the theory of
one-dimensional Jacobi operators that relate the behavior of transfer matrices
with the spectrum. These theorems are then applied to the considered model. In
essence, in a certain energy region the kinetic part averages the random
potentials along shells and the transfer matrices behave similar as for a
one-dimensional operator with random potential of decaying variance. At $d$
dimensional growth for $d>2$ this effective decay is strong enough to obtain
absolutely continuous spectrum, whereas for some uniform $d$ dimensional growth
with $d<2$ one has pure point spectrum in this energy region. At exactly
uniform $2$ dimensional growth also some singular continuous spectrum appears,
at least at small disorder. As a corollary we also obtain a change from

Firstly, for efficiency purposes, the visual vocabulary is commonly constructed
by directly clustering the low-level visual feature vectors extracted from
local keypoints, without considering the high-level semantics of images. That
is, the visual BOW model still suffers from the semantic gap, and thus may lead
to significant performance degradation in more challenging tasks (e.g. social
image classification). Secondly, typically thousands of visual words are
generated to obtain better performance on a relatively large image dataset. Due
to such large vocabulary size, the subsequent image classification may take
sheer amount of time. To overcome the first drawback, we develop a graph-based
method for visual BOW refinement by exploiting the tags (easy to access
although noisy) of social images. More notably, for efficient image
classification, we further reduce the refined visual BOW model to a much
smaller size through semantic spectral clustering. Extensive experimental
results show the promising performance of the proposed framework for visual BOW
refinement and reduction.

steadily on the Internet, nowadays more and more service consumers pay great
attention to the non-functional properties of Web services, also known as
quality of service (QoS), when finding and selecting appropriate Web services.
For most of the QoS-aware Web service recommendation systems, the list of
recommended Web services is generally obtained based on a rating-oriented
prediction approach, aiming at predicting the potential ratings that an active
user may assign to the unrated services as accurately as possible. However, in
some application scenarios, high accuracy of rating prediction may not
necessarily lead to a satisfactory recommendation result. In this paper, we
propose a ranking-oriented hybrid approach by combining the item-based
collaborative filtering and latent factor models to address the problem of Web
services ranking. In particular, the similarity between two Web services is
measured in terms of the correlation coefficient between their rankings instead
of between the traditional QoS ratings. Besides, we also improve the measure
NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) for evaluating the accuracy of the
top K recommendations returned in ranked order. Comprehensive experiments on
the QoS data set composed of real-world Web services are conducted to test our
approach, and the experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms other competing approaches.

requires the consideration of the finite size of a body and is reduced to the

typically flexoelectric moduli are very small, usually one can consider the
solution of polarization equilibrium equations at a given elastic strain
(direct flexoelectric effect) or the solution of elastic equilibrium equations

valued random element $X$ are rigorously established and discussed. In
particular, given the first $d$ principal components (PCs) and as the radius
$\varepsilon$ of the ball tends to zero, the SmBP is asymptotically
proportional to (a) the joint density of the first $d$ PCs, (b) the volume of
the $d$-dimensional ball with radius $\varepsilon$, and (c) a correction factor
weighting the use of a truncated version of the process expansion. Moreover,
under suitable assumptions on the spectrum of the covariance operator of $X$
and as $d$ diverges to infinity when $\varepsilon$ vanishes, some
simplifications occur. In particular, the SmBP factorizes asymptotically as the
product of the joint density of the first $d$ PCs and a pure volume parameter.
All the provided factorizations allow to define a surrogate intensity of the
SmBP that, in some cases, leads to a genuine intensity. To operationalize the
stated results, a non-parametric estimator for the surrogate intensity is
introduced and it is proved that the use of estimated PCs, instead of the true

the required number of users for OIA with 1-bit feedback remains the same as
with real-valued feedback. For a given system configuration, we provide an
optimal choice of the 1-bit quantizer, which captures most of the capacity
provided by a system with real-valued feedback. Using our new 1-bit feedback
scheme for OIA, we compare OIA with IA and show that OIA has a much lower
complexity and provides a better rate in the practical operation region of a
cellular communication system.

extensions of the notion of an automatic group to graph automatic by
Kharlampovich, Khoussainov and Miasnikov and then to C-graph automatic by the
authors, a compelling question is whether F is graph automatic or C-graph
automatic for an appropriate language class C. The extended definitions allow
the use of a symbol alphabet for the normal form language, replacing the
dependence on generating set. In this paper we construct a 1-counter graph
automatic structure for F based on the standard infinite normal form for group
elements.

consider the contributions of the vacuum condensates up to dimension $7$ in the

$G_{Ds*Ds\phi}=4.12\pm0.70 GeV^{-1}$. The results of this work are very useful
