breakthrough with the birth of a new branch called spintronics. This
discipline, while still young, exploits the spin of electrons. Most quantum
devices exploiting this property of electrons consists of alternating magnetic
and nonmagnetic thin layers on a semiconductor substrate. One of the best tools
used for characterizing these structures is the so-called Ballistic Electron
Emission Microscope (BEEM). Originally, it was dedicated to the imaging of
buried objects and to the study of the potential barrier formed at the
interface of a metal and a semiconductor. With the development of spintronics,
the BEEM became an essential spectroscopy technique but still fundamentally
misunderstood. The first realistic model, based on the non-equilibrium Keldysh
formalism, was proposed to describe the transport of electrons during BEEM
experiments. However, despite its success, its use was limited to the study of
semi-infinite structures through a calculation method called decimation of
Green functions. In this context, we have extended this model to the case of
thin films and hetero-structures like spinvalves: starting from the same
postulate that electrons follow the band structure of materials in which they
propagate, we have established an iterative formula allowing calculation of the
Green functions of the finite system by tight-binding method and encoded it in
a F90 code. In parallel, we have developed a simpler method which allows to
avoid passing through the non-equilibrium Keldysh formalism. Despite its
simplicity, we have shown that this intuitive approach gives some physical
interpretation qualitatively similar to the non-equilibrium approach. However,
for a more detailed study, the use of ""non-equilibrium approach"" is inevitable,
especially for the detection of thickness effects linked to layer interfaces.

decision boundaries because of the kernel-trick. This expressiveness comes at a
price: During test-time, the SVM classifier needs to compute the kernel
inner-product between a test sample and all support vectors. With large
training data sets, the time required for this computation can be substantial.
In this paper, we introduce a post-processing algorithm, which compresses the
learned SVM model by reducing and optimizing support vectors. We evaluate our
algorithm on several medium-scaled real-world data sets, demonstrating that it
maintains high test accuracy while reducing the test-time evaluation cost by
several orders of magnitude---in some cases from hours to seconds. It is fair
to say that most of the work in this paper was previously been invented by
Burges and Sch\""olkopf almost 20 years ago. For most of the time during which

event triggers. For IoTH, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) - a subset of the recent
Bluetooth v4.0 stack - provides a low-power and loosely coupled mechanism for
sensor data collection with ubiquitous units (e.g., smartphones and tablets)
carried by humans. This fundamental design paradigm of BLE is enabled by a
range of broadcast advertising modes. While its operational benefits are
numerous, the lack of a common time reference in the broadcast mode of BLE has
been a fundamental limitation. This paper presents and describes CheepSync: a
time synchronization service for BLE advertisers, especially tailored for
applications requiring high time precision on resource constrained BLE
platforms. Designed on top of the existing Bluetooth v4.0 standard, the
CheepSync framework utilizes low-level timestamping and comprehensive error
compensation mechanisms for overcoming uncertainties in message transmission,
clock drift and other system specific constraints. CheepSync was implemented on
custom designed nRF24Cheep beacon platforms (as broadcasters) and commercial
off-the-shelf Android ported smartphones (as passive listeners). We demonstrate
the efficacy of CheepSync by numerous empirical evaluations in a variety of

${\rm CS}(7$--$6)$ emission lines to reveal the spatial distribution of the

the $^{13}$CO(3-2) and the CS(7-8) molecular emissions, which show smaller
radii than the CO(3-2) detection. The continuum observations at 850$\mu$m allow
the spatial resolution of the dusty disk, which shows two emission bumps
separated by $\sim$40AU, consistent with the presence of a dust gap in the
inner regions of the disk, and an outer radius of $\sim$80AU. Therefore, T Cha
is surrounded by a compact dusty disk and a larger and more diffuse gaseous
disk, as previously observed in other young stars. The continuum intensity
profiles are different at both sides of the disk suggesting possible dust
asymmetries. We derive an inclination of i(deg)=67$\pm$5, and a position angle
of PA (deg)= 113$\pm$6, for both the gas and dust disks. The comparison of the
ALMA data with radiative transfer models shows that the gas and dust components
can only be simultaneously reproduced when we include a tapered edge
prescription for the surface density profile. The best model suggests that most
of the disk mass is placed within a radius of $R<$ 50AU. Finally, we derive a
dynamical mass for the central object of $M_{*}$=1.5$\pm$0.2M$_{\odot}$,
comparable to the one estimated with evolutionary models for an age of

pulsation maxima alternate between two levels in a way that is characteristic
of period-doubling. In addition, hydrocode models of these stars have clearly
demonstrated period-doubling bifurcations. As a result, it is now generally
accepted that these stars do indeed exhibit period-doubling. Here we present
strong evidence that this assumption is incorrect. The alternating maxima
likely result from the presence of one or more near-resonant modes which appear
in the stellar spectra and are slightly but significantly offset from 3/2 times
the fundamental frequency. We show that a previously proposed explanation for
the presence of these peaks is inadequate. The phase-slip of the dominant
near-resonant peak in RR Lyr is shown to be fully correlated with the parity of
the observed alternations, providing further strong evidence that the process
is nonresonant and cannot be characterized as period-doubling. The dominant
near-resonant peak in V808 Cyg has side-peaks spaced at twice the Blazhko
frequency. This apparent modulation indicates that the peak corresponds to a
vibrational mode and also adds strong support to the beating-modes model of the
Blazhko effect which can account for the doubled frequency. The modulation also
demonstrates the ""environment"" altering effect of large amplitude modes which
is shown to be consistent with the amplitude equation formalism.

quantitatively estimated the impact of the spontaneous polarization (SP) of the
SiC(0001) substrate on the electronic properties of quasi-freestanding graphene
(QFG) decoupled from the SiC by H intercalation. To correctly include within
standard DFT slab calculations the influence of the SP, which is a bulk
property, on a surface confined property such as the graphene's doping, we
attach a double gold layer at the C-terminated bottom of the slab which
introduces a metal induced gap state that pins the chemical potential within
the gap. Furthermore, expanding the interlayer distances at the bottom of the
slab creates a local dipole moment which counters that arising from the slab's
polar character and allows to align the location of the graphene's Dirac point
(DP) for cubic SiC(111) with the chemical potential. Thus, the DP shifts
obtained for other polytypes under the same slab model become an almost direct
measurement of the SP-induced doping. Our results confirm the recent proposal
that the SP induces the experimentally observed p-type doping in the graphene
layer which can achieve DP shifts of up to several hundreds of meV (or
equivalently, $\sim 10^{13} e$/cm$^2$) for specific polytypes. The doping is
found to increase with the hexagonality of the polytype and its thickness. For
the slab thickensses considered (6-12 SiC bilayers) an ample, almost
continuous, range of doping values can be achieved by tuning the number of
stacking defects and their location with respect to the surface. The slab model
is next generalized by performing large scale DFT calculations where
self-doping is included in the QFG via point defects (vacancy plus a H atom)
thus allowing to estimate the interplay between both sources of p-doping (SP-
versus defect-induced) which turns out to be essentially additive.

systems and C*-correspondences. We provide a full comparison amongst the
related operator algebras. For our analysis we isolate a partially defined
dynamical system, to which we refer as the {\em quantised dynamics} of the
monomial ideal.
  In addition we revisit several previously considered constructions. These
include Matsumoto's subshift C*-algebras, as well as the tensor and the Pimsner
algebras associated with dynamical systems or graphs. We sort out the various
relations by giving concrete conditions and counterexamples that orientate the
operator algebras of our context.
  It appears that the boundary C*-algebras do not arise as the quotient with
the compact operators unconditionally. We establish a dichotomy to this effect
by examining the resulting tensor algebras. We identify their boundary
representations, we analyse their C*-envelopes, and we give criteria for
hyperrigidity. Moreover we completely classify them in terms of the data
provided by the monomial ideals. For tensor algebras of C*-correspondences and
bounded isomorphisms this is achieved up to the level of local conjugacy (in
the sense of Davidson and Roydor) for the quantised dynamics. For tensor
algebras of subproduct systems and algebraic isomorphisms this is achieved up
to the level of equality of monomial ideals modulo permutations of the
variables.
  In the process we accomplish more in different directions. Most notably we
show that tensor algebras form a complete invariant for isomorphic (resp.
similar) subproduct systems of homogeneous ideals up to isometric (resp.
bounded) isomorphisms.
  The results on local conjugacy are obtained via an alternative proof of the
breakthrough result of Davidson and Katsoulis on piecewise conjugate systems.
For our purposes we use appropriate compressions of the Fock representation. We
then apply this alternative proof locally for the partially defined quantised
dynamics. In this way we avoid the topological graphs machinery and pave the
way for further applications. These include operator algebras of dynamical
systems over commuting contractions or over row commuting contractions.

appropriate tool to suppress undesired proton decay operators and various
flavour violating interactions, to generate a hierarchical fermion mass
spectrum, etc. In F-theory, GUT symmetries are linked to the singularities of
the elliptically fibred K3 manifolds; they are of ADE type and have been
extensively discussed in recent literature. In this context, abelian and
discrete symmetries usually arise either as a subgroup of the non-abelian
symmetry or from a non-trivial Mordell-Weil group associated to rational
sections of the elliptic fibration. In this note we give a short overview of
the current status and focus in models with rank-one Mordell-Weil group.

zero magnetic field associated with the weak antilocalization (WAL) effect and
a linear MR effect which generally persists to high fields and high
temperatures. We have studied the MR of topological insulator Bi2Te3 films from
the metallic to semiconducting transport regime. While in metallic samples, the
WAL is difficult to identify due to the smallness of the WAL compared to the
samples' conductivity, the sharp WAL dip in the MR is clearly present in the
samples with higher resistivity. To correctly account for the low field MR by
the quantitative theory of WAL according to the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN)

the WAL quantum correction. Otherwise the WAL fitting alone yields an
unrealistically large coefficient $\alpha$ in the HLN analysis.

carried out using the Anelastic Spherical Harmonic (ASH) code, that are
designed to isolate those processes that drive and shape meridional
circulations within stellar convection zones. These simulations have been
constructed so as to span the transition between solar-like differential
rotation (fast equator/slow poles) and ``anti-solar' differential rotation
(slow equator/fast poles). Solar-like states of differential rotation, arising
when convection is rotationally constrained, are characterized by a very
different convective Reynolds stress than anti-solar regimes, wherein
convection only weakly senses the Coriolis force. We find that the angular
momentum transport by convective Reynolds stress plays a central role in
establishing the meridional flow profiles in these simulations. We find that
the transition from single-celled to multi-celled meridional circulation
profiles in strong and weak regimes of rotational constraint is linked to a
change in the convective Reynolds stress, a clear demonstration of gyroscopic
pumping. Latitudinal thermal variations differ between these different regimes,
with those in the solar-like regime conspiring to suppress a single cell of
meridional circulation, whereas the cool poles and warm equator established in
the anti-solar states tend to promote single-celled circulations. Though the
convective angular momentum transport becomes radially inward at mid-latitudes
in anti-solar regimes, it is the meridional circulation that is primarily
responsible for establishing a rapidly-rotating pole. We conclude with a
discussion of how these results relate to the Sun, and suggest that the Sun may
lie near the transition between rapidly-rotating and slowly-rotating regimes.

stochastic processes, is most commonly estimated via linear autoregressive
modeling. However, this approach has a serious drawback: if the process being
modeled has a moving average component, then the autoregressive model order is
theoretically infinite, and in finite sample large empirical model orders may
be necessary, resulting in weak Granger-causal inference. This is particularly
relevant when the process has been filtered, downsampled, or observed with
(additive) noise - all of which induce a moving average component and are
commonplace in application domains as diverse as econometrics and the
neurosciences. By contrast, the class of autoregressive moving average models -
or, equivalently, linear state space models - is closed under digital
filtering, downsampling (and other forms of aggregation) as well as additive
observational noise. Here, we show how Granger causality, conditional and
unconditional, in both time and frequency domains, may be calculated simply and
directly from state space model parameters, via solution of a discrete
algebraic Riccati equation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that Granger
causality estimators thus derived have greater statistical power and smaller
bias than pure autoregressive estimators. We conclude that the state space
approach should be the default for (linear) Granger causality estimation.

allows for a strong redistribution of electronic densities up to a complete
charge segregation when all carriers occupy, with the maximum filling, a
fraction $\nu$ of the chain length - thus forming the integer quantum Hall
state, while leaving the fraction $(1-\nu)$ of the chain length unoccupied. The
electric field in charged regions easily exceeds the pinning threshold of the
CDW, then the depinning propagates into the nominally pinned central region via
sharp domain walls. Resulting picture is that of compensated collective and
normal pulsing counter-currents driven by the Hall voltage. This scenario is
illustrated by numerical modeling for nonstationary distributions of the
current and the electric field. This picture can interpret experiments in
mesa-junctions showing depinning by the Hall voltage and the generation of

past operations. The organization of data is referred to as the data
structure's state, and the sequence of past operations constitutes the data
structure's history. A data structure state can therefore be used as an oracle
to derive information about its history. As a result, for history-sensitive
applications, such as privacy in e-voting, incremental signature schemes, and
regulatory compliant data retention; it is imperative to conceal historical
information contained within data structure states.
  Data structure history can be hidden by making data structures history
independent. In this paper, we explore how to achieve history independence.
  We observe that current history independence notions are significantly
limited in number and scope. There are two existing notions of history
independence -- weak history independence (WHI) and strong history independence
(SHI). WHI does not protect against insider adversaries and SHI mandates
canonical representations, resulting in inefficiency.
  We postulate the need for a broad, encompassing notion of history
independence, which can capture WHI, SHI, and a broad spectrum of new history
independence notions. To this end, we introduce $\Delta$history independence
($\Delta$HI), a generic game-based framework that is malleable enough to
accommodate existing and new history independence notions.
  As an essential step towards formalizing $\Delta$HI, we explore the concepts
of abstract data types, data structures, machine models, memory representations
and history independence. Finally, to bridge the gap between theory and
practice, we outline a general recipe for building end-to-end, history
independent systems and demonstrate the use of the recipe in designing two
history independent file systems.

The Dy-RDy mechanism is derived via Hall magnetohydrodynamics, which unifies
the evolution of magnetic field and fluid vorticity. It also introduces an
intrinsic length scale, the ion skin depth, allowing for the proper
normalization and categorization of microscopic and macroscopic scales. The
large scale Alfv\'en Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{A}$, defining the relative
""abundance"" of the flow field to the magnetic field is shown to be tied to a
microscopic scale length that reflects the characteristics of the ambient short
scale reservoir. The dynamo (Dy), preferentially producing the large scale
magnetic field, is the dominant mode when the ambient turbulence is mostly
kinetic, while the outflow producing reverse dynamo (RDy) is the principal
manifestation of a magnetically dominated turbulent reservoir. It is
conjectured that an efficient RDy may be the source of many observed
astrophysical outflows that have $\mathcal{M}_{A} \gg 1$.

important 3-dimensional topological configurations existing in QCD, which are
believed to produce colour confinement. Instantons are 4-dimensional
topological configurations and are known to be related to chiral symmetry
breaking. To study the relation between monopoles and instantons we generate
configurations adding to the vacuum state static monopole-antimonopole pairs of
opposite charges by use of a monopole creation operator. We observe that the
monopole creation operator only adds long monopole loops to the configurations.
We then count the number of fermion zero modes using Overlap fermions as a
tool. As a result we find that each monopole-antimonopole pair of magnetic
charge one adds one zero mode of chirality $\pm1$, i.e. one instanton of
topological charge $\pm1$.

microlensing, there are two cases of a star with two planets, and two cases of
a binary star with a planet. Other, yet undetected types of triple lenses
include triple stars or stars with a planet with a moon. The analysis and
interpretation of such events is hindered by the lack of understanding of
essential characteristics of triple lenses, such as their critical curves and
caustics. We present here analytical and numerical methods for mapping the
critical-curve topology and caustic cusp number in the parameter space of
$n$-point-mass lenses. We apply the methods to the analysis of four symmetric
triple-lens models, and obtain altogether 9 different critical-curve topologies
and 32 caustic structures. While these results include various generic types,
they represent just a subset of all possible triple-lens critical curves and
caustics. Using the analyzed models, we demonstrate interesting features of
triple lenses that do not occur in two-point-mass lenses. We show an example of
a lens that cannot be described by the Chang-Refsdal model in the wide limit.
In the close limit we demonstrate unusual structures of primary and secondary
caustic loops, and explain the conditions for their occurrence. In the
planetary limit we find that the presence of a planet may lead to a whole
sequence of additional caustic metamorphoses. We show that a pair of planets
may change the structure of the primary caustic even when placed far from their
resonant position at the Einstein radius.

is chosen uniformly at random) from an unknown $n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3$
tensor $T$. We assume that $T$ is entry-wise close to being rank $r$. Our goal
is to fill in its missing entries using as few observations as possible. Let $n
= \max(n_1, n_2, n_3)$. We show that if $m = n^{3/2} r$ then there is a
polynomial time algorithm based on the sixth level of the sum-of-squares
hierarchy for completing it. Our estimate agrees with almost all of $T$'s
entries almost exactly and works even when our observations are corrupted by
noise. This is also the first algorithm for tensor completion that works in the
overcomplete case when $r > n$, and in fact it works all the way up to $r =
n^{3/2-\epsilon}$.
  Our proofs are short and simple and are based on establishing a new
connection between noisy tensor completion (through the language of Rademacher
complexity) and the task of refuting random constant satisfaction problems.
This connection seems to have gone unnoticed even in the context of matrix
completion. Furthermore, we use this connection to show matching lower bounds.
Our main technical result is in characterizing the Rademacher complexity of the
sequence of norms that arise in the sum-of-squares relaxations to the tensor
nuclear norm. These results point to an interesting new direction: Can we
explore computational vs. sample complexity tradeoffs through the
sum-of-squares hierarchy?

Augustin, Mugglestone and Buckland (J. Appl. Ecol., 1996, 33, 339) analysed red
deer census data using a hybrid estimation approach, combining maximum
pseudo-likelihood estimation with Gibbs sampling of missing data. However
Dormann (Ecol. Model., 2007, 207, 234) questioned the validity of auto-logistic
regression, giving examples of apparent underestimation of covariate parameters
in analysis of simulated ""snouter"" data. Dormann et al. (Ecography, 2007, 30,
609) extended this analysis to auto-Poisson and auto-normal models, reporting
similar anomalies. All the above studies employ neighbourhood weighting schemes
inconsistent with conditions (Besag, J. R. Stat. Soc., Ser. B, 1974, 36, 192)
required for auto-model validity; furthermore the auto-Poisson analysis fails
to exclude cooperative interactions. We show that all ""snouter"" anomalies are
resolved by correct auto-model implementation. Re-analysis of the red deer data
shows that invalid neighbourhood weightings generate only small estimation
errors for the full dataset, but larger errors occur on geographic subsamples.
A substantial fraction of papers applying auto-logistic regression to
ecological data use these invalid weightings, which are default options in the
widely used ""spdep"" spatial dependence package for R. Auto-logistic analyses
using invalid neighbourhood weightings will be erroneous to an extent that can
vary widely. These analyses can easily be corrected by using valid
neighbourhood weightings available in ""spdep"". The hybrid estimation approach
for missing data is readily adapted for valid neighbourhood weighting schemes
and is implemented here in R for application to sparse presence-absence data.

due to violation of conditions (Besag, J. R. Stat. Soc., Ser. B, 1974, 36, 192)
for auto-model validity. Here we show that after correcting these technical
errors, a more fundamental conceptual error remains: the comparative studies
are founded on a mathematically incorrect notion of bias, involving direct
comparison of parameter estimates across models differing in mathematical
structure. We develop a set of simulation-based measures of covariate influence
that are directly comparable across models and apply them to examples from the
abovementioned studies. We find that in these cases, the effect of auto-model
parameters is similar to (and consistent with) corresponding linear model
effects, due to a phenomenon within auto-models that we refer to as ""covariate
amplification"". Thus, simple comparison of parameter magnitudes between
structurally different models can be highly misleading. We demonstrate that the
recent critique of auto-models is entirely unfounded. Correctly applied and
interpreted, autocovariate regression provides a practical approach to
inference for spatially autocorrelated species distribution or abundance data,
while overcoming well-known limitations of generalized linear models.

description of the space of linear collision maps satisfying energy and (linear
and angular) momentum conservation, time reversibility, and the natural
requirement that impulse forces only act at the point of contact of the
colliding bodies. These assumptions can be stated in geometric language by
making explicit a family of vector subbundles of the tangent bundle to the
boundary of $M$: the diagonal, non-slipping, and impulse subbundles. Collision
maps at a boundary configuration are shown to be the isometric involutions that
restrict to the identity on the non-slipping subspace. The space of such maps

microscopy (STM) experiments based on large scale simulations. The key quantity
is the relative brightness correlation of constant-current topographs between
experimental and simulated data. This correlation can be analyzed statistically
for a large number of modeled tip orientations and geometries. Assuming a
stable tip during the STM scans and based on the correlation distribution, it
is possible to determine the tip orientations that are most likely present in
an STM experiment, and exclude other orientations. This is especially important
for substrates such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) since its STM
contrast is strongly tip dependent, which makes interpretation and comparison
of STM images very challenging. We illustrate the applicability of our method
considering the HOPG surface in combination with tungsten tip models of two
different apex geometries and 18144 different orientations. We calculate
constant-current profiles along the $<1\bar{1}00>$ direction of the HOPG(0001)

experimental data. We find that a blunt tip model provides better correlation
with the experiment for a wider range of tip orientations and bias voltages

accuracy. The theoretical prediction of this value is very sensitive to the
proton-finite-size effects. The proton radius extracted from muonic hydrogen is
in contradiction with the results extracted from elastic electron-proton
scattering. That creates a certain problem for the interpretation of the
results from the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift. For the latter we need also to
take into account the two-photon-exchange contribution with the proton finite
size involved. The only way to describe it relies on the data from the
scattering, which may produce an internal inconsistency of theory.
  Recently the leading proton-finite-size contribution to the two-photon
exchange was found within the external field approximation. The recoil part of
the two-photon-exchange has not been considered. Here we revisit calculation of
the external-field part and take the recoil correction to the finite-size
effects into account.

dark or baryonic matter. We use a variational approach for relativistic fluids
to realize an effective description of matter fields at the Lagrangian level.
The coupling is introduced directly in the action by considering a single
function mixing the dynamical degrees of freedom of the theory. The resulting
gravitational field equations are derived by variations with respect to the
independent variables. New interesting phenomenology can be obtained at both
small scales, where new screening mechanisms for scalar fields can be realized,
and large scales, where one finds an original and rich class of interacting
quintessence models. The background cosmology of two of these models is studied
in detail using dynamical system techniques. We find a variety of interesting
results: for instance, these models contain dark energy dominated late time
attractors and scaling solutions, both with early time matter dominated epochs
and a possible inflationary origin. In general this new approach provides the
starting point for future in depth studies on new interacting quintessence
models.

development of renewable energies, Martinique Island (Lesser Antilles, France)
has been extensively investigated (from 2012 to 2013) through an integrated
multi-methods approach, with the aim to define precisely the potential
geothermal ressources, previously highlighted (Sanjuan et al., 2003). Amongst
the common investigation methods deployed, we carried out three magnetotelluric
(MT) surveys located above three of the most promising geothermal fields of
Martinique, namely the Anses d'Arlet, the Montagne Pel{\'e}e and the Pitons du
Carbet prospects. A total of about 100 MT stations were acquired showing single
or multi-dimensional behaviors and static shift effects. After processing data
with remote reference, 3-D MT inversions of the four complex elements of MT
impedance tensor without pre-static-shift correction, have been performed for
each sector, providing three 3-D resistivity models down to about 12 to 30 km
depth. The sea coast effect has been taken into account in the 3-D inversion
through generation of a 3-D resistivity model including the bathymetry around
Martinique from the coast up to a distance of 200 km. The forward response of
the model is used to calculate coast effect coefficients that are applied to
the calculated MT response during the 3-D inversion process for comparison with
the observed data. 3-D resistivity models of each sector, which are inherited
from different geological history, show 3-D resistivity distribution and
specificities related to its volcanological history. In particular, the
geothermal field related to the Montagne Pel{\'e}e strato-volcano, is
characterized by a quasi ubiquitous conductive layer and quite monotonic
typical resistivity distribution making interpretation difficult in terms of
geothermal targets. At the opposite, the resistivity distribution of Anse
d'Arlet area is radically different and geothermal target is thought to be
connected to a not so deep resistive intrusion elongated along a main
structural axis. Beside these interesting deep structures, we demonstrate,
after analyzing the results of the recent heliborne TEM survey covering the
whole Martinique, that surface resistivity distribution obtained from 3-D
inversion reproduce faithfully the resistivity distribution observed by TEM. In
spite of a very different sampling scale, this comparison illustrates the
ability of 3-D MT inversion to take into account and reproduce static shift
effects in the sub-surface resistivity distribution.

analysed theoretically by two alternative approaches. The first method is based
on tracking the grating transmission for two orthogonal states of linear
polarized light that are extracted from the measured Jones matrix or Stokes
vectors of the TFBG transmission spectra. The second method is based on the
measurements along the system principle axes and polarization dependent loss
(PDL) parameter, also calculated from measured data. It is shown that the
frequent crossing of the Jones matrix eigenvalues as a function of wavelength
leads to a non-physical interchange of the calculated principal axes; a method
to remove this unwanted mathematical artefact and to restore the order of the
system eigenvalues and the corresponding principal axes is provided. A
comparison of the two approaches reveals that the PDL method provides a smaller
standard deviation and therefore lower limit of detection in refractometric
sensing. Furthermore, the polarization analysis of the measured spectra allows
for the identification of the principal states of polarization of the sensor
system and consequentially for the calculation of the transmission spectrum for
any incident polarization state. The stability of the orientation of the system
principal axes is also investigated as a function of wavelength.

adjustment dynamics are driven only by reinforcement feedbacks from each

introduce the concept of k-strong equilibria, which nest both the Nash

we therefore call this X-ray source XB135. XB135 is a low mass X-ray binary
(LMXB) that apparently exhibited hard state characteristics at 0.3--10 keV
luminosities 4--6 E+38 erg/s, and the hard state is only observed below ~10%
Eddington. If true, the accretor would be a high mass black hole (BH) (> ~50

star, and the very low metalicity of B135 (0.015 Z_Sun) makes such a scenario
plausible. We have obtained new XMM-Newton and Chandra HRC observations to shed
light on the nature of this object. We find from the HRC observation that XB135
is a single point source located close to the center of B135. The new
XMM-Newton spectrum is consistent with a rapidly spinning ~10--20 M_Sun BH in
the steep power law or thermal dominant state, but inconsistent with the hard
state that we previously assumed. We cannot formally reject three component
emission models that have been associated with high luminosity neutron star

problems in data analytics, and hence matrix sketching is a critical task.
Although much research has focused on improving the error/size tradeoff under
various sketching paradigms, the many forms of error bounds make these
approaches hard to compare in theory and in practice. This paper attempts to
categorize and compare most known methods under row-wise streaming updates with
provable guarantees, and then to tweak some of these methods to gain practical
improvements while retaining guarantees.
  For instance, we observe that a simple heuristic iSVD, with no guarantees,
tends to outperform all known approaches in terms of size/error trade-off. We
modify the best performing method with guarantees FrequentDirections under the
size/error trade-off to match the performance of iSVD and retain its
guarantees. We also demonstrate some adversarial datasets where iSVD performs
quite poorly. In comparing techniques in the time/error trade-off, techniques
based on hashing or sampling tend to perform better. In this setting we modify
the most studied sampling regime to retain error guarantee but obtain dramatic
improvements in the time/error trade-off.
  Finally, we provide easy replication of our studies on APT, a new testbed
which makes available not only code and datasets, but also a computing platform

changes, which include first the reversible dissociation of lateral bonds
followed by irreversible dissociation of the longitudinal bonds. We have
determined the free energies of dissociation of the lateral (6.9+/-0.4

magneto-hydrodynamical explosion models with a wide range of parameters for
initial rotation and magnetic fields. The explosion models are classified in
two different types: i.e., prompt-magnetic-jet and delayed-magnetic-jet, for
which the magnetic fields of proto-neutron stars (PNSs) during collapse and the
core-bounce are strong and comparatively moderate, respectively. Following the
hydrodynamical trajectories of each explosion model, we confirmed that
r-processes successfully occur in the prompt-magnetic-jets, which produce heavy
nuclei including actinides. On the other hand, the r-process in the
delayed-magnetic-jet is suppressed, which synthesizes only nuclei up to the
second peak ($A \sim 130$). Thus, the r-process in the delayed-magnetic-jets
could explain only ""weak r-process"" patterns observed in metal-poor stars
rather than the ""main r-process"", represented by the solar abundances. Our
results imply that core-collapse supernovae are possible astronomical sources
of heavy r-process elements if their magnetic fields are strong enough, while
weaker magnetic explosions may produce ""weak r-process"" patterns ($A \lesssim

supernovae for explaining the galactic chemical evolution, as well as
abundances of r-process enhanced metal-poor stars. We also examine the effects
of the remaining uncertainties in the nature of PNSs due to weak interactions
that determine the final neutron-richness of ejecta. Additionally, we briefly

systems. With a 60 year-old history, superradiance has played a prominent role
in optics, quantum mechanics and especially in relativity and astrophysics. In
General Relativity, black-hole superradiance is permitted by the ergoregion,
that allows for energy, charge and angular momentum extraction from the vacuum,
even at the classical level. Stability of the spacetime is enforced by the
event horizon, where negative energy-states are dumped. Black-hole
superradiance is intimately connected to the black-hole area theorem, Penrose
process, tidal forces, and even Hawking radiation, which can be interpreted as
a quantum version of black-hole superradiance. Various mechanisms (as diverse
as massive fields, magnetic fields, anti-de Sitter boundaries, nonlinear
interactions, etc...) can confine the amplified radiation and give rise to
strong instabilities. These ""black-hole bombs"" have applications in searches of
dark matter and of physics beyond the Standard Model, are associated to the
threshold of formation of new black hole solutions that evade the no-hair
theorems, can be studied in the laboratory by devising analog models of
gravity, and might even provide a holographic description of spontaneous
symmetry breaking and superfluidity through the gauge-gravity duality.

self-consistent, multi-band model of nearby well-observed supernovae, we find
that the covariances of these quantities are strong and that the confidence
ellipsoids are oriented in the direction of the correlations, which reduces
their significance. By proper treatment of the covariance matrix of the model,
we discover a significant intrinsic width to the correlations between $L_{\rm

distance and the extinction dominate. For fixed $E_{\rm exp}$, the spread in

of the Type II-Plateau supernova light curves leads to inherently degenerate
estimates of $E_{\rm exp}$ and $M_{\rm ej}$, which makes their observed
correlation weak. Ignoring the covariances of supernova parameters or the

two different EoR scenarios, one with a single population of galaxies (with a
mass-independent ionizing efficiency) and a second, more general model with two
different, feedback-regulated populations (each with mass-dependent ionizing
efficiencies). As an example, combining three observations (z=8, 9 and 10) of
the 21 cm power spectrum with a conservative noise estimate and uniform model
priors, we find that interferometers with specifications like the Low Frequency
Array/Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA)/Square Kilometre Array 1
(SKA1) can constrain common reionization parameters: the ionizing efficiency
(or similarly the escape fraction), the mean free path of ionizing photons and
the log of the minimum virial temperature of star-forming haloes to within
45.3/22.0/16.7, 33.5/18.4/17.8 and 6.3/3.3/2.4 per cent, ~$1\sigma$ fractional
uncertainty, respectively. Instead, if we optimistically assume that we can
perfectly characterize the EoR modelling uncertainties, we can improve on these
constraints by up to a factor of ~few. Similarly, the fractional uncertainty on
the average neutral fraction can be constrained to within $\lesssim10$ per cent
for HERA and SKA1. By studying the resulting impact on astrophysical
constraints, 21CMMC can be used to optimize (i) interferometer designs; (ii)
foreground cleaning algorithms; (iii) observing strategies; (iv) alternative
statistics characterizing the 21 cm signal; and (v) synergies with other
observational programs.

electrically charged static distorted black hole. The duality transformation is
directly related to the discrete symmetry of the space-time. The black hole
horizons area, surface gravity, and angular momentum satisfy the Smarr formula
constructed for both the horizons. We formulate the zeroth, the first, and the
second laws of black hole thermodynamics for both the horizons of the black

first law. The Smarr formula and the laws of thermodynamics formulated for both
the horizons are related by the duality transformation. The distortion is
illustrated on the example of a quadrupole and octupole fields. The distortion
fields noticeably affect the proper time of a free fall from the outer to the
inner horizon of the black hole along the symmetry semi-axes. There is some
minimal non-zero value of the quadrupole and octupole moments when the time

using additional data find that all sources are most likely at low redshift. We
also find five X-ray sources without a counterpart in the optical or infrared

dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB), whose implications are
extraordinary. This contribution describes how DCSB, not the Higgs boson,
generates more than 98% of the visible mass in the Universe, explains why
confinement guarantees that condensates, those quantities that were commonly
viewed as constant mass-scales that fill all spacetime, are instead wholly
contained within hadrons, and elucidates a range of observable consequences of
confinement and DCSB whose measurement is the focus of a vast international

diffusion network, can we identify the source node that originally introduced
the piece into the network and infer the time when it initiated this? Being
able to do so is critical for curtailing the spread of malicious information,
and reducing the potential losses incurred. This is a very challenging problem
since typically only incomplete traces are observed and we need to unroll the
incomplete traces into the past in order to pinpoint the source. In this paper,
we tackle this problem by developing a two-stage framework, which first learns
a continuous-time diffusion network model based on historical diffusion traces
and then identifies the source of an incomplete diffusion trace by maximizing
the likelihood of the trace under the learned model. Experiments on both large
synthetic and real-world data show that our framework can effectively go back
to the past, and pinpoint the source node and its initiation time significantly
more accurately than previous state-of-the-arts.

radiative-transfer simulations of a Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation model
which synthesizes 0.51 Msun of 56Ni, and confront our results to the Type Ia
supernova (SN Ia) 2002bo over the first 100 days of its evolution. Assuming
only homologous expansion, this same model reproduces the bolometric and
multi-band light curves, the secondary near-infrared (NIR) maxima, and the
optical and NIR spectra. The chemical stratification of our model qualitatively
agrees with previous inferences by Stehle et al., but reveals significant
quantitative differences for both iron-group and intermediate-mass elements. We
show that +/-0.1 Msun (i.e., +/-20 per cent) variations in 56Ni mass have a
modest impact on the bolometric and colour evolution of our model. One notable
exception is the U-band, where a larger abundance of iron-group elements
results in less opaque ejecta through ionization effects, our model with more
56Ni displaying a higher near-UV flux level. In the NIR range, such variations
in 56Ni mass affect the timing of the secondary maxima but not their magnitude,
in agreement with observational results. Moreover, the variation in the I, J,
and K_s magnitudes is less than 0.1 mag within ~10 days from bolometric
maximum, confirming the potential of NIR photometry of SNe Ia for cosmology.
Overall, the delayed-detonation mechanism in single Chandrasekhar-mass white
dwarf progenitors seems well suited for SN 2002bo and similar SNe Ia displaying
a broad Si II 6355 A line. Whatever multidimensional processes are at play
during the explosion leading to these events, they must conspire to produce an
ejecta comparable to our spherically-symmetric model.

compiled high spatial resolution ($\sim 0.3$--$0.7$ arcsec) mid-IR $N$-band
spectroscopy, $Q$-band imaging and nuclear near- and mid-IR photometry from the
literature. Combining these nuclear near- and mid-IR observations, far-IR
photometry and clumpy torus models, enables us to put constraints on the torus
properties and geometry. We divide the sample into three types according to the
broad line region (BLR) properties; type-1s, type-2s with scattered or hidden
broad line region (HBLR) previously observed, and type-2s without any published
HBLR signature (NHBLR). Comparing the torus model parameters gives us the first
quantitative torus geometrical view for each subgroup. We find that NHBLR AGN
have smaller torus opening angles and larger covering factors than those of
HBLR AGN. This suggests that the chance to observe scattered (polarized) flux
from the BLR in NHBLR could be reduced by the dual effects of (a) less
scattering medium due to the reduced scattering volume given the small torus
opening angle and (b) the increased torus obscuration between the observer and
the scattering region. These effects give a reasonable explanation for the lack
of observed HBLR in some type-2 AGN.

30\%$ (268 stars) has led to a putative discovery. Four distinct mass domains
have been identified, which we have tentatively associated with low,

nevertheless are clearly separated by three distinct break points at 1.05, 2.4,
and 7$M_{\odot}$ within the mass range studied of $0.38-32M_{\odot}$. Further,
a revised mass-luminosity relation (MLR) is found based on linear fits for each
of the mass domains identified. The revised, mass-domain based MLRs, which are
classical ($L \propto M^{\alpha}$), are shown to be preferable to a single
linear, quadratic or cubic equation representing as an alternative MLR. Stellar
radius evolution within the main-sequence for stars with $M>1M_{\odot}$ is
clearly evident on the M-R diagram, but it is not the clear on the $M-T_{eff}$
diagram based on published temperatures. Effective temperatures can be
calculated directly using the well-known Stephan-Boltzmann law by employing the
accurately known values of M and R with the newly defined MLRs. With the
calculated temperatures, stellar temperature evolution within the main-sequence
for stars with $M>1M_{\odot}$ is clearly visible on the $M-T_{eff}$ diagram.
Our study asserts that it is now possible to compute the effective temperature
of a main-sequence star with an accuracy of $\sim 6\%$, as long as its observed

efficiently probe the parameter space. We demonstrate the robustness of the
algorithm using 1728 mock galaxies and galaxies generated from hydrodynamical
simulations in various seeing conditions from 0.6"" to 1.2"". We find that the
algorithm can recover the morphological parameters (inclination, position
angle) to within 10% and the kinematic parameters (maximum rotation velocity)
to within 20%, irrespectively of the PSF in seeing (up to 1.2"") provided that
the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is greater than $\sim3$ pixel$^{-1}$
and that the ratio of the galaxy half-light radius to seeing radius is greater
than about 1.5. One can use such an algorithm to constrain simultaneously the
kinematics and morphological parameters of (nonmerging) galaxies observed in
nonoptimal seeing conditions. The algorithm can also be used on adaptive-optics

features, among those we evaluated, were those based on the number of times a

features inspired us to design an influence-primed h-index (the hip-index).
Unlike the conventional h-index, it weights citations by how many times a

indicator of researcher performance than the conventional h-index.

Sequence (GBS)"" in the (FUV-NUV) versus (NUV-[3.6]) color-color diagram which
is populated by irregular and spiral galaxies, and is mainly driven by changes
in the formation timescale ($\tau$) and a degeneracy between $\tau$ and dust
reddening. The tightness of the GBS provides an unprecedented way of
identifying star-forming galaxies and objects that are just evolving to (or
from) what we call the ""GALEX Green Valley (GGV)"". At the red end of the GBS,
at (NUV-[3.6]) > 5, we find a wider ""GALEX Red Sequence (GRS)"" mostly populated
by E/S0 galaxies that has a perpendicular slope to that of the GBS and of the
optical red sequence. We find no such dichotomy in terms of stellar mass
(measured by $\rm{M}_{[3.6]}$), since both massive ($M_{\star} > 10^{11}

proportionally more often found in the GGV are the S0-Sa's and most of these
are located in high-density environments. We discuss evolutionary models of

13CO lines, closely associated with 6.7GHz methanol masers, hence called
Methanol Maser Associated Outflows (MMAOs). We compare MMAO properties with
those of outflows from other surveys in the literature. In general, MMAOs
follow similar trends, but show a deficit in number at low masses and momenta,
with a corresponding higher fraction at the high end of the distributions. A
similar trend is seen for the dynamical timescales of MMAOs. We argue that the
lack of relatively low mass and young flows in MMAOs is due to the inherent
selection-bias in the sample, i.e. its direct association with 6.7GHz methanol
masers. This implies that methanol masers must switch on after the onset of
outflows (hence accretion), and not before a sufficient abundance of methanol
is liberated from icy dust mantles. Consequently the average dynamical age of
MMAOs is older than for the general population of molecular outflows. We
propose an adjusted evolutionary sequence of outflow and maser occurrence in
the hot core phase, where methanol masers turn on after the onset of the
outflow phase.

lithium by augmenting the Coulombic interactions between the ion and the water
molecules with a standard Lennard-Jones ion-oxygen potential, the same is not
true for solutions of fluoride, for which we find that a potential with a
softer repulsive wall gives much better agreement. A small degree of
destabilization of the first hydration shell is found in quantum simulations of
both ions when compared with classical simulations, with the shell becoming
less sharply defined and the mean residence time of the water molecules in the
shell decreasing. In line with these modest differences, we find that the
mechanisms of the exchange processes are unaffected by quantization, so a
classical description of these reactions gives qualitatively correct and
quantitatively reasonable results. We also find that the quantum effects in
solutions of lithium are larger than in solutions of fluoride. This is partly
due to the stronger interaction of lithium with water molecules, partly due to
the lighter mass of lithium, and partly due to competing quantum effects in the
hydration of fluoride, which are absent in the hydration of lithium.

different types of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Significant
understanding of their equilibrium properties has been achieved to date,
especially for the case of spin models with short-range couplings. However,
progress towards the development of a comparable understanding in long-range
interacting models, in particular out-of-equilibrium, remains limited. In a
recent work, we proposed a semiclassical numerical method to study spin models,
the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA), and demonstrated its
capability to correctly capture the dynamics of one- and two-point correlations
in one dimensional (1D) systems. Here we go one step forward and use the DTWA
method to study the dynamics of correlations in 2D systems with many spins and
different types of long-range couplings, in regimes where other numerical
methods are generally unreliable. We compute spatial and time-dependent
correlations for spin-couplings that decay with distance as a power-law and
determine the velocity at which correlations propagate through the system.
Sharp changes in the behavior of those velocities are found as a function of
the power-law decay exponent. Our predictions are relevant for a broad range of
systems including solid state materials, atom-photon systems and ultracold
gases of polar molecules, trapped ions, Rydberg, and magnetic atoms. We
validate the DTWA predictions for small 2D systems and 1D systems, but
ultimately, in the spirt of quantum simulation, experiments will be needed to
confirm our predictions for large 2D systems.

interacting nuclear matter given the conditions in their interiors, which are
not reproduced in a laboratory environment. Much has been debated about their
composition with possibilities ranging from a simple mixture of mostly protons
and neutrons to deconfined quark matter. Recent observations on the mass of two
pulsars, PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348+0432, have posed a great restriction on
their composition, since the equation of state must be hard enough to support
masses of about at least two solar masses. The onset of quarks tends to soften
the equation of state, but it can get substantially stiffer since in the
high-dense medium a repulsive vector interaction channel is opened.
Nevertheless, we show that once gluon effects are considered, the equation of
state of quark matter in the color-flavor-locked phase of color
superconductivity becomes softer decreasing the maximum stellar mass that can
be reached when not considering their influence. This may indicate that stars
made entirely of color superconducting matter can only be favored to describe
compact stars if the repulsive vector constant is high enough.

  Exact convergence estimates are typically hard to come by. In this paper, we
consider the complementary problem of finding best case estimates, i.e., how
slow the algorithm has to converge, and we also study exact asymptotic rates of
convergence. Our investigation focuses on convex feasibility in the Euclidean

galaxies (dSphs) are investigated. A double-isothermal model of an isothermal
stellar system, embedded in an isothermal dark halo core provides an excellent
fit to the various observed stellar surface density distributions. The stellar
system can be well characterised by King profiles with a broad distribution of
concentration parameters c. The core scale length of the stellar system a_* is
sensitive to the central dark matter density rho_0. In contrast to
single-component systems, the cut-off radius of the stellar system, rs_t,
however does not trace the tidal radius but the core radius r_c of its dark
matter halo. c is therefore sensitive to the ratio of the stellar to the dark
matter velocity dispersion, sigma_*/sigma_0. Simple empirical relationships are
derived that allow to calculate the dark halo core parameters rho_0, r_c and
sigma_0, given the observable quantities sigma_*, a_* and c. The DIS model is
applied to the Milky Way's dSphs. Their halo velocity dispersions lie in a
narrow range of 10km/s <= sigma_0 <= 18km/s with halo core radii of 280pc <=
r_c <= 1.3kpc and r_c=2a_*. All dSphs follow closely the same universal dark
halo core scaling relation rho_0*r_c=75 Msolar/pc^2 that characterises the
cores of more massive galaxies over several orders of magnitude in mass. The
dark matter core mass is a strong function of core radius. Inside a fixed
radius r_u, with r_u the logarithmic mean of the dSph's core radii, the total
enclosed mass M_u is however roughly constant, although outliers should exist.
For our dSphs we find r_u=400pc and M_u=2.6*10^7 Msolar. The core densities of
the Galaxy's dSphs are very high, with rho_0=0.2 Msolar/pc^3. They should
therefore be tidally undisturbed. Observational evidence for tidal effects
might then provide a serious challenge for the cold dark matter scenario.

atomic-collapse state and its population with electrons to require fewer
adsorbed Ca dimers than in the experiment, possibly due to the different

substrate in the experiment. We also predict the onset of filling of a second

region with optical {\em CoRoT} light curves exhibiting short-duration,
shallow, periodic flux dips. All of these stars have infrared (IR) excesses
that are consistent with their having inner disk walls near the Keplerian
co-rotation radius. The repeating photometric dips have FWHM generally less
than one day, depths almost always less than 15%, and periods (3<P<11 days)
consistent with dust near the Keplerian co-rotation period. The flux dips vary
considerably in their depth from epoch to epoch, but usually persist for
several weeks and, in two cases, were present in data collected on successive
years. For several of these stars, we also measure the photospheric rotation
period and find that the rotation and dip periods are the same, as predicted by
standard ""disk-locking"" models. We attribute these flux dips to clumps of
material in or near the inner disk wall, passing through our line of sight to
the stellar photosphere. In some cases, these dips are also present in
simultaneous {\em Spitzer} IRAC light curves at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. We
characterize the properties of these dips, and compare the stars with light
curves exhibiting this behavior to other classes of YSO in NGC 2264. A number
of physical mechanisms could locally increase the dust scale height near the
inner disk wall, and we discuss several of those mechanisms; the most plausible
mechanisms are either a disk warp due to interaction with the stellar magnetic
field or dust entrained in funnel-flow accretion columns arising near the inner
disk wall.

into a form of wave function that undergoes a smooth stochastic drift of the
phase in a local basis, the Quantum Drift (QD) model. This drift is nothing
else but a local energy fluctuation. Unlike Quantum Jumps (QJ) models, no jumps
are present in the density as the evolution is unitary. As a first application,
we address the transport through a resonant state $\left\vert 0\right\rangle $
that undergoes decoherence. We show the equivalence with the decoherent steady
state transport in presence of a B\""{u}ttiker's voltage probe. In order to test
the dynamics, we consider two many-spin systems whith a local energy
fluctuation. A two-spin system is reduced to a two level system (TLS) that
oscillates among $\left\vert 0\right\rangle $ $\equiv $ $ \left\vert \uparrow
\downarrow \right\rangle $ and $\left\vert 1\right\rangle \equiv $ $\left\vert
\downarrow \uparrow \right\rangle $. We show that QD model recovers not only
the exponential damping of the oscillations in the low perturbation regime, but
also the non-trivial bifurcation of the damping rates at a critical point, i.e.
the quantum dynamical phase transition. We also address the spin-wave like
dynamics of local polarization in a spin chain. The QD average solution has
about half the dispersion respect to the mean dynamics than QJ. By evaluating
the Loschmidt Echo (LE), we find that the pure states $\left\vert
0\right\rangle $ and $\left\vert 1\right \rangle $ are quite robust against the
local decoherence. In contrast, the LE, and hence coherence, decays faster when
the system is in a superposition state. Because its simple implementation, the
method is well suited to assess decoherent transport problems as well as to
include decoherence in both one-body and many-body dynamics.

optimization framework is adopted whereby the worst-case operating cost is
accounted for under a given user-defined uncertainty set. This work differs
from previously reported robust solutions in two respects. First, the typically
disregarded correlation of uncertainty sources is explicitly considered through
an ellipsoidal uncertainty set relying on their variance-covariance matrix. In
addition, we describe the analogy between the corresponding second-stage
problem and a certain class of mathematical programs arising in structural
reliability. This analogy gives rise to a relevant probabilistic interpretation
of the second stage, thereby revealing an undisclosed feature of the worst-case
setting characterizing robust optimization with ellipsoidal uncertainty sets.
More importantly, a novel nested decomposition approach based on results from
structural reliability is devised to solve the proposed robust counterpart,
which is cast as an instance of mixed-integer trilevel programming. Numerical
results from several case studies demonstrate that the effect of correlated
uncertainty can be captured by the proposed robust approach.

  Epidemic Spread","Part of it will be published in SDM,15 proceedings",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a network (referred to as
the spectral radius) is an important metric in its own right. Further, for
several models of epidemic spread on networks (e.g., the `flu-like' SIS model),
it has been shown that an epidemic dies out quickly if the spectral radius of
the graph is below a certain threshold that depends on the model parameters.
This motivates a strategy to control epidemic spread by reducing the spectral
radius of the underlying network.
  In this paper, we develop a suite of provable approximation algorithms for
reducing the spectral radius by removing the minimum cost set of edges
(modeling quarantining) or nodes (modeling vaccinations), with different time
and quality tradeoffs. Our main algorithm, \textsc{GreedyWalk}, is based on the
idea of hitting closed walks of a given length, and gives an
$O(\log^2{n})$-approximation, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes; it also
performs much better in practice compared to all prior heuristics proposed for
this problem. We further present a novel sparsification method to improve its
running time.
  In addition, we give a new primal-dual based algorithm with an even better
approximation guarantee ($O(\log n)$), albeit with slower running time. We also
give lower bounds on the worst-case performance of some of the popular
heuristics. Finally we demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms and the
properties of our solutions via extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and
real networks.

We explain the photoemission from the topological surface state . This is done

where $\tau$ is the dimensionless tunneling amplitude of the zero mode surface
states to tunnel into the vacuum. We compute the polarization and intensity of

Dirac Hamiltonian for the surface electron to photons coupling and the
tunneling of the zero mode into the vacuum.
  Within the Green's function formalism we obtain exact results for the emitted
Photoelectrons to second order in the laser field. The number of the emitted
photoelectrons is sensitive to the laser coherent state intensity, the
polarization is sensitive to the surface topology of the electronic states and
the incoming photon polarization. The calculation is performed for the helical,

implicitly depends on the response variable. As a result, the sample
distribution of response variable can- not be used for making inference about
the population. In this research I investigate the problem of informative
sampling from the Bayesian perspective. Application of the Bayesian approach
permits solving the problems, which arise due to complexity of the models,
being used for handling informative sampling. The main objective of the re-
search is to combine the elements of the classical sampling theory and Bayesian
analysis, for identifying and estimating the population model, and the model
describing the sam- pling mechanism. Utilizing the fact that inclusion
probabilities are generally known, the population sum of squares of the models
residuals can be estimated, implementing the techniques of the sampling theory.
In this research I show, how these estimates can be incorporated in the
Bayesian modeling and how the Full Bayesian Significance Test (FBST), which is
based on the Bayesian measure of evidence for precise null hypothesis, can be
utilized as a model identification tool. The results obtained by implementation
of the proposed approach to estimation and identification of the sample
selection model seem promising. At this point I am working on methods of
estimation and identification of the population model. An interesting extension
of my approach is incorporation of known population characteristics into the
estimation process. Some other directions for continuation of my research are
highlighted in the sections which describe the proposed methodology.

BHB to red giant branch stars in each field using identical techniques to our
previous work. We find excellent agreement with our previous measurement of a
power-law for the 2-D projected surface density with an index of
2.6$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ outside of 3 kpc, which flattens to $\alpha <$1.2 inside of
3 kpc. Our findings confirm our previous suggestion that the field BHB stars in
M31 are part of the halo population. However, the total halo profile is now
known to differ from this BHB profile, which suggests that we have isolated the
metal-poor component. This component appears to have an unbroken power-law
profile from 3-150 kpc but accounts for only about half of the total halo
stellar mass. Discrepancies between the BHB density profile and other
measurements of the inner halo are therefore likely due to the different
profile of the metal-rich halo component, which is not only steeper than the
profile of the met al-poor component, but also has a larger core radius. These
profile differences also help to explain the large ratio of BHB/RGB stars in
our observations.

evolutionary algorithms in combination with first-principles calculations. This
new structure having a triclinic symmetry (T-TaO2) is both energetically and
dynamically more favorable than the commonly believed rutile structure

This large difference in electrical property makes TaO2 a potential candidate
for resistance random access memory (RRAM). Furthermore, we have shown that
T-TaO2 is actually a Peierls distorted R-TaO2 phase and the transition between
these two structures is via a directional displacement of Ta atoms. The energy
barrier for the reversible phase transition from R-TaO2 to T-TaO2 is 0.19
eV/atom and the other way around is 0.23 eV/atom, suggesting low power

both interesting in their own right and as a potential source of systematic
error in searches for persistent signals, e.g., from a stochastic
gravitational-wave background. We review possible mechanisms for emission on
these time scales and discuss computational challenges associated with their
detection: namely, the substantial volume of data involved in a search for very
long transients can require vast computer memory and processing time. These
computational difficulties can be addressed through a form of data compression
known as coarse-graining, in which information about short time spans is
discarded in order to reduce the computational requirements of a search. Using
data compression, we demonstrate an efficient radiometer (cross-correlation)
algorithm for the detection of very long transients. In the process, we
identify features of a very long transient search (related to the rotation of
the Earth) that make it more complicated than a search for shorter transient
signals. We implement suitable solutions.

radio-loud BL Lac objects. However, it is not clear whether the recently found
radio-quiet BL Lac objects have the same properties. The occurrence rate of
intranight variation is helpful in distinguishing the mechanism of the

  Methods: We conducted a photometric monitoring of 8 radio-quiet BL Lac
objects by the Xinglong 2.16m and Lijiang 2.4m telescopes. The differential
light curves are calculated between each target and two comparison stars. To
quantify the variation, the significance of variation is examined by a scaled

  Results: No significant variation is found in the 11 sessions of light curves

microvariation in radio-quiet BL Lac objects is consistent with the detection
rate of microvariation in normal radio-quiet AGNs, but much lower than for
radio-loud AGNs. This result indicates that the continua of the radio-quiet BL
Lac objects are not dominated by jets that will induce frequent
microvariations.

define regions in the embedding phase space that are mapped to nodes in the

thus creating a Markov chain representation of the time series. We then apply
this new transformation algorithm to time series generated by the R\""ossler

chaotic time series translate to band or tube-like structures -- thereby
indicating that our algorithm generates networks whose structure is sensitive
to system dynamics. Furthermore we demonstrate that simple network measures
including the mean out degree and variance of out degrees can track changes in
the dynamical behaviour in a manner comparable to the largest Lyapunov

momentum into orbital and spin parts is physically meaningless, the orbital and
spin angular momenta are demonstrated in the first-quantization framework not
to satisfy the standard commutation relation. It is shown on the basis of the
transversality condition that the spin is aligned with the propagation
direction so that only the helicity can be the intrinsic degree of freedom. It
is also shown on the same basis that only in the so-called intrinsic reference
system does the helicity behave intrinsic. The intrinsic reference system of
the photon is determined by the ""action"" of a gauge potential, the Berry
potential, on the helicity of the photon. The Berry potential is fixed by a
vector-valued degree of freedom, called the Berry degree of freedom. Because
only the position of the photon in its intrinsic reference system is
canonically conjugate to the momentum, the intrinsic reference system itself is
endowed with quantum effects that depend on the Berry degree of freedom as well
as the helicity. This not only explains the so-called spin Hall effect of light
but also helps to understand why the total angular momentum cannot be generally
split into helicity-independent orbital and helicity-dependent spin parts.

localized, coherent initial excitation versus delocalized, incoherent initial

on the number of repeated LCS measurements. Possessing the calibration database
enables correcting in one procedure all the spatial distortions caused by
nonlinearity, nonorthogonality and spurious crosstalk couplings of the
microscope scanner piezomanipulators. To provide high precision of spatial
measurements in nanometer range, the calibration is carried out using natural
standards - constants of crystal lattice. The method allows for automatic

Next, focusing on LFTJ applied to the triangle query, we show that for many
graphs boxed LFTJ matches the I/O complexity of the recently by Hu, Tao and
Yufei proposed specialized algorithm MGT for listing tiangles in an out-of-core
setting. We also strengthen the analysis of LFTJ's computational complexity for
the triangle query by considering families of input graphs that are
characterized not only by the number of edges but also by a measure of their
density. E.g., we show that LFTJ achieves a CPU complexity of O(|E|log|E|) for
planar graphs, while on general graphs, no algorithm can be faster than
O(|E|^{1.5}). Finally, we perform an experimental evaluation for the triangle
listing problem confirming our theoretical results and showing the overall
effectiveness of our approach. On all our real-world and synthetic data sets
(some of which containing more than 1.2 billion edges) LFTJ in single-threaded
mode is within a factor of 3 of the specialized MGT; a penalty that---as we
demonstrate---can be alleviated by parallelization.

We show that when we make a canonical transformation on the tree-level action,

renormalized $\Gamma $ functional of the starting theory by a canonical

functions of the couplings may depend on the gauge-fixing parameters, although
the physical quantities remain gauge independent. We discuss nontrivial checks

transported from the disk to the galactic nucleus, in order to mimic, in a way,
the case of self-consistent interactions of an actual N-body simulation. We
thus try to unveil the influence of this mass transportation on the different
families of orbits of stars by monitoring how the percentage of chaotic orbits,
as well as the percentages of orbits of the main regular resonant families,
evolve as the galaxy develops a dense and massive nucleus in its core. The SALI
method is applied to samples of orbits in order to distinguish safely between
ordered and chaotic motion. In addition, a method based on the concept of
spectral dynamics is used for identifying the various families of regular
orbits and also for recognizing the secondary resonances that bifurcate from
them. Our computations strongly suggest that the amount of the observed chaos
is substantially increased as the nucleus becomes more massive. Furthermore,
extensive numerical calculations indicate that there are orbits which change
their nature from regular to chaotic and vice versa and also orbits which
maintain their orbital character during the galactic evolution. The present
outcomes are compared to earlier related work.

of the $AT^{2}$ Fermi-liquid resistivity term below $T^*$ is largely enhanced
with a maximum around 5.2-5.5 GPa. Above $P_c$, the exponent of the resistivity
$\rho(T)$ deviates from 2. At $P_c$, it is close to $n = 5/3$, which is
expected by the theory of three-dimensional ferromagnetic spin fluctuations for
a 2nd-order quantum-critical point (QCP). However, $T_C(P)$ disappears as a
1st-order phase transition, and the critical behavior of resistivity in URhAl
cannot be explained by the theory of a 2nd-order QCP. The 1st-order nature of
the phase transition is weak, and the critical behavior is still dominated by
the spin fluctuation at low temperature. With increasing pressure, the
non-Fermi-liquid behavior is observed in higher fields. Magnetic field studies
point out a ferromagnetic wing structure with a tri-critical point (TCP) at ~
4.8-4.9 GPa in URhAl. One open possibility is that the switch from the
ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic states does not occur simply but an
intermediate state arises below the TCP as suggested theoretically recently.
Quite generally, if a drastic Fermi-surface change occurs through $P_c$, the
nature of the interaction itself may change and lead to the observed
unconventional behavior.

bending deformations of the film. The bending (also known as flexular) mode
turns out to be anomalously weakly attenuated. In the harmonic approximation
there is no viscous-like damping of the bending mode, proportional to q^2 (q is
the wave vector of the mode), since it is forbidden by the rotational symmetry.
Therefore the bending mode is strongly affected by non-linear dynamic
fluctuation effects. We calculate the dominant fluctuation contributions to the
damping of the bending mode due to its coupling to the in-plane viscous mode,
that restores the viscous-like q^2 damping of the bending mode. Our
calculations are performed in the framework of the perturbation theory where
the coupling of the modes is assumed to be small, then the bending mode damping
is relatively weak. We discuss our results in the context of existing

similarly to Blue Compact Dwarfs; they preferably populate low-density
environments in the local Universe: ~60% occupy underdense regions, and ~75%
reside in voids and sheets. This is more extreme than the distribution of
irregular galaxies, and in contrast to those regions preferred by elliptical
galaxies (knots and filaments). We further find results consistent with
previous observations; while the environment does determine the fraction of a
certain galaxy type, it does not determine the overall observational
properties. With the exception of five documented cases (four sources with
companions and one recent merger), XMPs do not generally show signatures of
major mergers and interactions; we find only one XMP with a companion galaxy
within a distance of 100 kpc, and the HI gas in XMPs is typically well-behaved,
demonstrating asymmetries mostly in the outskirts. We conclude that metal-poor
accretion flows may be driving the XMP evolution. Such cosmological accretion
could explain all the major XMP observational properties: isolation, lack of

unsettled, metal-poor HI gas, metallicity inhomogeneities, and large specific

applied to norm-regularized linear least squares problems, for a general class
of norms. The homotopy algorithm reduces the regularization parameter in a
series of steps, and uses a proximal-gradient algorithm to solve the problem at
each step. Proximal-gradient algorithm has a linear rate of convergence given
that the objective function is strongly convex, and the gradient of the smooth
component of the objective function is Lipschitz continuous. In many
applications, the objective function in this type of problem is not strongly
convex, especially when the problem is high-dimensional and regularizers are
chosen that induce sparsity or low-dimensionality. We show that if the linear
sampling matrix satisfies certain assumptions and the regularizing norm is
decomposable, proximal-gradient homotopy algorithm converges with a
\emph{linear rate} even though the objective function is not strongly convex.
Our result generalizes results on the linear convergence of homotopy algorithm
for $l_1$-regularized least squares problems. Numerical experiments are
presented that support the theoretical convergence rate analysis.

characterize the memory effect of the environment, i.e., the dependence of a
quantum state on its past in a time evolution. In this paper, we present a
criterion and propose a measure for non-Markovianity with clear physical
interpretations of the memory effect. The non-Markovianity is defined by the
inequality $T(t_2,t_0)\neq T(t_2,t_1)T(t_1,t_0)$ in terms of memoryless
dynamical map $T$ introduced in this paper. This definition is conceptually
distinct from that based on divisibility used by Rivas et al (Phys. Rev. Lett

of the dynamical map. We demonstrate via a typical quantum process that without
Markovian approximation, nonzero memory effects (non-Markovianity) always exist
even if the non-Markovianity is zero by the other non-Marovianity measures.

of three steps, whose scope changes from local to global. In the local step it
extracts from a pair of images local features (e.g. SIFT). Similar features
from each image are clustered and the clusters are matched yielding a large
number of putative matches. In the second step pairs of spatially close

very long after the ""old"" homological algebra (of derived functors between
abelian categories) was established. This ""new"" homological algebra, of derived
categories and derived functors between them, provides a significantly richer
and more flexible machinery than the ""old"" homological algebra. For instance,
the important concepts of dualizing complex and tilting complex do not exist in
the ""old"" homological algebra.
  This paper is an edited version of the notes for a two-lecture minicourse
given at MSRI in January 2013. Sections 1-5 are about the general theory of
derived categories, and the material is taken from my manuscript ""A Course on
Derived Categories"" (available online). Sections 6-9 are on more specialized
topics, leaning towards noncommutative algebraic geometry.

corrosion rate of irradiated Zr alloys, a combination of experimental (atom
probe tomography, x-ray diffraction and thermoelectric power measurements) and
modelling (density functional theory) techniques are employed to investigate
the non-equilibrium solubility and clustering of Fe and Cr in binary Zr alloys.
Cr occupies both interstitial and substitutional sites in the {\alpha}-Zr
lattice, Fe favours interstitial sites, and a low-symmetry site that was not
previously modelled is found to be the most favourable for Fe. Lattice
expansion as a function of alloying concentration (in the dilute regime) is
strongly anisotropic for Fe additions, expanding the $c$-axis while contracting
the $a$-axis. Defect clusters are observed at higher solution concentrations,
which induce a smaller amount of lattice strain compared to the dilute defects.
In the presence of a Zr vacancy, all two-atom clusters are more soluble than
individual point defects and as many as four Fe or three Cr atoms could be
accommodated in a single Zr vacancy. The Zr vacancy is critical for the
increased solubility of defect clusters, the implications for irradiation
induced microstructure changes in Zr alloys are discussed.

which has historically led to a classification in different sub-classes. The
magnetic field plays a key role in many aspects of the neutron star
phenomenology: it regulates the braking torque responsible for their timing
properties and, for magnetars, it provides the energy budget for the outburst
activity and high quiescent luminosities (usually well above the rotational
energy budget). We aim at unifying this observational variety by linking the
results of the state-of-the-art 2D magneto-thermal simulations with
observational data. The comparison between theory and observations allows to
place two strong constraints on the physical properties of the inner crust.
First, strong electrical currents must circulate in the crust, rather than in
the star core. Second, the innermost part of the crust must be highly
resistive, which is in principle in agreement with the presence of a novel
phase of matter so-called nuclear pasta phase.

is possible to convert the pulsar rotational energy into the energy of Langmuir
waves. The maximum growth rate is achieved in the ""superluminal"" area, where
phase velocity of perturbations is exceeding the speed of light. Therefore
electromagnetic waves do not damp on particles. Instead, they create plasmon
condensate, which is carried out, outside of the pulsar magnetosphere and
reaches the Crab nebula. It is shown, that the transfer of the energy of the
plasmon condensate from the light cylinder to the active region of the nebula
happens practically without losses. Unlike the plasma of the magnetosphere, the
one of nebula contains ions, i.e., it may sustain modulation instability, which
leads to the collapse of the Langmuir condensate. Langmuir wave collapse, in
turn, leads to the acceleration of the distribution function particles.
Furthermore, we consider processes leading to the self-trapping of the
synchrotron radiation, resulting in the growth of the radiation intensity,
which manifests itself observationally as a flare. The condition for the
self-trapping onset is derived, showing that if the phenomena takes place at
$~100 MeV$, then it doesn't happen at lower (or higher) energies. This specific
kind of higher/lower energy cutoff could explain why when we observe the flare
at 100 MeV no enhanced emission is observed at lower/higher energies!

crucial in modulating a host of genetic processes. Although the large-scale
separation of double-stranded DNA has been studied with a variety of
theoretical and experimental techniques, the minute details of the very first
steps of unzipping are still unclear. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations, coarse-grained simulations and a statistical-mechanical model
to study the initiation of DNA unzipping by an external force. The calculation
of the potential of mean force profiles for the initial separation of the first
few terminal base pairs in a DNA oligomer reveal that forces ranging between
130 and 230 pN are needed to disrupt the first base pair, values of an order of
magnitude larger than those needed to disrupt base pairs in partially unzipped
DNA. The force peak has an ""echo,"" of approximately 50 pN, at the distance that
unzips the second base pair. We show that the high peak needed to initiate
unzipping derives from a free energy basin that is distinct from the basins of
subsequent base pairs because of entropic contributions and we highlight the
microscopic origin of the peak. Our results suggest a new window of exploration
for single molecule experiments.

threadlevel parallelism from the body of a loop by breaking it into stages

chain. Slicing, on the other hand, cuts the program along the control chain,
teasing out finer threads that depend on different variables (or locations).

is to demonstrate that the application of DSWP, followed by slicing offers
notable improvements over DSWP alone, especially when there is a loop-carried
dependence that prevents the application of the simpler DOALL optimization.
Experimental results show an improvement of a factor of ?1.6 for DSWP + slicing
over DSWP alone and a factor of ?2.4 for DSWP + slicing over the original

camera. Our method is based on tracking the license plates of cars, which gives
the relative movement of the cars in the image. This image displacement is
translated to actual motion by using the method of projection to a reference
plane, where the reference plane is the road itself. However, since license
plates do not touch the road, we must compensate for the entailed distortion in
speed measurement. We show how to compute the compensation factor using
knowledge of the license plate standard dimensions. Consequently our system
computes the true speed of moving vehicles fast and accurately. We show
promising results on videos obtained in a number of scenes and with different
car models.

small heavy inertial particles with the laminar and turbulent wakes of an
immobile sphere facing an incompressible uniform inflow. Particles that do not
collide with the obstacle but move past it, are found to form preferential
concentrations both in the sphere boundary layer and in its wake. In the
laminar case, the upstream diverging flow pattern is responsible for particle
clustering on a cylinder that extends far downstream the sphere. The interior
of this surface contains no particles and can be seen as a shadow of the large
obstacle. Such concentration profiles are also present in the case of turbulent
wakes but show a finite extension. The sphere shadow is followed by a region
around the axis of symmetry where the concentration is higher than the average.
It originates from a resonant centrifugal expulsion of particles from shed
vortices. The consequence of this concentration mechanism on monodisperse
inter-particle collisions is also briefly discussed. They are enhanced by both
the increased concentration and the presence of large velocity differences
between particles in the wake.

inputs to a set of reducers, such that for each required output there exists a
reducer that receives all the inputs that participate in the computation of
this output. Reducers have a capacity, which limits the sets of inputs that
they can be assigned. However, individual inputs may vary in terms of size. We
consider, for the first time, mapping schemas where input sizes are part of the
considerations and restrictions. One of the significant parameters to optimize
in any MapReduce job is communication cost between the map and reduce phases.
The communication cost can be optimized by minimizing the number of copies of
inputs sent to the reducers. The communication cost is closely related to the
number of reducers of constrained capacity that are used to accommodate
appropriately the inputs, so that the requirement of how the inputs must meet
in a reducer is satisfied. In this work, we consider a family of problems where
it is required that each input meets with each other input in at least one
reducer. We also consider a slightly different family of problems in which,
each input of a set, X, is required to meet each input of another set, Y, in at
least one reducer. We prove that finding an optimal mapping schema for these
families of problem is NP-hard, and present several approximation algorithms
for finding a near optimal mapping schema.

test sample, if the two base samples differ, in order to improve measured
statistics of the test sample. We perform two sets of analyses by selecting
800k (1.7M) SDSS DR8 (DR10) galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. We construct
a base training set by imposing an artificial r band apparent magnitude cut to
select only bright galaxies and then augment this base training set by using
simulations and by applying the K-correct package to artificially place
training set galaxies at a higher redshift.
  We obtain redshift estimates for the remaining faint galaxy sample, which are
not used during training. We find that data augmentation reduces the error on
the recovered redshifts by 40% in both sets of analyses, when compared to the
difference in error between the ideal case and the non augmented case. The
outlier fraction is also reduced by at least 10% and up to 80% using data
augmentation.
  We finally quantify how the recovered redshifts degrade as one probes to
deeper magnitudes past the artificial magnitude limit of the bright training
sample. We find that at all apparent magnitudes explored, the use of data
augmentation with tree based methods provide a estimate of the galaxy redshift
with a negligible bias, although the error on the recovered values increases as
we probe to deeper magnitudes. These results have applications for surveys
which have a spectroscopic training set which forms a biased sample of all
photometric galaxies, for example if the spectroscopic detection magnitude

the low-energy electronic properties of graphene and its multi-layers sensitive
to electron-electron interactions. In bilayers, for instance, interactions are
predicted to open a gap at charge neutrality, turning the system into an
insulator, as observed experimentally. In mono and (Bernal-stacked) trilayers,
interactions, although still important, do not have an equally drastic effect,
and these systems remain conducting at low temperature. It may be expected that
interaction effects become weaker for thicker multilayers, whose behavior
should eventually converge to that of graphite. Here we show that this
expectation does not correspond to reality by investigating the case of
Bernal-stacked tetralayer graphene (4LG). We reveal the occurrence of a robust
insulating state in a narrow range of carrier densities around charge
neutrality, incompatible with the behavior expected from the single-particle
band structure. The phenomenology resembles that observed in bilayers, but the
stronger conductance suppression makes the insulating state in 4LG visible at
higher temperature. To account for our findings, we suggest a natural
generalization of the interaction-driven, symmetry-broken states proposed for
bilayers. This generalization also explains the systematic even-odd effect of
interactions in Bernal-stacked layers of different thickness that is emerging
from experiments, and has implications for the multilayer-to-graphite
crossover.

extremely large value. We identify $\theta_c$ with the Brewster's angle and

tend to zero as $\theta\to 90^\circ$, and satisfy $g^{(E)}<g^{(M)}$ for

that they are virtually impossible for the TM waves with
$\theta\approx\theta_c$. We also give a detailed description of the behavior of

the location and extent of emission regions in a pulsar magnetosphere. As a
precursor to obtaining these constraints, a parameter study was conducted to
reinforce our qualitative understanding of how the underlying model parameters
effect the LCs produced by the geometric models. Extracting useful trends from
the $\gamma$-ray model LCs proved difficult though due to the increased
complexity of the geometric models for the $\gamma$-ray emission relative to
those for the radio emission. In this paper we explore a second approach to
investigating the interplay between the model parameters and the LC atlas. This
approach does not attempt to understand how the set of model parameters
influences the LC shapes directly, but rather, more fundamentally, investigates
how the set of model parameters effects the sky maps from which the latter are
extracted. This allows us to also recognise structure within the atlas itself,
as we are now able to attribute certain features of the LCs to specific
features on the sky map, meaning that we not only understand how the structure
of single LCs come about, but also how their structure changes as we move
through the geometric solution space.

theory is developed to support quantitative measurements now possible in the

compressive fluctuations are energetically decoupled, with the latter passively
advected by the former; the Alfvenic cascade is fluid, satisfying RMHD
equations (with the Alfven speed modified by pressure anisotropy and species
drifts), whereas the compressive cascade is kinetic and subject to
collisionless damping. Secondly, the organising principle of this turbulence is
elucidated in the form of a generalised kinetic free-energy invariant. It is
shown that non-Maxwellian features in the distribution function reduce the rate
of phase mixing and the efficacy of magnetic stresses; these changes influence
the partitioning of free energy amongst the various cascade channels. As the
firehose or mirror instability thresholds are approached, the dynamics of the
plasma are modified so as to reduce the energetic cost of bending
magnetic-field lines or of compressing/rarefying them. Finally, it is shown
that this theory can be derived as a long-wavelength limit of non-Maxwellian
slab gyrokinetics.

sphere. To establish a fractal theory of the Julia sets of infinitely generated
semigroups of rational maps, we introduce a new class of semigroups which we
call nicely expanding rational semigroups. More precisely, we prove Bowen's
formula for the Hausdorff dimension of the pre-Julia sets, which we also
introduce in this paper. We apply our results to the study of the Julia sets of
non-hyperbolic rational semigroups. For these results, we do not assume the
cone condition, which has been assumed in the study of infinite contracting
iterated function systems. Similarly, we show that Bowen's formula holds for
the limit set of a contracting conformal iterated function system without the
cone condition.

that quarks are not confined on domain walls, that strings can end on domain

the study of superfluid turbulence and flow, which is applied here to
oscillating objects submerged in the liquid. We report observations of a
structure seen in videos taken from outside a cryostat filled with superfluid
helium at 2 K, which is possibly a vortex loop attached to an oscillator. The
feature, which has the shape of an incomplete arch, is visualized due to the
presence of solid H2 tracer particles and is attached to a beam oscillating at
38 Hz in the liquid. It has been recorded in videos taken at 240 frames per
second (FPS), fast enough to take around 6 images per period. This makes it
possible to follow the structure, and to see that is not rigid. It moves with
respect to the oscillator, and its displacement is in phase with the velocity
of the moving beam. Analyzing the motion, we come to the conclusion that we may
be observing a superfluid vortex attached to the beam and decorated by the
hydrogen particles. An alternative model, considering a solid hydrogen
filament, has also been analyzed, but the observed phase between the movement
of the beam and the filamentary structure is better explained by the superfluid
vortex hypothesis.

conformally equivalent to any minimal surface in any space forms. Li and
Vrancken classified all Willmore surfaces of tensor product in $S^{n}$ by
reducing them into elastic curves in $S^3$, and the Ejiri torus appeared as a
special example. In this paper, we first prove that among all Willmore tori of
tensor product, the Willmore functional of the Ejiri torus in $S^5$ attains the
minimum $2\pi^2\sqrt{3}$. Then we show that all Willmore tori of tensor product
are unstable when the co-dimension is big enough. We also show that the Ejiri
torus is unstable in $S^5$. Moreover, similar to Li and Vrancken, we classify
all constrained Willmore surfaces of tensor product by reducing them with
elastic curves in $S^3$. All constrained Willmore tori obtained this way are
also shown to be unstable when the co-dimension is big enough.
  We conjecture that a Willmore torus having Willmore functional between

(WDs) triple system PSR J0337+1715. In our scenario a close binary system is
tidally and frictionally destroyed inside the envelope of a massive star that
later goes through an accretion induced collapse (AIC) and forms the neutron
star (NS). The proposed scenario includes a new ingredient of a binary system
that breaks-up inside a common envelope. We use the binary c software to
calculate the post break-up evolution of the system, and show that both low
mass stars end as helium WDs. One of the two lower mass stars that ends further
out, the tertiary star, transfers mass to the ONeMg WD remnant of the massive
star, and triggers the AIC. The inner low mass main sequence star evolves
later, induces AIC if the tertiary had not done it already, and spins-up the NS
to form a millisecond pulsar. This scenario is not extremely sensitive to many
of the parameters, such as the eccentricity of the tertiary star and the
orbital separation of the secondary star after the low mass binary system
breaks loose inside the envelope, and to the initial masses of these stars. The
proposed scenario employs an efficient envelope removal by jets launched by the
compact object immersed in the giant envelope, and the newly proposed grazing
envelope evolution.

in recent time. It analyzes the learning data available in order to make aware
or improvise the process itself and/or the outcome such as student performance.
In this survey paper, we look at the recent research work that has been
conducted around learning analytics, framework and integrated models, and
application of various models and data mining techniques to identify students
at risk and to predict student performance.

impulse response (FIR) filters, i.e. the newly derived and popularized
Kalman-Like unbiased FIR filter (UFIR) and the receding horizon Kalman FIR
filter (RHKF). It is pointed out that the only difference of the two algorithms
lies in the noise statistics ignorance and appropriate initial condition
construction strategy in UFIR. The revelation can benefit the performance
improvement of one by drawing lessons from the other. Some interesting
conclusions have also been drawn and discussed from this revelation.

spatial diffeomorphism invariance. In the unitary gauge, the Goldstone bosons
associated with broken diffeomorphisms are eaten and the graviton becomes a
massive spin-2 particle with 5 well-behaved degrees of freedom. In this gauge,
the most general theory is built with the lowest dimension operators invariant
under only temporal diffeomorphisms. Imposing the additional shift and SO(3)
internal symmetries, we analyze the perturbations on a FRW background. At
linear perturbation level, the observables of this theory are characterized by
five parameters, including the usual cosmological parameters and one additional
coupling constant for the symmetry-breaking scalars. In the de Sitter and
Minkowski limit, the three Goldstone bosons are supermassive and can be
integrated out, leaving two massive tensor modes as the only propagating
degrees of freedom. We discuss several examples relevant to theories of massive
gravity.

  systems","22 pages",,,,"q-bio.MN cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we describe a method to identify ""relevant subsets"" of
variables, useful to understand the organization of a dynamical system. The
variables belonging to a relevant subset should have a strong integration with
the other variables of the same relevant subset, and a much weaker interaction
with the other system variables. On this basis, extending previous works on
neural networks, an information-theoretic measure is introduced, i.e. the
Dynamical Cluster Index, in order to identify good candidate relevant subsets.
The method does not require any previous knowledge of the relationships among
the system variables, but relies on observations of their values in time. We
show its usefulness in several application domains, including: (i) random
boolean networks, where the whole network is made of different subnetworks with
different topological relationships (independent or interacting subnetworks);
(ii) leader-follower dynamics, subject to noise and fluctuations; (iii)
catalytic reaction networks in a flow reactor; (iv) the MAPK signaling pathway
in eukaryotes. The validity of the method has been tested in cases where the
data are generated by a known dynamical model and the Dynamical Cluster Index
method is applied in order to uncover significant aspects of its organization;
however it is important to stress that it can also be applied to time series
coming from field data without any reference to a model. Given that it is based
on relative frequencies of sets of values, the method could be applied also to
cases where the data are not ordered in time. Several indications to improve
the scope and effectiveness of the Dynamical Cluster Index to analyze the
organization of complex systems are finally given.

difficult than measurements of the income distribution, because they require to
follow the evolution of the individuals' income for at least one or two
generations. In micro-to-macro theoretical models of economic exchanges based
on kinetic equations, the income distribution depends only on the asymptotic
equilibrium solutions, while mobility estimates also involve the detailed
structure of the transition probabilities of the model, and are thus an
important tool for assessing its validity. Empirical data show a remarkably
general negative correlation between economic inequality and mobility, whose
explanation is still unclear. It is therefore particularly interesting to study
this correlation in analytical models. In previous work we investigated the
behavior of the Gini inequality index in kinetic models in dependence on
several parameters which define the binary interactions and the taxation and
redistribution processes: saving propensity, taxation rates gap, tax evasion
rate, welfare means-testing etc. Here, we check the correlation of mobility
with inequality by analyzing the mobility dependence from the same parameters.
According to several numerical solutions, the correlation is confirmed to be
negative.
