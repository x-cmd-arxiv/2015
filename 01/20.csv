determine an improved orbital period of 16.87177 $\pm$ 0.02084 days and a long
period of 587 days. We disentangled the light curve into an orbital part,
determining ephemerides and revealing orbital ellipsoidal variability with
unequal maxima, and a long cycle, showing quasi-sinusoidal changes with
amplitude $\Delta V$= 0.1 mag. Assuming synchronous rotation for the cool
stellar component and semi-detached configuration we find a cool evolved star
of $M_{2}$ = 1.9 $\pm$ 0.1 $M_{\odot}$, $T_{2}$ = 8000 $\pm$ 100 $K$ and
$R_{2}$ = 15.6 $\pm$ 0.2 $R_{\odot}$, and an early B-type dwarf of $M_{1}$ =
9.0 $\pm$ 0.2 $M_{\odot}$. The B-type star is surrounded by a geometrically and
optically thick accretion disc of radial extension 20.8 $\pm$ 0.3 $R_{\odot}$
contributing about 35% to the system luminosity at the $V$ band. Two extended
regions located at opposite sides of the disc rim, and hotter than the disc by
67% and 46%, fit the light curve asymmetries. The system is seen under
inclination 67.4 $\pm$ 0.4 degree and it is found at a distance of 238 $\pm$ 10
pc. Specially interesting is the double line nature of HeI 5875; two absorption
components move in anti-phase during the orbital cycle; they can be associated
with the shock regions revealed by the photometry. The radial velocity of one
of the HeI 5875 components closely follows the donor radial velocity,
suggesting that the line is formed in a wind emerging near the stream-disc
interacting region.

using a coarse to fine approach. We argue that modeling the fine depth details
is easier after a coarse depth map has been computed. We express a global
(coarse) depth map of an image as a linear combination of a depth basis learned
from training examples. The depth basis captures spatial and statistical
regularities and reduces the problem of global depth estimation to the task of
predicting the input-specific coefficients in the linear combination. This is
formulated as a regression problem from a holistic representation of the image.
Crucially, the depth basis and the regression function are {\bf coupled} and
jointly optimized by our learning scheme. We demonstrate that this results in a
significant improvement in accuracy compared to direct regression of depth
pixel values or approaches learning the depth basis disjointly from the
regression function. The global depth estimate is then used as a guidance by a
local refinement method that introduces depth details that were not captured at
the global level. Experiments on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets show that our
method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art at a considerably lower
computational cost for both training and testing.

effect, we have applied a magneto-convective model to two low mass stars for
which lithium abundances and precise structural parameters are known: YY Gem

constraints on the following parameters: R, L, surface magnetic field strength,

satisfies the empirical constraints with an internal magnetic field of several
megagauss: such a field strength is within the range of a dynamo where the
field energy is in equipartition with rotational energy deep inside the
convection zone. However, in the case of CU Cnc, the Li requires an internal
magnetic field which is probably too strong for a dynamo origin: we suggest
possible alternatives which might account for the reported Li abundance in CU
Cnc.

A 92, 022115 (2015)","10.1103/PhysRevA.92.022115",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The existence of incompatible measurements is a fundamental phenomenon having
no explanation in classical physics. Intuitively, one considers given
measurements to be incompatible within a framework of a physical theory, if
their simultaneous implementation on a single physical device is prohibited by
the theory itself. In the mathematical language of quantum theory, measurements
are described by POVMs (positive operator valued measures), and given POVMs are
by definition incompatible if they cannot be obtained via coarse-graining from
a single common POVM; this notion generalizes noncommutativity of projective
measurements. In quantum theory, incompatibility can be regarded as a resource
necessary for manifesting phenomena such as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)
Bell inequality violations or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering which do
not have classical explanation. We define operational ways of quantifying this
resource via the amount of added classical noise needed to render the
measurements compatible, i.e., useless as a resource. In analogy to
entanglement measures, we generalize this idea by introducing the concept of

we restrict our consideration to binary measurements, which are already
sufficient to explicitly demonstrate nontrivial features of the theory. In
particular, we construct a family of incompatibility monotones operationally
quantifying violations of certain scaled versions of the CHSH Bell inequality,
prove that they can be computed via a semidefinite program, and show how the
noise-based quantities arise as special cases. We also determine maximal
violations of the new inequalities, demonstrating how Tsirelson's bound appears
as a special case. The resource aspect is further motivated by simple quantum
protocols where our incompatibility monotones appear as relevant figures of
merit.

systems and it is becoming the limiting factor to build and operate Petascale
and Exascale systems. When studying the power consumption of existing systems
running HPC workloads, we find that power, energy and performance are closely
related which leads to the possibility to optimize energy consumption without
sacrificing (much or at all) the performance. In this paper, we propose a HPC
system running with a GNU/Linux OS and a Real Time Resource Manager (RTRM) that
is aware and monitors the healthy of the platform. On the system, an
application for disaster management runs. The application can run with
different QoS depending on the situation. We defined two main situations.
Normal execution, when there is no risk of a disaster, even though we still
have to run the system to look ahead in the near future if the situation
changes suddenly. In the second scenario, the possibilities for a disaster are
very high. Then the allocation of more resources for improving the precision
and the human decision has to be taken into account. The paper shows that at
design time, it is possible to describe different optimal points that are going
to be used at runtime by the RTOS with the application. This environment helps
to the system that must run 24/7 in saving energy with the trade-off of losing
precision. The paper shows a model execution which can improve the precision of
results by 65% in average by increasing the number of iterations from 1e3 to
1e4. This also produces one order of magnitude longer execution time which
leads to the need to use a multi-node solution. The optimal trade-off between
precision vs. execution time is computed by the RTOS with the time overhead
less than 10% against a native execution.

partially reflexive paths bequeath a set of idempotent polymorphisms whose

build on [DaMM ICALP'14] to prove that semicomplete digraphs have the same

  These gap theorems are further motivated by new evidence that PGP could be

collapsibility, tying together the algebraic and structural threads from [Chen

intermediate-level semantic representation shared between an annotated

representation space is learned from the auxiliary dataset and is applied
without adaptation to the target dataset. In this paper we identify two
inherent limitations with these approaches. First, due to having disjoint and
potentially unrelated classes, the projection functions learned from the
auxiliary dataset/domain are biased when applied directly to the target
dataset/domain. We call this problem the projection domain shift problem and
propose a novel framework, transductive multi-view embedding, to solve it. The
second limitation is the prototype sparsity problem which refers to the fact
that for each target class, only a single prototype is available for zero-shot
learning given a semantic representation. To overcome this problem, a novel
heterogeneous multi-view hypergraph label propagation method is formulated for
zero-shot learning in the transductive embedding space. It effectively exploits
the complementary information offered by different semantic representations and
takes advantage of the manifold structures of multiple representation spaces in
a coherent manner. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that the
proposed approach (1) rectifies the projection shift between the auxiliary and
target domains, (2) exploits the complementarity of multiple semantic
representations, (3) significantly outperforms existing methods for both
zero-shot and N-shot recognition on three image and video benchmark datasets,

Secondly, the congestion pricing principles associated with the combined

first-order logic on the class of finite ordered graphs? If $k$ variables are
necessary, as widely believed, it would imply that the bounded (or finite)
variable hierarchy in first-order logic is strict on the class of finite
ordered graphs. In 2008, Rossman made a breakthrough by establishing an optimal
average-case lower bound on the size of constant-depth unbounded fan-in
circuits computing $k$-Clique. In terms of logic, this means that it needs
greater than $\lfloor\frac{k} {4}\rfloor$ variables to describe the $k$-Clique
problem in first-order logic on the class of finite ordered graphs, even in the
presence of arbitrary arithmetic predicates. It follows, with an unpublished
result of Immerman, that the bounded variable hierarchy in first-order logic is
indeed strict. However, Rossman's methods come from circuit complexity and a
novel notion of sensitivity by himself. And the challenge before finite model
theory remains there. In this paper, we give an alternative proof for the
strictness of bounded variable hierarchy in $\fo$ using pure model-theoretic
toolkit, and anwser the question completely for first-order logic, i.e.
$k$-variables are indeed needed to describe $k$-Clique in this logic. In
contrast to Rossman's proof, our proof is purely constructive. Then we embed
the main structures into a pure arithmetic structure to show a similar result
where arbitrary arithmetic predicates are presented. Finally, we discuss its
application in circuit complexity.

\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ of the form $$x(k+1) = f(x(k)) + u(k)$$ where
$$u(k) = (a_1 - 1)f(x(k)) + a_2 f(x(k-T)) + ... + a_N f(x(k-(N-1)T))\;,$$ with

$F: \mathbb{R}^{T+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{T+1}$ whose fixed points
correspond to $T$-cycles of $f$. We then analyze the local stability of the
above DFC mechanism by evaluating the stability of the corresponding equilibrum
points of $F$. We associate to each periodic orbit of $f$ an explicit
polynomial whose Schur stability corresponds to the stability of the DFC on
that orbit. An example indicating the efficacy of this method is provided.

track vortex wakes left by moving animals and objects that passed by up to 30
seconds earlier; this is an impressive feat as the flow features they detect
may have velocity as low as 1 mm/s, and the seals have some capacity to
identify the shape of the object as well. They do so while swimming forward at
high speed, hence their whiskers are sensitive enough to detect small-scale
changes in the external flow field, while rejecting self-generated flow noise.
Here we identify and illustrate a novel flow mechanism that allows artificial
whiskers with the identical unique geometry as those of the harbor seal to
detect the features of minute flow fluctuations in wakes produced by objects
far away. This is shown through the study of a model problem, consisting of a
harbor seal whisker model interacting with the wake of an upstream circular
cylinder. We show that whereas in open water the whisker geometry results in
very low vibration, once it enters a wake it oscillates with large amplitude
and, remarkably, its response frequency coincides with the Strouhal frequency
of the upstream cylinder, thus making the detection of an upstream wake as well
as an estimation of the size and shape of the wake-generating body possible. An
energy flow extraction mechanism causes the large amplitude whisker
oscillations to lock in to the frequency of the oncoming wake, characterized by
a slaloming motion among the oncoming wake vortices. This passive mechanism has
some similarities with the flow mechanisms observed in actively controlled
propulsive foils within upstream wakes and trout swimming behind bluff
cylinders in a stream, but also differences due to the remarkable whisker
morphology which causes it to operate passively and within a much wider
parametric range.

beyond what was previously known conditionally on the Density Hypothesis or the
stronger Riemann Hypothesis. Second, we settle the long-standing conjecture on
the existence of $x^{\epsilon}$-smooth numbers in intervals of the form $[x, x

Riemann Hypothesis) result of Soundararajan. Third, we show that the mean-value

non-trivially bounded in absolute value by $1 - \delta$ for some $\delta > 0$.

Chowla's conjecture. Fourth, we show that a (general) real-valued
multiplicative function $f$ has a positive proportion of sign changes if and

proportion of the integers. This improves on many previous works, and is new
already in the case of the M\""obius function. We also obtain some additional
results on smooth numbers in almost all intervals, and sign changes of
multiplicative functions in all intervals of square-root length.

advantage of the discrete empirical interpolation method and projection that
allows for the approximation of nonlinear terms in a low-dimensional way. The
selected sampling points are shown to be nearly optimal sensing locations for
characterizing the underlying dynamics, stability, and bifurcations of complex
systems. The use of empirical interpolation points and sparse representation
facilitate a family of local reduced-order models for each physical regime,
rather than a higher-order global model, which has the benefit of physical
interpretability of energy transfer between coherent structures. In particular,
the discrete interpolation points and nonlinear modal libraries are used for
sparse representation to classify the dynamic bifurcation regime in the complex

holographic dual are represented by black holes. We study the spectrum of black
holes in Pilch-Warner geometry. These black holes are holographically dual to
equilibrium states of strongly coupled $SU(N)$ ${\cal N}=2^*$ gauge theory
plasma on $S^3$ in the planar limit. We find that there is no energy gap in the
black hole spectrum. Thus, there is a priory no obstruction for equilibration
of arbitrary low-energy states in the theory via a small black hole
gravitational collapse. The latter is contrasted with phenomenological examples
of holography with dual four-dimensional CFTs having non-equal central charges
in the stress-energy tensor trace anomaly.

X-rays, and $\gamma$-rays. It powers a torus-like pulsar wind nebula with jets,
dubbed the Dragonfly, which is very similar to that of the Vela pulsar. The
Dragonfly is likely associated with the extended TeV source VER J2019+368 and
extended radio emission. We conducted first deep optical observations with the
GTC in the Sloan $r'$ band to search for optical counterparts of the pulsar and
its nebula. No counterparts were detected down to $r'\gtrsim27.2$ and
$\gtrsim24.8$ for the point-like pulsar and the compact X-ray nebula,
respectively. We also reanalyzed Chandra archival X-ray data taking into
account an interstellar extinction--distance relation, constructed by us for
the Dragonfly line of sight using the red-clump stars as standard candles. This
allowed us to constrain the distance to the pulsar, $D=1.8^{+1.7}_{-1.4}$ kpc
at 90% confidence. It is much smaller than the dispersion measure distance of
$\sim$12 kpc but compatible with a $\gamma$-ray ""pseudo-distance"" of 1 kpc.
Based on that and the optical upper limits, we conclude that PSR J2021+3651,
similar to the Vela pulsar, is a very inefficient nonthermal emitter in the
optical and X-rays, while its $\gamma$-ray efficiency is consistent with an
average efficiency for $\gamma$-pulsars of similar age. Our optical flux upper
limit for the pulsar is consistent with the long-wavelength extrapolation of
its X-ray spectrum while the nebula flux upper limit does not constrain the
respective extrapolation.

brightnesses of $\mu_B =29$ and luminosities of $\sim 10^6 L_{\odot,B}$. While
the Northeast Plume may be a faint outer extension of the tidal ""crown"" north

simulation and may represent a distinct tidal stream or disrupted dwarf galaxy.
We also trace the extremely diffuse Northwest Plume out to a total extent of
20' (43 kpc) from NGC 5194(M51a), and show it to be physically distinct from
the overlapping bright tidal streams from M51b. The Northwest Plume's

tidal stripping of M51a's extreme outer disk. Finally, we confirm the strong
segregation of gas and stars in the Southeast Tail, and do not detect any
diffuse stellar component in the HI portion of the tail. Extant simulations of
M51 have difficulty matching both the wealth of tidal structure in the system

Mott insulating scenario. We also find indications that the system is

formulate the image reconstruction problem of quantitative photoacoustic

transfer equation with the acoustic wave equation. The inverse problem is
approached by Tikhonov regularization with a convex penalty in combination with
the proximal gradient iteration for minimizing the Tikhonov functional. We

torus T^3 constructed as R^3/L, where L is a crystallographic lattice, we
present a general algorithm to construct solutions of Beltrami equation which
utilizes as main ingredient the orbits under the action of the point group P_L
of three-vectors in the momentum lattice L*. We introduce the new notion of a
Universal Classifying Group GU_L which contains all crystallographic space
groups as proper subgroups. We show that the *d-eigenfunctions are naturally
arranged into irreducible representations of GU_L and by means of a systematic
use of the branching rules with respect to various possible subgroups H of GU_L
we search and find Beltrami fields with non trivial hidden symmetries. In the
case of the cubic lattice the point group P_L is the proper octahedral group
O_24 and the Universal Classifying Group is finite group G_1536 of order 1536

representations and the associated character table. We show that the O_24
orbits in the cubic lattice are arranged into 48 equivalence classes, the
parameters of the corresponding Beltrami vector fields filling all the 37
irreducible representations of G_1536. In this way we obtain an exhaustive
classification of all generalized ABC-flows and of their hidden symmetries. We

excess risk score, ""ERS"" (log10 LCI x log10 LSCD), is non-monotonic under a
change of time units for the rates, which renders meaningless the results
derived from it, including a cluster of 22 ""R-tumor"" types for which they
conclude, ""primary prevention measures are not likely to be very effective"".
Further, r = 0.8 is consistent with the three orders of magnitude variation in
other unmeasured factors, leaving room for the possibility of primary
prevention if such factors can be intervened upon. Further exploration of the
data reveals additional findings: (1) that LCI grows at approximately the
square root of LSCD, which may provide a clue to the biology; (2) among
different possible combinations of the primary data, the one maximizing the

However, contrary to what happens in Mott correlated states the reduction of
the quasiparticle weight Z with JH can happen on spite of increasing charge
fluctuations. Therefore, in Hund metals the quasiparticle weight and the mass
enhancement are not good measurements of the charge localization. Using simple
energetic arguments we explain why the spin polarization induced by Hund's
coupling produces orbital decoupling. We also discuss how the behavior at
moderate interactions, with correlations controlled by the atomic spin
polarization, changes at large $U$ and $J_H$ due to the proximity to a Mott

Dwarfs (WD). The impact of a strong magnetic field onto the structure equations
is addressed. The pressures become anisotropic due to the presence of the
magnetic field and split into a parallel and perpendicular components. We first
construct stable solutions of TOV equations for the parallel pressures, and
found that physical solutions vanish for the perpendicular pressure when $B
\gtrsim 10^{13}$ G. This fact establishes an upper bound for a magnetic field
and the stability of the configurations in the (quasi) spherical approximation.
Our findings also indicate that it is not possible to obtain stable magnetized
WD with super Chandrasekhar masses because the values of the magnetic field
needed for them are higher than this bound. To proceed into the anisotropic
regime, we derived structure equations appropriated for a cylindrical metric
with anisotropic pressures. From the solutions of the structure equations in
cylindrical symmetry we have confirmed the same bound for $B \sim 10^{13} $ G,
since beyond this value no physical solutions are possible. Our tentative
conclusion is that massive WD, with masses well beyond the Chandrasekhar limit
do not constitute stable solutions and should not exist.

electroencephalographic (EEG) data has gained considerable attention over the
last few years. In this paper, we propose an innovative source localization
method for EEG, based on Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL). Methods: To better
specify the sparsity profile and to ensure efficient source localization, the
proposed approach considers grouping of the electrical current dipoles inside
human brain. SBL is used to solve the localization problem in addition with
imposed constraint that the electric current dipoles associated with the brain
activity are isotropic. Results: Numerical experiments are conducted on a
realistic head model that is obtained by segmentation of MRI images of the head
and includes four major components, namely the scalp, the skull, the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain, with appropriate relative conductivity
values. The results demonstrate that the isotropy constraint significantly
improves the performance of SBL. In a noiseless environment, the proposed
method was 1 found to accurately (with accuracy of >75%) locate up to 6
simultaneously active sources, whereas for SBL without the isotropy constraint,
the accuracy of finding just 3 simultaneously active sources was <75%.
Conclusions: Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method
is potentially more consistent in specifying the sparsity profile of human
brain activity and is able to produce better source localization for EEG.

result, the gluon couples to the Veneziano ghost describing the tunneling
transitions between different Chern-Simons sectors of the vacuum; we call the
emerging gluon dressed by ghost loops a ""glost"". We evaluate the glost
propagator and find that it has the form $G(p) = (p^2 + \chi_{top}/p^2)^{-1}$

Yang-Mills theory) or vanishes (in full QCD with light quarks), in accord with

discs around eccentric supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. These are
expected to form from randomly oriented accretion events onto a SMBH binary
formed in a galaxy merger. When expanding the interaction terms between the
binary and a circular ring to quadrupole order and averaging over the binary
orbit, we expect four non-precessing disc orientations: aligned or
counter-aligned with the binary, or polar orbits around the binary eccentricity
vector with either sense of rotation. All other orientations precess around
either of these, with the polar precession dominating for high eccentricity.
These expectations are borne out by smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations
of initially misaligned viscous circumbinary discs, resulting in the formation
of polar rings around highly eccentric binaries in contrast to the co-planar
discs around circular binaries. Moreover, we observe disc tearing and violent
interactions between differentially precessing rings in the disc significantly
disrupting the disc structure and causing gas to fall onto the binary with
little angular momentum. While accretion from a polar disc may not promote SMBH
binary coalescence (solving the `final-parsec problem'), ejection of this
infalling low-angular momentum material via gravitational slingshot is a
possible mechanism to reduce the binary separation. Moreover, this process acts
on dynamical rather than viscous time scales, and so is much faster.

to their origin: stars scattered from the disc of the main galaxy ('heated
disc'), stars formed from gas smoothly accreted on to the halo ('smooth' gas)
and stars formed in streams of gas stripped from infalling satellites
('stripped' gas). We find that most belong to the stripped gas category. Those

place as the stripped-gas population, suggesting that their formation is
associated with the same gas-rich accretion events. The scattered disc star
contribution is negligible overall but significant in the Solar neighbourhood,

However, the distinction between halo and thick disc in this region is highly
ambiguous. The chemical and kinematic properties of the different components
are very similar at the present day, but the global properties of the in situ

extinction. However, we find 10 weak and barely studied DIBs with correlations
that are higher than 0.7 with dust extinction and confirm the high correlation
of additional 5 strong DIBs. Furthermore, we find a pair of DIBs, 5925.9A and
5927.5A which exhibits significant negative correlation with dust extinction,
indicating that their carrier may be depleted on dust. We use Machine Learning
algorithms to divide the DIBs to spectroscopic families based on 250 stacked
spectra. By removing the dust dependency we study how DIBs follow their local

associated with C2 or CN absorption lines.

hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies. Very little work has so far been
performed using radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD), and there is no consensus on the
importance of radiation feedback in galaxy evolution. We present RHD
simulations of isolated galaxy disks of different masses with a resolution of
18 pc. Besides accounting for supernova feedback, our simulations are the first
galaxy-scale simulations to include RHD treatments of photo-ionisation heating
and radiation pressure, from both direct optical/UV radiation and
multi-scattered, re-processed infrared (IR) radiation. Photo-heating smooths
and thickens the disks and suppresses star formation about as much as the
inclusion of (""thermal dump"") supernova feedback does. These effects decrease
with galaxy mass and are mainly due to the prevention of the formation of dense
clouds, as opposed to their destruction. Radiation pressure, whether from
direct or IR radiation, has little effect, but for the IR radiation we show
that its impact is limited by our inability to resolve the high optical depths
for which multi-scattering becomes important. While artificially boosting the
IR optical depths does reduce the star formation, it does so by smoothing the
gas rather than by generating stronger outflows. We conclude that although
higher-resolution simulations, and potentially also different supernova
implementations, are needed for confirmation, our findings suggest that
radiation feedback is more gentle and less effective than is often assumed in
subgrid prescriptions.

corroborate the existence of a strong correlation between BHAR (i.e. the X-ray

starbursts show a factor of 3 enhancement in BHAR compared to normal SF
galaxies (against a factor of 6 excess in SFR), while quiescents show a deficit
of a factor 5.5 at a given mass. One possible interpretation of this is that
the starburst phase does not coincide with cosmologically relevant BH growth,
or that starburst-inducing mergers are more efficient at boosting SFR than
BHAR. Contrary to studies based on smaller samples, we find the BHAR/SFR ratio
of main sequence (MS) galaxies is not mass invariant, but scales weakly as
M*^(0.43\pm0.09}, implying faster BH growth in more massive galaxies at
$z\sim2$. Furthermore, BHAR/SFR during the starburst is a factor of 2 lower
than in MS galaxies, at odds with the predictions of hydrodynamical simulations
of merger galaxies that foresee a sudden enhancement of L_X/SFR during the

derived from analytical extrapolations of the debris dynamical properties just
after disruption. By means of hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the
subsequent fallback of the stream of debris towards the black hole for stars
already bound to the black hole on eccentric orbits. We demonstrate that the
debris circularize due to relativistic apsidal precession which causes the
stream to self-cross. The circularization timescale varies between 1 and 10
times the period of the star, being shorter for more eccentric and/or deeper
encounters. This self-crossing leads to the formation of shocks that increase
the thermal energy of the debris. If this thermal energy is efficiently
radiated away, the debris settle in a narrow ring at the circularization radius
with shock-induced luminosities of $\sim 10-10^3 \, L_{\rm Edd}$. If instead
cooling is impeded, the debris form an extended torus located between the
circularization radius and the semi-major axis of the star with heating rates
$\sim 1-10^2 \, L_{\rm Edd}$. Extrapolating our results to parabolic orbits, we
infer that circularization would occur via the same mechanism in $\sim 1$
period of the most bound debris for deeply penetrating encounters to $\sim 10$
for grazing ones. We also anticipate the same effect of the cooling efficiency
on the structure of the disc with associated luminosities of $\sim 1-10 \,
L_{\rm Edd}$ and heating rates of $\sim 0.1-1 \, L_{\rm Edd}$. In the latter
case of inefficient cooling, we deduce a viscous timescale generally shorter
than the circularization timescale. This suggests an accretion rate through the
disc tracing the fallback rate, if viscosity starts acting promptly.

Universe. The exact nature of their progenitor systems however remain unclear.
Radio emission from the interaction between the explosion shock front and its
surrounding CSM or ISM provides an important probe into the progenitor star's
last evolutionary stage. No radio emission has yet been detected from Type Ia
supernovae by current telescopes. The SKA will hopefully detect radio emission
from Type Ia supernovae due to its much better sensitivity and resolution.
There is a 'supernovae rate problem' for the core collapse supernovae because
the optically dim ones are missed due to being intrinsically faint and/or due
to dust obscuration. A number of dust-enshrouded optically hidden supernovae
should be discovered via SKA1-MID/survey, especially for those located in the
innermost regions of their host galaxies. Meanwhile, the detection of
intrinsically dim SNe will also benefit from SKA1. The detection rate will
provide unique information about the current star formation rate and the
initial mass function. A supernova explosion triggers a shock wave which expels
and heats the surrounding CSM and ISM, and forms a supernova remnant (SNR). It
is expected that more SNRs will be discovered by the SKA. This may decrease the
discrepancy between the expected and observed numbers of SNRs. Several SNRs
have been confirmed to accelerate protons, the main component of cosmic rays,

novel algorithms for RNA secondary structure kinetics. Using the fast Fourier
transform to efficiently compute the Boltzmann probability that a secondary
structure S of a given RNA sequence has base pair distance x [resp. y] from
reference structure A [resp. B], Hermes computes the exact kinetics of folding
from A to B in this coarse-grained model. In particular, Hermes computes the
mean first passage time from the transition probability matrix by using matrix
inversion, and also computes the equilibrium time from the rate matrix by using
spectral decomposition. Due to the model granularity and the speed of Hermes,
it is capable of determining secondary structure refolding kinetics for large
RNA sequences, beyond the range of other methods. Comparative benchmarking of
Hermes with other methods indicates that Hermes provides refolding kinetics of
accuracy suitable for use in computational design of RNA, an important area of
synthetic biology. Source code and documentation for Hermes are available at

the inner main belt, bounded in semimajor axis by the Mars-crossing region and
the Jupiter 3:1 mean-motion resonance. This group is important as the most
likely source region for the target of the OSIRIS-REx mission, (101955) Bennu;
however, family membership in the region is complicated by the presence of
several dynamically overlapping families with a range of surface properties.
The large S-type structure in the region appears to be associated with the
parent body (135) Hertha, and displays an ($e_\text{P},a_\text{P}$) correlation
consistent with a collision event near true anomaly of ~180 degrees with ejecta
velocity $v_\text{ej} \sim 285$ m/s. The ejecta distribution from a collision
with these orbital properties is predicted to have a maximum semimajor axis
dispersion of $\delta a_{ej} = 0.005 \pm 0.008$ AU, which constitutes only a
small fraction (7\%) of the observed semimajor axis dispersion, the rest of
which is attributed to the Yarkovsky effect. The age of the family is inferred
from the Yarkovsky dispersion to be $300^{+60}_{-50}$ My. Objects in a smaller
cluster that overlaps the large Hertha family in proper orbital element space
have reflectance properties more consistent with the X-type (135) Hertha than
the surrounding S-type family. These objects form a distinct Yarkovsky ""V""
signature in ($a_\text{P},H$) space, consistent with a more recent collision,
apparently also dynamically connected to (135) Hertha. The Nysa-Polana complex
also contains a low-albedo family associated with (142) Polana (called ""New
Polana"" by Walsh et al. 2013), and two other low-albedo families associated
with (495) Eulalia. The second Eulalia family may be a high-$a_\text{P}$,
low-$e_\text{P}$, low-$i_\text{P}$ component of the first Eulalia
family-forming collision, possibly explained by an anisotropic ejection field.

the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background off of
intra-cluster gas. The cluster selection function from such surveys is expected
to be nearly independent of redshift and cluster astrophysics. In this work, we
estimate the effect on the observed SZ signal of centrally-peaked gas density
profiles (cool cores) and radio emission from the brightest cluster galaxy
(BCG) by creating mock observations of a sample of clusters that span the
observed range of classical cooling rates and radio luminosities. For each
cluster, we make simulated SZ observations by the South Pole Telescope and
characterize the cluster selection function, but note that our results are
broadly applicable to other SZ surveys. We find that the inclusion of a cool
core can cause a change in the measured SPT significance of a cluster between
0.01% - 10% at z > 0.3, increasing with cuspiness of the cool core and angular
size on the sky of the cluster (i.e., decreasing redshift, increasing mass). We
provide quantitative estimates of the bias in the SZ signal as a function of a
gas density cuspiness parameter, redshift, mass, and the 1.4 GHz radio
luminosity of the central AGN. Based on this work, we estimate that, for the
Phoenix cluster (one of the strongest cool cores known), the presence of a cool
core is biasing the SZ significance high by ~ 6%. The ubiquity of radio
galaxies at the centers of cool core clusters will offset the cool core bias to
varying degrees.

Minkowski spacetime, there is not yet a standard way to resolve the
quantization ambiguities arising in its construction. These ambiguities are
conveniently encoded in the choice of a complex structure. We explore in this
paper the space of complex structures for real scalar Klein-Gordon theory based
on a number of criteria. These are: invariance under AdS isometries, induction
of a positive definite inner product, compatibility with the standard S-matrix
picture and recovery of standard structures in Minkowski spacetime under a
limit of vanishing curvature. While there is no complex structure that
satisfies all demands, we emphasize two interesting candidates that satisfy
most: In one case we have to give up part of the isometry invariance, in the
other case the induced inner product is indefinite.

galaxy clusters, has its origin in the week fluctuations of density that
existed at the epoch of recombination. The hierarchical distribution of the
universe, with its galaxies, clusters and super-clusters of galaxies indicates
the absence of a natural length scale. In the Newtonian formulation, numerical
simulations of a one-dimensional system permit us to precisely follow the
evolution of an ensemble of particles starting with an initial perturbation in
the Hubble flow. The limitation of the investigation to one dimension removes
the necessity to make approximations in calculating the gravitational field
and, on the whole, the system dynamics. It is then possible to accurately
follow the trajectories of particles for a long time. The simulations show the
emergence of a self-similar hierarchical structure in both the phase space and
the configuration space and invites the implementation of a multifractal
analysis. Here, after showing that symmetry considerations leads to the
construction of a family of equations of motion of the one-dimensional
gravitational system, we apply four different methods for computing generalized
dimensions $D_q$ of the distribution of particles in configuration space. We
first employ the conventional box counting and correlation integral methods
based on partitions of equal size and then the less familiar nearest-neighbor
and k-neighbor methods based on partitions of equal mass. We show that the

of nodes have great influence on the community structure. For example, in a
social network, more connections are established between geographically
proximate users. The impact of locations on community has not been fully
investigated by the research literature. In this paper, we propose a community

to detect communities with both geographic proximity and network closeness. We
analyze the distribution of the distances between connected and unconnected

location-based community detection method is suitable for a given network. We
propose a new community detection algorithm that pushes the location

transfer appears nearly negligible in these systems, an electronic polarization
is indeed significant leading to a systematically positive effective
electrostatic charge on the C60 fullerene: +0.14e in [EMIM][Cl], +0.21e in

various valley-contrasted physical properties; for instance, valley-dependent
topological transport is of both scientific and technological interests.
Bilayer graphene (BLG) is a unique system whose intrinsic inversion symmetry
can be controllably broken by a perpendicular electric field, offering a rare
possibility for continuously tunable valley-topological transport. Here, we
used a perpendicular gate electric field to break the inversion symmetry in
BLG, and a giant nonlocal response was observed as a result of the topological
transport of the valley pseudospin. We further showed that the valley transport
is fully tunable by external gates, and that the nonlocal signal persists up to

significant interest recently due to a number of exotic and new phenomena
induced by the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling, bandwidth W and
on-site Coulomb correlation U. In contrast to a metallic behavior expected from
the Mott-Hubbard model due to more spatially extended 5d orbitals and moderate
U, an insulating ground state has been observed in Sr2IrO4. Such an insulating
behavior can be understood by an effective J_eff=1/2 Mott insulator model by
incorporating both electron correlation and strong spin-orbital coupling,
although its validity remains under debate at present. In particular, Sr2IrO4
exhibits a number of similarities to the high temperature cuprate
superconductors in the crystal structure, electronic structure, magnetic
structure, and even possible high temperature superconductivity. Here we report
a new observation of the anomalous high energy electronic structure in Sr2IrO4.
By taking high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements on Sr2IrO4
over a wide energy range, we have revealed that the high energy electronic
structures show unusual nearly-vertical bands that extend over a large energy
range. Such anomalous high energy behaviors resemble the high energy waterfall
features observed in the cuprate superconductors, adding one more important
similarity between these two systems. While strong electron correlation plays
an important role in producing high energy waterfall features in the cuprate
superconductors, the revelation of the high energy anomalies in Sr2IrO4 points
to a novel route in generating exotic electronic excitations from the strong
spin-orbit coupling and a moderate electron correlation.

$\Gamma(\Upsilon(1S)\to \ell^+\ell^-)$ has been finished by Beneke {\it et al.}
\cite{Beneke:2014qea}. Based on those improvements, we present a
renormalization group (RG) improved pQCD prediction for $\Gamma(\Upsilon(1S)\to
\ell^+\ell^-)$ by applying the principle of maximum conformality (PMC). The PMC
is based on RG-invariance and is designed to solve the pQCD renormalization
scheme and scale ambiguities. After applying the PMC, all known-type of
$\beta$-terms at all orders, which are controlled by the RG-equation, are
resummed to determine optimal renormalization scale for its strong running
coupling at each order. We then achieve a more convergent pQCD series, a
scheme- independent and more accurate pQCD prediction for $\Upsilon(1S)$
leptonic decay, i.e. $\Gamma_{\Upsilon(1S) \to e^+ e^-}|_{\rm PMC} =
1.270^{+0.137}_{-0.187}$ keV, where the uncertainty is the squared average of
the mentioned pQCD errors. This RG-improved pQCD prediction agrees with the
experimental measurement within errors.

proximity-induced superconducting state formed at the interface between a 3D
strong topological insulator (TI) and a d-wave superconductor (dSC). This
system is a playground for studying massless Dirac fermions, as they enter both
as quasiparticles of the dSC and as surface states of the TI. For TI surface
states with a single Dirac point, the four nodes in the interface-state
quasiparticle excitation spectrum coalesce into a single node as the chemical
potential, $\mu$, is tuned from above the impurity scattering rate ($|\mu| \gg
\Gamma_0$) to below ($|\mu| \ll \Gamma_0$). We calculate, via Kubo formula, the
universal limit ($T \rightarrow 0$) thermal conductivity, $\kappa_0$, as a
function of $\mu$, as it is tuned through this transition. In the large and
small $|\mu|$ limits, we obtain disorder-independent, closed-form expressions
for $\kappa_0/T$. The large-$|\mu|$ expression is exactly half the value
expected for a d-wave superconductor, a demonstration of the sense in which the
TI surface topological metal is half of an ordinary 2D electron gas. Our
numerical results for intermediate $|\mu|$ illustrate the nature of the
transition between these limits, which is shown to depend on disorder in a
well-defined manner.

for numerous applications. Such recognition is essential for estimation of
fill-level, volume and phase-boundaries as well as for tracking of such
chemical processes as precipitation, crystallization, condensation, evaporation
and phase-separation. The problem of material boundary recognition in images is
particularly complex for materials with non-flat surfaces, i.e., solids,
powders and viscous fluids, in which the material interfaces have unpredictable
shapes. This work demonstrates a general method for finding the boundaries of
materials inside transparent containers in images. The method uses an image of
the transparent vessel containing the material and the boundary of the vessel
in this image. The recognition is based on the assumption that the material
boundary appears in the image in the form of a curve (with various constraints)
whose endpoints are both positioned on the vessel contour. The probability that
a curve matches the material boundary in the image is evaluated using a cost
function based on some image properties along this curve. Several image
properties were examined as indicators for the material boundary. The optimal
boundary curve was found using Dijkstra's algorithm. The method was
successfully examined for recognition of various types of phase-boundaries,
including liquid-air, solid-air and solid-liquid interfaces, as well as for
various types of glassware containers from everyday life and the chemistry
laboratory (i.e., bottles, beakers, flasks, jars, columns, vials and
separation-funnels). In addition, the method can be easily extended to
materials carried on top of carrier vessels (i.e., plates, spoons, spatulas).

totally avoid such a cooperation, since a single transceiver node transmits
packets and receives them after traversing back from the network. Furthermore,
we are interested in identification of a limited number of bottleneck links, so
we naturally introduce compressed sensing technique into it. Allowing two kinds

the effectiveness of the proposed reflective network tomography scheme.

simultaneously describing both RHIC and LHC data; leading order drag results
without fluctuations are falsified by current data. Including the fluctuations

time. Specifically, we investigate the task-dependent scaling of frontal BOLD
responses with ToT during hierarchical cognitive control. We observe a
paradoxical relationship, whereby rostral regions show greater scaling with ToT
on a first-order task, despite showing greater recruitment on a second-order
task; caudal regions show the converse relationships. Together, these results
demonstrate that ToT does not reflect a single dimension of difficulty that

successive cancellation (SC) and successive cancellation list (SCL) decoders
for polar codes, which use symbol-wise hard or soft decisions for higher
throughput or better error performance. First, we propose to use a recursive
channel combination to calculate symbol-wise channel transition probabilities,
which lead to symbol decisions. Our proposed recursive channel combination also
has a lower complexity than simply combining bit-wise channel transition
probabilities. The similarity between our proposed method and Arikan's channel
transformations also helps to share hardware resources between calculating bit-
and symbol-wise channel transition probabilities. Second, a two-stage list
pruning network is proposed to provide a trade-off between the error
performance and the complexity of the symbol-decision SCL decoder. Third, since
memory is a significant part of SCL decoders, we propose a pre-computation
memory-saving technique to reduce memory requirement of an SCL decoder.
Finally, to evaluate the throughput advantage of our symbol-decision decoders,
we design an architecture based on a semi-parallel successive cancellation list
decoder. In this architecture, different symbol sizes, sorting implementations,

in terms of area efficiency, our symbol-decision SCL decoders outperform both

biological systems over time and in different environments. We here develop a
theory for the dynamics of evolution in a rugged, modular fitness landscape. We
show analytically how horizontal gene transfer couples to the modularity in the
system and leads to more rapid rates of evolution at short times. The model, in
general, analytically demonstrates a selective pressure for the prevalence of
modularity in biology. We use this model to show how the evolution of the
influenza virus is affected by the modularity of the proteins that are

overlap when biological components are involved in multiple functions. However,
traditional clustering methods detect non-overlapping communities. These

traditional methods are sensitive to noise and parameter settings. These
aspects of traditional clustering methods limit our ability to detect
biological communities, and therefore our ability to understand biological

  To address these limitations and detect robust overlapping biological
communities, we propose an unorthodox clustering method called SpeakEasy which
identifies communities using top-down and bottom-up approaches simultaneously.
Specifically, nodes join communities based on their local connections, as well
as global information about the network structure. This method can quantify the
stability of each community, automatically identify the number of communities,
and quickly cluster networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes.
  SpeakEasy shows top performance on synthetic clustering benchmarks and
accurately identifies meaningful biological communities in a range of datasets,
including: gene microarrays, protein interactions, sorted cell populations,
electrophysiology and fMRI brain imaging.

Monitoring the evolution of the radio emission during their sporadic outbursts

long-standing goal in computer vision research. Existing literature suggests
that pixel-wise face alignment is the key to achieve high-accuracy face
recognition. By assuming a human face as piece-wise planar surfaces, where each
surface corresponds to a facial part, we develop in this paper a Constrained
Part-based Alignment (CPA) algorithm for face recognition across pose and/or
expression. Our proposed algorithm is based on a trainable CPA model, which
learns appearance evidence of individual parts and a tree-structured shape
configuration among different parts. Given a probe face, CPA simultaneously
aligns all its parts by fitting them to the appearance evidence with
consideration of the constraint from the tree-structured shape configuration.
This objective is formulated as a norm minimization problem regularized by
graph likelihoods. CPA can be easily integrated with many existing classifiers
to perform part-based face recognition. Extensive experiments on benchmark face
datasets show that CPA outperforms or is on par with existing methods for
robust face recognition across pose, expression, and/or illumination changes.

OI $\lambda$8446. The new measurements show trends consistent with previous
lower $z$ observations, indicating that CaII and optical FeII emission are
probably closely related. The ratio between the CaII triplet and the optical
FeII blend at $\lambda$4570 $\AA$ is apparently systematically larger in our
intermediate redshift sample relative to a low-$z$ control sample. Even if this
result needs a larger sample for adequate interpretation, higher CaII/optical
FeII should be associated with recent episodes of star formation in the
intermediate redshift quasars and, at least in part, explain an apparent
correlation of CaII triplet equivalent width with $z$ and $L$. The CaII triplet
measures yield significant constraints on the emitting region density and
ionization parameter, implying CaII triplet emission from log n$_H$ $\gtrsim$

environment. A crucial problem is therefore to find precise criteria for a
given contact to remain stable or to break. For rigid surface contacts, the
most general criterion is the Contact Wrench Condition (CWC). To check whether
a motion satisfies the CWC, existing approaches take into account a large
number of individual contact forces (for instance, one at each vertex of the
support polygon), which is computationally costly and prevents the use of
efficient inverse-dynamics methods. Here we argue that the CWC can be
explicitly computed without reference to individual contact forces, and give
closed-form formulae in the case of rectangular surfaces -- which is of
practical importance. It turns out that these formulae simply and naturally
express three conditions: (i) Coulomb friction on the resultant force, (ii) ZMP
inside the support area, and (iii) bounds on the yaw torque. Conditions (i) and
(ii) are already known, but condition (iii) is, to the best of our knowledge,
novel. It is also of particular interest for biped locomotion, where undesired
foot yaw rotations are a known issue. We also show that our formulae yield
simpler and faster computations than existing approaches for humanoid motions
in single support, and demonstrate their consistency in the OpenHRP simulator.

spectrograph (MOS) on the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). The MOS
case draws on all fields of contemporary astronomy, from extra-solar planets,
to the study of the halo of the Milky Way and its satellites, and from resolved
stellar populations in nearby galaxies out to observations of the earliest
'first-light' structures in the partially-reionised Universe. The material
presented here results from thorough discussions within the community over the
past four years, building on the past competitive studies to agree a common
strategy toward realising a MOS capability on the E-ELT. The cases have been
distilled to a set of common requirements which will be used to define the
MOSAIC instrument, entailing two observational modes ('high multiplex' and
'high definition'). When combined with the unprecedented sensitivity of the
E-ELT, MOSAIC will be the world's leading MOS facility. In analysing the
requirements we also identify a high-multiplex MOS for the longer-term plans
for the E-ELT, with an even greater multiplex (>1000 targets) to enable studies
of large-scale structures in the high-redshift Universe. Following the green
light for the construction of the E-ELT the MOS community, structured through
the MOSAIC consortium, is eager to realise a MOS on the E-ELT as soon as
possible. We argue that several of the most compelling cases for ELT science,
in highly competitive areas of modern astronomy, demand such a capability. For
example, MOS observations in the early stages of E-ELT operations will be
essential for follow-up of sources identified by the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST). In particular, multi-object adaptive optics and accurate sky

analysis of the dc magnetoconductivity which takes into account the
contribution from radiation in an exact way. A many-electron model of the
dynamic structure factor of the 2D Coulomb liquid is used to describe the
influence of strong internal forces acting between electrons. For low electron
densities and high amplitudes of the microwave field, the dc
magnetoconductivity is shown to become negative in the vicinity of the CR which
causes the instability. This effect is strongly suppressed by Coulomb forces in
the region of high densities.

Specifically, we decompose the task of reconstructing the whole network into
recovering local structures centered at each node. Thus, the natural sparsity

reconstruction into a sparse signal reconstruction problem that can be
addressed by using the lasso, a convex optimization method. We apply our method
to evolutionary games, transportation and communication processes taking place

perturbative approach to relative stabilities of pi-electron systems of
conjugated hydrocarbons modeled as sets of weakly-interacting initially-double
(C=C) bonds. Distinct isomers of acyclic hydrocarbons (polyenes) are now under
focus. The relevant total pi-electron energies (E) are expressed in the form of
power series containing members (E_(k)) of even orders (k=0,2,4,...) with
respect to the averaged resonance parameter of initially-single (C-C) bonds.
Terms to within the sixth order (k=6) inclusive are shown to be of importance
for discrimination between similar isomers. In this connection, missing
expressions for corrections E_(6) are originally derived. Conjugated paths of
various lengths (i.e. linear chains consisting of C=C and C-C bonds
alternately) are shown to be the most important (but not the only) fragments
contributing to stabilization of any acyclic pi-electron system. Again, new
types of fragments (substructures) are revealed (viz. the so-called composite
conjugated paths) that contribute to destabilization of the system concerned.
As a result, formation of the total energy of an acyclic pi-electron system is
concluded to be governed by an interplay between stabilizing and destabilizing
factors. Accordingly, the perturbative approach applied offers us an extension
of the concept of conjugated paths. Particular isomers containing four, five
and six C=C bonds are considered in a detail as examples.

path difference (dOPD) between the targets of few nanometers and the paths
within the interferometer have to be maintained stable to that level. For this
purpose, the novel metrology system of GRAVITY will monitor the internal dOPDs
by means of phase-shifting interferometry. We present the four-step
phase-shifting concept of the metrology with emphasis on the method used for
calibrating the phase shifts. The latter is based on a phase-step insensitive
algorithm which unambiguously extracts phases in contrast to other methods that
are strongly limited by non-linearities of the phase-shifting device. The main
constraint of this algorithm is to introduce a robust ellipse fitting routine.

approach is fully implemented in an example that involves the heat equation. In
this example, the thermal diffusivity is the unknown parameter. We assume that
the thermal diffusivity parameter can be modeled a priori through a lognormal
random variable or by means of a space-dependent stationary lognormal random
field. Synthetic data are used to test the inference. We exploit the behavior
of the non-normalized log posterior distribution of the thermal diffusivity.
Then, we use the Laplace method to obtain an approximated Gaussian posterior

camera networks is the correct association of each persons observations

involves only local information processing on each camera node and mutual
information exchanging between neighboring cameras has attracted many research
interests due to its superiority in large scale applications. In this paper, we
formulate the problem of data association in smart camera networks as an
Integer Programming problem by introducing a set of linking variables, and
propose two distributed algorithms, namely L-DD and Q-DD, to solve the Integer
Programming problem using dual decomposition technique. In our algorithms, the
original IP problem is decomposed into several sub-problems, which can be
solved locally and efficiently on each smart camera, and then different
sub-problems reach consensus on their solutions in a rigorous way by adjusting
their parameters based on projected sub-gradient optimization. The proposed
methods are simple and flexible, in that (i) we can incorporate any feature
extraction and matching technique into our framework to measure the similarity
between two observations, which is used to define the cost of each link, and
(ii) we can decompose the original problem in any way as long as the resulting
sub-problem can be solved independently on individual camera. We show the
competitiveness of our methods in both accuracy and speed by theoretical
analysis and experimental comparison with state of the art algorithms on two
real data sets collected by camera networks in our campus garden and office

applied to the non-conservative form of the equations reproduces smooth
solutions of these free boundary problems very well, but fails when shocks are
formed. A non-oscillatory central difference (NOC) scheme with TVD limiter or

introduced. For the avalanche free boundary problems it must be combined with a
front-tracking method, developed here, to properly describe the margin
evolution. It is found that this NOC scheme combined with the front-tracking

piecewise quadratic WENO reconstruction improves the smoothness of the solution
near local extrema. The schemes are checked against exact solutions for (1) an

individual node is a common phenomenon. Various metrics have been proposed to
measure the efficacy of the repair of a failed node, such as the amount of data
download needed to repair (also known as the repair bandwidth), the amount of
data accessed at the helper nodes, and the number of helper nodes contacted.
Clearly, the amount of data accessed can never be smaller than the repair
bandwidth. In the case of a help-by-transfer code, the amount of data accessed
is equal to the repair bandwidth. It follows that a help-by-transfer code
possessing optimal repair bandwidth is access optimal. The focus of the present
paper is on help-by-transfer codes that employ minimum possible bandwidth to
repair the systematic nodes and are thus access optimal for the repair of a
systematic node.
  The zigzag construction by Tamo et al. in which both systematic and parity
nodes are repaired is access optimal. But the sub-packetization level required
is $r^k$ where $r$ is the number of parities and $k$ is the number of
systematic nodes. To date, the best known achievable sub-packetization level
for access-optimal codes is $r^{k/r}$ in a MISER-code-based construction by
Cadambe et al. in which only the systematic nodes are repaired and where the
location of symbols transmitted by a helper node depends only on the failed
node and is the same for all helper nodes. Under this set-up, it turns out that
this sub-packetization level cannot be improved upon. In the present paper, we
present an alternate construction under the same setup, of an access-optimal
code repairing systematic nodes, that is inspired by the zigzag code
construction and that also achieves a sub-packetization level of $r^{k/r}$.

quasi one dimensional BECs from the viewpoint of integrability. To start with,
we consider the dynamics of scalar BECs in a time independent harmonic trap and
observe that the scattering length (SL) can be suitably manipulated either to
compress the bright solitons to attain peak matter wave density without causing
their explosion or to broaden the width of the condensates without diluting
them. When the harmonic trap frequency becomes time dependent, we notice that
one can stabilize the condensates in the confining domain while the density of
the condensates continue to increase in the expulsive region. We also observe
that the trap frequency and the temporal SL can be maneuvered to generate
matter wave interference patterns indicating the coherent nature of the atoms
in the condensates. We also notice that a small repulsive three body
interaction when reinforced with attractive binary interaction can extend the
region of stability of the condensates in the quasi-one dimensional regime. On
the other hand, the investigation of two component BECs in a time dependent
harmonic trap suggests that it is possible to switch matter wave energy from
one mode to the other confirming the fact that vector BECs are long lived
compared to scalar BECs. The Feshbach resonance management of vector BECs
indicates that the two component BECs in a time dependent harmonic trap are
more stable compared to the condensates in a time independent trap. The
introduction of weak time dependent Rabi coupling rapidly compresses the bright
solitons which however can be again stabilized through Feshbach resonance or by
finetuning the Rabi coupling while the spatial coupling of vector BECs
introduces a phase difference between the condensates which subsequently can be
exploited to generate interference pattern in the bright or dark solitons.

wireless communication systems, where a large number of antennas are deployed
either being co-located at the base station (BS) or totally distributed at
separate sites called remote radio heads (RRHs). In this paper, we consider a
general antenna deployment design for wireless networks, termed multi-antenna
C-RAN, where a flexible number of antennas can be equipped at each RRH to more
effectively balance the performance and fronthaul complexity trade-off beyond
the conventional massive MIMO and single-antenna C-RAN. Under the uplink
communication setup, we propose a new ""spatial-compression-and-forward (SCF)""
scheme, where each RRH first performs a linear spatial filtering to denoise and
maximally compress its received signals from multiple users to a reduced number
of dimensions, then conducts uniform scalar quantization over each of the
resulting dimensions in parallel, and finally sends the total quantized bits to
the baseband unit (BBU) via a finite-rate fronthaul link for joint information
decoding. Under this scheme, we maximize the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of all users at the BBU by a
joint resource allocation over the wireless transmission and fronthaul links.
Specifically, each RRH determines its own spatial filtering solution in a
distributed manner to reduce the signalling overhead with the BBU, while the
BBU jointly optimizes the users' transmit power, the RRHs' fronthaul bits
allocation, and the BBU's receive beamforming with fixed spatial filters at
individual RRHs. Through numerical results, it is shown that given a total
number of antennas to be deployed, multi-antenna C-RAN with the proposed SCF
and joint optimization significantly outperforms both massive MIMO and
single-antenna C-RAN under practical fronthaul capacity constraints.

numerically solve a particular problem, to which many efforts have been
directed to accelerate the solution stage of the linear system of equations.
However, the finite element matrix construction, which is also time-consuming
for unstructured meshes, has been less investigated. The generation of the
global finite element matrix is performed in two steps, computing the local
matrices by numerical integration and assembling them into a global system,
which has traditionally been done in serial computing. This work presents a
fast technique to construct the global finite element matrix that arises by
solving the Poisson's equation in a three-dimensional domain. The proposed
methodology consists in computing the numerical integration, due to its
intrinsic parallel opportunities, in the graphics processing unit (GPU) and
computing the matrix assembly, due to its intrinsic serial operations, in the
central processing unit (CPU). In the numerical integration, only the lower
triangular part of each local stiffness matrix is computed thanks to its
symmetry, which saves GPU memory and computing time. As a result of symmetry,
the global sparse matrix also contains non-zero elements only in its lower
triangular part, which reduces the assembly operations and memory usage. This
methodology allows generating the global sparse matrix from any unstructured
finite element mesh size on GPUs with little memory capacity, only limited by
the CPU memory.

until very recently that such models are identifiable. In this paper, we
propose a new penalized least-squares esti-mator for the emission distributions
which is statistically optimal and practically tractable. We prove a non
asymptotic oracle inequality for our nonparametric estimator of the emission
distributions. A consequence is that this new estimator is rate minimax
adaptive up to a logarithmic term. Our methodology is based on projections of
the emission distributions onto nested subspaces of increasing complexity. The
popular spectral estimators are unable to achieve the optimal rate but may be
used as initial points in our procedure. Simulations are given that show the
improvement obtained when applying the least-squares minimization consecutively
to the spectral estimation.

Submitted",,,,"cs.LO cs.PL math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article, we develop a new and somewhat unexpected connection between
higher-order model-checking and linear logic. Our starting point is the
observation that once embedded in the relational semantics of linear logic, the
Church encoding of any higher-order recursion scheme (HORS) comes together with
a dual Church encoding of an alternating tree automata (ATA) of the same
signature. Moreover, the interaction between the relational interpretations of
the HORS and of the ATA identifies the set of accepting states of the tree
automaton against the infinite tree generated by the recursion scheme. We show
how to extend this result to alternating parity automata (APT) by introducing a
parametric version of the exponential modality of linear logic, capturing the
formal properties of colors (or priorities) in higher-order model-checking. We
show in particular how to reunderstand in this way the type-theoretic approach
to higher-order model-checking developed by Kobayashi and Ong. We briefly
explain in the end of the paper how his analysis driven by linear logic results
in a new and purely semantic proof of decidability of the formulas of the
monadic second-order logic for higher-order recursion schemes.

of variability during the early super-soft-source (SSS) phase. The first time
this was observed was during the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Oph
which was also extensively covered by grating observations with XMM-Newton and
Chandra. I focus here on an XMM-Newton observation taken on day 26.1, just
before Swift confirmed the start of the SSS phase, and a Chandra observation
taken on day 39.7. The first observation probes the evolution of the shock
emission produced by the collision of the nova ejecta with the stellar wind of
the companion. The second observation contains bright SSS emission longwards of
15A while at short wavelengths, the shock component can be seen to have hardly
changed. On top of the SSS continuum, additional emission lines are clearly
seen, and I show that they are much stronger than those seen on day 26.1,
indicating line pumping caused by the SSS emission. The lightcurve on day 39.7
is highly variable on short time scales while the long-term Swift light curve
was still variable. In 2007, we have shown that brightness variations are
followed by hardness variations, lagging behind 1000 seconds. I show now that
the hardness variations are owed to variations in the depth of the neutral
hydrogen column density of order 25%, particularly affecting the oxygen K-shell
ionization edge at 0.5 keV.

only mildly sensitive to the choice of parton shower and hadronization
algorithms, as well as to the effects of initial state radiation and underlying
event. In addition, the number of $k_T$ subjets of an anti-$k_T$ jet is found
to be an observable that leads to a rather uniform prediction across different
MC's, broadly being in agreement with predictions in NDLA, as compared to the

of contemporary science. A large source of difficulty comes from the fact that
the development of skills in infants results from the interactions of multiple
mechanisms at multiple spatio-temporal scales. The concepts of ""innate"" or
""acquired"" are not any more adequate tools for explanations, which call for a
shift from reductionist to systemic accounts. To address this challenge,
building and experimenting with robots modeling the growing infant brain and
body is crucial. Systemic explanations of pattern formation in sensorimotor,
cognitive and social development, viewed as a complex dynamical system, require
the use of formal models based on mathematics, algorithms and robots.
Formulating hypothesis about development using such models, and exploring them
through experiments, allows us to consider in detail the interaction between
many mechanisms and parameters. This complements traditional experimental
methods in psychology and neuroscience where only a few variables can be
studied at the same time. Furthermore, the use of robots is of particular
importance. The laws of physics generate everywhere around us spontaneous
patterns in the inorganic world. They also strongly impact the living, and in
particular constrain and guide infant development through the properties of its
(changing) body in interaction with the physical environment. Being able to
consider the body as an experimental variable, something that can be
systematically changed in order to study the impact on skill formation, has
been a dream to many developmental scientists. This is today becoming possible

whose dynamics is ruled by a Green hyperbolic partial differential operator,
can be quantized following the algebraic approach. It consists of a two-step
procedure: In the first part one identifies the observables of the underlying
physical system collecting them in a *-algebra which encodes their relational
and structural properties. In the second step one must identify a quantum
state, that is a positive, normalized linear functional on the *-algebra out of
which one recovers the interpretation proper of quantum mechanical theories via
the so-called Gelfand-Naimark-Segal theorem. In between the plethora of
possible states, only few of them are considered physically acceptable and they
are all characterized by the so-called Hadamard condition, a constraint on the
singular structure of the associated two-point function. Goal of this paper is
to outline a construction scheme for these states which can be applied whenever
the underlying background possesses a null (conformal) boundary. We discuss in
particular the examples of a real, massless conformally coupled scalar field

passive tracers in complex and biological systems. It is a highly
non-stationary process governed by the Langevin equation for Brownian motion,
however, with a power-law time dependence of the noise strength. Here we study
the aging properties of SBM for both unconfined and confined motion.
Specifically, we derive the ensemble and time averaged mean squared
displacements and analyze their behavior in the regimes of weak, intermediate,
and strong aging. A very rich behavior is revealed for confined aging SBM
depending on different aging times and whether the process is sub- or
superdiffusive. We demonstrate that the information on the aging factorizes
with respect to the lag time and exhibits a functional form, that is identical
to the aging behavior of scale free continuous time random walk processes.
While SBM exhibits a disparity between ensemble and time averaged observables
and is thus weakly non-ergodic, strong aging is shown to effect a convergence
of the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacement. Finally, we derive
the density of first passage times in the semi-infinite domain that features a
crossover defined by the aging time.

fundamental problem in compressed sensing (CS). In this paper, we study the
orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm for the recovery of support under
noise. We consider two signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings: i) the SNR depends
on the sparsity level $K$ of input signals, and ii) the SNR is an absolute
constant independent of $K$. For the first setting, we establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the exact support recovery with OMP, expressed as
lower bounds on the SNR. Our results indicate that in order to ensure the exact
support recovery of all $K$-sparse signals with the OMP algorithm, the SNR must
at least scale linearly with the sparsity level $K$. In the second setting,
since the necessary condition on the SNR is not fulfilled, the exact support
recovery with OMP is impossible. However, our analysis shows that recovery with
an arbitrarily small but constant fraction of errors is possible with the OMP
algorithm. This result may be useful for some practical applications where
obtaining some large fraction of support positions is adequate.

may be corrupted by noise, and it is a challenging problem to reliably separate
the components from one another without sacrificing significant details. Adding
to the challenge, in a compressive sensing framework, one is given only an
undersampled set of linear projections of the composite signal. In this paper,
we propose using the Dantzig selector model incorporating an overcomplete
dictionary to separate a noisy undersampled collection of composite signals,
and present an algorithm to efficiently solve the model.
  The Dantzig selector is a statistical approach to finding a solution to a
noisy linear regression problem by minimizing the $\ell_1$ norm of candidate
coefficient vectors while constraining the scope of the residuals. If the
underlying coefficient vector is sparse, then the Dantzig selector performs
well in the recovery and separation of the unknown composite signal. In the
following, we propose a proximity operator based algorithm to recover and
separate unknown noisy undersampled composite signals through the Dantzig
selector. We present numerical simulations comparing the proposed algorithm
with the competing Alternating Direction Method, and the proposed algorithm is
found to be faster, while producing similar quality results. Additionally, we
demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm in several experiments by
applying it in various domain applications including the recovery of
complex-valued coefficient vectors, the removal of impulse noise from smooth
signals, and the separation and classification of a composition of handwritten
digits.

chemical abundances in physical conditions corresponding to starless cores. To
this end, we have developed new chemical reaction sets for both gas-phase and
grain-surface chemistry, including the deuterated forms of species with up to
six atoms and the spin-state chemistry of light ions and of the species
involved in the ammonia and water formation networks. The physical model is
kept simple in order to facilitate straightforward benchmarking of other models
against the results of this paper. Results. We find that the ortho/para ratios
of ammonia and water are similar in both gas-phase and gas-grain models, at
late times in particular, implying that the ratios are determined by gas-phase
processes. We derive late-time ortho/para ratios of ~0.5 and ~1.6 for ammonia

calculations has little effect on the abundances of non-deuterated species and
on the ortho/para ratios of ammonia and water, especially in gas-phase models
where deuteration is naturally hindered owing to the presence of abundant heavy
elements. Although we study a rather narrow temperature range (10-20 K), we
find strong temperature dependence in, e.g., deuteration and nitrogen
chemistry. For example, the depletion timescale of ammonia is significantly
reduced when the temperature is increased from 10 to 20 K; this is because the
increase in temperature translates into increased accretion rates, while the

logic. Its formulas are pairs of conjunctions of positive literals, related
together by an implicational-like connective; the semantics of this sort of
implication is defined in terms of a threshold on a conditional probability of
the consequent, given the antecedent: we are dealing with what the data
analysis community calls confidence of partial implications or association
rules. Existing studies of redundancy among these partial implications have
characterized so far only entailment from one premise and entailment from two
premises, both in the stand-alone case and in the case of presence of
additional classical implications (this is what we call ""relative entailment"").
By exploiting a previously noted alternative view of the entailment in terms of
linear programming duality, we characterize exactly the cases of entailment
from arbitrary numbers of premises, again both in the stand-alone case and in
the case of presence of additional classical implications. As a result, we
obtain decision algorithms of better complexity; additionally, for each
potential case of entailment, we identify a critical confidence threshold and
show that it is, actually, intrinsic to each set of premises and antecedent of
the conclusion.

studied extensively in several settings. In computability theory the notion of
encoding is crucial for defining computability on arbitrary domains, as well as
for comparing the power of models of computation. In language theory much
attention has been devoted to regularity preserving functions.
  A natural question arising in these contexts is: Is there a bijective
encoding such that its image function preserves regularity of languages, but
its pre-image function does not? Our main result answers this question in the
affirmative: For every countable class C of languages there exists a bijective
encoding f such that for every language L in C its image f[L] is regular.
  Our construction of such encodings has several noteworthy consequences.
Firstly, anomalies arise when models of computation are compared with respect
to a known concept of implementation that is based on encodings which are not
required to be computable: Every countable decision model can be implemented,
in this sense, by finite-state automata, even via bijective encodings. Hence
deterministic finite-state automata would be equally powerful as Turing machine
deciders.
  A second consequence concerns the recognizability of sets of natural numbers
via number representations and finite automata. A set of numbers is said to be
recognizable with respect to a representation if an automaton accepts the
language of representations. Our result entails that there is one number
representation with respect to which every recursive set is recognizable.

applied the method to galaxies at 0.2<z<1.0, and found that most of passively

temperature of Tdust > 20 K, for which the formation efficiency of molecular
hydrogen on the surface of dust grains in the diffuse ISM is expected to be
very low from the laboratory experiments. The fraction of passively evolving
galaxies strongly depends on the expected dust temperature at all redshifts and
increases rapidly with increasing the temperature around Tdust ~ 20 K. These
results suggest that the dust heating by low-mass stars in massive galaxies

peaks at the location of the IRAS source. The near-infrared images reveal,
additionally, the presence of nebular emission with rich morphological

interaction among the species are much sensitive to the system parameters and
initial population volume. The ranges of the significant parameters under which
the system admits a Hopf bifurcation are investigated. The explicit formulae

such as eCommerce, privacy of information is becoming a critical issue. Today,
many online companies are gathering information and have assembled
sophisticated databases that know a great deal about many people, generally
without the knowledge of those people. Such information changes hands or
ownership as a normal part of eCommerce transactions, or through strategic
decisions that often includes the sale of users' information to other firms.
The key commercial value of users' personal information derives from the
ability of firms to identify consumers and charge them personalized prices for
goods and services they have previously used or may wish to use in the future.
A look at present-day practices reveals that consumers' profile data is now
considered as one of the most valuable assets owned by online businesses. In
this thesis, we argue the following: if consumers' private data is such a
valuable asset, should they not be entitled to commercially benefit from their
asset as well? The scope of this thesis is on developing architecture for
privacy payoff as a means of rewarding consumers for sharing their personal
information with online businesses. The architecture is a multi-agent system in
which several agents employ various requirements for personal information
valuation and interaction capabilities that most users cannot do on their own.
The agents in the system bear the responsibility of working on behalf of
consumers to categorize their personal data objects, report to consumers on
online businesses' trustworthiness and reputation, determine the value of their
compensation using risk-based financial models, and, finally, negotiate for a
payoff value in return for the dissemination of users' information.

connect two boundaries without null points, with emphasis on localized finite-B
magnetic reconnection. Total (relative) magnetic helicity is already recognized
as an important topological constraint on magnetohydrodynamic processes. Field
line helicity offers further advantages because it preserves all topological
information and can distinguish between different magnetic fields with the same
total helicity. Magnetic reconnection changes field connectivity and field line
helicity reflects these changes; the goal of this paper is to characterize that
evolution. We start by deriving the evolution equation for field line helicity
and examining its terms, also obtaining a simplified form for cases where
dynamics are localized within the domain. The main result, which we support
using kinematic examples, is that during localized reconnection in a complex
magnetic field, the evolution of field line helicity is dominated by a
work-like term that is evaluated at the field line endpoints, namely the scalar
product of the generalized field line velocity and the vector potential.
Furthermore, the flux integral of this term over certain areas is very small
compared to the integral of the unsigned quantity, which indicates that changes
of field line helicity happen in a well-organized pairwise manner. It follows
that reconnection is very efficient at redistributing helicity in complex
magnetic fields despite having little effect on the total helicity.

low-dimensionnal acoustic features typically used in MIR frameworks. Several
issues prevent this task to be straightforwardly achieved. Such features are
designed for analysis and not for synthesis, thus favoring high-level
description over easily inverted acoustic representation. Whereas some previous
studies already considered the problem of synthesizing audio from features such
as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, they mainly relied on the explicit
formula used to compute those features in order to inverse them. Here, we
instead adopt a simple blind approach, where arbitrary sets of features can be
used during synthesis and where reconstruction is exemplar-based. After testing
the approach on a speech synthesis from well known features problem, we apply
it to the more complex task of inverting songs from the Million Song Dataset.
What makes this task harder is twofold. First, that features are irregularly
spaced in the temporal domain according to an onset-based segmentation. Second
the exact method used to compute these features is unknown, although the
features for new audio can be computed using their API as a black-box. In this
paper, we detail these difficulties and present a framework to nonetheless
attempting such synthesis by concatenating audio samples from a training
dataset, whose features have been computed beforehand. Samples are selected at
the segment level, in the feature space with a simple nearest neighbor search.
Additionnal constraints can then be defined to enhance the synthesis
pertinence. Preliminary experiments are presented using RWC and GTZAN audio
datasets to synthesize tracks from the Million Song Dataset.

symmetric monoidal categories. We generalise the necessary tools of
representation theory from fdHilb to arbitrary dagger symmetric monoidal

their relation to strong complementarity. The Fourier transform is then defined
in terms of pairs of strongly complementary observables, in both the abelian

Pontryagin duality and provide categorical proofs of the Fourier Inversion
Theorem, the Convolution Theory, and Pontryagin duality. Our work finds
application in the novel characterisation of the Fourier transform for the

the study of categorical quantum algorithms, as the usual construction of the
quantum Fourier transform in terms of Fourier matrices is shown to fail in
fRel. Despite this, the process theoretic perspective on the Fourier transform
is sensible in this setting. Furthermore, our categorical setting provides a
generalisation of the abelian Fourier transform from finite-dimensional Hilbert

that the level of complexity in the foreground models used to fit global 21-cm
data should be driven by the data, under a Bayesian model selection
methodology. A first test of this approach is carried out by applying nested
sampling to simplified models of global 21-cm data to compute the Bayesian
evidence for the models. If the foregrounds are assumed to be polynomials of
order n in log-log space, we can infer the necessity to use n=4 rather than n=3
with <2h of integration with limited frequency coverage, for reasonable values
of the n=4 coefficient.
  Using a higher-order polynomial does not necessarily prevent a significant
detection of the 21-cm signal. Even for n=8, we can obtain very strong evidence
distinguishing a reasonable model for the signal from a null model with 128h of
integration. More subtle features of the signal may, however, be lost if the
foregrounds are this complex. This is demonstrated using a simpler model for
the signal that only includes absorption.
  The results highlight some pitfalls in trying to quantify the significance of
a detection from errors on the parameters of the signal alone.

production plant in mind that involves stochastically varying production and
transportation costs both from the site to the plant as well as from the plant
to the customer base, this article proves that the producer may benefit through
better outlay in the form of higher sale prices with lowered optimized
production costs only through a suitable selective choice of producers whose
production cost probability density function abides a Pareto distribution.
Lower the Pareto exponent, better is the supply chain prediction for cost
optimization. On the other hand, other symmetric (normal) and asymmetric
(lognormal) distributions lead to upscaled costs both in terms of inlays and
outlays. While this is an averaged out statistics over large time regimes,
transient features may still affect such probabilistic predictions and offset

constitute extremely powerful probes of the ionized Inter-Galactic Medium
(IGM), intergalactic magnetic fields, and the properties of space-time itself.
Their dispersion measures (DMs) will enable us to detect the ""missing"" baryons
in the low-redshift Universe and make the first measurements of the mean galaxy
halo profile, a key parameter in models of galaxy formation and feedback.
Impulsive bursts can be used as cosmic rulers at redshifts exceeding 2, and
constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w(z)$ at redshifts
beyond those readily accessible by Type Ia SNe. Both of these goals are
realisable with a sample of $\sim 10^4$ fast radio bursts (FRBs) whose
positions are localized to within one arcsecond, sufficient to obtain host
galaxy redshifts via optical follow-up. It is also hypothesised that
gravitational wave events may emit coherent emission at frequencies probed by
SKA1-LOW, and the localization of such events at cosmological distances would
enable their use as cosmological standard sirens.
  To perform this science, such bursts must be localized to their specific host
galaxies so that their redshifts may be obtained and compared against their
dispersion measures, rotation measures, and scattering properties. The SKA can
achieve this with a design that has a wide field-of-view, a substantial
fraction of its collecting area in a compact configuration (80\% within a 3\,km
radius), and a capacity to attach high-time-resolution instrumentation to its
signal path.

be stochastically perturbed by exogenous factors. Both thermodynamic
(equilibrium) and time varying (non-steady state) properties of a landfill are
affected by spatially heterogenous and nonlinear subprocesses that combine with
constraining initial and boundary conditions arising from the associated
surroundings. While multiple approaches have been made to model landfill
statistics by incorporating spatially dependent parameters on the one hand
(data based approach) and continuum dynamical mass-balance equations on the
other (equation based modelling), practically no attempt has been made to
amalgamate these two approaches while also incorporating inherent
stochastically induced fluctuations affecting the process overall. In this
article, we will implement a minimalist scheme of modelling the time evolution
of a realistic three dimensional landfill through a reaction-diffusion based
approach, focusing on the coupled interactions of four key variables - solid
mass density, hydrolysed mass density, acetogenic mass density and methanogenic
mass density. In a marked departure from previous predictions, our results
indicate that close to the linearly stable limit, the large time steady state
properties, arising out of a series of complex coupled interactions between the
stochastically driven variables, are scarcely affected by the biochemical
growth-decay statistics. Our results clearly show that an equilibrium landfill
structure relates to plant production times of approximately 20-30 years
instead of the previous (incorrect) deterministic model predictions of 50 years
and above.

rotary elastic disc on a hard and rough surface under different rotating
conditions. A one dimensional spring- mass rotary system is numerically solved
under the quasistatic condition with the rate and state dependent friction
model. It is established that torque of frictional strength as well as torque
of steady dynamic stress increases with radius and found to be maximum at the
periphery of the disc. Torque corresponding to frictional strength estimated
using the analytical solution matches closely with the simulation only in the
case of high stiffness of the connecting spring. In steady relaxation
simulation, a steadily rotating disc is suddenly stopped and relaxational
angular velocity and corresponding frictional torque decreases with both steady
angular velocity and stiffness of the connecting spring in the velocity
strengthening regime. In velocity weakening regime, in contrast, torque of
relaxation stress deceases but relaxation velocity increases. The reason for
the contradiction is explained.

time in a wide luminosity range (1-40)x10^{37} erg/s during a giant outburst
observed by the RXTE observatory in Dec 2004 - Feb 2005. We characterize the
spectra quantitatively and built the detailed ""three-dimensional"" picture of
spectral variations with pulse phase and throughout the outburst. We show that
all spectral parameters are strongly variable with the pulse phase, and the
pattern of this variability significantly changes with luminosity directly
reflecting the associated changes in the structure of emission regions and
their beam patterns. Obtained results are qualitatively discussed in terms of
the recently developed reflection model for the formation of cyclotron lines in
the spectra of X-ray pulsars.
