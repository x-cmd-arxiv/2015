depicting flux distributions on networks in the steady state of an open flow
system. Energetic food webs, economic input-output networks, and international
trade networks, are open flow network models of energy flows between species,
money or value flows between industrial sectors, and goods flows between
countries, respectively. Flow distances (first-passage or total) between any
given two nodes $i$ and $j$ are defined as the average number of transition
steps of a random walker along the network from $i$ to $j$ under some
conditions. They apparently deviate from the conventional random walk distance
on a closed directed graph because they consider the openness of the flow
network. Flow distances are explicitly expressed by underlying Markov matrix of
a flow system in this paper. With this novel theoretical conception, we can
visualize open flow networks, calculating centrality of each node, and
clustering nodes into groups. We apply flow distances to two kinds of empirical
open flow networks, including energetic food webs and economic input-output
network. In energetic food webs example, we visualize the trophic level of each
species and compare flow distances with other distance metrics on graph. In
input-output network, we rank sectors according to their average distances away
other sectors, and cluster sectors into different groups. Some other potential
applications and mathematical properties are also discussed. To summarize, flow
distance is a useful and powerful tool to study open flow systems.

Hopf algebra (i.e. it is endowed with a so-called antipode) then every Hopf
module $M$ is of the form ${M}^{\mathrm{co}{H}}\otimes H$, where
${M}^{\mathrm{co}{H}}$ denotes the space of coinvariant elements in $M$.
Actually, it has been shown that this result characterizes Hopf algebras: $H$
is a Hopf algebra if and only if every Hopf module $M$ can be decomposed in
such a way. The main aim of this paper is to extend this characterization to
the framework of quasi-bialgebras by introducing the notion of preantipode and
by proving a Structure Theorem for quasi-Hopf bimodules. We will also establish
the uniqueness of the preantipode and the closure of the family of
quasi-bialgebras with preantipode under gauge transformation. Then, we will
prove that every Hopf and quasi-Hopf algebra (i.e. a quasi-bialgebra with
quasi-antipode) admits a preantipode and we will show how some previous
results, as the Structure Theorem for Hopf modules, the Hausser-Nill theorem
and the Bulacu-Caenepeel theorem for quasi-Hopf algebras, can be deduced from
our Structure Theorem. Furthermore, we will investigate the relationship
between the preantipode and the quasi-antipode and we will study a number of
cases in which the two notions are equivalent: ordinary bialgebras endowed with
trivial reassociator, commutative quasi-bialgebras, finite-dimensional
quasi-bialgebras.

$20^{\circ} < l < 40^{\circ}$. Through the subtraction of a radio recombination

theories obtained by wrapping M5-branes on a punctured Riemann surface. The
internal geometry, normal to the AdS5 factor, generically preserves two U(1)s,
with generators (J+,J-), that are fibered over the Riemann surface. The metric
is governed by a single potential that satisfies a version of the Monge-Ampere
equation. The spectrum of N=1 punctures is given by the set of supersymmetric
sources of the potential that are localized on the Riemann surface and lead to
regular metrics near a puncture. We use this system to study a class of
punctures where the geometry near the sources corresponds to M-theory
description of D6-branes. These carry a natural (p,q) label associated to the
circle dual to the killing vector (p J+ + q J-) which shrinks near the source.
In the generic case the world volume of the D6-branes is AdS5 X S^2 and they
locally preserve N=2 supersymmetry. When p=-q, the shrinking circle is dual to
a flavor U(1). The metric in this case is non-degenerate only when there are
co-dimension one sources, M9-branes, obtained by smearing M5-branes that wrap
the AdS5 factor and the circle dual the superconformal R-symmetry. In the IIA
limit, they can interpreted as D8-branes. The D6-branes are extended along the
AdS5 and on cups that end on the co-dimension one branes. In the special case
when the shrinking circle is dual to the R-symmetry, the D6-branes are extended
along the AdS5 and wrap an auxiliary Riemann surface with an arbitrary genus.
When the Riemann surface is compact with constant curvature, the system is
governed by a Monge-Ampere equation.

length $N$. Although, the complexity bound of $N \log N$ is asymptotically
favorable, we report in this work methods to further reduce the encoding and
decoding complexities of polar coding. The crux is to relax the polarization of
certain bit-channels without performance degradation. We consider schemes for
relaxing the polarization of both \emph{very good} and \emph{very bad}

proved to preserve the capacity achieving property of polar codes. Analytical
bounds on the asymptotic and finite-length complexity reduction attainable by
relaxed polarization are derived.

reduced by a factor of 6, while preserving the rate and error performance. We
also show that relaxed polar codes can be decoded with significantly reduced

probabilistic rules (or ""action syntax""). The patterns of vocal elements in
birdsong are a prime example. The encoding of such rules in neural circuits is
poorly understood. Here we locate the site of song syntax in the Bengalese
finch by rapidly and reversibly manipulating the temperature in the song
production pathway. Changing the temperature in the premotor nucleus HVC
(proper name) alters the transition probabilities between syllables. Most
prominently, cooling reduces the number of repetitions of long repeated
syllables, while heating increases repetition. In contrast, changing the
temperature of the downstream motor area RA (robust nucleus of the
acropallium), which is critical for singing, does not affect the song syntax.
Computational modeling suggests that temperature can alter the transition
probabilities by affecting the efficacy of the synapses in HVC that carry
auditory feedback to the motor circuits. The model is supported by a real-time
distorted auditory feedback experiment, which shows that perturbing auditory
feedback shortens syllable repeats similar to cooling HVC. Taken together,
these findings implicate HVC as a key player in determining birdsong syntax.

using the chain rule of derivatives. Such modularity offers a clear separation
of case-specific components (base distribution functional form and link
functions) from common steps (e.g., matrix algebra operations needed for
expansion) in calculating log-likelihood derivatives. In doing so,
RegressionFactory offers several advantages: 1) It provides a fast and
convenient method for constructing log-likelihood and its derivatives by
requiring only the low-dimensional, base-distribution derivatives, 2) The
accompanying definiteness-invariance theorem allows researchers to reason about
the negative-definiteness of the log-likelihood Hessian in the much
lower-dimensional space of the base distributions, 3) The factorized, abstract
view of regression suggests opportunities to generate novel regression models,
and 4) Computational techniques for performance optimization can be developed
generically in the abstract framework and be readily applicable across all the
specific regression instances. We expect RegressionFactory to facilitate
research and development on optimization and sampling techniques for GLM
log-likelihoods as well as construction of composite models from GLM lego

image under a bilinear mapping, arise in many applications. Without further
constraints, BIPs are usually ill-posed. In practice, properties of natural
signals are exploited to solve BIPs. For example, subspace constraints or
sparsity constraints are imposed to reduce the search space. These approaches
have shown some success in practice. However, there are few results on
uniqueness in BIPs. For most BIPs, the fundamental question of under what
condition the problem admits a unique solution, is yet to be answered. For
example, blind gain and phase calibration (BGPC) is a structured bilinear
inverse problem, which arises in many applications, including inverse rendering
in computational relighting (albedo estimation with unknown lighting), blind
phase and gain calibration in sensor array processing, and multichannel blind
deconvolution (MBD). It is interesting to study the uniqueness of such
problems.
  In this paper, we define identifiability of a BIP up to a group of
transformations. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for such
identifiability, i.e., the conditions under which the solutions can be uniquely
determined up to the transformation group. Applying these results to BGPC, we
derive sufficient conditions for unique recovery under several scenarios,
including subspace, joint sparsity, and sparsity models. For BGPC with joint
sparsity or sparsity constraints, we develop a procedure to compute the
relevant transformation groups. We also give necessary conditions in the form
of tight lower bounds on sample complexities, and demonstrate the tightness of
these bounds by numerical experiments. The results for BGPC not only
demonstrate the application of the proposed general framework for
identifiability analysis, but are also of interest in their own right.

characterization, i.e. degree of freedom (DOF) at high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), we focus on the other practical performance metrics, namely outage
probability, ergodic rate and symbol error rate (SER). In particular, we
consider imperfect IA due to the fact that the transmitters usually have only
imperfect channel state information (CSI) in practical scenario. By
characterizing the impact of imperfect CSI, we derive the exact closed-form
expressions of outage probability, ergodic rate and SER in terms of CSI
accuracy, transmit SNR, channel condition, number of antennas, and the number
of data streams of each communication pair. Furthermore, we obtain some
important guidelines for performance optimization of IA under imperfect CSI by
minimizing the performance loss over IA with perfect CSI. Finally, our
theoretical claims are validated by simulation results.

galactic nuclei, and their implications for the accretion in those sources. We
show that the models that account for broad-band spectra of blazars emitting in
the GeV range in the sample of Boettcher et al. have highly super-Eddington jet
powers. Furthermore, the ratio of the jet power to the radiative luminosity of
the accretion disc is $\sim 3000$ on average and can be as high as $\sim 10^5$.
We then show that the measurements of the radio core shift for the sample imply
low magnetic fluxes threading the black hole, which rules out the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism to produce powerful jets. These results require that
the accretion rate necessary to power the modelled jets is extremely high, and
the average radiative accretion efficiency is $\sim 4 \times 10^{-5}$. Thus, if
the hadronic model is correct, the currently prevailing picture of accretion in
AGNs needs to be significantly revised. Also, the obtained accretion mode
cannot be dominant during the lifetimes of the sources, as the modelled very
high accretion rates would result in too rapid growth of the central
supermassive black holes. Finally, the extreme jet powers in the hadronic model
are in conflict with the estimates of the jet power by other methods.

potentially moving, uncalibrated camera. The pedestrians are located in each
frame using a standard human detector, which are then tracked in subsequent
frames. This is a challenging problem as one has to deal with complex
situations like changing background, partial or full occlusion and camera
motion. In order to carry out successful tracking, it is necessary to resolve
associations between the detected windows in the current frame with those
obtained from the previous frame. Compared to methods that use temporal windows
incorporating past as well as future information, we attempt to make decision
on a frame-by-frame basis. An occlusion reasoning scheme is proposed to resolve
the association problem between a pair of consecutive frames by using an
affinity matrix that defines the closeness between a pair of windows and then,
uses a binary integer programming to obtain unique association between them. A
second stage of verification based on SURF matching is used to deal with those
cases where the above optimization scheme might yield wrong associations. The
efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through experiments on several
standard pedestrian datasets.

from incomplete information and can we achieve full localization of sources at

dynamics as typical dynamical processes and apply it to the H1N1 pandemic in

  Superconducting Oxides","revised version",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It seems that the remarkable properties of the high temperature
superconducting oxides, especially the Insulator-Metal Transition (IMT) and the
Metal-Superconductor Transition (MST) both originate from the competition
(interplay) between ionic versus in-plane covalence nature of bonds in these
materials. As a result of this competition, the microscopic order parameter,
that is firmly identified to be the local field estimated from the ionic
polarization at the sub-unit level (one half of the unit cell), shows a strong
temperature as well as chemical doping dependence. While the out-of-plane
ionicity is responsible for the interlayer charge transfer (electrons) that
reduces it leading to IMT, the in-plane covalency is responsible for the
in-plane intersite transfer of charge (holes) that increases the ionicity and
leads to MST. This interplay of charge transfer, driven by the out-of-plane
ionicity and the in-plane covalency, leads at the critical temperature Tc to a
local field avalanche (ionic polarization catastrophe at the sub-unit cell
level) that triggers an out-of-plane correlation between the local polarization
fields at the unit cell and drives the compound into the superconducting state.
The asymmetry of the free charge carrier density breaks locally the inversion
symmetry of the order parameter leading to an unconventional pairing mechanism
characterized by the CPT transformation where C is the charge conjugation
symmetry, P is the parity symmetry and T is the time reversal symmetry. It is
established that the out-of-plane ionicity versus in-plane covalency is a
necessary condition for the occurrence of both IMT and MST. The underlined
microscopic mechanism provides a route to a possible unified description of
high-Tc superconductivity.

  kinetics of a fluctuating enzyme","27 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent fluorescence spectroscopy measurements of the turnover time
distribution of single-enzyme turnover kinetics of $\beta$-galactosidase
provide evidence of Michaelis-Menten kinetics at low substrate concentration.
However, at high substrate concentrations, the dimensionless variance of the
turnover time distribution shows systematic deviations from the
Michaelis-Menten prediction. This difference is attributed to conformational
fluctuations in both the enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex and to the
possibility of both parallel and off-pathway kinetics. Here, we use the
chemical master equation to model the kinetics of a single fluctuating enzyme
that can yield a product through either parallel or off-pathway mechanisms. An
exact expression is obtained for the turnover time distribution from which the
mean turnover time and randomness parameters are calculated. The parallel and
off-pathway mechanisms yield strikingly different dependences of the mean
turnover time and the randomness parameter on the substrate concentration. In
the parallel mechanism, the distinct contributions of enzyme and
enzyme-substrate fluctuations are clearly discerned from the variation of the
randomness parameter with substrate concentration. From these general results
we conclude that an off-pathway mechanism, with substantial enzyme-substrate
fluctuations, is needed to rationalize the experimental findings of
single-enzyme turnover kinetics of $\beta$-galactosidase.

depleted stocks sometimes show little or no recovery over a long time period.
Here, using a mathematical model, we show that multiple stable states may hold
the key to understanding the tendency for fisheries stocks to recover because
of MPAs. We find that MPAs can have either a positive effect or almost no
effect on the recovery of depleted fishing stocks, depending on the fish
migration patterns and the fishing policies. MPAs also reinforce ecological
resilience, particularly for migratory species. In contrast to previous
reports, our results show that MPAs have small or sometimes negative effects on
the recovery of sedentary species. Unsuitable MPA planning might result in low

edge is the distance between the incident nodes of that edge. Serving a request
requires unit time. We characterize the competitive ratio for each metric space
separately. The competitive ratio depends on the relation between the minimum
laxity (the minimum length of a time window) and the diameter of the metric
space. Specifically, there is a constant competitive algorithm depending
whether the laxity is larger or smaller than the diameter. In addition, we
characterize the rate of convergence of the competitive ratio to $1$ as the
laxity increases. Specifically, we provide a matching lower and upper bounds
depending on the ratio between the laxity and the TSP of the metric space (the
minimum distance to traverse all nodes). An application of our result improves
the lower bound for colored packets with transition cost and matches the upper
bound. In proving our lower bounds we use an interesting non-standard embedding

notions that are close to each other but also exclude one another. I adopt the
conception of duality as 'isomorphism', cashing it out in terms of three
conditions. These three conditions prompt two conceptually different ways in
which a duality can be modified to make room for emergence; and I argue that
this exhausts the possibilities for combining dualities and emergence (via
coarse-graining).
  I apply this framework to gauge/gravity dualities, considering in detail
three examples: AdS/CFT, Verlinde's scheme, and black holes. My main point
about gauge/gravity dualities is that the theories involved, qua theories of
gravity, must be background-independent. I distinguish two senses of
background-independence: (i) minimalistic and (ii) extended. The former is
sufficiently strong to allow for a consistent theory of quantum gravity; and
AdS/CFT is background-independent on this account; while Verlinde's scheme best
fits the extended sense. I argue that this extended sense should be applied
with some caution: on pain of throwing the baby (general relativity) out with
the bath-water (extended background-independence). Nevertheless, it is an
interesting and potentially fruitful heuristic principle for quantum gravity
theory construction. The interpretation of dualities is articulated in terms
of: (i) epistemic and metaphysical commitments; (ii) parts vs. wholes.
  I then analyse the emergence of gravity in gauge/gravity dualities in terms
of the two available conceptualisations of emergence; and I show how emergence
in AdS/CFT and in Verlinde's scenario differ from each other. Finally, I give a
novel derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy formula based on
Verlinde's scheme; the derivation sheds light on several aspects of Verlinde's
scheme and how it compares to Bekenstein's original calculation.

  (ISIT) 2015. 29 pages, 12 figures, submitted to journal publication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key practical constraint on the design of Hybrid automatic repeat request
(HARQ) schemes is the size of the on-chip buffer that is available at the
receiver to store previously received packets. In fact, in modern wireless
standards such as LTE and LTE-A, the HARQ buffer size is one of the main
drivers of the modem area and power consumption. This has recently highlighted
the importance of HARQ buffer management, that is, of the use of buffer-aware
transmission schemes and of advanced compression policies for the storage of
received data. This work investigates HARQ buffer management by leveraging
information-theoretic achievability arguments based on random coding.
Specifically, standard HARQ schemes, namely Type-I, Chase Combining and
Incremental Redundancy, are first studied under the assumption of a
finite-capacity HARQ buffer by considering both coded modulation, via Gaussian
signaling, and Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM). The analysis sheds
light on the impact of different compression strategies, namely the
conventional compression log-likelihood ratios and the direct digitization of
baseband signals, on the throughput. Then, coding strategies based on layered
modulation and optimized coding blocklength are investigated, highlighting the
benefits of HARQ buffer-aware transmission schemes. The optimization of
baseband compression for multiple-antenna links is also studied, demonstrating
the optimality of a transform coding approach.

objects from a noisy image collection with multiple object classes. The setting
of this problem is fully unsupervised, without even image-level annotations or
any assumption of a single dominant class. This is far more general than
typical colocalization, cosegmentation, or weakly-supervised localization
tasks. We tackle the discovery and localization problem using a part-based
region matching approach: We use off-the-shelf region proposals to form a set
of candidate bounding boxes for objects and object parts. These regions are
efficiently matched across images using a probabilistic Hough transform that
evaluates the confidence for each candidate correspondence considering both
appearance and spatial consistency. Dominant objects are discovered and
localized by comparing the scores of candidate regions and selecting those that
stand out over other regions containing them. Extensive experimental
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach
significantly outperforms the current state of the art in colocalization, and
achieves robust object discovery in challenging mixed-class datasets.

unicellular to multicellular organisms. Here we develop non-robust models
provided in [1] and attempt to get robust models investigated how
differentiation of types and energy constraints influence on the optimal
behavior of colonies with different size. Constructed models show that each
large-sized colony with high initial costs of reproduction tends to full
specialization, no matter are all cells in this colony identical or are there
cells with different types in this colony. The level of type's diversity
determines the number of cells specialized in soma. In small - sized colonies
with low initial costs of reproduction, when type's diversity is week, an
unspecialized state may bring colony some benefits. However, these benefits may
be only local and in optimum in the colony some cells would be specialized,
others - unspecialized. The amount of specialized cells in small - sized colony
depends on the level of type's diversity in this colony. Adding energy
constraint, we may receive robust models even in convex case. In optimum, the
colony with different types of cells and energy restriction may be indifferent
between some optimal patterns of states. Arbitrary chosen cell may be soma or
germ in some states or may be unspecialized in other. Moreover, in each optimal
state levels of fecundity and viability of each cell lie in limited ranges.
This result reflects the fact that some cell in the colony may lose the
potential ability to achieve, for example, high level of fecundity, but does
not lose the possibility to perform a reproductive function at all. It means
that provided model can describe organisms, which represents the intermediate
between unspecialized colonies and full-specialized multicellular organisms.
