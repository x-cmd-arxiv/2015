complex multi-agent systems using fixed-order non-fragile dynamic output
feedback controller, via an LMI approach. The proposed scheme is decentralized
in the sense that each agent relies on the relative output information among
the adjacent agents. The consensus based controllers are designed to minimize
the effects of nonlinear terms of the agents as well as external disturbances.
Converting consensus problem to stabilization of an equivalent augmented system
using proper transformations, Lyapunov stability theorem is applied to obtain
unknown controller parameters in order to guarantee consensus and
simultaneously acquire considered control objectives. Finally, to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and compare with similar earlier
researches, a numerical example on a multi-agent system consisting of single
link flexible manipulators is carried out.

planar lattice models. One reason why this topic occupies an important place in
the theory of probability and mathematical statistical physics is that scaling
limits provide the link between statistical mechanics and (Euclidean) field
theory. In order to explain the main ideas behind the concept of scaling limit,
I will focus on a ""toy"" model that exhibits the typical behavior of statistical
mechanical models at and near the critical point. This model, known as the
random walk loop soup, is actually interesting in its own right. It can be
described as a Poissonian ensemble of lattice loops, or a lattice gas of loops
since it fits within the ideal gas framework of statistical mechanics. After
introducing the model and discussing some interesting connections with the
discrete Gaussian free field, I will present some results concerning its
scaling limit, which leads to a Poissonian ensemble of continuum loops known as
the Brownian loop soup. The latter was introduced by Lawler and Werner and is a
very interesting object with connections to the Schramm-Loewner Evolution and
various models of statistical mechanics. In the second part of the lectures, I
will use the Brownian loop soup to construct a family of functions that behave
like correlation functions of a conformal field. I will then use these
functions and their derivation to introduce the concept of conformal field and
to explore the connection between scaling limits and conformal fields.

classifiers are cascaded along a chain, thus taking into account inter-label

classifier chain methods have been introduced, and many of them perform very
competitively across a wide range of benchmark datasets. However, scalability

on standard multi-label problems, yet it can also scale up to thousands or even
tens of thousands of labels.

nanosphere in water in the thermoelastic regime. Specifically, we consider the
long-pulse illumination regime, in which the time for electron-phonon
thermalisation can be neglected and photoacoustic wave generation arises solely
from the thermo-elastic stress caused by the temperature increase of the
nanosphere or its liquid environment. Photoacoustic signals are predicted
computed based on the successive resolution of a thermal diffusion problem and
a thermoelastic problem, taking into account the finite size of the gold
nanosphere and the temperature-dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient
of water. For sufficiently high illumination fluences, this temperature
dependence yields a nonlinear relationship between the photoacoustic amplitude
and the fluence. For nanosecond pulses in the linear regime, we show that more
than 90 % of the emitted photoacoustic energy is generated in water, and the
thickness of the generating layer around the particle scales close to the
square root of the pulse duration. Our results demonstrate that the
point-absorber model introduced by Calasso et al.[17] significantly
overestimates the amplitude of photoacoustic waves in the nonlinear regime. We
therefore provide quantitative estimates of a critical energy, defined as the
absorbed energy required such that the nonlinear contribution is equal to that
of the linear contribution. Our results suggest that the critical energy scales
as the volume of water over which heat diffuses during the illumination pulse.
Moreover, thermal nonlinearity is shown to be expected only for sufficiently
high ultrasound frequency. Finally, we show that the relationship between the
photoacoustic amplitude and the equilibrium temperature at sufficiently high
fluence reflects the thermal diffusion at the nanoscale around the gold
nanosphere.

discussed. Due to the straight nature of most modern detectors geometrical
defocusing occurs which heavily influences the line shape of diffraction lines
at low angles. An easy approach to limit the resolution degrading effects is
presented. The presented algorithm selects an adaptive range of channels of the
linear detector at low angles, resulting in increased resolution. At higher
angles still the whole linear detector is used and the data collection remains
fast. Using this algorithm a well-behaved resolution function is obtained in
the full angular range, whereas using the full linear detector the resolution
function varies within one pattern which hinders line shape and Rietveld

crystallographic symmetry provides a robust approach to characterizing
medium-range order (and disorder) and symmetry breaking in complex and

information in a symmetry-adapted basis set that is most descriptive of the

favors the destabilization of the constant steady state and the mechanism of

in Madzvamuse et al. (J. Math. Biol. 2014). Since the subcritical Turing
bifurcations of reaction-diffusion systems lead to spontaneous onset of robust,
finite-amplitude localized patterns, here a detailed investigation of the
Turing pattern forming region is performed to show how the diffusion
coefficients for both species (the activator and the inhibitor) influence the
occurrence of supercritical or subcritical bifurcations. The weakly nonlinear
(WNL) multiple scales analysis is employed to derive the equations for the
amplitude of the Turing patterns and to distinguish the supercritical and the
subcritical pattern region, both in 1D and 2D domains. Numerical simulations
are employed to confirm the WNL theoretical predictions through which a
classification of the patterns (squares, rhombi, rectangle and hexagons) is
obtained. In particular, due to the hysteretic nature of the subcritical
bifurcation, we observe the phenomenon of pattern transition from rolls to
hexagons, in agreement with the bifurcation diagram.

the limiting resource, peaky and non-peaky signaling schemes have long been

reaches a peak rate at some finite critical bandwidth and then falls to zero as
bandwidth grows to infinity. In this paper it is shown that this distinction is
in fact an artifact of the limited attention paid in the past to the product
between the bandwidth and the fraction of time it is in use. This fundamental
quantity, called bandwidth occupancy, measures average bandwidth usage over
time. For all signaling schemes with the same bandwidth occupancy, achievable
rates approach to the wideband AWGN capacity within the same gap as the
bandwidth occupancy approaches its critical value, and decrease to zero as the
occupancy goes to infinity. This unified analysis produces quantitative
closed-form expressions for the ideal bandwidth occupancy, recovers the
existing capacity results for (non-)peaky signaling schemes, and unveils a
trade-off between the accuracy of approximating capacity with a generalized
Taylor polynomial and the accuracy with which the optimal bandwidth occupancy
can be bounded.

perturbed Friedmann-Lema\^itre spacetime. In particular, we compare two
different definitions proposed in the literature for the entropy using a
spatial averaging prescription. For one definition, the entropy of the
large-scale structure for a given comoving volume always grows with time, both
for a CDM and a $\Lambda$CDM model. In particular, while it diverges for a CDM
model, it saturates to a constant value in the presence of a cosmological
constant. The use of a light-cone averaging prescription in the context of the
evaluation of the entropy is also discussed.

for orthogonal basis functions with localized support regions that explain most
of the variability of a random process. The LFPCA is formulated as a convex
optimization problem through a novel Deflated Fantope Localization method and
is implemented through an efficient algorithm to obtain the global optimum. We
prove that the proposed LFPCA converges to the original FPCA when the tuning
parameters are chosen appropriately. Simulation shows that the proposed LFPCA
with tuning parameters chosen by cross validation can almost perfectly recover
the true eigenfunctions and significantly improve the estimation accuracy when
the eigenfunctions are truly supported on some subdomains. In the scenario that
the original eigenfunctions are not localized, the proposed LFPCA also serves
as a nice tool in finding orthogonal basis functions that balance between
interpretability and the capability of explaining variability of the data. The
analyses of a country mortality data and a growth curve data reveal interesting

failure tree analysis with the software GRIF/Tree, multi-phase Markov graphs

algorithm is optimal in the sense that the length of the sequence, measured by
the number of T gates, is smallest possible. In this paper, for each positive
even integer $n$ we consider the ""Clifford-cyclotomic"" gate set consisting of
the Clifford group plus a z-rotation by $\frac{\pi}{n}$. We present an
efficient exact synthesis algorithm which outputs a decomposition using the
minimum number of $\frac{\pi}{n}$ z-rotations. For the Clifford+T case $n=4$
the group of exactly synthesizable unitaries was shown to be equal to the group
of unitaries with entries over the ring $\mathbb{Z}[e^{i\frac{\pi}{n}},1/2]$.

allow us to test cosmological models. With the REFLEX II galaxy cluster survey
we previously derived tight constraints on the cosmological parameters for the
matter density, Omega_m, and the amplitude parameter of the matter density
fluctuations, sigma_8. Whereas in these previous studies no effect of massive
neutrinos was taken into account, we explore these effects in the present
publication. We derive cosmological constraints for the sum of the neutrino
masses of the conventional three neutrino families in the range 0 to 0.6 eV.
The influence on the constraints of Omega_m and sigma_8 for the expected mass
range is weak. Interesting constraints on the neutrino properties can be
derived by comparing the cluster data with those from the Planck cosmic
microwave background observations. The current tension between the Planck
results and clusters can formally be resolved with neutrino masses of about
M_nu = 0.45 (+- 0.28, 1-sigma) eV. While we caution not to consider this a firm
measurement because it might also be the result of unresolved systematics, it
is interesting that other measurements of the local large-scale structure
fluctuation amplitude, like that of cosmic lensing shear, yield similar results
and additionally confirm the effect of massive neutrinos. Among the indicators
for massive neutrinos, galaxy clusters and in particular our large and
well-controlled cluster survey currently provide the best potential for
constraints of the total neutrino mass.

field theory in the post-Newtonian scheme in the context of the binary inspiral
problem. We aim at an effective action, where all field modes below the orbital
scale are integrated out. We spell out the relevant degrees of freedom, in
particular the rotational ones, and the associated symmetries. Building on
these symmetries, we introduce the minimal coupling part of the point particle
action in terms of gauge rotational variables, and construct the spin-induced
nonminimal couplings, where we obtain the leading order couplings to all orders
in spin. We specify the gauge for the rotational variables, where the
unphysical degrees of freedom are eliminated already from the Feynman rules,
and all the orbital field modes are integrated out. The equations of motion of
the spin can be directly obtained via a proper variation of the action, and
Hamiltonians may be straightforwardly derived. We implement this effective
field theory for spin to derive all spin dependent potentials up to
next-to-leading order to quadratic level in spin, namely up to the third
post-Newtonian order for rapidly rotating compact objects. In particular, the
proper next-to-leading order spin-squared potential and Hamiltonian for generic
compact objects are also derived. For the implementations we use the
nonrelativistic gravitational field decomposition, which is found here to
eliminate higher-loop Feynman diagrams also in spin dependent sectors, and
facilitates derivations. This formulation for spin is thus ideal for treatment
of higher order spin dependent sectors.

coherent over large distances in the very high energy limit, which leads to a
suppression known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. We analyze the
case when the coherence lengths of two consecutive splitting processes overlap,
which is important for understanding corrections to standard treatments of the
LPM effect in QCD. Previous authors have analyzed this problem in the case of
overlapping double bremsstrahlung where at least one of the bremsstrahlung
gluons is soft. Here we show how to generalize to include the case where both
splittings are hard. A number of techniques must be developed, and so in this
paper we simplify by (i) restricting attention to a subset of the interference
effects, which we call the ""crossed"" diagrams, and (ii) working in the
large-$N_c$ limit. We first develop some general formulas that could in
principle be implemented numerically (with substantial difficulty). To make
more analytic progress, we then focus on the case of a thick, homogeneous
medium and make the multiple scattering approximation (also known as the $\hat
q$ or harmonic approximation) appropriate at high energy. We show that the
differential rate $d\Gamma/dx\,dy$ for overlapping double bremsstrahlung of
gluons with momentum fractions $x$ and $y$ can then be reduced to the
calculation of a 1-dimensional integral, which we perform numerically. [Though

dSph models are embedded in dark matter (DM) haloes with either a
centrally-divergent 'cusp', or an homogeneous-density 'core'. In agreement with
previous studies, we find that as tides strip the galaxy the evolution of the
half-light radius and the averaged velocity dispersion follows well-defined
tracks that are mainly controlled by the amount of mass lost. Crucially, the
evolutionary tracks behave differently depending on the shape of the DM
profile: at a fixed remnant mass, dSphs embedded in cored haloes have larger
sizes and higher velocity dispersions than their cuspy counterparts. The
divergent evolution is particularly pronounced in galaxies whose stellar
component is strongly segregated within their DM halo and becomes more
disparate as the remnant mass decreases. Our analysis indicates that the DM
profile plays an important role in defining the internal dynamics of tidal
streams. We find that stellar streams associated to cored DM models have
velocity dispersions that lie systematically above their cuspy counterparts.
Our results suggest that the dynamics of streams with known dSph progenitors

properties. This makes the mass-to-light ratio as derived from integrated
properties an inadequate probe of the low-mass end of the stellar mass
function. There is, therefore, no need for variations in the IMF, nor the need
to invoke depletion of low-mass stars, to explain the observations. Finally, we
find that the retention fraction of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is an
equally important parameter in understanding the mass segregation bias. We
speculatively put forward to idea that kinematical data of GCs can in fact be
used to constrain the total mass in stellar-mass BHs in GCs.

the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process $X$ driven by a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process $V$, i.e. the pair of processes defined by the non-Markovian
continuous-time long-memory dynamics $dX_{t}=-\theta X_{t}dt+dV_{t};\ t\geq 0$,
with $dV_{t}=-\rho V_{t}dt+dB_{t}^{H};\ t\geq 0$, where $\theta >0$ and $\rho
>0$ are unknown parameters, and $B^{H}$ is a fractional Brownian motion of
Hurst index $H\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$. We study the strong consistency as well as
the asymptotic normality of the joint least squares estimator
$(\hat{\theta}_{T},\widehat{\rho }% _{T}) $ of the pair $( \theta ,\rho) $,
based either on continuous or discrete observations of $\{X_{s};\ s\in \lbrack
0,T]\}$ as the horizon $T$ increases to +$\infty $. Both cases qualify formally
as partial-hbobservation questions since $V$ is unobserved. In the latter case,
several discretization options are considered. Our proofs of asymptotic
normality based on discrete data, rely on increasingly strict restrictions on
the sampling frequency as one reduces the extent of sources of observation. The
strategy for proving the asymptotic properties is to study the case of
continuous-time observations using the Malliavin calculus, and then to exploit
the fact that each discrete-data estimator can be considered as a perturbation
of the continuous one in a mathematically precise way, despite the fact that
the implementation of the discrete-time estimators is distant from the
continuous estimator. In this sense, we contend that the continuous-time
estimator cannot be implemented in practice in any na\""ive way, and serves only
as a mathematical tool in the study of the discrete-time estimators'
asymptotics.

atmosphere analysis are provided by (B-V) colors merged from several sources,
with individual reddening corrections applied to each star relative to a
cluster mean of E(B-V) = 0.16. Extensive use is made of ROBOSPECT, an automatic
equivalent width measurement program; its effectiveness on large spectroscopic
samples is discussed. From the sample of likely single members, [Fe/H] = -0.03
+/- 0.06, where the error describes the median absolute deviation about the
sample median value, leading to an internal precision for the cluster below
0.01 dex. The final uncertainty in the cluster abundance is therefore dominated
by external systematics due to the temperature scale, surface gravity, and
microturbulent velocity, leading to [Fe/H] = -0.02 +/- 0.02 for a sub-sample
restricted to main sequence and turnoff stars. This result is consistent with
our recent intermediate-band photometric determination of a slightly subsolar
abundance for this cluster. [Ca/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] are determined to be
solar within the uncertainties. NGC 6819 has an abundance distribution typical

J113831.4+351725.2 across four observational epochs. Using the SiIV doublet
components, we find that the blue component is usually saturated and non-black,
with the ratio of optical depths between the two components rarely being 2:1.
This indicates that these absorbers do not fully cover the line-of-sight and
thus a simple apparent optical depth model is insufficient when measuring the
true opacity of the absorbers. Tests with inhomogeneous (power-law) and
pure-partial coverage (step-function) models of the absorbing SiIV optical
depth predict the most un-blended doublet's component profiles equally well.
However, when testing with Gaussian-fitted doublet components to all SiIV
absorbers and averaging the total absorption predicted in each doublet, the
upper limit of the power law index is mostly unconstrained. This leads us to
favour pure partial coverage as a more accurate measure of the true optical
depth than the inhomogeneous power law model.
  The pure-partial coverage model indicates no significant change in covering
fraction across the epochs, with changes in the incident ionizing flux on the
absorbing gas instead being favoured as the variability mechanism. This is
supported by (a) the coordinated behaviour of the absorption troughs, (b) the
behaviour of the continuum at the blue end of the spectrum and (c) the
consistency of photoionization simulations of ionic column density dependencies
on ionization parameter with the observed variations. Evidence from the
simulations together with the CIV absorption profile indicates that the
absorber lies outside the broad line region, though the precise distance and
kinetic luminosity are not well constrained.

galaxies with an average velocity dispersion $\sigma \sim 250$ km s$^{-1}$ and
redshifts between $0.2<z<0.8$. More than half of the galaxies in the sample are
compact. The COSMOS galaxies exhibit a tight relation ($\sim0.1$ dex scatter)
between surface brightness, velocity dispersion and size. At a fixed
combination of velocity dispersion and size, the COSMOS galaxies are brighter
than galaxies in the local universe. These surface brightness offsets are
correlated with the rest-frame $g-z$ color and $D_n4000$ index; bluer galaxies
and those with smaller $D_n4000$ indices have larger offsets. Stellar
population synthesis models indicate that the massive COSMOS galaxies are
younger and therefore brighter than similarly massive quiescent galaxies in the
local universe. Passive evolution alone brings the massive compact quiescent
COSMOS galaxies onto the local fundamental plane at $z = 0$. Therefore,
evolution in size or velocity dispersion for massive compact quiescent galaxies
since $z\sim1$ is constrained by the small scatter observed in the fundamental
plane. We conclude that massive compact quiescent galaxies at $z\lesssim1$ are
not a special class of objects but rather the tail of the mass and size

contexts - giant planet formation, FU Orioni outbursts, feeding of AGNs, and
the origin of Pop III stars. When a gravitationally unstable disk is unable to
cool rapidly it settles into a quasi-stationary, fluctuating gravitoturbulent
state, in which its Toomre Q remains close to a constant value Q_0~1. Here we
develop an analytical formalism describing the evolution of such a disk, which
is based on the assumptions of Q=Q_0 and local thermal equilibrium. Our
approach works in the presence of additional sources of angular momentum
transport (e.g. MRI), as well as external irradiation. Thermal balance dictates
a unique value of the gravitoturbulent stress \alpha_{gt} driving disk
evolution, which is a function of the local surface density and angular
frequency. We compare this approach with other commonly used gravitoturbulent
viscosity prescriptions, which specify the explicit dependence of stress
\alpha_{gt} on Toomre Q in an ad hoc fashion, and identify the ones that
provide consistent results. We nevertheless argue that our Q=Q_0 approach is
more flexible, robust, and straightforward, and should be given preference in
applications. We illustrate this with a couple of analytical calculations -
locations of the snow line and of the outer edge of the dead zone in a
gravitoturbulent protoplanetary disk - which clearly show the simplicity and
versatility of the Q=Q_0 approach.

order to fully exploit the potential of these future surveys, a deep
theoretical understanding of the signatures imprinted by PNG on the large scale
structure of the Universe is necessary. In this paper, we explore the effect of
a stochastic moving barrier on the amplitude of the non-Gaussian bias induced
by local quadratic PNG. We show that, in the peak approach to halo clustering,
the amplitude of the non-Gaussian bias will generally differ from the
peak-background split prediction unless the barrier is flat and deterministic.
For excursion set peaks with a square-root barrier, which reproduce reasonably
well the linear bias $b_1$ and mass function $\bar{n}_\text{h}$ of SO haloes,
the non-Gaussian bias amplitude is $\sim 40$% larger than the peak-background
split expectation $d\ln\bar{n}_\text{h}/d\ln\sigma_8$ for haloes of mass $\sim
10^{13} {\it h}^{-1}M_\odot$ at $z=0$. Furthermore, we argue that the effect of
PNG on squeezed configurations of the halo bispectrum differs significantly

The
pairing coherence length in the spin-singlet channel for the effective density
dependent delta (DDD) and Gaussian interaction is estimated. We consider in our
calculations bound states as well as narrow resonances. It turns out that the
pairing gaps given by the DDD interaction are similar to those of the Gaussian
potential if one renormalizes the radial width to the nuclear radius. The
correlations induced by the pairing interaction have in all considered cases a
long range character inside the nucleus and decrease towards the surface. The
mean coherence length is larger than the geometrical radius for light nuclei
and approaches this value for heavy nuclei. The effect of the temperature and
states in continuum is investigated. Strong shell effects are evidenced,
especially for protons. We generalize this concept to quartets by considering
similar relations, but between proton and neutron pairs. The quartet coherence
length has a similar shape, but with larger values on the nuclear surface. We
evidence the important role of proton-neutron correlations by estimating the
so-called alpha coherence length, which takes into account the overlap with the
proton-neutron part of the $\alpha$-particle wave function. It turns out that
it does not depend on the nuclear size and has a value comparable to the free
$\alpha$-particle radius. We have shown that pairing correlations are mainly
concentrated inside the nucleus, while quarteting correlations are connected to
the nuclear surface.

the opposite amorphous-crystalline interface, after which cracks can finally be
nucleated. Even after nucleation, these cracks grow more sluggishly in an
amorphous intergranular film than they do along a clean grain boundary, since
the driving force for crack growth is lower in the amorphous film. The results
presented here suggest that amorphous intergranular films can act as toughening
features within a microstructure, and thus are promising for designing
nanostructured materials with better ductility and fracture toughness.

observations of the extreme ultraviolet emission lines of a wide range of
temperature T (log T = 5.3 - 6.4) from the EUV imaging spectrometer (EIS)
onboard the Hinode satellite. We present the EIS temperature maps and Doppler
maps, which are compared with magnetograms from the Michelson Doppler Imager

are <,25 km s$^{-1}$, which is typical of transient TR phenomena. The Dopper
velocities of the CBP were found to be < 20 km s^{-1} with exception of those
measured at log T = 6.2 where a distinct bi-directional jet is observed. From
an EM loci analysis we find evidence of single and double isothermal components
in the TRBP and CBP, respectively. TRBP and CBP loci curves are characterized
by broad distributions suggesting the existence of unresolved structure. By
comparing and contrasting the physical characteristics of the events we find
the BP phenomena are an indication of multi-scaled self similarity, given
similarities in both their underlying magnetic field configuration and
evolution in relation to EUV flux changes. In contrast, the blinker phenomena
and the TRBP are sufficiently dissimilar in their observed properties as to
constitute different event classes. Our work indicates that the measurement of
similar characteristics across multiple event types holds class-predictive

in unidirectional fields, a critical topic for ocean structures and naval
operations. One possible mechanism for the occurrence of such rare,
unusually-intense waves is nonlinear wave focusing. Recent results have
demonstrated that random localizations of energy, induced by the dispersive
mixing of different harmonics, can grow significantly due to localized
nonlinear focusing. Here we show how the interplay between i) statistical
properties captured through linear information such as the waves power spectrum
and ii) nonlinear dynamical properties of focusing localized wave groups
defines a critical length scale associated with the formation of extreme
events. The energy that is locally concentrated over this length scale acts as
the ""trigger"" of nonlinear focusing for wave groups and the formation of
subsequent rare events. We use this property to develop inexpensive, short-term
predictors of large water waves. Specifically, we show that by merely tracking
the energy of the wave field over the critical length scale allows for the
robust, inexpensive prediction of the location of intense waves with a
prediction window of 25 wave periods. We demonstrate our results in numerical
experiments of unidirectional water wave fields described by the Modified
Nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The presented approach introduces a new
paradigm for understanding and predicting intermittent and localized events in
dynamical systems characterized by uncertainty and potentially strong nonlinear
mechanisms.

critical dynamics is characterized by the coupling of the density field with
the bond-orientational order parameter $Q_4$, which measures the degree of
local crystallization. Two setups are compared, which present the transition at
different critical accelerations as a a result of modifying the energy
dissipation parameters. In both setups five independent critical exponents are
measured, associated to different properties of $Q_4$: the correlation length,
relaxation time, vanishing wavenumber limit (static susceptibility), the
hydrodynamic regime of the pair correlation function, and the amplitude of the
order parameter. The respective critical exponents agree in both setups and are
given by $\nu_{\perp} = 1$, $\nu_{\parallel} = 2$, $\gamma = 1$, $\eta \approx
0.6 - 0.67$, and $\beta=1/2$, whereas the dynamical critical exponent is $z =
\nu_{\parallel}/\nu_{\perp} = 2$. The agreement on five exponents is an exigent
test for the universality of the transition. Thus, while dissipation is
strictly necessary to form the crystal, the path the system undergoes towards
the phase separation is part of a well defined universality class. In fact, the
local order shows critical properties while density does not. Being the later
conserved, the appropriate model that couples both is model C in the Hohenberg

non-equilibrium extension to model C if we assume that $\alpha$, the exponent

extensions toward the solar equator. These extensions enhance the occurrence of
high-speed solar wind streams (HSS) and related co-rotating interaction regions
in the low-latitude heliosphere, and cause moderate, recurrent geomagnetic
activity in the near-Earth space. Here, using a novel definition of geomagnetic
activity at high (polar cap) latitudes and the longest record of magnetic
observations at a polar cap station, we calculate the annually averaged solar
wind speeds as proxies for the effective annual occurrence of HSS over the
whole Grand Modern Maximum (GMM) from 1920s onwards. We find that a period of
high annual speeds (frequent occurrence of HSS) occurs in the declining phase
of each solar cycle 16-23. For most cycles the HSS activity clearly maximizes
during one year, suggesting that typically only one strong activation leading
to a coronal hole extension is responsible for the HSS maximum. We find that
the most persistent HSS activity occurred in the declining phase of solar cycle
18. This suggests that cycle 19, which marks the sunspot maximum period of the
GMM, was preceded by exceptionally strong polar fields during the previous
sunspot minimum. This gives interesting support for the validity of solar
dynamo theory during this dramatic period of solar magnetism.

valuable insight into non-linearities and the emergence of causal structures in
quantum mechanics-essential for any formulation of a quantum theory of gravity.
Here we experimentally simulate the non-linear behaviour of a qubit interacting
unitarily with an older version of itself, addressing some of the fascinating
effects that arise in systems traversing a closed timelike curve. These include
perfect discrimination of non-orthogonal states and, most intriguingly, the
ability to distinguish nominally equivalent ways of preparing pure quantum
states. Finally, we examine the dependence of these effects on the initial
qubit state, the form of the unitary interaction, and the influence of
decoherence.

generic damping of the usual undamped long wavelength bosonic collective

magnetic fields (i.e., $\epsilon_{\rm e}\sim 0.37$ and $\epsilon_{\rm B}\sim

$\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$ and the goal is to distinguish whether $\rho$'s
spectrum satisfies some property $\mathcal{P}$ or is at least $\epsilon$-far in
$\ell_1$-distance from satisfying $\mathcal{P}$. This problem was promoted in
the survey of Montanaro and de Wolf under the name of testing unitarily
invariant properties of mixed states. It is the natural quantum analogue of the
classical problem of testing symmetric properties of probability distributions.
  Here, the hope is for algorithms with subquadratic copy complexity in the
dimension $d$. This is because the ""empirical Young diagram (EYD) algorithm""
can estimate the spectrum of a mixed state up to $\epsilon$-accuracy using only
$\widetilde{O}(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies. In this work, we show that given a
mixed state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$: (i) $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ copies
are necessary and sufficient to test whether $\rho$ is the maximally mixed
state, i.e., has spectrum $(\frac1d, ..., \frac1d)$; (ii)
$\Theta(r^2/\epsilon)$ copies are necessary and sufficient to test with
one-sided error whether $\rho$ has rank $r$, i.e., has at most $r$ nonzero
eigenvalues; (iii) $\widetilde{\Theta}(r^2/\Delta)$ copies are necessary and
sufficient to distinguish whether $\rho$ is maximally mixed on an
$r$-dimensional or an $(r+\Delta)$-dimensional subspace; and (iv) The EYD
algorithm requires $\Omega(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies to estimate the spectrum of
$\rho$ up to $\epsilon$-accuracy, nearly matching the known upper bound. In
addition, we simplify part of the proof of the upper bound. Our techniques
involve the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric group; in

between time series of companies stock prices, allowing the overall system to
be characterized by techniques borrowed from network science. Here we study the
presence of communities in the inferred stock market network, and show that the
knowledge about the communities alone can provide a nearly complete

model, a randomized version of the studied network sharing only the sizes and
interconnectivity between communities observed. We show that many topological
characteristics of the inferred networks are carried over the networks
generated by the null model. In particular, we find that in periods of
instability, such as during a financial crisis, the network strays away from a
state of well-defined community structure to a much more uniform topological
organization. We show that the framework presented here provides a good null

of scientific applications and data has only been a second order concern. With
science moving toward data-driven discoveries relying more on correlations in
data to form scientific hypotheses, the limitations of HPC approaches become
apparent: Architectural paradigms such as the separation of storage and compute
are not optimal for I/O intensive workloads (e.g. for data preparation,
transformation and SQL). While there are many powerful computational and
analytical libraries available on HPC (e.g. for scalable linear algebra), they
generally lack the usability and variety of analytical libraries found in other
environments (e.g. the Apache Hadoop ecosystem). Further, there is a lack of
abstractions that unify access to increasingly heterogeneous infrastructure
(HPC, Hadoop, clouds) and allow reasoning about performance trade-offs in this
complex environment. At the same time, the Hadoop ecosystem is evolving rapidly
and has established itself as de-facto standard for data-intensive workloads in
industry and is increasingly used to tackle scientific problems. In this paper,
we explore paths to interoperability between Hadoop and HPC, examine the
differences and challenges, such as the different architectural paradigms and
abstractions, and investigate ways to address them. We propose the extension of
the Pilot-Abstraction to Hadoop to serve as interoperability layer for
allocating and managing resources across different infrastructures. Further,
in-memory capabilities have been deployed to enhance the performance of
large-scale data analytics (e.g. iterative algorithms) for which the ability to
re-use data across iterations is critical. As memory naturally fits in with the
Pilot concept of retaining resources for a set of tasks, we propose the
extension of the Pilot-Abstraction to in-memory resources.

Math. Phys. 214(1), (2000)] that if the infimum is indeed achieved, then it is
achieved by a static metric; however, the more difficult question of whether or
not the infimum is achieved, is still an open problem. Bartnik [Comm. Anal.
Geom. 13(5), (2005)] then proved that critical points of the ADM mass, over the
space of solutions to the Einstein constraints on an asymptotically flat
manifold without boundary, correspond to stationary solutions. In that article,
he stated that it should be possible to use a similar construction to provide a
more natural proof of Corvino's result.
  In the first part of this note, we discuss the required modifications to
Bartnik's argument to adapt it to include a boundary. Assuming that certain
results concerning a Hilbert manifold structure for the space of solutions
carry over to the case considered here, we then demonstrate how Bartnik's proof
can be modified to consider the simpler case of scalar-flat extensions and
obtain Corvino's result.
  In the second part of this note, we consider a space of extensions in a fixed
conformal class. Sufficient conditions are given to ensure that the infimum is
realised within this class.

significant bulk conduction, such as metallic Bi2Se3, where it can be
challenging to separate the surface and bulk contribution to the measured spin

exfoliated from bulk insulating 3D TI Bi2Te2Se (BTS221) crystals, using two
outside nonmagnetic (Au) contacts for driving a DC spin helical current and a
middle ferromagnetic (FM)-Al2O3 tunneling contact for detecting spin
polarization. The voltage measured by the FM electrode exhibits a hysteretic
step-like change when sweeping an in-plane magnetic field between opposite

Importantly, the direction of this step-like voltage change can be reversed by
reversing the direction of the DC current, and the amplitude of the change as
measured by the difference in the detector voltage between opposite FM
magnetization increases linearly with increasing bias current, consistent with
the current-induced spin polarization of spin-momentum-locked TSS. Our work
directly demonstrates the electrical injection and detection of spin
polarization in TI and may enable utilization of spin-helical TSS for future
applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics.

emission from a single-layer graphene (ignoring the effects of substrate) and
to explore its application as the emitter of thermionic energy convertor (TIC).
An analytical formula has been derived, which is a function of temperature,
work function and Fermi energy level. The formula is significantly different
from the traditional Richardson-Dushman (RD) law for which it is independent of
mass to account for the supply function of the electrons in the graphene
behaving like massless Fermion quasiparticles. By comparing with a recent
experiment [Kaili Jiang et al., Nano Research 7, 553 (2014)] measuring electron
thermionic emission from a suspended single layer graphene, our model predicts
that the intrinsic work function of a single-layer graphene is about 4.514 eV
with a Fermi energy level of 0.083 eV. For a given work function, a new scaling
of $T^{3}$ is predicted, which is different from the traditional RD scaling of
$T^2$. If the work function of the graphene is lowered to 2.5 to 3 eV, and the
Fermi energy level is increased to 0.8 to 0.9 eV, it is possible to design a
graphene cathode based TIC operating at around 900 K or lower, as compared with
the metal-based cathode TIC (operating at about 1500 K). With a graphene based
cathode (work function = 4.514 eV) at 900 K, and a metallic based anode (work
function = 2.5 eV) like LaB$_6$ at 425 K, the efficiency of our proposed-TIC is
about 45$\%$

consume a certain amount of energy from the balloon, while the energy on

frequently. Instead, the balloons can harvest energy from natural energy
sources, e.g., solar energy, or from radio frequency energy by equipping with
appropriate circuits. However, such kinds of energy sources are often dynamic

this paper, we study the optimal energy allocation problem for the balloons
such that network performance is optimized and the revenue for service

quantum particle with long-range tunnelling amplitudes moving on a lattice with
the same on-site energy but with forbidden access to random sites (vacancies).
We examine the time and length scales of Anderson localization for this type of
disorder with realistic experimental parameters in the Hamiltonian. We show
that for an experimentally realized system of KRb molecules on an optical

2D systems on a time scale $t \sim 1$ sec. For 3D lattices with $55$ sites in
each dimension and vacancy concentration $ 90~\%$, the rotational excitations
diffuse to the edges of the lattice and show no signature of Anderson
localization. We examine the role of the long-range tunnelling amplitudes
allowing for transfer of rotational excitations between distant lattice sites.
Our results show that the long-range tunnelling has little impact on the
dynamics in the diffusive regime but affects significantly the localization
dynamics in lattices with large concentrations of vacancies, enhancing the
width of the localized distributions in 2D lattices by more than a factor of 2.

$K=10$ and for various values of the quantum parameter $k$ using Izrailev's
$N$-dimensional model for various $N \le 3000$, which in the limit $N
\rightarrow \infty$ tends to the exact quantized kicked rotator. By numerically
calculating the eigenfunctions in the basis of the angular momentum we find
that the localization length ${\cal L}$ for fixed parameter values has a
certain distribution, in fact its inverse is Gaussian distributed, in analogy
and in connection with the distribution of finite time Lyapunov exponents of
Hamilton systems. However, unlike the case of the finite time Lyapunov
exponents, this distribution is found to be independent of $N$, and thus
survives the limit $N=\infty$. This is different from the tight-binding model
of Anderson localization. The reason is that the finite bandwidth approximation
of the underlying Hamilton dynamical system in the Shepelyansky picture (D.L.
Shepelyansky, {\em Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 56}, 677 (1986)) does not apply
rigorously. This observation explains the strong fluctuations in the scaling
laws of the kicked rotator, such as e.g. the entropy localization measure as a
function of the scaling parameter $\Lambda={\cal L}/N$, where $\cal L$ is the
theoretical value of the localization length in the semiclassical
approximation. These results call for a more refined theory of the localization
length in the quantum kicked rotator and in similar Floquet systems, where we
must predict not only the mean value of the inverse of the localization length
$\cal L$ but also its (Gaussian) distribution, in particular the variance. In
order to complete our studies we numerically analyze the related behavior of
finite time Lyapunov exponents in the standard map and of the 2$\times$2
transfer matrix formalism. This paper is extending our recent work.

because it involves dealing with a wide range of related issues such as lack of
separation of concerns, and lack of high-level of abstractions to address both
the large scale and heterogeneity. Moreover, stakeholders involved in the
application development have to address issues that can be attributed to
different life-cycles phases. when developing applications. First, the
application logic has to be analyzed and then separated into a set of
distributed tasks for an underlying network. Then, the tasks have to be
implemented for the specific hardware. Apart from handling these issues, they
have to deal with other aspects of life-cycle such as changes in application
requirements and deployed devices. Several approaches have been proposed in the
closely related fields of wireless sensor network, ubiquitous and pervasive
computing, and software engineering in general to address the above challenges.
However, existing approaches only cover limited subsets of the above mentioned
challenges when applied to the IoT. This paper proposes an integrated approach
for addressing the above mentioned challenges. The main contributions of this
paper are: (1) a development methodology that separates IoT application
development into different concerns and provides a conceptual framework to
develop an application, (2) a development framework that implements the
development methodology to support actions of stakeholders. The development
framework provides a set of modeling languages to specify each development
concern and abstracts the scale and heterogeneity related complexity. It
integrates code generation, task-mapping, and linking techniques to provide
automation. Code generation supports the application development phase by
producing a programming framework that allows stakeholders to focus on the
application logic, while our mapping and linking techniques together support
the deployment phase by producing device-specific code to result in a
distributed system collaboratively hosted by individual devices. Our evaluation
based on two realistic scenarios shows that the use of our approach improves
the productivity of stakeholders involved in the application development.

that the roots of this new system include the original singular root but now

function virtualization, researchers have proposed a new cloud networking model
called Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) which enables both in-network packet
processing and application-specific network control. In this paper, we revisit
the problem of achieving network energy efficiency in data centers and identify
some new optimization challenges under the NaaS model. Particularly, we extend
the energy-efficient routing optimization from single-resource to
multi-resource settings. We characterize the problem through a detailed model
and provide a formal problem definition. Due to the high complexity of direct
solutions, we propose a greedy routing scheme to approximate the optimum, where
flows are selected progressively to exhaust residual capacities of active
nodes, and routing paths are assigned based on the distributions of both node
residual capacities and flow demands. By leveraging the structural regularity
of data center networks, we also provide a fast topology-aware heuristic method
based on hierarchically solving a series of vector bin packing instances. Our
simulations show that the proposed routing scheme can achieve significant gain
on energy savings and the topology-aware heuristic can produce comparably good
results while reducing the computation time to a large extent.

Most observational results on the high redshift restframe UV-bright
galaxies are based on samples pinpointed using the so called dropout technique
or Ly-alpha selection. However, the availability of multifilter data allows now
replacing the dropout selections by direct methods based on photometric
redshifts. In this paper we present the methodology to select and study the
population of high redshift galaxies in the ALHAMBRA survey data. Aims. Our aim
is to develop a less biased methodology than the traditional dropout technique
to study the high redshift galaxies in ALHAMBRA and other multifilter data.
Thanks to the wide area ALHAMBRA covers, we especially aim at contributing in
the study of the brightest, less frequent, high redshift galaxies. Methods. The
methodology is based on redshift probability distribution functions (zPDFs). It
is shown how a clean galaxy sample can be obtained by selecting the galaxies
with high integrated probability of being within a given redshift interval.
However, reaching both a complete and clean sample with this method is
challenging. Hence, a method to derive statistical properties by summing the
zPDFs of all the galaxies in the redshift bin of interest is introduced.
Results. Using this methodology we derive the galaxy rest frame UV number
counts in five redshift bins centred at z=2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5, being
complete up to the limiting magnitude at m_UV(AB)=24. With the wide field
ALHAMBRA data we especially contribute in the study of the brightest ends of
these counts, sampling well the surface densities down to m_UV(AB)=21-22.
Conclusions. We show that using the zPDFs it is easy to select a clean sample
of high redshift galaxies. We also show that statistical analysis of the
properties of galaxies is better done using a probabilistic approach, which
takes into account both the incompleteness and contamination in a natural way.

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can enable us to discover quiescent SMBHs,
constrain their mass function, study formation and evolution of transient
accretion disks and jet formation. A couple of jetted TDEs have been recently
claimed in hard X-rays, challenging jet models, previously applied to
$\gamma$-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. It is therefore of paramount
importance to increase the current sample. In this paper, we find that the best
strategy is not to use up-coming X-ray instruments alone, which will yield
between several (e-Rosita) and a couple of hundreds (Einstein Probe) events per
year below redshift one. We rather claim that a more efficient TDE hunter will
be the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) operating {\it in survey mode} at 1.4 GHz.
It may detect up to several hundreds of events per year below $z \sim 2.5$ with
a peak rate of a few tens per year at $z\approx 0.5$. Therefore, even if the
jet production efficiency is {\it not } $100\%$ as assumed here, the predicted
rates should be large enough to allow for statistical studies. The
characteristic TDE decay of $t^{-5/3}$, however, is not seen in radio, whose
flux is quite featureless. {\it Identification} therefore requires localization
and prompt repointing by higher energy instruments. If radio candidates would
be repointed within a day by future X-ray observatories (e.g. Athena and
LOFT-like missions), it will be possible to detect up to $\approx 400$ X-ray
counterparts, almost up to redshift $2$. The shortcome is that only for
redshift below $\approx 0.4$ the trigger times will be less than 10 days from
the explosion. In this regard the X-ray surveys are better suited to probe the
beginning of the flare, and are therefore complementary to SKA.

particle and called phase, that can be interpreted as the phase in the step
cycle in the frame of pedestrian flows. Here we also introduce a dynamics for
these phases, in order to modify the properties of the model. We investigate in

the density of pedestrians increases, the dependency of the outflow in the

the paramagnetic state, while a realistic account of long-range chemical

find that in case of the highly ordered alloys (Z=Sn and Sb) the exchange

particular, in case of Si the consideration of chemical disorder is essential
to reproduce the experimental N\'eel temperatures. Our numerical results
suggest that improving a heat treatment of the samples to suppress the
intermixing between the Mn and Si atoms, the N\'eel temperature of the Si-based

most sensitive to N. We also find a diversity in the abundance distributions,
with some clusters exhibiting clear abundance bimodalities (for example M3 and
M53) while others show extended distributions. The spread of Al abundances
increases significantly as cluster average metallicity decreases as previously
found by other works, which we take as evidence that low metallicity,
intermediate mass AGB polluters were more common in the more metal poor
clusters. The statistically significant correlation of [Al/Fe] with [Si/Fe] in
M15 suggests that $^{28}$Si leakage has occurred in this cluster. We also
present C, N and O abundances for stars cooler than 4500 K and examine the
behavior of A(C+N+O) in each cluster as a function of temperature and [Al/Fe].
The scatter of A(C+N+O) is close to its estimated uncertainty in all clusters
and independent on stellar temperature. A(C+N+O) exhibits small correlations
and anticorrelations with [Al/Fe] in M3 and M13, but we cannot be certain about

search for the most knowledgeable people with respect to a specific topic, and
the search is based on documents that describe people's activities. The task
involves taking a user query as input and returning a list of people who are
sorted by their level of expertise with respect to the user query. Despite
recent interest in the area, the current state-of-the-art techniques lack in
principled approaches for optimally combining different sources of evidence.
This article proposes two frameworks for combining multiple estimators of
expertise. These estimators are derived from textual contents, from
graph-structure of the citation patterns for the community of experts, and from
profile information about the experts. More specifically, this article explores
the use of supervised learning to rank methods, as well as rank aggregation
approaches, for combing all of the estimators of expertise. Several supervised
learning algorithms, which are representative of the pointwise, pairwise and
listwise approaches, were tested, and various state-of-the-art data fusion
techniques were also explored for the rank aggregation framework. Experiments
that were performed on a dataset of academic publications from the Computer
Science domain attest the adequacy of the proposed approaches.

The consequent imaginary part of the energy eigenvalue corresponds to the decay
rate or recombination probability of the three-body system. The method is
formulated in details and the relevant qualitative features are discussed as
functions of scattering lengths and masses. We use zero-range model in analyses
of recent recombination data. The dominating scattering length is usually
related to the non-equal two-body systems. We account for temperature smearing
which tends to wipe out the higher-lying Efimov peaks. The range and the
strength of the imaginary potential determine positions and shapes of the
Efimov peaks as well as the absolute value of the recombination rate. The
Efimov scaling between recombination peaks is calculated and shown to depend on
both scattering lengths. Recombination is predicted to be largest for
heavy-heavy-light systems. Universal properties of the optical parameters are
indicated. We compare to available experiments and find in general very
satisfactory agreement.

deduces a classifier. As a learner has only a local view of its environment,
classifiers can be exchanged among the learners and integrated, or merged, to
improve accuracy. However, the operation of merging is not defined for most
classifiers. Furthermore, the classifiers that have to be merged may be of
different types in settings such as ad-hoc networks in which several
generations of sensors may be creating classifiers. We introduce decision
spaces as a framework for merging possibly different classifiers. We formally
study the merging operation as an algebra, and prove that it satisfies a
desirable set of properties. The impact of time is discussed for the two main
data mining settings. Firstly, decision spaces can naturally be used with
non-stationary distributions, such as the data collected by sensor networks, as
the impact of a model decays over time. Secondly, we introduce an approach for
stationary distributions, such as homogeneous databases partitioned over
different learners, which ensures that all models have the same impact. We also
present a method that uses storage flexibly to achieve different types of decay
for non-stationary distributions. Finally, we show that the algebraic approach
developed for merging can also be used to analyze the behaviour of other
operators.

be a critical onset value of the streaming Reynolds number for swimming to

increases, from that generated by two independent oscillating spheres to a
collective flow pattern around the swimmer as a whole. The mechanism for

The conventional answer
based on analysis of games such as the Prisoners Dilemma (PD) is that it is
not, even though mutual cooperation results in a better outcome for all. This
incompatibility between individual rationality and collective benefit lies at
the heart of questions about the evolution of cooperation, as illustrated by PD
and similar games. Here, we argue that this apparent incompatibility is due to
an inconsistency in the standard Nash framework for analyzing non-cooperative
games and propose a new paradigm, that of the co-action equilibrium. As in the
Nash solution, agents know that others are just as rational as them and taking
this into account leads them to realize that others will independently adopt
the same strategy, in contrast to the idea of unilateral deviation central to
Nash equilibrium thinking. Co-action equilibrium results in better collective
outcomes for games representing social dilemmas, with relatively ""nicer""
strategies being chosen by rational selfish individuals. In particular, the
dilemma of PD gets resolved within this framework, suggesting that cooperation
can evolve in nature as the rational outcome even for selfish agents, without
having to take recourse to additional mechanisms for promoting it.

this issue. We first introduce the concept of mirrorability as the ability of a
model to produce symmetric results in mirrored images and introduce a
corresponding measure, namely the \textit{mirror error} that is defined as the
difference between the detection result on an image and the mirror of the
detection result on its mirror image. We evaluate the mirrorability of several
state of the art algorithms in two of the most intensively studied problems,
namely human pose estimation and face alignment. Our experiments lead to
several interesting findings: 1) Surprisingly, most of state of the art methods
struggle to preserve the mirror symmetry, despite the fact that they do have
very similar overall performance on the original and mirror images; 2) the low
mirrorability is not caused by training or testing sample bias - all algorithms
are trained on both the original images and their mirrored versions; 3) the
mirror error is strongly correlated to the localization/alignment error (with
correlation coefficients around 0.7). Since the mirror error is calculated
without knowledge of the ground truth, we show two interesting applications -
in the first it is used to guide the selection of difficult samples and in the
second to give feedback in a popular Cascaded Pose Regression method for face
alignment.

variability (conspicuous brightening of about 4 magnitudes (V), fast luminosity
declines, intrinsic pulsations). It was rejected as an RCB candidate in recent
investigations on spectroscopic grounds. We have collected and present all
available data from public sky surveys, photometric catalogues, and the
literature. From an analysis of these data, we have identified ASAS
J174600-2321.3 as a long-period eclipsing binary (Porb = 1011.5 days). The
primary star, which is probably a white dwarf, is currently in outburst and
exhibits the spectral characteristics of a reddened, early F-type supergiant;
the secondary star is a giant of spectral type late M. We discuss the possible
origin of the observed brightening, which is related to the primary component.
ASAS J174600-2321.3 is most certainly an eclipsing symbiotic binary - probably
a symbiotic nova of GCVS type NC - that is currently in outburst. However,
further photometric and spectroscopic data are needed to confirm this.

Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), with better angular resolutions at $>60$

with statistical methods which emphasize invariant quantities, by using data

correlated with $\ge 100$ EeV UHECR arrival directions at confidence level
$\approx 93\%$. The strength of the correlation decreases with decreasing UHECR
energy and no correlation exists at energy $\sim 60$ EeV. A search in

estimate the corresponding neutrino luminosity (25 TeV-2.2 PeV) and cosmic-ray

evolution, but is difficult to capture in global-scale numerical simulations
because of the wide range of timescales involved. Stellar evolution models
therefore usually adopt parameterizations for such transport based on idealized
laminar or mean-field models. Unfortunately, recent attempts to model this
transport in global simulations have produced results that are not consistent
with any of these idealized models. In an effort to explain the discrepancies
between global simulations and idealized models, we here use three-dimensional
local Cartesian simulations of compressible convection to study the efficiency
of transport by meridional flows below a convection zone in several parameter
regimes of relevance to the Sun and solar-type stars. In these local
simulations we are able to establish the correct ordering of dynamical
timescales, although the separation of the timescales remains unrealistic. We
find that, even though the generation of internal waves by convective overshoot
produces a high degree of time dependence in the meridional flow field, the
mean flow has the qualitative behavior predicted by laminar, ""balanced"" models.
In particular, we observe a progressive deepening, or ""burrowing"", of the mean
circulation if the local Eddington-Sweet timescale is shorter than the viscous
diffusion timescale. Such burrowing is a robust prediction of laminar models in
this parameter regime, but has never been observed in any previous numerical
simulation. We argue that previous simulations therefore underestimate the
transport by meridional flows.

First, linear simulations are performed in order to determine the turbulence
regime. Second, the heat fluxes in nonlinear simulations are matched to
experimental fluxes by varying the logarithmic ion temperature gradient within
the expected experimental error bars. Finally, the dependence of various
quantities with respect to the ion temperature gradient is analyzed in detail.
It is found that density and temperature fluctuations can vary significantly
with small changes in this parameter, thus making comparisons with experiments
very sensitive to uncertainties in the experimental profiles. However,
cross-phases are more robust, indicating that they are better observables for

then determined numerically, using a modification of Clifton and Ferreira's
approach; the redshifts are found to closely resemble their FLRW counterparts,
though with certain differences attributable to the `lumpiness' in the
underlying matter content. Most notably, the LW redshifts can differ from their
FLRW counterparts by as much as 30\%, even though they increase linearly with
FLRW redshifts, and they exhibit a non-zero integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect,
something which would not be possible in matter-dominated FLRW universes

dramatic consequences. While for perceptuo-motor functions neural activity is
shaped by the input's statistical properties, and processing is carried out at
high speed in hardwired spatially segregated modules, in reasoning, neural
activity is driven by internal dynamics, and processing times, stages, and
functional brain geometry are largely unconstrained a priori. Here, it is shown
that the complex properties of spontaneous activity, which can be ignored in a
short-lived event-related world, become prominent at the long time scales of
certain forms of reasoning which stretch over sufficiently long periods of
time. It is argued that the neural correlates of reasoning should in fact be
defined in terms of non-trivial generic properties of spontaneous brain
activity, and that this implies resorting to concepts, analytical tools, and
ways of designing experiments that are as yet non-standard in cognitive
neuroscience. The implications in terms of models of brain activity, shape of
the neural correlates, methods of data analysis, observability of the
phenomenon and experimental designs are discussed.

planetary-like objects. We present new RV results for 13 Kepler objects of

light curves of some interesting cases. We have found five spectroscopic and
eclipsing binaries. Among them, the case of KOI-3853 is of particular interest.
This system is a new example of the so-called heartbeat stars, showing dynamic
tidal distortions in the Kepler light curve. We have also detected duration and
depth variations of the eclipse. We suggest possible scenarios to explain such
effect, including the presence of a third substellar body possibly detected in
our RV analysis. We also provide upper mass limits to the transiting companions
of other six KOIs with large rotational velocities. This property prevents the
RV method to obtain the necessary precision to detect planetary-like masses.
Finally, we analyze the large RV variations of other two KOIs, incompatible
with the presence of planetary-mass objects. These objects are likely to be
stellar binaries but a longer timespan is still needed.

unknown eavesdropper channel characteristics, our approach is aimed at
maximizing throughput under dual performance constraints - a connection outage
constraint on the desired communication channel and a secrecy outage constraint
to guard against eavesdropping. We propose an adaptive transmission strategy
that judiciously selects the wiretap coding parameters, as well as the power
allocation between the artificial noise and the information signal. This
optimized solution reveals several important differences with respect to
solutions designed previously under the assumption of perfect feedback. We also
investigate the problem of how to most efficiently utilize the feedback bits.
The simulation results indicate that a good design strategy is to use
approximately 20% of these bits to quantize the channel gain information, with
the remainder to quantize the channel direction, and this allocation is largely
insensitive to the secrecy outage constraint imposed. In addition, we find that
8 feedback bits per transmit antenna is sufficient to achieve approximately 90%
of the throughput attainable with perfect feedback.

hierarchical clustering (AHC) raises an important issue: some correction needs
to be applied for the dimensionality of variables. In this work, we formulate
the decision of merging dependent multivariate normal variables in an AHC
procedure as a Bayesian model comparison. We found that the Bayesian
formulation naturally shrinks the empirical covariance matrix towards a matrix
set a priori (e.g., the identity), provides an automated stopping rule, and
corrects for dimensionality using a term that scales up the measure as a
function of the dimensionality of the variables. Also, the resulting log Bayes
factor is asymptotically proportional to the plug-in estimate of mutual
information, with an additive correction for dimensionality in agreement with
the Bayesian information criterion. We investigated the behavior of these
Bayesian alternatives (in exact and asymptotic forms) to mutual information on
simulated and real data. An encouraging result was first derived on
simulations: the hierarchical clustering based on the log Bayes factor
outperformed off-the-shelf clustering techniques as well as raw and normalized
mutual information in terms of classification accuracy. On a toy example, we
found that the Bayesian approaches led to results that were similar to those of
mutual information clustering techniques, with the advantage of an automated
thresholding. On real functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets
measuring brain activity, it identified clusters consistent with the
established outcome of standard procedures. On this application, normalized
mutual information had a highly atypical behavior, in the sense that it
systematically favored very large clusters. These initial experiments suggest

and engineering, and the reduction of such systems and their models to only
their slow components is often essential for scientific computation and further
analysis. Rather than being available in the form of an explicit analytical
model, often such systems can only be observed as a data set which exhibits
dynamics on several time scales. We will focus on applying and adapting data
mining and manifold learning techniques to detect the slow components in such
multiscale data. Traditional data mining methods are based on metrics (and
thus, geometries) which are not informed of the multiscale nature of the
underlying system dynamics; such methods cannot successfully recover the slow
variables. Here, we present an approach which utilizes both the local geometry
and the local dynamics within the data set through a metric which is both
insensitive to the fast variables and more general than simple statistical
averaging. Our analysis of the approach provides conditions for successfully
recovering the underlying slow variables, as well as an empirical protocol
guiding the selection of the method parameters.

error estimation of the localized reduced basis multi-scale (LRBMS) method for
parametric elliptic problems with possibly heterogeneous diffusion coefficient.
The numerical treatment of such parametric multi-scale problems are
characterized by a high computational complexity, arising from the multi-scale
character of the underlying differential equation and the additional parameter
dependence. The LRBMS method can be seen as a combination of numerical
multi-scale methods and model reduction using reduced basis (RB) methods to
efficiently reduce the computational complexity with respect to the multi-scale
as well as the parametric aspect of the problem, simultaneously. In contrast to
the classical residual based error estimators currently used in RB methods, we
are considering error estimators that are based on conservative flux
reconstruction and provide an efficient and rigorous bound on the full error
with respect to the weak solution. In addition, the resulting error estimator
is localized and can thus be used in the on-line phase to adaptively enrich the
solution space locally where needed. The resulting certified LRBMS method with
adaptive on-line enrichment thus guarantees the quality of the reduced solution
during the on-line phase, given any (possibly insufficient) reduced basis that
was generated during the offline phase. Numerical experiments are given to
demonstrate the applicability of the resulting algorithm with online enrichment
to single phase flow in heterogeneous media.

around spinning supermassive black holes by performing three-dimensional
smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations with Post-Newtonian corrections. Our
simulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the
efficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization
if radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams
self-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the
intersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a
geometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring
rapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a
geometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is
efficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and
forms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated
energy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the
subsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to
~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find
that a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced
circularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning
black hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably
long in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black
hole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important
nodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the
other hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in
the radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our
simulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar
tidal disruptions.

that all these methods yield very similar results for PFDavg, taking the
characteristics required by the standard into account. The choice of a method
should therefore not be determined by dogmatic assumptions, but should result
of a balance between modelling effort and objectives, given the system
properties. For this task, a discussion about pros and cons of each method is
proposed.

SL(2,R) realized geometrically on the curvature contraction of its one-sheeted
hyperboloid orbits endowed with its natural non-formal star-product. It is done
by a direct resolution of the defining equation of the star-exponential and
produces an expression with Bessel functions. This yields a continuous group
homomorphism from SL(2,R) into the von Neumann algebra of multipliers of the
Hilbert algebra underlied by this natural star-product. As an application, we
prove a new identity on Bessel functions.

maneuvering ship, aircraft, land vehicle, spacecraft or animate creature
carrying a wireless device. The sensor data is often limited and inaccurate
observations of range or bearing. This problem is more difficult than tracking
a ballistic trajectory, because an operative affects unknown and arbitrarily
changing accelerations. Although stochastic methods of filtering or state
estimation (Kalman filters and particle filters) are widely used, out of vogue
variational methods are more appropriate in this tracking context, because the
objects do not typically display any significant random motions at the length
and time scales of interest. This leads us to propose a rather elegant approach
based on a \emph{shadowing filter}. The resulting filter is efficient (reduces
to the solution of linear equations) and robust (uneffected by missing data and
singular correlations that would cause catastrophic failure of Bayesian
filters.) The tracking is so robust, that in some common situations it actually
performs better by ignoring error correlations that are so vital to Kalman
filters.

  and how KnoweScape can help us to make them?","preprint with figures",,,,"cs.DL physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is no escape from the expansion of information, so that structuring and
locating meaningful knowledge becomes ever more difficult. The question of how
to order our knowledge is as old as the systematic acquisition, circulation,
and storage of knowledge. Classification systems have been known since ancient
times. On the Internet, one finds both classifications and taxonomies designed
by information professionals and folksonomies based on social tagging.
Nevertheless, a user navigating through large information spaces is still
confronted with a text based search interface and a list of hits as outcome.
There is still an obvious gap between a physical encounter with, for example, a
librarys collection and browsing its content through an on-line catalogue. This
paper starts from the need of digital scholarship for effective knowledge
inquiry, revisits traditional ways to support knowledge ordering and
information retrieval, and introduces into a newly funded research network
where five different communities from all corners of the scientific landscape
join forces in a quest for knowledge maps. It can be read as a manifesto for a
newly funded specific research network KnoweScape. At the same time it is a
general reflection about what one has to take into account when representing
structure and evolution of data, information and knowledge and designing
instruments to help scholars and others to navigate across the lands and oceans
of knowledge.
