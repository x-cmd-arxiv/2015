sharing the topological property of being sequential, i.e., determined by the
convergence of its sequences and, so, by some limit operator $L$. As emphasized
in a classical article by Geroch, Liang and Wald, some of them have the
property, commonly regarded as a drawback, that there are points of the
spacetime $M$ non $T_1$-separated from points of the boundary $\partial M$.
  Here we show that this problem can be solved from a general topological
viewpoint. In particular, there is a canonical minimum refinement of the
topology in the completion $\overline{M}$ which $T_2$-separates the spacetime
$M$ and its boundary $\partial M$ ---no matter the type of completion one
chooses. Moreover, we analyze the case of sequential spaces and show how the
refined $T_2$-separating topology can be constructed from a modification $L^*$
of the original limit operator $L$. Finally, we particularize this procedure to
the case of the causal boundary and show how the separability of $M$ and
$\partial M$ can be introduced as an abstract axiom in its definition.

each of the galaxy formation models considered predicts a distribution of field
strengths with unique features. The most prominent of them is the difference in

its relation to our Euclidean space. We show that spin eigenstates cannot
generally be associated with directions in the Euclidean space, but only with
generalized directions in the Blochean space, which generally is a space of
higher dimension. Hence, spin entities have to be considered as genuine
non-spatial entities. We also show, however, that specific vectors can be
identified in the Blochean theater that are isomorphic to the Euclidean space
directions, and therefore representative of them, and that spin eigenstates
always have a predetermined orientation with respect to them. We use the
details of our results to put forward a new view of realism, that we call
'multiplex realism', providing a specific framework with which to interpret the
human observations and understanding of the component parts of the world.
Elements of reality can be represented in different theaters, one being our
customary Euclidean space, and another one the quantum realm, revealed to us
through our sophisticated experiments, whose elements of reality, in the
quantum jargon, are the eigenvalues and eigenstates. Our understanding of the
component parts of the world can then be guided by looking for the possible
connections, in the form of partial morphisms, between the different
representations, which is precisely what we do in this article with regard to
spin entities.

from the possibility of overlapping components. Yet, in many applications we
are perfectly happy to partition at least one of the modes. In this paper we
investigate what consequences does this partitioning have on the computational
complexity of the Boolean tensor factorizations and present a new algorithm for
the resulting clustering problem. This algorithm can alternatively be seen as a
particularly regularized clustering algorithm that can handle extremely
high-dimensional observations. We analyse our algorithms with the goal of
maximizing the similarity and argue that this is more meaningful than
minimizing the dissimilarity. As a by-product we obtain a PTAS and an efficient
0.828-approximation algorithm for rank-1 binary factorizations. Our algorithm
for Boolean tensor clustering achieves high scalability, high similarity, and
good generalization to unseen data with both synthetic and real-world data

protons locally conserve total kinetic energy when observed from an effective
frame of reference comoving with the fluctuations. For typical properties of
the fast wind, this frame can be reasonably identified by alpha particles,
which, owing to their drift with respect to protons at about the Alfv\'en speed
along the magnetic field, do not partake in the fluid low frequency
fluctuations. Using their velocity to transform proton velocity into the frame
of Alfv\'enic turbulence, we demonstrate that the resulting plasma motion is
characterized by a constant absolute value of the velocity, zero electric

unidirectional Alfv\'enic fluctuations in equilibrium. We propose that this
constraint, via the correlation between velocity and magnetic field in
Alfv\'enic turbulence, is at the origin of the observed constancy of the
magnetic field: while the constant velocity corresponding to constant energy
can be only observed in the frame of the fluctuations, the correspondingly
constant total magnetic field, invariant for Galilean transformations, remains
the observational signature, in the spacecraft frame, of the constant total
energy in the Alfv\'en turbulence frame.

(w(1),...,w(n)) in R^n where w ranges over all permutations in the symmetric
group. This polytope has many beautiful properties -- for example it provides a
way to visualize the weak Bruhat order: if we orient the permutohedron so that
the longest permutation w_0 is at the ""top"" and the identity e is at the
""bottom,"" then the one-skeleton of Perm is the Hasse diagram of the weak Bruhat
order. Equivalently, the paths from e to w_0 along the edges of Perm are in
bijection with the reduced decompositions of w_0. Moreover, the two-dimensional
faces of the permutohedron correspond to braid and commuting moves, which by
the Tits Lemma, connect any two reduced expressions of w_0.
  In this note we introduce some polytopes Br(k,n) (which we call bridge
polytopes) which provide a positive Grassmannian analogue of the permutohedron.
In this setting, BCFW bridge decompositions of reduced plabic graphs play the
role of reduced decompositions. We define Br(k,n) and explain how paths along
its edges encode BCFW bridge decompositions of the longest element pi(k,n) in
the circular Bruhat order. We also show that two-dimensional faces of Br(k,n)
correspond to certain local moves for plabic graphs, which by a result of
Postnikov [Pos06], connect any two reduced plabic graphs associated to pi(k,n).
All of these results can be generalized to the positive parts of Schubert
cells. A useful tool in our proofs is the fact that our polytopes are
isomorphic to certain Bruhat interval polytopes. Conversely, our results on
bridge polytopes allow us to deduce some corollaries about the structure of
Bruhat interval polytopes.

(V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments on the T cell receptor (TCR) loci.
To determine whether the structural ordering of these gene segments on the TCR
loci contributes to the observed clonal frequencies, the TCR loci were examined
for self-similarity and periodicity in terms of gene segment organization.
Logarithmic transformation of numeric sequence order demonstrated that the V
and J gene segments for both T cell receptor alpha (TRA) and beta (TRB) loci
were arranged in a self-similar manner when the spacing between adjacent
segments was considered as a function of the size of the neighboring gene
segment. The ratio of genomic distance between either the J (in TRA) or D (in
TRB) segments and successive V segments on these loci declined logarithmically.
Accounting for the gene segments occurring on helical DNA molecules, in a
logarithmic distribution, sine and cosine functions of the log transformed
angular coordinates of the start and stop nucleotides of successive TCR gene
segments showed an ordered progression across the locus, supporting a
log-periodic organization. T cell clonal frequencies, based on V and J segment
usage, from three normal stem cell donors plotted against the respective
segment locations on TRB locus demonstrated a periodic variation. We
hypothesize that this quasi-periodic variation in T cell clonal repertoire may
be influenced by the location of the gene segments on the logarithmically
scaled TCR loci. Interactions between the two strands of DNA in the double
helix may influence the probability of gene segment usage by means of either
constructive or destructive interference resulting from the superposition of
the two helices, impacting probability of DNA recombination.

similarly as it happened in the case of the World Wide web, will lead to
discoveries enlightening the structural and also the functional details of the
animal and human brains. When scientists examine large networks of tens or
hundreds of millions of vertices, only fast algorithms can be applied because
of the size constraints. In the case of diffusion MRI-based structural human
brain imaging, the effective vertex number of the connectomes, or brain graphs
derived from the data is on the scale of several hundred today. That size
facilitates applying strict mathematical graph algorithms even for some
hard-to-compute (or NP-hard) quantities like vertex cover or balanced minimum
cut. In the present work we have examined brain graphs, computed from the data
of the Human Connectome Project, recorded from male and female subjects between
ages 22 and 35. Significant differences were found between the male and female
structural brain graphs: we show that the average female connectome has more
edges, is a better expander graph, has larger minimal bisection width, and has
more spanning trees than the average male connectome. Since the average female
brain weights less than the brain of males, these properties show that the
female brain is more ""well-connected"" or perhaps, more ""efficient"" in a sense
than the brain of males.

around-mean-field (AMF) functionals for the double counting term, used to
subtract the correlation part from the DFT total energy, and compare these
results to the usual generalized-gradient-approximation (GGA) calculations.
Overall the use of AMF produces results similar to the GGA calculations. On the
other hand the effect of AL is diversified depending on the studied material.
In general the AL functional produces a stronger tendency towards magnetism
leading in some cases to unphysical electronic and magnetic properties. Thus
the choice of the adequate double-counting functional is crucial for the
results obtained using the GGA+U method.

are smaller and more persistent for single layer convection, rather than
convection by boundary layer instability. Smaller planets have initially larger

offsprings to neighboring lattice points and annihilate when they meet. Given
an odd number of initial particles, positive recurrence as seen from the

establish the existence of the process, and prove that the one-particle state

along with OGLE $V$ and $I$ light curves, to examine the variability of a
sample of luminous red giants in the SMC which show prominent long secondary
periods (LSPs). The origin of the LSPs is currently unknown. In oxygen-rich
stars, we found that while most broad band colours (e.g. $V-I$) get redder when
an oxygen-rich star dims during its LSP cycle, the $J$-$K$ colour barely
changes and sometimes becomes bluer. We interpret the $J$-$K$ colour changes as
being due to increasing water vapour absorption during declining light caused
by the development a layer of dense cool gas above the photosphere. This result
and previous observations which indicate the development of a chromosphere
between minimum to maximum light suggest that the LSP phenomenon is associated
with the ejection of matter from the stellar photosphere near the beginning of
light decline. We explore the possibility that broadband light variations from
the optical to the near-IR regions can be explained by either dust absorption
by ejected matter or large spots on a rotating stellar surface. However,
neither model is capable of explaining the observed light variations in a
variety of colour-magnitude diagrams. We conclude that some other mechanism is
responsible for the light variations associated with LSPs in red giants.

in 10 to 100 yr could still be negligible. Bursts are modeled as sub-ns,
coherent shot pulses superposed incoherently to produce ms-duration $\sim 1$ Jy
amplitudes; each shot-pulse can be much weaker than the burst amplitude,
placing less restrictive requirements on the emission process. Nonetheless,
single shot pulses are similar to the extreme, unresolved ($< 0.4$ ns) MJy shot
pulse seen from the Crab pulsar, which is consistent with coherent curvature
radiation emitted near the light cylinder by an almost neutral clump with net
charge $\sim \pm 10^{21}e$ and total energy $\gtrsim 10^{23}$ ergs. Bursts from
Gpc distances require incoherent superposition of $\sim 10^{12}d_{\rm Gpc}^2$
shot pulses or a total energy $\gtrsim 10^{35} d_{\rm Gpc}^2$ erg. The energy
reservoir near the light cylinder limits the detection distance to $\lesssim
{\rm few} \times 100$ Mpc for a fluence $\sim 1$ Jy ms unless conditions are
more extreme than for the Crab pulsar. Similarly, extreme single pulses from
ordinary pulsars and magnetars could be detectable from throughout the Local
Group and perhaps farther. Contributions to dispersion measures from galaxy
clusters will be significant for some of the bursts. We discuss tests for the
signatures of bursts associated with extragalactic NSs.

topological insulators have ignited worldwide interest in physics and materials
science. A Weyl semimetal is an unusual crystal where electrons also behave as
massless quasi-particles but interestingly they are not Dirac fermions. These
massless particles, Weyl fermions, were originally considered in massless
quantum electrodynamics but have not been observed as a fundamental particle in
nature. A Weyl semimetal provides a condensed matter realization of Weyl
fermions, leading to unique transport properties with novel device
applications. Here, we THEORETICALLY identify the first Weyl semimetal in a
class of stoichiometric materials (TaAs, NbAs, NbP, TaP), which break
crystalline inversion symmetry, including TaAs, TaP, NbAs and NbP. Our
first-principles calculation-based predictions on TaAs reveal the
spin-polarized Weyl cones and Fermi arc surface states in this compound. We
also observe pairs of Weyl points with the same chiral charge which project
onto the same point in the surface Brillouin zone, giving rise to multiple
Fermi arcs connecting to a given Weyl point. Our results show that TaAs is the
first topological semimetal identified which does not depend on fine-tuning of
chemical composition or magnetic order, greatly facilitating an exploration of
Weyl physics in real materials. (Note added: This theoretical prediction of
November 2014 (see paper in Nature Communications) was the basis for the first

where each high-dimensional, real-valued image is mapped onto a
low-dimensional, binary vector and the search is done in this binary space.
Finding the optimal hash function is difficult because it involves binary
constraints, and most approaches approximate the optimization by relaxing the
constraints and then binarizing the result. Here, we focus on the binary
autoencoder model, which seeks to reconstruct an image from the binary code
produced by the hash function. We show that the optimization can be simplified
with the method of auxiliary coordinates. This reformulates the optimization as
alternating two easier steps: one that learns the encoder and decoder
separately, and one that optimizes the code for each image. Image retrieval
experiments, using precision/recall and a measure of code utilization, show the
resulting hash function outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art
methods for binary hashing.

more. This is in fact ten times more than the current number of known clusters
in the Universe. Additionally between 50,000 and 100,000 tailed radio galaxies

optical microscopy and spectroscopy. As a demonstration of the possibilities of
the developed approach, we performed real-time in situ microscopy studies of
water condensation on a surface of wing scales of Morpho sulkowskyi butterfly.
We have found that the initial water nucleation takes place on the top of the

invariant. The amplitude of the power spectrum can be constrained by different
observations such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), Lyman-$\alpha$,
large-scale structures and primordial black holes (PBHs). Although the
constraints from the CMB are robust, the corresponding scales are very large
($10^{-4}<k<1 \mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$). For small scales ($k > 1
\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$), the research on the PBHs provides much weaker limits.
Recently, ultracompact dark matter minihalos (UCMHs) was proposed and it was
found that they could be used to constraint the small-scale primordial power
spectrum. The limits obtained by the research on the UCMHs are much better than
that of PBHs. Most of previous works focus on the dark matter annihilation
within the UCMHs, but if the dark matter particles do not annihilate the decay
is another important issue. In previous work~\cite{EPL}, we investigated the
gamma-ray flux from the UCMHs due to the dark matter decay. In addition to
these flux, the neutrinos are usually produced going with the gamma-ray photons
especially for the lepton channels. In this work, we studied the neutrino flux
from the UCMHs due to the dark matter decay. Finally, we got the constraints on
the amplitude of primordial power spectrum of small scales.

the gamma-ray source PMN J1603-4904, which are difficult to reconcile with any

atypical blazar or compact jet source seen at a larger angle to the line of
sight. In order to determine the physical origin of the high-energy emission
processes in PMN J1603-4904, we study the X-ray spectrum in detail. We
performed quasi-simultaneous X-ray observations with XMM-Newton and Suzaku in
2013 September, resulting in the first high signal-to-noise X-ray spectrum of
this source. The 2-10 keV X-ray spectrum can be well described by an absorbed
power law with an emission line at 5.44$\pm$0.05 keV (observed frame).
Interpreting this feature as a K{\alpha} line from neutral iron, we determine
the redshift of PMN J1603-4904 to be z=0.18$\pm$0.01, corresponding to a
luminosity distance of 872$\pm$54 Mpc. The detection of a redshifted X-ray
emission line further challenges the original BL Lac classification of PMN
J1603-4904. This result suggests that the source is observed at a larger angle
to the line of sight than expected for blazars, and thus the source would add
to the elusive class of gamma-ray loud misaligned-jet objects, possibly a
{\gamma}-ray bright young radio galaxy.

X-ray Timing Explorer. We find that the pulse amplitude systematically changes
by a factor of ~2 when the upper kHz QPO frequency passes through 401 Hz: it
halves when the QPO moves to above the spin frequency and doubles again on the
way back. This establishes for the first time the existence of a direct effect
of kHz QPOs on the millisecond pulsations and provides a new clue to the origin
of the upper kHz QPO. We discuss several scenarios and conclude that while more
complex explanations can not formally be excluded, our result strongly suggests
that the QPO is produced by azimuthal motion at the inner edge of the accretion
disk, most likely orbital motion. Depending on whether this azimuthal motion is
faster or slower than the spin, the plasma then interacts differently with the
neutron-star magnetic field. The most straightforward interpretation involves
magnetospheric centrifugal inhibition of the accretion flow that sets in when
the upper kHz QPO becomes slower than the spin.

A-phase even at higher pressures of about 30 (bar) and make the B-phase the
only state in equilibrium, while SC contributions accompanied by a global
stretched anisotropy to the GL quartic terms generally tend to broaden the
stability region of the A-phase compared with that of the B-phase. In
particular, in contrast to the cases in bulk and in the isotropic aerogel, the
SC corrections to the GL {\it quadratic} terms are not negligible in the
globally anisotropic case but may change the sign of the apparent anisotropy
depending on the magnitude of the frequency cutoff of the normal paramagnon
propagator. Based on this sign change of the apparent anisotropy, we discuss
different strange observations on superfluid $^3$He in porous media such as
disappearance of the polar superfluid phase at higher pressures seen in
nematically-ordered aerogels and absence of the B-phase and of the A-phase with
planar ${\hat {\bf l}}$-vector in a stretched aerogel.

one-particle irreducible vertex functions. The most natural truncation of the
resulting infinite hierarchy of flow equations is shown to be fully equivalent
to self-consistent perturbation theory. An earlier suggested alternative
truncation strategy is considered as well. In a second step, the cutoff is
introduced in the two-particle interaction. Again two truncation procedures are
investigated, one of which was derived before. In the latter, the mean-field

the scaling property of the problem the energy and $B(E2)$ transition ratios
depend on a single parameter apart from an integer number which limits the

expulsion. Therefore the surface density of a single cluster can change
considerably in young clusters/associations during the first 20 Myr of their
development. We investigate the effect of the gas expulsion on the
detectability of clusters/associations typical for the solar neighborhood,
where the star formation efficiency is <35%. The main focus will be laid on the
dependence on the initial cluster mass. Nbody methods are used to determine the
cluster/association dynamics after gas expulsion. We find that, even for low
background densities, only clusters/associations with initial central surface
densities exceeding a few 5000 M(sun)/pc2 will be detected as clusters at ages
~5 Myr. Even the Orion Nebula cluster, one of the most massive nearby clusters,
would only be categorized as a small co-moving group with current methods after
5 Myr of development. This means that cluster expansion leads to a selection
effect - at ages of <1-2 Myr the full range of clusters/associations is
observed whereas at ages > 4 Myr only the most massive clusters are identified,
while systems with initially M_c < 3 000 M(sun) are missing. The temporal
development of stellar properties is usually determined by observing clusters
of different ages. The potentially strong inhomogeneity of the cluster sample

time dependent black hole spacetime. Here we consider the static de Sitter
cosmic string and the Kerr-de Sitter spacetime to show that there can be some
non-vanishing effect due to $\Lambda$ for physical polarizations. Consistency
of these results with the polarization sum rule is discussed.

0.5<E(B-V)<1.5, selected using near infra-red (NIR) imaging data from the
UKIDSS-LAS, ESO-VHS and WISE surveys. NIR spectra obtained using the Very Large
Telescope (VLT) for 24 new objects bring our total sample of spectroscopically
confirmed hyperluminous (>10^{13}L_0), high-redshift dusty quasars to 38. There
is no evidence for reddened quasars having significantly different H$\alpha$
equivalent widths relative to unobscured quasars. The average black-hole masses
(~10^9-10^10 M_0) and bolometric luminosities (~10^{47} erg/s) are comparable
to the most luminous unobscured quasars at the same redshift, but with a tail
extending to very high luminosities of ~10^{48} erg/s. Sixty-six per cent of
the reddened quasars are detected at $>3\sigma$ at 22um by WISE. The average
6um rest-frame luminosity is log10(L6um/erg/s)=47.1+/-0.4, making the objects
among the mid-infrared brightest AGN currently known. The extinction-corrected
space-density estimate now extends over three magnitudes (-30 < M_i < -27) and
demonstrates that the reddened quasar luminosity function is significantly
flatter than that of the unobscured quasar population at z=2-3. At the
brightest magnitudes, M_i < -29, the space density of our dust-reddened
population exceeds that of unobscured quasars. A model where the probability
that a quasar becomes dust-reddened increases at high luminosity is consistent
with the observations and such a dependence could be explained by an increase
in luminosity and extinction during AGN-fuelling phases. The properties of our
obscured Type 1 quasars are distinct from the heavily obscured, Compton-thick
AGN that have been identified at much fainter luminosities and we conclude that
they likely correspond to a brief evolutionary phase in massive galaxy
formation.

software. This memoir proposes a regimen to verify such algorithms at
prescribed levels of statistical confidence. The United States Department of
Defense standard for system safety engineering (MIL-STD-882E) defines
development procedures for safety-critical systems. However, a problem exists:
the Standard fails to distinguish quantitative product assurance technique from
categorical process assurance method for software development. Resulting is
conflict in the technical definition of the term risk. The primary goal here is
to show that a quantitative risk-based product assurance method exists and is
consistent with hardware practice. Discussion appears in two major parts:
theory, which shows the relationship between automata and software; and
application, which covers demonstration and indemnification. Demonstration is a
technique for generating random tests; indemnification converts pass/fail test
results to compound Poisson parameters (severity and intensity). Together,
demonstration and indemnification yield statistical confidence that
safety-critical code meets design intent. Statistical confidence is the
keystone of quantitative product assurance. A secondary goal is resolving the
conflict over the term risk. The first meaning is an accident model known in
mathematics as the compound Poisson stochastic process, and so is called
statistical risk. Various of its versions underlie the theories of safety and
reliability. The second is called developmental risk. It considers software
autonomy, which considers time until manual recovery of control. Once these
meanings are separated, MIL-STD-882 can properly support either formal
quantitative safety assurance or empirical process robustness, which differ in
impact.

with small body size which imply large gradients. Besides, the inclusion of
this dispersion leads to physical phenomena absent without it. An example of
the latter is flexoelectricity. Remarkable fact is that while the derivation of
differential equations of elastic equilibrium can be made by ordinary means in
this case, the derivation of boundary conditions for them is less trivial task.
This is due to the fact that strain gradients should be represented in terms of
second gradients of independently varied elastic displacements. Detailed

understanding both the early stages of planet formation and the evolution of
planetary ring systems. Simple chemicals such as methanol and formic acid are
known to be present in cold protostellar regions alongside the dominant water
ice; they are also likely to be incorporated into planets which form in
protoplanetary disks, and planetary ring systems. However, the effect of the
chemical composition of the ice on its collisional properties has not yet been
studied. Aims: Collisions of 1.5 cm ice spheres composed of pure crystalline
water ice, water with 5% methanol, and water with 5% formic acid were
investigated to determine the effect of the ice composition on the collisional
outcomes. Methods: The collisions were conducted in a dedicated experimental
instrument, operated under microgravity conditions, at relative particle impact
velocities between 0.01 and 0.19 m s^-1, temperatures between 131 and 160 K and
a pressure of around 10^-5 mbar. Results: A range of coefficients of
restitution were found, with no correlation between this and the chemical
composition, relative impact velocity, or temperature. Conclusions: We conclude
that the chemical composition of the ice (at the level of 95% water ice and 5%
methanol or formic acid) does not affect the collisional properties at these
temperatures and pressures due to the inability of surface wetting to take
place. At a level of 5% methanol or formic acid, the structure is likely to be
dominated by crystalline water ice, leading to no change in collisional
properties. The surface roughness of the particles is the dominant factor in
explaining the range of coefficients of restitution.

a non-trivial shape we discuss how lattices with an adaptive lattice spacing
can be implemented. Since the parameters of the Hamiltonian transform
non-trivially under changes of the length-scale, adapting the lattice spacing
is much more difficult than in the case of the numerical solution of partial
differential equations, where this method is common practice. Here we shall
focus on the universality class of the three-dimensional Ising model. Our
starting point is the improved Blume-Capel model on the simple cubic lattice.
In our approach, the system is composed of sectors with lattice spacing a, 2 a,
4 a, ... . We work out how parts of the lattice with lattice spacing a and 2 a,
respectively, can be coupled in a consistent way. Here, we restrict ourself to
the case, where the boundary between the sectors is perpendicular to one of the
lattice-axis. Based on the theory of defect planes one expects that it is
sufficient to tune the coupling between these two regions. To this end we
perform a finite size scaling study. However first numerical results show that
slowly decaying corrections remain. It turns out that these corrections can be
removed by adjusting the strength of the couplings within the boundary layers.
As benchmark, we simulate films with strongly symmetry breaking boundary
conditions. We determine the magnetization profile and the thermodynamic
Casimir force. For our largest thickness L_0=64.5, we find that results
obtained for the homogeneous system are nicely reproduced.

properties in multiferroic materials. However, determination of intrinsic
polarization by this method is not straightforward because of leakage current
and trapped charge carriers. Here, we demonstrate the formation of internal
electric field due to thermally stimulated charge carriers and its influence on
ferroelectric polarization in a polycrystalline sample of the well known
multiferroic TbMnO$_3$. While an electric field ($E_{ext}$) poling across the
ferroelectric transition ($T_C$ $\sim$ 26 K) is essential to obtain
depolarization current at $T_C$, the sample poled only in the paraelectric
state ($T_{pole}$ = 130 $-$ 50 K) also exhibits a pyro-current peak at $T_C$
but with the same polarity ($-$ $I_{pyro}$) as that of the external field ($-$
$E_{ext}$). We demonstrate that these unusual behavior of pyro-current are
caused by a positive internal electric field ($+$ $E_{int}$) which in turn is
created by thermally stimulated free charge carriers during the poling process
in the paraelectric state. We also show that a combination of DC-biased current
and pyro-current measurements is a promising method to study the intrinsic
ferroelectric properties in multiferroic materials.

theories behaves just like ordinary Yang-Mills theory. In particular, they all
share the Yang-Mills theory MHV amplitudes. Moreover, these theories remain
constructible in the sense that higher-point tree level scattering amplitudes
can be obtained from the lower-point amplitudes using the BCFW recursion
relations. Also, the square of these gauge-theory amplitudes gives the
scattering amplitudes of ""deformations"" of General Relativity, at least for the

q-deformed gauge group. In the standard undeformed case, loop gravity is a
formulation of general relativity as a diffeomorphism-invariant SU(2) gauge
theory. Its classical states are graphs provided with algebraic data. In
particular closure constraints at every node of the graph ensure their
interpretation as twisted geometries. Dual to each node, one has a polyhedron
embedded in flat space R^3. One then glues them allowing for both curvature and
torsion. It was recently conjectured that q-deforming the gauge group SU(2)
would allow to account for a non-vanishing cosmological constant Lambda, and in
particular that deforming the loop gravity phase space with real parameter q>0
would lead to a generalization of twisted geometries to a hyperbolic curvature.
Following this insight, we look for generalization of the closure constraints
to the hyperbolic case. In particular, we introduce two new closure constraints
for hyperbolic tetrahedra. One is compact and expressed in terms of normal
rotations (group elements in SU(2) associated to the triangles) and the second
is non-compact and expressed in terms of triangular matrices (group elements in
SB(2,C)). We show that these closure constraints both define a unique dual
tetrahedron (up to global translations on the three-dimensional one-sheet

  hyperspectral images",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A fast forward feature selection algorithm is presented in this paper. It is
based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) classifier. GMM are used for
classifying hyperspectral images. The algorithm selects iteratively spectral
features that maximizes an estimation of the classification rate. The
estimation is done using the k-fold cross validation. In order to perform fast
in terms of computing time, an efficient implementation is proposed. First, the
GMM can be updated when the estimation of the classification rate is computed,
rather than re-estimate the full model. Secondly, using marginalization of the
GMM, sub models can be directly obtained from the full model learned with all
the spectral features. Experimental results for two real hyperspectral data
sets show that the method performs very well in terms of classification
accuracy and processing time. Furthermore, the extracted model contains very
few spectral channels.

difficult to quantify. Aims. We want to check whether the far-infrared and
submillimeter high-resolution data from Herschel SPIRE and PACS cameras
combined with ground-based telescope bolometers allow us to retrieve the whole
dust content of cold dark clouds. Methods. We compare far-infrared and
submillimeter emission across L183 to the 8 $\mu$m absorption map from Spitzer
data and fit modified blackbody functions towards three different positions.
Results. We find that none of the Herschel SPIRE channels follow the cold dust
profile seen in absorption. Even the ground-based submillimeter telescope
observations, although more closely following the absorption profile, cannot
help to characterize the cold dust without external information such as the
dust column density itself. The difference in dust opacity can reach up to a
factor of 3 in prestellar cores of high extinction. Conclusions. In dark
clouds, the amount of very cold dust cannot be measured from its emission
alone. In particular, studies of dark clouds based only on Herschel data can
miss a large fraction of the dust content. This has an impact on core and
filament density profiles, masse and stability estimates.

companion. By determining more carefully the properties of the companion, we
hope to better constrain the properties of the AGB star. METHODS: We present
new spectral observations of the binary star W Aql at minimum and maximum
brightness and new photometric observations of W Aql at minimum brightness.
RESULTS: The composite spectrum near minimum light is predominantly from the
companion at wavelengths $\lambda$ < 6000 $\AA$. This spectrum can be
classified as F8 to G0, and the brightness of the companion is that of a dwarf
star. Therefore, it can be concluded that the companion is a main sequence
star. From this, we are able to constrain the mass of the AGB component to 1.04
- 3 $M_\odot$ and the mass of the W Aql system to 2.1 - 4.1 $M_\odot$ . Our
photometric results are broadly consistent with this classification and suggest
that the main sequence component suffers from approximately 2 mag of extinction
in the V band primarily due to the dust surrounding the AGB component.

The electron number density of surrounding magnetized plasma has a typical for

the Alfven speed inside the jet is equal to 78.3 km/s. We model the surge as a

tube surrounded by plasma with homogeneous background magnetic field, and (ii)
a twisted tube which environment is plasma with also twisted magnetic field.
The magnetic field twist in given region is characterized by the ratio of
azimuthal to the axial magnetic field components evaluated at the flux tube

supported by the plasma flow in both magnetic field configurations show that
unstable against Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can only be the MHD waves with
high negative mode numbers and the instability occurs at sub-Alfvenic critical

stars is studied through its effect on the parameters of horizontal branch (HB)
stars. The scaling factors from Reimers (1975) and Schroder & Cuntz (2005) are
determined for 56 well-studied Galactic globular clusters (GCs). The median
values among clusters are, respectively, {\eta}_R = 0.477 +/- 0.070
(+0.050/-0.062) and {\eta}_SC = 0.172 +/- 0.024 (+0.018/-0.023) (standard
deviation and systematic uncertainties, respectively). Mass-loss mechanisms on
the RGB have very little metallicity dependence: over a factor of 200 in iron
abundance, {\eta} varies by <~30 per cent, within the current systematic
uncertainties on cluster ages and evolution models. Since {\eta} incorporates
cluster age, the low standard deviation of {\eta} among clusters (~14 per cent)
suggests that age can almost entirely account for the ""second parameter
problem"". The remaining spread in {\eta} correlates with cluster mass and
density, suggesting helium enrichment provides the third parameter explaining
HB morphology of GCs. The metallicity variation is reduced further if globular
clusters are more co-eval than generally thought. This would also better
reproduce the observed AGB tip luminosities, which are not well modelled by
extrapolating the RGB {\eta} to later evolutionary epochs.

the $X(3915)$, which is quoted as a $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ state in the Particle Data

both channels, which means that the $X(3915)$ and the $X(3930)$ can be regarded
as the same $J^{PC}=2^{++}$ state. Meanwhile, the data also prefer a large
helicity-0 contribution of this tensor resonance to the amplitudes instead of
the helicity-2 dominance assumed by {\it BABAR}, which may indicate a sizable
portion of non-$q\bar q$ components in this state. Identifying the $X(3915)$
with the $X(3930)$ and abandoning the helicity-2 dominance for this tensor
state are helpful for the further understandings of the properties of this

become more aggressive at the equilibrium in the game setting in comparison
with the team problem by using slotted Aloha mechanism. Consequently, more
packets are in collision and are lost. To reduce these phenomena and to enhance
the performance of the networks, we propose to combine ZigZag decoding approach
with non cooperative slotted Aloha mechanism. This approach was introduced in
our previous work based on the cooperative slotted Aloha mechanism. The
obtained results showed that this approach has significantly improved the
cooperative slotted Aloha mechanism and gave best results for the throughput
and delay. In this paper, we analyze the impact of combining non cooperative
slotted Aloha and ZigZag Decoding. We model the system by a two dimensional
Markov chain that integrates the effect of ZigZag decoding. The states of the
Markov chain describe the number of backlogged packets among the users. We use
a stochastic game to achieve our objective; we evaluate and compare the
performances parameters of the proposed approach with those of a simple slotted
Aloha mechanism. All found results show that our approach improves the
performance parameters of the system.

fractal Weyl law, which connects the density of eigenstates to the dimension
$D_0$ of the classical invariant set of open systems. Quantum systems of
interest are often {\it partially} open (e.g., cavities in which trajectories

is trivial (equal to the phase-space dimension), and the fractality is
manifested in the (multifractal) spectrum of R\'enyi dimensions $D_q$. In this

a function of $M$ and other relevant parameters. We propose a classical model

established. Boundary regularity of domains is replaced with information on
boundary traces of trial functions and of their derivatives up to some explicit
minimal order. The relevant Sobolev inequalities involve constants independent
of the geometry of the domain, and exhibit the same critical exponents as in
the classical inequalities on regular domains. Our approach relies upon new
representation formulas for Sobolev functions, and on ensuing pointwise
estimates which hold in any open set.

the space-time, we adopt some general ideas of the General Theory of
Relativity, like the assumption of invariance of the most general physical laws
in every inertial and non-inertial coordinate system and equivalence of
factious forces in non-inertial coordinate systems and the force of gravity.
Moreover, in the frames of our model, we obtain that the laws of

applications including determining the strength of molecular processes such as
solvation and binding. It has been recently shown that when removing the VDW
and Coulomb potential terms of a group of atoms in a molecule by performing a
transformation, the molecule can be treated as non interacting systems in the
free energy calculation. This treatment is applicable both when the molecule is
in vacuum and in liquid and enables a very simple calculation of the free
energies associated with the potentials that depend on the relative spherical
coordinates of these atoms. Here we demonstrate the method in the free energy
calculation of a Methanethiol molecule and compare the results to these
obtained by MD simulations in vacuum and in water. The comparison shows
agreement between the results and faster computation when using the method by
factors varying between 5000 and 10^(12) for the same computational resources.

surveys can provide numerous false detections.In the case of a deferred
processing of survey images, this implies reconstructing complete light curves
for all detections, requiring sizable processing time and resources.Optimizing
the detection of transient events is thus an important issue for both present
and future surveys.We present here the optimization done in the SuperNova
Legacy Survey (SNLS) for the 5-year data deferred photometric analysis. In this
analysis, detections are derived from stacks of subtracted images with one
stack per lunation.The 3-year analysis provided 300,000 detections dominated by
signals of bright objects that were not perfectly subtracted.Allowing these
artifacts to be detected leads not only to a waste of resources but also to
possible signal coordinate contamination.We developed a subtracted image stack
treatment to reduce the number of non SN-like events using morphological
component analysis.This technique exploits the morphological diversity of
objects to be detected to extract the signal of interest.At the level of our
subtraction stacks, SN-like events are rather circular objects while most
spurious detections exhibit different shapes.A two-step procedure was necessary
to have a proper evaluation of the noise in the subtracted image stacks and
thus a reliable signal extraction.We also set up a new detection strategy to
obtain coordinates with good resolution for the extracted signal.SNIa MC
generated images were used to study detection efficiency and coordinate
resolution.When tested on SNLS 3 data this procedure decreases the number of
detections by a factor of two, while losing only 10% of SN-like events, almost
all faint.MC results show that SNIa detection efficiency is equivalent to that
of the original method for bright events, while the coordinate resolution is
improved.
