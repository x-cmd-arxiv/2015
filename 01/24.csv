unsupervised manner by setting seed cells, selected according to two criteria:

dynamical systems, based on a nilpotency property of its flow: it can be
explicitly described as a polynomial on its evolution parameter. Such a
property is established in a purely geometric--algebraic language, in terms
both of the algebra of all higher-order constants of the motion (named the
nilpotent algebra of the dynamics), and of a maximal Abelian algebra of
symmetries (called a Cartan subalgebra of the dynamics). It is shown that this
notion of integrability amounts to the annihilator of the nilpotent algebra
being contained in a Cartan subalgebra of the dynamics. Systems exhibiting this
property will be said to be nilpotent integrable.
  Our notion of nilpotent integrability offers a new insight into the intrinsic
dynamical properties of a system, which is independent of any auxiliary
geometric structure defined on its phase space. At the same time, it extends in
a natural way the classical concept of complete integrability for Hamiltonian
systems. An algebraic reduction procedure valid for nilpotent integrable
systems, generalizing the well-known reduction procedures for symplectic and/or
Poisson systems on appropriate quotient spaces, is also discussed. In
particular, it is shown that a large class of nilpotent integrable systems can
be obtained by reduction of higher-order free systems. The case of the
third-order free system is analyzed and a nontrivial set of third-order
Calogero-Moser-like nilpotent integrable equations is obtained.

have been proposed as an alternative to multiple-visits methods to relax the
assumption of closed population. Knape and Korner-Nievergelt (2015) showed that
under certain models of probability of detection single-visit methods are
statistically non-identifiable leading to biased population estimates. There is
a close relationship between estimation of the resource selection probability
function (RSPF) using weighted distributions and single-visit methods for
occupancy and abundance estimation. We explain the precise mathematical
conditions needed for RSPF estimation as stated in Lele and Keim (2006). The
identical conditions, that remained unstated in our papers on single-visit
methodology, are needed for single-visit methodology to work. We show that the
class of admissible models is quite broad and does not excessively restrict the
application of the RSPF or the single-visit methodology. To complement the work
by Knape and Korner-Nievergelt, we study the performance of multiple-visit
methods under the scaled logistic detection function and a much wider set of
situations. In general, under the scaled logistic detection function
multiple-visits methods also lead to biased estimates. As a solution to this
problem, we extend the single-visit methodology to a class of models that
allows use of scaled probability function. We propose a Multinomial extension
of single visit methodology that can be used to check whether the detection
function satisfies the RSPF condition or not. Furthermore, we show that if the
scaling factor depends on covariates, then it can also be estimated.

with sequence-dependent setup times, usually referred as $1|s_{ij}|\sum
w_jT_j$. In this $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problem, each job has an associated
processing time, due date and a weight. For each pair of jobs $i$ and $j$,
there may be a setup time before starting to process $j$ in case this job is
scheduled immediately after $i$. The objective is to determine a schedule that
minimizes the total weighted tardiness, where the tardiness of a job is equal
to its completion time minus its due date, in case the job is completely
processed only after its due date, and is equal to zero otherwise. Due to its
complexity, this problem is most commonly solved by heuristics. The aim of this
work is to develop a simple yet effective limitation strategy that speeds up
the local search procedure without a significant loss in the solution quality.
Such strategy consists of a filtering mechanism that prevents unpromising moves
to be evaluated. The proposed strategy has been embedded in a local search
based metaheuristic from the literature and tested in classical benchmark
instances. Computational experiments revealed that the limitation strategy
enabled the metaheuristic to be extremely competitive when compared to other
algorithms from the literature, since it allowed the use of a large number of
neighborhood structures without a significant increase in the CPU time and,
consequently, high quality solutions could be achieved in a matter of seconds.
In addition, we analyzed the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in two
other well-known metaheuristics. Further experiments were also carried out on
benchmark instances of problem $1|s_{ij}|\sum T_j$.

cubic scaling with respect to the size of the system, making big calculations
extremely expensive. This cubic scaling can be avoided by the use of so-called
linear scaling algorithms, which have been developed during the last few
decades. In this way it becomes possible to perform ab-initio calculations for
several tens of thousands of atoms or even more within a reasonable time frame.
However, even though the use of linear scaling algorithms is physically well
justified, their implementation often introduces some small errors.
Consequently most implementations offering such a linear complexity either
yield only a limited accuracy or, if one wants to go beyond this restriction,
require a tedious fine tuning of many parameters. In our linear scaling
approach within the BigDFT package, we were able to overcome this restriction.
Using an ansatz based on localized support functions expressed in an underlying
Daubechies wavelet basis -- which offers ideal properties for accurate linear
scaling calculations -- we obtain an amazingly high accuracy and a universal
applicability while still keeping the possibility of simulating large systems
with only a moderate demand of computing resources.

We find that the spectral weight of quasiparticles in these compounds deviates

to the same conclusion: those of iron ions in Fe3Si which occupy the positions,
where they are surrounded by only Fe ions, have the d-electrons localized and
large magnetic moment whereas Fe ions with the Si nearest neighbors have
d-electrons delocalized and the magnetic moments quenched. The Si influence on
the Fe ion state is even more pronounced in the FeSi2 where all iron ions have

l=(352+/-10) deg, b=(37+/-10) deg or l=(144+/-10) deg, b=(24+/-10) deg . The
mean radius of the rings is (324 +/- 10) km. One can use the rotational
lightcurve amplitude of Chiron at different epochs to distinguish between the
two solutions for the pole. Both imply lower lightcurve amplitude in 2013 than
in 1988, when the rotational lightcurve was first determined. We derived
Chiron's rotational lightcurve in 2013 from observations at the 1.23-m CAHA
telescope and indeed its amplitude is smaller than in 1988. We also present a
rotational lightcurve in 2000 from images taken at CASLEO 2.15-m telescope that
is consistent with our predictions. Out of the two poles the l=(144+/-10) deg,
b=(24+/-10) deg solution provides a better match to a compilation of rotational
lightcurve amplitudes from the literature and those presented here. We also
show that using this preferred pole, Chiron's long term brightness variations
are compatible with a simple model that incorporates the changing brightness of
the rings as the tilt angle with respect to the Earth changes with time. Also,
the variability of the water ice band in Chiron's spectra in the literature can
be explained to a large degree by an icy ring system whose tilt angle changes
with time and whose composition includes water ice, analogously to the case of
Chariklo. We present several possible formation scenarios for the rings from
qualitative points of view and speculate on the reasons why rings might be
common in centaurs. We speculate on whether the known bimodal color
distribution of centaurs could be due to presence of rings and lack of them.

threat to life on Earth, primarily through depletion of stratospheric ozone and
subsequent increase in surface-level solar ultraviolet radiation. Simulations
of the atmospheric effects of a variety of events (such as supernovae,
gamma-ray bursts, and solar proton events) have been previously published,
along with estimates of biological damage at Earth's surface. In this work, we
employed the TUV radiative transfer model to expand and improve calculations of
surface-level irradiance and biological impacts following an ionizing radiation
event. We considered changes in surface-level UVB, UVA, and photosynthetically
active radiation (visible light) for clear-sky conditions and fixed aerosol
parameter values. We also considered a wide range of biological effects on
organisms ranging from humans to phytoplankton. We found that past work
overestimated UVB irradiance, but that relative estimates for increase in
exposure to DNA damaging radiation are still similar to our improved
calculations. We also found that the intensity of biologically damaging
radiation varies widely with organism and specific impact considered; these
results have implications for biosphere-level damage following astrophysical
ionizing radiation events. When considering changes in surface-level visible
light irradiance, we found that, contrary to previous assumptions, a decrease
in irradiance is only present for a short time in very limited geographical
areas; instead we found a net increase for most of the modeled time-space
region. This result has implications for proposed climate changes associated

a small relative velocity and thus a low collision energy, and (ii) by storing

proteins and protein complexes to be determined from images of non-crystalline
specimens. Cryo-EM data analysis requires electron microscope images of
randomly oriented ice-embedded protein particles to be rotated and translated
to allow for coherent averaging when calculating three-dimensional (3D)
structures. Rotation of 2D images is usually done with the assumption that the
magnification of the electron microscope is the same in all directions.
However, due to electron optical aberrations, this condition is not met with
some electron microscopes when used with the settings necessary for cryo-EM
with a direct detector device (DDD) camera. Correction of images by linear
interpolation in real space has allowed high-resolution structures to be
calculated from cryo-EM images for symmetric particles. Here we describe and
compare a simple real space method, a simple Fourier space method, and a
somewhat more sophisticated Fourier space method to correct images for a
measured anisotropy in magnification. Further, anisotropic magnification causes
contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters estimated from image power spectra
to have an apparent systematic astigmatism. To address this problem we develop
an approach to adjust CTF parameters measured from distorted images so that
they can be used with corrected images. The effect of anisotropic magnification
on CTF parameters provides a simple way of detecting magnification anisotropy

  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The minimum energy, and, more generally, the minimum cost, to transmit one
bit of information has been recently derived for bursty communication when
information is available infrequently at random times at the transmitter.
Furthermore, it has been shown that even if the receiver is constrained to
sample only a fraction $\rho\in (0,1]$ of the channel outputs, there is no
capacity penalty. That is, for any strictly positive sampling rate $\rho>0$,
the asynchronous capacity per unit cost is the same as under full sampling,
i.e., when $\rho=1$. Moreover, there is no penalty in terms of decoding delay.
  The above results are asymptotic in nature, considering the limit as the
number $B$ of bits to be transmitted tends to infinity, while the sampling rate
$\rho$ remains fixed. A natural question is then whether the sampling rate
$\rho(B)$ can drop to zero without introducing a capacity (or delay) penalty
compared to full sampling. We answer this question affirmatively. The main
result of this paper is an essentially tight characterization of the minimum
sampling rate. We show that any sampling rate that grows at least as fast as
$\omega(1/B)$ is achievable, while any sampling rate smaller than $o(1/B)$
yields unreliable communication. The key ingredient in our improved
achievability result is a new, multi-phase adaptive sampling scheme for
locating transient changes, which we believe may be of independent interest for
certain change-point detection problems.

AMS-02 satellite confirm and extends the evidence on the existence of a new
(yet unknown) source of high energy positrons. To explain this excess, we use
the gravitino of bilinear R-parity violating SUSY models as a decaying Dark
Matter candidate, as the source of those high energy particles. Being a long
lived weak-interacting and spin 3/2 particle, it offers several particularities
which makes it an attractive candidate. We compute the electron, positron and
$\gamma$-ray\ fluxes produced by each gravitino decay channel at the Earth.
Combining the flux from the different decay modes we can fit AMS-02
measurements of the positron fraction, as well as the electron and positron
fluxes, with a gravitino mass in the range $1-2$ TeV and lifetimes of $\sim
1.0-0.8\times 10^{26}$ s. . Then, we study the viability of these scenarios
through their implications in $\gamma$-ray observations. We set limits on the
gravitino lifetime using the Extragalactic $\gamma$-ray Background recently
reported by the {\it Fermi}-LAT Collaboration and a state-of-the-art model of
its known contributors. These limits exclude the gravitino parameter space
which provides an acceptable explanation of the AMS-02 data. Therefore, we
conclude that the gravitino of bilinear R-parity violating models is ruled out
as the unique primary source of electrons and positrons needed to explain the
rise in the positron fraction.

there is a smooth 2-dimensional center manifold $W^c$ where the restriction of
the diffeomorphism has the elliptic fixed point supposed to be generic (no
strong resonances and first Birkhoff coefficient is nonzero). Moser's theorem
guarantees the existence of a positive measure set of KAM invariant curves.
$W^c$ itself is a normally hyperbolic manifold in the whole phase space and due
to Fenichel results every point on $W^c$ has 1-dimensional stable and unstable

invariant curve has stable and unstable smooth 2-dimensional invariant

spectra, the H Lyman alpha profiles exhibit prominent, blueshifted emission out
to Doppler shifts exceeding -1000 km/s in three HII-dominated and two

hydrogen and become optically thin to the Lyman continuum in the most advanced
mergers. We show that the properties of the highly blueshifted line wings on
the H Lyman alpha and optical emission-line profiles are consistent with
emission from clumps of gas condensing out of a fast, hot wind. The luminosity
of the H Lyman alpha emission increases non-linearly with the ULIRG bolometric
luminosity and represents about 0.1 to 1% of the radiative cooling from the hot
winds in the HII-dominated ULIRGs.

by combining a set of cosmological N-body simulations to calculate the
contributions of different spherical overdensity regions, Friends-of-Friends
(FoF) groups and matter outside haloes to the power spectrum. We find that
matter inside spherical overdensity regions of size R200,mean cannot account
for all power for 1<k<100 h/Mpc, regardless of the minimum halo mass. At most,
it accounts for 95% of the power (k>20 h/Mpc). For 2<k<10 h/Mpc, haloes with
mass M200,mean<10^11 Msun/h contribute negligibly to the power spectrum, and
our results appear to be converged with decreasing halo mass. When haloes are
taken to be regions of size R200,crit, the amount of power unaccounted for is
larger on all scales. Accounting also for matter inside FoF groups but outside
R200,mean increases the contribution of halo matter on most scales probed here
by 5-15%. Matter inside FoF groups with M200,mean>10^9 Msun/h accounts for
essentially all power for 3<k<100 h/Mpc. We therefore expect halo models that

host giant planets than stars with low metallicity. Yet the connection between
host star metallicity and the properties of small planets is only just
beginning to be investigated. It has recently been argued that the metallicity
distribution of stars with exoplanet candidates identified by Kepler provides
evidence for three distinct clusters of exoplanets, distinguished by planet
radius boundaries at 1.7 R_Earth and 3.9 R_Earth. This would suggest that there
are three distinct planet formation pathways for super-Earths, mini-Neptunes,
and giant planets. However, as I show through three independent analyses, there
is actually no evidence for the proposed radius boundary at 1.7 R_Earth. On the
other hand, a more rigorous calculation demonstrates that a single, continuous
relationship between planet radius and metallicity is a better fit to the data.
The planet radius and metallicity data therefore provides no evidence for
distinct categories of small planets. This suggests that the planet formation
process in a typical protoplanetary disk produces a continuum of planet sizes
between 1 R_Earth and 4 R_Earth. As a result, the currently available planet
radius and metallicity data for solar-metallicity F and G stars give no reason
to expect that the amount of solid material in a protoplanetary disk determines
whether super-Earths or mini-Neptunes are formed.

Significant correlated variability is found in the continuum and broad emission
lines, with amplitudes ranging from ~30% to a factor of two in the emission
lines and a factor of three in the continuum. The variations of all the strong
emission lines lag behind those of the continuum, with He II 1640 lagging
behind the continuum by ~2.5 days and Lyman alpha 1215, C IV 1550, and Si IV
1400 lagging by ~5-6 days. The relationship between the continuum and emission
lines is complex. In particular, during the second half of the campaign, all
emission-line lags increased by a factor of 1.3-2 and differences appear in the
detailed structure of the continuum and emission-line light curves.
Velocity-resolved cross-correlation analysis shows coherent structure in lag
versus line-of-sight velocity for the emission lines; the high-velocity wings
of C IV respond to continuum variations more rapidly than the line core,
probably indicating higher velocity BLR clouds at smaller distances from the
central engine. The velocity-dependent response of Lyman alpha, however, is
more complex and will require further analysis.

probabilistic estimates of morphology from Galaxy Zoo. We find a clear
difference between the quenching timescales preferred by smooth- and disc-like
galaxies, with three possible routes through the green valley dominated by
smooth- (rapid timescales, attributed to major mergers), intermediate-
(intermediate timescales, attributed to minor mergers and galaxy interactions)
and disc-like (slow timescales, attributed to secular evolution) galaxies. We
hypothesise that morphological changes occur in systems which have undergone
quenching with an exponential timescale \tau < 1.5 Gyr, in order for the
evolution of galaxies in the green valley to match the ratio of smooth to disc
galaxies observed in the red sequence. These rapid timescales are instrumental
in the formation of the red sequence at earlier times; however we find that
galaxies currently passing through the green valley typically do so at
intermediate timescales.

Here we assume that the low energy effective theory (for scales much below the
compositeness scale) corresponds to the Standard Model with a pNGB Higgs
doublet and a pNGB DM multiplet. We derive general effective DM Lagrangians for
several possible DM representations (under the SM gauge group), including the
singlet, doublet and triplet cases. Within this framework we discuss how the DM
observables (relic abundance, direct and indirect detection) constrain the
dimension-6 operators induced by the strong sector assuming that DM behaves as

specific cosets: $SO(6)/SO(5)$ and $SO(6)/SO(4) \times SO(2)$, which contain a
singlet and doublet DM candidate, respectively. In particular we show that if
compositeness is a solution to the little hierarchy problem, representations
larger than the triplet are strongly disfavored. Furthermore, we find that

seeds with masses M > 10000 solar masses that form by the direct collapse of
metal-free gas in atomic cooling halos in which H2 cooling is suppressed by a
strong extragalactic radiation field. The viability of this model depends on
the strength of the radiation field required to suppress H2 cooling, $J_{\rm

we use a reaction-based reduction technique to analyze the chemistry of H2 in

observations of the debris disk surrounding HD 15115, an F-type star with a
putative membership in the beta Pictoris moving group. This nearly edge-on
debris disk shows an extreme asymmetry in optical scattered light, with an
extent almost two times larger to the west of the star than to the east
(originally dubbed the ""Blue Needle""). The SMA observations reveal resolved
emission that we model as a circumstellar belt of thermal dust emission. This
belt extends to a radius of ~110 AU, coincident with the break in the scattered
light profile convincingly seen on the western side of the disk. This outer
edge location is consistent with the presence of an underlying population of
dust-producing planetesimals undergoing a collisional cascade, as hypothesized
in ""birth ring"" theory. In addition, the millimeter emission shows a ~3 sigma
feature aligned with the asymmetric western extension of the scattered light
disk. If this millimeter extension is real, then mechanisms for asymmetry that
affect only small grains, such as interactions with interstellar gas, are
disfavored. This tentative feature might be explained by secular perturbations
to grain orbits introduced by neutral gas drag, as previously invoked to
explain asymmetric morphologies of other, similar debris disks.

canonical pattern recognition problem. With this motivation, we present a novel
top tagging algorithm based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), one of the
most popular approaches to pattern recognition. The ANN is trained on a large
sample of boosted tops and light quark/gluon jets, and is then applied to
independent test samples. The ANN tagger demonstrated excellent performance in
a Monte Carlo study: for example, for jets with p_T in the 1100-1200 GeV range,
60% top-tag efficiency can be achieved with a 4% mis-tag rate. We discuss the
physical features of the jets identified by the ANN tagger as the most
important for classification, as well as correlations between the ANN tagger

model considers a classical semiconductor where conducting bands are affected
by the strong Weiss exchange field that arises from the magnetic order in the
substance. The field--caused shifts of the conducting bands results in the
change in the number of thermally activated carriers, and this change is
presumed to be responsible for the resistivity dependences on temperature and
magnetic field and for the CMR itself. Employing this model we calculate this
hypothetical Weiss field from the experimental data for various CMR manganites
employing minimal set of the adjustable parameters, namely two. The obtained
Weiss field behaves with temperature and external field similarly to the local

describing the type and degree of order in a system. For example, crystals
consist of spatially ordered arrays of atoms, an order that is lost as the
crystal melts. Like- wise in ferromagnets, the magnetic moments of the
constituent particles align only below the Curie temperature, TC. These two
examples reflect two classes of phase transitions: the melting of a crystal is
a first-order phase transition (the crystalline order vanishes abruptly) and
the onset of magnetism is a second- order phase transition (the magnetization
increases continuously from zero as the temperature falls below TC). Such
magnetism is robust in systems with localized magnetic particles, and yet rare
in model itinerant systems where the particles are free to move about. Here for
the first time, we explore the itinerant magnetic phases present in a spin-1
spin-orbit coupled atomic Bose gas; in this system, itinerant ferromagnetic
order is stabilized by the spin-orbit coupling, vanishing in its absence. We
first located a second-order phase transition that continuously stiffens until,
at a tricritical point, it transforms into a first- order transition (with
observed width as small as h x 4 Hz). We then studied the long-lived metastable
states associated with the first-order transition. These measurements are all
in agreement with theory.

properties. We calculate the radial column density profiles of the filaments
every 0.05 Myr and fit the profiles with the modified isothermal and pressure
confined isothermal cylinder models, finding reasonable fits for either model.
The filaments formed in the simulations have similar radial column density
profiles to those observed. Magnetic fields provide additional pressure support
to the filaments, making `puffier' filaments less prone to fragmentation than
in the pure hydrodynamic case, which continue to condense at a slower rate. In
the higher density simulations, the filaments grow faster through the increased
importance of gravity. Not all of the filaments identified in the simulations
will evolve to form stars: some expand and disperse. Given these different
filament evolutionary paths, the trends in bulk filament width as a function of
time, magnetic field strength, or density, are weak, and all cases are
reasonably consistent with the finding of a constant filament width in
different star-forming regions. In the simulations, the mean FWHM lies between
0.06 and 0.26 pc for all times and initial conditions, with most lying between
0.1 to 0.15 pc; the range in FWHMs are, however, larger than seen in typical

from the central server to the end users. Recently, the technique of coded
caching was introduced whereby coding in the caches and coded transmission
signals from the central server are considered. Prior results in this area
demonstrate that carefully designing the placement of content in the caches and
designing appropriate coded delivery signals from the server allow for a system
where the delivery rates can be significantly smaller than conventional
schemes. However, matching upper and lower bounds on the transmission rate have
not yet been obtained. In this work, we derive tighter lower bounds on the
coded caching rate than were known previously. We demonstrate that this problem
can equivalently be posed as a combinatorial problem of optimally labeling the
leaves of a directed tree. Our proposed labeling algorithm allows for
significantly improved lower bounds on the coded caching rate. Furthermore, we
study certain structural properties of our algorithm that allow us to
analytically quantify improvements on the rate lower bound for general values
of the problem parameters. This allows us to obtain a multiplicative gap of at
most four between the achievable rate and our lower bound.

universe and are therefore important for galaxy evolution studies and for
providing clues to the nature of the epoch of reionization, but the exact
circumstances under which Lyman alpha escapes a galaxy are still not fully
understood.
  Aims. The Trident project is designed to simultaneously examine Lyman alpha,
H-alpha and Lyman Continuum emission from galaxies at redshift z~2, thus
linking together these three aspects of ionising radiation in galaxies. In this
paper, we outline the strategy of this project and examine the properties of
LAEs in the GOODS North field.
  Methods. We performed a narrowband LAE survey in GOODS North using existing
and two custom made filters at the Nordic Optical Telescope with MOSCA. We use
complementary broad band archival data in the field to make a careful candidate
selection and perform optical to near-IR SED fitting. We also estimate
far-infrared luminosities by matching our candidates to detections in
Spitzer/MIPS 24{\mu}m and Herschel/PACS catalogs.
  Results. We find a total of 25 LAE candidates, probing mainly the bright end
of the LAE luminosity function with L_Ly {\alpha} ~ 1-15e42 erg/s. They display
a range of masses of ~0.5-50e9 M_solar, and average ages from a few tens of Myr
to 1 Gyr when assuming a constant star formation history. The majority of our
candidates also show signs of recent elevated star formation. Three candidates
have counterparts in the GOODS-Herschel far-IR catalogue, with luminosities
consistent with ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs).
  Conclusions. The wide range of parameters derived from our SED fitting, as
well as part of our sample being detected as ULIRGs, seems to indicate that at
these Lyman alpha luminosities, LAEs do not necessarily have to be young
dwarfs, and that a lack of dust is not required for Lyman alpha to escape.

to the finite number of macroparticles in PIC codes. It is shown that it is
appropriate to choose higher order shape functions of the macroparticles
compared to a larger number of macroparticles per cell. This allows to estimate
better the anisotropic electron heating due to the collisions of macroparticles
in a PIC code. Temperature anisotropies can stabilize the tearing mode
instability and trigger additional current sheet instabilities. We found a good
agreement between the analytically derived threshold for the stabilization of
the anisotropic tearing mode and other instabilities, either spontaneously
developing or initially triggered ones. Numerical effects causing anisotropic
heating at electron time scales, become especially important for higher mass
ratios (above $m_i/m_e = 180$). If numerical effects are carefully taken into

matched filter (ANMF) for radar detection. It is well-acknowledged that the
estimation of the noise-clutter covariance matrix is a fundamental step in
adaptive radar detection. In this paper, we consider regularized estimation
methods which force by construction the eigenvalues of the scatter estimates to
be greater than a positive regularization parameter rho. This makes them more
suitable for high dimensional problems with a limited number of secondary data
samples than traditional sample covariance estimates. While an increase of rho
seems to improve the conditioning of the estimate, it might however cause it to
significantly deviate from the true covariance matrix. The setting of the
optimal regularization parameter is a difficult question for which no
convincing answers have thus far been provided. This constitutes the major
motivation behind our work. More specifically, we consider the design of the
ANMF detector for two kinds of regularized estimators, namely the regularized
sample covariance matrix (RSCM), appropriate when the clutter follows a
Gaussian distribution and the regularized Tyler estimator (RTE) for
non-Gaussian spherically invariant distributed clutters. Based on recent random
matrix theory results studying the asymptotic fluctuations of the statistics of
the ANMF detector when the number of samples and their dimension grow together
to infinity, we propose a design for the regularization parameter that
maximizes the detection probability under constant false alarm rates.
Simulation results which support the efficiency of the proposed method are
provided in order to illustrate the gain of the proposed optimal design over
conventional settings of the regularization parameter.

been achieved. In contrast, little is known about the organization and function

simultaneously monitor electrical activity of a large number of neurons in real

the Green's function of infinite pristine systems and an adaptive recursive
Green's function technique for the patches. The method allows for an efficient
calculation of both local electronic and transport properties, as well as the
inclusion of multiple probes in arbitrary geometries embedded in extended
samples. We apply the Patched Green's function method to evaluate the local
densities of states and transmission properties of graphene systems with two
kinds of deviations from the pristine structure: bubbles and perforations with
characteristic dimensions of the order of 10-25 nm, i.e. including hundreds of
thousands of atoms. The strain field induced by a bubble is treated beyond an
effective Dirac model, and we demonstrate the existence of both Friedel-type
oscillations arising from the edges of the bubble, as well as pseudo-Landau
levels related to the pseudomagnetic field induced by the nonuniform strain.
Secondly, we compute the transport properties of a large perforation with
atomic positions extracted from a TEM image, and show that current vortices may

thought to be interesting sources of Gravitational Waves (GWs) for current and
next generation ground based detectors, such as Advanced LIGO and the Einstein
Telescope. The main reason is that many of the NS in these systems appear to be
spinning well below their Keplerian breakup frequency, and it has been
suggested that torques associated with GW emission may be setting the observed
spin period. This assumption has been used extensively in the literature to
assess the strength of the likely gravitational wave signal. There is now,
however, a significant amount of theoretical and observation work that suggests
that this may not be the case, and that GW emission is unlikely to be setting
the spin equilibrium period in many systems. In this paper we take a different
starting point and predict the GW signal strength for two physical mechanisms
that are likely to be at work in LMXBs: crustal mountains due to thermal
asymmetries and magnetically confined mountains. We find that thermal crustal
mountains in transient LMXBs are unlikely to lead to detectable GW emission,
while persistent systems are good candidates for detection by Advanced LIGO and
by the Einstein Telescope. Detection prospects are pessimistic for the magnetic
mountain case, unless the NS has a buried magnetic field of $B\approx 10^{12}$
G, well above the typically inferred exterior dipole fields of these objects.
Nevertheless, if a system were to be detected by a GW observatory, cyclotron
resonant scattering features in the X-ray emission could be used to distinguish
between the two different scenarios.

""probabilistic models"") for Bell-type quantum non-locality experiments. A
derivation of this set from simple physical or information theoretic principles
would represent an important step forward in our understanding of quantum
mechanics, and this problem has been intensely investigated in recent years.
""Macroscopic locality,"" which requires the recovery of locality in the limit of
large numbers of trials, is one of several principles discussed in the
literature that place a bound on the set of quantum probabilistic models.
  A similar question can also be asked about probabilistic models for the more
general class of quantum contextuality experiments. Here, we extend the
Macroscopic Locality principle to this more general setting, using the
hypergraph approach of Ac\'in, Fritz, Leverrier and Sainz [Comm. Math. Phys.
334(2), 533-628 (2015)], which provides a framework to study both phenomena of
nonlocality and contextuality in a unified manner. We find that the set of
probabilistic models allowed by our Macroscopic Non-Contextuality principle is
equivalent to an important and previously studied set in this formalism, which
is slightly larger than the quantum set. In the particular case of Bell
Scenarios, this set is equivalent to the set of ""Almost Quantum"" models, which
is of particular interest since the latter was recently shown to satisfy all
but one of the principles that have been proposed to bound quantum
probabilistic models, without being implied by any of them (or even their
conjunction). Our condition is the first characterisation of the almost quantum
set from a simple physical principle.

(3LAC) is presented. It is based on the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL) of
sources detected between 100 MeV and 300 GeV with a Test Statistic (TS) greater
than 25, between 2008 August 4 and 2012 July 31. The 3LAC includes 1591 AGNs
located at high Galactic latitudes (|b|>10{\deg}), a 71% increase over the
second catalog based on 2 years of data. There are 28 duplicate associations,
thus 1563 of the 2192 high-latitude gamma-ray sources of the 3FGL catalog are
AGNs. Most of them (98%) are blazars. About half of the newly detected blazars
are of unknown type, i.e., they lack spectroscopic information of sufficient
quality to determine the strength of their emission lines. Based on their
gamma-ray spectral properties, these sources are evenly split between
flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL~Lacs. The most abundant detected
BL~Lacs are of the high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP) type. About 50% of the BL~Lacs
have no measured redshifts. A few new rare outliers (HSP-FSRQs and
high-luminosity HSP BL~Lacs) are reported. The general properties of the 3LAC
sample confirm previous findings from earlier catalogs. The fraction of 3LAC
blazars in the total population of blazars listed in BZCAT remains
non-negligible even at the faint ends of the BZCAT-blazar radio, optical and
X-ray flux distributions, which is a clue that even the faintest known blazars
could eventually shine in gamma rays at LAT-detection levels. The energy-flux
distributions of the different blazar populations are in good agreement with
extrapolation from earlier catalogs.

supernova (SLSN) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We briefly discuss the data
and search algorithm used to find this event in the first year of DES
operations, and outline the spectroscopic data obtained from the European
Southern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope to confirm its redshift (z =
0.663 +/- 0.001 based on the host-galaxy emission lines) and likely spectral
type (type I). Using this redshift, we find M_U_peak = -21.05 +0.10 -0.09 for
the peak, rest-frame U-band absolute magnitude, and find DES13S2cmm to be
located in a faint, low metallicity (sub-solar), low stellar-mass host galaxy
(log(M/M_sun) = 9.3 +/- 0.3); consistent with what is seen for other SLSNe-I.
We compare the bolometric light curve of DES13S2cmm to fourteen similarly
well-observed SLSNe-I in the literature and find it possesses one of the
slowest declining tails (beyond +30 days rest frame past peak), and is the
faintest at peak. Moreover, we find the bolometric light curves of all SLSNe-I
studied herein possess a dispersion of only 0.2-0.3 magnitudes between +25 and
+30 days after peak (rest frame) depending on redshift range studied; this
could be important for 'standardising' such supernovae, as is done with the
more common type Ia. We fit the bolometric light curve of DES13S2cmm with two
competing models for SLSNe-I - the radioactive decay of 56Ni, and a magnetar -
and find that while the magnetar is formally a better fit, neither model
provides a compelling match to the data. Although we are unable to conclusively
differentiate between these two physical models for this particular SLSN-I,
further DES observations of more SLSNe-I should break this degeneracy,
especially if the light curves of SLSNe-I can be observed beyond 100 days in
the rest frame of the supernova.
