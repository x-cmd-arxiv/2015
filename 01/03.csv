on previous work by the authors, on how methods borrowed from physics can be
used to ""count"" an infinite number of points. We begin with the classical case
of counting integer points on the non-negative real axis and the classical
Euler-Maclaurin formula. As an intermediate stage, we count integer points on
product cones where the roles played by the coalgebra and the algebraic
Birkhoff factorization can be appreciated in a relatively simple setting. We
then consider the general case of (lattice) cones for which we introduce a
conilpotent coalgebra of cones, with applications to renormalization of conical
zeta values. When evaluated at zero arguments conical zeta functions indeed
""count"" integer points on cones.

  Networks","18 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Community detection in complex networks is a topic of high interest in many
fields. Bipartite networks are a special type of complex networks in which
nodes are decomposed into two disjoint sets, and only nodes between the two
sets can be connected. Bipartite networks represent diverse interaction
patterns in many real-world systems, such as predator-prey networks,
plant-pollinator networks, and drug-target networks. While community detection
in unipartite networks has been extensively studied in the past decade,
identification of modules or communities in bipartite networks is still in its
early stage. Several quantitative functions proposed for evaluating the quality
of bipartite network divisions are based on null models and have distinct
resolution limits. In this paper, we propose a new quantitative function for
community detection in bipartite networks, and demonstrate that this
quantitative function is superior to the widely used Barber's bipartite
modularity and other functions. Based on the new quantitative function, the
bipartite network community detection problem is formulated into an integer
programming model. Bipartite networks can be partitioned into reasonable
overlapping communities by maximizing the quantitative function. We further
develop a heuristic and adapted label propagation algorithm (BiLPA) to optimize
the quantitative function in large-scale bipartite networks. BiLPA does not
require any prior knowledge about the number of communities in the networks. We
apply BiLPA to both artificial networks and real-world networks and demonstrate
that this method can successfully identify the community structures of
bipartite networks.

computational content of computability-theoretic properties as well as the
computational content of theorems in one common setting. The properties that we
study include diagonal non-computability, hyperimmunity, complete consistent
extensions of Peano arithmetic, 1-genericity, Martin-L\""of randomness, and
cohesiveness. The theorems that we include in our case study are the low basis
theorem of Jockusch and Soare, the Kleene-Post theorem, and Friedberg's jump
inversion theorem. It turns out that all the aforementioned properties and many
theorems in computability theory, including all theorems that claim the
existence of some Turing degree, have very little uniform computational
content: they are located outside of the upper cone of binary choice (also
known as LLPO); we call problems with this property indiscriminative. Since
practically all theorems from classical analysis whose computational content
has been classified are discriminative, our observation could yield an
explanation for why theorems and results in computability theory typically have
very few direct consequences in other disciplines such as analysis. A notable
exception in our case study is the low basis theorem which is discriminative.
This is perhaps why it is considered to be one of the most applicable theorems
in computability theory. In some cases a bridge between the indiscriminative
world and the discriminative world of classical mathematics can be established
via a suitable residual operation and we demonstrate this in the case of the
cohesiveness problem and the problem of consistent complete extensions of Peano
arithmetic. Both turn out to be the quotient of two discriminative problems.

oscillating economies. This conclusion strongly contrasts with the prediction

to come up with notions of clusterability that distinguish realistically

provides a survey of recent papers along this line of research and a critical
evaluation their results. Our bottom line conclusion is that that CDNM thesis
is still far from being formally substantiated. We start by discussing which
requirements should be met in order to provide formal support the validity of
the CDNM thesis. In particular, we list some implied requirements for notions
of clusterability. We then examine existing results in view of those

Langevin dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem in three ways: it
generates proposed moves using only a subset of the data, it skips the
Metropolis-Hastings accept-reject step, and it uses sequences of decreasing
step sizes. In \cite{TehThierryVollmerSGLD2014}, we provided the mathematical
foundations for the decreasing step size SGLD, including consistency and a
central limit theorem. However, in practice the SGLD is run for a relatively
small number of iterations, and its step size is not decreased to zero. The
present article investigates the behaviour of the SGLD with fixed step size. In
particular we characterise the asymptotic bias explicitly, along with its
dependence on the step size and the variance of the stochastic gradient. On
that basis a modified SGLD which removes the asymptotic bias due to the
variance of the stochastic gradients up to first order in the step size is
derived. Moreover, we are able to obtain bounds on the finite-time bias,
variance and mean squared error (MSE). The theory is illustrated with a
Gaussian toy model for which the bias and the MSE for the estimation of moments
can be obtained explicitly. For this toy model we study the gain of the SGLD
over the standard Euler method in the limit of large data sets.

existing modelling formalisms are gene interaction graphs, where edges between
genes denote either an activation or inhibition relation. However, when
designing experiments, it is important to be precise about the low-level
mechanistic details as to how each such relation is implemented. The rule-based
modelling language Kappa allows to unambiguously specify mechanistic details
such as DNA binding sites, dimerisation of transcription factors, or
co-operative interactions. However, such a detailed description comes with
complexity and computationally costly execution. We propose a general method
for automatically transforming a rule-based program, by eliminating
intermediate species and adjusting the rate constants accordingly. Our method
consists of searching for those interaction patterns known to be amenable to
equilibrium approximations (e.g. Michaelis-Menten scheme). The reduced model is
efficiently obtained by static inspection over the rule-set, and it represents
a particular theoretical limit of the original model. The Bhattacharyya
distance is proposed as a metric to estimate the reduction error for a given
observable. The tool is tested on a detailed rule-based model of a
$\lambda$-phage switch, which lists $96$ rules and $16$ agents. The reduced
model has $11$ rules and $5$ agents, and provides a dramatic reduction in
simulation time of several orders of magnitude.

solution of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the analysis of a
generalized Thiele's equation, that inertial effects are almost completely
absent in skyrmion dynamics driven by a time-dependent current. In contrast,
the response to time-dependent magnetic forces and thermal fluctuations depends
strongly on frequency and is described by a large effective mass and a (anti-)
damping depending on the acceleration of the skyrmion. Thermal diffusion is
strongly suppressed by the cyclotron motion and is proportional to the Gilbert
damping coefficient $\alpha$. This indicates that the skyrmion position is
stable, and its motion responds to the time-dependent current without delay or
retardation even if it is fast. These findings demonstrate the advantages of
skyrmions as information carriers.

other models. After analysing ground states and phase diagrams for various
$\beta/\mu$, we study optical electric($\sigma$), thermoelectric($\alpha$), and

to causal inference and data driven decision making in many internet based
businesses. While a simple comparison between a treatment (the feature under
test) and a control (often the current standard), provides a starting point to
identify the cause of change in Key Performance Indicator (KPI), it is often
insufficient, as the change we wish to detect may be small, and inherent
variation contained in data may obscure movements in KPI. To have sufficient
power to detect statistically significant changes in KPI, an experiment needs
to engage a sufficiently large proportion of traffic to the site, and also last
for a sufficiently long duration. This limits the number of candidate
variations to be evaluated, and the speed new feature iterations. We introduce
more sophisticated experimental designs, specifically the repeated measures
design, including the crossover design and related variants, to increase KPI
sensitivity with the same traffic size and duration of experiment. In this
paper we present FORME (Flexible Online Repeated Measures Experiment), a
flexible and scalable framework for these designs. We evaluate the theoretic
basis, design considerations, practical guidelines and big data implementation.
We compare FORME to an existing methodology called mixed effect model and
demonstrate why FORME is more flexible and scalable. We present empirical
results based on both simulation and real data. Our method is widely applicable
to online experimentation to improve sensitivity in detecting movements in KPI,
and increase experimentation capability.

kiloparsec-scale jet flows in radio galaxies. Jets in Active Galactic Nuclei
are relativistic where they are first formed, but their speeds and compositions
change as they propagate. It has long been known that kiloparsec-scale jets in
radio galaxies can be divided into two flavours: strong (found in powerful
sources, narrow and terminating in compact hot-spots) and weak (found in
low-luminosity sources, geometrically flaring, unable to form hot-spots and
terminating in diffuse lobes or tails). We have developed methods to model AGN
jets as intrinsically symmetrical, relativistic flows by fitting to deep,
well-resolved radio images in Stokes I, Q and U. This has yielded a wealth of
information about the brightest few weak-flavour jets. Our first key objective
is to observe large samples of weak and transition jets at 0.1 - 0.5 arcsec
resolution with SKA1-MID. This would allow us to see how jet propagation
depends on power and environment and to quantify the energy and momentum input
into the IGM. We will require typical noise levels of 1 microJy/beam, and may
be able to exploit survey imaging in some cases. Our second, more challenging,
application is to determine the velocity fields in strong-flavour jets. Do they
have very fast spines with bulk Lorentz factors of 5 - 10? Is there evidence
for magnetic confinement by a toroidal field? What are their energy fluxes?
This is a major imaging challenge for SKA2: we need resolution better than 0.05
arcsec, ideally in the 1 - 10 GHz frequency range, with rms noise levels of
roughly 10 nJy/beam and extremely high dynamic range, imaging fidelity and
polarization purity.

modified to include recognition of other features such as inner, outer, and
nuclear lenses, nuclear rings, bars, and disks, spheroidal galaxies, X patterns

late-type systems (mostly bulgeless, pure disk galaxies) in the range Scd-Im.

that for types Scd to Sm is SB. The bars in these two type domains are very
different in mid-IR structure and morphology. This paper examines the bar,

finitely generated groups, there is a special type of unimodular graph height
function termed here a 'group height function'. A necessary and sufficient
condition for the existence of a group height function is presented, and may be

connective constants for Cayley graphs. Locality may thereby be established for
a variety of infinite groups including those with strictly positive deficiency.
  It is proved that a large class of Cayley graphs support unimodular graph
height functions, that are in addition harmonic on the graph. This implies, for
example, the existence of unimodular graph height functions for the Cayley
graphs of finitely generated solvable groups. It turns out that graphs with
non-unimodular automorphism subgroups also possess graph height functions, but
the resulting graph height functions need not be harmonic.
  Group height functions, as well as the graph height functions of the previous
paragraph, are non-constant harmonic functions with linear growth and an
additional property of having periodic differences. The existence of such
functions on Cayley graphs is a topic of interest beyond their applications in
the theory of self-avoiding walks.

translation-invariant systems, and candidate 1D models have been proposed. We
find that such models, in contrast to MBL systems with quenched disorder,
typically exhibit much more severe finite-size effects due to the presence of
two or more vastly different energy scales. In a finite system, this can easily
create an artificial splitting of the density of states (DOS) into bands
separated by large energy gaps. We argue that in order for such models to
faithfully represent the physics of the thermodynamic limit, the ratio of the
relevant coupling parameters must be larger than a certain cutoff that depends
on system size, and should be chosen in such a way that various bands in the
DOS of a given model overlap with one another. By setting the parameters in
this way to minimize the finite-size effects, we then perform exact
diagonalization studies of several translation-invariant MBL candidate models.
Based on the variety of diagnostics, including entanglement properties and the
behaviour of local observables, we find the systems exhibit thermal (ergodic),
rather than MBL-like behaviour. Our results suggest that MBL in
translation-invariant systems with two or more very different energy scales is
less robust than perturbative arguments suggest, possibly pointing to the
importance of non-perturbative effects which induce delocalization in the
thermodynamic limit.

Allowing for conditional heteroskedasticity is important in dynamic models as
the conditional error variance may be non-constant over time and depend on the
covariates. Furthermore, our procedure allows for inference on high-dimensional
subsets of the parameter vector of an increasing cardinality. We show that the
confidence bands resulting from our procedure are asymptotically honest and
contract at the optimal rate. This rate is different for the fixed effects than

behavioral repertoire by measuring motile trajectories of the canonical lab

trajectory dynamics over timescales spanning the transition from ballistic

motility statistics are captured by a random walk model with independent
dynamics in the speed, bearing and reversal events. We show that the model
parameters vary among species in a correlated, low-dimensional manner
suggestive of a common mode of behavioral control and a trade-off between
exploration and exploitation. The distribution of phenotypes along this primary
mode of variation reveals that not only the mean but also the variance varies
considerably across strains, suggesting that these nematode lineages employ
contrasting ``bet-hedging'' strategies for foraging.

XMM-Newton measurements of the emission from the Milky Way's hot halo. These
measurements are from 110 sight lines, spanning the full range of Galactic
longitudes. We find that a magnetohydrodynamical simulation of a
supernova-driven interstellar medium, which features a flow of hot gas from the
disk to the halo, reproduces the temperature but significantly underpredicts
the 0.5-2.0 keV surface brightness of the halo (by two orders of magnitude, if
we compare the median predicted and observed values). This is true for versions
of the model with and without an interstellar magnetic field. We consider
different reasons for the discrepancy between the model predictions and the
observations. We find taking into account overionization in cooled halo plasma,
which could in principle boost the predicted X-ray emission, is unlikely in
practice to bring the predictions in line with the observations. We also find
that including thermal conduction, which would tend to increase the surface
brightnesses of interfaces between hot and cold gas, would not overcome the
surface brightness shortfall. However, charge exchange emission from such
interfaces, not included in the current model, may be significant. The
faintness of the model may also be due to the lack of cosmic ray driving,
meaning that the model may underestimate the amount of material transported
from the disk to halo. In addition, an extended hot halo of accreted material
may be important, by supplying hot electrons that could boost the emission of
the material driven out from the disk. Additional model predictions are needed
to test the relative importance of these processes in explaining the observed
halo emission.

assembly of dwarf galaxies in both $\Lambda$ dominated, Cold (CDM) and
Self--Interacting (SIDM) dark matter models. The SIDM model adopts a constant
cross section of 2 $cm^{2}/g$, a relatively large value to maximize its
effects. These are the first SIDM simulations that are combined with a
description of stellar feedback that naturally drives potential fluctuations
able to create dark matter cores. Remarkably, SIDM fails to significantly lower
the central dark matter density at halo peak velocities V$_{max}$ $<$ 30 Km/s.
This is due to the fact that the central regions of very low--mass field halos
have relatively low central velocity dispersion and densities, leading to time
scales for SIDM collisions greater than a Hubble time. CDM halos with V$_{max}$
$<$ 30 km/s have inefficient star formation, and hence weak supernova feedback.
At a fixed 2 cm2/g SIDM cross section, the DM content of very low mass CDM and
SIDM halos differs by no more than a factor of two within 100-200pc. At larger
halo masses ($\sim$ 10$^{10}$ solar masses), the introduction of baryonic
processes creates field dwarf galaxies with dark matter cores and central
DM$+$baryon distributions that are effectively indistinguishable between CDM
and SIDM. Both models are in broad agreement with observed Local Group field
galaxies across the range of masses explored. To significantly differentiate
SIDM from CDM at the scale of faint dwarf galaxies, a velocity dependent cross
section that rapidly increases to values larger than 2 $cm^{2}/g$ for halos
with V$_{max}$ < 25-30 Km/s needs to be introduced.

universe emerged is still not clear. In the universe at $z\gtrsim 2$, galaxies
with various morphology are seen, and star-forming galaxies at $z\sim2$ show an
intrinsic shape of bar-like structure. Then, when did round disk structure
form? Here we take a simple and straightforward approach to see the epoch when
a round disk galaxy population emerged by constraining the intrinsic shape
statistically based on apparent axial ratio distribution of galaxies. We
derived the distributions of the apparent axial ratios in the rest-frame
optical light ($\sim 5000$ \AA) of star-forming main sequence galaxies at
$2.5>z>1.4$, $1.4>z>0.85$, and $0.85>z>0.5$, and found that the apparent axial
ratios of them show peaky distributions at $z\gtrsim0.85$, while a rather flat
distribution at the lower redshift. By using a tri-axial model ($A>B>C$) for
the intrinsic shape, we found the best-fit models give the peaks of the $B/A$
distribution of $0.81\pm0.04$, $0.84\pm0.04$, and $0.92\pm0.05$ at $2.5>z>1.4$,
$1.4>z>0.85$, and $0.85>z>0.5$, respectively. The last value is close to the
local value of 0.95. Thickness ($C/A$) is $\sim0.25$ at all the redshifts and
is close to the local value (0.21). The results indicate the shape of the
star-forming galaxies in the main sequence changes gradually, and the round
disk is established at around $z\sim0.9$. Establishment of the round disk may
be due to a cease of violent interaction of galaxies or a growth of a bulge
and/or a super-massive black hole resides at the center of a galaxy which
dissolves the bar structure.

well-identified drawbacks when the parameters are not well initialised. The

been shown to be an effective tool to combine ""weak"" predictors in regression

evaluate our approach on five well-know time-series benchmark problems.
Additionally, we compare this technique with a baseline approach that consists

observable universe is contained within one bubble among many, all inhabiting
the eternally inflating multiverse. One of the few way to test this idea is to
look for evidence of the relic inhomogeneities left by the collisions between
other bubbles and our own. Such relic inhomogeneities induces a coherent bulk
flow over gigaparsec scales. Therefore, bubble collisions leave unique imprints
in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) through the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich
(kSZ) effect, temperature anisotropies induced by the scattering of photons
from coherently moving free electrons in the diffuse intergalactic medium. The
kSZ signature produced by bubble collisions has a unique directional dependence
and is tightly correlated with the galaxy distribution; it can therefore be
distinguished from other contributions to the CMB anisotropies. An important
advantage of the kSZ signature is that it peaks on arcminute angular scales,
where the limiting factors in making a detection are instrumental noise and
foreground subtraction. This is in contrast to the collision signature in the
primary CMB, which peaks on angular scales much larger than one degree, and
whose detection is therefore limited by cosmic variance. In this paper, we
examine the prospects for probing the inhomogeneities left by bubble collisions
using the kSZ effect. We provide a forecast for detection using
cross-correlations between CMB and galaxy surveys, finding that the
detectability using the kSZ effect can be competitive with constraints from CMB
temperature and polarization data.

available schemes where the advection approximation is explicit, and the
collision approximation is either explicit or implicit. The comparison is done
by implementing these schemes on benchmark incompressible flow problems such as

brass particle near an acoustically soft plate patterned with a periodic deep
grating. The existence of a negative ARF by which the particle can be pulled
towards the sound source is confirmed. In addition, the bandwidth for negative
ARF in this soft-plate system is found to be considerably broader than in the
stiff-plate systems typically used in previous studies. It is further
demonstrated by field distribution analysis that the negative ARF is caused by
the gradient force induced by the gradient vortex velocity field near the
surface, which stems from the collective resonance excitation of the
antisymmetric coupling of Scholte surface waves in the thin plate. The effects
of particle location and size on the ARF were also investigated in detail. The
negative ARF has potential use in applications requiring particle manipulation
using acoustic waves.

signals provide positive feedback to ongoing motor commands, but this influence
decays as feedback weakens from response adaptation during syllable
repetitions. Computational models show that this mechanism explains repeat
distributions observed in Bengalese finch song. We experimentally confirmed two
predictions of this mechanism in Bengalese finches: removal of auditory
feedback by deafening reduces syllable repetitions; and neural responses to
auditory playback of repeated syllable sequences gradually adapt in

Result: In this work, we systematically analyze the TDS strategy in a rigorous
statistical sense. We prove that the commonly used concatenated TDS provides a
conservative estimate of the FDR for any given score threshold, but it cannot
rigorously control the FDR. We prove that with a slight modification to the
commonly used formula for FDR estimation, the peptide-level FDR can be
rigorously controlled based on the concatenated TDS. We show that the
spectrum-level FDR control is difficult. We verify the theoretical conclusions

primary interest is usually the parametric component which involves unknown
constant coefficients. First, we study semiparametric efficiency bound for
estimation of the constant coefficients in a general setup. It can be achieved
by spline regression provided that the within-cluster covariance matrices are
all known, which is an unrealistic assumption in reality. Thus, we propose an
adaptive estimator of the constant coefficients when the covariance matrices
are unknown and depend only on the index random variable, such as time, and
when the link function is the identity function. After preliminary estimation,
based on working independence and both spline and local linear regression, we
estimate the covariance matrices by applying local linear regression to the
resulting residuals. Then we employ the covariance matrix estimates and spline
regression to obtain our final estimators of the constant coefficients. The
proposed estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound under normality
assumption, and it has the smallest covariance matrix among a class of
estimators even when normality is violated. We also present results of
numerical studies. The simulation results demonstrate that our estimator is
superior to the one based on working independence. When applied to the CD4
count data, our method identifies an interesting structure that was not found

whole new opportunity to investigate novel many-body physics of fermions. In
this article, we review theoretical studies of the Fermi liquid theory and
Cooper pairing instabilities of both electric and magnetic dipolar fermionic
systems from the perspective of unconventional symmetries. When the electric
dipole moments are aligned by the external electric field, their interactions
exhibit the explicit $d_{r^2-3z^2}$ anisotropy. The Fermi liquid properties,
including the single-particle spectra, thermodynamic susceptibilities, and
collective excitations, are all affected by this anisotropy. The electric
dipolar interaction provides a mechanism for the unconventional spin triplet
Cooper pairing, which is different from the usual spin-fluctuation mechanism in
solids and the superfluid $^3$He. Furthermore, the competition between pairing
instabilities in the singlet and triplet channels gives rise to a novel
time-reversal symmetry breaking superfluid state. Unlike electric dipole
moments which are induced by electric fields and unquantized, magnetic dipole
moments are intrinsic proportional to the hyperfine-spin operators with a Lande
factor. Its effects even manifest in unpolarized systems exhibiting an
isotropic but spin-orbit coupled nature. The resultant spin-orbit coupled Fermi
liquid theory supports a collective sound mode exhibiting a topologically
non-trivial spin distribution over the Fermi surface. It also leads to a novel
$p$-wave spin triplet Cooper pairing state whose spin and orbital angular
momentum are entangled to the total angular momentum $J=1$ dubbed the
$J$-triplet pairing. This $J$-triplet pairing phase is different from both the
spin-orbit coupled $^3$He-$B$ phase with $J=0$ and the spin-orbit decoupled
$^3$He-$A$ phase.

invoked, the so-called LEPP (Light Element Primary Process). In this paper we
investigate possible alternative solutions. Basing on Full Network Stellar
evolutionary calculations, we investigate the effects on the Solar System
s-only distribution induced by the inclusion of some commonly ignored physical
processes (e.g. rotation) or by the variation of the treatment of convective
overshoot, mass-loss and the efficiency of nuclear processes. Our main findings
are: 1) at the epoch of the formation of the Solar System, our reference model
produces super-solar abundances for the whole s-only distribution, even in the
range 90<A<130; 2) within errors, the s-only distribution relative to 150Sm is
flat; 3) the s-process contribution of the less massive AGB stars (M<1.5 M_SUN)
as well as of the more massive ones (M>4.0 M_SUN) are negligible; 4) the
inclusion of rotation implies a downward shift of the whole distribution with
an higher efficiency for the heavy s-only isotopes, leading to a flatter s-only
distribution; 5) different prescriptions on convection or mass-loss produce
nearly rigid shifts of the whole distribution. In summary, a variation of the
standard paradigm of AGB nucleosynthesis would allow to reconcile models
predictions with Solar System s-only abundances. Nonetheless, the LEPP cannot
be definitely ruled out, because of the uncertainties still affecting stellar
and Galactic chemical evolution models.

how many training samples are sufficient to predict the future behaviour of an
unknown target function. This kind of problem is, arguably, one of the most
fundamental problems in statistical learning theory and the bounds for
practical settings can be completely characterised by a simple measure of
complexity.
  Our main result in the paper is that, for learning an unknown quantum
measurement, the upper bound, given by the fat-shattering dimension, is
linearly proportional to the dimension of the underlying Hilbert space.
Learning an unknown quantum state becomes a dual problem to ours, and as a
byproduct, we can recover Aaronson's famous result [Proc. R. Soc. A
463:3089-3144 (2007)] solely using a classical machine learning technique. In
addition, other famous complexity measures like covering numbers and Rademacher
complexities are derived explicitly. We are able to connect measures of sample
complexity with various areas in quantum information science, e.g. quantum
state/measurement tomography, quantum state discrimination and quantum random
access codes, which may be of independent interest. Lastly, with the assistance
of general Bloch-sphere representation, we show that learning quantum
measurements/states can be mathematically formulated as a neural network.

undirected graphs by Bj\""orklund [FOCS'10], and Bj\""orklund et al., [arXiv'10].
First, we demonstrate that the technique used can be generalized to finding
some $k$-vertex tree with $l$ leaves in an $n$-vertex undirected graph in
$O^*(1.657^k2^{l/2})$ time. It can be applied as a subroutine to solve the
$k$-Internal Spanning Tree ($k$-IST) problem in $O^*(\min(3.455^k, 1.946^n))$
time using polynomial space, improving upon previous algorithms for this
problem. In particular, for the first time we break the natural barrier of
$O^*(2^n)$. Second, we show that the iterated random bipartition employed by
the algorithm can be improved whenever the host graph admits a vertex coloring
with few colors; it can be an ordinary proper vertex coloring, a fractional
vertex coloring, or a vector coloring. In effect, we show improved bounds for
$k$-Path and Hamiltonicity in any graph of maximum degree $\Delta=4,\ldots,12$

shear are investigated in the non-Newtonian regime using non-equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulations. The shear viscosity, normal stress differences
and pressure of the bitumen mixture are computed at different shear rates and
different temperatures. The model bitumen is shown to be a shear-thinning fluid
at all temperatures. In addition, the Cooee model is able to reproduce
experimental results showing the formation of nanoaggregates composed of stacks
of flat aromatic molecules in bitumen. These nanoaggregates are immersed in a
solvent of saturated hydrocarbon molecules. At a fixed temperature, the
shear-shinning behavior is related to the inter- and intramolecular alignment
of the solvent molecules, but also to the decrease of the average size of the
nanoaggregates at high shear rates. The variation of the viscosity with
temperature at different shear rates is also related to the size and relative
composition of the nanoaggregates. The slight anisotropy of the whole sample
due to the nanoaggregates is considered and quantified. Finally, the position
of bitumen mixtures in the broad literature of complex systems such as
colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions and associating polymer networks is
discussed.

grows logarithmically in time right after the quench. After developing a
plateau-like feature, the entanglement negativity drops to the ground-state

be created. Our results agree with the heuristic picture that quasiparticles,

freely through the system. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical

C-membership problem asks for an algorithm to decide whether an input language
belongs to C. The C-separation problem asks for an algorithm that, given as
input two regular languages, decides whether there exists a third language in C
containing the first language, while being disjoint from the second. These
problems are considered as means to obtain a deep understanding of the class C.
  It is usual for such classes to be defined by logical formalisms. Logics are
often built on top of each other, by adding new predicates. A natural
construction is to enrich a logic with the successor relation. In this paper,
we obtain simple self-contained proofs of two transfer results: we show that
for suitable logically defined classes, the membership, resp. the separation
problem for a class enriched with the successor relation reduces to the same
problem for the original class.
  Our reductions work both for languages of finite words and infinite words.
The proofs are mostly self-contained, and only require a basic background on

double quantum dot detector, in which the qubit and double dot are arranged in
such a unique way that the detector turns out to be particularly susceptible to
the charge states of the qubit. Special attention is paid to the regime where
acquisition of qubit information and backaction upon the measured system
exhibit nontrivial correlation. The intrinsic dynamics of the qubit gives rise
to dynamical blockade of tunneling events through the detector, resulting in a
super-Poissonian noise. However, such a pronounced enhancement of detector's
shot noise does not necessarily produce a rising dephasing rate. In contrast,
an inhibition of dephasing is entailed by the reduction of information
acquisition in the dynamically blockaded regimes. We further reveal the
important impact of the charge fluctuations on the measurement characteristics.
Noticeably, under the condition of symmetric junction capacitances the noise
pedestal of circuit current is completely suppressed, leading to a divergent
signal-to-noise ratio, and eventually to a violation of the Korotkov-Averin
bound in quantum measurement. Our study offers the possibility for a double dot
detector to reach the quantum limited effectiveness in a transparent manner.

data.There are two unprecedented findings. One, from the average view a linear
law exists between the individual's travel distance with his original distance
to city center. The mechanism underlying is a travel pattern we called ""ring
aggregation"", i.e., the daily movement of city passengers is just aggregating
to a ring with roughly equal distance to city center.Interestingly, for the
round trips the daily travel pattern can be regarded as a switching between the
home ring at outer area with the office ring at the inner area. Second, this
linear law and ring aggregation pattern seems to be an exclusive characteristic
of the metro system. It can not be found in short distance transportation
modes, such as bicycle and taxi, neither as multiple transportation modes. This

and recursively continue the dividing process for the large ones (or the head)
until the notion of far more small things than large ones has been violated.
This paper attempts to argue that head/tail breaks can be a powerful
visualization tool for illustrating structure and dynamics of natural cities.
Natural cities refer to naturally or objectively defined human settlements
based on a meaningful cutoff averaged from a massive amount of units extracted
from geographic information. To illustrate the effectiveness of head/tail
breaks in visualization, I have developed several case studies applied to
natural cities derived from the points of interest, social media location data,
and time series nighttime images. I further elaborate on head/tail breaks
related to fractals, beauty, and big data.

Lax type integrable discretizations of one wide enough class of nonlinear
integrable dynamical systems on functional manifolds. Their Lie-algebraic
structure and complete integrability related with co-adjoint orbits on the
Markov co-algebras is discussed. It is shown that a set of conservation laws
and the associated Poisson structure ensue as a byproduct of the approach
devised. Based on the Lie algebras quasi-representation property the limiting
procedure of finding the nonlinear dynamical systems on the corresponding
functional spaces is demonstrated.

formation, and yet its nature is elusive to astrophysical probes. Information
on the nature and physical properties of the WIMP (neutralino) DM (the leading
candidate for a cosmologically relevant DM) can be obtained by studying the
astrophysical signals of their annihilation/decay. Among the various e.m.
signals, secondary electrons produced by neutralino annihilation generate
synchrotron emission in the magnetized atmosphere of galaxy clusters and
galaxies which could be observed as a diffuse radio emission (halo or haze)
centered on the DM halo. A deep search for DM radio emission with SKA in local
dwarf galaxies, galaxy regions with low star formation and galaxy clusters
(with offset DM-baryonic distribution, like e.g. the Bullet cluster) can be
very effective in constraining the neutralino mass, composition and
annihilation cross-section. For the case of a dwarf galaxy, like e.g. Draco,
the constraints on the DM annihilation cross-section obtainable with SKA1-MID
will be at least a factor $\sim 10^3$ more stringent than the limits obtained
by Fermi-LAT in the $\gamma$-rays. These limits scale with the value of the B
field, and the SKA will have the capability to determine simultaneously both
the magnetic field in the DM-dominated structures and the DM particle
properties. The optimal frequency band for detecting the DM-induced radio
emission is around $\sim 1$ GHz, with the SKA1-MID Band 1 and 4 important to
probe the synchrotron spectral curvature at low-$\nu$ (sensitive to DM
composition) and at high-$\nu$ (sensitive to DM mass).
