empirical model consisting of two Comptonization components, one for the low
energy soft excess and the other for the high energy power-law. A broad Iron
line and a couple of low energies edges are required to explain the spectra.
For Mrk~335, the 0.3 - 10 keV luminosity relative to the Eddington value,
L{$_{X}$}/L$_{Edd}$, varied from 0.002 to 0.06. The index variation can be
empirically described as $\Gamma$ = 0.6 log$_{10}$ L{$_{X}$}/L$_{Edd}$ + 3.0
for $0.005 < L{_{X}}/L_{Edd} < 0.04$. At $ L_{{X}}/L_{Edd} \sim 0.04$ the
spectral index changes and then continues to follow $\Gamma$ = 0.6 log$_{10}$
L$_{{X}}$/L$_{Edd}$ + 2.7, i.e. on a parallel track. We confirm that the result
is independent of the specific spectral model used by fitting the data in the 3

variation can be empirically described as $\Gamma$ = 0.2 log$_{10}$
L$_{{X}}$/L$_{Edd}$ + 2.7 with a significantly large scatter as compared to
Mrk~335. Our results indicate that for Mrk~335, there may be accretion disk
geometry changes which lead to different parallel tracks. These changes could
be related to structural changes in the corona or enhanced reflection at high
flux levels. There does not seem to be any homogeneous or universal

have been spent to improve tracking performance, a simple yet reliable prior
knowledge is left unexploited: the target object in tracking must be an object
other than non-object. The recently proposed and popularized objectness measure
provides a natural way to model such prior in visual tracking. Thus motivated,
in this paper we propose to adapt objectness for visual object tracking.
Instead of directly applying an existing objectness measure that is generic and
handles various objects and environments, we adapt it to be compatible to the
specific tracking sequence and object. More specifically, we use the newly
proposed BING objectness as the base, and then train an object-adaptive
objectness for each tracking task. The training is implemented by using an
adaptive support vector machine that integrates information from the specific
tracking target into the BING measure. We emphasize that the benefit of the
proposed adaptive objectness, named ADOBING, is generic. To show this, we
combine ADOBING with seven top performed trackers in recent evaluations. We run
the ADOBING-enhanced trackers with their base trackers on two popular
benchmarks, the CVPR2013 benchmark (50 sequences) and the Princeton Tracking
Benchmark (100 sequences). On both benchmarks, our methods not only
consistently improve the base trackers, but also achieve the best known
performances. Noting that the way we integrate objectness in visual tracking is
generic and straightforward, we expect even more improvement by using
tracker-specific objectness.

encounters between solar systems and passing cluster members, and calculates
the corresponding interaction cross sections. The target solar systems are
generally assumed to have four giant planets, with a variety of starting
states, including circular orbits with the semimajor axes of our planets, a
more compact configuration, an ultra-compact state with multiple mean motion
resonances, and systems with massive planets. We then consider the effects of
varying the cluster velocity dispersion, the relative importance of binaries
versus single stars, different stellar host masses, and finite starting
eccentricities of the planetary orbits. For each state of the initial system,
we perform an ensemble of numerical scattering experiments and determine the
cross sections for eccentricity increase, inclination angle increase, planet
ejection, and capture. This paper reports results from over 2 million
individual scattering simulations. Using supporting analytic considerations,
and fitting functions to the numerical results, we find a universal formula
that gives the cross sections as a function of stellar host mass, cluster
velocity dispersion, starting planetary orbital radius, and final eccentricity.
The resulting cross sections can be used in a wide variety of applications. As
one example, we revisit constraints on the birth aggregate of our Solar System
due to dynamical scattering and find $N<10^4$ (consistent with previous
estimates).

have provided a focus of recent research, the majority of the efforts
concentrating on the behaviour of the maximal subgroups. Inspired by an example
of Brittenham, Margolis and Meakin, several proofs have been offered that any
group occurs as a maximal subgroup of some IG$(E)$, the most recent being that
of Dolinka and Ru\v{s}kuc, who show that $E$ can be taken to be a band. From a
result of Easdown, Sapir and Volkov, periodic elements of any IG$(E)$ lie in
subgroups. However, little else is known of the `global' properties of IG$(E)$,
other than that it need not be regular, even where $E$ is a semilattice.
  Since its introduction by Fountain in the late 1970s, the study of abundant
and related semigroups has given rise to a deep and fruitful research area. The
classes of abundant and adequate semigroups extend those of regular and inverse
semigroups, respectively, and themselves are contained in the classes of weakly
abundant and weakly adequate semigroups. Recent significant developments
include the description by Kambites, using birooted labelled trees, of the free
semigroups in the quasi-variety of adequate semigroups.
  Our main result shows that for any band $B$, the semigroup IG$(B)$ is a
weakly abundant semigroup and moreover satisfies a natural condition called the
congruence condition. We show that if $B$ is a band for which $uv=vu=v$ for all
$u,v\in B$ with $BvB\subset BuB$ (a condition certainly satisfied for
semilattices), then IG$(B)$ is abundant with solvable word problem. Further,
IG$(B)$ is also abundant for a normal band $B$ for which IG$(B)$ satisfies a
given technical condition, and we give examples of such $B$. On the other hand,
we give an example of a normal band $B$ such that IG$(B)$ is not abundant.

significantly improve the efficiency of radio frequency (RF) signal enabled
wireless energy transfer (WET). To fully exploit the energy beamforming gain at
the energy transmitter (ET), the knowledge of channel state information (CSI)
is essential, which, however, is difficult to be obtained in practice due to
the hardware limitation of the energy receiver (ER). To overcome this
difficulty, under a point-to-point MIMO WET setup, this paper proposes a
general design framework for a new type of channel learning method based on the
ER's energy measurement and feedback. Specifically, the ER measures and encodes
the harvested energy levels over different training intervals into bits, and
sends them to the ET via a feedback link of limited rate. Based on the
energy-level feedback, the ET adjusts transmit beamforming in subsequent
training intervals and obtains refined estimates of the MIMO channel by
leveraging the technique of analytic center cutting plane method (ACCPM) in
convex optimization. Under this general design framework, we further propose
two specific feedback schemes termed energy quantization and energy comparison,
where the feedback bits at each interval are generated at the ER by quantizing
the measured energy level at the current interval and comparing it with those
in the previous intervals, respectively. Numerical results are provided to
compare the performance of the two feedback schemes. It is shown that energy
quantization performs better when the number of feedback bits per interval is
large, while energy comparison is more effective with small number of feedback
bits.

interstellar medium (ISM). We combine polarization data from Planck with
rotation measure (RM) observations towards a massive star-forming region, the
Rosette Nebula in the Monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic field
structure and the impact of an expanding HII region on the morphology of the
field. We derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed to
evolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion of
ionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ISM. From the RM data we
estimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field of
about 3microG (towards the observer) in the Rosette Nebula, for a uniform
electron density of about 12cm-3. The dust shell that surrounds the Rosette HII
region is clearly observed in the Planck intensity map at 353 GHz, with a
polarization signal significantly different from that of the local background
when considered as a whole. The Planck observations constrain the
plane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the Rosette's parent
molecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along the
Galactic plane. The Planck data are compared with the analytical model, which
predicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shell
for a given orientation of the field. This comparison leads to an upper limit
of about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field
in the Rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of
4%. This field direction can reproduce the RM values detected in the ionized
region if the magnetic field strength in the Monoceros molecular cloud is in
the range 6.5--9microG.

closures is essential to a fundamental understanding of nuclear structure. This
is especially true for those doubly magic nuclei that lie far from stability

around $^{100}$Sn is one of the most important due to the proximity of the
N=Z=50 magic numbers, the proton-drip line, and the end of the rp-process.
However, owing to the low production rates, there is a lack of spectroscopic

$^{108,106}$Sn and $^{106}$Cd have been performed at the NSCL. By measuring

The results also show a degree of mixing in the ground states of the isotopes
$^{108,106}$Sn between the d$_{5/2}$ and g$_{7/2}$ single particle-states and
they are compared to reaction calculations. Single-, double-, and
triple-neutron knockout reactions on the $^{106}$Cd beam have been observed.
The spin-parity of $^{105}$Cd is already known, therefore, the measurement of
the momentum distributions of the ground and first excited states of this

arises naturally in the design of low-power physical implementations of parity

is based on Arora's PTAS for rectilinear Steiner trees after lifting each
partition into an extra dimension. For the general case we propose an algorithm
that predetermines a connection point for each $T_i$ and $T_{top}$

  Then, we apply any approximation algorithm for minimum rectilinear Steiner
trees in the plane to compute each $T_i$ and $T_{top}$ independently.

thermal boundary conductance between two crystals, using molecular dynamics. We
show evidence of a transition between two regimes, depending on the interfacial
roughness: when the roughness is small, the boundary conductance is constant
taking values close to the conductance of the corresponding planar interface.
When the roughness is larger, the conductance becomes larger than the planar
interface conductance, and the relative increase is found to be close to the
increase of the interfacial area. The cross-plane conductivity of a
superlattice with rough interfaces is found to increase in a comparable amount,
suggesting that heat transport in superlattices is mainly controlled by the
boundary conductance. These observations are interpreted using the wave
characteristics of the energy carriers. We characterize also the effect of the
angle of the asperities, and find that the boundary conductance displayed by
interfaces having steep slopes may become important if the lateral period
characterizing the interfacial profile is large enough. Finally, we consider
the effect of the shape of the interfaces, and show that the sinusoidal
interface displays the highest conductance, because of its large true
interfacial area. All these considerations are relevant to the optimization of
nanoscale interfacial energy transport.

as an asymptotic model for the block maxima of a random variable and the
generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) as a model for the peak over thresholds
(POT) of the same random variable is presented more clearly. Pisarenko et al.
(2014) have inappropriately neglected that the approximations by GEVD and GPD
work only asymptotically in most cases. This applies particularly for the
truncated exponential distribution (TED), being a popular distribution model
for earthquake magnitudes. I explain why the classical models and methods of
the extreme value theory and statistics do not work well for truncated
exponential distributions. As a consequence, the classical methods should be
used for the estimation of the upper bound magnitude and corresponding
parameters. Furthermore, different issues of statistical inference of Pisarenko
et al. (2014) are commented on and alternatives are proposed. Arguments are
presented why GPD and GEVD would work for different types of stochastic
earthquake processes in time, and not only for the homogeneous (stationery)
Poisson process as assumed by Pisarenko et al. (2014). The crucial point of
earthquake magnitudes is the poor convergence of their tail distribution to the
GPD, and not the earthquake process in time.

time-dependent quantum particle, to a fluid system which is pseudo-barotropic,
irrotational and inviscid. We first discuss the hydrodynamical properties of
the Madelung description in general, and extract a pressure like term from the
Bohm potential. We show that the existence of a pressure gradient force in the
fluid description does not violate Ehrenfest's theorem since its expectation
value is zero. We also point out that incompressibility of the fluid implies
conservation of density along a fluid parcel trajectory and in 1D this
immediately results in the non-spreading property of wave packets, as the sum
of Bohm potential and an exterior potential must be either constant or linear
in space. Next we relate to the hydrodynamic description a thermodynamic
counterpart, taking the classical behavior of an adiabatic barotopric flow as a
reference. We show that while the Bohm potential is not a positive definite
quantity, as is expected from internal energy, its expectation value is
proportional to the Fisher information whose integrand is positive definite.
Moreover, this integrand is exactly equal to half of the square of the
imaginary part of the momentum, as the integrand of the kinetic energy is equal
to half of the square of the real part of the momentum. This suggests a
relation between the Fisher information and the thermodynamic like internal
energy of the Madelung fluid. Furthermore, it provides a physical linkage
between the inverse of the Fisher information and the measure of disorder in
quantum systems - in spontaneous adiabatic gas expansion the amount of disorder
increases while the internal energy decreases.

the ability to extract entropy from ancilla qubits. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) based quantum devices have demonstrated high control fidelity with up to
12 qubits. On the other hand, the major challenge in the NMR QEC experiment is
to efficiently supply ancilla qubits in highly pure states at the beginning of
each round of QEC. Purification of qubits in NMR, or in other ensemble based
quantum systems can be accomplished through Heat Bath Algorithmic Cooling
(HBAC). It is an efficient method for extracting entropy from qubits that
interact with a heat bath, allowing cooling below the bath temperature. For
practical HBAC, coupled electron-nuclear spin systems are more promising than
conventional NMR quantum processors, since electron spin polarization is about
$10^3$ times greater than that of a proton under the same experimental
conditions. We provide an overview on both theoretical and experimental aspects
of HBAC focusing on spin and magnetic resonance based systems, and discuss the
prospects of exploiting electron-nuclear coupled systems for the realization of

of the fiction data set and both unfiltered English data sets. Our findings
emphasize the need to fully characterize the dynamics of the Google Books
corpus before using these data sets to draw broad conclusions about cultural
and linguistic evolution.

  Mathematics Research Notices (IMRN)",,,,"math.DS math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a dynamical system, we say that a performance function has property P
if its time averages along orbits are maximized at a periodic orbit. It is
conjectured by several authors that for sufficiently hyperbolic dynamical
systems, property P should be typical among sufficiently regular performance
functions. In this paper we address this problem using a probabilistic notion
of typicality that is suitable to infinite dimension: the concept of prevalence
as introduced by Hunt, Sauer, and Yorke. For the one-sided shift on two
symbols, we prove that property P is prevalent in spaces of functions with a
strong modulus of regularity. Our proof uses Haar wavelets to approximate the
ergodic optimization problem by a finite-dimensional one, which can be
conveniently restated as a maximum cycle mean problem on a de Bruijin graph.

  extensible fibres","7 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci nlin.AO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spiders' webs and gossamer threads are often paraded as paradigms for
lightweight structures and outstanding polymers. Probably the most intriguing
of all spider silks is the araneid capture thread, covered with tiny
glycoprotein glue droplets. Even if compressed, this thread remains
surprisingly taut, a property shared with pure liquid films, allowing both
thread and web to be in a constant state of tension. Vollrath and Edmonds
proposed that the glue droplets would act as small windlasses and be
responsible for the tension, but other explanations have also been suggested,
involving for example the macromolecular properties of the flagelliform silk
core filaments. Here we show that the nanolitre glue droplets of the capture
thread indeed induce buckling and coiling of the core filaments: microscopic
in-vivo observations reveal that the slack fibre is spooled into and within the
droplets. We model windlass activation as a structural phase transition, and
show that fibre spooling essentially results from the interplay between
elasticity and capillarity. This is demonstrated by reproducing artificially
the mechanism on a synthetic polyurethane thread/silicone oil droplet system.
Fibre size is the key in natural and artificial setups which both require
micrometer-sized fibres to function. The spools and coils inside the drops are
further shown to directly affect the mechanical response of the thread,
evidencing the central role played by geometry in spider silk mechanics. Beside
shedding light on araneid capture thread functionality, we argue that the
properties of this biological system provide novel insights for bioinspired
synthetic actuators.

from 2008 to 2014 using the original SDSS wide-field imager, the original and
an upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infrared
high-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. All the data
from SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes Data
Release 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and Data
Release 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all data
included in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing.
Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new
spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples the
number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO)
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial
velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity
Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include measured
abundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added
2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the
Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey;
2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216
stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040
MARVELS spectra of 5,513 stars. Since its first light in 1998, SDSS has imaged
over 1/3 of the Celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five million
astronomical spectra.

Library Event Matching, developed in a different form by the earlier MINOS

a large library of simulated events to find those that best match the input
event. A key feature of the algorithm is that the comparisons are based on all
the information available in the event, as opposed to higher-level derived
quantities. The final event classifier is formed by examining the details of
the best-matched library events. We discuss the concept, definition,

Library Event Matching is well-suited to the monolithic, segmented detectors of

Temperature-dependent spin disorder, introduced within the vector disordered
local moment model, causes the valence band at the $\Gamma$ point to broaden
and shift upwards, crossing the Fermi level and thereby closing the
half-metallic gap above room temperature. The spectroscopic signatures of
excess Mn on the Ni, Sb, and empty sites (Mn$_\mathrm{Ni}$, Mn$_\mathrm{Sb}$,

invisible. The relatively weak coupling of Mn$_\mathrm{Sb}$ and Mn$_\mathrm{E}$
spins to the host strongly deviates from the Heisenberg model, and the spin of
Mn$_\mathrm{E}$ is canted in the ground state. While the half-metallic gap is
preserved in the collinear ground state of Mn$_\mathrm{Sb}$, thermal spin
disorder of the weakly coupled Mn$_\mathrm{Sb}$ spins destroys it at low
temperatures. This property of Mn$_\mathrm{Sb}$ may be the source of the
observed low-temperature transport anomalies.

of the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics by John Cramer. It is
kept deliberately mathematically simple to help explain the transactional
technique. The emphasis is on a clear understanding of how the instantaneous
""collapse"" of the wave function due to a measurement at a specific time and
place may be reinterpreted as a gradual collapse over the entire path of the
photon and over the entire transit time from slit to detector. This is made
possible by the use of a retarded offer wave, which is thought to travel from
the slits (or rather the small region within the parametric crystal where
down-conversion takes place) to the detector and an advanced counter wave
traveling backward in time from the detector to the slits. The point here is to
make clear how simple the Cramer transactional picture is and how much more
intuitive the collapse of the wave function becomes if viewed in this way. Also
any confusion about possible retro-causal signaling is put to rest. A delayed
choice quantum eraser does not require any sort of backward in time
communication. This paper makes the point that it is preferable to use the
Transactional Interpretation (TI) over the usual Copenhagen Interpretation (CI)
for a more intuitive understanding of the quantum eraser delayed choice
experiment. Both methods give exactly the same end results and can be used
interchangeably.

corresponding variants have been widely studied as efficient methods to
coordinate the medium access among competing users. But when two or more

collisions occur. When this happens, the received packets are discarded and
retransmissions are required, which is a waste of power and bandwidth. In such
a situation one of the most important objectives is to find techniques to
improve these protocols to reduce the number of collisions or to avoid them.
Several studies have contributed to this problem. In this paper, we propose a
new approach named ZigZag decoding to enhance slotted Aloha mechanism by
reducing the loss rate of packets colliding. We model the system by a Markov
chain witch the number of backlogged packets is taken as the system state. We
use a stochastic game to achieve our objective. We evaluate and compare the
performances parameters of the proposed approach with those of slotted Aloha
mechanism. All found results show that our approach is more efficient than the

$M(H_2)=10^{8.6}$-$10^{9.8} M_\odot$ and molecular gas mass to stellar mass
fractions of $\sim10^{-2}$-$10^{-0.5}$, comparable to those of star-forming
galaxies. The large amounts of molecular gas rule out complete gas consumption,
expulsion, or starvation as the primary mechanism that ends the starburst in
these galaxies. The upper limits on $M(H_2)$ for the 15 undetected galaxies
range from $10^{7.7} M_\odot$ to $10^{9.7} M_\odot$, with the median more
consistent with early-type galaxies than with star-forming galaxies. Upper
limits on the post-starburst star formation rates (SFRs) are lower by
$\sim10\times$ than for star-forming galaxies with the same $M(H_2)$. We also
compare the molecular gas surface densities ($\Sigma_{\rm H_2}$) to upper
limits on the SFR surface densities ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), finding a significant
offset, with lower $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ for a given $\Sigma_{\rm H_2}$ than is
typical for star-forming galaxies. This offset from the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation suggests that post-starbursts have lower star formation efficiency, a
low CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor characteristic of ULIRGs, and/or a
bottom-heavy initial mass function, although uncertainties in the rate and
distribution of current star formation remain.

propagation) occurs due to unintentional re-use of identical actions in the
for- mation of public belief in social learning; the information gathered by
each agent is mistakenly considered to be independent. This results in
overconfidence and bias in estimates of the state. Necessary and sufficient
conditions are given on the structure of information exchange graph to mitigate
data incest. Incest removal algorithms are presented. Experimental results on
human subjects are presented to illustrate the effect of social influence and
data incest on decision making. These experimental results indicate that social
learning protocols require careful design to handle and mitigate data incest.
The incest removal algorithms are illustrated in an expectation polling system

believed to result from the collapse and subsequent explosion of massive stars.
Even though it has profound consequences for our understanding of their nature
and selection biases, little is known about the dust properties of the galaxies
hosting GRBs. We present analysis of the far-infrared properties of an unbiased
sample of 20 \textit{BeppoSAX} and \textit{Swift} GRB host galaxies (at an
average redshift of $z\,=\,3.1$) located in the {\it Herschel} Astrophysical
Terahertz Large Area Survey, the {\it Herschel} Virgo Cluster Survey, the {\it
Herschel} Fornax Cluster Survey, the {\it Herschel} Stripe 82 Survey and the
{\it Herschel} Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey, totalling $880$ deg$^2$, or
$\sim 3$\% of the sky in total. Our sample selection is serendipitous, based
only on whether the X-ray position of a GRB lies within a large-scale {\it
Herschel} survey -- therefore our sample can be considered completely unbiased.
Using deep data at wavelengths of 100\,--\,500$\,\mu$m, we tentatively detected
1 out of 20 GRB hosts located in these fields. We constrain their dust masses
and star formation rates (SFRs), and discuss these in the context of recent
measurements of submillimetre galaxies and ultraluminous infrared galaxies. The
average far-infrared flux of our sample gives an upper limit on SFR of
$<114\,{\rm M}\odot\,\mbox{yr}^{-1}$. The detection rate of GRB hosts is
consistent with that predicted assuming that GRBs trace the cosmic SFR density
in an unbiased way, i.e. that the fraction of GRB hosts with
$\mbox{SFR}>500\,{\rm M}\odot\,\mbox{yr}^{-1}$ is consistent with the
contribution of such luminous galaxies to the cosmic star formation density.

domain $(t,s)$. Time-harmonic phasors are replaced by the positive-frequency
parts of general fields, which extend analytically to complex time $t+is$, with
$s>0$ interpreted as a time resolution scale. The real part of the extended CPT
gives conservation in $t$ of a time-averaged field energy, and its imaginary
part gives conservation in $s$ of a time-averaged reactive energy. In both
cases, the averaging windows are determined by a Cauchy kernel of width $\Delta
t\sim \pm s$. This completes the time-harmonic CPT, whose imaginary part is
generally supposed to be vaguely `related to' reactive energy without giving a
conservation law, or even an expression, for the latter. The interpretation of
$s$ as reactive time, tracking the leads and lags associated with stored
capacitative and inductive energy, gives a simple explanation of the
volt-ampere reactive (var) unit measuring reactive power: a var is simply one
Joule per reactive second. The related 'complex radiation impedance density' is
introduced to represent the field's local reluctance to radiate.

molecular gas appears to be heated by jet-driven shocks, but exactly how this

emission from the jets within the host galaxy and along the 100 kpc radio jets.
We model the X-ray spectra of the nucleus, the inner jets, and the X-ray
features along the extended radio jets. Both the nucleus and the inner jets
show evidence of 10^7 K shock-heated gas. The kinetic power of the jets is more
than sufficient to heat the X-ray emitting gas within the host galaxy. The
thermal X-ray and warm H2 luminosities of 3C293 are similar, indicating similar
masses of X-ray hot gas and warm molecular gas. This is consistent with a
picture where both derive from a multiphase, shocked interstellar medium (ISM).
We find that radio-loud MOHEGs that are not brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs),
like 3C293, typically have LH2/LX~1 and MH2/MX~1, whereas MOHEGs that are BCGs
have LH2/LX~0.01 and MH2/MX~0.01. The more massive, virialized, hot atmosphere

emergence of a weak saw-tooth structure in magnetization in the high anisotropy

exponentially fast relaxation, the last stages of thermalization are governed

screens important interactions by examining only $p$ features instead of all

that q-Gaussian and q-exponential random variables can always be expressed as

that are, initially, distributed uniformly in space and dynamically cool
(virial ratios $Q=2T/|\Omega|$ below ~0.3). In this work, we study the mass
segregation that emerges after the initial violent dynamical evolution. At this
scope, we ran a set of high precision N-body simulations of isolated clusters
by means of HiGPUs, our direct summation N-body code. After the collapse, the
system shows a clear mass segregation. This (quick) mass segregation occurs in
two phases: the first shows up in clumps originated by sub-fragmentation before
the deep overall collapse; this segregation is partly erased during the deep
collapse to re-emerge, abruptly, during the second phase, that follows the
first bounce of the system. In this second stage, the proper clock to measure
the rate of segregation is the dynamical time after virialization, which (for
cold and cool systems) may be significantly different from the crossing time
evaluated from initial conditions. This result is obtained for isolated
clusters composed of stars of two different masses (in the ratio $m_h/m_l=2$),
at varying their number ratio, and is confirmed also in presence of a massive
central object (simulating a black hole of stellar size). Actually, in stellar
systems starting their dynamical evolution from cool conditions, the fast mass
segregation adds to the following, slow, secular segregation which is
collisionally induced. The violent mass segregation is an effect persistent
over the whole range of N ($128 \leq N \leq 1024$) investigated, and is an
interesting feature on the astronomical-observational side, too. The
semi-steady state reached after virialization corresponds to a mass segregated
distribution function rather than that of equipartition of kinetic energy per
unit mass as it should result from violent relaxation.

analytically and numerically, and exact results are known for large T (Brownian
motion limit), little is known about the full distributions P(A) and P(L). In
this paper, we provide numerical results for these distributions. We use a
sophisticated large-deviation approach that allows us to study the
distributions over a larger range of the support, where the probabilities P(A)
and P(L) are as small as 10^{-300}. We analyze (open) random walks as well as
(closed) Brownian bridges on the two-dimensional discrete grid as well as in
the two-dimensional plane. The resulting distributions exhibit, for large T, a
universal scaling behavior (independent of the details of the jump
distributions) as a function of A/T and L/\sqrt{T}, respectively. We are also
able to obtain the rate function, describing rare events at the tails of these
distributions, via a numerical extrapolation scheme and find a linear and
square dependence as a function of the rescaled perimeter and the rescaled
area, respectively.

VLBA. We detect the X-band downlink signal from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and
Odyssey with the VLBA and transmit the data over the internet for correlation
at the VLBA correlator in near real-time. Quasars near Mars in the plane of the
sky are used as position references. In the demonstration we were able to
obtain initial position measurements within about 15 minutes of the start of
the observation. The measured positions differ from the projected ephemerides
by a few milliarcseconds, and the repeatability of the measurement is better
than 0.3 milliarcseconds as determined from measurements from multiple scans.
We demonstrate that robust and repeatable offsets are obtained even when
removing half of the antennas. These observations demonstrate the feasibility
of astrometry with the VLBA with a low latency and sub-milliarcsecond
repeatability.

multi-site coarse-grained (CG) models as applied to macromolecular solutions in
the dilute and semi-dilute regime. We first consider single-site models with
zero-density and density-dependent pair potentials. We highlight advantages and
limitations of each option in reproducing the thermodynamic behavior and the
large-scale structure of the underlying reference model. As a case study we
consider solutions of linear homopolymers in a solvent of variable quality.
Secondly, we extend the discussion to multi-component systems presenting, as a
test case, results for mixtures of colloids and polymers. Specifically, we
found the CG model with zero-density potentials to be unable to predict
fluid-fluid demixing in a reasonable range of densities for mixtures of
colloids and polymers of equal size. For larger colloids, the polymer volume
fractions at which phase separation occurs are largely overestimated. CG models
with density-dependent potentials are somewhat less accurate than models with
zero-density potentials in reproducing the thermodynamics of the system and,
although they presents a phase separation, they significantly underestimate the
polymer volume fractions along the binodal. Finally, we discuss a general
multi-site strategy, which is thermodynamically consistent and fully
transferable with the number of sites, and that allows us to overcome most of
the limitations discussed for single-site models.

galactic evolution. Differences in the colours, morphologies, star formation
rates and gas fractions amongst galaxies of equal stellar/baryon mass M are
potentially widely explained by variations in their specific stellar/baryon
angular momentum j. The enormous potential of angular momentum science is only
just being realised, thanks to the emergence of the first simulations of
galaxies with converged spins, paralleled by a dramatic increase in kinematic
observations. Such observations are still challenged by the fact that most of
the stellar/baryon angular momentum resides at large radii. In fact, the radius
that maximally contributes to the angular momentum of an exponential disk
(3Re-4Re) is twice as large as the radius that maximally contributes to the
disk mass; thus converged measurements of angular momentum require either
extremely deep IFS data or, alternatively, kinematic measurements of neutral
atomic hydrogen (HI), which naturally resides at the large disk radii that
dominate the angular momentum. The SKA has a unique opportunity to become the
world-leading facility for angular momentum studies due to its ability to
measure the resolved and/or global HI kinematics in very large and
well-characterised galaxy samples. These measurements will allow, for example,
(1) a very robust determination of the two-dimensional distribution of galaxies
in the (M,j)-plane, (2) the largest, systematic measurement of the relationship
between M, j, and tertiary galaxy properties, and (3) the most accurate
measurement of the large-scale distribution and environmental dependence of
angular momentum vectors, both in terms of norm and orientation. All these
measurements will represent exquisite tools to build a next generation of
galaxy evolution models.

magnetars. Such Poynting flux could become lepton-dominated so that a reverse

accounting for the optical transient PTF11agg (Wang & Dai 2013b). In this paper
we investigate the X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) radiation as well as the optical

important because it has the right energy to ionize the hot ejecta at times
$t\lesssim 600$ s. It is thought that the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers
are a remarkably pure sample of r-process material, about which our
understanding is still incomplete. In this paper we evaluate the possibility of
observationally determining the bound-bound and bound-free opacities of the

space-based telescopic survey operating at thermal infrared wavelengths that
seeks to discover and characterize a large fraction of the potentially
hazardous near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population. Two potential architectures for
the survey were considered: one located at the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrange point, and
one in a Venus-trailing orbit. A sample cadence was formulated and tested,
allowing for the self-follow-up necessary for objects discovered in the daytime
sky on Earth. Synthetic populations of NEAs with sizes >=140 m in effective
spherical diameter were simulated using recent determinations of their physical
and orbital properties. Estimates of the instrumental sensitivity, integration
times, and slew speeds were included for both architectures assuming the
properties of new large-format 10 um detector arrays capable of operating at
~35 K. Our simulation included the creation of a preliminary version of a
moving object processing pipeline suitable for operating on the trial cadence.
We tested this pipeline on a simulated sky populated with astrophysical sources
such as stars and galaxies extrapolated from Spitzer and WISE data, the catalog
of known minor planets (including Main Belt asteroids, comets, Jovian Trojans,
etc.), and the synthetic NEA model. Trial orbits were computed for simulated
position-time pairs extracted from the synthetic surveys to verify that the
tested cadence would result in orbits suitable for recovering objects at a
later time. Our results indicate that the Earth-Sun L1 and Venus-trailing
surveys achieve similar levels of integral completeness for potentially
hazardous asteroids larger than 140 m; placing the telescope in an interior
orbit does not yield an improvement in discovery rates. This work serves as a
necessary first step for the detailed planning of a next-generation NEA survey.

thought to have been resource intensive to create in the first place ---
typically requiring either very strong nonlinearities, or nondeterministic
preparation schemes with feed-forward, which are difficult to implement. Very
recently, arising from the study of quantum random walks with multi-photon

optical interferometers fed with single-photon inputs, it has been shown that
such passive linear optical devices generate a superexponentially large amount
of number-path entanglement. A logical question to ask is whether this

here in the affirmative by showing that a simple, passive, linear-optical

with simple, single-mode, disjoint photodetection --- is capable of
significantly beating the shotnoise limit. Our result implies a pathway forward
to practical quantum metrology with readily available technology.

considering the cold field electron emission properties of rough Large-Area
Conducting Field Emitter Surfaces (LACFESs). A LACFES is represented by a
self-affine Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function in a given spatial direction. For
$0.1 \leqslant H < 0.5$, the local electric field distribution exhibits two
clear exponential regimes. Moreover, a scaling between the macroscopic current
density ($J_M$) and the characteristic kernel current density ($J_{kC}$),
$J_{M} \sim [J_{kC}]^{\beta_{H}}$, with an H-dependent exponent $\beta_{H} >
1$, has been found. This feature, which is less pronounced (but not absent) in
the range where more smooth surfaces have been found ($0.5 \leqslant H
\leqslant 0.9$), is a consequence of the dependency between the area efficiency
of emission of a LACFES and the macroscopic electric field, which is often
neglected in the interpretation of cold field electron emission experiments.
Considering the recent developments in orthodox field emission theory, we show
that the exponent $\beta_{H}$ must be considered when calculating the slope
characterization parameter (SCP) and thus provides a relevant method of more
precisely extracting the characteristic field enhancement factor from the slope
of the FN plot.

turbulence of the hot gas in clusters by estimating the velocity widths of
their X-ray emission lines. The RGS Spectrometers aboard XMM-Newton are
currently the only instruments provided with sufficient effective area and
spectral resolution in this energy domain. We benefited from excellent 1.6Ms
new data provided by the CHEERS project. The new observations improve the
quality of the archival data and allow us to place constraints for some
clusters, which were not accessible in previous work. One-half of the sample
shows upper limits on turbulence less than 500km/s. For several sources, our
data are consistent with relatively strong turbulence with upper limits on the
velocity widths that are larger than 1000km/s. The NGC507 group of galaxies
shows transonic velocities, which are most likely associated with the merging
phenomena and bulk motions occurring in this object. Where both low- and
high-ionization emission lines have good enough statistics, we find larger
upper limits for the hot gas, which is partly due to the different spatial
extents of the hot and cool gas phases. Our upper limits are larger than the
Mach numbers required to balance cooling, suggesting that dissipation of
turbulence may prevent cooling, although other heating processes could be
dominant. The systematics associated with the spatial profile of the source
continuum make this technique very challenging, though still powerful, for
current instruments. The ASTRO-H and Athena missions will revolutionize the
velocity estimates and discriminate between different spatial regions and

photospheric and chromospheric halo enhancement is due to the creation and
subsequent reflection of magnetically dominated fast waves from essentially
acoustic waves as they cross $a=c$. In simulations where we have capped $a$
such that waves are not permitted to refract after reaching the $a=c$ height,

(IGM), is an important aspect of galaxy formation. One of the most fundamental,
but unanswered questions in the evolution of galaxies is how gas circulates in
and around galaxies and how it enters the galaxies to support star formation.
We have several lines of evidence that the observed evolution of star formation
requires gas accretion from the IGM at all times and on all cosmic scales. This
gas remains largely unaccounted for and the outstanding questions are where
this gas resides and what the physical mechanisms of accretion are. The gas is
expected to be embedded in an extended cosmic web made of sheets and filaments.
Such large-scale filaments of gas are expected by cosmological numerical
simulations, which have made significant progress in recent years. Such
simulations do not only model the large scale structure of the cosmic web, but
also investigate the neutral gas component. To truly make significant progress
in understanding the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the IGM, column
densities of NHI=10^18 cm-2 and below have to be probed over large areas on the
sky at sub-arcminute resolution. These are the densities of the faintest
structures known today around nearby galaxies, though mostly found with single
dish telescopes which do not have the resolution to resolve these structures
and investigate any kinematics. Existing interferometers lack the collecting
power or short baselines to achieve brightness sensitivities typically below
NHI=10^19 cm-2. Reaching lower column densities with current facilities is
feasible, however requires prohibitively long observing times. The SKA will for
the first time break these barriers, enabling interferometric observations an
order of magnitude deeper than current interferometers and with an order of
magnitude better linear resolution than single-dish telescopes.

($M_\ast$) is re-examined using a mass-selected sample of $\sim$62,000
star-forming galaxies at $z \le 1.3$ in the COSMOS 2-deg$^2$ field. Using new
far-infrared photometry from $Herschel$-PACS and SPIRE and $Spitzer$-MIPS 24
$\mu$m, along with derived infrared luminosities from the NRK method based on
galaxies' locations in the restframe color-color diagram $(NUV - r)$ vs. $(r -
K)$, we are able to more accurately determine total SFRs for our complete
sample. At all redshifts, the relationship between median $SFR$ and $M_\ast$
follows a power-law at low stellar masses, and flattens to nearly constant SFR
at high stellar masses. We describe a new parameterization that provides the
best fit to the main sequence and characterizes the low mass power-law slope,
turnover mass, and overall scaling. The turnover in the main sequence occurs at
a characteristic mass of about $M_{0} \sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ at all redshifts.
The low mass power-law slope ranges from 0.9-1.3 and the overall scaling rises
in SFR as a function of $(1+z)^{4.12 \pm 0.10}$. A broken power-law fit below
and above the turnover mass gives relationships of $SFR \propto M_{*}^{0.88 \pm
0.06}$ below the turnover mass and $SFR \propto M_{*}^{0.27 \pm 0.04}$ above
the turnover mass. Galaxies more massive than $M_\ast \gtrsim 10^{10}\ M_{\rm

have vast reservoirs of cool (~10,000 K) and cold (~100 K) gas. In many low
redshift brightest group and cluster galaxies this gas is lifted into the hot
ISM in filamentary structures, which are long lived and are typically not
forming stars. Two important questions are how far do these reservoirs cool and
if cold gas is abundant what is the cause of the low star formation efficiency?
Heating and excitation of the filaments from collisions and mixing of hot
particles in the surrounding X-ray gas describes well the optical and near
infra-red line ratios observed in the filaments. In this paper we examine the
theoretical properties of dense, cold clouds emitting in the far infra-red and
submillimeter through the bright lines of [C II]157 \mu m , [O I]63 \mu m and
CO, exposed to these energetic ionising particles. While some emission lines
may be optically thick we find this is not sufficient to model the emission
line ratios. Models where the filaments are supported by thermal pressure
support alone also cannot account for the cold gas line ratios but a very
modest additional pressure support, either from turbulence or magnetic fields
can fit the observed [O I]/[C II] line ratios by decreasing the density of the
gas. This may also help stabilise the filaments against collapse leading to the
low rates of star formation. Finally we make predictions for the line ratios
expected from cold gas under these conditions and present diagnostic diagrams
for comparison with further observations. We provide our code as an Appendix.

the combination of HI data with that at other wavelengths. These
multiwavelength datasets will enable studies to move beyond an understanding of
HI gas in isolation to instead understand HI as an integral part of the highly
complex baryonic processes that drive galaxy evolution.
  As they evolve, galaxies experience a host of environmental and feedback
influences, many of which can radically impact their gas content. Important
processes include: accretion (hot and cold mode, mergers), depletion (star
formation, galactic winds, AGN), phase changes (ionised/atomic/molecular), and
environmental effects (ram pressure stripping, tidal effects, strangulation).
Governing all of these to various extents is the underlying dark matter
distribution. In turn, the result of these processes can significantly alter
the baryonic states in which material is finally observed (stellar populations,
dust, chemistry) and its morphology (galaxy type, bulge/disk ratio, bars,
warps, radial profile). To fully understand the evolution of HI and the role it
plays in galactic evolution requires the ability to quantify each of these
separate processes, and hence to coordinate SKA HI surveys with extensive
multi-band photometric and spectroscopic campaigns. In addition,
multiwavelength data is essential for statistical methods of HI analysis such
as HI stacking and intensity mapping cross-correlations.
  In this chapter, we examine some of the principal science motivations for
acquiring multiwavelength data to match that from the extragalactic SKA HI
surveys, and review the currently planned capacity to achieve this (eg. LSST,
Euclid, W-FIRST, SPICA, ALMA, and 4MOST).

considered in the literature, where a sink node wants to compute a target
function with the inputs generated at multiple source nodes. The network links
are error-free but capacity-limited, and the intermediate network nodes perform
network coding. The target function is required to be computed with zero error.
The computing rate of a network code is measured by the average number of times
that the target function can be computed for one use of the network, i.e., each
link in the network is used at most once. In the papers [1], [2], two cut-set
bounds were proposed on the computing rate. However, we show in this paper that
these bounds are not valid for general network function computation problems.
We analyze the arguments that lead to the invalidity of these bounds and fix
the issue with a new cut-set bound, where a new equivalence relation associated
with the inputs of the target function is used. Our bound is qualified for
general target functions and network topologies. We also show that our bound is
tight for some special cases where the computing capacity is known. Moreover,
some results in [11], [12] were proved using the invalid upper bound in [1] and
hence their correctness needs further justification. We also justify their
validity in the paper.

the probability of identity-by-descent between pairs of genes according to the
geographic distance between them. Well established analytical results indicate
that the relationship between geographical and genetic distance depends mostly
on the neighborhood size of the population, $N_b = 4{\pi}{\sigma}^2 D_e$, which
represents a standardized measure of dispersal. To test this prediction, we
model local dispersal of haploid individuals on a two-dimensional torus using
four dispersal kernels: Rayleigh, exponential, half-normal and triangular. When
neighborhood size is held constant, the distributions produce similar patterns
of isolation-by-distance, confirming predictions. Considering this, we propose
that the triangular distribution is the appropriate null distribution for
isolation-by-distance studies. Under the triangular distribution, dispersal is
uniform within an area of $4{\pi}{\sigma}^2$ (i.e. the neighborhood area),
which suggests that the common description of neighborhood size as a measure of
a local panmictic population is valid for popular families of dispersal
distributions. We further show how to draw from the triangular distribution
efficiently and argue that it should be utilized in other studies in which
computational efficiency is important

analyzing and combining the fluorescence intermittency images emanating from

investigated with high fidelity and remarkably enhanced contrast at
sub-diffraction resolution. The spectral separation also significantly
decreased the frame number required for SOFI, enabling fast super-resolution

can decrease the labeling density in each spectral channel, we can faithfully
reflect the continuous microtubule structure with high resolution through
collection of only 100 frames per channel. The improved continuity of the

large paramagnetic component has been induced and scales up with defect
concentration, which can be well accounted for by uncoupled divacancies.
However, the ferromagnetic contribution is still weak and only appears in the
low fluence range of neutrons or after annealing treatments. First-principles
calculations hint towards a mutually exclusive role of the concentration of
defects: Defects favor spin polarization at the expense of magnetic
interaction. Combining both experimental and first-principles calculation
results, the defect-induced ferromagnetism can be understood as a local effect
which cannot be scaled up with the volume. Therefore, our investigation answers

Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is studied. This subject is an open
problem in signal processing for more than 50 years. Local methods suggested in
recent years, have obtained better results than global methods. However by more
intelligent training in such a way that first, important data is more effective
for training, second, clustering in such way that training blocks lie in
low-rank subspaces, we can design a dictionary applicable for image de-noising
and obtain results near the state of the art local methods. In the present
paper, we suggest a method based on global clustering of image constructing
blocks. As the type of clustering plays an important role in clustering-based
de-noising methods, we address two questions about the clustering. The first,
which parts of the data should be considered for clustering? and the second,
what data clustering method is suitable for de-noising.? Then clustering is
exploited to learn an over complete dictionary. By obtaining sparse
decomposition of the noisy image blocks in terms of the dictionary atoms, the
de-noised version is achieved. In addition to our framework, 7 popular
dictionary learning methods are simulated and compared. The results are
compared based on two major factors: (1) de-noising performance and (2)
execution time. Experimental results show that our dictionary learning
framework outperforms its competitors in terms of both factors.

find a wide range of morphological diversities for sBzKs, from diffuse to

from the observed cosmic star formation rate. This allows to estimate the rate

ad LIGO and to compare those rates with independent predictions. In this
context, the rapid neutron capture process, or r process, can be used as a
constraint assuming NSM is the main astrophysical site for this nucleosynthetic
process. We compute the early cosmic evolution of a typical r process element,
Europium. Eu yields from NSM are taken from recent nucleosynthesis
calculations. The same approach allows to compute the cosmic rate of Core
Collapse SuperNovae (CCSN) and the associated evolution of Eu. We find that the
bulk of Eu observations at high iron abundance can be rather well fitted by
either CCSN or NSM scenarios. However, at lower metallicity, the early Eu
cosmic evolution favors NSM as the main astrophysical site for the r process. A
comparison between our calculations and spectroscopic observations at very low
metallicities allows to constrain the coalescence timescale in the NSM scenario
to about 0.1 to 0.2 Gyr. These values are in agreement with the coalescence
timescales of some observed binary pulsars. Finally, the cosmic evolution of Eu
is used to put constraints on the NSM rate, the merger rate in the horizon of

expected rate of electromagnetic counterparts to mergers (kilonovae) in large

The obtained upper and lower bounds of the approximation error as well as of

the smoothness properties of the infinite-variate parametric or stochastic part

7.1 keV were detected in the source spectrum. An absorption like feature at ~39
keV was detected in the residuals while fitting the data with NPEX model.
Considering the feature as cyclotron absorption line, the surface magnetic
field of the neutron star was estimated to be ~3.4 times 10^12 Gauss. To
understand the cause of rapid variation in the source flux, time-resolved
spectroscopy was carried out by dividing the observation into 20 narrow
segments. The results obtained from the time-resolved spectroscopy are
interpreted as the accretion of inhomogeneously distributed matter in the
stellar wind of the supergiant companion star as the cause of observed flux
variation in 4U 1700-37. A sharp increase in column density after ~0.63 orbital
phase indicates the presence of an accretion wake that blocks the continuum and
produces the eclipse like low-flux segment.

chromodynamics under extreme conditions of temperature and density have been
analysed. To this end, we use SU(3) Polyakov linear sigma-model and assume that
the external magnetic field eB adds some restrictions to the quarks energy due
to the existence of free charges in the plasma phase. In doing this, we apply
the Landau theory of quantization. This requires an additional temperature to
drive the system through the chiral phase-transition. Accordingly, the
dependence of the critical temperature of chiral and confinement
phase-transitions on the magnetic field is characterized. Based on this, we
have studied the thermal evolution of thermodynamic quantities and the first
four higher-order moment of particle multiplicity. Having all these
calculations, we have studied the effects of magnetic field on chiral
phase-transition. We found that both critical temperature T_c and critical
chemical potential increase with increasing the magnetic field eB. Last but not
least, the magnetic effects of the thermal evolution of four scalar and four
pseudoscalar meson states are studied. We concluded that the meson masses
decrease as the temperature increases till T_c. Then, the vacuum effect becomes
dominant and rapidly increases with the temperature T. At low T, the scalar
meson masses normalized to the lowest Matsubara frequency rapidly decreases as
T increases. Then, starting from T_c, we find that the thermal dependence
almost vanishes. Furthermore, the meson masses increase with increasing
magnetic field. This gives characteristic phase diagram of T vs. external
magnetic field $B. At high T, we find that the masses of almost all meson
states become temperature independent. It is concluded that the various meson
states likely have different T_c's.

continuity of the mass density at the surface of the torus. The density
perturbation and ellipticity of such a star are calculated in general and for

telescopes allow the detection of an increasing number of isotopically
substituted molecules in the interstellar medium. The 14N/ 15N ratio is
difficult to measure directly for carbon containing molecules. Aims. We want to
check the underlying hypothesis that the 13C/ 12C ratio of nitriles and
isonitriles is equal to the elemental value via a chemical time dependent gas
phase chemical model. Methods. We have built a chemical network containing D,
13C and 15N molecular species after a careful check of the possible
fractionation reactions at work in the gas phase. Results. Model results
obtained for 2 different physical conditions corresponding respectively to a
moderately dense cloud in an early evolutionary stage and a dense depleted
pre-stellar core tend to show that ammonia and its singly deuterated form are
somewhat enriched in 15N, in agreement with observations. The 14N/ 15N ratio in
N2H+ is found to be close to the elemental value, in contrast to previous
models which obtain a significant enrichment, as we found that the
fractionation reaction between 15N and N2H+ has a barrier in the entrance
channel. The large values of the N2H+/15NNH+ and N2H+/ N15NH+ ratios derived in
L1544 cannot be reproduced in our model. Finally we find that nitriles and
isonitriles are in fact significantly depleted in 13C, questioning previous
interpretations of observed C15N, HC15N and H15NC abundances from 13C
containing isotopologues.

whose intersection is $P$. There are efficient algorithms to test if a partial

to test if a partial order has dimension $\leq k$ is NP-complete. The height of

schemes. The Goodenough model, i.e. an ordered state comprising strong nearest
neighbor ferromagnetic interactions along zig-zag chains with antiferromagnetic
inter-chain coupling, provides the best description of the data, provided that
further neighbor interactions along the chains are included. We are able to
rule out a coupling scheme involving formation of strongly bound ferromagnetic
dimers, i.e. Zener polarons, on the basis of gross features of the observed
spin wave spectrum. A model with weaker dimerization reproduces the observed
dispersion but can be ruled out on the basis of discrepancies between the
calculated and observed structure factors at certain positions in reciprocal
space. Adding further neighbor interactions results in almost no dimerization,
i.e. recovery of the Goodenough model. These results are consistent with
theoretical analysis of the degenerate double exchange model for half-doping,
and provide a recipe for how to interpret future measurements away from
half-doping, where degenerate double exchange models predict more complex

the Stokes spectra, allowing the retrieval of gradients in optical depth within
the atmosphere of each pixel, whilst accounting for the effects of the
instrument's PSF. Consequently, no magnetic filling factor was needed. The
inversion results reveal that plage is composed of magnetic flux concentrations
(MFCs) with typical field strengths of 1520 G at log(\tau)=-0.9 and
inclinations of 10-15 degrees. The MFCs expand by forming magnetic canopies
composed of weaker and more inclined magnetic fields. The expansion and average
temperature stratification of isolated MFCs can be approximated well with an
empirical plage thin flux-tube model. The highest temperatures of MFCs are
located at their edges in all log(\tau) layers. Whilst the plasma inside MFCs
is nearly at rest, each is surrounded by a ring of downflows of on average 2.4
km/s at log(\tau)=0 and peak velocities of up to 10 km/s, which are supersonic.
The downflow ring of an MFC weakens and shifts outwards with height, tracing
the MFC's expansion. Such downflow rings often harbour magnetic patches of
opposite polarity to that of the main MFC with typical field strengths below
300 G at log(\tau)=0. These opposite polarity patches are situated beneath the
canopy of their main MFC. We found evidence of a strong broadening of the
Stokes profiles in MFCs and particularly in the downflow rings surrounding MFCs
(expressed by a microturbulence in the inversion). This indicates the presence
of strong unresolved velocities. Larger magnetic structures such as sunspots
cause the field of nearby MFCs to be more inclined.

comparison of the values of the critical temperatures for QGP-hadron phase
transition with those obtained for the deconfinement-phase transition, has been
shown to lead to the relaxation of the system via a mixed phase of QGP and hot

August, and two Chandra observations taken in 2001 September and 2004 June. We
found only marginal hints of a limited number of dips in the light curve,
previously reported to occur in this source, although the uncertainties due to
the low counting statistics of the data are large. The Chandra and Swift
spectra showed clearly spectral variability which resembles those observed in
other ULXs. We can account for this spectral variability in terms of changes in
both the normalization and intrinsic column density of a two-components model
consisting of a blackbody (for the soft component) and a multicolour accretion
disc (for the hard component). We discuss the possibility that strong outflows
ejected by the disc are in part responsible for such spectral changes.

electron-glasses to gain information on the fundamental nature of the
interacting Anderson-localized phase. The methodology is based on measuring the
energy absorbed by the electronic system from alternating electromagnetic
fields as function of their frequency. Experiments on three-dimensional (3D)
amorphous indium-oxide films suggest that, in the strongly localized regime,
the energy spectrum is discrete and inelastic electron-electron events are
strongly suppressed. These results imply that, at low temperatures, electron
thermalization and finite conductivity depend on coupling to the phonon bath.
The situation is different for samples nearing the metal-insulator transition;
in insulating samples that are close to the mobility-edge, energy absorption
persists to much higher frequencies. Comparing these results with previously
studied 2D samples [Ovadyahu, Phys. Rev. Lett., 108, 156602 (2012)]
demonstrates that the mean-level spacing (on a single-particle basis) is not
the only relevant scale in this problem. The possibility of de-localization by
many-body effects and the relevance of a nearby mobility-edge (which may be a
many-body edge) are discussed.

lightly-doped semiconductors, is observable in GeSbTe compounds using infrared
excitation at cryogenic temperatures. The low level of energy-flux necessary to
induce an appreciable effect seems surprising given the high
carrier-concentration n of these ternary alloys. On the other hand, their high
density of carriers makes GeSbTe films favorable candidates for exhibiting
intrinsic electron-glass effects with long relaxation times. These are indeed
observed in GeSbTe thin-films that are Anderson-localized. In particular, a
memory-dip is observed in samples with sheet resistances larger than app. 100
kOhms at T=4K with similar characteristics as in other systems that exhibit
intrinsic electron-glass effects. Persistent-photoconductivity however is
observable in GeSbTe films even for sheet resistances of the order of 1 kOhm,
well below the range of disorder required for observing electron-glass effects.
These two non-equilibrium phenomena, PPC and electron-glass, are shown to be of
different nature in terms of other aspects as well. In particular, their
relaxation dynamics is qualitatively different; the excess conductance dG/G
associated with PPC decays with time as a stretched exponential whereas a
logarithmic relaxation law characterizes dG(t) of all electron-glasses studied
to date. Surprisingly, the magnitude of the memory-dip is enhanced when the
system is in the PPC state. This counter-intuitive result may be related to the
compositional disorder in these materials extending over mesoscopic scales.
Evidence in support of this scenario is presented and discussed.

large $\tilde{\Gamma}_1=\Gamma(2\,{}^3P_1\rightarrow J/\psi\gamma)=85.4$~keV

$\tilde{R_{\psi\gamma}}=\frac{\tilde{\Gamma}_2}{\tilde{\Gamma}_1}=0.84$. In the

$X(3872)$ due to the CC effects. Its weight $c_{\rm X}(E_{\rm R})=0.200\pm
0.015$ is calculated. Secondly, the use of the multipole function $g(r)$
instead of $r$ in the overlap integrals, determining the partial widths.
Thirdly, the choice of the gluon-exchange interaction for $X(3872)$, as well as
for other states above threshold. If for $X(3872)$ the gluon-exchange potential
is taken the same as for low-lying charmonium states, then in the CC approach
$\Gamma_1= \Gamma(X(3872)\rightarrow J/\psi\gamma) \sim 3$~keV is very small,
giving the large ratio $R_{\psi\gamma}=\frac{\mathcal{B}(X(3872)\rightarrow
\psi(2S)\gamma)}{\mathcal{B}(X(3872)\rightarrow J/\psi\gamma)}\gg 1.0$.
Arguments are presented why the gluon-exchange interaction may be suppressed
for $X(3872)$ and in this case $\Gamma_1=42.7$~keV, $\Gamma_2= 70.5$~keV, and
$R_{\psi\gamma}=1.65$ are predicted for the minimal value $c_{\rm X}({\rm

importance of confined acoustic phonons in the spin relaxation of dark

introduces a new global constraint called exists-embedding. This formulation is
the most efficient but does not support one type of constraint. To support such
constraints, we develop a second formulation that is more general but incurs
more overhead. Both formulations can use the projected database technique used
in specialised algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the flexibility towards
constraint-based settings and compare the approach to existing methods.

the repository of stellar ejecta and the birthsite of new stars and, hence, a
key factor in the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time. Cold, diffuse, atomic
clouds are a key component of the ISM, but so far this phase has been difficult
to study, because its main tracer, the HI 21 cm line, does not constrain the
basic physical information of the gas (e.g., temperature, density) well. The
SKA opens up the opportunity to study this component of the ISM through a
complementary tracer in the form of low-frequency (<350 MHz) carbon radio
recombination lines (CRRL). These CRRLs provide a sensitive probe of the
physical conditions in cold, diffuse clouds. The superb sensitivity, large
field of view, frequency resolution and coverage of the SKA allows for
efficient surveys of the sky, that will revolutionize the field of
low-frequency recombination line studies. By observing these lines with the SKA
we will be able determine the thermal balance, chemical enrichment, and
ionization rate of the cold, atomic medium from degree-scales down to scales
corresponding to individual clouds and filaments in our Galaxy, the Magellanic
Clouds and beyond. Furthermore, being sensitive only to the cold, atomic gas,
observations of low-frequency CRRLs with the SKA will aid in disentangling the
warm and cold constituents of the HI 21 cm emission.

us to establish that this unexpected phenomenon is caused by an outflowing
stream of weakly ionised gas (called the obscurer), extending from the vicinity
of the accretion disk to the broad-line region. In this work we present the
details of our campaign and the data obtained by all the observatories. We
determine the spectral energy distribution of NGC 5548 from near-infrared to
hard X-rays by establishing the contribution of various emission and absorption
processes taking place along our line of sight towards the central engine. We
thus uncover the intrinsic emission and produce a broadband continuum model for
both obscured (average summer 2013 data) and unobscured ($<$ 2011) epochs of

single Comptonised component with its higher energy tail creating the 'soft
X-ray excess'. This component is compatible with emission from a warm,
optically-thick corona as part of the inner accretion disk. We then investigate
the effects of the continuum on the ionisation balance and thermal stability of
photoionised gas for unobscured and obscured epochs.

mechanism of wind production. For this aim, we make use of a three dimensional
GRMHD simulation of hot accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. The
simulation is designed so that the magnetic flux is not accumulated
significantly around the black hole. To distinguish real wind from turbulent
outflows, we track the trajectories of the virtual Largrangian particles from
simulation data. We find two types of real outflows, i.e., a quasi-relativistic
jet close to the axis and a sub-relativistic wind subtending a much larger
solid angle. Most of the wind originates from the surface layer of the
accretion flow. The poloidal wind speed almost remains constant once they are
produced, but the flux-weighted wind speed roughly follows $v_{\rm p,
wind}(r)\approx 0.25 v_k(r)$. The mass flux of jet is much lower but the speed
is much higher, $v_{\rm p,jet}\sim (0.3-0.4) c$. Consequently, both the energy
and momentum fluxes of the wind are much larger than those of the jet. We find
that the wind is produced and accelerated primarily by the combination of
centrifugal force and magnetic pressure gradient, while the jet is mainly
accelerated by magnetic pressure gradient. Finally, we find that the wind
production efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm wind}\equiv\dot{E}_{\rm wind}/\dot{M}_{\rm

$\mathscr B$-free numbers with Sarnak's conjecture on the `randomness' of the
M\""obius function, another the explicit computability of correlation functions
as well as eigenfunctions for these systems together with intrinsic ergodicity
properties. Here, we summarise some of the results, with focus on spectral and
dynamical aspects, and expand a little on the implications for mathematical

behavioral features to continuously authenticate smartphone users. HMOG
features unobtrusively capture subtle micro-movement and orientation dynamics
resulting from how a user grasps, holds, and taps on the smartphone. We
evaluated authentication and biometric key generation (BKG) performance of HMOG
features on data collected from 100 subjects typing on a virtual keyboard. Data
was collected under two conditions: sitting and walking. We achieved
authentication EERs as low as 7.16% (walking) and 10.05% (sitting) when we
combined HMOG, tap, and keystroke features. We performed experiments to
investigate why HMOG features perform well during walking. Our results suggest
that this is due to the ability of HMOG features to capture distinctive body
movements caused by walking, in addition to the hand-movement dynamics from
taps. With BKG, we achieved EERs of 15.1% using HMOG combined with taps. In
comparison, BKG using tap, key hold, and swipe features had EERs between 25.7%
and 34.2%. We also analyzed the energy consumption of HMOG feature extraction
and computation. Our analysis shows that HMOG features extracted at 16Hz sensor
sampling rate incurred a minor overhead of 7.9% without sacrificing
authentication accuracy. Two points distinguish our work from current
literature: 1) we present the results of a comprehensive evaluation of three
types of features (HMOG, keystroke, and tap) and their combinations under the

perspectives (authentication, BKG, and energy consumption on smartphones).

quantifies the effect of infinitesimal perturbations in the data. Furthermore

The asymptotic biasedness of the estimators make the calculations nonstandard.

motion of a massless particle (a comet) under the gravitational field of two
massive bodies (the primaries, say the Sun and Jupiter) revolving around their
center of mass on elliptic orbits with some positive eccentricity. The aim of
this paper is to show the existence of orbits whose angular momentum performs
arbitrary excursions in a large region. In particular, there exist diffusive
orbits, that is, with a large variation of angular momentum.
  The leading idea of the proof consists in analysing parabolic motions of the
comet. By a well-known result of McGehee, the union of future (resp. past)
parabolic orbits is an analytic manifold. In a properly chosen coordinate
system these manifolds are stable (resp. unstable) manifolds of a manifold at
infinity $P_\infty$, which we call manifold at parabolic infinity.
  On this manifold, it is possible to define two scattering maps, which contain
the map structure of the homoclinic trajectories to it, i.e. orbits parabolic
both in the future and the past. Since the inner dynamics inside $P_\infty$ is
trivial, two different scattering maps are used. The combination of these two
scattering maps permits the design of the desired diffusive pseudo-orbits.
Using shadowing techniques and these pseudo orbits we show the existence of
true trajectories of the RPETBP whose angular momentum varies in any
predetermined fashion.

pace faster than what is commonly seen in blazars. The flaring events show
intensive spectral evolution indicative of shock evolution. The brightness

models (28 salient object detection, 10 fixation prediction, 1 objectness, and
1 baseline) over 6 challenging datasets for the purpose of benchmarking salient
object detection and segmentation methods. From the results obtained so far,
our evaluation shows a consistent rapid progress over the last few years in
terms of both accuracy and running time. The top contenders in this benchmark
significantly outperform the models identified as the best in the previous
benchmark conducted just two years ago. We find that the models designed
specifically for salient object detection generally work better than models in
closely related areas, which in turn provides a precise definition and suggests
an appropriate treatment of this problem that distinguishes it from other
problems. In particular, we analyze the influences of center bias and scene
complexity in model performance, which, along with the hard cases for
state-of-the-art models, provide useful hints towards constructing more
challenging large scale datasets and better saliency models. Finally, we
propose probable solutions for tackling several open problems such as
evaluation scores and dataset bias, which also suggest future research
directions in the rapidly-growing field of salient object detection.

horizon of the universe. We have considered $f(T, \mathcal T)=T + \gamma

reconstruction. We observe that the derived $f(T,\mathcal T)$ models can
represent phantom or quintessence regimes of the universe which are compatible
with the current observational data.

  overlap with arXiv:1411.3929",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Imaging and Image sensors is a field that is continuously evolving. There are
new products coming into the market every day. Some of these have very severe
Size, Weight and Power constraints whereas other devices have to handle very
high computational loads. Some require both these conditions to be met
simultaneously. Current imaging architectures and digital image processing
solutions will not be able to meet these ever increasing demands. There is a
need to develop novel imaging architectures and image processing solutions to
address these requirements. In this work we propose analog signal processing as
a solution to this problem. The analog processor is not suggested as a
replacement to a digital processor but it will be used as an augmentation
device which works in parallel with the digital processor, making the system
faster and more efficient. In order to show the merits of analog processing two
stereo correspondence algorithms are implemented. We propose novel
modifications to the algorithms and new imaging architectures which,
significantly reduces the computation time.
