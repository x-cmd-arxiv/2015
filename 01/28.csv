study the different nuclear shapes. However, the possibility of testing
octupole deformation of a nucleus with this tool has not been fully explored
yet. The presence of a stactic octupole deformation in nuclei will enhanced a
possible permanent electric dipole moment, leading to a possible demonstration
of parity violation.
  $\textit{Purpose}$: To check whether static octupole deformation or octupole
vibration in fusion give qualitatively different results so that both
situations can be experimentally disentangled.
  $\textit{Method}$: Fusion cross sections are computed in the Coupled-Channels
formalism making use of the Ingoing-Wave Boundary Conditions (IWBC) for the
systems $^{16}$O+$^{144}$Ba and $^{16}$O+$^{224}$Ra.
  $\textit{Results}$: Barrier distributions of the two considered schemes show
different patterns. For the $^{224}$Ra case, the octupole deformation parameter

representative example: the Heisenberg XXZ model. The focus lies on the
structure of the CBA and on its main results, deferring a detailed treatment of
the CBA for the general $M$-particle sector of the XXZ model to an appendix.
Subsequently the transfer-matrix method is discussed for the six-vertex model,
uncovering a relation between that model and the XXZ spin chain. Equipped with
this background the quantum inverse-scattering method (QISM) and algebraic
Bethe ansatz (ABA) are treated. We emphasize the use of graphical notation for

in cosmic rays (CR). It seems important to study all baryon data that are
available from collider experiments in wide range of energies. Transverse
momentum spectra of baryons from RHIC ($\sqrt(s)$=62 and 200 GeV) and from LHC
($\sqrt(s)$=0.9 and 7 TeV) have been considered. It is seen that the slope of
distributions at low $p_T$'s is changing with energy. The QGSM fit of these
spectra gives the average transverse momenta which behave as $s^{0.06}$ that is
similar to the previously observed behavior of $\Lambda^0$ hyperon spectra. The
change in average transverse momenta that are slowly growing in VHE hadron
interactions at CR detectors cannot cause the ""knee"" in measured cosmic ray
proton spectra. In addition, the available data on heavy quark hadron
production from LHC-b at $\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV were also studied. The preliminary
dependence of hadron average transverse momenta on their masses at LHC energy
is presented. The possible source of cosmic ray antiparticle-to-particle ratios
that are growing with energy was analyzed in the framework of QGSM, where the
growing ratios are the result of local leading asymmetry between the production
spectra of baryons and antibaryons in the kinematical region of proton target
fragmentation. In the laboratory system of cosmic ray measurements this
spectrum asymmetry will be seen as growing ratio of secondary
antiparticle-to-particle spectra until the certain energy of secondaries. This
conclusion makes the particle production at the sources of very high energy
cosmic protons important, if the interactions with positive target matter would
have place in proximity of these sources.

dynamics of these techno-social systems, little is known about fundamental
aspects such as how collective attention arises and what determines the
information life-cycle. Current approaches to these problems either focus on
human temporal dynamics or on semiotic dynamics. In addition, as recently
shown, information ecosystems are highly competitive, with humans and memes
striving for scarce resources -visibility and attention, respectively. Inspired
by similar problems in ecology, here we develop a methodology that allows to
cast all the previous aspects into a compact framework and to characterize,
using microblogging data, information-driven systems as mutualistic networks.
Our results show that collective attention around a topic is reached when the
user-meme network self-adapts from a modular to a nested structure, which
ultimately allows minimizing competition and attaining consensus. Beyond a
sociological interpretation, we explore such resemblance to natural mutualistic
communities via well-known dynamics of ecological systems.

excitonic corrections, and screening from high energy excitations involving the

the range 0.25 to 0.35, which is higher than our previous result of 0.14, but
still below the value expected from RPA. We show the reduced value is not a
consequence of interlayer hopping effects, which were ignored in our previous
analysis, but of a combination of excitonic effects in the $\pi \rightarrow
\pi^*$ particle-hole continuum, and background screening from the
$\sigma$-bonded electrons. We find that $\sigma$-band screening is extremely
strong at distances of the order of a few nm, and should be highly effective at
screening out short-distance, Hubbard-like interactions in graphene, as well as

graphene based Josephson junctions with one-dimensional edge contacts of

graphene has a high quality due to its encapsulation in hexagonal boron

new regime, characterized by ballistic transport. We find that the critical
current oscillates with the carrier density due to phase coherent interference
of the electrons and holes that carry the supercurrent caused by the formation
of a Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity. Furthermore, relatively large supercurrents are
observed over unprecedented long distances of up to 1.5 $\mu$m. Finally, in the

recently categorized as a black widow in which a recycled millisecond pulsar
(MSP) is evaporating up the companion star with its powerful pulsar wind. Our
optical observations show clear sinusoidal light curves due to the asymmetric
temperature distribution of the companion star. Assuming a simple geometry, we
constrained the range of the inclination angle of the binary system to
52$^{\circ}$ < i < 59$^{\circ}$, which enables us to discuss the interaction
between the pulsar wind and the companion in detail. The X-ray spectrum
consists of two components: a soft, steady component that seems to originate
from the surface of the MSP, and a hard variable component from the
wind-termination shock near the companion star. The measured X-ray luminosity
is comparable to the bolometric luminosity of the companion, meaning that the
heating efficiency is less than 0.5. In the companion orbit, 10$^{11}$ cm from
the pulsar, the pulsar wind is already in particle dominant-stage, with a
magnetization parameter of $\sigma$ < 0.1. In addition, we precisely
investigated the time variations of the X-ray periodograms and detected a
weakening of orbital modulation. The observed phenomenon may be related to an
unstable pulsar-wind activity or a weak mass accretion, both of which can

much higher than that of the warm ionized medium in the disk. The column

distribution of the number of summands in the Zeckendorf decompositions of $m

normal. The proofs crucially used the fact that all integers in $[F_n,

linear recurrence sequences $\{G_n\}$.
  We generalize these results to subintervals of $[G_n, G_{n+1})$ as $n \to

as different integers have different sets of potential summands. Explicitly,
fix an integer sequence $\alpha(n) \to \infty$. As $n \to \infty$, for almost

generalized Zeckendorf decompositions of integers in the subintervals $[m, m +

The proof follows by showing that, with probability tending to $1$, $m$ has at
least one appropriately located large gap between indices in its decomposition.
We then use a correspondence between this interval and $[0, G_{\alpha(n)})$ to
obtain the result, since the summands are known to have Gaussian behavior in

(SNe Ia) can enable the use of SNe Ia, measured only with photometry, to probe
cosmology. This dramatically increases the science return of supernova surveys
planned for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). In this paper we
describe a significantly improved version of the simple analytic photo-z
estimator proposed by Wang (2007) and further developed by Wang, Narayan, and
Wood-Vasey (2007). We apply it to 55,422 simulated SNe Ia generated using the
SNANA package with the LSST filters. We find that the estimated errors on the
photo-z's, \sigma_{z_{phot}}/(1+z_{phot}), can be used as filters to produce a
set of photo-z's that have high precision, accuracy, and purity. Using SN Ia
colors as well as SN Ia peak magnitude in the i band, we obtain a set of
photo-z's with 2 percent accuracy (with \sigma(z_{phot}-z_{spec})/(1+z_{spec})
= 0.02), a bias in z_{phot} (the mean of z_{phot}-z_{spec}) of -9 X 10^{-5},
and an outlier fraction (with |(z_{phot}-z_{spec})/(1+z_{spec})|>0.1) of 0.23
percent, with the requirement that \sigma_{z_{phot}}/(1+z_{phot})<0.01. Using
the SN Ia colors only, we obtain a set of photo-z's with similar quality by
requiring that \sigma_{z_{phot}}/(1+z_{phot})<0.007; this leads to a set of

galaxies from z~3 to the present by studying the evolution with redshift of the
quiescent and spheroid-dominated fractions of galaxies from the CANDELS and
GAMA surveys. We compare the observed fractions with predictions from a
semi-analytic model which includes prescriptions for bulge growth and AGN
feedback due to mergers and disk instabilities. We facilitate direct
morphological comparison by converting our model bulge-to-total stellar mass
ratios to Sersic indices. We then subdivide our population into the four
quadrants of the sSFR-Sersic index plane and study the buildup of each of these
subpopulations. We find that the fraction of star forming disks declines
steadily, while the fraction of quiescent spheroids builds up over cosmic time.
The fractions of star forming spheroids and quiescent disks are both
non-negligible, and stay nearly constant over the period we have studied, at
about 10% and 15-20% respectively. Our model is qualitatively successful at
reproducing the evolution of the two ""main"" populations (star forming
disk-dominated galaxies and quiescent spheroid-dominated galaxies), and
approximately reproduces the relative fractions of all four types, but predicts
a stronger decline in star forming spheroids, and increase in quiescent disks,
than seen in the observations. A model with an additional channel for bulge
growth via disk instabilities agrees better overall with the observations than
a model in which bulges may grow only through mergers. We study evolutionary
tracks of some individual galaxies as they experience morphological
transformation and quenching, and examine the importance of different physical
drivers of this transformation (major and minor mergers and disk
instabilities). We find that complex histories with multiple transformative
events are the norm.

  Minimization",,,,,"cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of constructing approximations to a weighted automaton.
Weighted finite automata (WFA) are closely related to the theory of rational
series. A rational series is a function from strings to real numbers that can
be computed by a finite WFA. Among others, this includes probability
distributions generated by hidden Markov models and probabilistic automata. The
relationship between rational series and WFA is analogous to the relationship
between regular languages and ordinary automata. Associated with such rational
series are infinite matrices called Hankel matrices which play a fundamental
role in the theory of minimal WFA. Our contributions are: (1) an effective
procedure for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of such infinite
Hankel matrices based on their representation in terms of finite WFA; (2) a new
canonical form for finite WFA based on this SVD decomposition; and, (3) an
algorithm to construct approximate minimizations of a given WFA. The goal of
our approximate minimization algorithm is to start from a minimal WFA and
produce a smaller WFA that is close to the given one in a certain sense. The
desired size of the approximating automaton is given as input. We give bounds
describing how well the approximation emulates the behavior of the original
WFA.

  Learning from noisy data",,,"10.1016/j.physd.2016.01.012",,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we apply a recently developed nonparametric modeling approach,
the ""diffusion forecast"", to predict the time-evolution of Fourier modes of
turbulent dynamical systems. While the diffusion forecasting method assumes the
availability of a noise-free training data set observing the full state space
of the dynamics, in real applications we often have only partial observations
which are corrupted by noise. To alleviate these practical issues, following
the theory of embedology, the diffusion model is built using the
delay-embedding coordinates of the data. We show that this delay embedding
biases the geometry of the data in a way which extracts the most stable
component of the dynamics and reduces the influence of independent additive
observation noise. The resulting diffusion forecast model approximates the
semigroup solutions of the generator of the underlying dynamics in the limit of
large data and when the observation noise vanishes. As in any standard
forecasting problem, the forecasting skill depends crucially on the accuracy of
the initial conditions. We introduce a novel Bayesian method for filtering the
discrete-time noisy observations which works with the diffusion forecast to
determine the forecast initial densities.
  Numerically, we compare this nonparametric approach with standard stochastic
parametric models on a wide-range of well-studied turbulent modes, including
the Lorenz-96 model in weakly chaotic to fully turbulent regimes and the
barotropic modes of a quasi-geostrophic model with baroclinic instabilities. We
show that when the only available data is the low-dimensional set of noisy
modes that are being modeled, the diffusion forecast is indeed competitive to
the perfect model.

these spectral features. In this paper, we present the first results of a deep
250 ks NuSTAR observation of 1H0707-495, which includes the first sensitive

source in an extreme low-flux state, the Compton hump is still significantly
detected. NuSTAR, with its high effective area above 7 keV, clearly detects the
drop in flux in the iron K alpha band, and by comparing these observations with
archival XMM-Newton observations, we find that the energy of this drop
increases with increasing flux. We discuss possible explanations for this, the
most likely of which is that the drop in flux is the blue wing of the
relativistically broadened iron K alpha emission line. When the flux is low,
the coronal source height is low, thus enhancing the most gravitationally
redshifted emission.

control scheme where each UE independently adapts its transmit power on its

In the proposed scheme, the UEs can dynamically switch their objectives between
data rate maximization and transmit power minimization as the backhaul load
varies. Given the coupling between interference and the backhaul load, we
propose a low-overhead convergence mechanism which does not require explicit
coordination between autonomous nodes and also derive a closed-form expression
of the transmit power levels at equilibrium. We illustrate a higher aggregate
end-to-end data rate and significant power saving for our scheme over when the
optimization is implemented through a greedy algorithm or when UEs only perform

quickly evolved and found applications in theoretical and applied mechanism
science. We provide an accessible introduction to motion factorization with
many examples, summarize recent developments and hint at some new applications.
In particular, we provide pseudo-code for the generic factorization algorithm,
demonstrate how to find a replacement linkage for a special case in the
synthesis of Bennett mechanisms and, as an example of non-generic
factorization, synthesize open chains for circular and elliptic translations.

expensive. At the same time, the need for precise calibration of these devices
(ranging from tiny sensors to space telescopes) manifests itself as a major
roadblock in many scientific and technological endeavors. To achieve optimal
performance of advanced high-performance sensors one must carefully calibrate
them, which is often difficult or even impossible to do in practice. In this
work we bring together three seemingly unrelated concepts, namely
Self-Calibration, Compressive Sensing, and Biconvex Optimization. The idea
behind self-calibration is to equip a hardware device with a smart algorithm
that can compensate automatically for the lack of calibration. We show how
several self-calibration problems can be treated efficiently within the
framework of biconvex compressive sensing via a new method called SparseLift.
More specifically, we consider a linear system of equations y = DAx, where both
x and the diagonal matrix D (which models the calibration error) are unknown.
By ""lifting"" this biconvex inverse problem we arrive at a convex optimization
problem. By exploiting sparsity in the signal model, we derive explicit
theoretical guarantees under which both x and D can be recovered exactly,
robustly, and numerically efficiently via linear programming. Applications in
array calibration and wireless communications are discussed and numerical
simulations are presented, confirming and complementing our theoretical
analysis.

network, where attractive and repulsive couplings are balanced dynamically due
to nonlinearity in interaction. Under a week force, an oscillator tends to
follow the phase of its neighbors, but if an oscillator is compelled to follow
its peers by a sufficient large number of cohesive neighbors, then it actually
starts to act in the opposite manner, i.e. in anti-phase with the majority.
Analytic results yield that if the repulsion parameter is small enough in
comparison with the degree of the maximum hub, then the full synchronization
state is locally stable. Numerical experiments are performed to explore the
model beyond this threshold, where the overall cohesion is lost. We report in
detail partially synchronous dynamical regimes, like stationary phase-locking,
multistability, periodic and chaotic states. Via statistical analysis of
different network organizations like tree, scale-free, and random ones, and
different network sizes, we found a measure allowing one to predict relative
abundance of partially synchronous stationary states in comparison to
time-dependent ones.

inelastic light (Raman) scattering study of the structural changes that precede
the pressure-tuned charge-density-wave (CDW) to superconductor transition in
one such system, ZrTe3. In certain phonon bands, we observe dramatic linewidth
reductions that accompany CDW formation, indicating that these phonons couple
strongly to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the CDW. The same
phonon bands, which represent internal vibrations of ZrTe3 prismatic chains,
are suppressed at pressures above ~10 kbar, indicating a loss of long-range
order within the chains, specifically amongst intrachain Zr-Te bonds. These
results suggest a distinct structural mechanism for the observed

desiccated M dwarf terrestrial exoplanets using a 1-dimensional photochemical
model. Around Sun-like stars, CO2 photolysis by Far-UV (FUV) radiation is
balanced by recombination reactions that depend on water abundance. Planets
orbiting M dwarf stars experience more FUV radiation, and could be depleted in
water due to M dwarfs' prolonged, high-luminosity pre-main sequences (Luger &
Barnes 2015). We show that, for water-depleted M dwarf terrestrial planets, a
catalytic cycle relying on H2O2 photolysis can maintain a CO2 atmosphere.
However, this cycle breaks down for atmospheric hydrogen mixing ratios <1 ppm,
resulting in ~40% of the atmospheric CO2 being converted to CO and O2 on a time
scale of 1 Myr. The increased O2 abundance leads to high O3 concentrations, the
photolysis of which forms another CO2-regenerating catalytic cycle. For
atmospheres with <0.1 ppm hydrogen, CO2 is produced directly from the
recombination of CO and O. These catalytic cycles place an upper limit of ~50%
on the amount of CO2 that can be destroyed via photolysis, which is enough to
generate Earth-like abundances of (abiotic) O2 and O3. The conditions that lead
to such high oxygen levels could be widespread on planets in the habitable
zones of M dwarfs. Discrimination between biological and abiotic O2 and O3 in
this case can perhaps be accomplished by noting the lack of water features in
the reflectance and emission spectra of these planets, which necessitates
observations at wavelengths longer than 0.95 microns.

reveal patterns that---when observed in the collision of heavy nuclei---are
commonly interpreted as indicators of a locally equilibrated system in
collective motion. The comparison of these data sets, including the forthcoming
results from p+Au and p+Al collisions at RHIC, will help to elucidate the
geometric dependence of such patterns. It has recently been shown that
A-Multi-Phase-Transport-Model (AMPT) can describe some of these features in LHC
data with a parton-parton scattering cross section comparable to that required
to describe A+A data. In this paper, we extend these studies by incorporating a
full wave function description of the $^3$He nucleus to calculate elliptical
and triangular anisotropy moments $v_2$ and $v_3$ for p+Au, d+Au and $^3$He+Au
collisions at the RHIC top energy of 200 GeV. We find reasonable agreement with
the measured $v_2$ in d+Au and $^3$He+Au and $v_3$ in $^3$He+Au for transverse
momentum ($p_{T}$) $\lesssim$ 1 GeV/c, but underestimate these measurements for
higher values of \pt. We predict a pattern of coefficients ($v_{2}$, $v_{3}$)
for \pau, dominated by differences in the number of induced local hot spots
(i.e. one, two, or three) arising from intrinsic geometry. Additionally, we
examine how this substantial azimuthal anisotropy accrues during each

low energy nuclear astrophysics experiments. Adopting ideas from dark matter
detection with superheated liquids, a detector system compatible with gamma-ray
beams has been developed. This detector alleviates some of the limitations
encountered in standard measurements of the minute cross sections of interest
to stellar environments. While the astrophysically relevant nuclear reaction
processes at hydrostatic burning temperatures are dominated by radiative
captures, in this experimental scheme we measure the time-reversed processes.
Such photodisintegrations allow us to compute the radiative capture cross
sections when transitions to excited states of the reaction products are
negligible. Due to the transformation of phase space, the photodisintegration
cross sections are up to two orders of magnitude higher. The main advantage of
the new target-detector system is a density several orders of magnitude higher
than conventional gas targets. Also, the detector is virtually insensitive to
the gamma-ray beam itself, thus allowing us to detect only the products of the
nuclear reaction of interest. The development and the operation as well as the
advantages and disadvantages of the bubble chamber are discussed.

systems. Flows in such media can be described by three path functions
$\Lambda_\alpha$, or, for a steady flow, by two stream functions
$\lambda_\kappa$ and an additional field such as the mass density $\rho$,
velocity $v$, or travel time $\Delta t$. While typical analyses of a frozen

general, local (in $\Lambda$ or $\lambda$ space) solution
$\boldsymbol{B}=(\partial\boldsymbol{x}/\partial\Lambda_\alpha)_t
\tilde{B}_\alpha \rho/\tilde{\rho}$, where Lagrangian constants denoted by a
tilde are directly fixed at a boundary hypersurface $\tilde{H}$ on which
$\boldsymbol{B}$ is known. For a steady flow,
$\tilde{\rho}\boldsymbol{B}/\rho=(\partial\boldsymbol{x}/\partial\lambda_\kappa)_{\Delta

special cases include compressible axisymmetric flows and incompressible flows
around a sphere, showing that viscosity and compressibility enhance the
magnetization and lead to thicker boundary layers. Our method is especially
useful for directly computing electric fields, and for addressing upstream
magnetic fields that vary in spacetime. We thus estimate the electric fields
above heliospheres and magnetospheres, compute the draping of magnetic
substructure around a planetary body, and demonstrate the resulting inverse
polarity reversal layer. Our analysis can be incorporated into existing

geophysical inverse problem, when there are only a few possible physical
property values in the model and they are reasonably known but the geometry of
the target is sought. The model consists of a fixed background and many small
""particles"" as building blocks that float around in the background to resemble
the target by clustering. This approach contrasts the conventional geometric
inversions requiring the target to be regularly shaped bodies, since here the
geometry of the target can be arbitrary and does not need to be known
beforehand. Because of the lack of resolution in the data, the particles may
not necessarily cluster when recovering compact targets. A model norm, called
distribution norm, is introduced to quantify the spread of particles and
incorporated into the objective function to encourage further clustering of the
particles. As proof of concept, 1D magnetotelluric inversion is used as
example. My experiments reveal that the particles, starting from a fully
scattered distribution, are able to move towards the actual target location;
the quality of recovery depends on whether there is enough material (vertical
conductance in 1D) in the particles to build the target; and the use of
distribution norm can help produce tightened clustering. When the inversion
struggles to fit the data, it may indicate that the prior information about the
particles' conductivity and size are incorrect.

moment close to the value expected for the low spin state S = 1 .
Full-multiplet cluster calculations indicate that the low spin state is quite
stable and suggest that the occurrence of a transition to the high spin state S
= 2 in strained thin films of SrRuO3 is unlikely as it would be too expensive

is oriented along the direction of the radio jet. The other two components
exhibit diffuse morphology together with arc-like structures also oriented
along the radio jet direction. Furthermore, the ionization level of the gas is
found to decrease from the more collimated component to the more diffuse

confirm our earlier results that the outer filament and the nearby HI cloud are
likely partially shaped by the lateral expansion of the jet. The arc-like
structures embedded within the two remaining components are the clearest
evidence of a smooth jet-ISM interaction along the jet direction. This suggests
that, although poorly collimated, the radio jet is still active and has an
impact on the surrounding gas. This result indicates that the effect on the ISM

observed in dSphs, but the initial [C/Fe] of the dSph giants is not uniform.
Stars in dSphs at lower metallicities have larger [C/Fe] ratios. We hypothesize
that [C/Fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines with
increasing [Fe/H] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield of
asymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of Type Ia
supernovae at higher metallicities. We also identified 11 very carbon-rich
giants (8 previously known) in three dSphs. However, our selection biases
preclude a detailed comparison to the carbon-enhanced fraction of the Milky Way
stellar halo. Nonetheless, the stars with [C/Fe] < +1 in dSphs follow a
different [C/Fe] track with [Fe/H] than the halo stars. Specifically, [C/Fe] in
dSphs begins to decline at lower [Fe/H] than in the halo. The difference in the
metallicity of the [C/Fe] ""knee"" adds to the evidence from [alpha/Fe]
distributions that the progenitors of the halo had a shorter timescale for
chemical enrichment than the surviving dSphs.

connection between continuum radio and dust emission of star-forming galaxies,
often used as a tool in determining star-formation rates. Here we expand the
point made by Murphy (2013) that in the case of some interacting star-forming
galaxies there is a non-thermal emission from the gas bridge in between them,
which might cause a dispersion in this correlation. Galactic interactions and
mergers have been known to give rise to tidal shocks and disrupt morphologies
especially in the smaller of the interacting components. Here we point out that
these shocks can also heat the gas and dust and will inevitably accelerate
particles and result in a tidal cosmic-ray population in addition to standard
galactic cosmic rays in the galaxy itself. This would result in a non-thermal
emission not only from the gas bridges of interacting systems, but from
interacting galaxies as a whole in general. Thus both tidal heating and
additional non-thermal radiation will obviously affect the FIR-radio
correlation of these systems, the only question is how much. In this scenario
the FIR-radio correlation is not stable in interacting galaxies, but rather
evolves as the interaction/merger progresses. To test this hypothesis and probe
the possible impact of tidal cosmic ray population we have analyzed a sample of
43 infrared bright star-forming interacting galaxies at different merger
stages. We have found that their FIR-radio correlation parameter and radio
emission spectral index vary noticeably over different merger stages and behave
as it would be expected from our tidal-shock scenario. Important implications
of departure of interacting galaxies from the FIR-radio correlation are
discussed.

in the inner part of protoplanetary discs where magnetic turbulence is
expected. The thermal equilibrium curve consists of the upper, lower, and
middle branches. The upper (lower) branch corresponds to hot (cool) and
optically very (moderately) thick discs, respectively, while the middle branch
is characterized by convective energy transport near the midplane. Convection
is also the major energy transport process near the low surface density end of
the upper branch. There, convective motion is fast with Mach numbers reaching
$\gtrsim 0.01$, and enhances both magnetic turbulence and cooling, raising the
ratio of vertically-integrated shear stress to vertically-integrated pressure
by a factor of several. This convectively enhanced ratio seems a robust feature
in accretion discs having an ionization transition. We have also examined
causes of the S-shaped thermal equilibrium curve, as well as the thermal
stability of the equilibrium solutions. Finally, we compared our results with
the disc instability models used to explain FU Ori outbursts. Although the
thermal equilibrium curve in our results also exhibits bistability, the surface
density contrast across the bistability is an order of magnitude smaller, and
the stress-to-pressure ratios in both upper and lower branches are two orders
of magnitude greater, than those favored in the disc instability models. It
therefore appears likely that FU Ori outbursts are not due solely to a
thermal-viscous limit cycle resulting from accretion driven by local magnetic
turbulence.

composition of the surface material. Using a combination of semi-analytic and
simple numerical models, I explore when turbulent mixing due to hydrodynamic
instabilities during the accretion process can mix C/O core material up into
the accreted helium. Mixing is strongest at high accretion rates, large white
dwarf (WD) masses, and slow spin rates. The mixing would result in subsequent
helium burning that better matches the observed properties of SNe Ia. In some
cases, there is considerable mixing that can lead to more than 50% C/O in the
accreted layer at the time of ignition. These results will hopefully motivate
future theoretical studies of such strongly mixed conditions. Mixing also has
implications for other types of WD surface explosions, including the so-called

of magnetic fields on abundance determination. We obtain a good match of the
synthetic disc-centre continuum intensity to the absolute continuum values from
the FTS observational spectrum; the match of the centre-to-limb variation (CLV)
synthetic data to observations is also good, thanks, in part, to the 3D
radiation transfer capabilities of the RH code. The different levels of
magnetic flux in the numerical time-series do not modify the quality of the
match. Concerning the targetted [O I] spectral lines, we find, instead, that
magnetic fields lead to non-negligible changes in the synthetic spectrum, with
larger average magnetic flux causing the line to become noticeably weaker. The

we focus on particular realizations and show numerically that they exhibit

the quantization of corresponding invariants. These results demonstrate that

the standard cold dark matter scenario, but with a Jeans length at the scale of
the Compton wavelength of the scalar particle. Contrary to previous analyses in
the literature our results do not rely on time-averages and/or fluid
identifications, and instead we solve both analytically (in terms of a
well-defined series expansion) and numerically the linearized
Einstein-Klein-Gordon system. Also, we use gauge-invariant fields, which makes
the physical analysis more transparent and simplifies the comparison with
previous works carried out in different gauges. As a byproduct of this study we
identify a time-dependent modulation of the different physical quantities
associated to the background as well as the perturbations with potential
observational consequences in dark matter models.

one-loop correction to the inflaton potential involving this field can induce a
temporary running of the spectral index. The induced running can be a short
burst of strong running, which may be related to the observed anomalies on
large scales in the cosmic microwave spectrum, or extend over many e-folds,
sustaining an effectively constant running to be searched for in the future. We
implement this in a general class of models, where effects are mediated through
a heavy messenger field sitting in its minimum. Interestingly, within the
present framework it is a generic outcome that a large running implies a small
field model with a vanishing tensor-to-scalar ratio, circumventing the normal
expectation that small field models typically lead to an unobservable small
running of the spectral index. An observable level of tensor modes can also be
accommodated, but, surprisingly, this requires running to be induced by a
curvaton. If upcoming observations are consistent with a small tensor-to-scalar
ratio as predicted by small field models of inflation, then the present study
serves as an explicit example contrary to the general expectation that the
running will be unobservable.

comparative analysis of three leading models recently used to study
synchronization dynamics in power-grid networks -- a fundamental problem of
practical significance given that frequency synchronization of all power
generators in the same interconnection is a necessary condition for a power
grid to operate. We show that each of these models can be derived from first

us to view power grids as complex networks of coupled second-order phase

examples, test systems, and real power-grid datasets, we study the inherent
frequencies of the oscillators as well as their coupling structure, comparing
across the different models. We demonstrate, in particular, that if the network
structure is not homogeneous, generators with identical parameters need to be
modeled as non-identical oscillators in general. We also discuss an approach to
estimate the required (dynamical) parameters that are unavailable in typical

selected from the SDSS DR7 and their stellar content is analysed. We apply an
age dependent dust attenuation correction and derive star formation rates
(SFR), ages and masses of the young and old populations. The photometric masses
nicely agree with dynamical masses derived from the H-alpha emission line
width. To select SB galaxies, we use the birthrate parameter b=SFR/<SFR>,
requiring b>=3. The PB sample is selected from the citerion EW(Hdelta_abs)>=6
A. Only 1% of star-forming galaxies are found to be SB galaxies. They
contribute 3-6% to the stellar production and are therefore unimportant for the
local star formation activity. The median SB age is 70 Myr, roughly independent
of mass. The b-parameter strongly depends on burst age. Values close to b=60
are found at ages ~10 Myr, while almost no SBs are found at ages >1 Gyr. The
median baryonic burst mass fraction of sub-L* galaxies is 5%, decreasing slowly
with mass. The median mass fraction of the recent burst in the PB sample is
5-10%. The age-mass distribution of the progenitors of the PBs is bimodal with
a break at log(M)~10.6 above which the ages are doubled. The SB and PB
luminosity functions (hereafter LFs) follow each other closely until M_r~-21,
when AGNs begin to dominate. The PB LF continues to follow the AGN LF while SB
loose significance. This suggests that the number of luminous SBs is
underestimated by about one dex at high luminosities, due to large amounts of
dust and/or AGN blending. It also indicates that the SB phase preceded the AGN
phase. We also discuss the conditions for global gas outflow caused by stellar
feedback.

of diffuse synchrotron radio emission, known as radio halos and relics, which
demonstrate the presence of magnetic fields and relativistic electrons in
clusters. These relativistic electrons should also emit X-rays through
inverse-Compton scattering off of cosmic microwave background photons. The
detection of such a non-thermal X-ray component, together with the radio
measurement, would permit to clearly separate the magnetic field from the
relativistic electron distribution as the inverse-Compton emission is
independent from the magnetic field in the cluster. However, non-thermal X-rays
have not been conclusively detected from any cluster of galaxies so far. In
this paper, for the first time, we model the synchrotron and inverse-Compton
emission of all clusters hosting radio halos and relics for which the spectral
index can be determined. We provide constraints on the volume-average magnetic
field by comparing with current X-ray measurements. We then estimate the
maximum volume-average magnetic field that will allow the detection of
inverse-Compton hard X-rays by the ASTRO-H satellite. We found that several
clusters are good targets for ASTRO-H to detect their inverse-Compton emission,
in particular that corresponding to radio relics, and propose a list of
promising targets for which ASTRO-H can test $\ge1$~$\mu$G magnetic fields. We
conclude that future hard X-ray observations by the already-operating NuSTAR

on the long-sought non-thermal hard-X-ray emission in clusters of galaxies.

continuous-time quantum walks (DTQWs and CTQWs). For classical random walks,
there is a natural sense in which continuous-time walks are a limit of
discrete-time walks. Quantum mechanically, in the discrete-time case, an
additional ""coin space"" must be appended for the walk to have nontrivial time
evolution. Continuous-time quantum walks, however, have no such constraints.
This means that there is no completely straightforward way to treat a CTQW as a
limit of DTQW, as can be done in the classical case. Various approaches to this
problem have been taken in the past. We give a construction for walks on
$d$-regular, $d$-colorable graphs when the coin flip operator is Hermitian:
from a standard DTQW we construct a family of discrete-time walks with a
well-defined continuous-time limit on a related graph. One can think of this
limit as a {\it coined} continuous-time walk. We show that these CTQWs share
some properties with coined DTQWs. In particular, we look at spatial search by
a DTQW over the 2-D torus (a grid with periodic boundary conditions) of size
$\sqrt{N}\times\sqrt{N}$, where it was shown \nocite{AAmbainis08} that a coined
DTQW can search in time $O(\sqrt{N}\log{N})$, but a standard CTQW
\nocite{Childs2004} takes $\Omega(N)$ time to search for a marked element. The
continuous limit of the DTQW search over the 2-D torus exhibits the
$O(\sqrt{N}\log{N})$ scaling, like the coined walk it is derived from. We also
look at the effects of graph symmetry on the limiting walk, and show that the
properties are similar to those of the DTQW as shown in \cite{HariKrovi2007}.

constrain the properties of the core of the progenitor star. We investigate the
dynamics of rapidly rotating core collapse, focusing on hydrodynamic waves
generated by the core bounce and the GW spectrum they produce. The centrifugal
distortion of the rapidly rotating proto-neutron star (PNS) leads to the
generation of axisymmetric quadrupolar oscillations within the PNS and
surrounding envelope. Using linear perturbation theory, we estimate the
frequencies, amplitudes, damping times, and GW spectra of the oscillations. Our
analysis provides a qualitative explanation for several features of the GW
spectrum and shows reasonable agreement with nonlinear hydrodynamic
simulations, although a few discrepancies due to non-linear/rotational effects
are evident. The dominant early postbounce GW signal is produced by the
fundamental quadrupolar oscillation mode of the PNS, at a frequency $0.70 \,
{\rm kHz} \lesssim f \lesssim 0.80\,{\rm kHz}$, whose energy is largely trapped
within the PNS and leaks out on a $\sim\!10$ ms timescale. Quasi-radial
oscillations are not trapped within the PNS and quickly propagate outwards
until they steepen into shocks. Both the PNS structure and Coriolis/centrifugal
forces have a strong impact on the GW spectrum, and a detection of the GW
signal can therefore be used to constrain progenitor properties.

difficult to distinguish from planetary signals. However, even doing the
inference under a given set of simplifying assumptions (e.g. no stellar
activity) can be difficult. It is common for the posterior distribution for the
planet parameters, such as orbital periods, to be multimodal and to have other
awkward features. In addition, when $N$ is unknown, the marginal likelihood (or
evidence) as a function of $N$ is required. Rather than doing separate runs
with different trial values of $N$, we propose an alternative approach using a
trans-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method within Nested Sampling. The
posterior distribution for $N$ can be obtained with a single run. We apply the

normal plane (epsilon^z). Due to this property, finite-thickness slabs of h-BN
act as multimode waveguides for propagation of hyperbolic phonon polaritons -
collective modes that originate from the coupling between photons and electric
dipoles in phonons. However, control of these hyperbolic phonon polaritons
modes has remained challenging, mostly because their electrodynamic properties
are dictated by the crystal lattice of h-BN. Here we show by direct
nano-infrared imaging that these hyperbolic polaritons can be effectively
modulated in a van der Waals heterostructure composed of monolayer graphene on
h-BN. Tunability originates from the hybridization of surface plasmon
polaritons in graphene with hyperbolic phonon polaritons in h-BN, so that the
eigenmodes of the graphene/h-BN heterostructure are hyperbolic plasmon-phonon
polaritons. Remarkably, the hyperbolic plasmon-phonon polaritons in
graphene/h-BN suffer little from ohmic losses, making their propagation length
1.5-2.0 times greater than that of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in h-BN. The
hyperbolic plasmon-phonon polaritons possess the combined virtues of surface
plasmon polaritons in graphene and hyperbolic phonon polaritons in h-BN.
Therefore, graphene/h-BN structures can be classified as electromagnetic
metamaterials since the resulting properties of these devices are not present

taken together with the high cost to upgrade local distribution networks and

voltage networks will be a crucial component of the electric vehicle revolution
and the move away from fossil fuels in transportation. Here, we model the
max-flow and proportional fairness protocols for the control of congestion
caused by a fleet of vehicles charging on two real-world distribution networks.
We show that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition to a congested
state as a function of the rate of vehicles plugging to the network to charge.
We focus on the order parameter and its fluctuations close to the phase
transition, and show that the critical point depends on the choice of
congestion protocol. Finally, we analyse the inequality in the charging times
as the vehicle arrival rate increases, and show that charging times are
considerably more equitable in proportional fairness than in max-flow.

as follows: first suddenly quenching the interatomic interaction from $g_{i}$

interaction from $g_{f}$ back to $g_{i}$, holding the time $t$ sequence $n$

time-to-maturity tends to zero. For this purpose we introduce a new approach to
validate such an expansion, which enables us to treat more general models than
in the literature. The local-stochastic volatility model is treated as well
under an essentially minimal regularity condition in order to show such a
standard model cannot be dynamically consistent to the power law.

photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can be used to directly measure the
momentum-resolved electronic structure of a single wire because of the
difficulty associated with assembling single wire into an ordered array for
such measurements. Here, we demonstrated that the one-dimensional (1D)
confinement of electrons, which are transferred from external dopants, within a
single subnanometre-scale wire (subnanowire) could be directly measured using
ARPES. Convincing evidence of 1D electron confinement was obtained using two
different gold subnanowires with characteristic single metallic bands that were
alternately and spontaneously ordered on a stepped silicon template, Si(553).
Noble metal atoms were adsorbed at room temperature onto the gold subnanowires
while maintaining the overall structure of the wires. Only one type of gold
subnanowires could be controlled using external noble metal dopants without
transforming the metallic band of the other type of gold subnanowires. This
result was confirmed by scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments and
first-principles calculations. The selective control clearly showed that
externally doped electrons could be confined within a single gold subnanowire.
This experimental evidence was used to further investigate the effects of the
disorder induced by external dopants on a single subnanowire using ARPES.

information about the effective interaction, correlations, and properties of
its excited states. To characterize the response, it is useful to use its
energy-weighted moments, or sum rules. By comparing computed sum rules with
experimental values, the information content of the response can be utilized in
the optimization process of the nuclear Hamiltonian or EDF. But the additional
information comes at a price: compared to the ground state, computation of
excited states is more demanding. To establish an efficient framework to
compute sum rules of the response that is adaptable to the optimization of the
nuclear EDF and large-scale surveys of collective strength, we have developed a
new technique within the complex-energy FAM based on the QRPA. To compute sum
rules, we carry out contour integration of the response function in the
complex-energy plane. We benchmark our results against the conventional matrix
formulation of the QRPA theory, the Thouless theorem for the energy-weighted
sum rule, and the dielectric theorem for the inverse energy-weighted sum rule.
We demonstrate that calculated sum-rule values agree with those obtained from
the matrix formulation of the QRPA. We also discuss the applicability of both
the Thouless theorem about the energy-weighted sum rule and the dielectric
theorem for the inverse energy-weighted sum rule to nuclear density functional
theory in cases when the EDF is not based on a Hamiltonian. The proposed
sum-rule technique based on the complex-energy FAM is a tool of choice when
optimizing effective interactions or energy functionals. The method is very
efficient and well-adaptable to parallel computing. The FAM formulation is
especially useful when standard theorems based on commutation relations
involving the nuclear Hamiltonian and external field cannot be used.

swept lasers used in OCT favor the short to long wavelength sweep direction

density-matrix renormalization group method, we calculate momentum distribution
function, gap, and spin-correlation function to reveal rich ground-state
properties. We find that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can generate unconventional
momentum distribution, which depends crucially on the filling. We call the
corresponding phase with zero gap the SOC-induced metallic phase. We also show
that SOC can drive the system from the antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic Mott
insulators with spin rotating. As a result, a second-order quantum phase
transition between the spin-rotating ferromagnetic Mott insulator and the
SOC-induced metallic phase is predicted at the strong SOC. Here the spin
rotating means that the spin orientations of the nearest-neighbor sites are not
parallel or antiparallel, i.e., they have an intersection angle $\theta \in
(0,\pi )$. Finally, we show that the momentum $k_{\mathrm{peak}}$, at which
peak of the spin-structure factor appears, can also be affected dramatically by
SOC. The analytical expression of this momentum with respect to the SOC
strength is also derived. It suggests that the predicted spin-rotating
ferromagnetic ($k_{\mathrm{peak}% }<\pi /2$) and antiferromagnetic ($\pi
/2<k_{\mathrm{peak}}<\pi $) correlations can be detected experimentally by
measuring the SOC-dependent spin-structure factor via the time-of-flight
imaging.

to be affected by a stably stratified layer at the core-mantle boundary. Such a
layer could have an observable signature in both long-term and short-term
variations of the magnetic field of the Earth, which are used to probe the flow
at the top of the core. Indeed, with the recent SWARM mission, it seems
reasonable to be able to identify waves propagating in the core with period of
several months, which may play an important role in the large-scale dynamics.
In this paper, we characterize the influence of a stratified layer at the top
of the core on deep quasi-geostrophic (Rossby) waves. We compute numerically
the quasi-geostrophic eigenmodes of a rapidly rotating spherical shell, with a
stably stratified layer near the outer boundary. Two simple models of
stratification are taken into account, which are scaled with commonly adopted
values of the Brunt-V{\""a}is{\""a}l{\""a} frequency in the Earth's core. In the
absence of magnetic field, we find that both azimuthal wavelength and frequency
of the eigenmodes control their penetration into the stratified layer: the
higher the phase speed, the higher the permeability of the stratified layer to
the wave motion. We also show that the theory developed by Takehiro and Lister
[2001] for thermal convection extends to the whole family of Rossby waves in
the core. Adding a magnetic field, the penetrative behaviour of the
quasi-geostrophic modes (the so-called fast branch) is insensitive to the
imposed magnetic field and only weakly sensitive to the precise shape of the
stratification. Based on these results, the large-scale and high frequency
modes (1 to 2 month periods) may be detectable in the geomagnetic data measured
at the Earth's surface, especially in the equatorial area where the modes can
be trapped.

well-documented high-density, high-ordered propagating bands that emerge in
homogeneous space disappear. Moreover, the ordered phase does not exhibit
long-range order, as occurs in homogeneous systems, but rather quasi-long range
order: i.e. the SPP system becomes disordered in the thermodynamical limit. For
finite size systems, we find that there is an optimal noise value that
maximizes order. Interestingly, the system becomes disordered in two limits,
for high noise values as well as for vanishing noise. This remarkable finding
strongly suggests the existence of two critical points, instead of only one,
associated to the collective motion transition. Density fluctuations are
consistent with these observations, being higher and anomalously strong at the
optimal noise, and decreasing and crossing over to normal for high and low
noise values. Collective properties are investigated in static as well as

theories, including nonrenormalizable ones. We assume that the gauge symmetries
are general covariance, local Lorentz symmetry and Abelian and non-Abelian
Yang-Mills symmetries, and that the local functionals of vanishing ghost number
satisfy a variant of the Kluberg-Stern--Zuber conjecture. We show that if the
gauge anomalies are trivial at one loop, for every truncation of the theory
there exists a subtraction scheme where they manifestly vanish to all orders,
within the truncation. Outside the truncation the cancellation of gauge
anomalies can be enforced by fine-tuning local counterterms. The framework of
the proof is worked out by combining a recently formulated chiral dimensional
regularization with a gauge invariant higher-derivative regularization. If the
higher-derivative regularizing terms are placed well beyond the truncation, and
the energy scale $\Lambda$ associated with them is kept fixed, the theory is
super-renormalizable and has the property that, once the gauge anomalies are
cancelled at one loop, they manifestly vanish from two loops onwards by simple
power counting. When the $\Lambda$ divergences are subtracted away and
$\Lambda$ is sent to infinity, the anomaly cancellation survives in a manifest
form within the truncation and in a nonmanifest form outside. The standard
model coupled to quantum gravity satisfies all the assumptions, so it is free
of gauge anomalies to all orders.

i) a novel method to construct the normal form in cases of resonance, and ii) a
study of the asymptotic behavior of both the non-resonant and the resonant
series. We find that, if we truncate the normal form series at order $r$, the
series remainder in both constructions decreases with increasing $r$ down to a
minimum, and then it increases with $r$. The computed minimum remainder turns
to be exponentially small in $\frac{1}{\Delta E}$, where $\Delta E$ is the
mirror oscillation energy, while the optimal order scales as an inverse power
of $\Delta E$. We estimate numerically the exponents associated with the
optimal order and the remainder's exponential asymptotic behavior. In the
resonant case, our novel method allows to compute a `quasi-integral' (i.e.
truncated formal integral) valid both for each particular resonance as well as
away from all resonances. We applied these results to a specific magnetic
bottle Hamiltonian. The non resonant normal form yields theorerical invariant
curves on a surface of section which fit well the empirical curves away from
resonances. On the other hand the resonant normal form fits very well both the
invariant curves inside the islands of a particular resonance as well as the
non-resonant invariant curves. Finally, we discuss how normal forms allow to

to find replacements. Improving on previous research, we achieve definite

such restrictions are physically adequate. The consequences of the results are
drawn, with respect to both applied and foundational perspectives.

ms time scale, we follow the smooth evolution of the various components. From
this analysis the Band function is globally the most intense component,
although the additional PL can overpower the others in sharp time structures.
The Band function and the BB component are the most intense at early times and
globally fade across the burst duration. The additional PL is the most intense
component at late time and may be correlated with the extended high-energy
emission observed thousands of seconds after the burst with the Fermi/Large
Area Telescope (LAT). Unexpectedly, this analysis also shows that the
additional PL may be present from the very beginning of the burst. We
investigate the effect of the three components on the new time-resolved
luminosity-hardness relation in both the observer and rest frames and show that
a strong correlation exists between the flux of the non-thermal component and
its E$_{peak}$ only when the three components are fitted simultaneously to the
data (i.e., F$_i^{NT}$-E$_{peak,i}^{NT}$ relation). In addition, this result
points toward a universal relation between those two quantities for all GRBs

new IATIs in saturated Group III-Bi bilayers. We show that all these IATIs
preserve extraordinary large bulk band gaps which are well above
room-temperature, allowing for viable applications in room-temperature
spintronic devices. More importantly, most of these systems display large bulk
band gaps that far exceed 0.6 eV and, part of them even are up to ~1 eV, which
are larger than any IATIs ever reported. The nontrivial topological situation
in these systems is confirmed by the identified band inversion of the band
structures and an explicit demonstration of the topological edge states.
Interestingly, the nontrivial band order characteristics are intrinsic to most
of these materials and are not subject to spin-orbit coupling. Owning to their
asymmetric structures, remarkable Rashba spin splitting is produced in both the
valence and conduction bands of these systems. These predictions strongly
revive these new systems as excellent candidates for IATI-based novel
applications.

rate for two-dimensional integral varifolds of locally bounded first variation.
In order to obtain the exact decay rate, a coercive estimate involving a
height-excess quantity measured in Orlicz spaces is established. Moreover,
counter-examples to pointwise power decay rates almost everywhere of the
super-quadratic tilt-excess are obtained. These examples are optimal in terms
of the dimension of the varifold and the exponent of the integrability
condition in most cases, for example if the varifold is not two-dimensional.
These examples also demonstrate that within the scale of Lebesgue spaces no
local higher integrability of the second fundamental form, of an at least
two-dimensional curvature varifold, may be deduced from boundedness of its
generalised mean curvature vector.
  Amongst the tools are Cartesian products of curvature varifolds.

good agreement between the two methods. We also study in detail the effect on

into several well-defined terms: preparation, electrostatic and dispersion
interaction, Pauli repulsion and orbital relaxation energies. The pEDA
presented here for an AO-based implementation can handle restricted and
unrestricted fragments for 0D to 3D systems considering periodic boundary
conditions with and without the determination of fragment occupations. For the
latter case, reciprocal space sampling is enabled. The new method gives
comparable results to established schemes for molecular systems and shows good
convergence with respect to the basis set (TZ2P), the integration accuracy and
k-space sampling. Four typical bonding scenarios for surface adsorbate
complexes were chosen to highlight the performance of the method representing
insulating (CO on MgO(001)), metallic (H$_2$ on M(001), M = Pd, Cu) and
semiconducting (CO and C$_2$H$_2$ on Si(001)c(4x2)) substrates. These examples
cover the regimes of metallic, semiconducting and insulating substrates as well
as bonding scenarios ranging from weakly interacting to covalent (shared
electron and donor acceptor) bonding. The results presented lend confidence,
that the pEDA will be a powerful tool for the analysis of surface-adsorbate
binding in the future, enabling the transfer of concepts like ionic and

from fMRI data is observed to increase during childhood development and peak in
young adulthood. Head motion is deconvolved from the fMRI data, and it is shown
that the dependence of modularity on age is independent of the magnitude of

greater cognitive performance at short times, i.e.\ task switching. A fitness
function is extracted from the model. Quasispecies theory is used to predict
how the average modularity evolves with age, illustrating the increase of

phase space description of triaxial collapse. In this formulation, the
evolution of the triaxial ellipsoid is described in terms of the dynamics of
eigenvalues of three important tensors: the Hessian of the gravitational
potential, the tensor of velocity derivatives and the deformation tensor. The
eigenvalues of the deformation tensor are directly related to the parameters
that describe triaxiality, namely, the minor to major and intermediate to major
axes ratios ($s$ and $q$) and the triaxiality parameter $T$. Using the phase
space equations, we evolve the eigenvalues and examine the evolution of the PDF
(probability distribution function) of the axes ratios as a function of mass
scale and redshift for Gaussian initial conditions. We find that the
ellipticity and prolateness increase with decreasing mass scale and decreasing
redshift. These trends agree with previous analytic studies but differ from
numerical simulations. However, the PDF of the scaled parameter ${\tilde q} =
(q-s)/(1-s)$ follows a universal distribution over two decades in mass range
and redshifts which is in qualitative agreement with the universality for
conditional PDF reported in simulations. We further show using the phase space
dynamics that, in fact, ${\tilde q}$ is a phase space invariant and is
conserved individually for each halo. These results, demonstrate that the phase
space analysis is a useful tool that provides a different perspective on the
evolution of perturbations and can be applied to more sophisticated models in
the future.

the infrared and X-rays, as well as with the astrometry (consistent with a
distances of 11 pc or more and high proper motion as typical for neutron stars)
as well as with non-detection of pulsation (not beamed). We consider the
probability of finding an unrelated object or even a neutron star nearby and
mostly co-aligned in proper motion with Fomalhaut A and come to the conclusion
that this is definitely well possible.

  to Utilization-Based Tests",,,,,"cs.OS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To deal with a large variety of workloads in different application domains in
real-time embedded systems, a number of expressive task models have been
developed. For each individual task model, researchers tend to develop
different types of techniques for deriving schedulability tests with different
computation complexity and performance. In this paper, we present a general
schedulability analysis framework, namely the k2U framework, that can be
potentially applied to analyze a large set of real-time task models under any
fixed-priority scheduling algorithm, on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor
scheduling. The key to k2U is a k-point effective schedulability test, which
can be viewed as a ""blackbox"" interface. For any task model, if a corresponding
k-point effective schedulability test can be constructed, then a sufficient
utilization-based test can be automatically derived. We show the generality of
k2U by applying it to different task models, which results in new and improved
tests compared to the state-of-the-art.
  Analogously, a similar concept by testing only k points with a different
formulation has been studied by us in another framework, called k2Q, which
provides quadratic bounds or utilization bounds based on a different
formulation of schedulability test. With the quadratic and hyperbolic forms,
k2Q and k2U frameworks can be used to provide many quantitive features to be
measured, like the total utilization bounds, speed-up factors, etc., not only
for uniprocessor scheduling but also for multiprocessor scheduling. These
frameworks can be viewed as a ""blackbox"" interface for schedulability tests and
response-time analysis.

well-determined radial velocities and atmospheric parameters. To derive the
LSR, two independent analyses are applied to the data. Firstly, we determine
the solar motion by comparing the observed velocity distribution to that
generated with the analytic formulism of Schonrich & Binney that has been
demonstrated to show excellent agreement with rigorous torus-based dynamics
modelling by Binney & McMillan. Secondly, we propose that cold populations of
thin disc stars, selected by applying an orbital eccentricity cut, can be
directly used to determine the LSR without the need of asymmetric drift
corrections. Both approaches yield consistent results of solar motion in the
direction of Galactic rotation, V_sun, that are much higher than the standard
value adopted hitherto, derived from Stromgren's equation. The newly deduced
values of V_sun are 1-2 km/s smaller than the more recent estimates derived
from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey sample of stars in the solar neighbourhood
(within 100 pc). We attribute the small difference to the presence of several
well-known moving groups in the GCS sample that, fortunately, hardly affect the
LSS-GAC sample. The newly derived radial and vertical components of the solar
motion agree well with the previous studies. In addition, for all components of
the solar motion, the values yielded by stars of different spectral types in
the LSS-GAC sample are consistent with each other, suggesting that the local
disk is well relaxed and that the LSR reported in the current work is robust.
Our final recommended LSR is, (U,V,W)_sun = (7.01+/-0.20, 10.13+/-0.12,

possible influence of the phenomenological description of the unitarity cusp on
the extraction of the normalization of the form factor from data. Using the
scalar form factor of the pion as a theoretical laboratory, we find that this
determination is robust under variations of the phenomenological
parameterizations of the form factor. The second aspect concerns the issue of
radiative corrections. We compute the radiative corrections to the total decay
rate for $K^\pm \to \pi^0 \pi^0 e^\pm \stackrel{_{(-)}}{\nu_e}$ in a setting
that allows comparison with the way radiative corrections were handled in the

once radiative corrections are included, the normalizations of the form factor
as determined experimentally from data in the two decay channels come to a
better agreement. The remaining discrepancy can easily be accounted for by
other isospin-breaking corrections, mainly those due to the difference between
the masses of the up and down quarks.

presented in a streaming fashion. A $\textit{streamed graph}$ is a stream of
edges $e_1,e_2,...,e_m$ on a vertex set $V$. A streamed graph is
$\omega$-$\textit{stream planar}$ with respect to a positive integer window
size $\omega$ if there exists a sequence of planar topological drawings
$\Gamma_i$ of the graphs $G_i=(V,\{e_j \mid i\leq j < i+\omega\})$ such that
the common graph $G^{i}_\cap=G_i\cap G_{i+1}$ is drawn the same in $\Gamma_i$
and in $\Gamma_{i+1}$, for $1\leq i < m-\omega$. The $\textit{Stream
Planarity}$ Problem with window size $\omega$ asks whether a given streamed
graph is $\omega$-stream planar. We also consider a generalization, where there
is an additional $\textit{backbone graph}$ whose edges have to be present
during each time step. These problems are related to several well-studied
planarity problems.
  We show that the $\textit{Stream Planarity}$ Problem is NP-complete even when
the window size is a constant and that the variant with a backbone graph is
NP-complete for all $\omega \ge 2$. On the positive side, we provide
$O(n+\omega{}m)$-time algorithms for (i) the case $\omega = 1$ and (ii) all
values of $\omega$ provided the backbone graph consists of one $2$-connected
component plus isolated vertices and no stream edge connects two isolated
vertices. Our results improve on the Hanani-Tutte-style $O((nm)^3)$-time
algorithm proposed by Schaefer [GD'14] for $\omega=1$.

opens up a new era for high-energy astrophysics. Although there are various
astrophysical candidate sources, a firm association of the detected neutrinos
with one (or more) of them is still lacking. A recent analysis of plausible
astrophysical counterparts within the error circles of IceCube events showed
that likely counterparts for nine of the IceCube neutrinos include mostly BL
Lacs, among which Mrk 421. Motivated by this result and a previous independent
analysis on the neutrino emission from Mrk 421, we test the BL Lac-neutrino
connection in the context of a specific theoretical model for BL Lac emission.
We model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the BL Lacs selected as
counterparts of the IceCube neutrinos using a one-zone leptohadronic model and
mostly nearly simultaneous data. The neutrino flux for each BL Lac is
self-consistently calculated, using photon and proton distributions
specifically derived for every individual source. We find that the SEDs of the
sample, although different in shape and flux, are all well fitted by the model
using reasonable parameter values. Moreover, the model-predicted neutrino flux
and energy for these sources are of the same order of magnitude as those of the
IceCube neutrinos. In two cases, namely Mrk 421 and H 1914-194, we find a
suggestively good agreement between the model prediction and the detected
neutrino flux. Our predictions for all the BL Lacs of the sample are in the
range to be confirmed or disputed by IceCube in the next few years of data
sampling.

remain little understood. Paleomagnetic data primarily constrain the reversal
rate and provide few additional clues. Reversals and excursions are
characterized by a low in dipole moment that can last for some 10kyr. Some
paleomagnetic records also suggest that the field decreases much slower before
an reversals than it recovers afterwards and that the recovery phase may show
an overshoot in field intensity. Here we study the dipole moment variations in
several extremely long dynamo simulation to statistically explored the reversal
and excursion properties. The numerical reversals are characterized by a switch
from a high axial dipole moment state to a low axial dipole moment state. When
analysing the respective transitions we find that decay and growth have very
similar time scales and that there is no overshoot. Other properties are
generally similar to paleomagnetic findings. The dipole moment has to decrease
to about 30% of its mean to allow for reversals. Grand excursions during which
the field intensity drops by a comparable margin are very similar to reversals
and likely have the same internal origin. The simulations suggest that both are
simply triggered by particularly large axial dipole fluctuations while other
field components remain largely unaffected. A model at a particularly large
Ekman number shows a second but little Earth-like type of reversals where the
total field decays and recovers after some time.

range, and Vela detected above 50 GeV, challenges existing models of pulsed

should account for spectral differences among the pulsars.
  We show that the gamma-ray emission of Crab and Vela can be explained by
synchrotron radiation from the current sheet of a striped wind, expanding with
a modest Lorentz factor $\Gamma\lesssim100$ in the Crab case, and
$\Gamma\lesssim50$ in the Vela case. In the Crab spectrum a new synchrotron
self-Compton component is expected to be detected by the upcoming experiment
CTA.
  We suggest that the gamma-ray spectrum directly probes the physics of
relativistic magnetic reconnection in the striped wind. In the most energetic
pulsars, like Crab, with $\dot{E}_{38}^{3/2}/P_{-2}\gtrsim0.002$ (where
$\dot{E}$ is the spin down power, $P$ is the pulsar period, and
$X=X_i\times10^i$ in CGS units), reconnection proceeds in the radiative cooling
regime and results in a soft power-law distribution of cooling particles; in
less powerful pulsars, like Vela, particle energization is limited by the
current sheet size, and a hard particle spectrum reflects the acceleration
mechanism. A strict lower limit on the number density of radiating particles
corresponds to emission close to the light cylinder, and, in units of the GJ
density, it is $\gtrsim0.5$ in the Crab wind, and $\gtrsim0.05$ in the Vela

current can provide a magnetic bias to control the spontaneous symmetry
breaking and select the final magnetization direction of the ferromagnet. Two
proposed methods for achieving the USS configuration are voltage-controlled
Curie temperature (VC-TC) and voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VC-MA).
We believe the development of new 2D magnetic materials with greater tunability
of VC-TC and VC-MA will be needed for practical applications. A successful
realization of spin amplification by controlled symmetry breaking will be
important for the implementation of existing spin-logic proposals (e.g. ""All
Spin Logic"") and could inspire alternative ideas for spintronic circuits and
devices.

metal for the fabrication of superconducting accelerating cavities, should meet
exact specifications. The content of interstitial impurities such as oxygen,
nitrogen, and carbon must be below 10{\mu}g/g. The hydrogen content should be
kept below 2{\mu}g/g to prevent degradation of the Q-value under certain
cool-down conditions. The material should be free of flaws (foreign material
inclusions or cracks and laminations) that can initiate a thermal breakdown.
Defects may be detected by quality control methods such as eddy current
scanning and identified by a number of special methods. Conventional and
alternative cavity fabrication methods are reviewed. Conventionally, niobium
cavities are fabricated from sheet niobium by the formation of half-cells by
deep drawing, followed by trim machining and Electron-Beam Welding (EBW). The
welding of half-cells is a delicate procedure, requiring intermediate cleaning
steps and a careful choice of weld parameters to achieve full penetration of
the joints. The equator welds are particularly critical. A challenge for a
welded construction is the tight mechanical and electrical tolerances. These
can be maintained by a combination of mechanical and radio-frequency
measurements on halfcells and by careful tracking of weld shrinkage. The
established procedure is suitable for large series production. The main aspects
of quality assurance management are mentioned. Another cavity fabrication
approach is slicing discs from the ingot and producing cavities by deep drawing

loss is sufficiently high then substantial amount of volatiles would escape
causing the planet to become uninhabitable. Considering energy-limited
hydrodynamical mass loss with an escape rate that causes oxygen to escape
alongwith hydrogen, I present an upper limit for the ratio between the EUV and
the bolometric luminosities of stars which constrains the habitability of
planets around them. Application of the limit to planet-hosting stars with
known EUV luminosities implies that many M-type of stars should not have
habitable planets around them.

study the ghost propagator of a pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory quantized in the
linear covariant gauges, focusing on its dependence on the gauge-fixing
parameter $\xi$ in the deep infrared. In particular, we first solve the
Schwinger-Dyson equation that governs the dynamics of the ghost propagator,
using a set of simplifying approximations, and under the crucial assumption
that the gluon propagators for $\xi>0$ are infrared finite, as is the case in
the Landau gauge $(\xi=0)$. Then we appeal to the Nielsen identities, and
express the derivative of the ghost propagator with respect to $\xi$ in terms
of certain auxiliary Green's functions, which are subsequently computed under
the same assumptions as before. Within both formalisms we find that for $\xi>0$
the ghost dressing function approaches zero in the deep infrared, in sharp
contrast to what happens in the Landau gauge, where it known to saturate at a
finite (non-vanishing) value. The Nielsen identities are then extended to the
case of the gluon propagator, and the $\xi$-dependence of the corresponding
gluon masses is derived using as input the results obtained in the previous
steps. The result turns out to be logarithmically divergent in the deep
infrared; the compatibility of this behavior with the basic assumption of a
finite gluon propagator is discussed, and a specific Ansatz is put forth, which
readily reconciles both features.

They provide polytopal realizations of the nested complex of a graph $G$,
defined as the simplicial complex whose vertices are the tubes (i.e. connected
induced subgraphs) of $G$ and whose faces are the tubings (i.e. collections of
pairwise nested or non-adjacent tubes) of $G$. The constructions of M. Carr and
S. Devadoss, of A. Postnikov, and of A. Zelevinsky for graph associahedra are
all based on the nested fan which coarsens the normal fan of the permutahedron.
In view of the combinatorial and geometric variety of simplicial fan
realizations of the classical associahedra, it is tempting to search for
alternative fans realizing graphical nested complexes.
  Motivated by the analogy between finite type cluster complexes and graphical
nested complexes, we transpose in this paper S. Fomin and A. Zelevinsky's
construction of compatibility fans from the former to the latter setting. For
this, we define a compatibility degree between two tubes of a graph $G$. Our
main result asserts that the compatibility vectors of all tubes of $G$ with
respect to an arbitrary maximal tubing on $G$ support a complete simplicial fan
realizing the nested complex of $G$. In particular, when the graph $G$ is
reduced to a path, our compatibility degree lies in $\{-1,0,1\}$ and we recover
F. Santos' Catalan many simplicial fan realizations of the associahedron.

magnetization of wires of various shapes (circular, elliptical, plate) in an

penetration means that the field produced by the superconducting magnet is no
longer proportional to the supplied current. It also leads to a dissipation of
electromagnetic energy. In conductors with unequal transverse dimensions, such
as flat cables, the orientation with respect to the magnetic field plays an
essential role. A reduction of magnetization currents can be achieved by
splitting the core of a superconducting wire into fine filaments; however, new
kinds of electrical currents that couple the filaments consequently appear.

concentrations of elementary point defects and to determine site preferences of
solute atoms in ordered alloys. Combinations of lattice vacancies, antisite
atoms and host interstitials that form equilibrium defects are enumerated for
the CsCl (B2) and Ni2Al3 structures. For CsCl, in addition to the two
substitutional sites, a distorted tetrahedral interstitial site is considered.
For Ni2Al3, the Ni site, two distinct Al sites and a vacant, insterstitial-type
Ni-site are considered. An equation of constraint among concentrations of
elementary defects is derived that is valid for any crystal structure. The
concentration of a selected defect can be solved using the equation of
constraint in conjunction with mass-action equations for defect combinations.
The method leads directly to defect concentrations without the need to evaluate
composition-dependent chemical potentials, resulting in a more transparent
formalism.
  The model is used to explore the phenomenology of site-preferences of dilute
ternary solute atoms. Findings are in agreement with previous treatments
restricted to substitutional sites. General rules for how site-preferences
depend on temperature and on composition in non-stoichiometric compounds are
obtained through algebraic analysis and numerical simulations: (1) Solute S
tends to occupy substitutional sites of the element in which there is a
deficiency. (2) If the difference of energies of S on sites A and B is very
positive or negative, then S will occupy site B or A exclusively, independent
of composition. If the difference of site energies is intermediate, the solute
will switch from one site to the other as the composition changes. (3) Solutes
have a tendency to occupy interstitial or empty-lattice sites with a maximum
site-fraction near the stoichiometric composition.

perturbation theory for approximate solutions to this non-equilibrium
condensate model and compare the results with numerically calculated solutions
for both repulsive and attractive polariton-polariton interactions. While the
nonlinearity has a weak effect on the mode selection their density profiles are
modified at moderate gain strengths and becomes more dominant when a very large
gain of polaritons implies an extended cloud with high condensate densities.
Finally, we identify the relation of the observed patterns to the input pump
configuration, and suggest this may serve as a generalized NOR gate in the
tradition of optical computing.

professional lives of a huge segment of the population, with direct
consequences to offline activities. Built on a foundation of trust-users
connect to other users with common interests or overlapping personal
trajectories-online social networks and the associated applications extract an
unprecedented volume of personal information. Unsurprisingly, serious privacy
and security risks emerged, positioning themselves along two main types of
attacks: attacks that exploit the implicit trust embedded in declared social
relationships; and attacks that harvest user's personal information for
ill-intended use. This article provides an overview of the privacy and security
issues that emerged so far in OSNs. We introduce a taxonomy of privacy and
security attacks in OSNs, we overview existing solutions to mitigate those
attacks, and outline challenges still to overcome.

photoelectrons in p+-GaAs is studied as a function of lattice and electron
temperature. The charge and spin mobilities of photoelectrons are equal in all
conditions and exhibit the well known increase as the temperature is lowered.
It is shown that this is related mainly to the electron statistics rather than
the majority hole statistics. This finding suggests that current theoretical
models based on degeneracy of majority carriers cannot fully explain the
observed temperature dependence of minority carrier mobility.
