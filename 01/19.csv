when a jet impinges on a free surface. This effect is observed when the fluid
is Newtonian and the jet falls in a bath undergoing a solid motion. It occurs
also for non-Newtonian fluids when the jets falls in a vessel at rest
containing the same fluid.
  We investigate numerically the impact of the experimental setting and the
rheological properties of the fluid on the onset of the bouncing phenomenon.
Our investigations show that the occurrence of a thin lubricating layer of air
separating the jet and the rest of the liquid is a key factor for the bouncing
of the jet to happen.
  The numerical technique that is used consists of a projection method for the
Navier-Stokes system coupled with a level set formulation for the
representation of the interface. The space approximation is done with adaptive
finite elements. Adaptive refinement is shown to be very important to capture
the thin layer of air that is responsible for the bouncing.

and 10^46 erg/s and redshifts from 0.05 to 2.8. The rest-frame 6 {\mu}m
luminosities were computed using data from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey

consistent with being linear, L_6 {\mu}m $\propto$ L_2-10 keV^0.99$\pm$0.032,
with intrinsic scatter, ~0.35 dex in log L_6 {\mu}m. The L_6 {\mu}m/L_2-10 keV
luminosity ratio is largely independent on the line-of-sight X-ray absorption.
Assuming a constant X-ray bolometric correction, the fraction of AGN bolometric
luminosity reprocessed in the mid-IR decreases weakly, if at all, with the AGN
luminosity, a finding at odds with simple receding torus models. Type 2 AGN
have redder mid-IR continua at rest-frame wavelengths <12 {\mu}m and are
overall ~1.3-2 times fainter at 6 {\mu}m than type 1 AGN at a given X-ray
luminosity. Regardless of whether type 1 and type 2 AGN have the same or
different nuclear dusty toroidal structures, our results imply that the AGN
emission at rest-frame 6 {\mu}m is not isotropic due to self-absorption in the

  The purpose of the present work is to determine the theoretical bolometer
spectrum with two hole excitations more reliably directly in holmium and

complicate more the determination of the neutrino mass compared to the
situation with one-hole states only. At the Q value the highest one-hole
resonance is dominant. Under the assumption of a Lorentzian line shape one has
to fit after inclusion of the experimental spectral function of the detector
four quantities to the data: (1) The neutrino mass, (2) the energy distance of
the dominant resonance to the Q value, (3) the line witdth and (4) the strength
of the resonance. Compared to Robertson this work includes major improvements
and it shows, that a determination of the neutrino mass is difficult but not
impossible.

trace from cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization are dependent on the
spectral radiance, abundance and distribution of the first bound systems of
stars and early galaxies, which govern the evolution in the spin-flip level
populations. Redshifted 21 cm from these epochs when the spin temperature
deviates from the temperature of the ambient relic cosmic microwave background
results in an all-sky spectral structure in the 40-200 MHz range, almost wholly
within the band of SKA-Low. Another spectral structure from gas evolution is
redshifted recombination lines from epoch of recombination of hydrogen and
helium; the weak all-sky spectral structure arising from this event is best
detected at the upper end of the 350-3050 MHz band of SKA-mid. Total power
spectra of SKA interferometer elements form the measurement set for these faint
signals from recombination and reionization; the inter-element interferometer
visibilities form a calibration set. The challenge is in precision polarimetric
calibration of the element spectral response and solving for additives and
unwanted confusing leakages of sky angular structure modes into spectral modes.
Herein we discuss observing methods and design requirements that make possible
these all-sky SKA measurements of the cosmic evolution of hydrogen.

generalizing two-level qubit systems to odd prime d-level qudit systems. While
state-independent contextuality using two-qubit states does not generalize to

mathematical questions that figure prominently in STEM (science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics) courses. Our data-driven framework for
mathematical language processing (MLP) leverages solution data from a large
number of learners to evaluate the correctness of their solutions, assign
partial-credit scores, and provide feedback to each learner on the likely
locations of any errors. MLP takes inspiration from the success of natural
language processing for text data and comprises three main steps. First, we
convert each solution to an open response mathematical question into a series
of numerical features. Second, we cluster the features from several solutions
to uncover the structures of correct, partially correct, and incorrect
solutions. We develop two different clustering approaches, one that leverages
generic clustering algorithms and one based on Bayesian nonparametrics. Third,
we automatically grade the remaining (potentially large number of) solutions
based on their assigned cluster and one instructor-provided grade per cluster.
As a bonus, we can track the cluster assignment of each step of a multistep
solution and determine when it departs from a cluster of correct solutions,
which enables us to indicate the likely locations of errors to learners. We
test and validate MLP on real-world MOOC data to demonstrate how it can
substantially reduce the human effort required in large-scale educational
platforms.

interactions between networks, ranging from predator-prey networks to networks

damage a target network, it also curtails the ability of the attacker, which
must choose the duration and magnitude of an attack to avoid negative impacts
on its own functioning. Nevertheless, despite the large number of studies on
interconnected networks, the consequences of initiating an attack have never
been studied. Here, we address this issue by introducing a model of network
competition where a resilient network is willing to partially weaken its own
resilience in order to more severely damage a less resilient competitor. The
attacking network can take over the competitor nodes after their long
inactivity. However, due to a feedback mechanism the takeovers weaken the
resilience of the attacking network. We define a conservation law that relates
the feedback mechanism to the resilience dynamics for two competing networks.
Within this formalism, we determine the cost and optimal duration of an attack,
allowing a network to evaluate the risk of initiating hostilities.

suffer before it breaks. Materials with high mechanical stretchability, which
can reversibly withstand extreme mechanical deformation and cover arbitrary
surfaces and movable parts, are used for stretchable display devices, broadband
photonic tuning and aberration-free optical imaging. Strain can be utilised to
control the band structures of materials and can even be utilised to induce a
topological phase transition, driving the normal insulators to topological
non-trivial materials with non-zero Chern number or Z2 number. Here, we propose
a new two-dimensional topological material with ultra-high mechanical
stretchability - the ditch-like 2D arsenic. This new anisotropic material
possesses a large Poisson's ratio 1.049, which is larger than any other
reported inorganic materials and has a ultra-high stretchability 44% along the
armchair direction, which is unprecedent in inorganic materials as far as we
know. Its minimum bend radius of this material can be as low as 0.66 nm, which
is comparable to the radius of carbon-nanotube. Such mechanical properties make
this new material be a stretchable semiconductor which could be used to
construct flexible display devices and stretchable sensors. Axial strain will
make a conspicuous affect on the band structure of the system, and a proper
strain along the zigzag direction will drive the 2D arsenic into the
topological insulator in which the topological edge state can host
dissipation-less spin current and spin transfer toque, which are useful in
spintronics devices such as dissipation transistor, interconnect channels and
spin valve devices.

Ion Cyclotron Heating scenarios. Moreover, the EDFs can also represent nearly
isotropic equilibria for Slowing-Down $alpha$ particles and core thermal plasma
populations. These EDFs depend on constants of motion (COMs). Assuming an
axisymmetric system with no equilibrium electric field, the EDF depends on the
toroidal canonical momentum $P_\phi$, the kinetic energy $w$ and the magnetic
moment \mu. In the present work, the EDFs are obtained from first principles
and general hypothesis. The derivation is probabilistic and makes use of the
Bayes' Theorem.
  The bayesian argument allows us to describe how far from the prior
probability distribution function (pdf), e.g. Maxwellian, the plasma is, based
on the information obtained from magnetic moment and GC velocity pdf.
  Once the general functional form of the EDF has been settled, it is shown how
to associate a Landau collision operator and a Fokker-Planck equation that

motion. Among all solutions, two are particularly important: guiding particle
and gyro-particle solutions. The guiding particle has been characterized to be
minimally coupled to the magnetic field, the gyro-particle has been defined to
be maximally coupled to the magnetic field and, also, to move on a closed
orbit. The generic charged particle motion is shown to be expressed as the sum
of such particular solutions. This non perturbative approach corresponds to the
description of the particle motion in the gyro-center and/or guiding center

experienced by the conduction electrons. The inflow and outflow of this field
across a closed surface is not necessarily equal, thus it allows for the
existence of emergent monopoles. One example is a segment of skyrmion line
inside a crystal, where a monopole and antimonopole pair is connected by the
emergent magnetic flux line. This is a realization of Dirac string-like
excitations. Here we study the dynamics of monopoles in chiral magnets under an
electric current. We show that in the process of creation of skyrmion lines,
skyrmion line segments are first created via the proliferation of monopoles and
antimonopoles. Then these line segments join and span the whole system through
the annihilation of monopoles. The skyrmion lines are destroyed via the
proliferation of monopoles and antimonopoles at high currents, resulting in a
chiral liquid phase. We also propose to create the monopoles in a controlled
way by applying an inhomogenous current to a crystal. Remarkably, an electric
field component in the magnetic field direction proportional to the current
squared in the low current region is induced by the motion of distorted
skyrmion lines, in addition to the Hall and longitudinal voltage. The existence
of monopoles can be inferred from transport or imaging measurements.

this intuition is valid, I examined an artificial organism -- a simple robot --
that learned to navigate in an arena and analyzed the entropy of the outcome
variables action, state, and reward. Entropy did indeed decrease in the initial
stages of learning, but two factors complicated the scenario: (1) the
introduction of new options discovered during the learning process and (2) the
shifting patterns of perceptual and environmental states resulting from changes
to the robot's learned movement strategies. These factors lead to a subsequent

exit time distributions from regions or transition time distributions between

problem over the past thirty years. Primary measures of transport for
volume-preserving maps include the exiting and incoming fluxes to a region. For
area-preserving maps, transport is impeded by curves formed from invariant
manifolds that form partial barriers, e.g., stable and unstable manifolds
bounding a resonance zone or cantori, the remnants of destroyed invariant tori.
When the map is exact volume preserving, a Lagrangian differential form can be
used to reduce the computation of fluxes to finding a difference between the
action of certain key orbits, such as homoclinic orbits to a saddle or to a
cantorus. Given a partition of phase space into regions bounded by partial
barriers, a Markov tree model of transport explains key observations, such as
the algebraic decay of exit and recurrence distributions.

near the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most
tightly-bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make the
characteristic radius comparable to the semi-major axis of the most-bound
material, not the tidal radius as previously thought. The outer shocks are
caused by post-Newtonian effects, both on the stellar orbit during its
disruption and on the tidal forces. Accumulation of mass into the accretion
flow is non-monotonic and slow, requiring ~3--10x the orbital period of the
most tightly-bound tidal streams, while the inflow time for most of the mass
may be comparable to or longer than the mass accumulation time. Deflection by
shocks does, however, remove enough angular momentum and energy from some mass
for it to move inward even before most of the mass is accumulated into the
accretion flow. Although the accretion rate rises sharply and then decays
roughly as a power-law, its maximum is ~0.1x the previous expectation, and the
duration of the peak is ~5x longer than previously predicted. The geometric
mean of the black hole mass and stellar mass inferred from a measured event

etc., often results in large amounts of video data, resulting in significant
challenges for inference in terms of storage, communication and computation.
Compressive cameras have emerged as a potential solution to deal with the data
deluge issues in such applications. However, inference tasks such as action
recognition require high quality features which implies reconstructing the
original video data. Much work in compressive sensing (CS) theory is geared
towards solving the reconstruction problem, where state-of-the-art methods are
computationally intensive and provide low-quality results at high compression
rates. Thus, reconstruction-free methods for inference are much desired. In
this paper, we propose reconstruction-free methods for action recognition from
compressive cameras at high compression ratios of 100 and above. Recognizing
actions directly from CS measurements requires features which are mostly
nonlinear and thus not easily applicable. This leads us to search for such
properties that are preserved in compressive measurements. To this end, we
propose the use of spatio-temporal smashed filters, which are compressive
domain versions of pixel-domain matched filters. We conduct experiments on
publicly available databases and show that one can obtain recognition rates
that are comparable to the oracle method in uncompressed setup, even for high
compression ratios.

elements of this expansion are invariant to permutation of their suffices and
relate higher order mutual informations to lower order ones. The third order
difference is expressible as an, apparently assymmetric, difference between a
marginal and a conditional mutual information. Its role in the decomposition
for explained information provides a technical definition for synergy between
three random variables. Positive values occur when two variables provide
alternative explanations for a third; negative values, termed synergies, occur
when the sum of explained information is greater than the sum of its parts.
Synergies tend to be infrequent; they connect the seemingly unrelated concepts
of suppressor variables in regression, on the one hand, and unshielded
colliders in Bayes networks (immoralities), on the other. We give novel
characterizations of these phenomena that generalise to categorical variables

unitarity of S-matrix in the same framework. The Kaluza-Klein(KK) gauge bosons,
KK scalars and KK fermions in the GHU models can drastically change the strong
gravity scale and the unitarity violation scale. In particular we consider two
models GHU_SM and GHU_MSSM which have the zero modes corresponding to the
particle content of the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model, respectively. We find that the strong gravity scale could be lowered as
much as 10^13 (10^14) GeV in the GHU_SM (GHU_MSSM) for one extra dimension
taking 1 TeV as the compactification scale. It is also shown that these scales
are proportional to the inverse of the number of extra dimensions d. In the
d=10 case, they could be lowered up to 10^5 GeV for both models. We also find
that the maximum compactification scales of extra dimensions quickly converge
into one special scale M_O near Planck scale or equivalently into one common
radius R_0 irrespectively of d as the number of zero modes increases. It may
mean that all extra dimensions emerge with the same radius near Planck scale.
In addition, it is shown that the supersymmetry can help to remove the
discordance between the strong gravity scale and the unitarity violation scale.

the formation time, defined as the time when the virial mass of the main
progenitor equals the mass enclosed within the scale radius, correlates
strongly with concentration. We provide a semi-analytic model for halo mass
history that combines analytic relations with fits to simulations. This model
has the functional form, $M(z) = M_{0}(1+z)^{\alpha}e^{\beta z}$, where the
parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are directly correlated with concentration. We
then combine this model for the halo mass history with the analytic relations
between $\alpha$, $\beta$ and the linear power spectrum derived by Correa et
al. (2014) to establish the physical link between halo concentration and the
initial density perturbation field. Finally, we provide fitting formulas for
the halo mass history as well as numerical routines, we derive the accretion
rate as a function of halo mass, and we demonstrate how the halo mass history

assignment, though not randomized by the investigator, is plausibly close to
random. A process that assigns treatments in a highly nonrandom, inequitable
manner may, in rare and brief moments, assign aspects of treatments at random
or nearly so. Isolating those moments and aspects may extract a natural
experiment from a setting in which treatment assignment is otherwise quite
biased, far from random. Isolation is a tool that focuses on those rare, brief
instances, extracting a small natural experiment from otherwise useless data.
We discuss the theory behind isolation and illustrate its use in a reanalysis
of a well-known study of the effects of fertility on workforce participation.
Whether a woman becomes pregnant at a certain moment in her life and whether
she brings that pregnancy to term may reflect her aspirations for family,
education and career, the degree of control she exerts over her fertility, and
the quality of her relationship with the father; moreover, these aspirations
and relationships are unlikely to be recorded with precision in surveys and
censuses, and they may confound studies of workforce participation. However,
given that a women is pregnant and will bring the pregnancy to term, whether
she will have twins or a single child is, to a large extent, simply luck. Given
that a woman is pregnant at a certain moment, the differential comparison of
two types of pregnancies on workforce participation, twins or a single child,
may be close to randomized, not biased by unmeasured aspirations. In this
comparison, we find in our case study that mothers of twins had more children
but only slightly reduced workforce participation, approximately 5% less time
at work for an additional child.

offer opportunities to study the details of the pc-scale radio sources as well
as the environments that the radio sources inhabit, across the electromagnetic
spectrum. Given that some models for the origin and evolution of GPS radio
sources require a strong connection between the radio source morphology and the
gaseous nuclear environment, such opportunities for detailed study are
important. Our VLBI images of PKS 2254-367 show that the previously identified
similarities between IC 1459 and NGC 1052 continue onto the pc-scale. Both
compact radio sources appear to have symmetric jets of approximately the same
luminosity, much lower than typically noted in compact double GPS sources.
Similarities between PKS 2254-367 and NGC 1052, and differences with respect to
other GPS galaxies, lead us to speculate that a sub-class of GPS radio sources,
with low luminosity and with jet-dominated morphologies, exists and would be
largely absent from radio source surveys with ~1 Jy flux density cutoffs. We
suggest that this possible low-luminosity, jet-dominated population of GPS

luminosity lobe-dominated GPS sources being the analog of the FR-II radio
galaxies.

in an optimal valid coloring gives the writing capacity of a given state
transition graph. The subDP problems are computationally hard; it is proved to
be NP-complete in this paper. One of our main contributions in this paper is to
show the asymptotic behavior of the writing capacity $C(G)$ for sequences of
dense bidirectional graphs, that is given by C(G)=Omega(n/ln n) where n is the
number of nodes. A probabilistic method called Lovasz local lemma (LLL) plays
an essential role to derive the asymptotic expression.

magnetized plasma slab are investigated in this work. The waves are affected by
the nonideal magnetohydrodynamic effects which causes finite drift of the
magnetic field in the medium. When the magnetic field drift is ignored, the
characteristics of the wave propagation in a partially ionized plasma fluid is
similar to the fully ionized ideal MHD except now the propagation properties
depend on the fractional ionization as well as on the compressibility of the
medium. The phase velocity of the sausage and kink waves increases marginally
(by a few percent) due to the compressibility of the medium in both ideal as
well as Hall diffusion dominated regimes. However, unlike ideal regime, only
waves below certain cut off frequency can propagate in the medium in Hall
dominated regime. This cut off for a thin slab has a weak dependence on the
plasma beta whereas for thick slab no such dependence exists. More importantly,
since the cut off is introduced by the Hall diffusion, the fractional
ionization of the medium is more important than the plasma compressibility in
determining such a cut off. We discuss the relevance of these results in the
context of solar photosphere-chromosphere.

the development of highly integrated photonic circuits where controlling light
at the nanoscale becomes the most critical aspect of information transfer .
Directional couplers, two interacting optical waveguides placed in close
proximity, are important building blocks in these integrated photonics circuits
and have been employed as optical modulators and switches for high speed
communication, data processing and integrated quantum operations. However,
active control over the coupling between closely packed waveguides is highly
desirable and yet remains a critical barrier towards ultra small footprint
devices. A general approach to achieve active control in waveguide systems is
to exploit optical nonlinearities enabled by a strong control pulse. However
these devices suffer from the nonlinear absorption induced by the intense
control pulse as the signal and its control propagate in the same waveguide.
Here we experimentally demonstrate a unique scheme based on adiabatic
elimination (AE) concept that effectively manipulates the coupling between
densely packed waveguides. We demonstrate active coupling control between two
closely packed waveguides by tuning the mode index of an in-between decoupled
waveguide. This is achieved via a dark mode and thus leaves the signal
unaffected by the induced losses. Such a scheme is a promising candidate for
ultra-dense integrated nano-photonics such as on-chip ultrafast modulators and
tunable filters for optical communication and quantum computing.

simultaneously has become routine in biomedical research during the past
decade. A tremendous amount of expression profiles are generated and stored in
the public domain and information integration by meta-analysis to detect
differentially expressed (DE) genes has become popular to obtain increased
statistical power and validated findings. Methods that aggregate transformed
$p$-value evidence have been widely used in genomic settings, among which
Fisher's and Stouffer's methods are the most popular ones. In practice, raw
data and $p$-values of DE evidence are often not available in genomic studies
that are to be combined. Instead, only the detected DE gene lists under a
certain $p$-value threshold (e.g., DE genes with $p$-value${}<0.001$) are
reported in journal publications. The truncated $p$-value information makes the
aforementioned meta-analysis methods inapplicable and researchers are forced to
apply a less efficient vote counting method or na\""{i}vely drop the studies
with incomplete information. The purpose of this paper is to develop effective
meta-analysis methods for such situations with partially censored $p$-values.
We developed and compared three imputation methods - mean imputation, single
random imputation and multiple imputation - for a general class of evidence
aggregation methods of which Fisher's and Stouffer's methods are special
examples. The null distribution of each method was analytically derived and
subsequent inference and genomic analysis frameworks were established.
Simulations were performed to investigate the type I error, power and the
control of false discovery rate (FDR) for (correlated) gene expression data.
The proposed methods were applied to several genomic applications in colorectal
cancer, pain and liquid association analysis of major depressive disorder
(MDD). The results showed that imputation methods outperformed existing
na\""{i}ve approaches. Mean imputation and multiple imputation methods performed
the best and are recommended for future applications.

Mars. In this work, a 1-D Monte-Carlo Model is developed to calculate escape
rates of energetic oxygen atoms produced from O2+ dissociative recombination
reactions (DR) under 1, 3, 10, and 20 times present solar XUV fluxes. We found
that although the overall DR rates increase with solar XUV flux almost
linearly, oxygen escape rate increases from 1 to 10 times present solar XUV
conditions but decreases when increasing solar XUV flux further. Analysis shows
that atomic species in the upper thermosphere of early Mars increases more
rapidly than O2+ when increasing XUV fluxes. While the latter is the source of
energetic O atoms, the former increases the collision probability and thus
decreases the escape probability of energetic O. Our results suggest that
photochemical escape be a less important escape mechanism than previously
thought for the loss of water and/or CO2 from early Mars.

Dawn and Epoch of Reionization (CD/EoR) in unprecedented detail, both
spectrally and spatially. This wealth of information is buried under Galactic
and extragalactic foregrounds, which must be removed accurately and precisely
in order to reveal the cosmological signal. This problem has been addressed
already for the previous generation of radio telescopes, but the application to
SKA is different in many aspects.
  In this chapter we summarise the contributions to the field of foreground
removal in the context of high redshift and high sensitivity 21-cm
measurements. We use a state-of-the-art simulation of the SKA Phase 1
observations complete with cosmological signal, foregrounds and
frequency-dependent instrumental effects to test both parametric and
non-parametric foreground removal methods. We compare the recovered
cosmological signal using several different statistics and explore one of the
most exciting possibilities with the SKA --- imaging of the ionized bubbles.
  We find that with current methods it is possible to remove the foregrounds
with great accuracy and to get impressive power spectra and images of the
cosmological signal. The frequency-dependent PSF of the instrument complicates
this recovery, so we resort to splitting the observation bandwidth into smaller
segments, each of a common resolution.
  If the foregrounds are allowed a random variation from the smooth power law
along the line of sight, methods exploiting the smoothness of foregrounds or a
parametrization of their behaviour are challenged much more than non-parametric
ones. However, we show that correction techniques can be implemented to restore
the performances of parametric approaches, as long as the first-order
approximation of a power law stands.

resolved utilizing a low-order Taylor expansion of the density. Both
evaluations can be accelerated by fast Fourier transforms (FFT). The new method

extremely red broad band colours and remain undetected in emission lines after
optical `discovery' spectroscopy. In this paper we present deep GTC optical
imaging and spectroscopy of one such radio galaxy, 5C 7.245, with the aim of
better understanding the nature of these enigmatic objects. Our g-band image
shows no significant emission coincident with the stellar emission of the host
galaxy, but does reveal faint emission offset by ~3"" (26 kpc) therefrom along a
similar position angle to that of the radio jets, reminiscent of the `alignment
effect' often seen in the optically luminous HzRGs. This offset g-band source
is also detected in several UV emission lines, giving it a redshift of 1.609,
with emission line flux ratios inconsistent with photoionization by young stars
or an AGN, but consistent with ionization by fast shocks. Based on its unusual
gas geometry, we argue that in 5C 7.245 we are witnessing a rare (or rarely
observed) phase in the evolution of quasar hosts when stellar mass assembly,
accretion onto the back hole, and powerful feedback activity has eradicated its
cold gas from the central ~20 kpc, but is still in the process of cleansing
cold gas from its extended halo.

significantly improve Krylov solver convergence rates for the Helmholtz problem

extended LM models by including individual covariates and by formulating a
mixed approach to take into account additional dependence structures in the

to fit different types of longitudinal data. Model parameters are estimated
through the expectation-maximization algorithm, based on the forward-backward

visibility consists of many discrete spikes within a limited range of delays.
On short baselines it consists of a sharp spike surrounded by lower spikes. The
average envelope of correlations of the visibility function show two
exponential scales, with characteristic delays of $\tau_1=4.1\pm 0.3\ \mu{\rm
s}$ and $\tau_2=23\pm 3\ \mu{\rm s}$, indicating the presence of two scales of
scattering in the interstellar medium. These two scales are present in the

power of the shorter one. We suggest that the longer tail arises from
highly-scattered paths, possibly from anisotropic scattering or from
substructure at large angles.

Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey in the fields of young clusters whose
population includes pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. Both methods that have been
extensively used in the past and new ones developed in the contest of the
Gaia-ESO survey enterprise are available and used. The internal precision of
these quantities is estimated by inter-comparing the results obtained by such
different methods, while the accuracy is estimated by comparison with
independent external data, like effective temperature and surface gravity
derived from angular diameter measurements, on a sample of benchmarks stars.
Specific strategies are implemented to deal with fast rotation, accretion
signatures, chromospheric activity, and veiling. The analysis carried out on
spectra acquired in young clusters' fields during the first 18 months of
observations, up to June 2013, is presented in preparation of the first release
of advanced data products. Stellar parameters obtained with the higher
resolution and larger wavelength coverage from UVES are reproduced with
comparable accuracy and precision using the smaller wavelength range and lower
resolution of the GIRAFFE setup adopted for young stars, which allows us to
provide with confidence stellar parameters for the much larger GIRAFFE sample.
Precisions are estimated to be $\approx$ 120 K r.m.s. in Teff, $\approx$0.3 dex
r.m.s. in logg, and $\approx$0.15 dex r.m.s. in [Fe/H], for both the UVES and

Gaussian noise. BHT-BP has a joint detection-and-estimation structure
consisting of a sparse support detector and a nonzero estimator. The support
detector is designed under the criterion of the minimum detection error
probability using a nonparametric belief propagation (nBP) and composite binary
hypothesis tests. The nonzeros are estimated in the sense of linear MMSE, where
the support detection result is utilized. BHT-BP has its strength in noise
robust support detection, effectively removing quantization errors caused by
the uniform sampling-based nBP. Therefore, in the NSR problems, BHT-BP has
advantages over CS-BP which is an existing nBP algorithm, being comparable to
other recent CS solvers, in several aspects. In addition, we examine impact of
the minimum nonzero value of sparse signals via BHT-BP, on the basis of the
results of the recent literature. Our empirical result shows that variation of
x_min is reflected to recovery performance in the form of SNR shift.

agents through strategic intermediaries (or mediators), and investigate the
cost to society due to the mediators' strategic behavior. Selfish agents with
private information are each associated with exactly one strategic mediator,
and can interact with the mechanism exclusively through that mediator. Each
mediator aims to optimize the combined utility of his agents, while the
mechanism aims to optimize the combined utility of all agents. We focus on the
problem of facility location on a metric induced by a publicly known tree. With
non-strategic mediators, there is a dominant strategy mechanism that is
optimal. We show that when both agents and mediators act strategically, there
is no dominant strategy mechanism that achieves any approximation. We, thus,
slightly relax the incentive constraints, and define the notion of a two-sided
incentive compatible mechanism. We show that the $3$-competitive deterministic
mechanism suggested by Procaccia and Tennenholtz (2013) and Dekel et al. (2010)
for lines extends naturally to trees, and is still $3$-competitive as well as
two-sided incentive compatible. This is essentially the best possible. We then
show that by allowing randomization one can construct a $2$-competitive
randomized mechanism that is two-sided incentive compatible, and this is also
essentially tight. This result also closes a gap left in the work of Procaccia
and Tennenholtz (2013) and Lu et al. (2009) for the simpler problem of
designing strategy-proof mechanisms for weighted agents with no mediators on a
line, while extending to the more general model of trees. We also investigate a
further generalization of the above setting where there are multiple levels of
mediators.

of three pairs of tetrahedra packings prepared with three different tapping
protocols. The packings in each pair differs in the number of mechanical
constraints $C$ imposed on the particles by their contacts, while their bulk
volume fraction $\phi_{global}$ is approximately the same. We decompose $C$
into the contributions of the three different contact types possible between
tetrahedra -- face-to-face (F2F), edge-to-face (E2F), and point contacts --
which each fix a different amount of constraints. We then perform a local
analysis of the contact distribution by grouping the particles together
according to their individual volume fraction $\phi_{local}$ computed from a
Voronoi tessellation. We find that in samples which have been tapped
sufficiently long the number of F2F contacts becomes an universal function of
$\phi_{local}$. In contrast the number of E2F and point contacts varies with
the applied tapping protocol. Moreover, we find that the anisotropy of the
shape of the Voronoi cells depends on the tapping protocol. This behavior
differs from spheres and ellipsoids and posses a significant constraint for any

gauged B-L extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a classical conformality.
We examine whether the scalar couplings and their beta functions can become
simultaneously zero at $\Lambda_{\text{MPP}}:=10^{17}$ GeV by using the
two-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs). We find that we can actually
realize such a situation and that the parameters of the model are uniquely
determined by the MPP. However, as discussed in \cite{Iso:2012jn}, if we want
to realize the electroweak symmetry breaking by the radiative B-L symmetry
breaking, the self coupling $\lambda_{\Psi}$ of a newly introduced SM singlet
complex scalar $\Psi$ must have a non-zero value at $\Lambda_{\text{MPP}}$,
which means the breaking of the MPP. We find that the ${\cal{O}}(100)$GeV
electroweak symmetry breaking can be achieved even if this breaking is very
small; $\lambda_{\Psi}(\Lambda_{\text{MPP}})\leq10^{-10}$. Within this
situation, the mass of the B-L gauge boson is predicted to be \begin{equation}
M_{B-L}=2\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{\frac{\lambda(v_{h})}{0.10}}\times v_{h}\simeq
696\hspace{1mm}\text{GeV},\nonumber\end{equation} where $\lambda$ is the Higgs
self coupling and $v_{h}$ is the Higgs expectation value. This is a remarkable
prediction of the (slightly broken) MPP. Furthermore, such a small
$\lambda_{\Psi}$ opens a new possibility: $\Psi$ plays a roll of the inflaton
\cite{Okada:2011en}. Another purpose of this paper is to investigate the
$\lambda_{\Psi}\Psi^{4}$ inflation scenario with the non-minimal gravitational
coupling $\xi\Psi^{2} {\cal{R}}$ based on the two-loop RGEs.

the particles is shown to be affected by weak and strong secondary motions of

hydrodynamical quantities, may be chosen arbitrarily, provided that it solves
Vlasov equation. Then, from the linearized version of the electrons equation of
motion, and from Gauss law, is derived an envelope equation for the wave

sets and message cognition. The model consists of a common message for all
three receivers, a private common message for only two receivers and two
additional private messages for these two receivers, such that each receiver is
only interested in one message, while being fully cognizant of the other one.
First, this model is investigated without any secrecy constraints, where the
capacity region is established, showing that the straightforward extension of
the K\""orner and Marton inner bound to the investigated scenario is optimal. In
particular, this agrees with Nair and Wang's result, which states that the idea
of indirect decoding - introduced to improve the K\""orner and Marton inner
bound - does not provide a better region for this scenario. Further, some
secrecy constraints are introduced by letting the private messages to be
confidential ones. Two different secrecy criteria are considered: joint secrecy
and individual secrecy. For both criteria, a general achievable rate region is
provided. Moreover, the joint and individual secrecy capacity regions are
established, if the two legitimate receivers are more capable than the
eavesdropper. The established capacity regions indicate that the individual
secrecy criterion can provide a larger capacity region as compared to the joint
one, because each cognizant message can be used as a secret key for the other
individual message. Further, the joint secrecy capacity is established for a
more general class of more capable channels, where only one of the two
legitimate receivers is more capable than the eavesdropper. This was done by
showing that principle of indirect decoding introduced by Nair and El Gamal is
optimal for this class of channels. This result is in contrast with the
nonsecrecy case, where the indirect decoding does not provide any gain.

in the frequency range ~10-60 GHz. One of the most scrutinized regions is
G159.6-18.5, located within the Perseus molecular complex. In this paper we
present further observations of this region (194 hours in total over ~250
deg^2), both in intensity and in polarization. They span four frequency
channels between 10 and 20 GHz, and were gathered with QUIJOTE, a new CMB
experiment with the goal of measuring the polarization of the CMB and Galactic
foregrounds. When combined with other publicly-available intensity data, we
achieve the most precise spectrum of the AME measured to date, with 13
independent data points being dominated by this emission. The four QUIJOTE data
points provide the first independent confirmation of the downturn of the AME
spectrum at low frequencies, initially unveiled by the COSMOSOMAS experiment in
this region. We accomplish an accurate fit of these data using models based on
electric dipole emission from spinning dust grains, and also fit some of the
parameters on which these models depend.
  We also present polarization maps with an angular resolution of ~1 deg and a
sensitivity of ~25 muK/beam. From these maps, which are consistent with zero
polarization, we obtain upper limits of Pi<6.3% and <2.8% (95% C.L.)
respectively at 12 and 18 GHz, a frequency range where no AME polarization
observations have been reported to date. These constraints are compatible with
theoretical predictions of the polarization fraction from electric dipole
emission originating from spinning dust grains. At the same time, they rule out
several models based on magnetic dipole emission from dust grains ordered in a
single magnetic domain, which predict higher polarization levels. Future
QUIJOTE data in this region may allow more stringent constraints on the
polarization level of the AME.

imposed by the competitive exclusion principle and apparent competition. For
the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, sustainable coexistence necessitates
nonzero determinant of the interaction matrix. Here we show that this
requirement is equivalent to demanding that each species be part of a
non-overlapping pairing, which substantially constrains the food web structure.
We demonstrate that a stable food web can always be obtained if a
non-overlapping pairing exists. If it does not, the matrix rank can be used to
quantify the lack of niches, corresponding to unpaired species. For the species
richness at each trophic level, we derive the food web assembly rules, which
specify sustainable combinations. In neighboring levels, these rules allow the
higher level to avert competitive exclusion at the lower, thereby incorporating
apparent competition. In agreement with data, the assembly rules predict high
species numbers at intermediate levels and thinning at the top and bottom.
Using comprehensive food web data, we demonstrate how omnivores or parasites
with hosts at multiple trophic levels can loosen the constraints and help
obtain coexistence in food webs. Hence, omnivory may be the glue that keeps
communities intact even under extinction or ecological release of species.

cumulene-structure in the inner part of chains with the number of atoms N>=10.
We present a general stress-strain diagram of chains until the moment when they
break, which enables to determine their strength, elasticity and fragility. For
chains with N>=4, the relationship between the strength of the chain and the
binding energy of the edge atom in the chain is established. The existence of
scale-effect and ""even-odd"" effect for such properties as strength, elasticity
and fragility is observed. We demonstrate that the 5-atom carbon chains show
the maximum strength value.

  Comments welcome",,"10.1016/j.newast.2015.07.002",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an algorithm for solving the radiative transfer problem on
massively parallel computers using adaptive mesh refinement and domain
decomposition. The solver is based on the method of characteristics which
requires an adaptive raytracer that integrates the equation of radiative
transfer. The radiation field is split into local and global components which
are handled separately to overcome the non-locality problem. The solver is
implemented in the framework of the magneto-hydrodynamics code FLASH and is
coupled by an operator splitting step. The goal is the study of radiation in
the context of star formation simulations with a focus on early disc formation
and evolution. This requires a proper treatment of radiation physics that
covers both the optically thin as well as the optically thick regimes and the
transition region in particular. We successfully show the accuracy and
feasibility of our method in a series of standard radiative transfer problems
and two 3D collapse simulations resembling the early stages of protostar and
disc formation.

generic representation offline from numerous training images. However the
offline training is time-consuming and the learned generic representation may
be less discriminative for tracking specific objects. In this paper we present
that, even without offline training with a large amount of auxiliary data,
simple two-layer convolutional networks can be powerful enough to develop a
robust representation for visual tracking. In the first frame, we employ the
k-means algorithm to extract a set of normalized patches from the target region
as fixed filters, which integrate a series of adaptive contextual filters
surrounding the target to define a set of feature maps in the subsequent
frames. These maps measure similarities between each filter and the useful
local intensity patterns across the target, thereby encoding its local
structural information. Furthermore, all the maps form together a global
representation, which is built on mid-level features, thereby remaining close
to image-level information, and hence the inner geometric layout of the target
is also well preserved. A simple soft shrinkage method with an adaptive
threshold is employed to de-noise the global representation, resulting in a
robust sparse representation. The representation is updated via a simple and
effective online strategy, allowing it to robustly adapt to target appearance
variations. Our convolution networks have surprisingly lightweight structure,

use a modern form which was developed by F. Bracci, M. Contreras, S.
D\'iaz-Madrigal et al. and which can be applied to certain higher dimensional
complex manifolds. We look at two domains in more detail: the Euclidean unit
ball and the polydisc. Here we consider two classes of biholomorphic mappings
which were introduced by T. Poreda and G. Kohr as generalizations of the class
S and we prove a conjecture about support points of these classes.
  In part 2 (Chapter 3) we consider one special Loewner equation: the chordal
multiple-slit equation in the upper half-plane. After describing basic
properties of this equation we look at the problem, whether one can choose the
coefficient functions in this equation to be constant. D. Prokhorov proved this
statement under the assumption that the slits are piecewise analytic. We use a
completely different idea to solve the problem in its general form. As the
Loewner equation with constant coefficients holds everywhere (and not just
almost everywhere), this result generalizes Loewner's original idea to the
multiple-slit case. Moreover, we consider the following problems:
  -> The ""simple-curve problem"" asks which driving functions describe the
growth of simple curves. We discuss necessary and sufficient conditions,
generalize a theorem of J. Lind, D. Marshall and S. Rohde to the multiple-slit
equation and we give an example of a set of driving functions which generate
simple curves because of a certain self-similarity property.
  -> We discuss properties of driving functions that generate slits which
enclose a given angle with the real axis.
  -> A theorem by O. Roth gives an explicit description of the reachable set of
one point in the radial Loewner equation. We prove the analog for the chordal

orbits so far, possibly as result of strong scattering. The magnetar PSR
J1745-2900 discovered in 2013 at a separation of < 3 arcsec is not the optimal
type of pulsar for studies of general relativity, but it can be used to
investigate the scattering properties so that search strategies can be adapted
accordingly. This contribution presents an observation of this magnetar using
short baselines between VLBI stations in Europe in a non-standard
interferometry mode. The most important goal is determining the distance of the
scattering screen, or the distribution of scattering material if not confined
to one screen. The analysis is based on phase-binned visibilities that allow
measuring the shape of the scattering disk and how it grows with increasing
delay over the scattering tail of the pulse profile. Narrow rings growing with
the square root of delay are expected for a single thin scattering screen and
the preliminary results are indeed consistent with this expectation. This means
that most of the angular and temporal broadening is caused by the same and
relatively thin scattering screen and that, in contrast to standard models of
the interstellar scattering behaviour near the Galactic centre, this screen is
located about halfway between the centre and us.

Within this interpretation framework, we argue that mean-field athermal
dynamics can be accounted for by the so-called H{\'e}braud-Lequeux (HL) model,
in which the mechanical noise stems explicitly from the plastic activity in the
sheared medium. Then, we show that the inclusion of structural disorder, by
means of a distribution of yield energy barriers, has no qualitative effect in
the HL model, while such a disorder is known to be one of the key ingredients
leading kinematically to a finite macroscopic yield stress in other mean-field
descriptions, such as the Soft-Glassy-Rheology model. We conclude that the
statistical mechanisms at play in the emergence of a macroscopic yield stress,
and a complex stationary dynamics at low shear rate, are different in thermal

atomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamics and structural

showed that the existence of different sites for hydrogen bonding, related to

show that hydrogenation reactions are strongly site dependent and that the
sp-hybridized carbon atoms are the preferential sites to chemical attacks. In
our cases, the effectiveness of the hydrogenation (estimated from the number of

curved magnetic field proceeds in either the synchrotron or the curvature
radiation modes. In this paper we show that in strong curved magnetic fields a
significant fraction of the energy of relativistic electrons can be radiated
away in the intermediate, the so-called synchro-curvature regime. Because of
the persistent change of the trajectory curvature, the radiation varies with
the frequency of particle gyration. While this effect can be ignored in the
synchrotron and curvature regimes, the variability plays a key role in the
formation of the synchro-curvature radiation. Using the Hamiltonian formalism,
we find that the particle trajectory has the form of a helix wound around the
drift trajectory. This allows us to calculate analytically the intensity and
energy distribution of prompt radiation in the general case of magnetic
bremsstrahlung in the curved magnetic field. We show that the transition to the
limit of the synchrotron and curvature radiation regimes is determined by the
relation between the drift velocity and the component of the particle velocity
perpendicular to the drift trajectory. The detailed numerical calculations,
which take into account the energy losses of particles, confirm the principal
conclusions based on the simplified analytical treatment of the problem, and
allow us to analyze quantitatively the transition between different radiation
regimes for a broad range of initial pitch angles. We argue that in the case of
realization of specific configurations of the electric and magnetic fields, the
gamma-ray emission of the pulsar magnetospheres can be dominated by the
component radiated in the synchro-curvature regime.

multiporosity model is an adaptation of the multirate solute transport model of
Haggerty and Gorelick (1995) to viscous flow in fractured rock reservoirs. It
is a generalization of both pseudo-steady-state and transient interporosity
flow double porosity models. The model includes a fracture continuum and an
overlapping distribution of multiple rock matrix continua, whose
fracture-matrix exchange coefficients are specified through a discrete
probability mass function. Semi-analytical cylindrically symmetric solutions to
the multiporosity mathematical model are developed using the Laplace transform
to illustrate its behavior. The multiporosity model presented here is
conceptually simple, yet flexible enough to simulate common conceptualizations
of double and triple porosity flow. This combination of generality and

differential entropy. Supposing that the correlations are weak we express the
conditional probability function of the chain through the pair correlation
function and represent the entropy as a functional of the pair correlator.
Since the model uses the two-point correlators instead of the block
probability, it makes it possible to calculate the entropy of strings at much
longer distances than using standard methods. A fluctuation contribution to the
entropy due to finiteness of random chains is examined. This contribution can
be of the same order as its regular part even at the relatively short lengths
of subsequences. A self-similar structure of entropy with respect to the
decimation transformations is revealed for some specific forms of the pair
correlation function. Application of the theory to the DNA sequence of the R3
chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster is presented.

nonlinear. Notably, the Griesmer bound, holds only in the linear case. In this
paper we characterize a family of systematic nonlinear codes for which the
Griesmer bound holds. Moreover, we show that the Griesmer bound does not
necessarily hold for a systematic code by showing explicit counterexamples. On
the other hand, we are also able to provide (weaker) versions of the Griesmer
bound holding for all systematic codes.

detects a ""signature"" of the 3D binding site of a given ligand in a protein 3D
structure. The said signature is a 3D motif in the form of an irregular
tetrahedron whose vertices represent the backbone or side-chain centroids of
the amino acid residues at the binding site that physically interact with the
bound ligand atoms. The motif is determined from a set of solved training
structures, all of which bind the ligand. Just as alignment of linear amino
acid sequences enables one to determine consensus sequences in proteins, the
present method allows the determination of three-dimensional consensus
structures or ""motifs"" in folded proteins. Although such is accomplished by the
present method not by alignment of 3D protein structures or parts thereof
(e.g., alignment of ligand atoms from different structures) but by
nearest-neighbor analysis of ligand atoms in protein-bound forms, the same
effect, and thus the same goal, is achieved. We have applied our method to the
prediction of GTP- and ATP-binding protein families, namely, the small Ras-type
G-protein and ser/thr protein kinase families. Validation tests reveal that the
specificity of our method is nearly 100% for both protein families, and a
sensitivity of greater than 60% for the ser/thr protein kinase family and
approx. 93% for the small, Ras-type G-protein family. Further tests reveal that
our algorithm can distinguish effectively between GTP and GTP-like ligands, and
between ATP- and ATP-like ligands. The method was applied to a set of predicted
(by 123D threading) protein structures from the slime mold (D. dictyostelium)
proteome, with promising results.

  of Twisted Light","12 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.class-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The existence of twisted light may be inferred from modern quantum concepts
and experimental data. These waves possess energy, impulse and angular
momentum. However, the Maxwell's four-dimensional theory of electromagnetism
does not imply the existence of waves with these properties. This article
develops a model generalizing the theory of electromagnetism in such a way that
it would be possible to obtain equations of twisted electromagnetic waves.
Generalization is implemented by introduction of a space-time with a more
complex structure compared to the four-dimensional space-time. Such spaces
include a seven-dimensional space-time, which allows to describe not only
translational, but also rotational motion of bodies. A model developed by the
author provides the following results: 1) generalization of the theory of
electromagnetism in which it is possible to obtain equations of twisted light
waves, 2) solution describing interference of light waves oppositely twisted,
3) the formula relating the energy, impulse and angular momentum of
electromagnetic wave, 4) justification of a new phenomenon - redshift due to
electromagnetic waves screwing.
