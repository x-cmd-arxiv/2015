of the VLT LBG Redshift Survey. The data encompasses 5 independent survey
fields co-spatial with spectroscopic LBG data and covering a larger total area
than previously analysed for LAE number counts and clustering. This affords an
improved analysis over previous work by minimising the effects of cosmic
variance and allowing the cross-clustering analysis of LAEs and LBGs. Our
photometric sample consists of $\approx600$ LAE candidates, over an area of
1.07~deg$^2$, with equivalent widths of $\gtrsim65$~\AA\ and a flux limit of
$\approx2\times10^{-17}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. From spectroscopic follow-up,
we measured a success rate of $78\pm18\%$. We find the $R$-band continuum
luminosity function to be $\sim10\times$ lower than the luminosity function of
LBGs at this redshift, consistent with previous studies. Exploiting the large
area of the survey, we estimate the LAE auto-correlation function and find a
clustering length of $r_0=2.86\pm0.33~h^{-1}$~Mpc, low compared to the $z\sim3$
LBG population, but somewhat higher than previous LAE measurements. This
corresponds to a median halo mass of $M_{\rm
DM}=10^{11.0\pm0.3}~h^{-1}~$M$_{\odot}$. We present an analysis of clustering
length versus continuum magnitude and find that the measurements for LAEs and
LBGs are consistent at faint magnitudes. Our combined dataset of LAEs and LBGs
allows us to measure, for the first time, the LBG-LAE cross-correlation,
finding a clustering length of $r_0=3.29\pm0.57~h^{-1}$~Mpc and a LAE halo mass
of $10^{11.1\pm0.4}~h^{-1}$~M$_{\odot}$. Overall, we conclude that LAEs inhabit
primarily low mass halos, but form a relatively small proportion of the galaxy
population found in such halos.

clusters, many globular cluster formation theories require two independent
episodes of star formation. A fundamental prediction of these models is that
the clusters must accumulate large gas reservoirs as the raw material to form
the second stellar generation. We show that young clusters containing the
required gas reservoir should exhibit the following observational signatures:
(i) a dip in the measured luminosity profile or an increase in measured
reddening towards the cluster centre, with Av >10mag within a radius of a few
pc; (ii) bright (sub)mm emission from dust grains; (iii) bright molecular line
emission once the gas is dense enough to begin forming stars. Unless the IMF is
anomalously skewed towards low-mass stars, the clusters should also show
obvious signs of star formation via optical emission lines (e.g. H_alpha) after
the stars have formed. These observational signatures should be readily
observable towards any compact clusters (radii of a few pc) in the nearby
Universe with masses > 10^6 Msun and ages <100Myr. This provides a
straightforward way to directly test globular cluster formation models which
predict large gas reservoirs are required to form the second stellar
generation. The fact that no such observational evidence exists calls into
question whether such a mechanism happens regularly for YMCs in galaxies within
a few tens of Mpc.

usually captured by sensing equipments with their spectral fingerprints. Though
spectra of pure chemicals can be identified by visual inspection, the spectra
of their mixtures take a variety of complicated forms. Given the knowledge of
spectral references of the constituent chemicals, the task of data fitting is
to retrieve their weights, and this usually can be obtained by solving a least
squares problem. Complications occur if the basis functions (reference spectra)
may not be used directly to best fit the data. In fact, random distortions
(spectral variability) such as shifting, compression, and expansion have been
observed in some source spectra when the underlying substances are mixed. In
this paper, we formulate mathematical model for such nonlinear effects and
build them into data fitting algorithms. If minimal knowledge of the
distortions is available, a deterministic approach termed {\it augmented least
squares} is developed and it fits the spectral references along with their
derivatives to the mixtures. If the distribution of the distortions is known a
prior, we consider to solve the problem with maximum likelihood estimators
which incorporate the shifts into the variance matrix. The proposed methods are
substantiated with numerical examples including data from Raman spectroscopy

gas, using either the anelastic approximation or the fully compressible
equations, are compared. Theoretically, the anelastic approximation is expected
to hold in weakly superadiabatic systems with $\epsilon = \Delta T / T_r \ll
1$, where $\Delta T$ denotes the superadiabatic temperature drop over the
convective layer and $T_r$ the bottom temperature. Using direct numerical
simulations, a systematic comparison of anelastic and fully compressible
convection is carried out. With decreasing superadiabaticity $\epsilon$, the
fully compressible results are found to converge linearly to the anelastic
solution with larger density contrasts generally improving the match. We
conclude that in many solar and planetary applications, where the
superadiabaticity is expected to be vanishingly small, results obtained with
the anelastic approximation are in fact more accurate than fully compressible
computations, which typically fail to reach small $\epsilon$ for numerical
reasons. On the other hand, if the astrophysical system studied contains
$\epsilon\sim O(1)$ regions, such as the solar photosphere, fully compressible
simulations have the advantage of capturing the full physics. Interestingly,
even in weakly superadiabatic regions, like the bulk of the solar convection
zone, the errors introduced by using artificially large values for $\epsilon$
for efficiency reasons remain moderate. If quantitative errors of the order of
$10\%$ are acceptable in such low $\epsilon$ regions, our work suggests that
fully compressible simulations can indeed be computationally more efficient
than their anelastic counterparts.

a process of hierarchical merging and accretion. Through this paradigm,
multiple SMBH systems are expected to be relatively common in the Universe.
However, to date there are poor observational constraints on multiple SMBHs
systems with separations comparable to a SMBH gravitational sphere of influence
(<< 1 kpc). In this chapter, we discuss how deep continuum observations with
the SKA will make leading contributions towards understanding how multiple
black hole systems impact galaxy evolution. In addition, these observations
will provide constraints on and an understanding of stochastic gravitational
wave background detections in the pulsar timing array sensitivity band (nanoHz
-microHz). We also discuss how targets for pointed gravitational wave
experiments (that cannot be resolved by VLBI) could potentially be found using
the large-scale radio-jet morphology, which can be modulated by the presence of
a close-pair binary SMBH system. The combination of direct imaging at high
angular resolution; low-surface brightness radio-jet tracers; and pulsar timing
arrays will allow the SKA to trace black hole binary evolution from separations
of a galaxy virial radius down to the sub-parsec level. This large dynamic
range in binary SMBH separation will ensure that the SKA plays a leading role
in this observational frontier.

far-infrared counterparts for 354 quasars, among which 134 are highly secure
detections in the Herschel $250~\mu m$ band (signal-to-noise ratios $\geq5$).
This sample is the largest far-infrared quasar sample of its kind, and spans a
wide redshift range of $0.14{\leq}z\leq 4.7$. Their far-infrared spectral
energy distributions, which are due to the cold dust components within the host
galaxies, are consistent with being heated by active star formation. In most
cases ($\gtrsim80$\%), their total infrared luminosities as inferred from only
their far-infrared emissions ($L_{IR}^{(cd)}$) already exceed
$10^{12}~L_{\odot}$, and thus these objects qualify as ultra-luminous infrared
galaxies. There is no correlation between $L_{IR}^{(cd)}$ and the absolute
magnitudes, the black hole masses or the X-ray luminosities of the quasars,
which further support that their far-infrared emissions are not due to their
active galactic nuclei. A large fraction of these objects
($\gtrsim50\text{--}60\%$) have star formation rates $\gtrsim
300~M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$. Such extreme starbursts among optical quasars, however,
is only a few per cent. This fraction varies with redshift, and peaks at around
$z\approx2$. Among the entire sample, 136 objects have secure estimates of
their cold-dust temperatures ($T$), and we find that there is a dramatic
increasing trend of $T$ with increasing $L_{IR}^{(cd)}$. We interpret this
trend as the envelope of the general distribution of infrared galaxies on the

not visited by $W$ walkers and by one walker within time $t$. The problem of
finding the distinct nodes visited by $W$ walkers, effectively, can be reduced
to that of a single walker. The robustness of the results is demonstrated by
verifying them on four different real-world networks that approximately display
scale-free structure.

economics to estimate complex models with an intractable likelihood. In other

(ABC) is far more popular. This paper connects these two seemingly related
approaches to likelihood-free estimation by means of a Reverse Sampler that
uses both optimization and importance weighting to target the posterior
distribution. Its hybrid features enable us to analyze an ABC estimate from the
perspective of SMD. We show that an ideal ABC estimate can be obtained as a
weighted average of a sequence of SMD modes, each being the minimizer of the
deviations between the data and the model. This contrasts with the SMD, which
is the mode of the average deviations. Using stochastic expansions, we provide
a general characterization of frequentist estimators and those based on
Bayesian computations including Laplace-type estimators. Their differences are
illustrated using analytical examples and a simulation study of the dynamic

whole space, which requires the introduction of a renormalized free energy into
the dual formula. We also extend this duality to higher dimensions and
establish an extension of the Onofri inequality to spheres $\s^n$ with $n\geq

$F(\rho)=-n\rho^{1-\frac{1}{n}}$, which means that both the {\it prescribed

measure radio, infrared, optical, and X-ray fluxes in three regions along the
jet determined by the infrared and X-ray morphology. Radio through X-ray
spectra in these regions demonstrate that the emission can be interpreted as
synchrotron emission from a broken power-law distribution of electron energies.
We find significant differences in the high energy spectra with increasing
distance from the nucleus. Specifically, the high energy slope increases from
0.86 to 1.72 from 1 kpc to 12 kpc along the jet, and the spectral break
likewise increases in frequency along the jet from 10-100's of GHz to ~20 THz.
Thus the ratio of IR to X-ray flux in the jet increases by at least an order of
magnitude with increasing distance from the nucleus. We argue that these
changes cannot simply be the result of spectral aging and that there is ongoing
particle acceleration through this region of the jet. The effects of mass
loading, turbulence, and jet deceleration, however these processes modify the
jet flow in detail, must be causing a change in the electron energy
distribution and the efficiency of particle acceleration.

mixing states of integer and half-integer spin. Such ""hastatic order""
(hasta:[Latin]spear) hybridizes Kramers conduction electrons with Ising,
non-Kramers 5f2 states of the uranium atoms to produce Ising quasiparticles.
The development of a spinorial hybridization at 17.5K accounts for both the
large entropy of condensation and the magnetic anomaly observed in torque
magnetometry. This paper develops the theory of hastatic order in detail,
providing the mathematical development of its key concepts. Hastatic order
predicts a tiny transverse moment in the conduction sea, a collosal Ising
anisotropy in the nonlinear susceptibility anomaly and a resonant
energy-dependent nematicity in the tunneling density of states.

(1) Gene duplication, which is followed by rapid diversification of duplicate
interactions. (2) Neofunctionalization, in which a mutation leads to a new
interaction with some other protein. Since many interactions are due to simple
surface compatibility, we hypothesize there is an increased likelihood of
interacting with other proteins in the target protein's neighborhood. We find
good agreement of the model on 10 different network properties compared to
high-confidence experimental PPI networks in yeast, fruit flies, and humans.
Key findings are: (1) PPI networks evolve modular structures, with no need to
invoke particular selection pressures. (2) Proteins in cells have on average
about 6 degrees of separation, similar to some social networks, such as
human-communication and actor networks. (3) Unlike social networks, which have
a shrinking diameter (degree of maximum separation) over time, PPI networks are
predicted to grow in diameter. (4) The model indicates that evolutionarily old
proteins should have higher connectivities and be more centrally embedded in
their networks. This suggests a way in which present-day proteomics data could
provide insights into biological evolution.

rotation profile by tracing the motions of CBPs detected by the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).
We also investigate problems related to detection of coronal bright points
resulting from instrument and detection algorithm limitations. To determine the
positions and identification of coronal bright points we used a segmentation
algorithm. A linear fit of their central meridian distance and latitude versus
time was utilised to derive velocities. We obtained 906 velocity measurements
in a time interval of only 2 days. The differential rotation profile can be
expressed as $\omega_{rot} = (14.47\pm 0.10 + (0.6\pm 1.0)\sin^{2}(b) +
(-4.7\pm 1.7)\sin^{4}(b))$\degr day$^{-1}$. Our result is in agreement with
other work and it comes with reasonable errors in spite of the very short time
interval used. This was made possible by the higher sensitivity and resolution
of the AIA instrument compared to similar equipment as well as high cadence.
The segmentation algorithm also played a crucial role by detecting so many
CBPs, which reduced the errors to a reasonable level. Data and methods
presented in this paper show a great potential to obtain very accurate velocity
profiles, both for rotation and meridional motion and, consequently, Reynolds
stresses. The amount of coronal bright point data that could be obtained from
this instrument should also provide a great opportunity to study changes of
velocity patterns with a temporal resolution of only a few months. Other
possibilities are studies of evolution of CBPs and proper motions of magnetic

neither the path difference, nor the mode profile in the aligned case.
Nevertheless, the same slight variations of the interferometer mirrors now give

with spots should depend on the inclination of its rotational axis relative to
our line of sight. Therefore, the distribution of observed rotational
amplitudes of a large sample of stars depends on the distribution of their
projected axes of rotation. Thus, comparison of the stellar rotational
amplitudes of the Kepler KOIs with those of Kepler single stars can provide a
measure to indirectly infer the properties of the spin-orbit obliquity of
Kepler planets. We apply this technique to the large samples of 993 KOIs and
33,614 single Kepler stars in temperature range of 3500-6500 K. We find with
high significance that the amplitudes of cool KOIs are larger, on the order of
10%, than those of the single stars. In contrast, the amplitudes of hot KOIs
are systematically lower. After correcting for an observational bias, we
estimate that the amplitudes of the hot KOIs are smaller than the single stars
by about the same factor of 10%. The border line between the relatively larger
and smaller amplitudes, relative to the amplitudes of the single stars, occurs
at about 6000K. Our results suggest that the cool stars have their planets
aligned with their stellar rotation, while the planets around hot stars have
large obliquities, consistent with the findings of Winn et al. (2010) and
Albrecht et al. (2012). We show that the low obliquity of the planets around
cool stars extends up to at least 50 days, a feature that is not expected in
the framework of a model that assumes the low obliquity is due to planet-star
tidal realignment.

progress has been made in theoretical simulations and observations of HI in
galaxies. However, recent HI surveys on both single dish radio telescopes and
interferometers, while providing detailed information on global HI properties,
the dark matter distribution in galaxies, as well as insight into the
relationship between star formation and the interstellar medium, have been
limited to the local universe. Ongoing and upcoming HI surveys on SKA
pathfinder instruments will extend these measurements beyond the local universe
to intermediate redshifts with long observing programmes. We present here an
overview of the HI science which will be possible with the increased
capabilities of the SKA and which will build upon the expected increase in
knowledge of HI in and around galaxies obtained with the SKA pathfinder
surveys. With the SKA1 the greatest improvement over our current measurements
is the capability to image galaxies at reasonable linear resolution and good
column density sensitivity to much higher redshifts (0.2 < z < 1.7). So one
will not only be able to increase the number of detections to study the
evolution of the HI mass function, but also have the sensitivity and resolution
to study inflows and outflows to and from galaxies and the kinematics of the
gas within and around galaxies as a function of environment and cosmic time out
to previously unexplored depths. The increased sensitivity of SKA2 will allow
us to image Milky Way-size galaxies out to redshifts of z=1 and will provide
the data required for a comprehensive picture of the HI content of galaxies
back to z~2 when the cosmic star formation rate density was at its peak.

observed excess in the Fermi-LAT spectrum of gamma rays from the Galactic
Centre, while fulfilling all the current experimental constraints from the LHC
as well as from direct and indirect dark matter searches. We have explored the
parameter space of this scenario, computed the gamma ray spectrum for each
phenomenologically viable solution and then performed a chi^2 fit to the
excess. Unlike previous studies based on model independent interpretations, we
have taken into account the full annihilation spectrum, without assuming pure
annihilation channels. Furthermore, we have incorporated limits from direct
detection experiments, LHC bounds and also the constraints from Fermi-LAT on
dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and gamma ray spectral lines. In addition, we
have estimated the effect of the most recent Fermi-LAT reprocessed data (Pass
8). In general, we obtain good fits to the GCE when the RH sneutrino
annihilates mainly into pairs of light singlet-like scalar or pseudoscalar
Higgs bosons that subsequently decay in flight, producing four-body final
states and spectral features that improve the goodness of the fit at large
energies. The best fit (chi^2=20.8) corresponds to a RH sneutrino with a mass
of 64 GeV which annihilates preferentially into a pair of light singlet-like
pseudoscalar Higgs bosons (with masses of order 60 GeV). Besides, we have
analysed other channels that also provide good fits to the excess. Finally, we
discuss the implications for direct and indirect detection searches paying
special attention to the possible appearance of gamma ray spectral features in
near future Fermi-LAT analyses, as well as deviations from the SM-like Higgs
properties at the LHC. Remarkably, many of the scenarios that fit the GCE can
also be probed by these other complementary techniques.

computation. Arbitrary fault-tolerant operations can be constructed from a
small, universal set of fault-tolerant operations by gate compilation. Quantum
chemistry algorithms are compiled by decomposing the dynamics of the coupled
spin-system using a Trotter formula, synthesizing the decomposed dynamics using
Clifford operations and single-qubit rotations, and finally approximating the
single-qubit rotations by a sequence of fault-tolerant single-qubit gates.
Certain fault-tolerant gates rely on the preparation of specific single-qubit
states referred to as magic states. As a result, gate compilation and magic

crystalline protection of the surface state (SS) band structure has led to a
series of intriguing predictions of strain generated phenomena, from the
appearance of pseudo-magnetic fields and helical flat bands, to the tunability
of the Dirac SS by strain that may be used to construct ""straintronic""
nanoswitches. However, practical realization of this exotic phenomenology via
strain engineering is experimentally challenging and is yet to be achieved. In
this work, we have designed an experiment to not only generate and measure
strain locally, but to also directly measure the resulting effects on the Dirac
SS. We grow heteroepitaxial thin films of TCI SnTe in-situ and measure them by
using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Large STM images
were analyzed to determine picoscale changes in the atomic positions which
reveal regions of both tensile and compressive strain. Simultaneous
Fourier-transform STM was then used to determine the effects of strain on the
Dirac electrons. We find that strain continuously tunes the momentum space
position of the Dirac points, consistent with theoretical predictions. Our work
demonstrates the fundamental mechanism necessary for using TCIs in strain-based
applications, and establishes these systems as highly tunable platforms for
nanodevices.

many binaries. Our Bayesian fitting technique yields inferred values of age,
metallicity, distance modulus, and absorption as a function of the photometric
band combinations and stellar models. We show that the historically-favored
three band combinations of UBV and VRI can be meaningfully inconsistent with
each other and with longer baseline datasets such as UBVRIJHKs. Differences
among model sets can also be substantial. For instance, fitting Yi et al.

fitting errors, these two fits are substantially and statistically different.
Such differences amongst fits using different filters and models are a
cautionary tale regarding our current ability to fit star cluster

evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs a
different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star
formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each
reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the
simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show
analytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that
reduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are
greatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by
injecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with
the observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling
relations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of
the reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of
galaxies with stellar mass <~ M* (the ""knee"" of the galaxy stellar mass
function) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation,
while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from
accretion onto their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in
order to reproduce the observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that
have been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function
will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement that
galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of

parameter in explosive percolation transitions turned out to be very small,
these transitions were first believed to be discontinuous. In this article we
analyze the evolution starting from clusters of nodes whose sizes are
distributed according to a power law. We show that these initial distributions
change dramatically the position and order of the phase transitions in these
problems. We find a particular initial power-law distribution producing a
peculiar effect on explosive percolation, namely before the emergence of the
percolation cluster, the system is in a ""critical phase"" with an infinite
generalized susceptibility. This critical phase is absent in ordinary
percolation models with any power-law initial conditions. The transition from
the critical phase is an infinite order phase transition, which resembles the
scenario of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition. We obtain the
critical singularity of susceptibility at this peculiar infinite-order
transition in explosive percolation. It turns out that the susceptibility in
this situation does not obey the Curie-Weiss law.

variational method for dissipative quantum transport at arbitrary

theory. The optimal polaron transformation is determined by the optimization of
the Feynman-Bogoliubov upper bound of free energy. % which is variational in
nature. The free energy minimization ends up with an optimal mean-field
Hamiltonian and a minimal interaction Hamiltonian. Hence, second-order
perturbation can be applied to the transformed system, resulting an accurate
and efficient method for the treatment of dissipative quantum transport with
arbitrary electron-phonon coupling strength. Numerical benchmark calculation on
an single site model with coupling to one phonon mode is also presented.

lithium-rich pre-main sequence stars shows a secondary population that is
kinematically distinct from and younger than NGC 2547. The radial velocities,
lithium absorption lines, and the positions in a colour-magnitude diagram of

simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART). This algorithm, denoted
pSART, replaces the monoenergetic forward projection operation used by SART
with a post-log, polyenergetic forward projection, while leaving the rest of
the algorithm unchanged. While the proposed algorithm provides good results
empirically, convergence of the algorithm was not established mathematically in
the original paper.
  Methods: We analyze pSART as a nonlinear fixed point iteration by explicitly
computing the Jacobian of the iteration. A necessary condition for convergence
is that the spectral radius of the Jacobian, evaluated at the fixed point, is
less than one. A short proof of convergence for SART is also provided as a
basis for comparison.
  Results: We show that the pSART algorithm is not guaranteed to converge, in
general. The Jacobian of the iteration depends on several factors, including
the system matrix and how one models the energy dependence of the linear
attenuation coefficient. We provide a simple numerical example that shows that
the spectral radius of the Jacobian matrix is not guaranteed to be less than
one. A second set of numerical experiments using realistic CT system matrices,
however, indicates that conditions for convergence are likely to be satisfied
in practice.
  Conclusion: Although pSART is not mathematically guaranteed to converge, our
numerical experiments indicate that it will tend to converge at roughly the
same rate as SART for system matrices of the type encountered in CT imaging.
Thus we conclude that the algorithm is still a useful method for reconstruction
of polyenergetic CT data.

model and were shown to enable significant control over the direction of
neurite outgrowth in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)

anyonic system have been discussed in the literature: projective measurement of
a single point-like quasiparticle and interferometric measurement of the total
topological charge of a group of quasiparticles. Projective measurement by
definition is only applied near a point and will project to a topological
charge sector near that point. Thus, if it is to be applied to a \emph{group}
of anyons to project to a \emph{total} charge, then the anyons must first be
fused one by one to obtain a single anyon carrying the collective charge. We
show that interferometric measurement is strictly stronger: Any protocol
involving projective measurement can be simulated at low overhead by another
protocol involving only interferometric measurement.

reducing their detection bandwidth, which origins from the propagation phase
delay of the light. The ""white-light-cavity"" idea, first proposed by Wicht et
al. [Optics Communications 134, 431 (1997)], is to circumvent this limitation
by introducing anomalous dispersion, using double-pumped gain medium, to
compensate for such phase delay. In this article, starting from the Hamiltonian
of atom-light interaction, we apply the input-output formalism to evaluate the
quantum noise of the system. We find that apart from the additional noise
associated with the parametric amplification process noticed by others, the
stability condition for the entire system poses an additional constraint.
Through surveying the parameter regimes where the gain medium remains stable
(not lasing) and stationary, we find that there is no net enhancement of the
shot-noise limited sensitivity. Therefore, other gain mediums or different
parameter regimes shall be explored for realizing the white light cavity.

indeed found to be well reproduced by collisional BSS models. In contrast, no
specific models for mass transfer BSSs were available for an old stellar system
like M30. Here we present binary evolution models, including case-B mass
transfer and binary merging, specifically calculated for this cluster. We
discuss in detail the evolutionary track of a $0.9+0.5 M_\odot$ binary, which
spends approximately 4 Gyr in the BSS region of the CMD of a 13 Gyr old
cluster. We also run Monte-Carlo simulations to study the distribution of mass
transfer BSSs in the CMD and to compare it with the observational data. Our
results show that: (1) the color and magnitude distribution of synthetic mass
transfer BSSs defines a strip in the CMD that nicely matches the observed red
BSS sequence, thus providing strong support to the mass transfer origin for
these stars; (2) the CMD distribution of synthetic BSSs never attains the
observed location of the blue BSS sequence, thus reinforcing the hypothesis
that the latter formed through a different channel (likely collisions); (3)
most ($\sim 60\%$) of the synthetic BSSs are produced by mass-transfer models,

adversary-information that is considered sensitive in today's society.
  In this work, we focus on the challenge of preserving the privacy of users'
social contacts, while still enabling the design of social trust based
applications. First, we propose LinkMirage, a community detection based
algorithm for anonymizing links in social network topologies; LinkMirage
preserves community structures in the social topology while anonymizing links
within the communities. LinkMirage considers the evolution of the social
network topologies, and minimizes privacy leakage due to temporal dynamics of
the system.
  Second, we define metrics for quantifying the privacy and utility of a time
series of social topologies with anonymized links. We analyze the privacy and
utility provided by LinkMirage both theoretically, as well as using real world
social network topologies: a Facebook dataset with 870K links and a large-scale
Google+ dataset with 940M links. We find that our approach significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-art.
  Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of LinkMirage in real-world
applications such as Sybil defenses, reputation systems, anonymity systems and
vertex anonymity. We also prototype LinkMirage as a Facebook application such
that real world systems can bootstrap privacy-preserving trust relationships
without the cooperation of the OSN operators.

program is supposed to do, into a computer program that does what the
specification says to do. This is equivalent to constructing any computer
program and a sound proof that it meets the given specification.
  We axiomatically prove statements of the form: program PROG meets
specification SPEC. We derive 7 axioms from the definition of the PHP
programming language in which the programs are to be written. For each
primitive function or process described, we write a program that uses only that
feature (function or process), and we have an axiom that this program meets the
specification described. Generic ways to alter or combine programs, that meet
known specifications, into new programs that meet known specifications, are our
7 rules of inference.
  To efficiently prove statements that some program meets a given
specification, we work backwards from the specification. We apply the inverses
of the rules to the specifications that we must meet, until we reach axioms
that are combined by these rules to prove that a particular program meets the
given specification. Due to their distinct nature, typically few inverse rules
apply. To avoid complex wff and program manipulation algorithms, we advocate
the use of simple table maintenance and look-up functions to simulate these
complexities as a prototype.

constrained variational model involving local and nonlocal regularization. On
one hand, recent patch-wise methods can be represented as a low-rank matrix
approximation problem whose convex relaxation usually depends on nuclear norm
minimization (NNM). Here, we extend the NNM to the nonconvex schatten p-norm
minimization with additional weights assigned to different singular values,
which is referred to as the Weighted Schatten p-Norm Minimization (WSNM). An
efficient algorithm is also proposed to solve the WSNM problem. The proposed
WSNM not only gives better approximation to the original low-rank assumption,
but also considers physical meanings of different data components. On the other
hand, due to the naive aggregation schema which integrates all the denoised
patches into a whole image, current patch-wise denoising methods always produce
various degree of artifacts in denoised results. Therefore, to further reduce
artifacts, a data-driven regularizer called Steering Total Variation (STV)
combined with nonlocal TV is derived for a variational model, which imposes
local and nonlocal consistency constraints on the patch-wise denoised image. A
highly simple but efficient algorithm is proposed to solve this variational
model with convergence guarantee. Both WSNM and local \& nonlocal consistent
regularization are integrated into an iterative restoration framework to
produce final results. Extensive experimental testing shows, both qualitatively
and quantitatively, that the proposed method can effectively remove noise, as
well as reduce artifacts compared with state-of-the-art methods.

it is shown that the (1+3)-dimensional cases of derived two classes of field

represent (asymptotically) new massive forms of bispinor fields of spin-3/2 and

X-ray emission, making it a so-called gamma Cas analogue. Monitoring the
optical spectra could provide hints towards the origin of these very different
behaviours. We analyse a large set of spectroscopic observations of HD45314 and
HD60848, extending over 20 years. We further attempt to fit the H-alpha line
profiles of both stars with a simple model of emission line formation in a
Keplerian disk. Strong variations in the strengths of the H-alpha, H-beta, and
He I 5876 emission lines are observed for both stars. In the case of HD60848,
we find a time lag between the variations in the equivalent widths of these
lines. The emission lines are double peaked with nearly identical strengths of
the violet and red peaks. The H-alpha profile of this star can be successfully
reproduced by our model of a disk seen under an inclination of 30 degrees. In
the case of HD45314, the emission lines are highly asymmetric and display
strong line profile variations. We find a major change in behaviour between the
2002 outburst and the one observed in 2013. This concerns both the relationship
between the equivalent widths of the various lines and their morphologies at
maximum strength (double-peaked in 2002 versus single-peaked in 2013). Our
simple disk model fails to reproduce the observed H-alpha line profiles of
HD45314. Our results further support the interpretation that Oe stars do have
decretion disks similar to those of Be stars. Whilst the emission lines of
HD60848 are explained by a disk with a Keplerian velocity field, the disk of
HD45314 seems to have a significantly more complex velocity field that could be
related to the phenomenon that produces its peculiar X-ray emission.

dipoles. In the corresponding effective Maxwell equation these dipoles are
described by three dimensional delta function potentials. We review the
approaches handling these: the selfadjoint extension,
regularization/renormalisation and the zero range potential methods. Their
close interrelations are discussed in detail and compared with the
electrostatic approach which drops the contributions from the self fields. For
a homogeneous two dimensional lattice of dipoles we write down the complete
solutions, which allow, for example, for an easy numerical treatment of the
scattering of the electromagnetic field on the lattice or for investigating
plasmons. Using these formulas, we consider the limiting case of vanishing
lattice spacing. For a scalar field and for the TE polarization of the
electromagnetic field this transition is smooth and results in the results
known from the continuous sheet. Especially for the TE polarization, we
reproduce the results known from the hydrodynamic model describing a two
dimensional electron gas. For the TM polarization, for polarizability parallel
and perpendicular to the lattice, in both cases, the transition is singular.
For the parallel polarizability this is surprising and different from the
hydrodynamic model. For perpendicular polarizability this is what was known in
literature. We also investigate the case when the transition is done with
dipoles described by smeared delta function, i.e., keeping a regularization.
Here, for TM polarization for parallel polarizability, when subsequently doing
the limit of vanishing lattice spacing, we reproduce the result known from the
hydrodynamic model. In case of perpendicular polarizability we need an
additional renormalization to reproduce the result obtained previously by
stepping back from the dipole approximation.

cool. The extant purpose of this endeavour is to study the early phases of
core-formation. The observed evolution of this cloud supports the conjecture
that molecular clouds themselves are three-phase media (comprising viz. a
stable cold and warm medium, and a third thermally unstable medium), though it
appears, clouds may evolve in this manner irrespective of whether they are
gravitationally bound. We report, this sheet fragments initially due to the
growth of the thermal instability and some fragments are elongated,
filament-like. Subsequently, relatively large fragments become gravitationally
unstable and sub-fragment into smaller cores. The formation of cores appears to
be a three stage process : first, growth of the thermal instability leads to
rapid fragmentation of the slab; second, relatively small fragments acquire
mass via gas-accretion and/or merger and third, sufficiently massive fragments
become susceptible to the gravitational instability and sub-fragment to form
smaller cores. We investigate typical properties of clumps (and smaller cores)
resulting from this fragmentation process. Findings of this work support the
suggestion that the weak velocity field usually observed in dense clumps and
smaller cores is likely seeded by the growth of dynamic instabilities.

plasma disruptions in the TEXTOR tokamak the mechanisms of the formation of
runaway electron beams and their losses are proposed. The plasma disruption is
caused by strong stochastic magnetic field formed due to nonlinearly excited
low-mode number magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes. It is hypothesized that the
runaway electron beam is formed in the central plasma region confined by an
intact magnetic surface due to the acceleration of electrons by the inductive
toroidal electric field. In the case of plasmas with the safety factor $q(0)<1$
the most stable runaway electron beams are formed by the intact magnetic
surface located between the magnetic surface $q=1$ and the closest low--order
rational surface $q=m/n>1$ ($q=5/4$, $q=4/3$, ...). The thermal quench time the
current quench time are estimated. The runaway electron beam current is modeled
as a sum of toroidally symmetric part and a small amplitude helical current
with a predominant $m/n=1/1$ component. The runaway electrons are lost due to
two effects: ($i$) by outward drift of electrons in a toroidal electric field
until they touch wall and ($ii$) by the formation of stochastic layer of
runaway electrons at the beam edge. Such a stochastic layer for high--energy
runaway electrons is formed in the presence of the $m/n=1/1$ MHD mode. It has a
mixed topological structure with a stochastic region open to wall. The effect
of external resonant magnetic perturbations on runaway electron loss is
discussed. A possible cause of the sudden MHD signals accompanied by runaway
electron bursts is explained by the redistribution of runaway current during
the resonant interaction of high--energetic electron orbits with the $m/n=1/1$
MHD mode.

equations to accurately quantify the precision of ray tracing techniques

the recipe in (Green & Wald, 2012) for going between N-body results and a
perturbed FLRW metric in the Newtonian gauge is used to study light propagation
through quasi-spherical Szekeres models. The study is conducted by deriving a
set of ODEs giving an expression for the angular diameter distance in the
Newtonian gauge metric. The accuracy of the results obtained from the ODEs is
estimated by using the ODEs to determine the distance-redshift relation in mock
N-body data based on quasi-spherical Szekeres models. The results are then
compared to the exact relations. From this comparison it is seen that the
obtained ODEs can accurately reproduce the distance-redshift relation along
both radial and non-radial geodesics in spherically symmetric models. The
reproduction of geodesics in non-symmetric Szekeres models is slightly less
accurate, but still good. These results indicate that the employment of
perturbed FLRW metrics for standard ray tracing techniques yields fairly
accurate results, at least regarding distance-redshift relations. It is
possible though, that this conclusion will be rendered invalid if other typical
ray tracing approximations are included and if light is allowed to travel
through several structures instead of just one.

magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) formation simulations and 2D semi-analytical model
are studied. The dust temperature structure is determined through continuum
radiative transfer RADMC3D modelling. A simple temperature dependent CO
abundance structure is adopted and synthetic spectrally resolved submm
rotational molecular lines up to $J_{\rm u} = 10$ are simulated. All models
predict similar compact components in continuum if observed at the spatial
resolutions of 0.5-1$""$ (70-140 AU) typical of the observations to date. A
spatial resolution of $\sim$14 AU and high dynamic range ($> 1000$) are
required to differentiate between RSD and pseudo-disk in the continuum. The
peak-position velocity diagrams indicate that the pseudo-disk shows a flatter
velocity profile with radius than an RSD. On larger-scales, the CO isotopolog
single-dish line profiles are similar and are narrower than the observed line
widths of low-$J$ lines, indicating significant turbulence in the large-scale
envelopes. However a forming RSD can provide the observed line widths of
high-$J$ lines. Thus, either RSDs are common or a higher level of turbulence
($b \sim 0.8 \ {\rm km \ s^{-1}}$ ) is required in the inner envelope compared
with the outer part. Multiple spatially and spectrally resolved molecular line
observations are needed. The continuum data give a better estimate on disk
masses whereas the disk sizes can be estimated from the spatially resolved
molecular lines observations. The general observable trends are similar between
the 2D semi-analytical models and 3D MHD RSD simulations.

interface between air and negatively refractive photonic crystal (NRPhC) with

exhibits inverse GH shift in TM and TE polarization, and the localization and
pattern of energy flux differ in TM and TE polarizations and are strongly
affected by surface termination. This is different to the condition of negative
permittivity materials (i.e., metal), which only presents inverse GH shift in
TM polarization. In the case of TE polarization, the energy flux pattern
exhibits the flux of backward wave whose localization changes from the surface
to inside of NRPhC with the variation of surface termination. In the case of TM
polarization, the energy flux pattern is always confined within the surface of
NRPhC, whereas its pattern changes from the flux of backward wave to vortices
at the surface of NRPhC, which is different to the energy flux of TM
polarization of metal. By properly truncating the surface of NRPhC we can
control the magnitude of inverse GH shift for TM and TE polarized light.

improve the transit parameters. Photometry provided accurate magnitude
differences between the stars and a measure of their rotation periods. The iron
abundance of XO-2N was found to be +0.054 dex greater, within more than
3-sigma, than that of XO-2S. We confirm a long-term variation in the radial
velocities of XO-2N, and we detected a turn-over with respect to previous
measurements. We suggest the presence of a second massive companion in an outer
orbit or the stellar activity cycle as possible causes of the observed
acceleration. The latter explanation seems more plausible with the present
dataset. We obtained an accurate value of the projected spin-orbit angle for
the XO-2N system (lambda=7+/-11 degrees), and estimated the real 3-D spin-orbit
angle (psi=27 +12/-27 degrees). We measured the XO-2 rotation periods, and
found a value of P=41.6 days in the case of XO-2N, in excellent agreement with
the predictions. The period of XO-2S appears shorter, with an ambiguity between
26 and 34.5 days that we cannot solve with the present dataset alone. XO-2N
appears to be more active than the companion, and this could be due to the fact
that we sampled different phases of their activity cycle, or to an interaction
between XO-2N and its hot Jupiter that we could not confirm.

is predicted to be around -0.09, originated from the hinge-like structure

Moreover, the cipher key for the AES algorithm is a sequence of 128, 192 or 256

parallel AES on the multiprocessor platform is presented. While most of the
previous designs either use pipelined parallelization or take advantage of the
Mix_Column parallelization, our design is based on combining pipelining of
rounds and parallelization of Mix_Column and Add_Round_Key transformations.
This model is divided into two levels: the first is pipelining different
rounds, while the second is through parallelization of both the Add_Round_Key
and the Mix_Column transformations. Previous work proposed for pipelining AES
algorithm was based on using nine stages, while, we propose the use of eleven
stages in order to exploit the sources of parallelism in both initial and final
round. This enhances the system performance compared to previous designs. Using
two-levels of parallelization benefits from the highly independency of
Add_Round_Key and Mix_Column/ Inv_Mix_Colum transformations. The analysis shows
that the parallel implementation of the AES achieves a better performance. The
analysis shows that using pipeline increases significantly the degree of
improvement for both encryption and decryption by approximately 95%. Moreover,
parallelizing Add_Round_Key and Mix_Column/ Inv_Mix_Column transformations
increases the degree of improvement by approximately 98%. This leads to the
conclusion that the proposed design is scalable and is suitable for real-time

TWRC (Two-Way Relay Channel) operated on the principle of PNC, there are many
other PNC building blocks--building blocks are simple small network structures
that can be used to construct a large network. In some of these PNC building
blocks, receivers can obtain side information through overhearing. Although
such overheard information is not the target information that the receivers
desire, the receivers can exploit the overheard information together with a
network-coded packet received to obtain a desired native packet. This leads to
throughput gain. Our previous study, however, assumed what is sent always get
received. In practice, that is not the case. Error control is needed to ensure
reliable communication. This paper focuses on the use of ARQ to ensure reliable

exploitation make the ARQ design of a network-coded system different from that
of a non-network-coded system. In this paper, we lay out the fundamental
considerations for such ARQ design: 1) We address how to track the stored coded

derive the throughput gain achieved by tracking 2) We investigate two

catalyse the reduction of O2- into hydrogen peroxide. Three different classes
of SOR have been reported on the basis of the presence or not of an additional
N-terminal domain. They all share a similar active site, with an unusual
non-heme Fe atom coordinated by four equatorial histidines and one axial
cysteine residues. Crucial catalytic reaction intermediates of SOR are
purported to be Fe(3+)-(hydro)peroxo species. Using resonance Raman
spectroscopy, we compared the vibrational properties of the Fe3+ active site of
two different classes of SOR, from Desulfoarculus baarsii and Treponema
pallidum, along with their ferrocyanide and their peroxo complexes. In both
species, rapid treatment with H2O2 results in the stabilization of a side-on
high spin Fe(3+)-(eta(2)-OO) peroxo species. Comparison of these two peroxo
species reveals significant differences in vibrational frequencies and bond
strengths of the Fe-O2 (weaker) and O-O (stronger) bonds for the T. pallidum
enzyme. Thus, the two peroxo adducts in these two SORs have different
stabilities which are also seen to be correlated with differences in the Fe-S
coordination strengths as gauged by the Fe-S vibrational frequencies. This was
interpreted from structural variations in the two active sites, resulting in
differences in the electron donating properties of the trans cysteine ligand.
Our results suggest that the structural differences observed in the active site
of different classes of SORs should be a determining factor for the rate of
release of the iron-peroxo intermediate during enzymatic turnover.

Further, we shall see that if the above kernel A is a regular ring, then A is
actually a polynomial ring over k; in particular, by the Quillen-Suslin

formation of transient intermediates different from those observed for SOR
alone. A one-electron redox chemistry appears to be carried out by the

expressed in an Escherichia coli sodA sodB recA mutant strain. Altogether,
these data describe an unprecedented O(2)(-.) detoxification activity,
catalyzed by the SOR-ferrocyanide complex, which does not conduct to the

redshift range between 0.75 and 1 and characterised by 2-10 keV intrinsic
luminosities in the QSO regime (e.g. well in excess to 1.0E44 cgs). We did not

correlation of Planck data and the WHIM template with a signal-to-noise from
0.84 to 1.39 at the different Planck frequencies, and with a frequency
dependence compatible with the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. When we
restrict our analysis to the 60% of the sky outside the plane of the Galaxy and
known point sources and galaxy clusters, the cross-correlation at zero lag is
0.064 +/- 0.051 muK. The correlation extends out to ~6 deg, which at the median
depth of our template corresponds to a physical length of ~ 6-8 Mpc/h. On the
same fraction of the sky, the cross-correlation of the CMB data with the second

evidence of a contribution from bound gas to the previous result. This limit
translates into a physical constraint on the properties of the shock-heated

find that our upper limit is compatible with a fraction of 45% of all baryons

literature, the mathematical expression of handover rate has been derived for

heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs). Recently, stochastic geometry modeling
has been shown to model well the real deployment of HCNs and has been
extensively used to analyze HCNs. In this paper, we give an effective handover
analysis for HCNs by stochastic geometry modeling, derive the mathematical
expression of handover rate by employing an infinitesimal method for a
generalized multi-tier scenario, discuss the result by deriving some meaningful
corollaries, and validate the analysis by computer simulation with multiple
walking models. By our analysis, we find that in HCNs the handover rate is
related to many factors like the base stations' densities and transmitting
powers, user's velocity distribution, bias factor, pass loss factor and etc.
Although our analysis focuses on the scenario of multi-tier HCNs, the
analytical framework can be easily extended for more complex scenarios, and may
shed some light for future study.

lengths ($\le$ 200 $\mu$m). These characteristics hinder their use in some
applications such as cavity quantum electrodynamics with trapped ions. We
optimized the laser machining process to produce large, uniform surface
structures. This enables the cavities to achieve high finesse even for long
cavity lengths. By rotating the fibers around their axis during the laser
machining process the asymmetry resulting from the laser's transverse mode
profile is eliminated. Consequently we are able to fabricate fiber mirrors with
a high degree of rotational symmetry, leading to remarkably low birefringence.
Through measurements of the cavity finesse over a range of cavity lengths and
the polarization dependence of the cavity linewidth, we confirmed the quality
of the produced fiber mirrors for use in low-birefringence FFPCs.

valuable in deciphering and understanding the intricate organisation of

interaction networks are context-less, i.e. without any reference to the
spatial, temporal or physiological conditions in which the interactions may
occur. In this work, we are proposing a protocol to infer the most likely
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in human macrophages. Results: We
integrated the PPI dataset from the Agile Protein Interaction DataAnalyzer
(APID) with different meta-data to infer a contextualized macrophage-specific
interactome using a combination of statistical methods. The obtained
interactome is enriched in experimentally verified interactions and in proteins
involved in macrophage-related biological processes (i.e. immune response
activation, regulation of apoptosis). As a case study, we used the
contextualized interactome to highlight the cellular processes induced upon
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Conclusion: Our work confirms that
contextualizing interactomes improves the biological significance of
bioinformatic analyses. More specifically, studying such inferred network
rather than focusing at the gene expression level only, is informative on the
processes involved in the host response. Indeed, important immune features such
as apoptosis are solely highlighted when the spotlight is on the protein
interaction level.

setting allowing one to emphasize the role of long-range interactions while
maintaining full analytical transparency. Our model can be viewed as a
description of a parallel bundle of N bistable units confined between two
shared rigid backbones that are loaded through a series spring. We show that
the ground states in this model correspond to synchronized, single phase
configurations where all individual units are either folded or unfolded. We
then study the fine structure of the wiggly energy landscape along the reaction
coordinate linking the two coherent states and describing the optimal mechanism
of cooperative unfolding. Quite remarkably, our study shows the fundamental
difference in the size and structure of the folding-unfolding energy barriers
in the hard (fixed displacements) and soft (fixed forces) loading devices which
persists in the continuum limit. We argue that both, the synchronization and
the non-equivalence of the mechanical responses in hard and soft devices, have
their origin in the dominance of long-range interactions. We then apply our
minimal model to skeletal muscles where the power-stroke in acto-myosin
crossbridges can be interpreted as passive folding. A quantitative analysis of
the muscle model shows that the relative rigidity of myosin backbone provides
the long-range interaction mechanism allowing the system to effectively
synchronize the power-stroke in individual crossbridges even in the presence of
thermal fluctuations. In view of the prototypical nature of the proposed model,
our general conclusions pertain to a variety of other biological systems where
elastic interactions are mediated by effective backbones.

the presence of high magnetic fields. The use of low background x-ray detectors
is an essential component contributing to the sensitivity of these searches. In
this work, we review the recent advances on Micromegas detectors used in the
CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) and proposed for the future International
Axion Observatory (IAXO). The actual setup in CAST has achieved background
levels below 10$^{-6}$ keV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, a factor 100 lower than
the first generation of Micromegas detectors. This reduction is based on active
and passive shielding techniques, the selection of radiopure materials, offline
discrimination techniques and the high granularity of the readout. We describe
in detail the background model of the detector, based on its operation at CAST
site and at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC), as well as on Geant4
simulations. The best levels currently achieved at LSC are low than 10$^{-7}$
keV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and show good prospects for the application of
this technology in IAXO. Finally, we present some ideas and results for
reducing the energy threshold of these detectors below 1 keV, using
high-transparent windows, autotrigger electronics and studying the cluster
shape at different energies. As a high flux of axion-like-particles is expected
in this energy range, a sub-keV threshold detector could enlarge the physics
case of axion helioscopes.

The mechanism of the transfer of reduced FMN between ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 has
been investigated. Dissociation constant values for oxidized and reduced flavin

The data clearly demonstrate a thermodynamic transfer of FMNred from ActVB to
ActVA-ORF5 without involving a particular interaction between the two protein
components. In full agreement with these data, we propose a reaction mechanism
in which FMNox binds to ActVB, where it is reduced, and the resulting FMNred
moves to ActVA-ORF5, where it reacts with O2 to generate a flavinperoxide
intermediate. A direct spectroscopic evidence for the formation of such species
within ActVA-ORF5 is reported.

inter-spike intervals (ISI) occurring during the progression of status
epilepticus (SE), so that the emergence of critical states could be reasonably
hypothesized as being part of the intrinsic nature of the SE. Methods. Status
epilepticus was induced by pilocarpine administration in post-natal 21-day rats
(n=8). For each animal, 24 hours of EEG from the onset of the SE were analyzed
according to the analytical procedure suggested by Clauset et al. (2009) which
combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics and likelihood ratios. The analytical
procedure was implemented by the freely available R software package
""poweRlaw"". Time of calculations was considerably shorten by the exploitation
of High-Throughput Computing technology, a.k.a. Grid Computing technology.
Results. The progression of the SE is characterized by the emergence of
power-law correlations of ISI whose likelihood of occurrence increases the more
the time from the onset of the SE elapses. Log-normal distribution of ISI is
however widely represented. Additionally, undetermined distributions of ISI are
represented as well, although confined within a restricted temporal window. The
final stage of SE appears dominated only by power-law and log-normal
distributions of ISI. Significance. The emergence of power-law correlations of
ISI concretely supports the concept of the occurrence of critical states during
the progression of SE. It is reasonably speculated, as a working hypothesis,
that the occurrence of power-law distributions of ISI within the early stages
of the SE could be a hallmark of the establishment of the route to
epileptogenesis.

resulting in remarkably affected coincidence rates. We also find that the
precision of the clock synchronization is sensitive to the source parameters

KOI-614b at the transition between what is usually referred to as ""hot"" and

decades, the frictional forces measured for ring-polymer brushes are half the

the weak inter-digitation of two ring brushes compared to linear brushes also
leads to a lower number of binary collisions between the monomers of opposing
brushes. At high velocities, where the thickness of the inter-digitation layer
between two opposing brushes is on the order monomer size regardless of brush
topology, stretched segments of ring polymers take a double-stranded
conformation. As a result, monomers of the double-stranded segments collide
less with the monomers of the opposing ring brush even though a similar number
of monomers occupies the inter-digitation layer for ring and linear-brush
bilayers. The numerical data obtained from our simulations is consistent with
the proposed scaling analysis. Conformation-dependent frictional reduction

Due to the nonlinear nature of contact forces, special care has to be taken in
the construction of numerical schemes for simulation and sound synthesis.
Finite difference schemes and other time-stepping algorithms used for musical
instrument modelling purposes are normally arrived at by discretising a
Newtonian description of the system. However because impact forces are
non-analytic functions of the phase space variables, algorithm stability can
rarely be established this way. This paper presents a systematic approach to
deriving energy conserving schemes for frictionless impact modelling. The
proposed numerical formulations follow from discretising Hamilton's equations
of motion, generally leading to an implicit system of nonlinear equations that
can be solved with Newton's method. The approach is first outlined for point
mass collisions and then extended to distributed settings, such as vibrating
strings and beams colliding with rigid obstacles. Stability and other relevant
properties of the proposed approach are discussed and further demonstrated with
simulation examples. The methodology is exemplified through a case study on
tanpura string vibration, with the results confirming the main findings of
previous studies on the role of the bridge in sound generation with this type
of string instrument.

show that the introduction of artificial petal-shaped corrugation in the

Chromo Dynamics (QCD) phase diagram is presented. The behavior of the Polyakov
loop close to the critical temperature is studied in terms of the color fields
inside the clusters of overlapping strings, which are produced in high energy
hadronic collisions. The non-Abelian nature of the color fields implies an
enhancement of the transverse momentum and a suppression of the multiplicities
relative to the non overlapping case. The prediction of this framework are
compared with experimental results from the SPS, RHIC and LHC for $pp$ and AA
collisions.
  Rapidity distributions, probability distributions of transverse momentum and
multiplicities, Bose-Einstein correlations, elliptic flow and ridge structures
are used to evaluate these comparison. The thermodynamical quantities, the
temperature, and energy density derived from RHIC and LHC data and Color String
Percolation Model (CSPM) are used to obtain the shear viscosity to entropy
density ratio ($\eta/s$). It was observed that the inverse of ($\eta/s$)
represents the trace anomaly $\Delta =(\varepsilon-3P)/T^{4}$. Thus the
percolation approach within CSPM can be successfully used to describe the
initial stages in high energy heavy ion collisions in the soft region in high
energy heavy ion collisions. The thermodynamical quantities, temperature and
the equation of state are in agreement with the lattice QCD calculations. Thus
the clustering of color sources has a clear physical basis although it cannot

that a characteristic structure appears in the neutrino mass matrix: two-zero
texture form which predicts three non-zero neutrino masses and three non-zero
CP-phases from five well measured experimental inputs of two squared mass
differences and three mixing angles. Furthermore, it is clarified that only the
inverted mass hierarchy is allowed in our model. In a favored parameter set
from the neutrino sector, the discrepancy in the muon anomalous magnetic moment

explained by the additional neutral gauge boson loop contribution with mass of

rotational evolution of the Crab pulsar. The pulsar is spun down by a
combination of magnetic dipole radiation and particle wind. The parameters of
the Crab pulsar, including magnetic field, inclination angle, and particle
density are calculated. The primary particle density in acceleration region is
about 10^3 times the Goldreich-Julian charge density. The lower braking index
between glitches is due to a larger outflowing particle density. This may be
glitch induced magnetospheric activities in normal pulsars. Evolution of
braking index and the Crab pulsar in P-Pdot diagram are calculated. The Crab
pulsar will evolve from magnetic dipole radiation dominated case towards
particle wind dominated case. Considering the effect of pulsar ""death"", the
Crab pulsar (and other normal pulsars) will not evolve to the cluster of
magnetars but downwards to the death valley. Different acceleration models are
also considered. Applications to other sources are also discussed, including

subjected to (1) periodic driving force of equal amplitude but different
driving frequencies and (2) different amount of damping. The simulation aims to
create a visually intuitive way of understanding how the series of amplitude
versus driving frequency graphs are obtained by showing how the displacement of
the system changes over time as it transits from the transient to the steady
state.
  A suggested how to use the model is added to help educators and students in
their teaching and learning, where we explained the theoretical steady state
equation, time conditions when the model starts allowing data recording of
maximum amplitudes to closely match the theoretical equation and steps to
collect different runs of degree of damping. We also discuss two design
features in our computer model: A) displaying the instantaneous oscillation
together with the achieved steady state amplitudes and B) explicit world view
overlay with scientific representation with different degrees of damping runs.

Images and a catalog containing 946,432 sources are available through the FIRST

history, including hardware and software changes that affect the catalog's
reliability and completeness. We use recent JVLA observations to test the
survey astrometry and flux bias/scale. Our sidelobe-flagging algorithm finds
that fewer than 10% of the catalogued objects are likely sidelobes; these are
faint sources concentrated near bright sources, as expected. A match with the
NRAO VLA Sky Survey shows very good consistency in flux scale and astrometry.
Matches with 2MASS and SDSS indicate a systematic 10-20mas astrometric error
with respect to the optical reference frame in old VLA data that has
disappeared with the advent of the JVLA. We demonstrate strikingly different
behavior between the radio matches to stellar objects and to galaxies in the
optical and IR surveys reflecting the different radio populations present over
the flux density range 1-1000 mJy. As the radio flux density declines, quasars
get redder and fainter, while galaxies get brighter and have colors that
initially redden but then turn bluer near the FIRST detection limit.
  Implications for future radio sky surveys are also discussed. In particular,
we show that for radio source identification at faint optical magnitudes, high
angular resolution observations are essential, and cannot be sacrificed in
exchange for high signal-to-noise data. The value of a JVLA survey as a
complement to SKA precursor surveys is briefly discussed.

for testing and comparing galaxy evolution models, since it allows us to make
unbiased comparisons between the predicted and observed distributions of galaxy

effects.
  Our semi-empirical models populate each dark matter halo with a galaxy of
determined stellar mass and scale radius. We compute the luminosity and
spectrum of each simulated galaxy from its evolving stellar mass using stellar
population synthesis models. We calculate the intrinsic scatter in the stellar
mass-halo mass relation that naturally results from enforcing a monotonically
increasing stellar mass along the merger history of each halo. The simulated
galaxy images are drawn from cutouts of real galaxies from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey, with sizes and fluxes rescaled to match those of the model
galaxies.
  The distributions of galaxy luminosities, sizes, and surface brightnesses
depend on the adjustable parameters in the models, and they agree well with
observations for reasonable values of those parameters. Measured galaxy
magnitudes and sizes have significant magnitude-dependent biases, with both
being underestimated near the magnitude detection limit. The fraction of
galaxies detected and fraction of light detected also depend sensitively on the
details of the model.

and gauge-invariant combination of SU(2) gauge bosons. A pair of Higgs bosons
is identified with pairs of gauge bosons by setting their mass Lagrangians
equal to each other. That immediately determines the mass of the composite
Higgs boson. It becomes simply half of the vacuum expectation value of the
standard Higgs boson, which matches the observed mass with tree-level accuracy
(2%). The two parameters of the standard Higgs potential are replaced by five
one-loop self-interactions of the SU(2) gauge bosons, derived from the
fundamental gauge couplings. The Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism of spontaneous
symmetry breaking is generalized from scalars to vectors. Their transverse
components acquire finite vacuum expectation values which generate masses for
both gauge bosons and the Higgs boson. This concept leads beyond the standard
model by enabling calculations of the Higgs mass and its potential without
adjustable parameters. It can be applied to non-abelian gauge theories in
general, such as grand unified models and supersymmetry.

Modeller, a tool that supports Communication Analysis, a communication-oriented
business process modelling method. GREAT allows creating communicative event
diagrams (i.e. business process models), specifying message structures (which
describe the messages associated to each communicative event), and
automatically generating a class diagram (representing the data model of an
information system that would support such organisational communication). This
report briefly describes the methodological background of the tool. This
handbook explains the modelling techniques in detail: Espa\~na, S., A.

  Come?","21 pages",,"10.5506/APhysPolB.47.1011",,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We argue that one has to distinguish between the Harari-Shupe model (HSM) and
the Harari-Shupe observation (HSO). The former - in which quarks and leptons
are viewed as composite objects built from confined fermionic subparticles
(`rishons') - is known to be beset with many difficulties. The latter may be
roughly defined as this part of the HSM that really works. We recall that the
phase-space Clifford-algebra approach leads to the HSO without any of the HSM
problems and discuss in some detail how this is achieved. The light which the
phase-space-based view sheds on the HSO sets then a new direction along which
the connection between space and particle properties could be studied and
offers a glimpse into weird physics that probably lurks much deeper than the
field-theoretical approach of the Standard Model.

  simulation",,,,,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.CB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop, analyse and numerically simulate a model of a prototype,
glucose-driven, rhythmic drug delivery device, aimed at hormone therapies, and
based on chemomechanical interaction in a polyelectrolyte gel membrane. The
pH-driven interactions trigger volume phase transitions between the swollen and
collapsed states of the gel.For a robust set of material parameters, we find a
class of solutions of the governing system that oscillate between such states,
and cause the membrane to rhythmically swell, allowing for transport of the
drug, fuel and reaction products across it, and collapse, hampering all
transport across it. The frequency of the oscillations can be adjusted so that
it matches the natural frequency of the hormone to be released. The work is
linked to extensive laboratory experimental studies of the device built by
Siegel's team. The thinness of the membrane and its clamped boundary, together
with the homogeneously held conditions in the experimental apparatus, justify
neglecting spatial dependence on the fields of the problem. Upon identifying
the forces and energy relevant to the system, and taking into account its
dissipative properties, we apply Rayleigh's variational principle to obtain the
governing equations. The material assumptions guarantee the monotonicity of the
system and lead to the existence of a three dimensional limit cycle. By scaling
and asymptotic analysis, this limit cycle is found to be related to a
two-dimensional one that encodes the volume phase transitions of the model. The
identification of the relevant parameter set of the model is aided by a Hopf
bifurcation study of steady state solutions.
