  using placement with simple linear functions",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We estimate the size of a most loaded bin in the setting when the balls are
placed into the bins using a random linear function in a finite field. The
balls are chosen from a transformed interval. We show that in this setting the
expected load of the most loaded bins is constant.
  This is an interesting fact because using fully random hash functions with
the same class of input sets leads to an expectation of $\Theta\left(\frac{\log
m}{\log \log m}\right)$ balls in most loaded bins where $m$ is the number of
balls and bins.
  Although the family of the functions is quite common the size of largest bins
was not known even in this simple case.

moduli. We first consider a robust reconstruction problem for polynomials from
erroneous residues when the degrees of all residue errors are assumed small,
namely robust Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for polynomials. It basically
says that a polynomial can be reconstructed from erroneous residues such that
the degree of the reconstruction error is upper bounded by $\tau$ whenever the
degrees of all residue errors are upper bounded by $\tau$, where a sufficient
condition for $\tau$ and a reconstruction algorithm are obtained. By releasing
the constraint that all residue errors have small degrees, another robust
reconstruction is then presented when there are multiple unrestricted errors
and an arbitrary number of errors with small degrees in the residues. By making
full use of redundancy in moduli, we obtain a stronger residue error correction
capability in the sense that apart from the number of errors that can be
corrected in the previous existing result, some errors with small degrees can
be also corrected in the residues. With this newly obtained result,
improvements in uncorrected error probability and burst error correction
capability in a data transmission are illustrated.

split into several pieces which are randomly routed to specific servers in the
network, without centralized information about the status of the servers'
individual queues. The main feature of this system is that the different pieces

system operates in a FCFS basis. The synchronization and service discipline
create blocking and idleness among the servers, which is compensated by the

the stationary waiting time distribution of jobs under a many servers limit and

bridge the temporal gap between long-term system optimization and real-time

compromising system efficiency and stability. The design of the controllers is
grounded on a dual epsilon-subgradient method, and semidefinite programming
relaxations are advocated to bypass the non-convexity of AC OPF formulations.
Global convergence of inverter output powers is analytically established for
diminishing stepsize rules and strictly convex OPF costs for cases where: i)
computational limits dictate asynchronous updates of the controller signals,
and ii) inverter reference inputs may be updated at a faster rate than the
power-output settling time. Although the focus is on PV systems, the framework
naturally accommodates different types of inverter-interfaced energy resources.

the non-uniform sampling regime. In particular, if the sampling distribution
aligns with the underlying matrix's leverage scores, then with high probability
nuclear norm minimization will exactly recover the low rank matrix. In this
article, we analyze the scenario in which the non-uniform sampling distribution
may or may not not align with the underlying matrix's leverage scores. Here we
explore learning the parameters for weighted nuclear norm minimization in terms
of the empirical sampling distribution. We provide a sufficiency condition for
these learned weights which provide an exact recovery guarantee for weighted
nuclear norm minimization. It has been established that a specific choice of
weights in terms of the true sampling distribution not only allows for weighted
nuclear norm minimization to exactly recover the low rank matrix, but also
allows for a quantifiable relaxation in the exact recovery conditions. In this
article we extend this quantifiable relaxation in exact recovery conditions for
a specific choice of weights defined analogously in terms of the empirical
distribution as opposed to the true sampling distribution. To accomplish this
we employ a concentration of measure bound and a large deviation bound. We also
present numerical evidence for the healthy robustness of the weighted nuclear
norm minimization algorithm to the choice of empirically learned weights. These
numerical experiments show that for a variety of easily computable empirical
weights, weighted nuclear norm minimization outperforms unweighted nuclear norm
minimization in the non-uniform sampling regime.

Intriguingly, superconductivity in the observed pressure and temperature range

questions about this remarkable result, however, are left unanswered: (1) Does
the stoichiometry of the superconducting compound differ from the nominal

physical origin of the anomalously high critical temperature related only to
the high H phonon frequencies, or does strong electron-ion coupling play a

decomposing into H$_3$S and S, and that H$_3$S has a record high $T_c$ due to
its covalent bonds driven metallic. The main reason for this extraordinarily
high $T_c$ in H$_3$S as compared with MgB$_2$, another compound with a similar

preferences for recommendation and to approximate missing data. Instead of
using low-rank factorization we take a drastically different approach, based on
the simple insight that an additive model of co-clusterings allows one to
approximate matrices efficiently. This allows us to build a concise model that,
per bit of model learned, significantly beats all factorization approaches to
matrix approximation. Even more surprisingly, we find that summing over small
co-clusterings is more effective in modeling matrices than classic
co-clustering, which uses just one large partitioning of the matrix.
  Following Occam's razor principle suggests that the simple structure induced
by our model better captures the latent preferences and decision making
processes present in the real world than classic co-clustering or matrix
factorization. We provide an iterative minimization algorithm, a collapsed
Gibbs sampler, theoretical guarantees for matrix approximation, and excellent
empirical evidence for the efficacy of our approach. We achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Netflix problem with a fraction of the model

aggregation feature. Alternatively, the Small Cell Forum introduced the
Integrated Femto-WiFi (IFW) small cell which simultaneously accesses both the
licensed band (via cellular interface) and the unlicensed band (via WiFi
interface). In this paper, a practical algorithm for IFW and DBF to
automatically balance their traffic in licensed and unlicensed bands, based on
the real-time channel, interference and traffic conditions of both bands is
described. The algorithm considers the fact that some ""smart"" devices
(sDevices) have both cellular and WiFi radios while some WiFi-only devices
(wDevices) may only have WiFi radio. In addition, the algorithm considers a
realistic scenario where a single small cell user may simultaneously use
multiple sDevices and wDevices via either the IFW, or the DBF in conjunction
with a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). The goal is to maximize the total
user satisfaction/utility of the small cell user, while keeping the
interference from small cell to macrocell below predefined thresholds. The
algorithm can be implemented at the Radio Link Control (RLC) or the network
layer of the IFW and DBF small cell base stations. Results demonstrate that the
proposed traffic-balancing algorithm applied to either IFW or DBF significantly
increases sum utility of all macrocell and small cell users, compared with the
current practices. Finally, various implementation issues of IFW and DBF are

process (IBP) introduced by Griffiths and Ghahramani [GG05]. By reinterpreting
the beta process introduced by Hjort [Hjo90] as a measurable family of
Dirichlet processes, we obtain a simple predictive rule for the general case,
which can be thought of as a continuum of Blackwell-MacQueen urn schemes (or
equivalently, one-parameter Hoppe urn schemes). The corresponding measurable
family of Perman-Pitman-Yor processes leads to a continuum of two-parameter
Hoppe urn schemes, whose ordinary component is the three-parameter IBP
introduced by Teh and G\""or\""ur [TG09], which exhibits power-law behavior, as
further studied by Broderick, Jordan, and Pitman [BJP12]. The idea extends to
arbitrary measurable families of exchangeable partition probability functions
and gives rise to generalizations of the beta process with matching buffet

  Heterogeneous Networks","Infocom",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the problem of optimal request routing and content caching in
a heterogeneous network supporting in-network content caching with the goal of
minimizing average content access delay. Here, content can either be accessed
directly from a back-end server (where content resides permanently) or be
obtained from one of multiple in-network caches. To access a piece of content,
a user must decide whether to route its request to a cache or to the back-end
server. Additionally, caches must decide which content to cache. We investigate
the problem complexity of two problem formulations, where the direct path to
the back-end server is modeled as i) a congestion-sensitive or ii) a
congestion-insensitive path, reflecting whether or not the delay of the
uncached path to the back-end server depends on the user request load,
respectively. We show that the problem is NP-complete in both cases. We prove
that under the congestion-insensitive model the problem can be solved optimally
in polynomial time if each piece of content is requested by only one user, or
when there are at most two caches in the network. We also identify a structural
property of the user-cache graph that potentially makes the problem
NP-complete. For the congestion-sensitive model, we prove that the problem
remains NP-complete even if there is only one cache in the network and each
content is requested by only one user. We show that approximate solutions can
be found for both models within a (1-1/e) factor of the optimal solution, and
demonstrate a greedy algorithm that is found to be within 1% of optimal for
small problem sizes. Through trace-driven simulations we evaluate the
performance of our greedy algorithms, which show up to a 50% reduction in
average delay over solutions based on LRU content caching.

and other areas. It is widely used to measure the amount of information and
calculate the lower bound for the variance for maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE). In practice, we do not always know the actual FIM. This is often because
obtaining the first or second-order derivatives of the log-likelihood function
is difficult, or simply because the calculation of FIM is too formidable. In
such cases, we need to utilize the approximation of FIM. In general, there are
two ways to estimate FIM. One is to use the product of gradient and the
transpose of itself, and the other is to calculate the Hessian matrix and then
take negative sign. Mostly people use the latter method in practice. However,
this is not necessarily the optimal way. To find out which of the two methods
is better, we need to conduct a theoretical study to compare their efficiency.
In this paper we mainly focus on the case where the unknown parameter that
needs to be estimated by MLE is scalar and the random variables we have are
independent. In this scenario, Fisher information matrix is virtually Fisher
information number (FIN). Using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), we get
asymptotic variances for the two methods, by which we compare their accuracy.
Taylor expansion assists in estimating the two asymptotic variances. A
numerical study is provided as an illustration of the conclusion. The next is a
summary of limitations of this paper. We also enumerate several fields of
interest for future study in the end of this paper.

this additional degree of freedom was a magnetic flux confined to a solenoid,

either only dealt with specific cases, or was limited to spaces with finite

algebraic-topological object is oriented towards general paths. This makes it a
more natural choice for the path integral approach than the more commonly known
fundamental group, which is restricted to loops. Using this object, we provide
a method that works for spaces with infinite fundamental groups. We adapt a
tool used in the previous, restricted result, in order to clearly delineate
physically significant degrees of freedom from gauge freedom. This allows us to
explicitly build phases which take account of symmetries of the space, directly

status of the theory of the elementary particles in the electroweak range (up
to about 300 GeV). What general conclusions can be inferred from the Standard
Model? It looks that the Standard Model teaches us that in the framework of
such general principles as local gauge symmetry, unification of weak and
electromagnetic interactions and Brout-Englert-Higgs spontaneous breaking of
the electroweak symmetry nature chooses the simplest possibilities.
Two-component left-handed massless neutrino fields play crucial role in the
determination of the charged current structure of the Standard Model. The
absence of the right-handed neutrino fields in the Standard Model is the
simplest, most economical possibility. In such a scenario Majorana mass term is
the only possibility for neutrinos to be massive and mixed. Such mass term is
generated by the lepton-number violating Weinberg effective Lagrangian. In this
approach three Majorana neutrino masses are suppressed with respect to the
masses of other fundamental fermions by the ratio of the electroweak scale and
a scale of a lepton-number violating physics. The discovery of the neutrinoless
double $\beta$-decay and absence of transitions of flavor neutrinos into
sterile states would be evidence in favor of the minimal scenario we advocate

introduce a condition called the normal extension property (NEP) and establish
a one-to-one correspondence between CP instruments with the NEP and statistical
equivalence classes of measuring processes. We show that every CP instrument on
an atomic von Neumann algebra has the NEP, extending the well-known result for
type I factors. Moreover, we show that every CP instrument on an injective von
Neumann algebra is approximated by CP instruments with the NEP. The concept of
posterior states is also discussed to show that the NEP is equivalent to the
existence of a strongly measurable family of posterior states for every normal
state. Two examples of CP instruments without the NEP are obtained from this
result. It is thus concluded that in local quantum physics not every CP
instrument represents a measuring process, but in most of physically relevant
cases every CP instrument can be realized by a measuring process within
arbitrary error limits, as every approximately finite dimensional (AFD) von
Neumann algebra on a separable Hilbert space is injective. To conclude the
paper, the concept of local measurement in algebraic quantum field theory is
examined in our framework. In the setting of the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts and
Doplicher-Roberts (DHR-DR) theory describing local excitations, we show that an

The image resolution is around 1.25 mm using ML-EM reconstruction algorithm.
B73 inbred maize seeds were germinated and then grown in a sealed jar with
transparent gel-based media. PET scanning started on the day when the first
green leaf appeared, and was carried out once a day for 5 days. Each morning,
around 10 mCi of 11CO2 was administrated into a custom built plant labeling
chamber. After 10 minutes, residual activity was flushed out with fresh air
before a 2-h PET scan started. For the OPT imaging, the jar was placed inside
an acrylic cubic container filled with water, illuminated with a uniform
surface light source, and imaged by a DSLR camera from 72 angles to acquire
optical images for OPT reconstruction. The same plant was imaged 3 times a day
by the OPT system. Plant roots growth is measured from the optical images.
Co-registered PET and optical images indicate that most of the hot spots
appeared in later time points of the PET images correspond to the most actively
growing root tips. The strong linear correlation between 11C allocation at root
tips measured by PET and eventual root growth measured by OPT suggests that we
can use PET as a phenotyping tool to measure how a plant makes subterranean

squares variance grows slower or faster than that in a Gaussian process have
found many applications. At a macroscopic level, these processes are adequately
described by fractional differential equations, which involves fractional
derivatives in time or/and space. The fractional derivatives describe either
history mechanism or long range interactions of particle motions at a
microscopic level. The new physics can change dramatically the behavior of the
forward problems. Naturally one expects that the new physics will impact
related inverse problems in terms of uniqueness, stability, and degree of
ill-posedness. The last aspect is especially important from a practical point
of view, i.e., stably reconstructing the quantities of interest.
  In this paper, we employ a formal analytic and numerical way to examine the
degree of ill-posedness of several ""classical"" inverse problems for fractional
differential equations involving a Djrbashian-Caputo fractional derivative in
either time or space, which represent the fractional analogues of that for
classical integral order differential equations. We discuss four inverse
problems, i.e., backward fractional diffusion, sideways problem, inverse source
problem and inverse potential problem for time fractional diffusion, and
inverse Sturm-Liouville problem, Cauchy problem, backward fractional diffusion
and sideways problem for space fractional diffusion. It is found that contrary
to the wide belief, the influence of anomalous diffusion on the degree of
ill-posedness is not definitive: it can either significantly improve or worsen
the conditioning of related inverse problems, depending crucially on the
specific type of given data and quantity of interest. Further, the study
exhibits distinct new features of ""fractional"" inverse problems.

of a solar magnetic flux tube of axial symmetry is developed by specifying a
magnetic flux and deriving general analytical formulae for the equilibrium mass
density and a gas pressure. The main advantage of this model is that it can be
easily adopted to any axisymmetric magnetic structure. The model is used to
simulate numerically the propagation of nonlinear Alfv\'en waves in such 2D
flux tubes of axial symmetry embedded in the solar atmosphere. The waves are
excited by a localized pulse in the azimuthal component of velocity and
launched at the top of the solar photosphere, and they propagate through the
solar chromosphere, transition region, and into the solar corona. Results: The
results of our numerical simulations reveal a complex scenario of twisted
magnetic field lines and flows associated with torsional Alfv\'en waves as well
as energy transfer to the magnetoacoustic waves that are triggered by the
Alfv\'en waves and are akin to the vertical jet flows. Alfv\'en waves
experience about 5 % amplitude reflection at the transition region. Magnetic

agreement with analytical findings. Kinetic energy of magnetoacoustic waves
consists of 25 % of the total energy of Alfv\'en waves. The energy transfer may
lead to localized mass transport in the form of vertical jets, as well as to
localized heating as slow magnetoacoustic waves are prone to dissipation in the

$\alpha\in(0,1)$ in time arises in a wide variety of practical applications,
and it is often adopted to model anomalous subdiffusion processes in
heterogeneous media. The L1 scheme is one of the most popular and successful
numerical methods for discretizing the Caputo fractional derivative in time.
The scheme was analyzed earlier independently by Lin and Xu (2007) and Sun and
Wu (2006), and an $O(\tau^{2-\alpha})$ convergence rate was established, under
the assumption that the solution is twice continuously differentiable in time.
However, in view of the smoothing property of the subdiffusion equation, this
regularity condition is restrictive, since it does not hold even for the
homogeneous problem with a smooth initial data. In this work, we revisit the
error analysis of the scheme, and establish an $O(\tau)$ convergence rate for
both smooth and nonsmooth initial data. The analysis is valid for more general
sectorial operators. In particular, the L1 scheme is applied to one-dimensional
space-time fractional diffusion equations, which involves also a
Riemann-Liouville derivative of order $\beta\in(3/2,2)$ in space, and error
estimates are provided for the fully discrete scheme. Numerical experiments are

two different choices of Laplacians in $n$-dimensional, $\kappa$-deformed
Euclidean space-time. We use an approach where the deformed Laplacians are
expressed in the commutative space-time itself. Using the perturbative
solutions to diffusion equations, we calculate the spectral dimension of
$\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it decreases as the probe length
decreases. By introducing a bound on the deformation parameter, spectral
dimension is guaranteed to be positive definite. We find that, for one of the
choices of the Laplacian, the non-commutative correction to the spectral
dimension depends on the topological dimension of the space-time whereas for
the other, it is independent of the topological dimension. We have also
analysed the dimensional flow for the case where the probe particle has a

analytics packages that are increasingly used in Big Data applications.
Identifying the optimal model parameters is a time-consuming process that has
to be executed from scratch for every dataset/model combination even by
experienced data scientists. We argue that the incapacity to evaluate multiple
parameter configurations simultaneously and the lack of support to quickly
identify sub-optimal configurations are the principal causes. In this paper, we
develop two database-inspired techniques for efficient model calibration.
Speculative parameter testing applies advanced parallel multi-query processing
methods to evaluate several configurations concurrently. The number of
configurations is determined adaptively at runtime, while the configurations
themselves are extracted from a distribution that is continuously learned
following a Bayesian process. Online aggregation is applied to identify
sub-optimal configurations early in the processing by incrementally sampling
the training dataset and estimating the objective function corresponding to
each configuration. We design concurrent online aggregation estimators and
define halting conditions to accurately and timely stop the execution. We apply
the proposed techniques to distributed gradient descent optimization -- batch
and incremental -- for support vector machines and logistic regression models.
We implement the resulting solutions in GLADE PF-OLA -- a state-of-the-art Big
Data analytics system -- and evaluate their performance over terascale-size
synthetic and real datasets. The results confirm that as many as 32
configurations can be evaluated concurrently almost as fast as one, while
sub-optimal configurations are detected accurately in as little as a
$1/20^{\text{th}}$ fraction of the time.

  The number of essential variables is an important measure of complexity for

  When replacing some variables in a function with constants the resulting
functions are called subfunctions, and when replacing all essential variables
in a function with constants we obtain an implementation of this function.
  Such an implementation corresponds with a path in an ordered decision diagram
(ODD) of the function which connects the root with a leaf of the diagram. The
sets of essential variables in subfunctions of $f$ are called separable in $f$.
In this paper we study several properties of separable sets of variables in
functions which directly impact on the number of implementations and
subfunctions in these functions.
  We define equivalence relations which classify the functions of $k$-valued
logic into classes with same number of implementations, subfunctions or
separable sets. These relations induce three transformation groups which are
compared with the lattice of all subgroups of restricted affine group (RAG).

forming in an isolated galactic disk simulation that includes both localised
thermal feedback and photoelectric heating. The results are compared with the
three previous simulations in this series which consists of a model with no
star formation, star formation but no form of feedback and star formation with
photoelectric heating in a set with steadily increasing physical effects. We
find that the addition of localised thermal feedback greatly suppresses star
formation but does not destroy the surrounding GMC, giving cloud properties
closely resembling the run in which no stellar physics is included. The
outflows from the feedback reduce the mass of the cloud but do not destroy it,
allowing the cloud to survive its stellar children. This suggests that weak
thermal feedback such as the lower bound expected for supernova may play a
relatively minor role in the galactic structure of quiescent Milky Way-type
galaxies, compared to gravitational interactions and disk shear.

testing the General theory of Relativity and alternative gravity theories (see
Wex (2014) for a recent review). Timing a pulsar in orbit around a companion,
provides a unique way of probing the relativistic dynamics and spacetime of
such a system. The strictest tests of gravity, in strong field conditions, are
expected to come from a pulsar orbiting a black hole. In this sense, a pulsar
in a close orbit ($P_{\rm orb}$ < 1 yr) around our nearest supermassive black
hole candidate, Sagittarius A* - at a distance of ~8.3 kpc in the Galactic
centre (Gillessen et al. 2009a) - would be the ideal tool. Given the size of
the orbit and the relativistic effects associated with it, even a slowly
spinning pulsar would allow the black hole spacetime to be explored in great
detail (Liu et al. 2012). For example, measurement of the frame dragging caused
by the rotation of the supermassive black hole, would allow a test of the
""cosmic censorship conjecture."" The ""no-hair theorem"" can be tested by
measuring the quadrupole moment of the black hole. These are two of the prime
examples for the fundamental studies of gravity one could do with a pulsar

by reinterpreting the original axioms of Euclid. The basic concept is still
that of a line segment but its equivalent notion of betweenness is viewed as a
topological, not a metric concept. That leads quickly to the notion of
connectedness without any need to dwell on the definition of topology. In our
approach line segments must be connected. Lines and planes are unified via the
concept of separation: lines are separated into two components by each point,
planes contain lines that separate them into two components as well. We add a
subgroup of bijections preserving line segments and establishing unique
isomorphism of basic geometrical sets, and the axiomatic structure is complete.
Of fundamental importance is the Fixed Point Theorem that allows for creation
of the concepts of length and congruency of line segments. The resulting
structure is much more in sync with modern science than other axiomatic
approaches to planar geometry. For instance, it leads naturally to the Erlangen
Program in geometry. Our Conditions of Homogeneity and Rigidity have two
interpretations. In physics, they correspond to the basic tenet that
independent observers should arrive at the same measurement and are related to
boosts in special relativity. In geometry, they mean uniqueness of congruence
for certain geometrical figures.
  Another thread of the paper is the introduction of boundary at infinity, an
important concept of modern mathematics, and linking of Pasch Axiom to endowing
boundaries at infinity with a natural relation of betweenness. That way
spherical geometry can be viewed as geometry of boundaries at infinity.

an antiferromagnetic transition at 1.1 K with a possibility of another magnetic
transition near 0.18 K. The heat capacity shows a sharp lambda-type anomaly at
1.1 K in zero-filed, which broadens and moves to higher temperature in applied
magnetic field. Our zero-field muSR and ND measurements confirm the existence
of a long-range magnetic ground state below 1.2 K. Further the ND study reveals
an incommensurate magnetic ordering with a magnetic propagation vector k = (0,
0, 0.52) and a spiral structure of Ce moments coupled ferromagnetically within
the ab-plane. Our INS study reveals the presence of two well-defined crystal
electric field (CEF) excitations at 5.1 meV and 24.6 meV in the paramagnetic
phase of CeAuAl3 which can be explained on the basis of the CEF theory.
Furthermore, low energy quasi-elastic excitations show a Gaussian line shape
below 30 K compared to a Lorentzian line shape above 30 K, indicating a
slowdown of spin fluctuation below 30 K. We have estimated a Kondo temperature
of TK=3.5 K from the quasi-elastic linewidth, which is in good agreement with
that estimated from the heat capacity. This study also indicates the absence of
any CEF-phonon coupling unlike that observed in isostructural CeCuAl3. The CEF
