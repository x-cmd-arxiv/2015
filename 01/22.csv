transport on all length and time scales is needed to further enable scientific
insight and technology innovation. Using a simplified form of the Boltzmann
transport equation (BTE), originally developed for electron transport, we
demonstrate how ballistic phonon effects and finite-velocity propagation are
easily and naturally captured. We show how this approach compares well to the
phonon BTE, and readily handles a full phonon dispersion and energy-dependent
mean-free-path. This study of transient heat transport shows i) how fundamental
temperature jumps at the contacts depend simply on the ballistic thermal
resistance, ii) that phonon transport at early times approach the ballistic
limit in samples of any length, and iii) perceived reductions in heat
conduction, when ballistic effects are present, originate from reductions in
temperature gradient. Importantly, this framework can be recast exactly as the
Cattaneo and hyperbolic heat equations, and we discuss how the key to capturing
ballistic heat effects is to use the correct physical boundary conditions.

total coronal energy budget are elevated. Using observations from the {\it
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly} and {\it Heliosemic Magnetic Imager} on board the
{\it Solar Dynamics Observatory}, and numerical model extrapolations of coronal
magnetic fields, we investigate a dynamic QS transient energetically isolated
to the TR and extruding from a common footpoint shared with two heated loop
arcades. A non-casual relationship is established between episodic heating of
the QS transient and wide-spread magnetic field re-organization events, while
evidence is found favoring a magnetic topology typical of eruptive processes.
Quasi-steady interchange reconnection events are implicated as a source of the
transient's visibly bright radiative signature. We consider the QS transient's
temporally stable ($\approx$\,35\,min) radiative nature occurs as a result of
the large-scale magnetic field geometries of the QS and/or relatively quiet
nature of the magnetic photosphere, which possibly act to inhibit energetic
buildup processes required to initiate a catastrophic eruption phase. This work
provides insight to the QS's thermodynamic and magnetic relation to eruptive
processes quasi-steadily heating a small-scale dynamic and TR transient. This
work elevates arguments of non-negligible coronal heating contributions from
cool atmospheric layers in QS conditions, and increases evidence for solar wind

mobility protocols. Current proposed schemes such as Hierarchical Mobile IPv6
(HMIPv6) and more importantly Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) provide localized
mobility support by electing a node within the network (topologically close to
the Access Routers (AR)) to act as mobility anchor. Such schemes can
significantly improve handover latency, as well as the end-to-end signalling
overhead, but might entail scalability issues, which in some instances, do not
fit adequately with the current explosion of mobile Internet traffic, and the
evolutionary trend towards flat network architectures. The notion of using
Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) allows for decentralization by anchoring
nodes at their AR. The idea is that for sessions with duration less than the
cell residence time efficient mobility can be supported. However, DMM might be
highly suboptimal in instances where nodes perform multiple handovers during
the session lifetime. Hence, one approach cannot be effective for all types of
applications. In this paper a hybrid mobility management solution, integrated
with a new routing scheme, is proposed. The scheme selects the most suitable
mobility approach, centralized or distributed, by taking into account the
flows' requirement, in terms of Quality of Experience (QoE), and new routing
constraints. The results of optimization problem show that the proposed
approach can achieve efficient resource utilisation, ease network congestion,
and lead to a significant improvement in the QoE.

candidates for the Sibling category, but due to the long period of orbit
evolution since the break-up of the birth cluster of the Sun, one can only
attach probabilities of membership. We find that up to 10% (but more likely
around 1 %) of the members of the Sun's birth cluster could be still found
within 100 pc from the Sun today.

ecotoxicological threat of contaminant to biodiversity. It predicts safe
concentrations for a contaminant in a community. Widely used, this approach
suffers from several drawbacks: i)summarizing the sensitivity of each species
by a single value entails a loss of valuable information about the other
parameters characterizing the concentration-effect curves; ii)it does not
propagate the uncertainty on the critical effect concentration into the SSD;
iii)the hazardous concentration estimated with SSD only indicates the threat to
biodiversity, without any insight about a global response of the community
related to the measured endpoint. We revisited the current SSD approach to
account for all the sources of variability and uncertainty into the prediction
and to assess a global response for the community. For this purpose, we built a
global hierarchical model including the concentration-response model together
with the distribution law for the SSD. Working within a Bayesian framework, we
were able to compute an SSD taking into account all the uncertainty from the
original raw data. From model simulations, it is also possible to extract a
quantitative indicator of a global response of the community to the
contaminant. We applied this methodology to study the toxicity of 6 herbicides
to benthic diatoms from Lake Geneva, measured from biomass reduction.

sense and discriminate was a direct consequence of the extended {\pi} system of

different charge distribution of the five PBI derivatives, which leads to a
unique electrical response to analyte binding.

Substitutional carbon and nitrogen are found to have a magnetic moment of 2 and
1$\mu{_B}$, respectively, with a tendency for anti-ferromagnetic long range
order. For C/N on interstitial sites we find that carbon is non-magnetic while
nitrogen always possesses a magnetic moment of 1$\mu{_B}$. We find that these
interstitial positions are on a saddle point of the total energy. The stable
configuration is reached when both carbon and nitrogen form a C-O and N-O dimer
with a bond length close to the double bond for CO and NO. This result is in
agreement with earlier experimental investigations detecting such N-O entities
from XPS measurements. The frequencies of the symmetric stretching mode are
calculated for these dimers, which could provide a means for experimental
verification. For all configurations investigated both C and N states are found
inside the TiO${_2}$ gap. These new electronic states are discussed with

of kink oscillations, from here on the ""period ratio"", is a seismology tool
that can be used to infer information about the spatial variation of density
along solar magnetic flux tubes. The period ratio is 2 in longitudinally
homogeneous thin tubes, but it differs from 2 due to longitudinal
inhomogeneity. In this paper we investigate the period ratio in longitudinally
inhomogeneous prominence threads and explore its implications for prominence
seismology. We numerically solve the two-dimensional eigenvalue problem of kink
oscillations in a model of a prominence thread. We take into account three
nonuniform density profiles along the thread. In agreement with previous works
that used simple piecewise constant density profiles, we find that the period
ratio is larger than 2 in prominence threads. When the ratio of the central
density to that at the footpoints is fixed, the period ratio depends strongly
on the form of the density profile along the thread. The more concentrated the
dense prominence plasma near the center of the tube, the larger the period
ratio. However, the period ratio is found to be independent of the specific
density profile when the spatially averaged density in the thread is the same
for all the profiles. An empirical fit of the dependence of the period ratio on
the average density is given and its use for prominence seismology is
discussed.

significant improvement in efficiency. Second, the row (resp. column) echelon

present a general relation between Hall viscosity and susceptibility for

challenge: to take uncertainties into account when dealing with complex

from the joint effort of several industrial companies and academic
institutions. EDF R&D, Airbus Group and Phimeca Engineering started a
collaboration at the beginning of 2005, joined by IMACS in 2014, for the
development of an Open Source software platform dedicated to uncertainty
propagation by probabilistic methods, named OpenTURNS for Open source Treatment
of Uncertainty, Risk 'N Statistics. OpenTURNS addresses the specific industrial
challenges attached to uncertainties, which are transparency, genericity,
modularity and multi-accessibility. This paper focuses on OpenTURNS and
presents its main features: openTURNS is an open source software under the LGPL
license, that presents itself as a C++ library and a Python TUI, and which
works under Linux and Windows environment. All the methodological tools are
described in the different sections of this paper: uncertainty quantification,
uncertainty propagation, sensitivity analysis and metamodeling. A section also
explains the generic wrappers way to link openTURNS to any external code. The
paper illustrates as much as possible the methodological tools on an
educational example that simulates the height of a river and compares it to the
height of a dyke that protects industrial facilities. At last, it gives an
overview of the main developments planned for the next few years.

this paper, 2 $\times$ 10$^8$ s of data accumulated between 2003 and 2013 are
used to perform a dedicated analysis, aiming to deeply investigate the spatial
morphology of the $^{26}$Al emission. The data are first compared with several
sky maps based on observations at various wavelengths to model the $^{26}$Al

inner Galaxy flux is compatible with a value of 3.3$\times$ 10$^{-4}$
ph.cm$^{-2}$.s$^{-1}$ while the preferred template maps correspond to young
stellar components such as core-collapse supernovae, Wolf-Rayet and massive AGB
stars. To get more details about this emission, an image reconstruction is
performed using an algorithm based on the maximum-entropy method. In addition
to the inner Galaxy emission, several excesses suggest that some sites of
emission are linked to the spiral arms structure. Lastly, an estimation of the
$^{60}$Fe line flux, assuming a spatial distribution similar to $^{26}$Al line
emission, results in a $^{60}$Fe\ to $^{26}$Al ratio around 0.14, which agrees
with the most recent studies and with the SN explosion model predictions.

composition of the interstellar medium and provide fundamental data about
element abundances that constrain models of galactic chemical evolution.
Discrepancies that still exist between observed emission line strengths and
those predicted by nebular models can be partly attributed to the spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) of the sources of ionizing radiation used in the
models as well as simplifying assumptions made in nebular modeling. The
influence of stellar metallicity on nebular line strength ratios, via its
effect on the SEDs, is of similar importance as variations in the nebular
metallicity. We have computed a grid of model atmosphere SEDs for massive and
very massive O-type stars covering a range of metallicities from significantly
subsolar (0.1 Zsun) to supersolar (2 Zsun). The SEDs have been computed using a
state-of-the-art model atmosphere code that takes into account the attenuation
of the ionizing flux by the spectral lines of all important elements and the
hydrodynamics of the radiatively driven winds and their influence on the SEDs.
For the assessment of the SEDs in nebular simulations we have developed a
(heretofore not available) 3d radiative transfer code that includes a
time-dependent treatment of the metal ionization. Using the SEDs in both 1d and
3d nebular models we explore the relative influence of stellar metallicity, gas
metallicity, and inhomogeneity of the gas on the nebular ionization structure
and emission line strengths. We find that stellar and gas metallicity are of
similar importance for establishing the line strength ratios commonly used in
nebular diagnostics, whereas inhomogeneity of the gas has only a subordinate
influence on the global line emission.

inputs (and outputs) exercising a set of execution paths within a program to be
tested. If the paths cover a sufficient part of the code under test, the test
data offer a representative view of the program's actual behaviour, which
notably enables detecting errors and correcting faults. Relational databases
are ubiquitous in software, but symbolic execution of pieces of code that
manipulate them remains a non-trivial problem, particularly because of the
complex structure of such databases and the complex behaviour of SQL
statements. In this work, we define a direct symbolic execution for database
manipulation code and integrate it with a more traditional symbolic execution
of normal program code. The database tables are represented by relational
symbols and the SQL statements by relational constraints over these symbols and
the symbols representing the normal variables of the program. An algorithm
based on these principles is presented for the symbolic execution of Java
methods that implement business use cases by reading and writing in a
relational database, the latter subject to data integrity constraints. The
algorithm is integrated in a test generation tool and experimented over sample
code. The target language for the constraints produced by the tool is the
SMT-Lib standard and the used solver is Microsoft Z3. The results show that the
proposed approach enables generating meaningful test data, including valid
database content, in reasonable time. In particular, the Z3 solver is shown to
be more scalable than the Alloy solver, used in our previous work, for solving
relational constraints.

influence of a short-range attractive interaction between monomers, at various
ambient temperature values. In the high temperature limit the homopolymer chain
is in the self-avoiding random walk phase. But at low temperatures, two
different phases are possible: When short-range attractive interactions
dominate over chirality, the chain collapses into a space- filling
conformation. But when the attractive interactions become weaker, there is a
low temperature unfolding transition and the chain becomes like a straight rod.
Between the high temperature and low temperature limits, several intermediate
states are observed. For sufficiently high values of short-range attraction,
the conventional {\theta}-regime is observed between the self-avoiding random
walk phase and the space filling collapsed phase. But when chirality increases,
there is a trasition from the {\theta}-regime to a pseudogap state. Moreover, a
regime akin the {\theta}-regime is identified between the pseudogap state, and
the low temperature phase where the chain is like a straight rod. Applications
to polymers and proteins, in particular collagen, are suggested.

chains with heavy-tailed distributions of persistence length, polymers adsorbed
to the surface and the chains driven by a noise with power-law spatial
correlations. Further, we derive the distribution of segments around the mass

such as zonal jets and coherent vortices. One of the simplest models that
retains the relevant dynamics of turbulent self-organization is a barotropic
flow in a beta-plane channel with turbulence sustained by random stirring.
Non-linear integrations of this model show that as the energy input rate of the
forcing is increased, the homogeneity of the flow is first broken by the
emergence of non-zonal, coherent, westward propagating structures and at larger
energy input rates by the emergence of zonal jets. The emergence of both
non-zonal coherent structures and zonal jets is studied using a statistical
theory, Stochastic Structural Stability Theory (S3T). S3T directly models a
second-order approximation to the statistical mean turbulent state and allows
the identification of statistical turbulent equilibria and study of their
stability. Using S3T, the bifurcation properties of the homogeneous state in
barotropic beta-plane turbulence are determined. Analytic expressions for the
zonal and non-zonal large-scale coherent flows that emerge as a result of
structural instability are obtained and the equilibration of the incipient
instabilities is studied through numerical integrations of the S3T dynamical
system. The dynamics underlying the formation of zonal jets are also
investigated. It is shown that zonal jets form from the upgradient momentum
fluxes that result from the shearing of the eddies by the emerging
infinitesimal large-scale flow. Finally, numerical simulations of the nonlinear
equations confirm the characteristics (scale, amplitude and phase speed) of the
structures predicted by S3T, even in highly non-linear parameter regimes such

the approximately invariant manifold introduced by Alikakos, Chen and Fusco for
the deterministic problem. In the stochastic case depending on the scaling, the
motion is driven by the change in the curvature of the boundary and the
stochastic forcing. Moreover, under the assumption of a sufficiently small
noise strength, we establish stochastic stability of a neighborhood of the
manifold of droplets in $L^2$ and $H^1$, which means that with overwhelming
probability the solution stays close to the manifold for very long time-scales.

this thesis we propose a synthesis method for encoding and managing large-scale
deterministic scientific hypotheses as uncertain and probabilistic data.
  In the form of mathematical equations, hypotheses symmetrically relate
aspects of the studied phenomena. For computing predictions, however,
deterministic hypotheses can be abstracted as functions. We build upon Simon's
notion of structural equations in order to efficiently extract the (so-called)
causal ordering between variables, implicit in a hypothesis structure (set of
mathematical equations).
  We show how to process the hypothesis predictive structure effectively
through original algorithms for encoding it into a set of functional
dependencies (fd's) and then performing causal reasoning in terms of acyclic
pseudo-transitive reasoning over fd's. Such reasoning reveals important causal
dependencies implicit in the hypothesis predictive data and guide our synthesis
of a probabilistic database. Like in the field of graphical models in AI, such
a probabilistic database should be normalized so that the uncertainty arisen
from competing hypotheses is decomposed into factors and propagated properly
onto predictive data by recovering its joint probability distribution through a
lossless join. That is motivated as a design-theoretic principle for
data-driven hypothesis management and predictive analytics.
  The method is applicable to both quantitative and qualitative deterministic
hypotheses and demonstrated in realistic use cases from computational science.

electronic properties of semiconductor materials. To the best of our knowledge,
the current models following the framework of the Boltzmann transport equation
(BTE) either rely heavily on experimental data (i.e., semi-empirical), or
utilize simplifying assumptions, such as the constant relaxation time
approximation (BTE-cRTA). While these models offer valuable physical insights
and accurate calculations of transport properties in some cases, they often
lack sufficient accuracy -- particularly in capturing the correct trends with
temperature and carrier concentration. We present here a general transport
model for calculating low-field electrical drift mobility and Seebeck
coefficient of n-type semiconductors, by explicitly considering all relevant
physical phenomena (i.e. elastic and inelastic scattering mechanisms). We first
rewrite expressions for the rates of elastic scattering mechanisms, in terms of
ab initio properties, such as the band structure, density of states, and polar
optical phonon frequency. We then solve the linear BTE to obtain the
perturbation to the electron distribution -- resulting from the dominant
scattering mechanisms -- and use this to calculate the overall mobility and
Seebeck coefficient. Using our model, we accurately calculate electrical
transport properties of the compound n-type semiconductors, GaAs and InN, over
various ranges of temperature and carrier concentration. Our fully predictive
model provides high accuracy when compared to experimental measurements on both
GaAs and InN, and vastly outperforms both semi-empirical models and the
BTE-cRTA. Therefore, we assert that this approach represents a first step
towards a fully ab initio carrier transport model that is valid in all compound
semiconductors.

II radio galaxies, while the extended radio luminosities are intermediate

7.6 GHz reveal parsec-scale jet structures, in two cases with extended

this alignment, the ratio of the radio core luminosity to the optical
luminosity, the jet/counter-jet intensity and extension length ratios, and
moderate core brightness temperatures ($\lesssim10^{10}$ K), we conclude these
jets are mildly relativistic ($\beta\lesssim0.3$, $\delta\sim1$-$1.5$) and
aligned at moderately small angles to the line of sight (10-15$^{\circ}$). The
derived kinematic ages of $\sim10^6$-$10^7$ y are much younger than radio

and distributed star-formation. However, a large component of the young stellar

no evidence for the B10 conclusion that such dense regions form an extreme
""tail"" of the distribution. Tables of intrinsic populations for these regions

particular low-luminosity hard-spectrum nearby sources like BL Lacs, are
responsible for most of the EGB emission above 100\,GeV. We find that the
extragalactic background light, which attenuates blazars' high-energy emission,
is responsible for the high-energy cut-off observed in the EGB spectrum.
Finally, we show that blazars, star-forming galaxies and radio galaxies can
naturally account for the amplitude and spectral shape of the background in the

allows us to set competitive constraints on the dark-matter annihilation cross

Changes in the geometry and energetics of the corona that give rise to this
variability are inferred through measurements of the relativistically blurred
reflection seen from the accretion disc. On long timescales, we find that
during the high flux epochs the corona has expanded, covering the inner regions
of the accretion disc out to a radius of 26(-7,+10)rg. The corona contracts to
within 12rg and 5rg in the intermediate and low flux epochs, respectively.
While the earlier high flux observation made in 2006 is consistent with a
corona extending over the inner part of the accretion disc, a later high flux
observation that year revealed that the X-ray source had become collimated into
a vertically-extended jet-like corona and suggested relativistic motion of
material upward. On short timescales, we find that an X-ray flare during a low
flux epoch in 2013 corresponded to a reconfiguration from a slightly extended
corona to one much more compact, within just 2~3rg of the black hole. There is
evidence that during the flare itself, the spectrum softened and the corona
became collimated and slightly extended vertically as if a jet-launching event
was aborted. Understanding the evolution of the X-ray emitting corona may
reveal the underlying mechanism by which the luminous X-ray sources in AGN are
powered.

augmenting the SCMS algorithm with bootstrap-based methods of uncertainty
estimation allows one to place uncertainty bands around putative filaments. We
apply the SCMS method to datasets sampled from the P3M N-body simulation, with
galaxy number densities consistent with SDSS and WFIRST-AFTA and to LOWZ and

in the initial production of an extended debris stream that winds repeatedly

self-intersect. Both analytical work and simulations have shown that typical
encounters generate streams that are extremely thin. In this paper we show that
this implies that even small relativistic precessions attributed to black hole
spin can induce deflections that prevent the stream from self-intersecting even
after many windings. Additionally, hydrodynamical simulations have demonstrated
that energy is deposited very slowly via hydrodynamic processes alone,
resulting in the liberation of very little gravitational binding energy in the
absence of stream-stream collisions. This naturally leads to a ""dark period"" in
which the flare is not observable for some time, persisting for up to a dozen
orbital periods of the most bound material, which translates to years for
disruptions around black holes with mass $\sim 10^{7} M_{\odot}$. We find that
more-massive black holes tend to have more violent stream self-intersections,
resulting in short viscous times that lead to prompt accretion onto the black
hole. For these tidal disruption events (TDEs), the accretion rate onto the
black hole should still closely follow the original fallback rate after a fixed
delay time $t_{\rm delay}$. For lower black hole masses ($M_{\rm h} \lesssim
10^{6}$), we find that flares are typically slowed down by about an order of
magnitude, and because the accretion rates for TDEs about higher-mass black
hole are already sub-Eddington, this results in the majority of TDEs being
sub-Eddington at peak. This also implies that current searches for TDEs are
biased towards prompt flares, with slowed flares likely having been
unidentified. [abridged]

establishes that shocks and relativistic particle acceleration are key features
of these events. These shocks are likely to be radiative due to the high
densities of the nova ejecta at early times coincident with the gamma-ray
emission. Thermal X-rays radiated behind the shock are absorbed by neutral gas
and reprocessed into optical emission, similar to Type IIn (interacting)
supernovae. Gamma-rays are produced by collisions between relativistic protons
with the nova ejecta (hadronic scenario) or Inverse Compton/bremsstrahlung
emission from relativistic electrons (leptonic scenario), where in both
scenarios the efficiency for converting relativistic particle energy into LAT
gamma-rays is at most a few tens of per cent. The ratio of gamma-ray and
optical luminosities, L_gam/L_opt, thus sets a lower limit on the fraction of
the shock power used to accelerate relativistic particles, e_nth. The measured
values of L_gam/L_opt for two classical novae, V1324 Sco and V339 Del,
constrains e_nth > 1e-2 and > 1e-3, respectively. Inverse Compton models for
the gamma-ray emission are disfavored given the low electron acceleration
efficiency, e_nth ~ 1e-4-1e-3, inferred from observations of Galactic cosmic
rays and particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations. A fraction >
100(0.01/e_nth) and > 10(0.01/e_nth) per cent of the optical luminosity is
powered by shocks in V1324 Sco and V339 Del, respectively. Such high fractions
challenge standard models that instead attribute all nova optical emission to
the direct outwards transport of thermal energy released near the white dwarf
surface.

likely power source for the Lyman-alpha nebula. In contrast to previous

factor of $\sim$10, and at low surface brightness levels the Lyman-alpha

suggestive of a physical association. At the same time, we confirm that there
is no compact continuum source located within $\sim$2-3""$\approx$15-23 kpc of
the Lyman-alpha peak. Since the latest cold accretion simulations predict that
the brightest Lyman-alpha emission will be coincident with a central growing
galaxy, we conclude that this is actually a strong argument against, rather
than for, the idea that the nebula is gravitationally-powered. While we may be
seeing gas within cosmic filaments, this gas is primarily being lit up, not by
gravitational energy, but due to illumination from a nearby buried AGN.

optical Wolf-Rayet (WR) emission lines that reveal a large evolved massive star
population. We find that S26 is host to $\sim$240 massive stars, of which
$\sim$18 are Wolf-Rayet stars; the relative populations are roughly consistent
with other observed massive star forming clusters and galaxies. We construct
SEDs over two spatial scales (roughly 100 pc and 300 pc) that clearly exhibit
warm dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission. The best fit dust
and grain models reveal that both the intensity of the exciting radiation and
PAH grain destruction increase toward the cluster center. Given that the
timescale of evacuation is important for the future dynamical evolution of the
cluster, it is important to determine whether O- and WR stars can evacuate the
material gradually before supernova do so on a much faster timescale. With a
minimum age of $\approx$ 3 Myr, it is clear that S26 has not yet fully
evacuated its natal material, which indicates that unevolved O-type stars alone
do not provide sufficient feedback to remove the gas and dust. We hypothesize
that the feedback of WR stars in this cluster may be necessary for clearing the
material from the gravitational potential of the cluster. We find S26 is
similar to Emission Line Clusters observed in the Antennae Galaxies and may be
considered a younger analog to 30 Doradus in the LMC.

system is difficult to reconcile with a bottom-up formation scenario due to the
observed scarcity of objects smaller than $\sim$100 km in size. Instead,
planetesimals appear to form top-down, with large $100-1000$ km bodies forming
from the rapid gravitational collapse of dense clumps of small solid particles.
In this paper we investigate the conditions under which solid particles can
form dense clumps in a protoplanetary disk. We use a hydrodynamic code to model
the interaction between solid particles and the gas inside a shearing box
inside the disk, considering particle sizes from sub-millimeter-sized
chondrules to meter-sized rocks. We find that particles down to millimeter
sizes can form dense particle clouds through the run-away convergence of radial
drift known as the streaming instability. We make a map of the range of
conditions (strength of turbulence, particle mass-loading, disk mass, and
distance to the star) which are prone to producing dense particle clumps.
Finally, we estimate the distribution of collision speeds between mm-sized
particles. We calculate the rate of sticking collisions and obtain a robust
upper limit on the particle growth timescale of $\sim$$10^5$ years. This means
that mm-sized chondrule aggregates can grow on a timescale much smaller than
the disk accretion timescale ($\sim$$10^6 - 10^7$ years). Our results suggest a
pathway from the mm-sized grains found in primitive meteorites to fully formed
asteroids. We speculate that asteroids may form from a positive feedback loop
in which coagualation leads to particle clumping driven by the streaming
instability. This clumping, in turn reduces collision speeds and enhances
coagulation.} Future simulations should model coagulation and the streaming
instability together to explore this feedback loop further.

of a composite order parameter fluctuating between 2$p_F$-charge ordering and
superconducting (SC) pairing. In the limit of linear dispersion and at the
hotspots, both order parameters are related by a SU(2) symmetry and the eight
hotspot model of Efetov $\textit{et al.}$ [Nat. Phys. $\bf{9}$, 442 (2013)] is
recovered. In the general case however, curvature terms of the dispersion will
break this symmetry and the degeneracy between both states is lifted. Taking
the full momentum dependence of the order parameter into account, we measure
the strength of this SU(2) symmetry breaking over the full Brillouin zone. For
realistic dispersion relations including curvature we find generically that the
SU(2) symmetry breaking is small and robust to the fermiology and that the
symmetric situation is restored in the large paramagnon mass and coupling
limit. Comparing the level splitting for different materials we propose a
scenario that could account for the competition between the PG and the SC
states in the phase diagram of high-$T_c$ superconductors.

Friedman-Goldfarb-Harrington (FGH) theorem says that over elementary

generalizations of the FGH theorem. In particular, for $n>1$ we relate
$\Sigma_{n}$ formulas to provability statements $[n]_T^{\sf True}\varphi$ which
are a formalization of ""provable in $T$ together with all true $\Sigma_{n+1}$

$\Sigma_{n+1}$-complete. This observation yields us to consider a recursively
defined hierarchy of provability predicates $[n+1]^\Box_T$ which look a lot
like $[n+1]_T^{\sf True}$ except that where $[n+1]_T^{\sf True}$ calls upon the
oracle of all true $\Sigma_{n+2}$ sentences, the $[n+1]^\Box_T$ recursively
calls upon the oracle of all true sentences of the form $\langle n

its simultaneous observations by Chandra HETG/ACIS-S and RXTE/PCA as well as by
XMM-Newton EPIC-pn and RXTE/PCA, we quantify the degree of uncertainty in the

agree with each other within their formal uncertainties, increasing our
confidence in these flux measurements. In contrast, XMM-Newton EPIC-pn measures
14.0$\pm$0.3 % less flux than the RXTE/PCA. This is consistent with the
previously reported discrepancy with the flux measurements of EPIC-pn, compared
to EPIC-MOS1, MOS2 and ACIS-S detectors. We also show that any intrinsic time

Galerkin (IP-DG) method using piecewise linear polynomials for the elastic
Helmholtz equations with the first order absorbing boundary condition. It is
proved that the sesquilinear form for the problem satisfies a generalized weak
coercivity property, which immediately infers a stability estimate for the
solution of the differential problem in all frequency regimes. It is also
proved that the proposed IP-DG method is unconditionally stable with respect to
both frequency $\omega$ and mesh size $h$. Sub-optimal order (with respect to
$h$) error estimates in the broken $H^1$-norm and in the $L^2$-norm are
obtained in all mesh regimes. These estimate improve to optimal order when the
mesh size $h$ is restricted to the pre-asymptotic regime (i.e., $\omega^\beta h
=O(1)$ for some $1\leq \beta<2$). The novelties of the proposed IP-DG method
include: first, the method penalizes not only the jumps of the function values
across the element edges but also the jumps of the normal derivatives; second,
the penalty parameters are taken as complex numbers with positive imaginary
parts. In order to establish the desired unconditional stability estimate for
the numerical solution, the main idea is to exploit a (simple) property of
linear functions to overcome the main difficulty caused by non-Hermitian nature
and strong indefiniteness of the Helmholtz-type problem. The error estimate is
then derived using a nonstandard technique adapted from \cite{Feng_Wu09}.
Numerical experiments are also presented to validate the theoretical results
and to numerically examine the pollution effect (with respect to $\omega$) in
the error bounds.

GeV/$c^2$, normalized to the charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity, has
a value similar to that in In+In collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 17.3 GeV. For
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, the normalized excess yield in central collisions is
higher than that at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 17.3 GeV and increases from peripheral to

Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) observes dozens of the most stable millisecond

where our sensitivity to BWMs is best, we would detect mergers of binaries with
reduced masses of $10^9$ $M_\odot$ out to distances of 30 Mpc; such massive
mergers in the Virgo cluster would be marginally detectable. We find no
evidence for BWMs. However, with our non-detection, we set upper limits on the
rate at which BWMs of various amplitudes could have occurred during the time
spanned by our data--e.g., BWMs with amplitudes greater than $10^{-13}$ must
occur at a rate less than 1.5 yr$^{-1}$.

magnetic anisotropy that is large, and can be characterized by 5 real

(spherical) nano-grains, these parameters exhibit symmetrical structures and
reflect the symmetry of the underlying lattice, while for disordered grains
they are randomly distributed and, - for stronger disorder, - their

the probability of having small magnetic anisotropies $K_L$ is suppressed below
a characteristic scale $\Delta_E$, which we predict to scale with the number of

the deviation of the actual arrival time from the planned arrival time. Neither

this paper, we investigate ways to assess and forecast transport risks using a
half-year of air cargo data, provided by a leading forwarder on 1336 routes

strong multimodal feature in the transport risks, driven by unobserved events,

Bayesian nonparametric model -- the probit stick-breaking process (PSBP)
mixture model -- for flexible estimation of the conditional (i.e.,
state-dependent) density function of transport risk. We demonstrate that using
simpler methods, such as OLS linear regression, can lead to misleading
inferences. Our model provides a tool for the forwarder to offer customized
price and service quotes. It can also generate baseline airline performance to
enable fair supplier evaluation. Furthermore, the method allows us to separate
recurrent risks from disruption risks. This is important, because hedging
strategies for these two kinds of risks are often drastically different.

statistically independent incoherent classical light sources and measured in
the far field in spatially separated modes may display spatial correlations
akin to path-entanglement of photons produced by quantum sources. By measuring
higher order photon-correlations at different locations, i.e., $m$ photons in
one mode and one photon in another mode, we experimentally demonstrate for $m
\geq 6$ a violation of Bell-type inequalities for spatial degrees of freedom.
The spatial correlations among the photons can be understood from state
projection where the detection of the first $m$ photons projects the sources
onto a state which emits the subsequent photon in a strongly correlated manner.
From this perspective the entanglement and violation of Bell's inequalities
appears as a consequence of nonvanishing cross correlations between
noncommuting quadrature phase components of the two spatially separated fields
after $m$ photons have been recorded. In this way we show that classical
systems may produce spatial field correlations violating local realistic
theories.

high-dimensional feature vector to a vector of binary codes, for application to
fast image retrieval. This typically results in a difficult optimization
problem, nonconvex and nonsmooth, because of the discrete variables involved.
Much work has simply relaxed the problem during training, solving a continuous
optimization, and truncating the codes a posteriori. This gives reasonable
results but is quite suboptimal. Recent work has tried to optimize the
objective directly over the binary codes and achieved better results, but the
hash function was still learned a posteriori, which remains suboptimal. We
propose a general framework for learning hash functions using affinity-based
loss functions that uses auxiliary coordinates. This closes the loop and
optimizes jointly over the hash functions and the binary codes so that they
gradually match each other. The resulting algorithm can be seen as a corrected,
iterated version of the procedure of optimizing first over the codes and then
learning the hash function. Compared to this, our optimization is guaranteed to
obtain better hash functions while being not much slower, as demonstrated
experimentally in various supervised datasets. In addition, our framework
facilitates the design of optimization algorithms for arbitrary types of loss

In this paper we develop a new experimental multi-wavelength technique to
determine the beaming factor $\left( f_\Omega \right)$ dependance on spin-down
luminosity of a set of GeV pulsars. This technique requires three input
parameters: pulsar spin-down luminosity, pulsar phase-averaged GeV flux and TeV
or X-ray flux from the associated Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN). The analysis
presented in this paper uses the PWN TeV flux measurements to study the
correlation between $f_\Omega$ and $\dot{E}$. The measured correlation has some
features that favor the Outer Gap model over the Polar Cap, Slot Gap and One
Pole Caustic models for pulsar emission in the energy range of 0.1 to 100 GeV,
but one must keep in mind that these simulated models failed to explain many of
the most important pulsar population characteristics. A tight correlation
between the pulsar GeV emission and PWN TeV emission was also observed, which
suggests the possibility of a linear relationship between the two emission
mechanisms. In this paper we also discuss a possible mechanism to explain this

\S2--\S4) but also contains a main new result (in \S5), which we first
describe. Given $c \geq 0$, the spectral operator $\mathfrak{a} =
\mathfrak{a}_c$ can be thought of intuitively as the operator which sends the
geometry onto the spectrum of a fractal string of dimension not exceeding $c$.
Rigorously, it turns out to coincide with a suitable quantization of the
Riemann zeta function $\zeta = \zeta(s)$: $\mathfrak{a} = \zeta (\partial)$,
where $\partial = \partial_c$ is the infinitesimal shift of the real line
acting on the weighted Hilbert space $L^2 (\mathbb{R}, e^{-2ct} dt)$. In this
paper, we establish a new asymmetric criterion for the Riemann hypothesis,
expressed in terms of the invertibility of the spectral operator for all values
of the dimension parameter $c \in (0, 1/2)$ (i.e., for all $c$ in the left half
of the critical interval $(0,1)$). This corresponds (conditionally) to a
mathematical (and perhaps also, physical) ""phase transition"" occurring in the
midfractal case when $c= 1/2$. Both the universality and the non-universality
of $\zeta = \zeta (s)$ in the right (resp., left) critical strip $\{1/2 <
\text{Re}(s) < 1 \}$ (resp., $\{0 < \text{Re}(s) < 1/2 \}$) play a key role in
this context. These new results are presented in \S5. In \S2, we briefly
discuss earlier joint work on the complex dimensions of fractal strings, while
in \S3 and \S4, we survey earlier related work of the author with H. Maier and
with H. Herichi, respectively, in which were established symmetric criteria for
the Riemann hypothesis, expressed respectively in terms of a family of natural
inverse spectral problems for fractal strings of Minkowski dimension $D \in
(0,1),$ with $D \neq 1/2$, and of the quasi-invertibility of the family of
spectral operators $\mathfrak{a}_c$ (with $c \in (0,1), c \neq 1/2$).

knotted. We define four generalized moves based on the Reidemeister Moves.
These moves have the capability of untangling knots which must be made more
complicated before they can be simplified. With these moves, we construct a
computer program which reads the two-dimensional projection of a knot in its
Gauss Code notation and untangles it to the fewest possible number of
crossings. Due to the properties of the Gauss Code notation, the program runs
efficiently with minimal computation time, compared to currently existing
untangling programs. We have tested it on all possible Gauss Codes of up to 50

projection of each knot. The results are consistent with our predictions about

a transmit element and reflected from a target and possibly clutter, in the
presence of interference and noise. The receive sensors communicate over
non-ideal backhaul links with a fusion center, or cloud processor, where the
presence or absence of the target is determined. The backhaul architecture can
be characterized either by an orthogonal-access channel or by a non-orthogonal
multiple-access channel. Two backhaul transmission strategies are considered,
namely compress-and-forward (CF), which is well suited for the
orthogonal-access backhaul, and amplify-and-forward (AF), which leverages the
superposition property of the non-orthogonal multiple-access channel. In this
paper, the joint optimization of the sensing and backhaul communication
functions of the cloud radar system is studied. Specifically, the transmitted
waveform is jointly optimized with backhaul quantization in the case of CF
backhaul transmission and with the amplifying gains of the sensors for the AF
backhaul strategy. In both cases, the information-theoretic criterion of the
Bhattacharyya distance is adopted as a metric for the detection performance.
Algorithmic solutions based on successive convex approximation are developed
under different assumptions on the available channel state information (CSI).
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes outperform conventional
solutions that perform separate optimizations of the waveform and backhaul
operation, as well as the standard distributed detection approach.

three different linear processing schemes are investigated, namely, 1) Maximum

confirms the onset of the high energy eikonal regime in the scattering process

genuinely related to the short distance structure of the deuteron. Our
conclusion is that for the first time the deuteron is probed at relative

big data, which is proving to be useful in a number of applications. To deal
with explosively growing amounts of data, data analytics has emerged as a
critical technology related to computing, signal processing, and information
networking. In this paper, a formalism is considered in which data is modeled
as a generalized social network and communication theory and information theory
are thereby extended to data analytics. First, the creation of an equalizer to
optimize information transfer between two data variables is considered, and
financial data is used to demonstrate the advantages. Then, an information
coupling approach based on information geometry is applied for dimensionality
reduction, with a pattern recognition example to illustrate the effectiveness.
These initial trials suggest the potential of communication theoretic data
analytics for a wide range of applications.

modeled grain-scale stresses induced by diurnal temperature variations on
simple microstructures made of pyroxene and plagioclase on various solar system
bodies. We found that a heterogeneous microstructure on the Moon experiences
peak tensile stresses on the order of 100 MPa. The stresses induced are
controlled by the coefficient of thermal expansion and Young's modulus of the
mineral constituents, and the average stress within the microstructure is
determined by relative volume of each mineral. Amplification of stresses occurs
at surface-parallel boundaries between adjacent mineral grains and at the tips
of pore spaces. We also found that microscopic spatial and temporal surface
temperature gradients do not correlate with high stresses, making them
inappropriate proxies for investigating microcrack propagation. Although these

When field defects occur in both eyes and overlap, parts of the visual pathways
are no longer stimulated. Previous reports have shown that this affects the
grey matter of the primary visual cortex, but possible effects on the preceding
visual pathway structures have not been fully established. Method. In this
multicentre study, we used high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance
imaging and voxel-based morphometry to investigate the visual pathway
structures up to the primary visual cortex of patients with age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) and juvenile macular degeneration (JMD). Results. Compared
to age-matched healthy controls, in patients with JMD we found volumetric
reductions in the optic nerves, the chiasm, the lateral geniculate bodies, the
optic radiations and the visual cortex. In patients with AMD we found
volumetric reductions in the lateral geniculate bodies, the optic radiations
and the visual cortex. An unexpected finding was that AMD, but not JMD, was
associated with a reduction in frontal white matter volume. Conclusion. MD is
associated with degeneration of structures along the visual pathways. A
reduction in frontal white matter volume only present in the AMD patients may
constitute a neural correlate of previously reported association between AMD
and mild cognitive impairment.

numerical stability problems when the degree is large. We observe, however,
that such a difficulty disappears at the initial stage of the algorithms, and
in our present paper we extend this stage to root-finding within a nearly

initial isolation of the roots of the input polynomial has been ensured.
Furthermore our algorithm is nearly optimal for the approximation of the roots
isolated in a fixed disc, square or another region on the complex plane rather
than all complex roots of a polynomial. Moreover the algorithm can be applied
to a polynomial given by a black box for its evaluation (even if its
coefficients are not known); it promises to be of practical value for
polynomial root-finding and factorization, the latter task being of interest on
its own right. We also provide a new support for a winding number algorithm,

where bubbles continuously nucleate giving rise to observers in their interior.
In this paper, we point out that topological defects of several
dimensionalities will also be produced in de Sitter like regions of the
multiverse. In particular, defects could be spontaneously nucleated in our
parent vacuum. We study the evolution of these defects as they collide with and
propagate inside of our bubble. We estimate the present distribution of defects
in the observable part of the universe. The expected number of such nearby
defects turns out to be quite small, even for the highest nucleation rate. We
also study collisions of strings and domain walls with our bubble in our past
light cone. We obtain simulated full-sky maps of the loci of such collisions,
and find their angular size distribution. Similarly to what happens in the case
of bubble collisions, the prospect of detecting any collisions of our bubble
with ambient defects is greatly enhanced in the case where the cosmological
constant of our parent vacuum is much higher than the vacuum energy density
during inflation in our bubble.

institution repays its debts, is an important and sometimes contentious feature
of financial crises, yet its impact on system-wide stability is not well
understood. We capture seniority of debt in a multiplex network, a graph of
nodes connected by multiple types of edges. Here, an edge between banks denotes
a debt contract of a certain level of seniority. Next we study cascading
default. There exist multiple kinds of bankruptcy, indexed by the highest level
of seniority at which a bank cannot repay all its debts. Self-interested banks
would prefer that all their loans be made at the most senior level. However,
mixing debts of different seniority levels makes the system more stable, in
that it shrinks the set of network densities for which bankruptcies spread
widely. We compute the optimal ratio of senior to junior debts, which we call
the optimal seniority ratio, for two uncorrelated Erdos-Renyi networks. If
institutions erode their buffer against insolvency, then this optimal seniority
ratio rises; in other words, if default thresholds fall, then more loans should
be senior. We generalize the analytical results to arbitrarily many levels of
seniority and to heavy-tailed degree distributions.

7_{-2}-8_{-1} E (37.7~GHz) class II methanol transitions towards the centre of
the closest ultra-luminous infrared galaxy Arp 220. The emission in both the
methanol transitions show narrow spectral features and have luminosities
approximately 8 orders of magnitude stronger than that observed from typical
class I methanol masers observed in Galactic star formation regions. The
emission is also orders of magnitude stronger than the expected intensity of
thermal emission from these transitions and based on these findings we suggest
that the emission from the two transitions are masers. These observations
provides the first detection of a methanol megamaser in the 36.2 and 37.7 GHz
transitions and represents only the second detection of a methanol megamaser,
following the recent report of an 84 GHz methanol megamaser in NGC1068. We find
the methanol megamasers are significantly offset from the nuclear region and
arise towards regions where there is Ha emission, suggesting that it is
associated with starburst activity. The high degree of correlation between the
spatial distribution of the 36.2 GHz methanol and X-ray plume emission suggests
that the production of strong extragalactic class I methanol masers is related
to galactic outflow driven shocks and perhaps cosmic rays. In contrast to OH
and H2O megamasers which originate close to the nucleus, methanol megamasers
provide a new probe of feedback (e.g. outflows) processes on larger-scales and
of star formation beyond the circumnuclear starburst regions of active
galaxies.

investigated. We model the system behavior as a M/M/1+GI queue which is
represented by a two dimensional state transition graph. The reneging
probability of high priority packets and the average waiting time in two-class
priority queues is analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the average
waiting time of high priority packets decreases with the growing interference
power threshold and the average waiting time of the low priority packet is
proportional to the arrival rate of the high priority packet. This work may lay
the foundation to design efficient MAC protocols and optimize long term system

the planet and the protoplanetary disc. We examine the gap formation by a
planet with a new formulation of one-dimensional viscous discs which takes into
account the deviation from Keplerian disc rotation due to the steep gradient of
the surface density. This formulation enables us to naturally include the
Rayleigh stable condition for the disc rotation. It is found that the
derivation from Keplerian disc rotation promotes the radial angular momentum
transfer and makes the gap shallower than in the Keplerian case. For deep gaps,
this shallowing effect becomes significant due to the Rayleigh condition. In
our model, we also take into account the propagation of the density waves
excited by the planet, which widens the range of the angular momentum
deposition to the disc. The effect of the wave propagation makes the gap wider
and shallower than the case with instantaneous wave damping. With these
shallowing effects, our one-dimensional gap model is consistent with the recent
hydrodynamic simulations.

with the existence of solutions and the reconstruction of parameters from given

small density ratios when the contact angle is considered. The reason is that
the original contact angle adjustment method influences the stability of the

contact angle adjustment method, the density distribution near the wall is
artificially changed, and the contact angle is dependent on the surface
tension. Hence, it is very inconvenient to apply this method with a fixed

because of magnetic stresses. Recently published shearing box simulations
indicate that Ohmic resistivity, ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect all
play important roles in disk evolution. In the presence of a vertical magnetic
field, the disk remains laminar between 1-5au, and a magnetocentrifugal disk
wind forms that provides an important mechanism for removing angular momentum.
Questions remain, however, about the establishment of a true physical wind
solution in the shearing box simulations because of the symmetries inherent in
the local approximation. We present global MHD simulations of protoplanetary
disks that include Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, where the
time-dependent gas-phase electron and ion fractions are computed under FUV and
X-ray ionization with a simplified recombination chemistry. Our results show
that the disk remains laminar, and that a physical wind solution arises
naturally in global disk models. The wind is sufficiently efficient to explain
the observed accretion rates. Furthermore, the ionization fraction at
intermediate disk heights is large enough for magneto-rotational channel modes
to grow and subsequently develop into belts of horizontal field. Depending on
the ionization fraction, these can remain quasi-global, or break-up into
discrete islands of coherent field polarity. The disk models we present here
show a dramatic departure from our earlier models including Ohmic resistivity
only. It will be important to examine how the Hall effect modifies the
evolution, and to explore the influence this has on the observational
appearance of such systems, and on planet formation and migration.

it is a complete shape descriptor. Secondly, the shape context is nonlinearly
mapped to a subspace by kernel nonparametric discriminant analysis (KNDA) to
get a compact feature representation, and thus a trajectory is projected to a
single point in a low-dimensional feature space. Experimental results show
that, the proposed trajectory feature shows encouraging improvement than

enhanced for strong disorder and low dimensions. In one dimension and for
discrete uncorrelated random potentials, such as tight binding models, all
states are localized for any disorder strength. This is in contrast to
continuous random potentials, where we show here that regardless of the
strength of the random potential, we have delocalization in the limit where the
roughness length goes to zero. This result was obtained by deriving an
expression for the localization length valid for all disorder strengths. We
solved a non-linear wave equation, whose average over disorder yields the
localization properties of the desired linear wave equation. Our results, not

of CF+ (fluoromethylidynium ion) towards CygX-N63, a young and massive
protostar of the Cygnus X region. This detection occurred as part of an
unbiased spectral survey of this object in the 0.8-3 mm range, performed with
the IRAM 30m telescope. The data were analyzed using a local thermodynamical
equilibrium model (LTE model) and a population diagram in order to derive the
column density. The line velocity (-4 km s-1) and line width (1.6 km s-1)
indicate an origin from the collapsing envelope of the protostar.
  We obtain a CF+ column density of 4.10e11 cm-2. The CF+ ion is thought to be
a good tracer for C+ and assuming a ratio of 10e-6 for CF+/C+, we derive a
total number of C+ of 1.2x10e53 within the beam. There is no evidence of carbon
ionization caused by an exterior source of UV photons suggesting that the
protostar itself is the source of ionization. Ionization from the protostellar
photosphere is not efficient enough. In contrast, X-ray ionization from the
accretion shock(s) and UV ionization from outflow shocks could provide a large
enough ionizing power to explain our CF+ detection.
  Surprisingly, CF+ has been detected towards a cold, massive protostar with no
sign of an external photon dissociation region (PDR), which means that the only
possibility is the existence of a significant inner source of C+. This is an
important result that opens interesting perspectives to study the early
development of ionized regions and to approach the issue of the evolution of
the inner regions of collapsing envelopes of massive protostars. The existence
of high energy radiations early in the evolution of massive protostars also has
important implications for chemical evolution of dense collapsing gas and could
trigger peculiar chemistry and early formation of a hot core.

result is discussed in the framework of fully developed turbulence. But the
debate whether the super-diffusivity is generated by a turbulent dispersion
process, by the advection due to the convective pattern, or by even another
process, is still open, as is the question about the amount of diffusivity at
the scales relevant to the local dynamo process. To understand how such
peculiar diffusion in the solar atmosphere takes places, we compared the
results from two different data-sets (ground-based and space-borne) and
developed a simulation of passive tracers advection by the deformation of a
Voronoi network. The displacement spectra of the magnetic elements obtained by
the data-sets are consistent in retrieving a super-diffusive regime for the
solar photosphere, but the simulation also shows a super-diffusive displacement
spectrum: its competitive advection process can reproduce the signature of
super-diffusion. Therefore, it is not necessary to hypothesize a totally
developed turbulence regime to explain the motion of the magnetic elements on

introduce a new setting, in which it is assumed that each $f_{\mathfrak{u}}$
belongs to a normed space $F_{\mathfrak{u}}$, and that bounds
$B_{\mathfrak{u}}$ on $\|f_{\mathfrak{u}}\|_{F_{\mathfrak{u}}}$ are known. This
contrasts with the assumption in many papers that weights
$\gamma_{\mathfrak{u}}$, appearing in the norm of the infinite-dimensional

were determined by minimizing an error bound depending on the

vibrometer and fuel pressure transducer signals, and enables the quantitative
characterisation of quasi-cyclic internal flows without requiring modifications
to the injector, the working fluid, or limiting the fuel injection pressure.
The vibrometer, which uses the Doppler effect to measure the velocity of a
vibrating object, was used to scan injector nozzle tips during the injection
event. The data were processed using a discrete Fourier transform to provide
time-resolved spectra for valve-closed-orifice, minisac and microsac nozzle
geometries, and injection pressures ranging from 60 to 160MPa, hence offering
unprecedented insight into cyclic cavitation and internal mechanical dynamic
processes. A peak was consistently found in the spectrograms between 6 and
7.5kHz for all nozzles and injection pressures. Further evidence of a similar
spectral peak was obtained from the fuel pressure transducer and a needle lift
sensor mounted into the injector body. Evidence of propagation of the nozzle
oscillations to the liquid sprays was obtained by recording high-speed videos
of the near-nozzle diesel jet, and computing the fast Fourier transform for a
number of pixel locations at the interface of the jets. This 6-7.5kHz frequency
peak is proposed to be the natural frequency for the injector's main internal
fuel line. Other spectral peaks were found between 35 and 45kHz for certain
nozzle geometries, suggesting that these particular frequencies may be linked
to nozzle dependent cavitation phenomena.

stochastic earthquake source model. The model is supposed to demonstrate the
following features in the far-field body waves: 1) the omega-square
high-frequency (HF) behavior of displacement spectra; 2) lack of the
directivity effect in HF radiation; and 3) a stochastic nature of the HF signal
component. The model involves two stochastic elements: the local stress drop
(SD) on a fault and the rupture time function (RT) with a linear dominant
component. The goal of the present study is to investigate the Gusev model
theoretically and to find conditions for (1, 2) to be valid and stable relative
to receiver site. The models with smooth elements SD, RT are insufficient for
these purposes. Therefore SD and RT are treated as realizations of stochastic
fields of the fractal type. The local smoothness of such fields is
characterized by the fractional (Hurst) exponent H, 0 < H < 1. This allows us
to consider a wide class of stochastic functions without regard to their global
spectral properties. We show that the omega-square behavior of the model is
achieved approximately if the rupture time function is almost regular (H~1)
while the stress drop is rough function of any index H. However, if the rupture
front is linear, the local stress drop has to be function of minimal smoothness
(H~0). The situation with the directivity effect is more complicated: for
different RT models with the same fractal index, the effect may or may not
occur. The nature of the phenomenon is purely analytical. The main controlling
factor for the directivity is the degree of smoothness of the two dimensional
distributions of RT random function. For this reason the directivity effect is
unstable. This means that in practice the opposite conclusions relative to the
statistical significance of the directivity effect are possible

We have therefore developed a new model by which one can investigate whether
and how galaxy formation and evolution can be influenced by dust-related
physical processes such as photo-electric heating, H_2 formation on dust, and
stellar radiation pressure on dust in detail. A novel point of the model is
that different dust species in a galaxy are represented by `live dust'
particles (i.e., not test particles). Therefore, dust particles in a galaxy not
only interact gravitationally with all four components of the galaxy (i.e.,
dark matter, stars, gas, and dust) but also are grown and destroyed through
physical processes of ISM. First we describe a way to include dust-related

The treatment is employed for building of elementary linear operators, in
particular, two-qubit control-sign gate, Hadamard matrix between two

of the displaced number state from initial state. Coherent qubit with large

employs a large number of transmit antennas $M$. We consider a setup where the
BS employs $M_{\mathrm{osc}}$ free-running oscillators, and
$M/M_{\mathrm{osc}}$ antennas are connected to each oscillator. For this
configuration, we analyze the impact of phase noise on the performance of the
regularized zero-forcing (RZF), when $M$ and the number of users $K$ are
asymptotically large, while the ratio $M/K=\beta$ is fixed. We analytically
show that the impact of phase noise on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) can be quantified as an effective reduction in the quality of the
channel state information available at the BS when compared to a system without
phase noise. As a consequence, we observe that as $M_{\mathrm{osc}}$ increases,
the SINR performance of all considered precoders degrades. On the other hand,
the variance of the random phase variations caused by the BS oscillators
reduces with increasing $M_{\mathrm{osc}}$. Through Monte-Carlo simulations, we
verify our analytical results, and compare the performance of the precoders for
different phase noise and channel noise variances. For all considered
precoders, we show that when $\beta$ is small, the performance of the setup
where all BS antennas are connected to a single oscillator is superior to that
of the setup where each BS antenna has its own oscillator. However, the
opposite is true when $\beta$ is large and the signal-to-noise ratio at the
users is low.

possible thanks to the new Fermi LAT IGRB measurement, which now extends up to
an energy of 820 GeV. We quantify uncertainties in detail and show the
potential this type of search offers for testing the WIMP paradigm with a
complementary and truly cosmological probe of DM particle signals.

calculated in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions as well as the frequency dependent
conductivity and the phase diagram of localization in 3 dimensions for various
types of disorder distributions. The validity of a universal scaling function
of the length dependent conductance derived from this theory is discussed in
the strong coupling region. Quantitative agreement with results from numerical
diagonalization of finite systems demonstrates that the self-consistent
treatment of cooperon contributions is sufficient to explain the phase diagram
of localization and suggests that the system may be well described by a
one-parameter scaling theory in certain regions of the phase diagram, if one is
not too close to the transition point.

homogeneous ion-electron plasma beams are simulated in two dimensions using the
particle-in-cell (PIC) method. It is shown that current filaments, which form
due to the Weibel instability, develop a large scale longitudinal electric
field in the direction opposite to the current carried by the filaments as
predicted by theory. Fast moving ions in the current filaments decelerate due
to this longitudinal electric field. The same longitudinal electric field,
which is partially inductive and partially electrostatic, is identified as the
main source of acceleration of electrons in the current filaments. The
transverse electric field, though larger than the longitudinal one, is shown to
play a smaller role in heating electrons, contrary to previous claims. It is
found that, in 1D, the electrons become strongly magnetized and are
\textit{not} accelerated beyond their initial kinetic energy. Rather, the
heating of the electrons is enhanced by the bending and break-up of the
filaments, which releases electrons that would otherwise be trapped within a
single filament and hence slow the development of the Weibel instability (i.e.
the magnetic field growth) via induction as per Lenz's law. In 2D simulations
electrons are heated to about one quarter of the initial kinetic energy of
ions. The magnetic energy at maximum is about 4 percent, decaying to less than
1 percent by the end of the simulation. Most of the heating of electrons takes
place while the longitudinal electric field is still growing while only a small
portion of the heating is a result of subsequent magnetic field decay. The ions
are found to gradually decelerate until the end of the simulation by which time
they retain a residual anisotropy less than 10 percent.

bogus detections is unsustainable for next generation all-sky surveys and
significant effort is now being invested to solve the problem computationally.

real astrophysical transients and bogus detections from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium

from previous work in that it works directly on the pixels rather than
catalogued domain knowledge for feature design or selection. Three machine
learning algorithms are trained (artificial neural networks, support vector
machines and random forests) and their performances are tested on a held-out
subset of 25% of the training data. We find the best results from the random
forest classifier and demonstrate that by accepting a false positive rate of
1%, the classifier initially suggests a missed detection rate of around 10%.
However we also find that a combination of bright star variability, nuclear
transients and uncertainty in human labelling means that our best estimate of
the missed detection rate is approximately 6%.

planning, the use of robust optimization techniques has been put forward, as an
alternative to stochastic mathematical programming methods, to make the problem
tractable in realistic systems. Different sources of uncertainty have been
considered, mainly related to the capacity and availability of generation
facilities and demand, and making use of adaptive robust optimization models.
The mathematical formulations for these models give rise to three-level
mixed-integer optimization problems, which are solved using different
strategies. Although it is true that these robust methods are more efficient
than their stochastic counterparts, it is also correct that solution times for
mixed-integer linear programming problems increase exponentially with respect
to the size of the problem. Because of this, practitioners and system operators
need to use computationally efficient methods when solving this type of
problem. In this paper the issue of improving computational performance by
taking different features from existing algorithms is addressed. In particular,
we replace the lower-level problem with a dual one, and solve the resulting
bi-level problem using a primal cutting plane algorithm within a decomposition
scheme. By using this alternative and simple approach, the computing time for
solving transmission expansion planning problems has been reduced drastically.
Numerical results in an illustrative example, the IEEE-24 and IEEE 118-bus test
systems demonstrate that the algorithm is superior in terms of computational
performance with respect to existing methods.

been proposed for measuring $\Omega_{\rm b}$. The non-parametric method
proposed by Tremaine \& Weinberg (1984; TW) and based on stellar kinematics is
the most accurate. This method has been applied so far to 17 galaxies, most of
them SB0 and SBa types. We have applied the TW method to a new sample of 15
strong and bright barred galaxies, spanning a wide range of morphological types
from SB0 to SBbc. Combining our analysis with previous studies, we investigate
32 barred galaxies with their pattern speed measured by the TW method. The
resulting total sample of barred galaxies allows us to study the dependence of
$\Omega_{\rm b}$ on galaxy properties, such as the Hubble type. We measured
$\Omega_{\rm b}$ using the TW method on the stellar velocity maps provided by
the integral-field spectroscopy data from the CALIFA survey. Integral-field
data solve the problems that long-slit data present when applying the TW
method, resulting in the determination of more accurate $\Omega_{\rm b}$. In
addition, we have also derived the ratio $\cal{R}$ of the corotation radius to
the bar length of the galaxies. According to this parameter, bars can be
classified as fast ($\cal{R}$ $< 1.4$) and slow ($\cal{R}$>1.4). For all the
galaxies, $\cal{R}$ is compatible within the errors with fast bars. We cannot
rule out (at 95$\%$ level) the fast bar solution for any galaxy. We have not
observed any significant trend between $\cal{R}$ and the galaxy morphological
type. Our results indicate that independent of the Hubble type, bars have been
formed and then evolve as fast rotators. This observational result will
constrain the scenarios of formation and evolution of bars proposed by
numerical simulations.

input distances to mock stars with <1% bias.The method-intrinsic random
distance uncertainties for typical spectroscopic survey measurements amount to
around 10% for dwarf stars and 20\% for giants, and are most sensitive to the
quality of $\log g$ measurements. The code was validated by comparing our
distance estimates to parallax measurements from the Hipparcos mission for
nearby stars (< 300 pc), to asteroseismic distances of CoRoT red giant stars,
and to known distances of well-studied open and globular clusters. The external
comparisons confirm that our distances are subject to very small systematic
biases with respect to the fundamental Hipparcos scale (+0.4 % for dwarfs, and
+1.6% for giants). The typical random distance scatter is 18% for dwarfs, and
26% for giants. For the CoRoT-APOGEE sample, the typical random distance
scatter is ~15%, both for the nearby and farther data. Our distances are
systematically larger than the CoRoT ones by about +9%, which can mostly be
attributed to the different choice of priors. The comparison to known distances
of star clusters from SEGUE and APOGEE has led to significant systematic
differences for many cluster stars, but with opposite signs, and with
substantial scatter. Finally, we tested our distances against those previously
determined for a high-quality sample of giant stars from the RAVE survey, again
finding a small systematic trend of +5% and an rms scatter of 30%.

load units are not directly adjustable and nonlinearly depend on production

and energy intensive process in steel industry, a production scheduling
optimization model for ELD is proposed under TOU pricing, in which the
objective is to minimize electricity costs while considering penalties caused
by jumps between adjacent slabs. A NSGA-II based multi-objective production
scheduling algorithm is developed to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions, and then
TOPSIS based multi-criteria decision-making is performed to recommend an
optimal solution to facilitate filed operation. Experimental results and

especially in case of allowance for penalty score increase in a certain range.
Further analyses show that the proposed method has effect on peak load

to more traditional semi-Lagrangian schemes (which are usually based on
polynomial or spline interpolation).
  In this paper, we consider a parallel implementation of a semi-Lagrangian
discontinuous Galerkin method for distributed memory systems (so-called
clusters). Both strong and weak scaling studies are performed on the Vienna
Scientific Cluster 2 (VSC-2). In the case of weak scaling, up to 8192 cores, we
observe a parallel efficiency above 0.89 for both two and four dimensional
problems. Strong scaling results show good scalability to at least 1024 cores
(we consider problems that can be run on a single processor in reasonable
time). In addition, we study the scaling of a two dimensional Vlasov--Poisson
solver that is implemented using the framework provided. All of the simulation
are conducted in the context of worst case communication overhead; i.e., in a
setting where the CFL number increases linearly with the problem size.
  The framework introduced in this paper facilitates a dimension independent
implementation (based on C++ templates) of scientific codes using both an MPI
and a hybrid approach to parallelization. We describe the essential ingredients

covariant integration measure density). The new supergravity formalism
naturally triggers the appearance of a dynamically generated cosmological
constant as an arbitrary integration constant which signifies spontaneous
(dynamical) breaking of supersymmetry. Applying the new formalism to anti-de
Sitter supergravity allows us to appropriately choose the above mentioned
arbitrary integration constant so as to obtain simultaneously a very small
effective observable cosmological constant as well as a large physical
gravitino mass as required by modern cosmological scenarios for slowly

environment and the halo-exclusion effect. Given these accurate relations, we
have developed the HADRON-code (Halo mAss Distribution ReconstructiON), a
technique which permits us to assign halo masses to a distribution of haloes in
three-dimensional space. This can be applied to the fast production of mock
galaxy catalogues, by assigning halo masses, and reproducing accurately the
bias for different mass cuts. The resulting clustering of the halo populations
agree well with that drawn from the BigMultiDark $N$-body simulation: the power
spectra are within 1-$\sigma$ up to scales of $k=0.2\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, when
using augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory based mock catalogues. Only the
most massive haloes show a larger deviation. For these, we find evidence of the
halo-exclusion effect. A clear improvement is achieved when assigning the
highest masses to haloes with a minimum distance separation. We also compute
the 2- and 3-point correlation functions, and find an excellent agreement with
$N$-body results. Our work represents a quantitative application of the cosmic
web classification. It can have further interesting applications in the
multi-tracer analysis of the large-scale structure for future galaxy surveys.

construction of an ""analytic continuation"" of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). By
this, we mean that we construct analytic continuation of physical quantities in
LQG from real values of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ to the purely
imaginary value $\gamma = \pm i$. This should allow us to define a quantization
of gravity with self-dual Ashtekar variables. We first realized in [1] that
this procedure, when applied to compute the entropy of a spherical black hole
in LQG for $\gamma=\pm i$, allows to reproduce exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking
area law at the semi-classical limit. The rigorous construction of the analytic
continuation of spherical black hole entropy has been done in [2]. Here, we
start with a review of the main steps of this construction: we recall that our
prescription turns out to be unique (under natural assumptions) and leads to
the right semi-classical limit with its logarithmic quantum corrections.
Furthermore, the discrete and $\gamma$-dependent area spectrum of the black
hole horizon becomes continuous and obviously $\gamma$-independent. Then, we
review how this analytic continuation could be interpreted in terms of an
analytic continuation from the compact gauge group $SU(2)$ to the non-compact
gauge group $SU(1,1)$ relying on an analysis of three dimensional quantum
gravity.

environment is fundamental for understanding the effect of habitat changes on
ecosystem functioning. Recent attempts to address this problem have sought to
unify resource selection analysis, where animal space use is derived from
available habitat quality, and mechanistic movement models, where detailed
movement processes of an animal are used to predict its emergent utilization
distribution. Such models bias the animal's movement towards patches that are
easily available and resource-rich, and the result is a predicted probability
density at a given position being a function of the habitat quality at that
position. However, in reality, the probability that an animal will use a patch
of the terrain tends to be a function of the resource quality in both that
patch and the surrounding habitat. 2. We propose a mechanistic model where this
non-local effect of resources naturally emerges from the local movement
processes, by taking into account the relative utility of both the habitat
where the animal currently resides and that of where it is moving. We give
statistical techniques to parametrize the model from location data and
demonstrate application of these techniques to GPS data of caribou in
Newfoundland. 3. Steady-state animal probability distributions arising from the
model have complex patterns that cannot be expressed simply as a function of
the local quality of the habitat. In particular, large areas of good habitat
are used more intensively than smaller patches of equal quality habitat,
whereas isolated patches are used less frequently. 4. Whilst we focus on
habitats in this study, our modelling framework can be readily used with any
environmental covariates and therefore represents a unification of mechanistic
modelling and step selection approaches to understanding animal space use.

  In the first approach, point charges are associated with uniform neutralizing
backgrounds to form neutral pseudo-charges, while, in the second, one instead
considers bi-charges, \textit{i.e.} dumbells of antipodal point charges of
opposite signs. We establish the expressions of the electric potentials of
pseudo- and bi-charges as isotropic solutions of the Laplace-Beltrami equation
in $\mathcal{S}_{2}$. A multipolar expansion of pseudo- and bi-charge
potentials leads to the electric potentials of mono- and bi-multipoles
respectively. These potentials constitute non-isotropic solutions of the
Laplace-Beltrami equation the general solution of which in spherical
coordinates is recast under a new appealing form.
  We then focus on the case of mono- and bi-dipoles and build the theory of
dielectric media in $\mathcal{S}_{2}$. We notably obtain the expression of the
static dielectric constant of a uniform isotropic polar fluid living in
$\mathcal{S}_{2}$ in term of the polarization fluctuations of subdomains of
$\mathcal{S}_{2}$. We also derive the long range behavior of the equilibrium
pair correlation function under the assumption that it is governed by
macroscopic electrostatics. These theoretical developments find their
application in Monte Carlo simulations of the $2D$ fluid of dipolar hard
spheres.
  Some preliminary numerical experiments are discussed with a special emphasis

sufficient to ensure the transition to a radiation-dominated era and that

extracting information about phonons in this signal. The energy loss is related
to the mass of the much heavier nucleus, and is spread out due to atomic
vibrations. Importantly, while the width of the broadening is much larger than
the energy separation of isotopes, only the shift in the peak positions must be
detected if the beam is limited to a single atom. We conclude that the
experimental case will be challenging but is not excluded by the physical
principles as far as considered here. Moreover, the initial experiments
demonstrate the separation of gold and carbon based on a signal that is related
to their mass, rather than their atomic number.

  Run-Length-Encoding Method","16 pages and algorithm-flowcharts",,,,"cs.DS cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Run Length Encoding(RLE) is one of the oldest algorithms for data-compression
available, a method used for compression of large data into smaller and
therefore more compact data. It compresses by looking at the data for
repetitions of the same character in a row and storing the amount(called run)
and the respective character(called run_value) as target-data. Unfortunately it
only compresses within strict and special cases. Outside of these cases, it
increases the data-size, even doubles the size in worst cases compared to the
original, unprocessed data. In this paper, we will discuss modifications to
RLE, with which we will only store the run for characters, that are actually
compressible, getting rid of a lot of useless data like the runs of the
characters, that are uncompressible in the first place. This will be achieved
by storing the character first and the run second. Additionally we create a
bit-list of 256 positions(one for every possible ASCII-character), in which we
will store, if a specific (ASCII-)character is compressible(1) or not(0). Using
this list, we can now say, if a character is compressible (store [the
character]+[it's run]) or if it is not compressible (store [the character] only
and the next character is NOT a run, but the following character instead).
Using this list, we can also successfully decode the data(if the character is
compressible, the next character is a run, if not compressible, the next
character is a normal character). With that, we store runs only for characters,
that are compressible in the first place. In fact, in the worst case scenario,
the encoded data will create always just an overhead of the size of the
bit-list itself. With an alphabet of 256 different characters(i.e. ASCII) it
would be only a maximum of 32 bytes, no matter how big the original data was.

microscope scanner consisting in a search for a net of local calibration
coefficients (LCCs) in the process of automatic measurement of a standard
surface, whereby each point of the movement space of the scanner can be defined
by a unique set of scale factors. Feature-oriented scanning (FOS) methodology
is used to implement the distributed calibration, which permits to exclude in
situ the negative influence of thermal drift, creep and hysteresis on the
obtained results. The sensitivity of LCCs to errors in determination of
position coordinates of surface features forming the local calibration
structure (LCS) is eliminated by performing multiple repeated measurements
followed by building regression surfaces. There are no principle restrictions
on the number of repeated LCS measurements. Possessing the calibration database
enables correcting in one procedure all the spatial distortions caused by
nonlinearity, nonorthogonality and spurious crosstalk couplings of the
microscope scanner piezomanipulators. To provide high precision of spatial
measurements in nanometer range, the calibration is carried out using natural
standards - constants of crystal lattice. The method allows for automatic
characterization of crystal surfaces. The method may be used with any scanning
probe instrument.

non-parametric regression in both directions and age-stratified Spearman
correlation to detect possible relations. Despite strong correlations among
HR/HRV measures and among psychological measures, correlations between HR/HRV

However, we found an age dependency, suggesting some correlations in younger
people (HR with STAI-State, r = 0.39; with HADS-Anxiety, r = 0.52; both p <

the probability of an interstellar civilization arising on a habitable planet

such a hypothetical civilization's colonization efforts in the local Solar

possible colony sites in the percolation process. If an interstellar
civilization is very likely to have such colonization programs, and they can
travel over large distances, then the upper bound on the likelihood of such a
species arising per habitable world is on the order of $10^{-3}$; on the other
hand, if civilizations are not prone to colonize their neighbors, or do not
travel very far, then the upper limiting probability is much larger, even of
