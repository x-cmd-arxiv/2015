  Performance Metrics",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study consistency of learning algorithms for a multi-class performance
metric that is a non-decomposable function of the confusion matrix of a
classifier and cannot be expressed as a sum of losses on individual data
points; examples of such performance metrics include the macro F-measure
popular in information retrieval and the G-mean metric used in class-imbalanced
problems. While there has been much work in recent years in understanding the
consistency properties of learning algorithms for `binary' non-decomposable
metrics, little is known either about the form of the optimal classifier for a
general multi-class non-decomposable metric, or about how these learning
algorithms generalize to the multi-class case. In this paper, we provide a
unified framework for analysing a multi-class non-decomposable performance
metric, where the problem of finding the optimal classifier for the performance
metric is viewed as an optimization problem over the space of all confusion
matrices achievable under the given distribution. Using this framework, we show
that (under a continuous distribution) the optimal classifier for a multi-class
performance metric can be obtained as the solution of a cost-sensitive
classification problem, thus generalizing several previous results on specific
binary non-decomposable metrics. We then design a consistent learning algorithm
for concave multi-class performance metrics that proceeds via a sequence of
cost-sensitive classification problems, and can be seen as applying the
conditional gradient (CG) optimization method over the space of feasible
confusion matrices. To our knowledge, this is the first efficient learning
algorithm (whose running time is polynomial in the number of classes) that is
consistent for a large family of multi-class non-decomposable metrics. Our
consistency proof uses a novel technique based on the convergence analysis of
the CG method.

problems, if the intersection graph of the constraints has bounded tree-width
our construction yields a class of linear size formulations that attain any
desired tolerance. As a result, we obtain an approximation scheme for the
""AC-OPF"" problem on graphs with bounded tree-width. We also describe a more
general construction for pure binary optimization problems where individual

While the interplay of theory and numerical simulations has amplified community
awareness of the role of magnetic fields in angular momentum transport, there

back into improving practical models for comparison with observations. Here we
emphasize the need to incorporate the role of non-local transport more
precisely. To show where large scale transport would fit into the theoretical
framework and how it is currently missing, we review why the wonderfully
practical approach of Shakura-Sunyaev (1973,SS73) is necessarily a mean field
theory, and one which does not include large scale transport. Observations of
coronae and jets combined with the interpretation of results even from shearing
box simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) suggest that a
significant fraction of disc transport is indeed non-local. We show that the
Maxwell stresses in saturation are dominated by large scale contributions and
the physics of MRI transport is not fully captured by a viscosity. We also
clarify the standard physical interpretation of the MRi as it applies to
shearing boxes. Computational limitations have so far focused most attention
toward local simulations but the next generation of global simulations should
help to inform improved mean field theories. Mean field accretion theory and
mean field dynamo theory should in fact be unified into a single theory that
predicts the time evolution of spectra and luminosity from separate disc,
corona, and outflow contributions. Finally, we note that any mean field theory
has a finite predictive precision that needs to be quantified when comparing
the predictions to observations.

In many
cases, genes blocks are conserved between bacterial species, sometimes as
operons, when genes are co-transcribed. The conservation is rarely absolute:
gene loss, gain, duplication, block splitting, and block fusion are frequently
observed. An open question in bacterial molecular evolution is that of the
formation and breakup of gene blocks, for which several models have been
proposed. These models, however, are not generally applicable to all types of
gene blocks, and consequently cannot be used to broadly compare and study gene
block evolution. To address this problem we introduce an event-based method for
tracking gene block evolution in bacteria. Results: We show here that the
evolution of gene blocks in proteobacteria can be described by a small set of
events. Those include the insertion of genes into, or the splitting of genes
out of a gene block, gene loss, and gene duplication. We show how the
event-based method of gene block evolution allows us to determine the
evolutionary rate, and to trace the ancestral states of their formation. We
conclude that the event-based method can be used to help us understand the
formation of these important bacterial genomic structures. Availability: The

to summarize molecular motion change over time in live cells due to latent
state changes, e.g., changes induced by dynamic micro-environments,
photobleaching, and other heterogeneity inherent in biological processes. This
study focuses on techniques for analyzing Single Particle Tracking (SPT) data
experiencing abrupt state changes. We demonstrate the approach on GFP tagged
chromatids experiencing metaphase in yeast cells and probe the effective forces
resulting from dynamic interactions that reflect the sum of a number of
physical phenomena. State changes are induced by factors such as microtubule
dynamics exerting force through the centromere, thermal polymer fluctuations,
etc. Simulations are used to demonstrate the relevance of the approach in more
general SPT data analyses. Refined force estimates are obtained by adopting and
modifying a nonparametric Bayesian modeling technique, the Hierarchical
Dirichlet Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (HDP-SLDS), for SPT
applications. The HDP-SLDS method shows promise in systematically identifying
dynamical regime changes induced by unobserved state changes when the number of
underlying states is unknown in advance (a common problem in SPT applications).
We expand on the relevance of the HDP-SLDS approach, review the relevant
background of Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, show how to map discrete time
HDP-SLDS models to classic SPT models, and discuss limitations of the approach.
In addition, we demonstrate new computational techniques for tuning
hyperparameters and for checking the statistical consistency of model
assumptions directly against individual experimental trajectories; the
techniques circumvent the need for ""ground-truth"" and subjective information.

applicable when data are drawn from a sparse high-dimensional linear model and
contaminated by heavy-tailed distributions and/or outliers in the additive
errors and covariates. We first establish a form of local statistical
consistency for the penalized regression estimators under fairly mild
conditions on the error distribution: When the derivative of the loss function
is bounded and satisfies a local restricted curvature condition, all stationary
points within a constant radius of the true regression vector converge at the
minimax rate enjoyed by the Lasso with sub-Gaussian errors. When an appropriate
nonconvex regularizer is used in place of an l_1-penalty, we show that such
stationary points are in fact unique and equal to the local oracle solution
with the correct support---hence, results on asymptotic normality in the
low-dimensional case carry over immediately to the high-dimensional setting.
This has important implications for the efficiency of regularized nonconvex
M-estimators when the errors are heavy-tailed. Our analysis of the local
curvature of the loss function also has useful consequences for optimization
when the robust regression function and/or regularizer is nonconvex and the
objective function possesses stationary points outside the local region. We
show that as long as a composite gradient descent algorithm is initialized
within a constant radius of the true regression vector, successive iterates
will converge at a linear rate to a stationary point within the local region.
Furthermore, the global optimum of a convex regularized robust regression
function may be used to obtain a suitable initialization. The result is a novel
two-step procedure that uses a convex M-estimator to achieve consistency and a
nonconvex M-estimator to increase efficiency.

Numerical Langevin simulations of spin dynamics reproduce all measured neutron

of coherent magnetic precession mode. This ""rotor"" mode can be seen as a
high-temperature version of superparamagnetism and is driven by exchange
interactions between the two magnetic sublattices. The frequency of the rotor

a promising technique for obtaining mass estimates for large samples of galaxy
clusters and holds a key to studying the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
However, cosmological inference based on SZE cluster surveys is limited by our
incomplete knowledge of bias, scatter, and evolution in the Y-M relation. In
this work, we investigate the effects of galaxy cluster mergers on the scaling
relation using the Omega500 high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic
simulation. We show that the non-thermal pressure associated with
merger-induced gas motions contributes significantly to the bias, scatter, and
evolution of the scaling relation. After the merger, the kinetic energy of
merging systems is slowly converted into thermal energy through dissipation of
turbulent gas motions, which causes the thermal SZE signal to increase steadily
with time. This post-merger evolution is one of the primary source of bias and
scatter in the Y-M relation. However, we show that when the missing non-thermal
energy is accounted for, the resulting relation exhibits little to no redshift
evolution and the scatter around the scaling relation is ~20-30 % smaller than
that of the thermal SZE signal alone. Our work opens up a possibility to
further improve the current robust mass proxy, Y, by accounting for the missing
non-thermal pressure component. We discuss future prospect of measuring
internal gas motions in galaxy clusters and its implication for cluster-based
cosmological tests.

circular arcs in the plane and each edge is realized by an endpoint of one arc
touching the interior of another. A graph is (2,k)-sparse if every s-vertex
subgraph has at most 2s - k edges, and (2, k)-tight if in addition it has
exactly 2n - k edges, where n is the number of vertices. Every graph with a
CCA- representation is planar and (2, 0)-sparse, and it follows from known
results on contacts of line segments that for k >= 3 every (2, k)-sparse graph
has a CCA-representation. Hence the question of CCA-representability is open
for (2, k)-sparse graphs with 0 <= k <= 2. We partially answer this question by
computing CCA-representations for several subclasses of planar (2,0)-sparse
graphs. In particular, we show that every plane (2, 2)-sparse graph has a
CCA-representation, and that any plane (2, 1)-tight graph or (2, 0)-tight graph
dual to a (2, 3)-tight graph or (2, 4)-tight graph has a CCA-representation.
Next, we study CCA-representations in which each arc has an empty convex hull.
We characterize the plane graphs that have such a representation, based on the
existence of a special orientation of the graph edges. Using this
characterization, we show that every plane graph of maximum degree 4 has such a
representation, but that finding such a representation for a plane (2, 0)-tight
graph with maximum degree 5 is an NP-complete problem. Finally, we describe a
simple algorithm for representing plane (2, 0)-sparse graphs with wedges, where

from both of these methods are in a qualitative agreement with the previous
x-ray spectroscopy. On the other hand, the opening of the band gap separates
them apart. hybrid-exchange density-functional theory always gives a finite
band gap, down to $\sim 1.2$ eV from HSE06 functional, whereas by tuning the
Hubbard-$U$ parameter down to $0.5$ eV, a conducting state with AFM-C (defined

theory, the computed nearest-neighbouring exchange interaction along the
$c$-axis and in the $ab$-plane are $\sim 4$ meV and $\sim 6$ meV
(anti-ferromagnetic), respectively, which are qualitatively in agreement with
the previous magnetic measurements. These anti-ferromagnetic exchange
interaction, together with the in-plane anti-ferro-orbital ordering will induce
a spin-orbital frustration, which could play a role for the abnormal electronic
properties in CaCrO$_3$. In hybrid-exchange density-functional theory, an
abrupt reduction ($\sim 0.2$ eV) of the majority-spin band gap of the
ferromagnetic state between 60 K and 100 K has been found as lowering
temperature, which shows a strong link to the previous optical conductivity
measurements in [A. C. Komarek, et. al., Phys. Rev. B \textbf{84}, 125114

predicted AFM-C state as the lowest AFM state for the crystal structure

the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an arbitrary n-length signal, and has a
computational complexity of O(n log n). If the DFT X of the signal x has only k
non-zero coefficients (where k < n), can we do better? In [1], we addressed
this question and presented a novel FFAST (Fast Fourier Aliasing-based Sparse
Transform) algorithm that cleverly induces sparse graph alias codes in the DFT
domain, via a Chinese-Remainder-Theorem (CRT)-guided sub-sampling operation of
the time-domain samples. The resulting sparse graph alias codes are then
exploited to devise a fast and iterative onion-peeling style decoder that
computes an n length DFT of a signal using only O(k) time-domain samples and
O(klog k) computations. The FFAST algorithm is applicable whenever k is
sub-linear in n (i.e. k = o(n)), but is obviously most attractive when k is
much smaller than n.
  In this paper, we adapt the FFAST framework of [1] to the case where the
time-domain samples are corrupted by a white Gaussian noise. In particular, we
show that the extended noise robust algorithm R-FFAST computes an n-length
k-sparse DFT X using O(klog ^3 n) noise-corrupted time-domain samples, in
O(klog^4n) computations, i.e., sub-linear time complexity. While our
theoretical results are for signals with a uniformly random support of the
non-zero DFT coefficients and additive white Gaussian noise, we provide
simulation results which demonstrates that the R-FFAST algorithm performs well
even for signals like MR images, that have an approximately sparse Fourier

variety of scientific computing applications. However, architectural
differences between CPUs and GPUs necessitate the development of algorithms
that take advantage of GPU hardware. As sparse matrix vector multiplication
(SPMV) operations are commonly used in finite element analysis, a new SPMV
algorithm and several variations are developed for unstructured finite element
meshes on GPUs. The effective bandwidth of current GPU algorithms and the newly
proposed algorithms are measured and analyzed for 15 sparse matrices of varying
sizes and varying sparsity structures. The effects of optimization and
differences between the new GPU algorithm and its variants are then
subsequently studied. Lastly, both new and current SPMV GPU algorithms are
utilized in the GPU CG Solver in GPU finite element simulations of the heart.
These results are then compared against parallel PETSc finite element
implementation results. The effective bandwidth tests indicate that the new
algorithms compare very favorably with current algorithms for a wide variety of
sparse matrices and can yield very notable benefits. GPU finite element
simulation results demonstrate the benefit of using GPUs for finite element
analysis, and also show that the proposed algorithms can yield speedup factors
up to 12-fold for real finite element applications.

triggering and fuelling luminous AGN. We present deep multi-band (u/r/z)
imaging and long slit spectroscopy of four double-peaked [OIII] emitting AGN, a
class of objects associated with either kcp-separated binary AGN or final stage
major mergers, though AGN with complex narrow-line regions are known
contaminants. Such objects are of interest since they represent the onset of
AGN activity during the merger process. Three of the objects studied have been
confirmed as major mergers using near-infrared imaging, one is a confirmed
X-ray binary AGN. All AGN are luminous and have redshifts of 0.1 < z < 0.4.
Deep r-band images show that a majority (3/4) of the sources have disturbed
host morphologies and tidal features, while the remaining source is
morphologically undisturbed down to low surface brightness limits. The lack of
morphological disturbances in this galaxy despite the fact that is is a close
binary AGN suggests that the merger of a binary black hole can take longer than
~1 Gyr. The narrow line regions (NLRs) have large sizes (10 kpc < r < 100 kpc)
and consist of compact clumps with considerable relative velocities (~ 200-650
km/s). We detect broad, predominantly blue, wings with velocities up to ~1500
km/s in [OIII], indicative of powerful outflows. The outflows are compact (<5
kpc) and co-spatial with nuclear regions showing considerable reddening,
consistent with enhanced star formation. One source shows an offset between gas
and stellar kinematics, consistent with either a bipolar flow or a
counter-rotating gas disk. We are not able to unambiguously identify the
sources as binary AGN using our data, X-ray or radio data is required for an
unambiguous identification. However, the data still yield interesting results
for merger triggering of AGN and time-scales of binary black hole mergers.

for the double scrambler observations is 18 times more stable than the SLSF for
comparable slit observations and 9 times more stable than the SLSF for a single
fiber scrambler that we tested in 2010. For the double scrambler test data, we
further reduced the radial velocity scatter from an average of 2.1 m/s to 1.5
m/s after adopting a median description of the stabilized SLSF in our Doppler
model. This demonstrates that inaccuracies in modeling the SLSF contribute to
the velocity RMS. Imperfect knowledge of the SLSF, rather than stellar jitter,
sets the precision floor for chromospherically quiet stars analyzed with the
iodine technique using Keck HIRES and other slit-fed spectrometers. It is
increasingly common practice for astronomers to scale stellar noise in
quadrature with formal errors such that their Keplerian model yields a
chi-squared fit of 1.0. When this is done, errors from inaccurate modeling of
the SLSF (and perhaps from other sources) are attributed to the star and the
floor of the stellar noise is overestimated.

usually realized through chemical dopant or application of pressure in a
similar way to induce charge carriers of either electrons or holes into their
parent compounds. For chemical doping, superconductivity behaves asymmetrically
with the maximum $T_{c}$ often higher for optimal hole-doping than that of
optimal electron-doping on the same parent compound. However, whether electron
carriers could be in favour of higher $T_{c}$ than holes in such high-$T_{c}$
superconductors is unknown but attractive. Here we show that the application of
pressure can drive KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ from hole- to electron-superconductivity
after passing the previously reported $V$-shape or oscillation regime. The
maximum $T_{c}$ in the electron-dominated region is tripled to the initial
value of 3.5 K or the average in the low-pressure hole-dominated region. The
structural transition takes place from the tetragonal to collapsed tetragonal
phase when the carrier characteristic is changed upon compression. Our results
unambiguously offer a new route to further improve superconductivity with huge
$T_{c}$ enhancement for a compound through carrier switch. The strong

that their brightness is limited by optical saturation and photobleaching. As
an alternative, plasmonic metal nanoparticles are very promising as optical
labels with no photobleaching and low optical saturation at realistic exciting
intensities as was demonstrated in photoacoustic and photothermal sensing,
imaging, and theranostics. However, plasmonic nanoparticles have wide
absorption spectra and are not fluorescent, which limits their spectral
selectivity and multimodal functionality, respectively. Here we demonstrate
experimentally, both in vitro and in vivo, that spaser (surface plasmon
amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) provides unprecedented
efficiency as a versatile tool in biomedical research and applications. This is
due to the unique combination of intense near-monochromatic stimulated emission
and strongly enhanced absorption, free of optical saturation. Using soluble and
biocompatible uranine dye as a gain medium surrounding the gold nanocore as a
plasmonic resonator, we demonstrate unprecedented spaser stimulated emission
intensity (""giant spasing"") and a narrow spectral width (0.8 nm), which are
more than ~380-fold and ~30-fold, respectively, better than in quantum dots as
the best conventional fluorescent nanoprobes. At the same time, the plasmonic
spaser nanocore served as excellent photoacoustic and photothermal contrast
agents for imaging and nanobubble-based theranostics of cancer cells. This
makes the spasers, arguably, the best multifunctional, super-contrast,

that the data bus has an energy gap between the ground and first-excited states

can accomplish a high-fidelity and long-distance quantum state transfer.
Numerical simulations were performed for a finite system; the results show that

parties while each party does not disclose its own sensitive documents to
another party. In this paper, we propose an efficient 2-step protocol that
exploits a feature selection as the lower-dimensional transformation and
presents discriminative feature selections to maximize the performance of the
protocol. For this, we first analyze that the existing 1-step protocol causes
serious computation and communication overhead for high dimensional document
vectors. To alleviate the overhead, we next present the feature selection-based
2-step protocol and formally prove its correctness. The proposed 2-step
protocol works as follows: (1) in the filtering step, it uses low dimensional
vectors obtained by the feature selection to filter out non-similar documents;
(2) in the post-processing step, it identifies similar documents only from the
non-filtered documents by using the 1-step protocol. As the feature selection,
we first consider the simplest one, random projection (RP), and propose its
2-step solution SSDD-RP. We then present two discriminative feature selections
and their solutions: SSDD-LF (local frequency) which selects a few dimensions
locally frequent in the current querying vector and SSDD-GF (global frequency)
which selects ones globally frequent in the set of all document vectors. We
finally propose a hybrid one, SSDD-HF (hybrid frequency), that takes advantage
of both SSDD-LF and SSDD-GF. We empirically show that the proposed 2-step
protocol outperforms the 1-step protocol by three or four orders of magnitude.

uncertainties suppression, specially focussed on the latest $\theta_{13}$
measurement. The treatment starts with single detector in single reactor site,
most relevant for all reactor experiments beyond $\theta_{13}$. We demonstrate
there is no trivial error cancellation, thus the flux systematic error can
remain dominant even after the adoption of multi-detector configurations.
However, three mechanisms for flux error suppression have been identified and
calculated in the context of Double Chooz, Daya Bay and RENO sites. Our
analysis computes the error {\it suppression fraction} using simplified
scenarios to maximise relative comparison among experiments. We have validated
the only mechanism exploited so far by experiments to improve the precision of
the published $\theta_{13}$. The other two newly identified mechanisms could
lead to total error flux cancellation under specific conditions and are
expected to have major implications on the global $\theta_{13}$ knowledge
today. First, Double Chooz, in its final configuration, is the only experiment
benefiting from a negligible reactor flux error due to a $\sim$90\% geometrical
suppression. Second, Daya Bay and RENO could benefit from their partial
geometrical cancellation, yielding a potential $\sim$50\% error suppression,
thus significantly improving the global $\theta_{13}$ precision today. And
third, we illustrate the rationale behind further error suppression upon the
exploitation of the inter-reactor error correlations, so far neglected. So, our
publication is a key step forward in the context of high precision neutrino
reactor experiments providing insight on the suppression of their intrinsic
flux error uncertainty, thus affecting past and current experimental results,
as well as the design of future experiments.

The vibrational normal modes are classified using a semi-quantitative method.
This allows us to separate the aromatic and aliphatic vibrations and therefore

boost in dissipated energy with chain length emerges abruptly due to a
high-friction stick-slip mechanism caused by deformation of the slider leading
to a local commensuration with the substrate lattice. We derived a

relativistic jet powered by the accretion of a tidally-disrupted star onto a
super-massive black hole. Accompanying synchrotron radio emission is produced
by the shock interaction between the jet and the dense circumnuclear medium,
similar to a gamma-ray burst afterglow. An open mystery, however, is the origin
of the late-time radio rebrightening, which occurred well after the peak of the
jetted X-ray emission. Here, we systematically explore several proposed
explanations for this behavior by means of multi-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations coupled to a self-consistent radiative transfer calculation of the
synchrotron emission. Our main conclusion is that the radio afterglow of Swift
J1644+57 is not naturally explained by a jet with a one-dimensional top-hat
angular structure. However, a more complex angular structure comprised of an
ultra-relativistic core (Lorentz factor $\Gamma \sim 10$) surrounded by a
slower ($\Gamma \sim $ 2) sheath provides a reasonable fit to the data. Such a
geometry could result from the radial structure of the super-Eddington
accretion flow or as the result of jet precession. The total kinetic energy of
the ejecta that we infer of $\sim$ few $10^{53}\,$erg requires a highly
efficient jet launching mechanism. Our jet model providing the best fit to the

when the intensity of the process tends to infinity is studied. In the case of
Poisson processes a central limit theorem follows from recent results of
Wiener-Ito theory. In the case of non-Poisson processes we restrict to models
with finitely many orientations. Detailed analysis of correlation functions
exhibits various asymptotics for different combination of U-statistics and

orbits a young, active K dwarf every 8 hours. The mass of Kepler-78b has been
independently reported by two teams based on radial velocity measurements using
the HIRES and HARPS-N spectrographs. Due to the active nature of the host star,
a stellar activity model is required to distinguish and isolate the planetary
signal in radial velocity data. Whereas previous studies tested parametric
stellar activity models, we modeled this system using nonparametric Gaussian
process (GP) regression. We produced a GP regression of relevant Kepler
photometry. We then use the posterior parameter distribution for our
photometric fit as a prior for our simultaneous GP + Keplerian orbit models of
the radial velocity datasets. We tested three simple kernel functions for our
GP regressions. Based on a Bayesian likelihood analysis, we selected a
quasi-periodic kernel model with GP hyperparameters coupled between the two RV
datasets, giving a Doppler amplitude of 1.86 $\pm$ 0.25 m s$^{-1}$ and
supporting our belief that the correlated noise we are modeling is
astrophysical. The corresponding mass of 1.87 $^{+0.27}_{-0.26}$ M$_{\oplus}$

our nonparametric signal estimation. Based on our mass and the radius
measurement from transit photometry, Kepler-78b has a bulk density of

wide range of scales such as quantum devices, active and living matter, and
financial markets. Despite the ubiquitous nature of non-Gaussian noise, its
effect on activated transitions between metastable states has so far not been
understood in generality, notwithstanding prior work focusing on specific noise
types and scaling regimes. Here, we present a unified framework for a general
class of non-Gaussian noise, which we take as any finite-intensity noise with
independent and stationary increments. Our framework identifies optimal escape
paths as minima of a stochastic action, which enables us to derive analytical
results for the dominant scaling of the escape rates in the weak-noise regime
generalizing the conventional Arrhenius law. We show that non-Gaussian noise
always induces a more efficient escape, by reducing the effective potential
barrier compared to the Gaussian case with the same noise intensity.
Surprisingly, for a broad class of amplitude distributions even noise of
infinitesimally small intensity can induce an exponentially larger escape rate.
As the underlying reason we identify the appearance of discontinuous minimal
action paths, for which escape from the metastable state involves a finite
jump. We confirm the existence of such paths by calculating the prefactor of
the escape rate, as well as by numerical simulations. Our results highlight
fundamental differences in the escape behaviour of systems subject to thermal
and non-thermal fluctuations, which can be tuned to optimize switching
behaviour in metastable systems.

  Diffuse Optical Tomography",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (fDOT), the reconstruction of the
fluorophore concentration inside the target body is usually carried out using a
normalized Born approximation model where the measured fluorescent emission
data is scaled by measured excitation data. One of the benefits of the model is
that it can tolerate inaccuracy in the absorption and scattering distributions
that are used in the construction of the forward model to some extent. In this
paper, we employ the recently proposed Bayesian approximation error approach to
fDOT for compensating for the modeling errors caused by the inaccurately known
optical properties of the target in combination with the normalized Born
approximation model. The approach is evaluated using a simulated test case with
different amount of error in the optical properties. The results show that the
Bayesian approximation error approach improves the tolerance of fDOT imaging
against modeling errors caused by inaccurately known absorption and scattering
of the target.

Besides their importance for star formation, they govern the transport of
cosmic rays, relevant to the launch and regulation of galactic outflows and
winds, which in turn are pivotal in shaping the structure of halo magnetic
fields. Mapping the small-scale structure of interstellar magnetic fields in
many nearby galaxies is crucial to understand the interaction between gas and
magnetic fields, in particular how gas flows are affected. Elucidation of the
magnetic role in, e.g., triggering star formation, forming and stabilising
spiral arms, driving outflows, gas heating by reconnection and magnetising the
intergalactic medium has the potential to revolutionise our physical picture of
the ISM and galaxy evolution in general. Radio polarisation observations in the
very nearest galaxies at high frequencies (>= 3 GHz) and with high spatial
resolution (<= 5"") hold the key here. The galaxy survey with SKA1 that we
propose will also be a major step to understand the galactic dynamo, which is
important for models of galaxy evolution and for astrophysical
magnetohydrodynamics in general. Field amplification by turbulent gas motions,
which is crucial for efficient dynamo action, has been investigated so far only
in simulations, while compelling evidence of turbulent fields from observations

A complete theory of this intriguing phenomenon is still missing. Here we show
that ensemble nonequivalence can manifest itself also in random graphs with

This result holds irrespective of whether the energy is nonadditive (as in
unipartite graphs) or additive (as in bipartite graphs). In contrast with
previous expectations, our results show that: (1) physically, nonequivalence
can be induced by an extensive number of local constraints, and not necessarily
by long-range interactions or nonadditivity; (2) mathematically, nonquivalence
is determined by a different large-deviation behaviour of microcanonical and
canonical probabilities for a single microstate, and not necessarily for almost
all microstates. The latter criterion, which is entirely local, is not
restricted to networks and holds in general.

underlying erratic and disordered microscopic substratum, which we would like
to call quantum geometry and which is expected to play by quite different

analysis is played by a geometric renormalization group which creates (among
other things) a kind of sparse translocal network of correlations between the
points in classical continuous space-time and underlies, in our view, such
mysterious phenomena as holography and the black hole entropy-area law. The
same point of view holds for quantum theory which we also regard as a
low-energy, coarse-grained continuum theory, being emergent from something more
fundamental. In this paper we review our approach and compare it to the quantum

devices whose ultimate accuracy is achieved with Bose-Einstein condensates
(BEC) in extended free fall. This is ideally realized in microgravity
environments such as drop towers, ballistic rockets and space platforms.
However, the transition from lab-based BEC machines to robust and mobile
sources with comparable performance is a challenging endeavor. Here we report
on the realization of a miniaturized setup, generating a flux of $4 \times
10^5$ quantum degenerate $^{87}$Rb atoms every 1.6$\,$s. Ensembles of $1 \times
10^5$ atoms can be produced at a 1$\,$Hz rate. This is achieved by loading a
cold atomic beam directly into a multi-layer atom chip that is designed for
efficient transfer from laser-cooled to magnetically trapped clouds. The
attained flux of degenerate atoms is on par with current lab-based BEC
experiments while offering significantly higher repetition rates. Additionally,
the flux is approaching those of current interferometers employing Raman-type
velocity selection of laser-cooled atoms. The compact and robust design allows
for mobile operation in a variety of demanding environments and paves the way
for transportable high-precision quantum sensors.

finitely presented right $S$-act is finitely presented. The corresponding
notion for a ring $R$ states that every finitely generated submodule of every
finitely presented right $R$-module is finitely presented. For monoids (and
rings) right coherency is a finitary property which determines the existence of
a model companion of the class of right $S$-acts (right $R$-modules) and hence
that the class of existentially closed right $S$-acts (right $R$-modules) is
axiomatisable.
  Choo, Lam and Luft have shown that free rings are right (and left) coherent;
the authors, together with Ruskuc, have shown that groups, and free monoids,
have the same properties. We demonstrate that free inverse monoids do not.
  Any free inverse monoid contains as a submonoid the free left ample monoid,
and indeed the free monoid, on the same set of generators. The main objective
of the paper is to show that the free left ample monoid is right coherent.
Furthermore, by making use of the same techniques we show that both free
inverse and free left ample monoids satisfy $({\bf R})$, $({\bf r)}$, $({\bf
L})$ and $({\bf l)}$, conditions arising from the axiomatisability of classes
of right $S$-acts and of left $S$-acts.

waveforms could serve as features for further analysis, such as rule mining,
classification, and anomaly detection. The discovery of waveform patterns, also
known as time-series motifs, has been studied extensively; however, available
techniques for discovering frequently occurring time-series motifs were found
lacking in either efficiency or quality: Standard subsequence clustering
results in poor quality, to the extent that it has even been termed
'meaningless'. Variants of hierarchical clustering using techniques for
efficient discovery of 'exact pair motifs' find high-quality frequent motifs,
but at the cost of high computational complexity, making such techniques
unusable for our voluminous vehicular sensor data. We show that good quality
frequent motifs can be discovered using bounded spherical clustering of
time-series subsequences, which we refer to as COIN clustering, with near
linear complexity in time-series size. COIN clustering addresses many of the
challenges that previously led to subsequence clustering being viewed as
meaningless. We describe an end-to-end motif-discovery procedure using a
sequence of pre and post-processing techniques that remove trivial-matches and
shifted-motifs, which also plagued previous subsequence-clustering approaches.
We demonstrate that our technique efficiently discovers frequent motifs in
voluminous vehicular sensor data as well as in publicly available data sets.

lymphangiogenesis is markedly distinct from angiogenesis, occurring at
different times and in a different manner. Here a model of five ordinary

capillaries following a skin wound. The variables represent different cell
densities and growth factor concentrations, and where possible the parameters
are estimated from experimental and clinical data. The system is then solved
numerically and the results are compared with the available biological
literature. Finally, a parameter sensitivity analysis of the model is taken as
a starting point for suggesting new therapeutic approaches targeting the
enhancement of lymphangiogenesis in diabetic wounds. The work provides a deeper
understanding of the phenomenon in question, clarifying the main factors
involved. In particular, the balance between TGF-$\beta$ and VEGF levels,

geometry in a tight-binding regime. The atoms experience a laser-assisted
tunneling between the nearest neighbour sites of the dice lattice accompanied
by the momentum recoil. This allows one to engineer staggered synthetic
magnetic fluxes over plaquettes, and thus pave a way towards a realization of
topologically nontrivial band structures. In such a lattice the real-valued
next-neighbour transitions are not needed to reach a topological regime. Yet,
such transitions can increase a variety of the obtained topological phases. The
dice lattice represents a triangular Bravais lattice with a three-site basis
consisting of a hub site connected to two rim sites. As a consequence, the dice
lattice supports three dispersion bands. From this point of view, our model can
be interpreted as a generalization of the paradigmatic Haldane model which is
reproduced if one of the two rim sub-lattices is eliminated. We demonstrate
that the proposed upgrade of the Haldane model creates a significant added
value, including an easy access to topological semimetal phases relying only on
the nearest neighbour coupling, as well as enhanced topological band structures
featuring Chern numbers higher than one. The numerical investigation is
supported and complemented by an analytical scheme based on the study of
singularities in the Berry connection.

meromorphic germs, namely those with linear poles, which naturally arise in
various contexts in mathematics and physics. We express such a germ as a sum of
a holomorphic germ and a linear combination of special non-holomorphic germs
called polar germs. In analyzing the supporting cones -- cones that reflect the
pole structure of the polar germs -- we obtain a geometric criterion for the
non-holomorphicity of linear combinations of polar germs. This yields the
uniqueness of the above sum when required to be supported on a suitable family
of cones and assigns a Laurent expansion to the germ. Laurent expansions
provide various decompositions of such germs and thereby a uniformized proof of
known results on decompositions of rational fractions. These Laurent expansions
also yield new concepts on the space of such germs, all of which are
independent of the choice of the specific Laurent expansion. These include a
generalization of Jeffrey-Kirwan's residue, a filtered residue and a coproduct
in the space of such germs. When applied to exponential sums on rational convex
polyhedral cones, the filtered residue yields back exponential integrals.

concerning this validity or not and a possible set of new experiments to detect
primordial inflation and gravitational waves. Since gravitational waves imply
the existence of primordial magnetic fields in this context, C Bonvin, R Durrer
and R Marteens [Phys Rev Lett (2014)] have tried to associate the presence of
primordial magnetic fields to BICEP 2 by making use of CMB tensor modes. Here
we show that by considering torsion dilatonic lagrangean one obtains
cosmological magnetic fields of the order of $B\sim{10^{-10}G}$ which may seed
galactic dynamos. Actually this new result came out of a mistake of a recent
paper published by myself in JCAP (2014). These results are more in accordance
with Bamba results [JCAP (2014)] in the context of teleparallel theory of
gravity with Einstein's distant parallelism and torsion. These results also
support Einstein-Cartan sort of theories of gravity from well-known recent
data. Another example which supports the use of modified gravities with torsion
to investigate magnetogenesis is the alternative exampleof using axions with
transmutation into torsion to obtain cosmic magnetic seed bound of
$10^{-12}G$.This coincides with the lower bound obtained by Barrow et al [Phys
Rev D (2012)] in the interval of $10^{-20}G$ to $10^{-12}G$ in Friedmann
universes.

also correlated the physical measurements of a subgroup of 33 participants with
the largest flute they found comfortable. The data was used to derive a
predictive formula for the largest comfortable flute based on physical
measurements. The median age of players was 63 years with a mean of 6.9 years
playing Native American flute. Females reported significantly less time playing
the instrument (p = .004), but significantly faster self-reported progress
rates (p = .001). Physical discomfort was experienced by 47-64% of players at
least some of the time. Over 10% of players reported moderate discomfort on an
average basis. Females report significantly higher maximum and average physical
discomfort than males (p < .001 and p = .015, respectively). Height, arm span,
hand span, and reported length of time playing and experience level all
correlated with the largest flute that the player found comfortable.
Multivariate coefficient analysis on those factors yielded a formula with a
strong correlation to the largest comfortable flute (r = +.650). However, the
formula does not have sufficient correlation to have value in predicting flute
design. Customization of Native American flutes with the goal of improving
ergonomics is proposed as a worthwhile goal.

core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), we present a coherent network analysis to
detection, reconstruction, and the source localization of the
gravitational-wave (GW) signals. We use the {\tt RIDGE} pipeline for the
analysis, in which the network of LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, VIRGO, and
KAGRA is considered. By combining with a GW spectrogram analysis, we show that
several important hydrodynamics features in the original waveforms persist in
the waveforms of the reconstructed signals. The characteristic excess in the
spectrograms originates not only from rotating core-collapse, bounce and the
subsequent ring down of the proto-neutron star (PNS) as previously identified,
but also from the formation of magnetohydrodynamics jets and non-axisymmetric
instabilities in the vicinity of the PNS. Regarding the GW signals emitted near
at the rotating core bounce, the horizon distance extends up to $\sim$ 18 kpc
for the most rapidly rotating 3D model in this work. Following the rotating
core bounce, the dominant source of the GW emission shifts to the
non-axisymmetric instabilities. The horizon distances extend maximally up to
$\sim$ 40 kpc seen from the spin axis. With an increasing number of 3D models
trending towards explosion recently, our results suggest that in addition to
the best studied GW signals due to rotating core-collapse and bounce, the time
is ripe to consider how we can do science from GWs of CCSNe much more seriously
than before. Particularly the quasi-periodic signals due to the
non-axisymmetric instabilities and the detectability should deserve further
investigation to elucidate the inner-working of the rapidly rotating CCSNe.

in recent years, and their importance for the understanding of the physical
processes at work in the Intra Cluster Medium has been recognized. Halo and
relic sources have been detected in several tens clusters. A strong correlation
is present between the halo and relic radio power and the X-ray luminosity.
Since cluster X-Ray luminosity and mass are related, the correlation between
the radio power and X-ray luminosity could derive from a physical dependence of
the radio power on the cluster mass, therefore the cluster mass could be a
crucial parameter in the formation of these sources. The goal of this project
is to investigate the existence of non-thermal structures beyond the Mpc scale,
and associated with lower density regions with respect to clusters of galaxies:
galaxy filaments connecting rich clusters. We present a piece of evidence of
diffuse radio emission in intergalactic filaments. Moreover, we present and
discuss the detection of radio emission in galaxy groups and in faint X-Ray
clusters, to analyze non-thermal properties in low density regions with
physical conditions similar to galaxy filaments. We discuss how SKA1
observations will allow the investigation of this topic and the study of the
presence of diffuse radio sources in low density regions. This will be a
fundamental step to understand the origin and properties of cosmological
magnetic fields.

equation in incompressible Navier-Stokes problems. Preconditioned Krylov
subspace methods are popular for these problems, with BiCGStab and GMRES(m)
most frequently used for nonsymmetric systems. BiCGStab is popular because it
has cheap iterations, but it may fail for stiff problems, especially early on
as the initial guess is far from the solution. Restarted GMRES is better, more
robust, in this phase, but restarting may lead to very slow convergence.
Therefore, we evaluate the rGCROT method for these systems. This method
recycles a selected subspace of the search space (called recycle space) after a
restart. This generally improves the convergence drastically compared with
GMRES(m). Recycling subspaces is also advantageous for subsequent linear
systems, if the matrix changes slowly or is constant. However, rGCROT
iterations are still expensive in memory and computation time compared with
those of BiCGStab. Hence, we propose a new, hybrid approach that combines the
cheap iterations of BiCGStab with the robustness of rGCROT. For the first few
time steps the algorithm uses rGCROT and builds an effective recycle space, and
then it recycles that space in the rBiCGStab solver. We evaluate rGCROT on a
turbulent channel flow problem, and we evaluate both rGCROT and the new, hybrid
combination of rGCROT and rBiCGStab on a porous medium flow problem. We see
substantial performance gains on both problems.
