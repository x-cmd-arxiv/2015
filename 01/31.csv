in Cp was highly expected for PuO2 as other actinide dioxides. However,
least-square fit and local smoothing techniques applied to the experimental
enthalpy data of plutonium dioxide in 80's could not detect a lambda-peak in
specific heat that might be due to too scattered and insufficient experimental

current article, a superionic model of PuO2 is developed with partially ionic
model of a rigid ion potential. Thermophysical properties were calculated in
constant pressure-temperature ensemble using molecular dynamics simulation. The
Bredig transition with vicinity of a lambda-peak in specific heat was a
successfully observed for the model system at about 2100K. Moreover, the
experimental enthalpy change was well reproduced before and after the estimated

idea for this is Mach's: that time is to be abstracted from change. Temporal
Relationalism leads to, and better explains, the well-known Frozen Formalism
Problem encountered in GR and other background-independent theories at the
quantum level. Abstraction from change is then a type of emergent time
resolution of this. Moreover, the Frozen Formalism Problem is but one of the
many Problem of Time facets, which are notoriously interconnected. The current
article concerns modifications of physical formalism which ensure that once
Temporal Relationalism is resolved, it stays incorporated. At the classical

Lagrangian, Hamiltonian and Routhian. I next pass from velocities
$\dot{Q}\mbox{}^{A}$ to changes d$Q^{A}$. Then Lagrangians are supplanted by
Jacobi arc elements, Euler--Lagrange equations by Jacobi--Mach ones, and
momentum requires redefining but actions remain unchanged. A differential (d)
version of the Hamiltonian is required, giving rise to a variant of the Dirac

value in a wide spectrum of applications, which range from nano-technology to
pharmaceutical chemistry. However, these calculations are affected by severe
finite-size effects, such as the solution being depleted as the chemical

the environment of the chemical process of interest. This external force,
drawing molecules from a finite reservoir, maintains the chemical potential
constant in the region where the process takes place. We have applied the
C$\mu$MD method to the paradigmatic case of urea crystallization in aqueous

constant supersaturation conditions, and to extract growth rates and

springs and no excluded volume between the monomers. The Rouse model of
polymers is generalized to the case of self-propelled monomers and solved
analytically. The swelling, as characterized by the spatial extension of the
chain, scales with the monomer number defining a Flory exponent $\nu$ which is
$\nu =1/2, 0, 1$ in the three different situations. As a result, we find that
activity does not change the Flory exponent but affects the prefactor of the
scaling law. This can be quantitatively understood by mapping the system onto
an equilibrium chain with a higher effective temperature such that the chain
swells under an increase of the self-propulsion strength. We then use computer
simulations to study the effect of self-avoidance on active polymer swelling.
In the three different situations, the Flory exponent is now $\nu = 3/4, 1/4,
1$ and again unchanged under self-propulsion. However, the chain extension
behaves non-monotonic in the self-propulsion strength.

level systems (atoms) coupled to a single resonance mode of a cavity, two
physical phenomena associated with superradiance appear. A pronounced emission
peak on short time scales is related to the known superradiant burst of excited
atoms cooperatively radiating into free space. It is followed by relaxation to
a stationary state of the composite system such that for sufficiently large
atom-field coupling a strongly correlated state emerges. The crossover to this
state can be interpreted as the precursor of the transition from normal to
superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit of the Dicke Hamiltonian.
Motivated by recent experimental activities, these features are investigated in
detail for a mesoscopic number of atoms and a cavity embedded in a dissipative
medium described by a damped Dicke model. We identify observables and
characteristics of the quantum dynamics on shorter time scales which allow to
clearly distinguish weakly correlated from strongly correlated Dicke physics.

unknown. The TANAMI Collaboration recently reported on the multiwavelength
emission of six bright, variable blazars which are positionally coincident with
two of the most energetic IceCube events. Objects like these are prime
candidates to be the source of the highest-energy cosmic rays, and thus of
associated neutrino emission. We present an analysis of neutrino emission from
the six blazars using observations with the ANTARES neutrino telescope.The
standard methods of the ANTARES candidate list search are applied to six years
of data to search for an excess of muons --- and hence their neutrino
progenitors --- from the directions of the six blazars described by the TANAMI
Collaboration, and which are possibly associated with two IceCube events. Monte
Carlo simulations of the detector response to both signal and background
particle fluxes are used to estimate the sensitivity of this analysis for
different possible source neutrino spectra. A maximum-likelihood approach,
using the reconstructed energies and arrival directions of through-going muons,
is used to identify events with properties consistent with a blazar origin.Both
blazars predicted to be the most neutrino-bright in the TANAMI sample
(1653$-$329 and 1714$-$336) have a signal flux fitted by the likelihood
analysis corresponding to approximately one event. This observation is
consistent with the blazar-origin hypothesis of the IceCube event IC14 for a
broad range of blazar spectra, although an atmospheric origin cannot be
excluded. No ANTARES events are observed from any of the other four blazars,
including the three associated with IceCube event IC20. This excludes at a 90\%
confidence level the possibility that this event was produced by these blazars
unless the neutrino spectrum is flatter than $-2.4$.

the sometimes prohibitive memory requirements. This is especially troubling
considering advances in massively parallel computing and commercial graphics
processing units because of their already limited memory compared to the
current random access memory used in more traditional computation. To address
this issue in the field of continuous max-flow segmentation, we have developed
a \textit{pseudo-flow} framework using the theory of Bregman proximal
projections and entropic distances which implicitly represents flow variables
between labels and designated source and sink nodes. This reduces the memory
requirements for max-flow segmentation by approximately 20\% for Potts models
and approximately 30\% for hierarchical max-flow (HMF) and directed acyclic
graph max-flow (DAGMF) models. This represents a great improvement in the
state-of-the-art in max-flow segmentation, allowing for much larger problems to
be addressed and accelerated using commercially available graphics processing
hardware.

bootstrapping; given an appropriate computational parallelization, Monte Carlo

a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test to compare the two strains from a
parametric point of view; our example result shows that the two strains are 94%

studying death ligand induced apoptosis has increased due to the promising role
of recombinant soluble forms of death ligands (mainly recombinant TRAIL) in
anti-cancer therapy. A clear elucidation of how death ligands activate the type
1 and type 2 apoptotic pathways in healthy and cancer cells may help develop
better chemotherapeutic strategies. In this work, we use kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations to address the problem of type 1/ type 2 choice in death ligand
mediated apoptosis of cancer cells. Our study provides insights into the
activation of membrane proximal death module that results from complex
interplay between death and decoy receptors. Relative abundance of death and
decoy receptors was shown to be a key parameter for activation of the initiator
caspases in the membrane module. Increased concentration of death ligands
frequently increased the type 1 activation fraction in cancer cells, and, in
certain cases changes the signaling phenotype from type 2 to type 1. Results of
this study also indicate that inherent differences between cancer and healthy
cells, such as in the membrane module, may allow robust activation of cancer
cell apoptosis by death ligand induction. At the same time, large cell-to-cell
variability through the type 2 pathway was shown to provide protection for
healthy cells. Such elucidation of selective activation of apoptosis in cancer
cells addresses a key question in cancer biology and cancer therapy.

metal-rich stars, small planets (with radii less than four Earth radii) can

Earth-size, planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the Universe's

to a repulsive potential generated by the affine quantization. This procedure
shows that during contraction the quantum energy of anisotropic degrees of

quantum bounce, the classical recollapse is reproduced. Our treatment is put in

This is usually obtained using the atomic and molecular Zeeman effect in

the use of molecular lines is of advantage for studying cool objects. The
molecules MgH, TiO, CaH, and FeH are suited to probe stellar magnetic fields,
each one for a different range of spectral types, by considering the signal
that is obtained from modeling various spectral types. We have analyzed the
usefulness of different molecules (MgH, TiO, CaH, and FeH) as diagnostic tools
for studying stellar magnetism on active G-K-M dwarfs. We investigate the
temperature range in which the selected molecules can serve as indicators for
magnetic fields on highly active cool stars and present synthetic Stokes
profiles for the modeled spectral type. We modeled a star with a spot size of
10% of the stellar disk and a spot comprising either only longitudinal or only
transverse magnetic fields and estimated the strengths of the polarization
Stokes V and Q signals for the molecules MgH, TiO, CaH, and FeH. We combined
various photosphere and spot models according to realistic scenarios. In G
dwarfs, the molecules MgH and FeH show overall the strongest Stokes V and Q
signals from the starspot, whereas FeH has a stronger Stokes V signal in all G
dwarfs, with a spot temperature of 3800K. In K dwarfs, CaH signals are
generally stronger, and the TiO signature is most prominent in M dwarfs.
Modeling synthetic polarization signals from starspots for a range of G-K-M

vector via graphs has found widespread use in applications, and such
representations are popularly known as graphical models or Markov random
fields. These models have many useful properties, but their fundamental
attractive feature is their ability to reflect conditional independences
between blocks of variables through graph separation, a consequence of the
equivalence of the pairwise, local and global Markov properties demonstrated by
Pearl and Paz (1985). Modern day applications often necessitate working with
either an infinite collection of variables (such as in a spatial-temporal
field) or approximating a large high-dimensional finite stochastic system with
an infinite-dimensional system. However, it is unclear whether the conditional
independences present in an infinite-dimensional random vector or stochastic
process can still be represented by separation criteria in an infinite graph.
In light of the advantages of using graphs as tools to represent stochastic
relationships, we undertake in this paper a general study of infinite graphical
models. First, we demonstrate that naive extensions of the assumptions required
for the finite case results do not yield equivalence of the Markov properties
in the infinite-dimensional setting, thus calling for a more in-depth analysis.
To this end, we proceed to derive general conditions which do allow
representing the conditional independence in an infinite-dimensional random
system by means of graphs, and our results render the result of Pearl and Paz
as a special case of a more general phenomenon. We conclude by demonstrating
the applicability of our theory through concrete examples of
infinite-dimensional graphical models.

Our constraints benefit from the high controllability of the experimental

useful new platform for exotic particle searches, complementing other

Dynamics simulations of the structural models of fibrin(ogen) fragment D
complexed with synthetic peptides GPRP (knob 'A' mimetic) and GHRP (knob 'B'

decreasing with pulling force; yet, the dissociation kinetics were sensitive to
variations in acidity (pH=5-7) and temperature (T=25-37 C). There were similar
structural changes in holes 'a' and 'b' during forced dissociation of the
knob-hole complexes: elongation of loop I, stretching of interior region, and
translocation of the moveable flap. The disruption of the knob-hole
interactions was not an ""all-or-none"" transition, as it occurred through
distinct two-step or single-step pathways with or without intermediate states.
The knob-hole bonds were stronger, tighter, and more brittle at pH=7 than at
pH=5. The B:b knob-hole bonds were weaker, looser, and more compliant than the
A:a knob-hole bonds at pH=7, but stronger, tighter, and less compliant at pH=5.
Surprisingly, the knob-hole bonds were stronger, not weaker, at elevated
temperature (T=37 C) compared to T=25 C due to the helix-to-coil transition in
loop I, which helps stabilize the bonds. These results provide detailed
qualitative and quantitative characteristics underlying the most significant
non-covalent interactions involved in fibrin polymerization.

Sakai-Sugimoto model, a holographic top-down approach for QCD with chiral
quarks based on D8 probe branes in Witten's holographic model of
nonsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The rates for decays into two pions, two
vector mesons, four pions, and the strongly suppressed decay into four pi0 are
worked out quantitatively, using a range of the 't Hooft coupling which closely
reproduces the decay rate of rho and omega mesons and also leads to a gluon
condensate consistent with QCD sum rule calculations. The lowest holographic
glueball, which arises from a rather exotic polarization of gravitons in the
supergravity background, turns out to have a significantly lower mass and
larger width than the two widely discussed glueball candidates f0(1500) and
f0(1710). The lowest nonexotic and predominantly dilatonic scalar mode, which
has a mass of 1487 MeV in the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, instead provides a
narrow glueball state, and we conjecture that only this nonexotic mode should
be identified with a scalar glueball component of f0(1500) or f0(1710).
Moreover the decay pattern of the tensor glueball is determined, which is found
to have a comparatively broad total width when its mass is adjusted to around
or above 2 GeV.

Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ interacting with a quenched disordered
substrate that acts on the interface when the interface height is close to
zero. The substrate has the tendency to localize or repel the interface at
different sites and one can show that a localization-delocalization transition
takes place when varying the average pinning potential $h$: the free energy
density is zero in the delocalized regime, that is for $h$ smaller than a
threshold $h_c$, and it is positive for $h>h_c$. For $d\ge 3$ we compute $h_c$
and we show that the transition happens at the same value as for the annealed
model. However we can show that the critical behavior of the quenched model
differs from the one of the annealed one. While the phase transition of the
annealed model is of first order, we show that the quenched free energy is
bounded above by $ (h-h_c)_+^2$ times a positive constant and that, for
Gaussian disorder, the quadratic behavior is sharp. Therefore this provides an
example in which a {\sl relevant disorder critical exponent} can be made
explicit: in theoretical physics disorder is said to be {\sl relevant} when the
disorder changes the critical behavior of a system and, while there are cases
in which it is known that disorder is relevant, the exact critical behavior is
typically unknown. For $d=2$ we are not able to decide whether the quenched and
annealed critical points coincide, but we provide an upper bound for the
difference between them.

Several new features appear when an external field is applied. The Ginzburg -

depth was found also to be vastly different for longitudinal and transverse

interesting combination of conventional (symmetry-breaking) and spin glass

telescope with an optical--NIR spectrograph: it could measure molecular
absorption for non-terrestrial planets, as well as eclipses and phase
variations for the hottest jovians. Such a mission could observe up to 10^3
transits per year, thus enabling it to survey a large fraction of the bright
(J<11) TESS planets. JWST could be used to perform detailed atmospheric
characterization of the most interesting transiting targets (transit, eclipse,

discover a few temperate terrestrial planets transiting nearby M-Dwarfs.
Characterizing these worlds will be time-intensive: JWST will need months to

that: (1) more centrally-concentrated clusters have steeper radial

dimensions, the photometric and kinematic centres of globular clusters agree to
within ~1"", with a cluster-to-cluster rms of 4"" (including observational
uncertainties); (3) on average, the cores of globular clusters have isotropic
velocity distributions to within 1% (\sigma_t/\sigma_r = 0.992 +/- 0.005), with
a cluster-to-cluster rms of 2% (including observational uncertainties); (4)
clusters generally have mildly radially anisotropic velocity distributions
(\sigma_t/\sigma_r ~ 0.8-1.0) near the half-mass radius, with bigger deviations
from isotropy for clusters with longer relaxation times; (5) there is a
relation between \sigma_minor/\sigma_major and ellipticity, such that the more
flattened clusters in the sample tend to be more anisotropic, with
\sigma_minor/\sigma_major ~ 0.9-1.0. Aside from these general results and

the Main Injector (MI) and Recycler (RR). The extraction kicker gap has to
synchronize to the MI and RR injection bucket in order to avoid a beam loss at
the rising edge of the extraction and injection kickers. Magnetic cogging is
able to control the revolution frequency and the position of the gap using the
magnetic field from dipole correctors while radial position feedback keeps the

to the orbit changes and reduce beam energy loss when the gap is created. The

We
performed optical spectroscopic, polarimetric and photometric follow-up of this

the mid-eclipse times, we estimated an orbital period of 3.787 h, which is
above the orbital period gap of the cataclysmic variables. There are nine other
known polars with longer orbital periods, and only four of them are eclipsing.
We identified high and low-brightness states and high polarization modulated
with the orbital period. The spectra are typical of polars, with strong high
ionization emission lines and inverted Balmer decrement. The HeII4686 A line is
as strong as Hbeta. We modelled the photometric and polarimetric bright-state
light curves using the CYCLOPS code. Our modelling suggests an extended
emitting region on the WD surface, with a mean temperature of 9 keV and B in
the range 18 -- 33 MG, although the possibility that it could be a two-pole
accretor cannot yet be ruled out. The WD mass estimated from the shock
temperature is 0.67 Msol. The derived parameters are consistent with the
eclipse profile. The distance was estimated as 406+- 54 pc using the

stellar companion (BHXs) as sources of kinetic feedback by using hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations. Following previous results, our BHX model selects low
metal-poor stars ($Z = [0,10^{-4}]$) as possible progenitors. The model that
better reproduces observations assumes that a $\sim 20\%$ fraction of
low-metallicity black holes are in binary systems which produce BHXs. These
sources are estimated to deposit $\sim 10^{52}$ erg of kinetic energy per
event. With these parameters and in the simulated volume, we find that the
energy injected by BHXs represents $\sim 30\%$ of the total energy released by
SNII and BHX events at redshift $z\sim7$ and then decreases rapidly as baryons
get chemically enriched. Haloes with virial masses smaller than $\sim 10^{10}
\,M_{\odot}$ (or $T_{\rm vir} \lesssim 10^5 $ K) are the most directly affected
ones by BHX feedback. These haloes host galaxies with stellar masses in the
range $10^7 - 10^8$ M$_\odot$. Our results show that BHX feedback is able to
keep the interstellar medium warm, without removing a significant gas fraction,
in agreement with previous analytical calculations. Consequently, the
stellar-to-dark matter mass ratio is better reproduced at high redshift. Our
model also predicts a stronger evolution of the number of galaxies as a
function of the stellar mass with redshift when BHX feedback is considered.
These findings support previous claims that the BHXs could be an effective
source of feedback in early stages of galaxy evolution.

particular, we show that a novel and exotic notion of becoming is compatible

silicene in the case when the tension is $5\%$ and the electron doping equals
$3.5\times10^{14}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$. Under such conditions, silicene monolayer is
expected to exhibit the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_C$).
In particular, based on the electron-phonon spectral function and assuming wide
range of the Coulomb pseudopotential values
($\mu^{\star}\in\left\langle0.1,0.3\right\rangle$) it is stated that the
superconducting transition temperature decreases from $18.7$ K to $11.6$ K.
Similar behavior is observed in the case of the zeroth temperature
superconducting energy gap at the Fermi level: $2\Delta(0)\in\left\langle6.68,
3.88\right\rangle$ meV. Other thermodynamic parameters differ from the
predictions of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. In particular, the ratio
of the energy gap to the critical temperature changes in the range from $4.14$
to $3.87$. The ratio of the specific heat jump to the specific heat in the
normal state takes the values from $2.19$ to $2.05$, and the ratio of the
critical temperature and specific heat in the normal state to the thermodynamic
critical field increases from $0.143$ to $0.155$. It is also determined that

low temperatures. The surprising rapid growth of the crystal is attributed to
its high tolerance to point defects, which minimize the short-scale atomic
rearrangements to form the crystal. Our study suggests a new scenario of
devitrification, where phase transformation proceeds initially without

attributed to a combination of stellar pulsations and radiation pressure on
dust. Shock waves triggered by pulsations propagate through the atmosphere,
compressing the gas and lifting it to cooler regions, which create favourable
conditions for grain growth. If sufficient radiative acceleration is exerted on
the newly formed grains through absorption or scattering of stellar photons, an
outflow can be triggered. Strong candidates for wind-driving dust species in
M-type AGB stars are magnesium silicates (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ and MgSiO$_3$). Such
grains can form close to the stellar surface, they consist of abundant
materials and, if they grow to sizes comparable to the wavelength of the
stellar flux maximum, they experience strong acceleration by photon scattering.
  We use a frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamics code with a detailed
description for the growth of Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ grains to calculate the first
extensive set of time-dependent wind models for M-type AGB stars. The resulting
wind properties, visual and near-IR photometry and mid-IR spectra are compared
with observations.We show that the models can produce outflows for a wide range
of stellar parameters. We also demonstrate that they reproduce observed
mass-loss rates and wind velocities, as well as visual and near-IR photometry.
However, the current models do not show the characteristic silicate features at
10 and 18 $\mu$m as a result of the cool temperature of Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ grains in
the wind. Including a small amount of Fe in the grains further out in the
circumstellar envelope will increase the grain temperature and result in
pronounced silicate features, without significantly affecting the photometry in
the visual and near-IR wavelength regions.

computational acceleration, we carried out simulations of the protein forced
unfolding for the dimer WW-WW of the all-beta-sheet WW domains used as a model
multidomain protein. We found that while the physically non-interacting
identical protein domains (WW) show nearly symmetric mechanical properties at
low tension, reflected, e.g., in the similarity of their distributions of
unfolding times, these properties become distinctly different when tension is
increased. Moreover, the uncorrelated unfolding transitions at a low pulling
force become increasingly more correlated (dependent) at higher forces. Hence,
the applied force not only breaks ""the mechanical symmetry"" but also couples
the physically non-interacting protein domains forming a multi-domain protein.
We call this effect ""the topological coupling"". We developed a new theory,
inspired by Order statistics, to characterize protein-protein interactions in
multi-domain proteins. The method utilizes the squared-Gaussian model, but it
can also be used in conjunction with other parametric models for the

unique combination of radio and mm/sub-mm data allows us to directly measure
the spectral indices in and between the radio and mm/sub-mm regimes, including
the first mm/sub-mm spectral index measured for a BHXRB. Spectral fitting
revealed that both the mm (230 GHz) and sub-mm (350 GHz) measurements are
consistent with extrapolations of an inverted power-law from contemporaneous
radio data (1--30 GHz). This indicates that, as standard jet models predict, a
power-law extending up to mm/sub-mm frequencies can adequately describe the
spectrum, and suggests that the mechanism driving spectral inversion could be
responsible for the high mm/sub-mm fluxes (compared to radio fluxes) observed
in outbursting BHXRBs. While this power-law is also consistent with
contemporaneous optical data, the optical data could arise from either jet
emission with a jet spectral break frequency of $\nu_{{\rm

a lower jet spectral break frequency of $\nu_{{\rm

analysis solidifies the importance of the mm/sub-mm regime in bridging the
crucial gap between radio and IR frequencies in the jet spectrum, and justifies

sequences and select the most appropriate, instead of being bound to the single

example, we can select based on domain types of variables in the interpolants,
prefer to avoid loop counters, or compare with templates for potential loop
invariants, and thus control what kind of information occurs in the abstraction

detections on overlapping sub-windows are removed. Since the number of possible
sub-windows in even moderately sized image datasets is extremely large, the
classifier is typically learned from only a subset of the windows. This avoids
the computational difficulty of dealing with the entire set of sub-windows,

  In particular, the main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a

over all sub-windows. MMOD can be used to improve any object detection method

receives a response from pi 2 X among the (n- t) first responses to that query
or both links connecting pi and pj are timely. Based on this combination, a
simple hybrid authenticated Byzantine consensus protocol,benefiting from the

only consider the transmitter (Tx) or the receiver (Rx) side power consumption

To be more practical, this paper considers the joint Tx and Rx power
consumption in multiple-access radio networks, where the power model takes both
the transmission power and the dynamic circuit power into account. We formulate
the joint Tx and Rx energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem which is a
combinatorial-type one due to the indicator function for scheduling users and
activating radio links. The link EE and the user EE are then introduced which
have the similar structure as the system EE. Their hierarchical relationships
are exploited to tackle the problem using a divide-and-conquer approach, which
is only of linear complexity. We further reveal that the static receiving power
plays a critical role in the user scheduling. Finally, comprehensive numerical
results are provided to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for improving the system EE.

of periodic messages between vehicles. These messages contain position, speed,

they generate significant channel load. Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC)
algorithms have been proposed to minimize the channel load. However, while the
rationale for periodic message exchange is to improve awareness, existing DCC
algorithms do not use awareness as a metric for deciding when, at what power,
and at what rate the periodic messages need to be sent in order to make sure
all vehicles are informed. We propose an environment- and context-aware DCC
algorithm combines power and rate control in order to improve cooperative
awareness by adapting to both specific propagation environments (e.g., urban
intersections, open highways, suburban roads) as well as application
requirements (e.g., different target cooperative awareness range). Studying
various operational conditions (e.g., speed, direction, and application
requirement), ECPR adjusts the transmit power of the messages in order to reach
the desired awareness ratio at the target distance while at the same time
controlling the channel load using an adaptive rate control algorithm. By
performing extensive simulations, including realistic propagation as well as
environment modeling and realistic vehicle operational environments (varying
demand on both awareness range and rate), we show that ECPR can increase
awareness by 20% while keeping the channel load and interference at almost the
same level. When permitted by the awareness requirements, ECPR can improve the
average message rate by 18% compared to algorithms that perform rate adaptation
only.

complexity; this situation is a challenge for Early Event Detection (EED). This
paper proposes a data- driven unsupervised learning method to handle this
challenge. Specifically, the random matrix theories (RMTs) are introduced as
the statistical foundations for random matrix models (RMMs); based on the RMMs,
linear eigenvalue statistics (LESs) are defined via the test functions as the
system indicators. By comparing the values of the LES between the experimental
and the theoretical ones, the anomaly detection is conducted. Furthermore, we
develop 3D power-map to visualize the LES; it provides a robust auxiliary
decision-making mechanism to the operators. In this sense, the proposed method
conducts EED with a pure statistical procedure, requiring no knowledge of
system topologies, unit operation/control models, etc. The LES, as a key
ingredient during this procedure, is a high dimensional indictor derived
directly from raw data. As an unsupervised learning indicator, the LES is much
more sensitive than the low dimensional indictors obtained from supervised
learning. With the statistical procedure, the proposed method is universal and
fast; moreover, it is robust against traditional EED challenges (such as error
accumulations, spurious correlations, and even bad data in core area). Case
studies, with both simulated data and real ones, validate the proposed method.
To manage large-scale distributed systems, data fusion is mentioned as another
data processing ingredient.

network robustness when network defense mechanisms are implemented, especially
for networked engineering systems equipped with detection capabilities. In this
paper, a sequential defense mechanism is firstly proposed in complex networks
for attack inference and vulnerability assessment, where the data fusion center
sequentially infers the presence of an attack based on the binary attack status
reported from the nodes in the network. The network robustness is evaluated in
terms of the ability to identify the attack prior to network disruption under
two major attack schemes, i.e., random and intentional attacks. We provide a
parametric plug-in model for performance evaluation on the proposed mechanism
and validate its effectiveness and reliability via canonical complex network
models and real-world large-scale network topology. The results show that the

mitigates the possibility of network disruption by acquiring limited attack

the limited flux intensity of neutron beamline facilities and sometimes due to
the limitations of the detectors. However, some applications require the
studies of dynamic phenomena and can now be conducted at several high intensity
beamlines such as the recently rebuilt ANTARES beam line at the FRM-II reactor.
In this paper we demonstrate the capabilities of time resolved imaging for
repetitive processes, where different phases of the process can be imaged
simultaneously and integrated over multiple cycles. A fast MCP/Timepix neutron
counting detector was used to image the water distribution within a model steam
engine operating at 10 Hz frequency. Within <10 minutes integration the amount
of water was measured as a function of cycle time with a sub-mm spatial

terms of electrodes to obtain perturbed Green's function in the transition
region. This procedure first computes unperturbed Green's functions and
calculates perturbed Green's functions from the unperturbed ones using a
mathematically strict relation. Since the matrices to be inverted to obtain the
unperturbed Green's functions are sparse, complex-symmetric and shifted for a
given set of sampling energy points, we can use the shifted COCG method, in
which once the Green's function for a reference energy point has been
calculated, the Green's functions for the other energy points can be obtained
with a moderate computational cost. We calculate the transport properties of a
C$_{60}$@(10,10) carbon nanotube (CNT) peapod suspended by (10,10)CNTs as an
example of a large-scale transport calculation. The proposed scheme opens the
possibility of performing large-scale RSFD-NEGF transport calculations using

look at an ensemble of relevant studies. The Cochrane Collaboration's admirable
goal is to provide systematic reviews of all relevant clinical studies, in
order to establish whether or not there is a conclusive evidence about a
specific intervention. This is done mainly by conducting a meta-analysis: a
statistical synthesis of results from a series of systematically collected
studies. Health practitioners often interpret a significant meta-analysis
summary effect as a statement that the treatment effect is consistent across a
series of studies. However, the meta-analysis significance may be driven by an
effect in only one of the studies. Indeed, in an analysis of two domains of
Cochrane reviews we show that in a non-negligible fraction of reviews, the
removal of a single study from the meta-analysis of primary endpoints makes the
conclusion non-significant. Therefore, reporting the evidence towards
replicability of the effect across studies in addition to the significant
meta-analysis summary effect will provide credibility to the interpretation
that the effect was replicated across studies. We suggest an objective, easily
computed quantity, we term the r-value, that quantifies the extent of this
reliance on single studies. We suggest adding the r-values to the main results

decoding are widely applied in industries and medical sciences. In spite of
high demands in these applications for a universal decoder that can be applied
to all individuals simultaneously, large variation in brain activities across
individuals has limited the scope of many studies to the development of
individual-specific decoders. In this study, we used deep neural network (DNN),
a nonlinear hierarchical model, to construct a subject-transfer decoder. Our
decoder is the first successful DNN-based subject-transfer decoder. When
applied to a large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) database,
our DNN-based decoder achieved higher decoding accuracy than other baseline
methods, including support vector machine (SVM). In order to analyze the
knowledge acquired by this decoder, we applied principal sensitivity analysis
(PSA) to the decoder and visualized the discriminative features that are common
to all subjects in the dataset. Our PSA successfully visualized the
subject-independent features contributing to the subject-transferability of the
trained decoder.

three-orbital Hubbard model with a relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is
studied at five electrons per site. The numerical calculations are performed by
employing the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) method based on the
strong coupling expansion. We find that appropriately choosing bases, i.e., the
maximally spin-orbit-entangled bases, drastically improve the sign problem in
the CTQMC calculations, which enables us to treat exactly the full Hund's
coupling and pair hopping terms. This improvement is also essential to reach at
low temperatures for a large SOC region where the SOC most significantly
affects the electronic structure. We show that a metal-insulator transition is
induced by the SOC for fixed Coulomb interactions. The insulating state for
smaller Coulomb interactions is antiferromagnetically ordered with the local
effective total angular momentum $j=1/2$, in which the $j=1/2$ based band is
essentially half-filled while the $j=3/2$ based bands are completely occupied.
More interestingly, for larger Coulomb interactions, we find that an excitonic
insulating state emerges, where the condensation of an electron-hole pair in
the $j=1/2$ and $j=3/2$ based bands occurs. The origin of the excitonic
insulator as well as the experimental implication is discussed.

Sitter hyperbolic sections and their natural vacua, and identify a limit in
which it reduces to the planar section and the corresponding Bunch -Davies
vacuum state. Selecting the Bunch -Davies vacuum for a massless scalar field
implies a mixed reduced density matrix in a hyperbolic section of de Sitter
space. We stress that in the Bunch -Davies state the hyperbolic de Sitter
$n$-point correlation functions have to match the planar de Sitter $n$-point
correlation functions. The expressions for the planar and hyperbolic Bunch
-Davies correlation functions only appear different because of the
transformation from planar to hyperbolic coordinates. Initial state induced
deviations from the standard inflationary predictions are instead obtained by
considering the pure hyperbolic vacuum, as we verify explicitly by computing
the power - and bi -spectrum. For the bi -spectrum in the hyperbolic vacuum we
find that the corrections as compared to the standard Bunch -Davies result are
not enhanced in specific momentum configurations and strongly suppressed for
momenta large compared to the hyperbolic curvature scale. We close with some

distributed observation. We employ a least-squares technique and minimize the
$L^2$-norm of the distance from the observation to any solution. Taking the
hyperbolic equation as the main constraint of the problem, the optimality
conditions are reduced to a mixed formulation involving both the state to
reconstruct and a Lagrange multiplier. Under usual geometric optic conditions,
we show the well-posedness of this mixed formulation (in particular the inf-sup
condition) and then introduce a numerical approximation based on space-time
finite elements discretization. We prove the strong convergence of the
approximation and then discussed several examples for $N=1$ and $N=2$. The
problem of the reconstruction of both the state and the source term is also
addressed.

within-class reconstruction residual and simultaneously increase the
between-class reconstruction residual on the training data. The projections are

  the Presence of Eavesdropping Attack","8 pages, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 2015",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the intercept behavior of an industrial wireless sensor
network (WSN) consisting of a sink node and multiple sensors in the presence of
an eavesdropping attacker, where the sensors transmit their sensed information
to the sink node through wireless links. Due to the broadcast nature of radio
wave propagation, the wireless transmission from the sensors to the sink can be
readily overheard by the eavesdropper for interception purposes. In an
information-theoretic sense, the secrecy capacity of the wireless transmission
is the difference between the channel capacity of the main link (from sensor to
sink) and that of the wiretap link (from sensor to eavesdropper). If the
secrecy capacity becomes non-positive due to the wireless fading effect, the
sensor's data transmission could be successfully intercepted by the
eavesdropper and an intercept event occurs in this case. However, in industrial
environments, the presence of machinery obstacles, metallic frictions and
engine vibrations makes the wireless fading fluctuate drastically, resulting in
the degradation of the secrecy capacity. As a consequence, an optimal sensor
scheduling scheme is proposed in this paper to protect the legitimate wireless
transmission against the eavesdropping attack, where a sensor with the highest
secrecy capacity is scheduled to transmit its sensed information to the sink.
Closed-form expressions of the probability of occurrence of an intercept event
(called intercept probability) are derived for the conventional round-robin
scheduling and the proposed optimal scheduling schemes. Also, an asymptotic
intercept probability analysis is conducted to provide an insight into the
impact of the sensor scheduling on the wireless security. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed sensor scheduling scheme outperforms the
conventional round-robin scheduling in terms of the intercept probability.

paper a proposal is given to determine prices on electricity markets taking
into account the operational flexibility of power plants, such that the costs
of long-term capacity reserves can be paid by short-term electricity spot
markets. For this purpose, a measure of operational flexibility is introduced
enabling to compute an inflexibility fee charging each individual power plant
on a wholesale electricity spot market. The total sum of inflexibility fees
accumulated on the spot markets then can be used to finance a capacity market
keeping the necessary reserves to warrant grid reliability. Here each reserve
power plant then gets a reliability payment depending on its operational
flexibility. The proposal is applied to a small exemplary grid, illustrating
its main idea and also revealing the caveat that too high fees paradoxically
could create incentives to employ highly flexible power plants on the spot
market rather than to run them as backup capacity.

picture. In this thesis, basic properties of such a relativistic two-fluid
system are derived from the underlying microscopic physics of a complex scalar
quantum field theory. To obtain analytic results of all non-dissipative
hydrodynamic quantities in terms of field theoretic variables, calculations are
first carried out in a low-temperature and weak-coupling approximation. In a
second step, the 2-particle-irreducible formalism is applied: This formalism
allows for a numerical evaluation of the hydrodynamic parameters for all
temperatures below the critical temperature. In addition, a system of two
coupled superfluids is studied. As an application, the velocities of first and
second sound in the presence of a superflow are calculated. The results show
that first (second) sound evolves from a density (temperature) wave at low
temperatures to a temperature (density) wave at high temperatures. This role
reversal is investigated for ultra-relativistic and near-nonrelativistic
systems for zero and nonzero superflow. The studies carried out in this thesis
are of a very general nature as one does not have to specify the system for
which the microscopic field theory is an effective description. As a particular
example, superfluidity in dense quark and nuclear matter in compact stars are
discussed.

naturally admitting a polyhedral structure, Isbell, in his pioneering work on

admitting the structure of an injective metric space. A bit later, Mai and Tang
confirmed Isbell's conjecture that a simplicial complex is injectively
metrizable if and only if it is collapsible. Considerable advances in the
understanding, classification and applications of injective envelopes have
since been made by Dress, Huber, Sturmfels and collaborators, and most recently
by Lang. Unfortunately a combination theory for injective polyhedra is still
unavailable.
  Here we expose a connection to the duality theory of cubings -- simply
connected non-positively curved cubical complexes -- which provides a more
principled and accessible approach to Mai and Tang's result, providing one with
a powerful tool for systematic construction of locally-compact injective metric
spaces:
  Main Theorem. Any complete pointed Gromov--Hausdorff limit of locally-finite
piecewise-$\ell_\infty$ cubings is injective.
  This result may be construed as a combination theorem for the simplest
injective polytopes, $\ell_\infty$-parallelopipeds, where the condition for
retaining injectivity is the combinatorial non-positive curvature condition on
the complex. Thus it represents a first step towards a more comprehensive
combination theory for injective spaces.
  In addition to setting the earlier work on injectively metrizable complexes
within its proper context of non-positively curved geometry, this paper is
meant to provide the reader with a systematic review of the results~ ---~
otherwise scattered throughout the geometric group theory literature~ ---~ on

less latency. However, while the ergodic capacity and instantaneous capacity of
a wireless channel have been extensively studied, they are in many cases not
sufficient for use in assessing if data transmission over the channel meets the
quality of service (QoS) requirements. To address this limitation, we advocate
a set of wireless channel capacity concepts, namely ""cumulative capacity"",
""maximum cumulative capacity"", ""minimum cumulative capacity"", and ""range of
cumulative capacity"", and for each, study its properties by taking into
consideration the impact of the underlying dependence structure of the
corresponding stochastic process. Specifically, their cumulative distribution
function (CDFs) are investigated extensively, where copula is adopted to
express the dependence structures. Results considering both generic and
specific dependence structures are derived. In particular, in addition to
i.i.d., a specially investigated dependence structure is comonotonicity, i.e,
the time series of wireless channel capacity are increasing functions of a
common random variable. Appealingly, copula can serve as a unifying technique
for obtaining results under various dependence assumptions, e.g. i.i.d. and
Markov dependence, which are widely seen in stochastic network calculus.
Moreover, some other characterizations of cumulative capacity are also studied,
including moment generating function, Mellin transform, and stochastic service
curve. With these properties, we believe QoS assessment of data transmission
over the channel can be further performed, e.g. by applying analytical
