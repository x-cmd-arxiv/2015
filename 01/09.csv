exhibit quantum-driven continuous phase transitions (quantum critical points,

question of whether they show universal behaviour remain open issues. Here we
report measurements of heat capacity and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations
at low temperatures across a field-induced antiferromagnetic QCP

magnetic-field-induced change in Fermi surface is detected both in the dHvA

antiferromagnetic phase. Comparisons with band-structure calculations and
properties of isostructural CeCoIn$_5$ suggest that the Fermi-surface change at
B$_0^*$ is associated with a localized to itinerant transition of the Ce-4f
electrons in CeRhIn$_5$. Taken in conjunction with pressure data, our results
demonstrate that at least two distinct classes of QCP are observable in
CeRhIn$_5$, a significant step towards the derivation of a universal phase

coherent light pulses have been the key to increase the practicality of

compact gain-switched (GS) lasers, leading to high key rates in quantum key
distribution (QKD). Recently, the question arose of whether the same laser
could be employed to achieve high-speed measurement-device-independent-QKD, a
scheme that promises long-haul quantum communications immune to all detector
attacks. For that, a challenging highvisibility interference between
independent picosecond optical pulses is required. Here, we answer the above
question in the affirmative by demonstrating high-visibility interference from
two independent GS lasers triggered at 1GHz. The result is obtained through a
careful characterization of the laser frequency chirp and time jitter. By
relating these quantities to the interference visibility, we obtain a
parameter-free verification of the experimental data and a numerical simulation
of the achievable key rates. These findings are beneficial to other
applications making use of GS lasers, including random number generation and
standard QKD.

existing research in attack graph analysis do not consider the temporal aspects
associated with the vulnerabilities, such as the availability of exploits and
patches which can affect the overall network security based on how the
vulnerabilities are interconnected and leveraged to compromise the system.
Gaining a better understanding of the relationship between vulnerabilities and
their lifecycle events can provide security practitioners a better
understanding of their state of security. In order to have a more realistic
representation of how the security state of the network would vary over time, a
nonhomogeneous model is developed which incorporates a time dependent
covariate, namely the vulnerability age. The daily transition-probability
matrices are estimated using Frei's Vulnerability Lifecycle model. We also
leverage the trusted CVSS metric domain to analyze how the total exploitability

ideal candidate to investigate topological nontrivial correlated flat bands in

addition, we find conditions for which the inversion is of the 4f-6s type,
making SmO to be a rather unique system. The similarities of the crystal

defining constructs, models and methods, adding a semantic layer to SNs. In
this context, a leapfrog is expected to come from a hybrid approach merging the
disciplines above. Along this line, this work focuses on the propagation of
individual interests in social networks. The proposed framework consists of the
following main components: a method to gather information about the members of
the social networks; methods to perform some semantic analysis of the Domain of
Interest; a procedure to infer members' interests; and an interests evolution
theory to predict how the interests propagate in the network. As a result, one
achieves an analytic tool to measure individual features, such as members'
susceptibilities and authorities. Although the approach applies to any type of

dynamical systems defined on networks. The goal is to model and analyze certain
phenomena which must be framed beyond the context of networked dynamical
systems, understood as a set of interdependent dynamical systems defined on the
nodes of a (possibly evolving) graph. In order to advocate for a more flexible
approach to the study of network dynamics, we tackle some qualitative problems
which do not fall in this working scenario. First, we address a stability
problem on a network of heterogeneous agents, some of which are of dynamic
nature while others just impose restrictions on the system behavior. Our second
context assumes that the network is clustered, and we address a two-level
stability problem involving the dynamics of both individual agents and groups.
The aforementioned problems exhibit lines of non-isolated equilibria, and the
analysis implicitly assumes a positiveness condition on the edge weights; the
removal of this restriction complicates matters, and our third problem concerns
a graph-theoretic characterization of the equilibrium set in the dynamics of
certain networks with positive and negative weights, the results applying in
particular to signed graphs. Our approach combines graph theory and dynamical
systems theory, but also uses specific tools coming from linear algebra,
including e.g. Gersgorin discs or Maxwell-type determinantal expansions. The
results are of application in social, economic, and flow networks, among

presented in [1]. This interpretation reveals cognitive biases in the proof of
Cook's theorem that arise from the attempt of constructing a formula in CNF to
represent a computation of a nondeterministic Turing machine. Such cognitive
biases are due to the lack of understanding about the essence of
nondeterminism, and lead to the confusion between different levels of
nondeterminism and determinism, thus cause the loss of nondeterminism from the
NP-completeness theory. The work shows that Cook's theorem is the origin of the
loss of nondeterminism in terms of the equivalence of the two definitions of
NP, the one defining NP as the class of problems solvable by a nondeterministic
Turing machine in polynomial time, and the other defining NP as the class of
problems verifiable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.
Therefore, we argue that fundamental difficulties in understanding P versus NP
lie firstly at cognition level, then logic level.

noncommutative parameter ($\theta$). However, this formalism breaks Lorentz
invariance and one way to recover it is to define the NC parameter as a
variable, an extra coordinate of the system. One approach that uses the
variable $\theta$ was developed by Doplicher, Fredenhagen and Roberts (DFR) and
hence, their phase-space is formed by $(x,p,\theta)$ with extra-dimensions. In
this work we have demonstrated precisely that this phase-space is incomplete
because the variable $\theta$ requires an associated momentum and the so-called
DFR phase-space is in fact formed by $(x, p, \theta, \pi)$, where $\pi$ is an
useful object. One of the models used here to demonstrate this fact brought
other interesting results. We have used this complete phase-space to explain
some undefined results in the $\theta$-variable literature. Finally, we have
shown the importance of this DFR-momentum since with it we could fill the gap
that exist in $\theta$-variable results. In other words, we have computed the
field commutation relations of a QFT in this DFR phase-space. The results
obtained here match exactly with the postulated (not demonstrated) values that

Peano arithmetic is definable from another, then they satisfy different types.
We consider here the analogue of Ehrenfeucht's lemma for models of set theory.
The original argument applies directly to the ordinal-definable elements of any
model of set theory, and in particular, Ehrenfeucht's lemma holds fully for
models of set theory satisfying $V=HOD$. We show that the lemma can fail,
however, in models of set theory with $V\neq HOD$, and it necessarily fails in
the forcing extension to add a generic Cohen real. We go on to formulate a
scheme of natural parametric generalizations of Ehrenfeucht's lemma, namely,
the principles of the form $EL(A,P,Q)$, which asserts that whenever an object
$b$ is definable from some $a\in A$ using parameters in $P$, with $b\neq a$,
then the types of $a$ and $b$ over $Q$ are different. We also consider various
analogues of Ehrenfeucht's lemma obtained by using algebraicity in place of
definability, where a set $b$ is algebraic in $a$ if it is a member of a finite
set definable from $a$ (as in Hamkins, Leahy arXiv:1305.5953). Ehrenfeucht's
lemma holds for the ordinal-algebraic sets, we prove, if and only if the
ordinal-algebraic and ordinal-definable sets coincide. Using similar analysis,
we answer two open questions posed by Hamkins and Leahy, by showing that (i)
algebraicity and definability need not coincide in models of set theory and
(ii) the internal and external notions of being ordinal algebraic need not
coincide.

and energy transfer rates of quantum systems placed in the proximity of these

contribution, the radiative decay rate is barely affected by the presence of
the nanosphere, whereas the non-radiative decay rate is greatly enhanced due to
energy transfer from the quantum system to the nanosphere, leading to a strong
quenching of the emission of the quantum system. The emission wavelength of the
quantum emitter and its intrinsic quantum yield play an important role and the
impact of both has to be considered together when investigating their effect on
the non-radiative decay rate. The energy transfer process from the emitter to
the nanosphere has a complicated distance dependence, with a 1/r^6 regime,
characteristic of the F\""orster energy transfer mechanism, but also exhibiting
other distance dependence regimes. In the case of a donor-acceptor pair in the
presence of a Au nanosphere, the donor couples strongly to the nanosphere,
acting as an enhanced dipole; the donor-acceptor energy transfer rate then
follows a F\""orster trend, with an increased F\""orster radius. The angular
dependence of the energy transfer efficiency between donor and acceptor has a
strong dipole-dipole trend for small spheres and deviates from it for larger
spheres, especially when the donor and acceptor are on opposite sides of the
sphere. The spectral overlap of the donor emission, acceptor absorption and
gold nanosphere extinction shows an interesting trend in that the largest
F\""orster radius is obtained when the donor emission and acceptor absorption
maxima are somewhat red-shifted from the localized surface plasmon peak in the
extinction spectrum of the Au nanosphere, being located between it and the
near-field scattering maximum.

the appearance of polarization below TN2 is accompanied by the replacement of
the high temperature collinear magnetic order by a circular inclined spiral
with propagation vector ki=(1/2, 1/2, 1/2+-q). Moreover, we find that the
polarization approximately scales with the modulus of the magnetic modulation
vector q down to the lowest temperature investigated (T=3K). Further, we
observe occupational Fe/Cu disorder in the FeO5-CuO5 bipyramids, although a
preferential occupation of such units by Fe-Cu pairs is supported by the
observed magnetic order and by density functional calculations. We calculate
exchange coupling constants for different Fe/Cu distributions and show that,
for those containing Fe-Cu dimers, the resulting magnetic order is compatible

drastic sea level rise, posing significant risks to populations in low-lying
coastal regions. Calibration of computer models representing the behavior of
the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is key for informative projections of future sea
level rise. However, both the relevant observations and the model output are
high-dimensional binary spatial data; existing computer model calibration
methods are unable to handle such data. Here we present a novel calibration
method for computer models whose output is in the form of binary spatial data.
To mitigate the computational and inferential challenges posed by our approach,
we apply a generalized principal component based dimension reduction method. To
demonstrate the utility of our method, we calibrate the PSU3D-ICE model by
comparing the output from a 499-member perturbed-parameter ensemble with
observations from the Amundsen Sea sector of the ice sheet. Our methods help
rigorously characterize the parameter uncertainty even in the presence of
systematic data-model discrepancies and dependence in the errors. Our method
also helps inform environmental risk analyses by contributing to improved
projections of sea level rise from the ice sheets.

systems, such as transportation and communication networks. Most prior works
focus on the global robustness of a given graph at large, e.g., by measuring
its overall vulnerability to external attacks or random failures. In this
paper, we turn attention to local robustness and pose a novel problem in the
lines of subgraph mining: given a large graph, how can we find its most robust
local subgraph (RLS)?
  We define a robust subgraph as a subset of nodes with high communicability
among them, and formulate the RLS-PROBLEM of finding a subgraph of given size
with maximum robustness in the host graph. Our formulation is related to the
recently proposed general framework for the densest subgraph problem, however
differs from it substantially in that besides the number of edges in the
subgraph, robustness also concerns with the placement of edges, i.e., the
subgraph topology. We show that the RLS-PROBLEM is NP-hard and propose two
heuristic algorithms based on top-down and bottom-up search strategies.
Further, we present modifications of our algorithms to handle three practical
variants of the RLS-PROBLEM. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs
demonstrate that we find subgraphs with larger robustness than the densest
subgraphs even at lower densities, suggesting that the existing approaches are
not suitable for the new problem setting.

membership problems in many areas of Computer Science (networking, distributed

data, problems arise where a large number of Bloom filters are available, and
all them need to be searched for potential matches. As an example, in a
federated cloud environment, each cloud provider could encode the information
using Bloom filters and share the Bloom filters with a central coordinator. The
problem of interest is not only whether a given element is in any of the sets
represented by the Bloom filters, but which of the existing sets contain the
given element. This problem cannot be solved by just constructing a Bloom
filter on the union of all the sets. Instead, we effectively have a
multidimensional Bloom filter problem: given an element, we wish to receive a
list of candidate sets where the element might be.
  To solve this problem, we consider 3 alternatives. Firstly, we can naively
check many Bloom filters. Secondly, we propose to organize the Bloom filters in
a hierarchical index structure akin to a B+ tree, that we call Bloofi. Finally,
we propose another data structure that packs the Bloom filters in such a way as
to exploit bit-level parallelism, which we call Flat-Bloofi.

provide scalable and efficient solutions alternatives to search through a large

almost entirely by the fastness parameter omega_s=Omega_star/Omega_K(r_m),
where Omega_star is the angular velocity of the star and Omega_K(r_m) is the
angular velocity of the Keplerian disc at the disc-magnetosphere boundary

instabilities is present in stars with different magnetospheric sizes. However,
only in stars with relatively small magnetospheres, r_m/R_star < 7, do the
unstable tongues produce chaotic hot spots on the stellar surface and irregular
light-curves. At even smaller values of the fastness parameter, omega_s < 0.45,
multiple irregular tongues merge, forming one or two ordered unstable tongues
that rotate with the angular frequency of the inner disc. This transition
occurs in stars with even smaller magnetospheres, r_m/R_star < 4.2. Most of our
simulations were performed at a small tilt of the dipole magnetosphere, Theta=5
degrees, and a small viscosity parameter alpha=0.02. Test simulations at higher
alpha values show that many more cases become unstable, and the light-curves
become even more irregular. Test simulations at larger tilts of the dipole
Theta show that instability is present, however, accretion in two funnel
streams dominates if Theta > 15 degrees. The results of these simulations can
be applied to accreting magnetized stars with relatively small magnetospheres:
Classical T Tauri stars, accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, and cataclysmics

sites $n-1$, $n$, $n+1$ for the first time. Considering a negative flow of the
discrete Chen-Lee-Liu hierarchy, we obtain a proper discretization of the
massive Thirring model in light-cone coordinates. Multicomponent
generalizations of the obtained discrete equations are straightforward because
the performed computations are valid for the general case where the dependent

adaptively refineable ""Lagrangian phase space elements"". These geometrical
elements are piecewise smooth maps between Lagrangian space and Eulerian phase
space and approximate the continuum structure of the distribution function.
They allow for dynamical adaptive splitting to accurately follow the evolution
even in regions of very strong mixing. We discuss in detail various one-, two-

method. Its advantages compared to N-body algorithms are: i) explicit tracking
of the fine-grained distribution function, ii) natural representation of
caustics, iii) intrinsically smooth gravitational potential fields, thus iv)
eliminating the need for any type of ad-hoc force softening. We show the
potential of our method by simulating structure formation in a warm dark matter
scenario. We discuss how spurious collisionality and large-scale discreteness
noise of N-body methods are both strongly suppressed, which eliminates the
artificial fragmentation of filaments. Therefore, we argue that our new
approach improves on the N-body method when simulating self-gravitating cold

as an exponential. Compared to this canonical form, however, the profiles in
the majority of disc galaxies show downward or upward breaks at large radii.
Currently, there is no coherent explanation in a galaxy formation context of
the radial profile per se, along with the two types of profile breaks. Using a
set of controlled hydrodynamic simulations of disc galaxy formation, we find a
correlation between the host halo's initial angular momentum and the resulting
radial profile of the stellar disc: galaxies that live in haloes with a low
spin parameter {\lambda} <~ 0.03 show an up-bending break in their disc density
profiles, while galaxies in haloes of higher angular momentum show a
down-bending break. We find that the case of pure exponential profiles
({\lambda} ~ 0.035) coincides with the peak of the spin parameter distribution
from cosmological simulations. Our simulations not only imply an explanation of
the observed behaviours, but also suggest that the physical origin of this
effect is related to the amount of radial redistribution of stellar mass, which
is anti-correlated with {\lambda}.

axis-free Yin-Yang grid and a sophisticated treatment of three-flavor,
energy-dependent neutrino transport. The progenitor is a nonrotating,
zero-metallicity 9.6 Msun star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry
outward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after bounce, a successful
explosion starts at ~130 ms postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model
explodes at about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in 2D and
a more quickly increasing and roughly 10 percent higher explosion energy of
>10^50 erg. The more favorable explosion conditions in 3D are explained by
lower temperatures and thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer
below the gain radius. This moves the gain radius inward and leads to a bigger
mass in the gain layer, whose larger recombination energy boosts the explosion
energy in 3D. These differences are caused by less coherent, less massive, and
less rapid convective downdrafts associated with postshock convection in 3D.
The less violent impact of these accretion downflows in the cooling layer
produces less shock heating and therefore diminishes energy losses by neutrino
emission. We thus have, for the first time, identified a reduced mass accretion
rate, lower infall velocities, and a smaller surface filling factor of
convective downdrafts as consequences of 3D postshock turbulence that
facilitate neutrino-driven explosions and strengthen them compared to the 2D
case.

to the Higgs mass. Large couplings in the Higgs sector that spontaneously
breaks $SO(5)$ minimize the tuning, and are also motivated by the requirements
of generating a sufficiently large Higgs quartic coupling and of maintaining a
natural approximate global $SO(5)$ symmetry. When these conditions are imposed,
theories of this type predict heavy Higgsinos. This construction differs from
composite Higgs models in that no new particles are introduced to form complete
$SO(5)$ multiplets involving the top quark---the stop is the only top partner.
Compatibility with Higgs coupling measurements requires cancelations among
contributions to the Higgs mass squared parameter at the 10% level. An
important implication of this construction is that the compressed region of

soft-collinear factorization, and the $\tilde{N}_{\rm jet}$ cross section
exhibits a number of unique features, including the absence of collinear

observations allow us to identify bona fide low mass groups at high redshift
and enable measurements of their total halo masses. We compute aggregate
stellar masses for these halos using galaxies from the Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS

group halos with masses 10^{12.8}<M200/Msun<10^{13.5} (about the mass of Fornax

at these redshifts, we find that the stellar-to-halo mass ratio decreases
toward higher halo masses, consistent with other work in the local and high
redshift universe. The observed scatter about the stellar-halo mass relation is
~0.25 dex, which is relatively small and suggests that total group stellar mass
can serve as a rough proxy for halo mass. We find no evidence for any
significant evolution in the stellar-halo mass relation since z<1. Quantifying
the stellar content in groups since this epoch is critical given that
hierarchical assembly leads to such halos growing in number density and hosting

strong mass dependence of the escape fraction. The lower potential well in

with virial mass above 1e8 solar mass supernova feedback is important, but only
30% of the haloes in this mass range have an escape fraction higher than 1%. We
find a large range of escape fractions in haloes with similar properties,

very hard to predict the escape fraction on the basis of halo properties and
results in a highly anisotropic escape fraction. The strong mass dependence,
the large spread and the large anisotropy of the escape fraction may strongly
affect the topology of reionization and is something current models of cosmic
reionization should strive to take into account.

smaller and more widespread cosmic HII patches; and (ii) as reservoirs of
neutral gas they contribute a non-zero 21-cm signal in otherwise ionized

during reionization, making detection of the epoch of reionization with 21-cm
interferometry more challenging. Here we systematically investigate these
effects using the latest semi-numerical simulations. We find that sinks
dramatically suppress the peak in the redshift evolution of the variance,
corresponding to the midpoint of reionization. As previously predicted,
skewness changes sign at midpoint, but the fluctuations in the residual HI
suppress a late-time rise. Furthermore, large levels of residual HI
dramatically alter the evolution of the variance, skewness and power spectrum

at z = 0.7 - 1.5. This difference arises because many satellites experienced
""group preprocessing"" in another host halo, typically of M_vir ~ 10^{10-12}

those closer to the MW/M31 fell in earlier and are more likely to have

a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry remnant of the spontaneous breaking of a global
$U(1)_\text{DM}$ symmetry. Consequently, this model has a natural dark matter
candidate and a Goldstone boson in the physical spectrum. In addition, the
Higgs boson properties are changed with respect to the Standard Model due to
the mixing with a new particle. We explore regions in the parameter space
taking into account bounds from the measured Higgs properties, dark matter
direct detection as well as measurements of the effective number of neutrino
species before recombination. The dark matter relic density is determined by
three classes of processes: the usual self-annihilation, semi-annihilation and
purely dark matter $3 \to 2$ processes. The latter has been subject of recent
interest leading to the so-called `Strongly Interacting Massive Particle'
(SIMP) scenario. We show under which conditions our model can lead to a
concrete realization of such scenario and study the possibility that the dark
matter self-interactions could address the small scale structure problems. In
particular, we find that in order for the SIMP scenario to work, the dark
matter mass must be in the range $7-115$ MeV, with the global symmetry energy
breaking scale in the TeV range.

galaxy clusters from their mass profiles beyond the virial radius $R_{200}$. We
derive the accretion rate from the mass of a spherical shell whose inner radius
is $2R_{200}$, whose thickness changes with redshift, and whose infall velocity
is assumed to be equal to the mean infall velocity of the spherical shells of
dark matter halos extracted from $N$-body simulations. This approximation is
rather crude in hierarchical clustering scenarios where both smooth accretion
and aggregation of smaller dark matter halos contribute to the mass accretion
of clusters.Nevertheless, in the redshift range $z=[0,2]$, our prescription
returns an average MAR within $20-40 \%$ of the average rate derived from the
merger trees of dark matter halos extracted from $N$-body simulations. The MAR
of galaxy clusters has been the topic of numerous detailed numerical and
theoretical investigations, but so far it has remained inaccessible to
measurements in the real universe. Since the measurement of the mass profile of
clusters beyond their virial radius can be performed with the caustic technique
applied to dense redshift surveys of the cluster outer regions, our result
suggests that measuring the mean MAR of a sample of galaxy clusters is actually
feasible. We thus provide a new potential observational test of the
cosmological and structure formation models.

short period suggests a low mass ratio, and an asymmetric, precessing disk due
to additional tidal torques from the donor star since the disk crosses the 3:1
resonance. Previous theoretical 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamical modeling
suggested a super-orbital disk precession period 29$\pm$1 times the orbital
period, i.e. $\sim$81$\pm$3 hr. We conducted a Swift monitoring campaign of 30
observations over ~1 month in order to search for evidence of such a
super-orbital period. Fitting the 0.3--10 keV Swift XRT luminosity lightcurve
with a sinusoid yielded a period of 5.65+/-0.05 days, and a >5$\sigma$
improvement in $\chi^2$ over the best fit constant intensity model. A
Lomb-Scargle periodogram revealed that periods 5.4--5.8 days were detected at a
>3$\sigma$ level, with a peak at 5.6 days. We consider this strong evidence for
a 5.65 day super-orbital period, ~70\% longer than the predicted period. The
0.3--10 keV luminosity varied by a factor ~5, consistent with variations seen
in long-term monitoring from Chandra. We conclude that other X-ray binaries
exhibiting similar long-term behaviour are likely to also be X-ray binaries
with low mass ratios and super-orbital periods.

gap-edge vortices have thus far employed locally isothermal discs, but the
theory of this vortex-forming or `Rossby wave' instability was originally
developed for adiabatic discs. We generalise the study of planetary gap
stability to non-isothermal discs using customised numerical simulations of
disc-planet systems where the planet opens an unstable gap. We include in the
energy equation a simple cooling function with cooling timescale
$t_c=\beta\Omega_k^{-1}$, where $\Omega_k$ is the Keplerian frequency, and
examine the effect of $\beta$ on the stability of gap edges and vortex
lifetimes. We find increasing $\beta$ lowers the growth rate of
non-axisymmetric perturbations, and the dominant azimuthal wavenumber $m$
decreases. We find a quasi-steady state consisting of one large-scale,
over-dense vortex circulating the outer gap edge, typically lasting $O(10^3)$
orbits. Vortex lifetimes were found to generally increase with cooling times up
to an optimal value, beyond which vortex lifetimes decrease. This non-monotonic
dependence is qualitatively consistent with recent studies using strictly
isothermal discs that vary the disc aspect ratio.

photoionization heating and the explosion of massive stars as supernovae (SNe).
Our reference simulation, which was carried out in a box of size 25 comoving
Mpc/h using 2 x 512^3 particles, produces a reasonable reionization history and
matches the observed UV luminosity function of galaxies. Simulations with
different box sizes and resolutions are used to investigate numerical
convergence, and simulations in which either SNe or photoionization heating or
both are turned off, are used to investigate the role of feedback from star
formation. Ionizing radiation is treated using accurate radiative transfer at
the high spatially adaptive resolution at which the hydrodynamics is carried
out. SN feedback strongly reduces the star formation rates (SFRs) over nearly
the full mass range of simulated galaxies and is required to yield SFRs in
agreement with observations. Photoheating helps to suppress star formation in
low-mass galaxies, but its impact on the cosmic SFR is small. Because the
effect of photoheating is masked by the strong SN feedback, it does not imprint
a signature on the UV galaxy luminosity function, although we note that our
resolution is insufficient to model star-forming minihaloes cooling through
molecular hydrogen transitions. Photoheating does provide a strong positive
feedback on reionization because it smooths density fluctuations in the IGM,
which lowers the IGM recombination rate substantially. Our simulations
demonstrate a tight non-linear coupling of galaxy formation and reionization,
motivating the need for the accurate and simultaneous inclusion of photoheating
and SN feedback in models of the early Universe.

\cite{Berti+14} suggest that ultra-high-energy particles can emerge from

involves a particle on an outgoing trajectory very close to the black hole.
Clearly such a particle cannot emerge from the black hole. It is argued
\cite{Berti+14} that this particle can arise in another collision. Thus the
process involves two collisions: one in which an outgoing particle is produced
extremely close to the horizon, and a second one in which energy is gained. The
real efficiency of this process should take into account, therefore, the energy
needed to produce the first particle. We show here that while this process is
kinematically possible, it requires a deposition of energy that is divergently
large compared with the energy of the escaping particle. Thus, in contradiction
to claims of infinitely high efficiencies, the efficiency of the combined
process is in fact extremely small, approaching zero for very high output
energies. Even under more general conditions than those considered in
\cite{Berti+14} the total energy gain never diverges, and is larger only by a
factor of a few than the energy gain of the original collisional Penrose
process that takes place between two infalling particles

burst (GRB), and a compact remnant, neutron star mergers eject significant
masses at significant kinetic energies. This mass ejection takes place via
dynamical mass ejection and a GRB jet but other processes have also been
suggested: a shock-breakout material, a cocoon resulting from the interaction
of the jet with other ejecta, and viscous and neutrino driven winds from the
central remnant or the accretion disk. The different components of the ejected
masses include up to a few percent of a solar mass, some of which is ejected at
relativistic velocities. The interaction of these ejecta with the surrounding
interstellar medium will produce a long lasting radio flare, in a similar way
to GRB afterglows or to radio supernovae. The relative strength of the
different signals depends strongly on the viewing angle. An observer along the
jet axis or close to it will detect a strong signal at a few dozen days from
the radio afterglow (or the orphan radio afterglow) produced by the highly
relativistic GRB jet. For a generic observer at larger viewing angles, the
dynamical ejecta, whose contribution peaks a year or so after the event, will
generally dominate. Depending on the observed frequency and the external
density, other components may also give rise to a significant contribution. We
also compare these estimates with the radio signature of the short GRB 130603B.
The radio flare from the dynamical ejecta might be detectable with the EVLA and
the LOFAR for the higher range of external densities $n\gtrsim 0.5{\rm

discover several relative periodic orbits (RPOs) embedded within a subregion of
the chaotic turbulent saddle. We also extract directly from simulation, several
travelling waves (TWs). These TWs together with the RPOs are unstable states
and are believed to provide the skeleton of the chaotic saddle. Earlier studies
have shown that such invariant solutions can help to explain wall bounded shear
flows, and a finite subset of them are expected to dominate the dynamics
(Faisst & Eckhardt 2003; Pringle & Kerswell 2007; Hof et al. 2004). The
introduction of symmetries is typically necessary to facilitate this approach.
Applying only the shift-reflect symmetry, the geometry is less constrained than
previous studies in pipe flow. A 'long-period' RPO is identified that is only
very weakly repelling. Turbulent trajectories are found to frequently approach
and frequently shadow this orbit. In addition the orbit characterises a
resulting 'bubble' of chaos, itself a saddle, deep within the turbulent sea
(Kreilos et al. 2014). We explicitly analyse the merger of the two saddles and
show how it results in a considerable increase of the total lifetime. Both
exits and entries to the bubble are observed, as the stable manifolds of the
inner and outer saddles intertwine. We observe that the typical lifetime of the
turbulence is influenced by switches between the inner and outer saddles, and
is thereby dependent on whether or not it 'shadows' or 'visits' the vicinity of
the long-period RPO (Cvitanovic et al. 2014). These observations, along with
comparisons of flow structures, show that RPOs play a significant role in
structuring the dynamics of turbulence.

Reynolds numbers. But can turbulence occur at low Reynolds numbers? Here we
investigate the transition to turbulence in the classic Taylor-Couette system

nanoparticles embedded in liquid carriers. We find that, in the presence of a
magnetic field turbulence can occur at Reynolds numbers that are at least one
order of magnitude smaller than those in conventional fluids. This is
established by extensive computational ferrohydrodynamics through a detailed
bifurcation analysis and characterization of behaviors of physical quantities

bifurcations. A striking finding is that, as the magnetic field is increased,
the onset of turbulence can be determined accurately and reliably. Our results

by using ferrofluids, opening up a new avenue to probe into the fundamentals of
turbulence and the challenging problem of turbulence control.

industry. Traditionally, performance of recommendation systems has been
measured by their precision. By introducing novelty and diversity as key
qualities in recommender systems, recently increasing attention has been
focused on this topic. Precision and novelty of recommendation are not in the
same direction, and practical systems should make a trade-off between these two
quantities. Thus, it is an important feature of a recommender system to make it
possible to adjust diversity and accuracy of the recommendations by tuning the
model. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic structure to resolve the
diversity-accuracy dilemma in recommender systems. We propose a hybrid model
with adjustable level of diversity and precision such that one can perform this
by tuning a single parameter. The proposed recommendation model consists of two
models: one for maximization of the accuracy and the other one for
specification of the recommendation list to tastes of users. Our experiments on
two real datasets show the functionality of the model in resolving
accuracy-diversity dilemma and outperformance of the model over other classic
models. The proposed method could be extensively applied to real commercial
systems due to its low computational complexity and significant performance.

so-called Configurational Entropy (CE) for travelling solitons, which we name
as travelling Configurational Entropy (TCE), shows that the best value of
parameter responsible to break the Lorentz symmetry is one where the energy
density is distributed equally around the origin. In this way, the
information-theoretical measure of travelling solitons in Lorentz symmetry
violation scenarios opens a new window to probe situations where the parameters
responsible for breaking the symmetries are random. In this case, the TCE
selects the best value.

developed turbulence. Prior to the onset of turbulence we observe intermittent
burst patterns of localized turbulent patches, confirming the experimentally
observed pattern of very short wavelength bursts (VSWBs). A striking finding is
that, for Reynolds number larger than the onset of VSWBs, a new type of
intermittently bursting behaviors emerge: burst patterns of azimuthally closed
rings of various orders. We call them ring-burst patterns, which surround the
cylinder completely but remain localized and separated by non-turbulent mostly
wavy structures in the axial direction. We use a number of quantitative
measures, including the cross-flow energy, to characterize the ring-burst
patterns and to distinguish them from the background flow. The ring-burst
patterns are interesting because it does not occur in either three- or
two-dimensional Taylor-Couette flow: it occurs only in the transition, quasi
two-dimensional regime of the system, a regime that is less studied but
certainly deserves further attention so as to obtain deeper insights into
turbulence.

posed so that the wave equation dynamics and temporal boundary data of interest

of terminal payoff respectively. In order to solve this optimal control problem
for any such terminal payoff, and hence solve any two-point boundary value

Specifically, the optimal control problem corresponding to any given terminal

shown to be a quadratic functional that is defined with respect to the unique
solution of a set of operator differential equations, and computable using
spectral methods. An example is presented in which this fundamental solution is

bodies are initially non-hierarchical and undergo chaotic motions, while
accreting using Bondi-Hoyle accretion. The coupling of dynamics and accretion
often leads to one or two dominant bodies controlling the center of the cloud
core, while banishing the other(s) to the lower-density outskirts, leading to
stunted growth. Eventually each system transforms either to a bound
hierarchical configuration or breaks apart into separate single and binary
components. The orbital motion is followed for 100 Myr. To illustrate the
simulations we introduce the 'triple diagnostic diagram', which plots two
dimensionless numbers against each other, representing the binary mass ratio
and the mass ratio of the third body to the total system mass. Numerous
freefloating BD binaries are formed in these simulations. The separation
distribution function is in good correspondence with observations, showing a
steep rise at close separations, peaking around 13 AU and then declining more
gently. Unresolved BD triple systems may appear as wider BD binaries. Mass
ratios are strongly peaked towards unity, as observed, but this is partially
due to the initial assumptions. Eccentricities gradually increase towards
higher values, due to the lack of viscous interactions in the simulations,
which would both shrink the orbits and decrease their eccentricities. The main
threat to newly born triple systems is internal instabilities, not external
perturbations. Dynamical interactions in newborn triple systems of stellar
embryos embedded in and accreting from a cloud core naturally form a population
of freefloating BD binaries, and this mechanism may constitute a significant

an ingested food bolus from the pharynx to the stomach via the esophagus, a
multi-layered muscular tube. This process involves interactions between the
bolus, the esophagus, and the neurally coordinated activation of the esophageal
muscles. In this work, we use an immersed boundary (IB) approach to simulate
peristaltic transport in the esophagus. The bolus is treated as a viscous fluid
that is actively transported by the muscular esophagus, which is modeled as an
actively contracting, fiber-reinforced tube. A simplified version of our model
is verified by comparison to an analytic solution to the tube dilation problem.
Three different complex models of the multi-layered esophagus, which differ in
their activation patterns and the layouts of the mucosal layers, are then
extensively tested. To our knowledge, these simulations are the first of their
kind to incorporate the bolus, the multi-layered esophagus tube, and muscle
activation into an integrated model. Consistent with experimental observations,
our simulations capture the pressure peak generated by the muscle activation
pulse that travels along the bolus tail. These fully resolved simulations
provide new insights into roles of the mucosal layers during bolus transport.
In addition, the information on pressure and the kinematics of the esophageal
wall due to the coordination of muscle activation is provided, which may help
relate clinical data from manometry and ultrasound images to the underlying
esophageal motor function.

hole at a galac- tic center pose a challenge to our understanding of accretion
processes. Within a month the accretion rate reaches super-Eddington levels. It
then drops gradually over a time scale of a year to sub-Eddington regimes. The
initially geometrically thick disk becomes a thin one and eventually an ADAF at
very low accretion rates. As such, TDEs explore the whole range of accretion
rates and configurations. A challenging question is what the corresponding
light curves of these events are. We explore numerically the disk luminosity
and the conditions within the inner region of the disk using a fully general
relativistic slim disk model. Those conditions determine the magnitude of the
magnetic field that engulfs the black hole and this, in turn, determines the
Blandford-Znajek jet power. We estimate this power in two different ways and
show that they are self-consistent. We find, as expected earlier from analytic
argu- ments (Krolik & Piran 2012), that neither the disk luminosity nor the jet
power follows the accretion rate throughout the disruption event. The disk
luminosity varies only logarithmi- cally with the accretion rate at
super-Eddington luminosities. The jet power follows initially the accretion
rate but remains a constant after the transition from super- to sub- Eddington.
At lower accretion rates at the end of the MAD phase the disk becomes thin and
the jet may stop altogether. These new estimates of the jet power and disk
luminosity that do not simply follow the mass fallback rate should be taken
into account when searching for TDEs and analysing light curves of TDE
candidates. Identification of some of the above mentioned transitions may
enable us to estimate better TDE parameters.

presence of an Ha emission line. The spectra of several sources revealed an Ha
emission line only after careful subtraction of the F or G stellar spectral
absorption lines. In a sub-class of three of these sources the residual Halpha
emission line is broad (> 400 km/s) which suggests that it is formed in an
accretion disk, whereas in other cases the line width is such that we currently
cannot determine whether the line emission is formed in an active star/binary
or in an accretion disk. GBS source CX377 shows this hidden accretion behaviour
most dramatically. The previously-identified broad Ha emission of this source
is not present in its Gemini spectra taken about 1 year later. However, broad
emission is revealed after subtracting an F6 template star spectrum. The Gemini
spectra of three sources (CX446, CX1004, and CXB2) as well as the presence of
possible eclipses in light curves of these sources suggest that these sources

model time-out and preemption actions. The goal of this paper is to explore the
expressive power of tccp to describe hybrid systems. We introduce the language
Hy-tccp as a conservative extension of tccp, by adding a notion of continuous
time and new constructs to describe the continuous dynamics of hybrid systems.
In this paper, we present the syntax and the operational semantics of Hy-tccp
together with some examples that show the expressive power of our new language.

are an important problem, because templates usually contain irrelevant
information such as advertisements, menus, and banners. Processing and storing
this information is likely to lead to a waste of resources (storage space,

50% of data on the Web. Therefore, identifying templates is essential for

  Under the assumption that the shrinking of grain sizes is due to the

priors on physical properties of galaxies. This concept is particularly suited
for upcoming/on-going large imaging surveys, in which only several broad-band
filters are available and it is hard to break some of the degeneracies in the
multi-color space. We construct model templates of galaxies using a stellar
population synthesis code and apply Bayesian priors on physical properties such
as stellar mass and star formation rate. These priors are a function of
redshift and they effectively evolve the templates with time in an
observationally motivated way. We demonstrate that the priors help reduce the
degeneracy and deliver significantly improved photometric redshifts.
Furthermore, we show that a template error function, which corrects for
systematic flux errors in the model templates as a function of rest-frame
wavelength, delivers further improvements. One great advantage of our technique
is that we simultaneously measure redshifts and physical properties of galaxies
in a fully self-consistent manner, unlike the two-step measurements with
different templates often performed in the literature. One may rightly worry
that the physical priors bias the inferred galaxy properties, but we show that
the bias is smaller than systematic uncertainties inherent in physical
properties inferred from the SED fitting and hence is not a major issue. We
will extensively test and tune the priors in the on-going Hyper Suprime-Cam
survey and will make the code publicly available in the future.

through adsorption-desorption Langmuir (LK) kinetics of the motors. We analyse
this model within the framework of a Mean Field (MF) theory in the limit of
{\it weak} interactions between the motors. We point to the mapping of this
model with the non-conserved version of Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn (KLS) model. The
system exhibits rich phase behavior with variety of inhomogeneous phases
including localized shocks in the bulk of the filament. We obtain the steady
state density and current profiles and analyse their variation as function of
the strength of interaction. We compare these MF results with Monte Carlo
simulations and find that the MF analysis shows reasonably good agreement as
long as the motors are weakly interacting. We also construct the
non-equilibrium MF phase diagram.

convergence maps of 25 ${\rm deg}^2$ field-of-view, and use them to examine the
ability of the following three lensing statistics as cosmological probes; power
spectrum, peak counts, and Minkowski functionals. For the upcoming wide-field
observations such as Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with a sky coverage
of 1400 ${\rm deg}^2$, these three statistics provide tight constraints on the
matter density, density fluctuation amplitude, and dark energy equation of
state, but parameter bias is induced by the baryonic processes such as gas
cooling and stellar feedback. The bias can be significant when the statistical
errors become small in future observations with a much larger survey area. We
find the bias is induced in different directions in the parameter space
depending on the statistics employed. While the two-point statistic, i.e. power
spectrum, yields robust results against baryonic effects, the overall
constraining power is weak compared with peak counts and Minkowski functionals.
On the other hand, using one of peak counts or Minkowski functionals, or
combined analysis with multiple statistics, results in biased parameter
estimate. The bias can be as large as $1\sigma$ for HSC survey, and will be
more significant for upcoming wider area surveys. We suggest to use an
optimized combination so that the baryonic effects on parameter estimation are
mitigated. Such `calibrated' combination can place stringent and robust
constraints on cosmological parameters.

Stateful IDS can store the state of the protocol and use it for better
detection of malware. In the case of TCP/IP networks, an attacker can also
launch an attack such that the malicious code is distributed over many packets.
These packets pass through the traditional IDS/ IPS and reassemble inside the
network. Once re-assembled inside the network by the TCP/IP layer, the
malicious code launches an attack.
  The TCP state and a copy of last few packets for each active connection has
to be maintained in IDS/IPS. In TCP re-assembly, packets are re-assembled at
IDS/IPS and searched for signature matches. A connection table has to be
maintained for active connections and their list of last few (atmost 11)
packets that have already arrived. We need data structures for searching the
connection that the latest incoming packet belongs to. Popular hashing
algorithms like CRC, XOR, summing tuple, taking modulus are inefficient as hash
keys are not evenly distributed in hash-key space. Thus we show how an

bursts observed from 40 sources by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, introducing
a multiplicative factor $f_a$ to the persistent emission contribution in our
spectral fits. We found that for the majority of spectra the best-fit value of
$f_a$ is significantly greater than 1, suggesting that the persistent emission
typically increases during a burst. Elevated $f_a$ values were not found solely
during the radius expansion interval of the burst, but were also measured in
the cooling tail. The modified model results in a lower average value of the
$\chi^2$ fit statistic, indicating superior spectral fits, but not yet to the
level of formal statistical consistency for all the spectra.
  We interpret the elevated $f_a$ values as an increase of the mass accretion
rate onto the neutron star during the burst, likely arising from the effects of
Poynting-Robertson drag on the disk material. We measured an inverse
correlation of $f_a$ with the persistent flux, consistent with theoretical
models of the disc response. We suggest that this modified approach may provide
more accurate burst spectral parameters, as well as offering a probe of the

detectors about 210 m away from the interaction point and very close to the
beamline (2-3 mm). This implies the need of slim edges of about 100-200 $\mu$m
width for the sensor side facing the beam to minimise the dead area. Another
challenge is an expected non-uniform irradiation of the pixel sensors. It is
studied if these requirements can be met using slightly-modified FE-I4 3D pixel
sensors from the ATLAS Insertable B-Layer production. AFP-compatible slim edges
are obtained with a simple diamond-saw cut. Electrical characterisations and
beam tests are carried out and no detrimental impact on the leakage current and
hit efficiency is observed. For devices without a 3D guard ring a remaining
insensitive edge of less than 15 $\mu$m width is found. Moreover, 3D detectors
are non-uniformly irradiated up to fluences of several 10$^{15}$
n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$ with either a focussed 23 GeV proton beam or a 23 MeV proton
beam through holes in Al masks. The efficiency in the irradiated region is
found to be similar to the one in the non-irradiated region and exceeds 97% in
case of favourable chip-parameter settings. Only in a narrow transition area at
the edge of the hole in the Al mask, a significantly lower efficiency is seen.
A follow-up study of this effect using arrays of small pad diodes for
position-resolved dosimetry via the leakage current is carried out.

there has also been mounting evidence that compact binary mergers could be
major sources of heavy elements and these ideas have gained recent
observational support from the detection of an event that has been interpreted
as a ""macronova"", an electromagnetic transient powered by freshly produced,

most plausible triggers of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) and the last decade
has witnessed the first detection of a sGRB afterglow and subsequent

larger radii than that of a passively cooling planet. The extreme irradiation
$L_{\rm eq}$ these hot Jupiters receive from their close in stars creates a
thick isothermal layer in their envelopes, which slows down their convective
cooling, allowing them to retain their inflated size for longer. This is yet
insufficient to explain the observed sizes of the most inflated planets. Some
models invoke an additional power source, deposited deep in the planet's
envelope. Here we present an analytical model for the cooling of such
irradiated, and internally heated gas giants. We show that a power source
$L_{\rm dep}$, deposited at an optical depth $\tau_{\rm dep}$, creates an
exterior convective region, between optical depths $L_{\rm eq}/L_{\rm dep}$ and
$\tau_{\rm dep}$, beyond which a thicker isothermal layer exists, which in
extreme cases may extend to the center of the planet. This convective layer,
which occurs only for $L_{\rm dep}\tau_{\rm dep}>L_{\rm eq}$, further delays
the cooling of the planet. Such a planet is equivalent to a planet irradiated
with $L_{\rm eq}\left(1+L_{\rm dep}\tau_{\rm dep}/L_{\rm eq}\right)^\beta$,
where $\beta\approx 0.35$ is an effective power-law index describing the
radiative energy density as function of the optical depth for a convective
planet $U\propto\tau^\beta$. Our simple analytical model reproduces the main
trends found in previous numerical works, and provides an intuitive
understanding. We derive scaling laws for the cooling rate of the planet, its
central temperature, and radius. These scaling laws can be used to estimate the
effects of tidal or Ohmic dissipation, wind shocks, or any other mechanism
involving energy deposition, on sizes of hot Jupiters.

that these decay modes provide evidence for a 3-quark nature of $N^*$

was behind work we did previously involving a localization phase transition: at
low pressure the molecules are delocalized between the two minima of the
potential energy while at higher pressure they become localized in one minimum
due to the intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Evidence for such a
transition is provided by measurements of the inversion spectrum of ammonia and
deuterated ammonia at different pressures. A previously proposed model gives a
satisfactory account of the empirical results without free parameters. In this

a phase transition takes place at a critical pressure which depends on the

the deduced INOV characteristics of the RQWLQs then compared with those
published recently for several prominent AGN classes, also applying the F-test.
From our existing INOV observations, there is a hint that RQWLQs in our sample
show a significantly higher INOV duty cycle than radio-quiet quasars and radio
lobe-dominated quasars. Two sessions when we have detected strong (blazar-like)
INOV for RQWLQs are pointed out, and these two RQWLQs are therefore the best
known candidates for radio-quiet BL Lacs, deserving to be pursued. For a proper
comparison with the INOV properties already established for (brighter) members

playing a lead role in precision cosmology by providing some of the tightest
constrains on cosmological models and parameters. However, precision can only
be meaningful when all major systematic effects are taken into account.
Non-circular beams in CMB experiments can cause large systematic deviation in
the angular power spectrum, not only by modifying the measurement at a given
multipole, but also introducing coupling between different multipoles through a
deterministic bias matrix. Here we add a mechanism for emulating the effect of
a full bias matrix to the Planck likelihood code through the parameter
estimation code SCoPE. We show that if the angular power spectrum was measured
with a non-circular beam, the assumption of circular Gaussian beam or
considering only the diagonal part of the bias matrix can lead to huge error in
parameter estimation. We demonstrate that, at least for elliptical Gaussian
beams, use of scalar beam window functions obtained via Monte Carlo simulations
starting from a fiducial spectrum, as implemented in Planck analyses for
example, leads to em only few percent of sigma deviation of the best-fit
parameters. However, we notice more significant differences in the posterior
distributions for some of the parameters, which would in turn lead to incorrect
errorbars. These differences can be reduced, so that the errorbars match within
few percent, by adding an iterative reanalysis step, where the beam window
function would be recomputed using the best-fit spectrum estimated in the first
step.

'true' foreground can be labeled as background and features like minutiae can
be lost, or conversely 'true' background can be misclassified as foreground and
spurious features can be introduced. The contribution of this paper is
threefold: firstly, we propose a novel factorized directional bandpass (FDB)

presents very good results for bypass transition under zero-pressure gradient

predict separation induced transition. However, for very low speed and low

for any finite group $G$. This work is motivated by the fact that any
$G$-Frobenius algebra yields an ordinary Frobenius algebra by taking its
$G$-invariants. We generalize this on the level of Frobenius manifolds.
  To define a $G$-Frobenius manifold as a braided-commutative generalization of
the ordinary commutative Frobenius manifold, we develop the theory of
$G$-braided spaces. These are defined as $G$-graded $G$-modules with certain
braided-commutative ""rings of functions"", generalizing the commutative rings of
power series on ordinary vector spaces.
  As the genus zero part of any ordinary cohomological field theory of
Kontsevich-Manin contains a Frobenius manifold, we show that any
$G$-cohomological field theory defined by Jarvis-Kaufmann-Kimura contains a
$G$-Frobenius manifold up to a rescaling of its metric.
  Finally, we specialize to the case of $G = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ and prove
the structure theorem for (pre-)$\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-Frobenius manifolds.
We also construct an example of a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-Frobenius manifold
using this theorem, that arises in singularity theory in the hypothetical
context of orbifolding.

underdense regions expand whereas others collapse due to overdense surrounding
regions, we explored the interplay between the void inner dynamics and its
large scale environment. The environment is classified depending on its density
as in previous works. We analyse the dynamical properties of void-centered
spherical shells at different void-centric distances depending on this
classification. The above dynamical properties are given by the angular
distribution of the radial velocity field, its smoothness, the field dependence
on the tracer density and shape, and the field departures from linear theory.
We found that the velocity field in expanding voids follows more closely the
linear prediction, with a more smooth velocity field. However when using
velocity tracers with large densities such deviations increase. Voids with
sizes around $18\,h^{-1}\,Mpc$ are in a transition regime between regions with
expansion overpredicted and underpredicted from linear theory. We also found
that velocity smoothness increases as the void radius, indicating the laminar
flow dominates the expansion of larger voids (more than $18\,h^{-1}\,Mpc$). The
correlations observed suggest that nonlinear dynamics of the inner regions of
voids could be dependent on the evolution of the surrounding structures. These
also indicate possible scale couplings between the void inner expansion and the
large scale regions where voids are embedded. These results shed some light to
the origin of nonlinearities in voids, going beyond the fact that voids just
quickly becomes nonlinear as they become emptier.

modifications in different molecular structures, able to store biochemical
information that is not encoded by the DNA. Some of these covalent mark
patterns can be transmitted across generations (epigenetic changes). Recently,
the emergence of Hopfield-like attractor dynamics has been observed in the
self-organized enzymatic networks, which have the capacity to store functional
catalytic patterns that can be correctly recovered by the specific input
stimuli. The Hopfield-like metabolic dynamics are stable and can be maintained
as a long-term biochemical memory. In addition, specific molecular information
can be transferred from the functional dynamics of the metabolic networks to
the enzymatic activity involved in the covalent post-translational modulation
so that determined functional memory can be embedded in multiple stable
molecular marks. Both the metabolic dynamics governed by Hopfield-type
attractors (functional processes) and the enzymatic covalent modifications of
determined molecules (structural dynamic processes) seem to represent the two
stages of the dynamical memory of cellular metabolism (metabolic memory).
Epigenetic processes appear to be the structural manifestation of this cellular
metabolic memory. Here, a new framework for molecular information storage in
the cell is presented, which is characterized by two functionally and
molecularly interrelated systems: a dynamic, flexible and adaptive system
(metabolic memory) and an essentially conservative system (genetic memory). The
molecular information of both systems seems to coordinate the physiological

Examples of successful projects are Galaxy Zoo and FoldIt. A key feature of
this kind of project is its capacity to engage volunteers. An important
requirement for the proposal and evaluation of new engagement strategies is
having a clear understanding of the typical engagement of the volunteers;
however, even though several projects of this kind have already been completed,
little is known about this issue. In this paper, we investigate the engagement
pattern of the volunteers in their interactions in human computation for
citizen science projects, how they differ among themselves in terms of
engagement, and how those volunteer engagement features should be taken into
account for establishing the engagement encouragement strategies that should be
brought into play in a given project. To this end, we define four quantitative
engagement metrics to measure different aspects of volunteer engagement, and
use data mining algorithms to identify the different volunteer profiles in
terms of the engagement metrics. Our study is based on data collected from two
projects: Galaxy Zoo and The Milky Way Project. The results show that the
volunteers in such projects can be grouped into five distinct engagement
profiles that we label as follows: hardworking, spasmodic, persistent, lasting,
and moderate. The analysis of these profiles provides a deeper understanding of
the nature of volunteers' engagement in human computation for citizen science

special arborescent knots and many knots whose ordinary Alexander polynomial is
trivial. This theorem follows from results showing that the tautness of certain
sutured manifolds can be certified by checking that they are a product from the
point of view of homology with coefficients twisted by an SL(2,

quantities, from the perspective of special relativity. Using the well-known
formula for propagating statistical errors, we prove that the uncertainty
relations between the moduli of conjugate observables are not relativistically
invariant. The new relationships show that, in experiments involving
relativistic particles, limitations of the precision of a quantity obtained by
indirect calculations may affect the final result.

statistical evidence. We consider the case of association rules, relevant
e.g.~for query and product recommendations. For example: Suppose that a
customer belongs to categories A and B, each of which is known to have positive
correlation with buying product C, how do we estimate the probability that she
will buy product C?
  For rare terms or products there may not be enough data to directly produce
such an estimate --- perhaps we never directly observed a connection between A,
B, and C. What can we do when there is no support for estimating the
probability by simply computing the observed frequency? In particular, what is
the right thing to do when A and B give rise to very different estimates of the
probability of C?
  We consider the use of maximum entropy probability estimates, which give a
principled way of extrapolating probabilities of events that do not even occur
in the data set! Focusing on the basic case of three variables, our main
technical contributions are that (under mild assumptions): 1) There exists a
simple, explicit formula that gives a good approximation of maximum entropy
estimates, and 2) Maximum entropy estimates based on a small number of samples
are provably tightly concentrated around the true maximum entropy frequency
that arises if we let the number of samples go to infinity.
  Our empirical work demonstrates the surprising precision of maximum entropy
estimates, across a range of real-life transaction data sets. In particular we
observe the average absolute error on maximum entropy estimates is a factor
$3$--$14$ less compared to using independence or extrapolation estimates, when
the data used to make the estimates has low support. We believe that the same
principle can be used to synthesize probability estimates in many settings.

small shortest path length independent of system size. Tuning the inverse

  informative missingness",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear quantile regression models aim at providing a detailed and robust
picture of the (conditional) response distribution as function of a set of
observed covariates. Longitudinal data represent an interesting field of
application of such models; due to their peculiar features, they represent a
substantial challenge, in that the standard, cross-sectional, model
representation needs to be extended for dealing with such kind of data. In
fact, repeated observations from the same statistical unit poses a problem of
dependence; in a conditional perspective, this dependence could be ascribed to
sources of unobserved, individual-specific, heterogeneity. Along these lines,
quantile regression models have recently been extended to the analysis of
longitudinal, continuous, responses, by modelling dependence via time-constant
or time-varying random effects. In this manuscript, we introduce a general
quantile regression model for longitudinal, continuous, responses where
time-varying and time-constant random parameters are jointly taken into
account. A further feature of longitudinal designs is the presence of partially
incomplete sequences, due to some individuals leaving the study before its
designed end. The missing data process may produce a selection of units which
can be informative with respect to the parameters of the longitudinal data
model. To deal with the case of irretrievable drop-out, we introduce a pattern
mixture version of the linear quantile hidden Markov model, where we account
for time-varying heterogeneity and for changes in the fixed effect vector due
to differential propensities to stay in the study. The proposed models are
illustrated using a well known benchmark dataset on longitudinal dynamics of
CD4 cells and by means of a large scale simulation study, entailing different
quantiles and both complete and partially complete (ie subject to drop-out)
individual sequences.

rise to exceptionally intense activity in the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
Based on February to September 2014 SINFONI observations. The detection of
spatially compact and red-shifted hydrogen recombination line emission allows a
us to obtain a new estimate of the orbital parameters of the DSO. We have not
detected strong pre-pericenter blue-shifted or post-pericenter red-shifted
emission above the noise level at the position of SgrA* or upstream the orbit.
The periapse position was reached in May 2014. Our 2004-2012 infrared
polarization statistics shows that SgrA* must be a very stable system - both in
terms of geometrical orientation of a jet or accretion disk and in terms of the
variability spectrum which must be linked to the accretion rate. Hence
polarization and variability measurements are the ideal tool to probe for any
change in the system as a function of the DSO/G2 fly-by. Due to the 2014 fly-by

feature in order to provide availability and fault-tolerance. Attiya and Welch
proved that using strong consistency criteria such as atomicity is costly as
each operation may need an execution time linear with the latency of the
communication network. Weaker consistency criteria like causal consistency and
PRAM consistency do not ensure convergence. The different replicas are not
guaranteed to converge towards a unique state. Eventual consistency guarantees
that all replicas eventually converge when the participants stop updating.
However, it fails to fully specify the semantics of the operations on shared
objects and requires additional non-intuitive and error-prone distributed
specification techniques. This paper introduces and formalizes a new
consistency criterion, called update consistency, that requires the state of a
replicated object to be consistent with a linearization of all the updates. In
other words, whereas atomicity imposes a linearization of all of the
operations, this criterion imposes this only on updates. Consequently some read
operations may return out-dated values. Update consistency is stronger than
eventual consistency, so we can replace eventually consistent objects with
update consistent ones in any program. Finally, we prove that update
consistency is universal, in the sense that any object can be implemented under
this criterion in a distributed system where any number of nodes may crash.

the chemical history of stars pre- and post-planet formation. Binary host stars
of similar type present an opportunity to isolate the effects of planets on
host star abundances. Here we present a differential elemental abundance
analysis of the XO-2 stellar binary, in which both G9 stars host giant planets,

elemental abundances and compare the $\Delta$(XO-2N-XO-S) values to elemental

differences between the stars depend on the chosen stellar parameters, but that
Fe, Si, and potentially Ni are consistently enhanced in XO-2N regardless of the
chosen stellar parameters. This study emphasizes the power of binary host star
abundance analysis for probing the effects of giant planet formation, but also
illustrates the potentially large uncertainties in abundance differences and

far more sensitive than Planck and will have a diffraction-limited angular

perform substantially better than Planck for studies of extragalactic sources.
The source detection limits as a function of frequency have been estimated by
means of realistic simulations. The most significant improvements over Planck
results are presented for each option. COrE+ will provide much larger samples
of truly local star-forming galaxies, making possible analyses of the
properties of galaxies (luminosity functions, dust mass functions, star
formation rate functions, dust temperature distributions, etc.) across the
Hubble sequence. Even more interestingly, COrE+ will detect, at |b|> 30 deg,
thousands of strongly gravitationally lensed galaxies. Such large samples are
of extraordinary astrophysical and cosmological value in many fields. Moreover,
COrE+ high frequency maps will be optimally suited to pick up proto-clusters of
dusty galaxies, i.e. to investigate the evolution of large scale structure at
larger redshifts than can be reached by other means. Thanks to its high
sensitivity COrE+ will also yield a spectacular advance in the blind detection

studies of radio source polarization and of the global properties of magnetic

fault-tolerance of massive distributed applications over large scale systems
such as the Internet. However, these systems are prone to partitioning, which
by Brewer's CAP theorem [1] makes it impossible to use a strong consistency
criterion like atomicity. Eventual consistency [2] guaranties that all replicas
eventually converge to a common state when the participants stop updating.
However, it fails to fully specify shared objects and requires additional
non-intuitive and error-prone distributed specification techniques, that must
take into account all possible concurrent histories of updates to specify this
common state [3]. This approach, that can lead to specifications as complicated
as the implementations themselves, is limited by a more serious issue. The
concurrent specification of objects uses the notion of concurrent events. In
message-passing systems, two events are concurrent if they are enforced by
different processes and each process enforced its event before it received the
notification message from the other process. In other words, the notion of
concurrency depends on the implementation of the object, not on its
specification. Consequently, the final user may not know if two events are
concurrent without explicitly tracking the messages exchanged by the processes.
A specification should be independent of the system on which it is implemented.
We believe that an object should be totally specified by two facets: its
abstract data type, that characterizes its sequential executions, and a
consistency criterion, that defines how it is supposed to behave in a
distributed environment. Not only sequential specification helps repeal the
problem of intention, it also allows to use the well studied and understood
notions of languages and automata. This makes possible to apply all the tools
developed for sequential systems, from their simple definition using structures
and classes to the most advanced techniques like model checking and formal
verification. Eventual consistency (EC) imposes no constraint on the convergent
state, that very few depends on the sequential specification. For example, an
implementation that ignores all the updates is eventually consistent, as all
replicas converge to the initial state. We propose a new consistency criterion,
update consistency (UC), in which the convergent state must be obtained by a
total ordering of the updates, that contains the sequential order of each

transport equations with diffusive scalings. It is an extension of the time
splitting developed by Jin, Pareschi and Toscani [SINUM,2000], but uses spatial
discretizations on staggered grids, which preserves the discrete diffusion
limit with a more compact stencil. The first novelty of this paper is that we
propose a staggering in two dimensions that requires fewer unknowns than one
could have naively expected. The second contribution of this paper is that we
rigorously analyze the scheme of Jin, Pareschi, and Toscani [SINUM,2000] We
show that the scheme is AP and obtain an explicit CFL condition, which couples
a hyperbolic and a parabolic condition. This type of condition is common for
asymptotic preserving schemes and guarantees uniform stability with respect to
the mean free path. In addition, we obtain an upper bound on the relaxation
parameter, which is the crucial parameter of the used time discretization.
Several numerical examples are provided to verify the accuracy and asymptotic

properties to underlying system dynamics, and notice that often when extreme
events occur the system dynamics adopts (at least locally) an oscillatory

e^2/\hbar c$ in cosmology has been reported in analysis of combination Keck and
VLT data. This paper studies this variation based on consideration of basic
spacetime symmetry in physics. Both laboratory $\alpha_0$ and distant
$\alpha_z$ are deduced from relativistic spectrum equations of atoms
(e.g.,hydrogen atom) defined in inertial reference system. When Einstein's
$\Lambda\neq 0$, the metric of local inertial reference systems in SM of
cosmology is Beltrami metric instead of Minkowski, and the basic spacetime
symmetry has to be de Sitter (dS) group. The corresponding special relativity
(SR) is dS-SR. A model based on dS-SR is suggested. Comparing the predictions
on $\alpha$-varying with the data, the parameters are determined. The best-fit
dipole mode in $\alpha$'s spatial varying is reproduced by this dS-SR model.
$\alpha$-varyings in whole sky is also studied. The results are generally in
agreement with the estimations of observations. The main conclusion is that the
phenomenon of $\alpha$-varying cosmologically with dipole mode dominating is
due to the de Sitter (or anti de Sitter) spacetime symmetry with a Minkowski
point in an extended special relativity called de Sitter invariant special
relativity (dS-SR) developed by

on the estimation and predictive capability of Central Composite Designs
