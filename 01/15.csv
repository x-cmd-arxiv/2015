facts of financial series, including the multi-scaling of moments. The
volatility evolves according to a generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with

  Using large deviations techniques, we determine the asymptotic shape of the

usually relies on the homogeneity of optical properties of the constituent
materials. However, when the x-ray energy is tuned to an absorption edge, this
homogeneity no longer exists. Within the same material, spatial regions
containing elements at resonance will have optical properties very different
from regions without resonating sites. In this situation, models assuming
homogeneous optical properties throughout the material can fail to describe the
reflectivity adequately. As we show here, resonant soft x-ray reflectivity is
sensitive to these variations, even though the wavelength is typically large as
compared to the atomic distances over which the optical properties vary. We
have therefore developed a scheme for analyzing resonant soft x-ray
reflectivity data, which takes the atomic structure of a material into account
by ""slicing"" it into atomic planes with characteristic optical properties.
Using LaSrMnO4 as an example, we discuss both the theoretical and experimental
implications of this approach. Our analysis not only allows to determine
important structural information such as interface terminations and stacking of
atomic layers, but also enables to extract depth-resolved spectroscopic
information with atomic resolution, thus enhancing the capability of the
technique to study emergent phenomena at surfaces and interfaces.

its packet, the higher the probability that this packet is decoded by other

vehicular networks. The results show that the proposed protocol greatly
increases the number of users in the network that reliably communicate with

real-time over several respiratory cycles, forming a comprehensive picture of
tumor movement. We developed and validated a method which uses these
projections to determine the trajectory of and dose to highly mobile tumors
during each fraction of treatment.
  Methods: CBCT images of a respiration phantom were acquired, the trajectory
of which mimicked a lung tumor with high amplitude (up to 2.5 cm) and
hysteresis. A template-matching algorithm was used to identify the location of
a steel BB in each CBCT projection, and a Gaussian probability density function
for the absolute BB position was calculated which best fit the observed
trajectory of the BB in the imager geometry. Two modifications of the
trajectory reconstruction were investigated: first, using respiratory phase
information to refine the trajectory estimation (Phase), and second, using the
Monte Carlo (MC) method to sample the estimated Gaussian tumor position
distribution.
  Results: With all methods, the mean position of the BB was determined with
accuracy better than 0.1 mm, and trajectory errors averaged 3.8$\pm$1.1% of the
marker amplitude. Dosimetric calculations using Phase methods were more
accurate, with mean absolute error less than 0.5%, and with error less than 1%
in the highest-noise trajectory. MC-based trajectories prevent the
over-estimation of dose, but when viewed in an absolute sense, add a small
amount of dosimetric error (<0.1%).
  Conclusions: Marker trajectory and target dose-of-the-day were accurately
calculated using CBCT projections. This technique provides a method to evaluate
highly-mobile tumors using ordinary CBCT data, and could facilitate better
strategies to mitigate or compensate for motion during SBRT.

user association in a heterogeneous network (HetNet) with massive MIMO and
small cells, where the macro base station (BS) is equipped with a massive MIMO
and the picocell BS's are equipped with regular MIMOs. We first develop
centralized user association algorithms with proven optimality, considering
various objectives such as rate maximization, proportional fairness, and joint
user association and resource allocation. We then model the massive MIMO HetNet
as a repeated game, which leads to distributed user association algorithms with
proven convergence to the Nash Equilibrium (NE). We demonstrate the efficacy of
these optimal schemes by comparison with several greedy algorithms through
simulations.

phenomenon of freely cooling granular flows. In this work, the critical length
scale $L_c$ for the onset of instability is determined via stability analysis
of the linearized Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations of $d$-dimensional
granular binary mixtures at moderate densities. In contrast to previous
attempts, the analysis is not restricted to nearly elastic systems since it
takes into account the nonlinear dependence of the transport coefficients and
the cooling rate on the collisional dissipation. As expected from previous
results obtained in the very dilute regime, linear stability shows $d-1$
transversal (shear) modes and a longitudinal (""heat"") mode to be unstable with
respect to long enough wavelength excitations. The theoretical predictions also
show that the origin of the instability is driven by the transversal component
of the velocity field that becomes \emph{unstable} when the system length
$L>L_c$. An explicit expression of $L_c$ is obtained in terms of the masses and
diameters of the mixture, the composition, the volume fraction and the
coefficients of restitution. Previous results derived in the limit of both
mechanically equivalent particles and low-density mixtures are consistently
recovered. Finally, a comparison with previous theoretical works which neglect

dissipative gases may become unstable, for example, in granular gases, and in
molecular gases undergoing strong relaxation effects. The mechanisms
controlling these instabilities are not well understood. We successfully
isolated and investigated this instability in the canonical problem of piston
driven shock waves propagating into a medium characterized by inelastic
collision processes. We treat the standard model of granular gases, where
particle collisions are taken as inelastic with constant coefficient of
restitution. The inelasticity is activated for sufficiently strong collisions.
Molecular dynamic simulations were performed for 30,000 particles. We find that
all shock waves investigated become unstable, with density non-uniformities
forming in the relaxation region. The wavelength of these fingers is found
comparable to the characteristic relaxation thickness. Shock Hugoniot curves
for both elastic and inelastic collisions were obtained analytically and
numerically. Analysis of these curves indicate that the instability is not of
the Bethe-Zeldovich-Thompson or Dyakov-Kontorovich types. Analysis of the shock
relaxation rates and rates for clustering in a convected fluid element with the
same thermodynamic history outruled the clustering instability of a homogeneous
granular gas. Instead, wave reconstruction of the early transient evolution
indicates that the onset of instability occurs during the re-pressurization of
the gas following the initial relaxation of the medium behind the lead shock.
This re-pressurization gives rise to internal pressure waves in the presence of
strong density gradients. This indicates that the mechanism of instability is
more likely of the vorticity-generating Richtmyer-Meshkov type, relying on the
action of the inner pressure waves development during the transient relaxation.

post-regularization inference about a low-dimensional target parameter,
$\alpha$, in the presence of a very high-dimensional nuisance parameter,
$\eta$, which is estimated using modern selection or regularization methods.
Our analysis relies on high-level, easy-to-interpret conditions that allow one
to clearly see the structures needed for achieving valid post-regularization
inference. Simple, readily verifiable sufficient conditions are provided for a
class of affine-quadratic models. We focus our discussion on estimation and
inference procedures based on using the empirical analog of theoretical
equations $$M(\alpha, \eta)=0$$ which identify $\alpha$. Within this structure,
we show that setting up such equations in a manner such that the
orthogonality/immunization condition $$\partial_\eta M(\alpha, \eta) = 0$$ at
the true parameter values is satisfied, coupled with plausible conditions on
the smoothness of $M$ and the quality of the estimator $\hat \eta$, guarantees
that inference on for the main parameter $\alpha$ based on testing or point
estimation methods discussed below will be regular despite selection or
regularization biases occurring in estimation of $\eta$. In particular, the
estimator of $\alpha$ will often be uniformly consistent at the root-$n$ rate
and uniformly asymptotically normal even though estimators $\hat \eta$ will
generally not be asymptotically linear and regular. The uniformity holds over
large classes of models that do not impose highly implausible ""beta-min""
conditions. We also show that inference can be carried out by inverting tests
formed from Neyman's $C(\alpha)$ (orthogonal score) statistics.

involving a large number of interacting agents. Motivating from this
standpoint, this paper studies distributed control of networked multiagent
systems with uncertain graph topologies. The proposed framework involves a
controller architecture that has an ability to adapt its feed- back gains in
response to system variations. Specifically, we analytically show that the
proposed controller drives the trajectories of a networked multiagent system
subject to a graph topology with time-varying uncertainties to a close

in vacuum. We argue that such cascades belong to two distinct classes that are
characterized respectively by an increasing or a constant (or decreasing)
branching rate along the cascade. In the former class, of which the BDMPS,
medium-induced, cascade constitutes a typical example, it takes a finite time
to transport a finite amount of energy to very soft quanta, while this time is
essentially infinite in the latter case, to which the DGLAP cascade belongs.
The medium induced cascade is accompanied by a constant flow of energy towards
arbitrary soft modes, leading eventually to the accumulation of the initial
energy of the leading particle at zero energy. It also exhibits scaling
properties akin to wave turbulence. These properties do not show up in the
cascade that develops in vacuum. There, the energy accumulates in the spectrum
at smaller and smaller energy as the cascade develops, but the energy never
flows all the way down to zero energy. Our analysis suggests that the way the
energy is shared among the offsprings of a splitting gluon has little impact on
the qualitative properties of the cascades, provided the kernel that governs
the splittings is not too singular.

provide profiles of the complex energy landscape of biomolecules. In this
field, quantitative analyses of the data employing sound theoretical models,
have played a major role in interpreting data and anticipating outcomes of
experiments. Here, we explain how by using temperature as a variable in
mechanical unfolding of biomolecules in force spectroscopy, the roughness of
the energy landscape can be measured without making any assumptions about the
underlying reaction coordinate. Estimates of other aspects of the energy
landscape such as free energy barriers or the transition state (TS) locations
could depend on the precise model used to analyze the experimental data. We
illustrate the inherent difficulties in obtaining the transition state location
from loading rate or force-dependent unfolding rates. Because the transition
state moves as the force or the loading rate is varied, which is reminiscent of
the Hammond effect, it is in general difficult to invert the experimental data.
The independence of the TS location on force holds good only for brittle or
hard biomolecules whereas the TS location changes considerably if the molecule
is soft or plastic. Finally, we discuss the goodness of the end-to-end distance
(or pulling) coordinate of the molecule as a surrogate reaction coordinate in a

particle accelerators and can help improve the performance of an accelerator.
In this paper, we present a detailed discussion of the integrators in the spin
tracking code gpuSpinTrack. We have implemented orbital integrators based on
drift-kick, bend-kick, and matrix-kick splits. On top of the orbital
integrators, we have implemented various integrators for the spin motion. These
integrators use quaternions and Romberg quadratures to accelerate both the
computation and the convergence of spin rotations. We evaluate their
performance and accuracy in quantitative detail for individual elements as well
as for the entire RHIC lattice. We exploit the inherently data-parallel nature
of spin tracking to accelerate our algorithms on graphics processing units.

demonstrate that the largest possible singlet fraction is approximately 0.654.
This means that for systems with a sufficiently entangled ground state there is
a fundamental quantum limit to the lowest attainable energy. With local
dissipation one is unable to cool the system below some limiting non-zero

  Optimization with Finite Buffers",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One practical open problem is the development of a distributed algorithm that
achieves near-optimal utility using only a finite (and small) buffer size for
queues in a stochastic network. This paper studies utility maximization (or
cost minimization) in a finite-buffer regime and considers the corresponding
delay and reliability (or rate of packet drops) tradeoff. A floating-queue
algorithm allows the stochastic network optimization framework to be
implemented with finite buffers at the cost of packet drops. Further, the
buffer size requirement is significantly smaller than previous works in this
area. With a finite buffer size of $B$ packets, the proposed algorithm achieves
within $O(e^{-B})$ of the optimal utility while maintaining average per-hop
delay of $O(B)$ and an average per-hop drop rate of $O(e^{-B})$ in steady
state. From an implementation perspective, the floating-queue algorithm
requires little modification of the well-known Drift-Plus-Penalty policy
(including MaxWeight and Backpressure policies). As a result, the
floating-queue algorithm inherits the distributed and low complexity nature of
these policies.

around spiral galaxies. If there are 10-100 nG magnetic fields at several ten
kpc distances from the galaxies, extended galactic cosmic ray (CR) haloes could
also exist. Galactic CRs can interact with the tenuous hot halo gas to produce
observable gamma-rays. We have performed search for a gamma-ray halo around the
M31 galaxy -- the closest large spiral galaxy. Our analysis of almost 7 years
of the Fermi LAT data revealed the presence of a spatially extended diffuse
emission excess around M31. The data can be fitted using the simplest
morphology of a uniformly bright circle. The best fit gave a 4.7$\sigma$
significance for a $0.9^{\circ}$ (12 kpc) halo with a photon flux of $\sim
(3.2\pm1.0)\times 10^{-9} ~\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ and a luminosity of
$(4.0\pm1.5)\times 10^{38} ~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ in the energy range 0.3--100

corresponding gamma-ray luminosity, $5\times10^{37} ~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ is
several times smaller than the luminosity of the Milky Way. This difference
could be explained by a lower star formation rate in M31: there are less CRs
and the level of the ISM turbulence is lower, which in turn leads to a shorter

  Data","PhD dissertation, May 2014, Purdue University",,,,"q-bio.QM cs.CE cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Flow cytometry (FC) is a single-cell profiling platform for measuring the
phenotypes of individual cells from millions of cells in biological samples. FC
employs high-throughput technologies and generates high-dimensional data, and
hence algorithms for analyzing the data represent a bottleneck. This
dissertation addresses several computational challenges arising in modern
cytometry while mining information from high-dimensional and high-content
biological data. A collection of combinatorial and statistical algorithms for
locating, matching, prototyping, and classifying cellular populations from
multi-parametric FC data is developed.
  The algorithmic pipeline, flowMatch, developed in this dissertation consists
of five well-defined algorithmic modules to (1) transform data to stabilize
within-population variance, (2) identify cell populations by robust clustering
algorithms, (3) register cell populations across samples, (4) encapsulate a
class of samples with templates, and (5) classify samples based on their
similarity with the templates. Components of flowMatch can work independently
or collaborate with each other to perform the complete data analysis. flowMatch
is made available as an open-source R package in Bioconductor.
  We have employed flowMatch for classifying leukemia samples, evaluating the
phosphorylation effects on T cells, classifying healthy immune profiles, and
classifying the vaccination status of HIV patients. In these analyses, the
pipeline is able to reach biologically meaningful conclusions quickly and
efficiently with the automated algorithms. The algorithms included in flowMatch
can also be applied to problems outside of flow cytometry such as in microarray
data analysis and image recognition. Therefore, this dissertation contributes
to the solution of fundamental problems in computational cytometry and related
domains.

rules to estimate allelic frequencies and to explore their admissibility.
Decision rules with uniformly smallest risk usually do not exist and one
approach to solve this problem is to use the Bayes principle and the minimax
principle to find decision rules satisfying some general optimality criterion
based on their risk functions. Two cases were considered, the simpler case of
biallelic loci and the more complex case of multiallelic loci. For each locus,
the sampling model was a multinomial distribution and the prior was a Beta
(biallelic case) or a Dirichlet (multiallelic case) distribution. Three loss
functions were considered: squared error loss (SEL), Kulback-Leibler loss (KLL)
and quadratic error loss (QEL). Bayes estimators were derived under these three
loss functions and were subsequently used to find minimax estimators using
results from decision theory. The Bayes estimators obtained from SEL and KLL
turned out to be the same. Under certain conditions, the Bayes estimator
derived from QEL led to an admissible minimax estimator (which was also equal
to the maximum likelihood estimator). The SEL also allowed finding admissible
minimax estimators. Some estimators had uniformly smaller variance than the MLE
and under suitable conditions the remaining estimators also satisfied this
property. In addition to their statistical properties, the estimators derived
here allow variation in allelic frequencies, which is closer to the reality of
finite populations exposed to evolutionary forces.

eXciting Dark Matter, or XDM) have been shown to be capable of generating the
3.55 keV line observed from galaxy clusters, while suppressing the flux of such
a line from smaller halos, including dwarf galaxies. In most of the XDM models
discussed in the literature, this up-scattering is mediated by a new light
particle, and dark matter annihilations proceed into pairs of this same light
state. In these models, the dark matter and mediator effectively reside within
a hidden sector, without sizable couplings to the Standard Model. In this
paper, we explore a model of XDM that does not include a hidden sector.
Instead, the dark matter both up-scatters and annihilates through the near

couplings to the dark matter and smaller, but non-neglibile, couplings to

knowledge of the pulsars pulse profile and how this template is generated. We
examine pulsar template generation with Bayesian methods. We will contrast the
classical generation mechanism of averaging intensity profiles with a new
approach based on Bayesian inference. We introduce the Bayesian measurement
model imposed and derive the algorithm to reconstruct a ""statistical template""
out of noisy data. The properties of these ""statistical templates"" are analysed
with simulated and real measurement data from PSR B1133+16. We explain how to
put this new form of template to use in analysing secondary parameters of
interest and give various examples: We implement a nonlinear filter for
determining ToAs of pulsars. Applying this method to data from PSR J1713+0747
we derive ToAs self consistently, meaning all epochs were timed and we used the
same epochs for template generation. While the average template contains
fluctuations and noise as unavoidable artifacts, we find that the ""statistical
template"" derived by Bayesian inference quantifies fluctuations and remaining
uncertainty. This is why the algorithm suggested turns out to reconstruct
templates of statistical significance from ten to fifty single pulses. A moving
data window of fifty pulses, taking out one single pulse at the beginning and
adding one at the end of the window unravels the characteristics of the methods
to be compared. It shows that the change induced in the classical
reconstruction is dominated by random fluctuations for the average template,
while statistically significant changes drive the dynamics of the proposed
method's reconstruction. The analysis of phase shifts with simulated data
reveals that the proposed nonlinear algorithm is able to reconstruct correct
phase information along with an acceptable estimation of the remaining
uncertainty.

hot gas cooling on scales of several kpc. This process generates the persistent
presence of a cold ISM phase, with mass ranging between 10$^4$ and $\gtrsim$ 5
$\times$ 10$^7$ M$_\odot$, where the latter value is appropriate for group
centered, massive galaxies. Widespread cooling occurs where the ratio of
cooling to free-fall time before the activation of the AGN feedback satisfies
$t_{cool}/t_{ff} \lesssim 70$, that is we find a less restrictive threshold
than commonly quoted in the literature. This process helps explaining the body
of observations of cold gas (both ionized and neutral/molecular) in Ellipticals
and, perhaps, the residual star formation detected in many early-type galaxies.
The amount and distribution of the off-center cold gas vary irregularly with
time. The cold ISM velocity field is irregular, initially sharing the
(outflowing) turbulent hot gas motion. Typical velocity dispersions of the cold
gas lie in the range 100-200 km/s. Freshly generated cold gas often forms a
cold outflow and can appear kinematically misaligned with respect to the stars.
We also follow the dust evolution in the hot and cold gas. We find that the
internally generated cold ISM has a very low dust content, with representative
values of the dust-to-gas ratio of 10$^{-4}$- 10$^{-5}$. Therefore, this cold
gas can escape detection in the traditional dust-absorption maps.

One of them is the role played by AGN phenomena in contributing to galaxy
build-up and to Star Formation (SF) quenching. On the other hand, the theory of
AGN formation predicts these phenomena to be correlated with the host-galaxy
environment, thus opening for links between SF quenching, environment and AGN
phenomena in the galaxy formation paradigm. This work is focused on the study
of the correlation between environmental density and radio AGN presence. Using
data from the photometric COSMOS survey and the radio 1.4GHz VLA-COSMOS, a
sample of radio AGNs has been defined. The environment has been studied
throughout the use of the richness distributions inside a parallelepipedon with
base side of 1 Mpc and height proportional to the photometric redshift
precision. Richness distributions have been compared as a function of both the
redshift and the relative evolution of the stellar masses of galaxies and AGN
hosts up to $z=2$. Radio AGNs are always located in environments that are
significantly denser than those around galaxies in which radio emission is
absent. Therefore, the environment seems to enhance the probability of a galaxy
to host a radio AGN. Moreover, a distinction between high power and low power
radio AGNs leads to the conclusion that the significance in the environmental
effect is maintained only for low power radio sources. By studying the
evolution of stellar masses it is possible to conclude that radio AGN presence
is a phenomenon related to quiescent galaxies up to $z=2$, with a significant
increase of the fraction of quiescent galaxies hosting a radio AGN with
decreasing redshift. Hints of an environmental effect are present. The results
found with this work lead to conclude that denser environments play a
significant role in enhancing the probability of a galaxy to host a low power
radio AGN.

below about 100 MeV in order to lower densities in faint galaxies. If the

that there is weak evidence for several large-scale anomalies in the CMB data.
While the evidence for each anomaly appears to be weak, the fact that there are
multiple seemingly unrelated anomalies makes it difficult to account for them
via a single statistical fluke. So, one is led to considering a combination of
these anomalies. But, if we ""hand-pick"" the anomalies (test statistics) to
consider, we are making an \textit{a posteriori} choice. In this article, we
propose two statistics that do not suffer from this problem. The statistics are
linear and quadratic combinations of the $a_{\ell m}$'s with random
co-efficients, and they test the null hypothesis that the $a_{\ell m}$'s are
independent, normally-distributed, zero-mean random variables with an
$m$-independent variance. The motivation for such statistics is generality;
equivalently, it is a non \textit{a posteriori} choice. But, a very useful
by-product of considering such statistics is this: Because most physical models
that lead to large-scale anomalies result in coupling multiple $\ell$ and $m$
modes, the ""coherence"" of this coupling should get enhanced if a combination of
different modes is considered. Using fiducial data, we demonstrate that the
method works and discuss how it can be used with actual CMB data to make quite
general statements about how incompatible the data are with the null
hypothesis.

populating d bands with a 99% fidelity was demonstrated, we present a

the Gutzwiller ansatz for the three d band orbitals we map the boundaries of
the Mott insulating phases. For not too large occupation, two of the orbitals
are predominantly occupied, while the third, of a slightly higher energy,
remains almost unpopulated. In this regime, in the superfluid phase we find the
formation of a vortex lattice, where the vortices come in vortex/anti-vortex
pairs with two pairs locked to every site. Due to the orientation of the
vortices time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken. This state also breaks
a discrete Z2-symmetry. We further derive an effective spin-1/2 model that
describe the relevant physics of the lowest Mott-phase with unit filling. We

larger than the Hubble rate H correspond to operators with imaginary dimensions

the derivation of existing maximum likelihood procedures as special instances
of the proposed Bayesian method. Inference can be conducted with the
combination of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for maximum \textit{a
posteriori} estimation and the Gibbs sampling iterative procedure. We
additionally investigate several Bayesian criteria for selecting the optimal
mixture configuration and describe diagnostic tools for assessing the fitness
of ranking distributions conditionally and unconditionally on the number of
ranked items. The utility of the novel Bayesian parametric Plackett-Luce
mixture for characterizing sample heterogeneity is illustrated with several
applications to simulated and real preference ranked data. We compare our
method with the frequentist approach and a Bayesian nonparametric mixture model
both assuming the Plackett-Luce model as a mixture component. Our analysis on
real datasets reveals the importance of an accurate diagnostic check for an
appropriate in-depth understanding of the heterogenous nature of the partial
ranking data.

photocatalysis on TiO$_2$(110). Although H$_2$O on rutile TiO$_2$(110) has been
thoroughly studied both experimentally and theoretically, a quantitative value
for the energy of the highest H$_2$O occupied levels is still lacking. For
experiment, this is due to the H$_2$O levels being obscured by hybridization
with TiO$_2$(110) levels in the difference spectra obtained via ultraviolet
photoemission spectroscopy (UPS). For theory, this is due to inherent
difficulties in properly describing many-body effects at the
H$_2$O-TiO$_2$(110) interface. Using the projected density of states (DOS) from
state-of-the-art quasiparticle (QP) $G_0W_0$, we disentangle the adsorbate and
surface contributions to the complex UPS spectra of H$_2$O on TiO$_2$(110). We
perform this separation as a function of H$_2$O coverage and dissociation on
stoichiometric and reduced surfaces. Due to hybridization with the TiO$_2$(110)
surface, the H$_2$O 3a$_1$ and 1b$_1$ levels are broadened into several peaks
between 5 and 1 eV below the TiO$_2$(110) valence band maximum (VBM). These
peaks have both intermolecular and interfacial bonding and antibonding
character. We find the highest occupied levels of H$_2$O adsorbed intact and
dissociated on stoichiometric TiO$_2$(110) are 1.1 and 0.9 eV below the VBM. We
also find a similar energy of 1.1 eV for the highest occupied levels of H$_2$O
when adsorbed dissociatively on a bridging O vacancy of the reduced surface. In
both cases, these energies are significantly higher (by 0.6 to 2.6 eV) than
those estimated from UPS difference spectra, which are inconclusive in this
energy region. Finally, we apply self-consistent QP$GW$ (scQP$GW$1) to obtain
the ionization potential of the H$_2$O-TiO$_2$(110) interface.

on a coarse grid by constructing multiscale basis functions in each coarse

are interested in cases when there is no scale separation and the perforations
can have different sizes. In this regard, we mention some earlier pioneering

functions in each coarse block using snapshot space and local spectral
problems. We show that with a few basis functions in each coarse block, one can
accurately approximate the solution, where each coarse block can contain many
small inclusions. We apply our general concept to (1) Laplace equation in

interactions on a metric space, capable of producing arbitrary degree
distributions as well as a naturally high degree of clustering akin to
biological networks. As a specific example, we study the case of random-
walking agents, though most results hold for any linear stochastic dynamics.
Agents form bonds when they meet at designated locations we refer to as

determines key characteristics of the network such as the degree distribution.
For any arbitrary (monotonic) degree distribution, we are able to analytically

real-world phenomena. Realistic generative network models are important in this
context as they avoid privacy concerns of real data and simplify complex
network research regarding data sharing, reproducibility, and scalability
studies. \emph{Random hyperbolic graphs} are a well-analyzed family of
geometric graphs. Previous work provided empirical and theoretical evidence
that this generative graph model creates networks with non-vanishing clustering
and other realistic features. However, the investigated networks in previous
applied work were small, possibly due to the quadratic running time of a
previous generator.
  In this work we provide the first generation algorithm for these networks
with subquadratic running time. We prove a time complexity of $O((n^{3/2}+m)
\log n)$ with high probability for the generation process. This running time is
confirmed by experimental data with our implementation. The acceleration stems
primarily from the reduction of pairwise distance computations through a polar
quadtree, which we adapt to hyperbolic space for this purpose. In practice we
improve the running time of a previous implementation by at least two orders of
magnitude this way. Networks with billions of edges can now be generated in a
few minutes.
  Finally, we evaluate the largest networks of this model published so far. Our
empirical analysis shows that important features are retained over different

vessels. He minimized the power dissipation arising from the trade-off between
fluid circulation and blood maintenance. The law, based on a constant fluid
viscosity, states that in the optimal configuration the fluid flow rate inside
the vessel is proportional to the cube of the vessel radius, implying that wall
shear stress is not dependent on the vessel radius. Murray's law has been found
to be true in blood macrocirculation, but not in microcirculation. In 2005,
Alarc\'on et al took into account the non monotonous dependence of viscosity on
vessel radius - F{\aa}hr{\ae}us-Lindqvist effect - due to phase separation
effect of blood. They were able to predict correctly the behavior of wall shear
stresses in microcirculation. One last crucial step remains however: to account
for the dependence of blood viscosity on shear rates. In this work, we
investigate how viscosity dependence on shear rate affects Murray's law. We
extended Murray's optimal design to the whole range of Qu\'emada's fluids, that
models pseudo-plastic fluids such as blood. Our study shows that Murray's
original law is not restricted to Newtonian fluids, it is actually universal
for all Qu\'emada's fluid as long as there is no phase separation effect. When
phase separation effect occurs, then we derive an extended version of Murray's
law. Our analyses are very general and apply to most of fluids with shear
dependent rheology. Finally, we study how these extended laws affect the
optimal geometries of fractal trees to mimic an idealized arterial network.

information flow, and hence the causality in a quantitative sense, between time
series. To assess the importance of a resulting causality, it needs to be
normalized. The normalization is achieved through distinguishing three types of
fundamental mechanisms that govern the marginal entropy change of the flow
recipient. A normalized or relative flow measures its importance relative to
other mechanisms. In analyzing realistic series, both absolute and relative
information flows need to be taken into account, since the normalizers for a
pair of reverse flows belong to two different entropy balances; it is quite
normal that two identical flows may differ a lot in relative importance in
their respective balances. We have reproduced these results with several
autoregressive models. We have also shown applications to a climate change
problem and a financial analysis problem. For the former, reconfirmed is the
role of the Indian Ocean Dipole as an uncertainty source to the El Ni\~no

Consider the first derivative of entropy relations together, we get the first
law of thermodynamics for all horizons. We also obtain the Smarr relation of
horizons by using the scaling discussion. For thermodynamics of all horizons,
the cosmological constant is treated as a thermodynamical variable. Especially
for thermodynamics of negative horizon, it is defined well in the $r<0$ side of
spacetime. The validity of this formula seems to work well for three-horizons
black holes. We also generalize the discussion to thermodynamics for event
horizon and Cauchy horizon of Gauss-Bonnet charged flat black holes, as the
Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant is also considered as thermodynamical variable.
These give further clue on the crucial role that the entropy relations of
multi-horizons play in black hole thermodynamics and understanding the entropy

presence of an ac drive, the dynamics of a single spin acquires additional

We study how the ensemble-averaged \delta s_{\omega}^2 evolves with the drive

additional peaks in the spectrum, caused by the drive, remain sharp even when
\omega_dr is much smaller than the typical hyperfine field. The reason is that
the drive affects only the spins for which the local Larmour frequency is close
to the drive frequency. The shape of the low-frequency ""Rabi""-peak in \delta
s_{\omega}^2 is universal with both, the position and the width, being of the

black hole X-ray binaries implies the strong coupling of the accretion and jet.
The correlation of $L_{\rm R} \propto L_{\rm X}^{\sim 0.5-0.7}$ was well
explained by the coupling of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow and a
jet. Recently, however, a growing number of sources show more complicated
radio/X-ray correlations, e.g., $L_{\rm R} \propto L_{\rm X}^{\sim 1.4}$ for
$L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$, which is suggested to be explained by
the coupling of a radiatively efficient accretion flow and a jet. In this work,
we interpret the deviation from the initial radio/X-ray correlation for $L_{\rm
X}/L_{\rm Edd} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ with a detailed disc corona-jet model. In this
model, the disc and corona are radiatively and dynamically coupled. Assuming a
fraction of the matter in the accretion flow, $\eta\equiv \dot M_{\rm jet}/\dot
M$, is ejected to form the jet, we can calculate the emergent spectrum of the
disc corona-jet system. We calculate $L_{\rm R}$ and $L_{\rm X}$ at different
$\dot M$, adjusting $\eta$ to fit the observed radio/X-ray correlation of the
black hole X-ray transient H1743-322 for $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}> 10^{-3}$. It
is found that always the X-ray emission is dominated by the disc corona and the
radio emission is dominated by the jet. We noted that the value of $\eta$ for
the deviated radio/X-ray correlation for $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd} > 10^{-3}$, is
systematically less than that of the case for $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd} <
10^{-3}$, which is consistent with the general idea that the jet is often
relatively suppressed at the high luminosity phase in black hole X-ray
binaries.

interference channels with feedback based on the ideas of time-varying coding
schemes. The proposed scheme improves the Suh-Tse and Kramer inner bounds of
the channel capacity for the cases of weak and not very strong interference.
This improvement is more significant when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is
not very high. It is shown theoretically and numerically that our coding scheme
can outperform the Kramer code. In addition, the generalized degrees-of-freedom
of our proposed coding scheme is equal to the Suh-Tse scheme in the strong
interference case. The numerical results show that our coding scheme can attain
better performance than the Suh-Tse coding scheme for all channel parameters.
Furthermore, the simplicity of the encoding/decoding algorithms is another
strong point of our proposed coding scheme compared with the Suh-Tse coding
scheme. More importantly, our results show that an optimal coding scheme for
the symmetric Gaussian interference channels with feedback can be achieved by
using only marginal posterior distributions under a better cooperation strategy

(2011)]. This theory is based on an exact equation for a Markov chain in phase
space and is not limited to small density. Previously, the hydrodynamic
equations were derived from this theory and its transport coefficients were
given in terms of infinite series. Here, I show that the transport coefficients
take a simple form in the large density limit. This allows me to analytically
evaluate the well-known density instability of the polarly ordered phase near
the flocking threshold at moderate and large densities. The growth rate of a
longitudinal perturbation is calculated and several scaling regimes, including
three different power laws, are identified. It is shown that at large
densities, the restabilization of the ordered phase at smaller noise is
analytically accessible within the range of validity of the hydrodynamic
theory. Analytical predictions for the width of the unstable band, the maximum
growth rate and for the wave number below which the instability occurs are
given. In particular, the system size below which spatial perturbations of the
homogeneous ordered state are stable is predicted to scale with $\sqrt{M}$
where $M$ is the average number of collision partners. The typical time scale
until the instability becomes visible is calculated and is proportional to M.

how the Bayesian analysis and a direct least-squares optimization, combined
with high-performance computing, can be used to assess the information content

enhancements within the central kpc and moderately suppressed activity at large

is stronger in the less massive galaxy than in the primary, and is also more
pronounced in mergers of more closely aligned disc spin orientations.

lineages radiate rapidly, resulting in a diversity of gene trees from a single
underlying species tree. Although such methods are gaining in popularity, they
are being adopted with caution in some quarters, in part because of an
increasing number of examples of strong phylogenetic conflict between
concatenation or supermatrix methods and species tree methods. Here we review
theory and empirical examples that help clarify these conflicts. Thinking of
concatenation as a special case of the more general model provided by the
multispecies coalescent can help explain a number of differences in the
behavior of the two methods on phylogenomic data sets. Recent work suggests
that species tree methods are more robust than concatenation approaches to some
of the classic challenges of phylogenetic analysis, including rapidly evolving
sites in DNA sequences, base compositional heterogeneity and long branch
attraction. We show that approaches such as binning, designed to augment the
signal in species tree analyses, can distort the distribution of gene trees and
are inconsistent. Computationally efficient species tree methods that
incorporate biological realism are a key to phylogenetic analysis of whole
genome data.

Coulomb energy than a sphere of the same area. For the volume-constrained case,
we find that a sphere has the highest Coulomb energy among all spheroidal

uniformly-charged shell due to small, area-conserving perturbations on the

possibility of counterion condensation on the spheroidal shell surface. We
employ a Manning-Oosawa two-state model approximation to evaluate the
renormalized charge and analyze the behavior of the equilibrium free energy as
a function of the shell's aspect ratio for both area-constrained and
volume-constrained cases. Counterion condensation is seen to favor the

the analysis of single datasets often generates unsatisfactory results. The
integrative analysis of multiple independent datasets provides an effective way
of pooling information and outperforms single-dataset analysis and some
alternative multi-datasets approaches including meta-analysis. Under certain
scenarios, multiple datasets are expected to share common important covariates,
that is, the multiple models have similarity in sparsity structures. However,
the existing methods do not have a mechanism to {\it promote} the similarity of
sparsity structures in integrative analysis. In this study, we consider
penalized variable selection and estimation in integrative analysis. We develop
an $L_0$-penalty based approach, which is the first to explicitly promote the
similarity of sparsity structures. Computationally it is realized using a
coordinate descent algorithm. Theoretically it has the much desired consistency
properties. In simulation, it significantly outperforms the competing
alternative when the models in multiple datasets share common important
covariates. It has better or similar performance as the alternative when the
sparsity structures share no similarity. Thus it provides a ""safe"" choice for
data analysis. Applying the proposed method to three lung cancer datasets with
gene expression measurements leads to models with significantly more similar
sparsity structures and better prediction performance.

spectrum utilization. Capacity analysis is very useful in investigating the
ultimate performance limits for wireless networks. Meanwhile, with increasing
potential future applications for the CR systems, it is necessary to explore
the limitations on their capacity in a dynamic spectrum access environment.
However, due to spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the
capacity of the secondary network (SRN) is much more difficult to analyze than
that of traditional wireless networks. To overcome this difficulty, in this
paper we introduce a novel solution based on small world model to analyze the
capacity of SRN. First, we propose a new method of shortcut creation for CRNs,
which is based on connectivity ratio. Also, a new channel assignment algorithm
is proposed, which jointly considers the available time and transmission time
of the channels. And then, we derive the capacity of SRN based on the small
world model over multi-radio multi-channel (MRMC) environment. The simulation
results show that our proposed scheme can obtain a higher capacity and smaller
latency compared with traditional schemes in MRMC CRNs.

mergers, either major or minor, or through clumpy disks in the early universe,
where clumps are driven to the center by dynamical friction. Also
pseudo-bulges, with a more disky morphology and kinematics, can form more
slowly through secular evolution of a bar, where resonant stars are elevated
out of the plane, in a peanut/box shape. As a result, in CDM cosmological
simulations, it is very difficult to find a bulgeless galaxy, while they are
observed very frequently in the local universe. A different picture emerges in
alternative models of the missing mass problem. In MOND (MOdified Newtonian
Dynamics), galaxy mergers are much less frequent, since the absence of dark
matter halos reduces the dynamical friction between two galaxies. Also, while
clumpy galaxies lead to rapid classical bulge formation in CDM, the inefficient
dynamical friction with MOND in the early-universe galaxies prevents the clumps
to coalesce together in the center to form spheroids. This leads to less
frequent and less massive classical bulges. Bars in MOND are more frequent and
stronger, and have a more constant pattern speed, which modifies significantly
the pseudo-bulge morphology. The fraction of pseudo-bulges is expected to be
dominant in MOND.

and receive result updates as data arrive and expire. We focus on applications
with real-time constraints, in which the user must receive each result update
within a given period after the update occurs. To handle fast data, the DSMS is
commonly placed on top of a cloud infrastructure. Because stream properties
such as arrival rates can fluctuate unpredictably, cloud resources must be
dynamically provisioned and scheduled accordingly to ensure real-time response.
It is quite essential, for the existing systems or future developments, to
possess the ability of scheduling resources dynamically according to the
current workload, in order to avoid wasting resources, or failing in delivering
correct results on time. Motivated by this, we propose DRS, a novel dynamic
resource scheduler for cloud-based DSMSs. DRS overcomes three fundamental
challenges: (a) how to model the relationship between the provisioned resources
and query response time (b) where to best place resources; and (c) how to
measure system load with minimal overhead. In particular, DRS includes an
accurate performance model based on the theory of \emph{Jackson open queueing
networks} and is capable of handling \emph{arbitrary} operator topologies,
possibly with loops, splits and joins. Extensive experiments with real data
confirm that DRS achieves real-time response with close to optimal resource
consumption.

structures of various amorphous solids. The method is based on the persistence
diagram (PD), a mathematical tool for capturing shapes of multiscale data. The
input to the PDs is given by an atomic configuration and the output is
expressed as 2D histograms. Then, specific distributions such as curves and
islands in the PDs identify meaningful shape characteristics of the atomic
configuration. Although the method can be applied to a wide variety of
disordered systems, it is applied here to silica glass, the Lennard-Jones
system, and Cu-Zr metallic glass as standard examples of continuous random
network and random packing structures. In silica glass, the method classified
the atomic rings as short-range and medium-range orders and unveiled
hierarchical ring structures among them. These detailed geometric
characterizations clarified a real space origin of the first sharp diffraction
peak and also indicated that PDs contain information on elastic response. Even
in the Lennard-Jones system and Cu-Zr metallic glass, the hierarchical
structures in the atomic configurations were derived in a similar way using
PDs, although the glass structures and properties substantially differ from
silica glass. These results suggest that the PDs provide a unified method that
extracts greater depth of geometric information in amorphous solids than
conventional methods.

measures which are mutually absolutely continuous, and the total variation
distance between $P_1$ and $P_2$ is not below a given value. It is further
shown that all the points of this convex region are attained by probability
measures which are defined on a binary alphabet. This characterization yields a
geometric interpretation of the minimal Chernoff information subject to a

exponential upper bound on the performance of binary linear block codes (or

Gallager bounding technique, and it reproduces the Shulman-Feder bound as a
special case. The bound is expressed in terms of the Renyi divergence from the
normalized distance spectrum of the code (or the average distance spectrum of
the ensemble) to the binomially distributed distance spectrum of the
capacity-achieving ensemble of random block codes. This exponential bound
provides a quantitative measure of the degradation in performance of binary

utilizing the massively parallel processing capabilities of the underlying

nodes can be dynamically added to or removed from an application to match the
latter's workload, which may fluctuate in an unpredictable manner. For an
application involving stateful operations such as aggregates, the addition /
removal of nodes necessitates the migration of operator states. Although the
importance of migration has been recognized in existing systems, two key
problems remain largely neglected, namely how to migrate and what to migrate,
i.e., the migration mechanism that reduces synchronization overhead and result
delay during migration, and the selection of the optimal task assignment that
minimizes migration costs. Consequently, migration in current systems typically
incurs a high spike in result delay caused by expensive synchronization
barriers and suboptimal task assignments. Motivated by this, we present the
first comprehensive study on efficient operator states migration, and propose
designs and algorithms that enable live, progressive, and optimized migrations.
Extensive experiments using real data justify our performance claims.

pinch is proposed to act as a plasma target in various applications including a
plasma stripper cell. One key parameter for such applications is the free
electron density. A linear dependency of this density to the amount of energy
transferred into the plasma from an energy storage was found by C. Teske. Since
the amount of stored energy is known, the energy transfer efficiency is a
reliable parameter for the design of a spherical theta pinch device. The
traditional two models of energy transfer efficiency are based on assumptions
which comprise the risk of systematical errors. To obtain precise results, this
paper proposes a new model without the necessity of any assumption to calculate
the energy transfer efficiency for an inductively coupled plasma device.
Further, a comparison of these three different models is given at a fixed
operation voltage for the full range of working gas pressures. Due to the
inappropriate assumptions included in the traditional models, one owns a
tendency to overestimate the energy transfer efficiency whereas the other leads
to an underestimation. Applying our new model to a wide spread set of operation
voltages and gas pressures, an overall picture of the energy transfer
efficiency results.

cent. Furthermore, this probability rapidly approaches zero at increasing
orbital period. Therefore transit surveys have been predominantly limited to
the inner parts of exoplanetary systems. Here we demonstrate how circumbinary
planets allow us to beat these unfavourable odds. By incorporating the geometry
and the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the
probability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet
orbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit
probability, but at an unspecified point in time. This probability, at its
minimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an
increasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical
development to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable,
and in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1
AU around a 0.3 AU eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit - a 100%
probability - if its mutual inclination is greater than 0.6 deg. We show that
the transit probability is generally only a weak function of the planet's
orbital period; circumbinary planets may be used as practical tools for probing
the outer regions of exoplanetary systems to search for and detect warm to cold
transiting planets.

Using a multitype branching process, we calculate the fixation probability of a

nonmutator is more likely to fix when the deleterious mutation rate of the
mutator population is high. Compensatory mutations in the mutator population
are found to decrease the fixation probability of a nonmutator when the
selection coefficient is large. But, surprisingly, the fixation probability
changes nonmonotonically with increasing compensatory mutation rate when the
selection is mild. Using these results for the fixation probability and a

duration of star formation. The derived total SFR (4+-1 10^-3 M_sun/yr) is
consistent with SFR estimated from the Ha emission integrated over the Ha
nebula. On small scales the Sigma_SFR derived using Ha systematically
underestimates the count-based Sigma_SFR, by up to a factor of 10. This is due
to ionizing photons escaping the area, where the stars are counted. We find

The NGC346 average SFR over a larger area (90 pc radius) lies closer to the
relation but remains high by a factor of ~3. The fraction of the total mass

the outer parts are dominated by a dispersed population. Therefore, the

We find that: (1) FeK{\alpha} is centred at a mean value of 6.42 keV.
Considering the instrumental and fits uncertainties, this value is compatible
with ionization states lower than FeXVIII. (2) The flux of the continuum is
well correlated with the flux of the line, as expected. Eclipse observations
show that the Fe fluorescence emission comes from an extended region
surrounding the X-ray source. (3) FeK{\alpha} is narrow (width lower than
0.15keV), reflecting that the reprocessing material does not move at high
speeds. We attempt to explain the broadness of the line in terms of three
possible broadening phenomena: line blending, Compton scattering and Doppler
shifts (with velocities of the reprocessing material V=1000-2000 km/s). (4) The

displaying clear similarities to numerical simulations. It highlights the
strong link between the absorbing and the fluorescent matter. The obtained
results clearly point to a very important contribution of the donors wind in

homological properties of the zero set of a continuous map $f:K\to R^n$ on a
compact space K that are invariant with respect to perturbations of f. The
perturbations are arbitrary continuous maps within $L_\infty$ distance r from f
for a given r>0. The main drawback of the approach is that the computability of
well groups was shown only when dim K=n or n=1.
  Our contribution to the theory of well groups is twofold: on the one hand we
improve on the computability issue, but on the other hand we present a range of
examples where the well groups are incomplete invariants, that is, fail to
capture certain important robust properties of the zero set.
  For the first part, we identify a computable subgroup of the well group that
is obtained by cap product with the pullback of the orientation of R^n by f. In
other words, well groups can be algorithmically approximated from below. When f
is smooth and dim K<2n-2, our approximation of the (dim K-n)th well group is
exact.
  For the second part, we find examples of maps $f,f': K\to R^n$ with all well
groups isomorphic but whose perturbations have different zero sets. We discuss
on a possible replacement of the well groups of vector valued maps by an
invariant of a better descriptive power and computability status.

involves the full wave function of the projectile ground state. Calculations
have been carried out for the total one-neutron removal cross section
$(\sigma_{-1n})$, the neutron-core relative energy spectrum, the parallel
momentum distribution of the core fragment, the valence neutron angular, and
energy-angular distributions. The calculated $\sigma_{-1n}$ has been compared
with the recently measured data to put constraints on the spin parity, and the
one-neutron separation energy ($S_n$) of the $^{37}$Mg ground state
($^{37}$Mg$_{gs}$). The dependence of $\sigma_{-1n}$ on the deformation of this
state has also been investigated. While a spin parity assignment of $7/2^-$ for
the $^{37}$Mg$_{gs}$ is ruled out by our study, neither of the $3/2^-$ and
$1/2^+$ assignments can be clearly excluded. Using the spectroscopic factor of
one for both the $3/2^-$ and $1/2^+$ configurations and ignoring the projectile
deformation effects, the $S_n$ values of $0.35 \pm 0.06$ MeV and $0.50 \pm

extracted $S_n$ is strongly dependent on the spectroscopic factor and the

the valence neutron angular distribution suggest a one-neutron halo

Several approaches exist to summarize the distribution of such sets based on
random closed set theory. While the recently proposed Vorob'ev approach
exploits analytical formulae, further notions of variability require Monte
Carlo estimators relying on Gaussian random field conditional simulations. In
the present work we propose a method to choose Monte Carlo simulation points

affine predictors. The points are chosen optimally in the sense that they
minimize the posterior expected distance in measure between the excursion set

to Monte Carlo simulations and enables the computation of quasi-realizations on
fine designs in large dimensions. We apply this reconstruction approach to
obtain realizations of an excursion set on a fine grid which allow us to give a

  dimension",,,"10.1016/j.jcp.2015.04.034",,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We implement a high-order numerical scheme for the entropy-based moment
closure, the so-called M$_N$ model, for linear kinetic equations in slab
geometry. A discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme in space along with a
strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta time integrator is a natural choice to
achieve a third-order scheme, but so far, the challenge for such a scheme in
this context is the implementation of a linear scaling limiter when the
numerical solution leaves the set of realizable moments (that is, those moments
associated with a positive underlying distribution). The difficulty for such a
limiter lies in the computation of the intersection of a ray with the set of
realizable moments. We avoid this computation by using quadrature to generate a
convex polytope which approximates this set. The half-space representation of
this polytope is used to compute an approximation of the required intersection
straightforwardly, and with this limiter in hand, the rest of the DG scheme is
constructed using standard techniques. We consider the resulting numerical
scheme on a new manufactured solution and standard benchmark problems for both
traditional M$_N$ models and the so-called mixed-moment models. The
manufactured solution allows us to observe the expected convergence rates and
explore the effects of the regularization in the optimization.

coherent squeezed states is examined. A two-dimensional noncommutative quantum
system supported by a deformed mathematical structure similar to that of
Hadamard billiards is obtained and their components behavior are monitored in
time. It is assumed that the independent degrees of freedom are two \emph{free}
1D harmonic oscillators (HO's), so the system Hamiltonian does not contain
interaction terms. Through the noncommutative deformation parameterized by a
Seiberg-Witten transform on the original canonical variables, one gets the
standard commutation relations for the new ones, such that the obtained
Hamiltonian represents then two \emph{interacting} 1D HO's. By assuming that
one HO is inverted relatively to the other, we show that their effective
interaction induces a squeezing dynamics for initial coherent states imaged in
the phase space. A suitable pattern of logarithmic spirals is obtained and some
relevant properties are discussed in terms of Wigner functions, which are
essential to put in evidence the effects of the noncommutativity.

interstellar species, they have been struggling to explain the observed
abundances of complex organic molecules. Current models tend to privilege grain
surface over gas phase chemistry in their formation. One key assumption of
those models is that radicals trapped in the grain mantles gain mobility and
react on lukewarm (>30 K) dust grains. Thus, the recent detections of methyl
formate (MF) and dimethyl ether (DME) in cold objects represent a challenge and
may clarify the respective role of grain surface and gas phase chemistry. We
propose here a new model to form DME and MF with gas phase reactions in cold
environments, where DME is the precursor of MF via an efficient reaction
overlooked by previous models. Furthermore, methoxy, a precursor of DME, is
also synthetized in the gas phase from methanol, which is desorbed by a
non-thermal process from the ices. Our new model reproduces fairy well the
observations towards L1544. It also explains, in a natural way, the observed
correlation between DME and MF. We conclude that gas phase reactions are major
actors in the formation of MF, DME and methoxy in cold gas. This challenges the
exclusive role of grain-surface chemistry and favours a combined grain-gas
chemistry.

relying on energy balance, to study the influence of an AGN in estimating both
the SFR and stellar mass in galaxies, as well as the contribution of the AGN to
the power output of the host. Using the galaxy formation SAM GALFORM, we create
mock galaxy SEDs using realistic star formation histories (SFH) and add an AGN
of Type 1, Type 2, or intermediate type whose contribution to the bolometric
luminosity can be variable. We perform an SED fitting of these catalogues with
CIGALE assuming three different SFHs: a single- and
double-exponentially-decreasing, and a delayed SFH. Constraining
thecontribution of an AGN to the LIR (fracAGN) is very challenging for
fracAGN<20%, with uncertainties of ~5-30% for higher fractions depending on the
AGN type, while FIR and sub-mm are essential. The AGN power has an impact on
the estimation of $M_*$ in Type 1 and intermediate type AGNs but has no effect
for galaxies hosting Type 2 AGNs. We find that in the absence of AGN emission,
the best estimates of $M_*$ are obtained using the
double-exponentially-decreasing model but at the expense of realistic ages of
the stellar population. The delayed SFH model provides good estimates of $M_*$
and SFR, with a maximum offset of 10% as well as better estimates of the age.
Our analysis shows that the underestimation of the SFR increases with fracAGN
for Type 1 systems, as well as for low contributions of an intermediate AGN
type, but it is quite insensitive to the emission of Type 2 AGNs up to
fracAGN~45%. Similarly the UV emission is critical in accurately retrieving the
$M_*$ for Type 1 and intermediate type AGN, and the SFR of all of the three AGN
types. We show that the presence of AGN emission introduces a scatter to the
SFR-$M_*$ main sequence relation derived from SED fitting, which is driven by
the uncertainties on $M_*$.

towards protostellar outflows in the L1448, NGC1333-IRAS4, HH46, BHR71 and
VLA1623 star forming regions. We detect emission spatially resolved along the
outflow direction, which can be associated with a low excitation atomic jet. In
the L1448-C, HH46 IRS and BHR71 IRS1 outflows this emission is kinematically
resolved into blue- and red-shifted jet lobes, having radial velocities up to
200 km/s. In the L1448-C atomic jet the velocity increases with the distance
from the protostar, similarly to what observed in the SiO jet associated with
this source. This suggests that [OI] and molecular gas are kinematically
connected and that this latter could represent the colder cocoon of a jet at
higher excitation. Mass flux rates (\.M$_{jet}$(OI)) have been measured from
the [OI]63micron luminosity adopting two independent methods. We find values in
the range 1-4 10$^{-7}$ Mo/yr for all sources but HH46, for which an order of
magnitude higher value is estimated. \.M$_{jet}$(OI) are compared with mass
accretion rates (\.M$_{acc}$) onto the protostar and with \.M$_{jet}$ derived
from ground-based CO observations. \.M$_{jet}$(OI)/\.M$_{acc}$ ratios are in
the range 0.05-0.5, similar to the values for more evolved sources.
\.M$_{jet}$(OI) in HH46 IRS and IRAS4A are comparable to \.M$_{jet}$(CO), while
those of the remaining sources are significantly lower than the corresponding
\.M$_{jet}$(CO). We speculate that for these three sources most of the mass
flux is carried out by a molecular jet, while the warm atomic gas does not
significantly contribute to the dynamics of the system.

the prewavelet masks. Finally, we give a procedure to construct the associated
nonstationary biorthogonal bases and filters to be used in efficient
decomposition and reconstruction algorithms. As an example, we calculate the
prewavelet masks and the nonstationary biorthogonal filter pairs corresponding
to the $C^2$ nonstationary scaling functions in the class and construct the
corresponding prewavelets and biorthogonal bases. A simple test showing their
good performances in the analysis of a spike-like signal is also presented.

  For genus 0 invariants of non-exceptional Fano complete intersections other
than the cubic hypersurfaces, we find a square root recursion phenomenon. Based
on this we develop an algorithm to compute the genus 0 invariants of any

  We prove the conjecture at the first non-trivial order, which amounts to
computation of genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants with exactly 4 primitive

geometric approach. In particular, we obtain a reconstruction theorem for (i)
genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of cubic hypersurfaces and odd dimensional
complete intersection of two quadrics and (ii) genus zero Gromov-Witten
invariants with at most 4 primitive insertions for all non-exceptional Fano

  partly published in references [1-3]",,,,"cs.IT math.IT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the problem of coordinating several agents through
their actions. Although the methodology applies to general scenarios, the
present work focuses on a situation with an asymmetric observation structure
that only involves two agents. More precisely, one of the agents knows the
past, present, and future realizations of a state (the system state) that
affects the common payoff function of the agents; in contrast, the second agent
is assumed either to know the past realizations of the system state or to have
no knowledge of it. In both cases, the second agent has access to some strictly
causal observations of the first agent's actions, which enables the two agents
to coordinate. These scenarios are applied to the problem of distributed power
control; the key idea is that a transmitter may embed information about the
wireless channel state into its transmit power levels so that an observation of
these levels, e.g. the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio, allows the
other transmitter to coordinate its power levels. The main contributions of
this paper are twofold. First, we provide a characterization of the set of
feasible average payoffs when the agents repeatedly take long sequences of
actions and the realizations of the system state are \acs{iid}. Second, we
exploit these results in the context of distributed power control and introduce
the concept of coded power control. We carry out an extensive numerical
analysis of the benefits of coded power control over alternative power control
policies, and highlight a simple yet non-trivial example of a power control
code.

sequence and substellar companions. The other peak around 0.4 M$_\odot$
corresponds to the white dwarf companions. The derived masses for the white
dwarf companions are significantly lower than the average mass for single

Majorana masses for the light neutrinos radiatively but also makes the lighter
of the neutral $Z_2$-odd scalars an eligible dark matter candidate, in addition
to triggering leptogenesis at the scale of the heavy neutrino masses. Taking
two representative values of this mass scale, we identify the allowed regions
of the parameter space of the model, which are consistent with all dark matter
constraints. At the same time, the running of quartic couplings in the scalar
potential to high scales is studied, thus subjecting the regions consistent
with dark matter constraints to further requirements of vacuum stability,
perturbativity and unitarity. It is found that part of the parameter space is
consistent with all of these requirements all the way up to the Planck scale,
and also yields the correct signal strength in the diphoton channel for the
scalar observed at the Large Hadron Collider.

recover a sparse vector $x_o \in \mathbb{R}^N$ from its undersampled set of
noisy observations $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $y=A x_o+w$. The last decade has
witnessed a surge of algorithms and theoretical results addressing this
question. One of the most popular algorithms is the $\ell_p$-regularized least
squares (LPLS) given by the following formulation: \[ \hat{x}(\gamma,p )\in
\arg\min_x \frac{1}{2}\|y - Ax\|_2^2+\gamma\|x\|_p^p, \] where $p \in [0,1]$.
Despite the non-convexity of these problems for $p<1$, they are still appealing
because of the following folklores in compressed sensing: (i) $\hat{x}(\gamma,p
)$ is closer to $x_o$ than $\hat{x}(\gamma,1)$. (ii) If we employ iterative
methods that aim to converge to a local minima of LPLS, then under good
initialization these algorithms converge to a solution that is closer to $x_o$
than $\hat{x}(\gamma,1)$. In spite of the existence of plenty of empirical
results that support these folklore theorems, the theoretical progress to
establish them has been very limited.
  This paper aims to study the above folklore theorems and establish their
scope of validity. Starting with approximate message passing algorithm as a
heuristic method for solving LPLS, we study the impact of initialization on the
performance of AMP. Then, we employ the replica analysis to show the connection
between the solution of AMP and $\hat{x}(\gamma, p)$ in the asymptotic
settings. This enables us to compare the accuracy of $\hat{x}(\gamma,p)$ for $p
\in [0,1]$. In particular, we will characterize the phase transition and noise
sensitivity of LPLS for every $0\leq p\leq 1$ accurately. Our results in the
noiseless setting confirm that LPLS exhibits the same phase transition for
every $0\leq p <1$ and this phase transition is much higher than that of LASSO.

and coherence length in all directions at the same temperature and magnetic
field. This is particularly useful for MgB$_2$, where these quantities vary
with the applied magnetic field and values are difficult to obtain at low field
or in the $c$-direction. We obtained images of flux vortices from an MgB$_2$
single crystal cut in the $ac$ plane by focussed ion beam milling and tilted to
$45^\circ$ with respect to the electron beam about its $a$ axis. A new method
was developed to simulate these images which accounted for vortices with a
non-zero core in a thin, anisotropic superconductor and a simplex algorithm was
used to make a quantitative comparison between the images and simulations to
measure the penetration depths and coherence lengths. This gave penetration
depths $\Lambda_{ab}=100\pm 35$ nm and $\Lambda_c=120\pm 15$ nm at 10.8 K in a
field of 4.8 mT. The large error in $\Lambda_{ab}$ is a consequence of tilting
the sample about $a$ and had it been tilted about $c$, the errors would be
reversed. Thus, obtaining the most precise values requires taking images of the
flux lattice with the sample tilted in more than one direction. In a previous
paper, we obtained a more precise value using a sample cut in the $ab$ plane.
Using this value gives $\Lambda_{ab}=107\pm 8$ nm, $\Lambda_c=120\pm 15$ nm,
$\xi_{ab}=39\pm 11$ nm and $\xi_c=35\pm 10$ nm which agree well with
measurements made using other techniques. The experiment required two days to
conduct and does not require large-scale facilities. It was performed on a very
small sample: $30\times 15$ microns and 200 nm thick so this method could prove
useful for characterising new superconductors where only small single crystals

Camargo 439 with Galactic coordinates $\ell=81.11^{\circ}$ and
$b=-77.84^{\circ}$ is an $\sim2$ Myr embedded cluster (EC) located at a
distance from the Sun of $d_{\odot}=5.09\pm0.47$ kpc. Adopting the distance of

Galactocentric distance of $R_{GC}=8.70\pm0.26$ kpc and a vertical distance
from the plane of $-4.97\pm0.46$ kpc. Camargo 438 at $\ell=79.66^{\circ}$ and
$b=-78.86^{\circ}$ presents similar values. The derived parameters for these
two ECs put HRK 81.4-77.8 in the halo at a distance from the Galactic centre of
$\sim8.7$ kpc and $\sim5.0$ kpc from the disc. Star clusters provide the only
direct means to determine the high latitude molecular cloud distances. The
present study shows that the molecular cloud HRK 81.4-77.8 is currently forming
stars, apparently an unprecedented event detected so far among high latitude
clouds. We carried out a preliminary orbit analysis. It shows that this ECs are
the most distant known embedded clusters from the plane and both cloud and
clusters are probably falling ballistically from the halo onto the Galactic
disc, or performing a flyby.

the center switches between both states at any power. A dedicated three-level
model implying a shelving level is developed to extract the relevant

very existence of the shelving level for the neutral NV center. It is found
that it plays a negligible role on the photophysics of this center, whereas it
is responsible for an increasing photon bunching behavior of the negative NV
center with increasing power. From the photophysical parameters, we infer a
quantum efficiency for both centers, showing that it remains close to unity for
the neutral center over the entire power range, whereas it drops with
increasing power from near unity to approximately 0.5 for the negative center.
The photophysics of the photochromic center reveals a rich phenomenology that

the excess charge release of the negative center being much slower than the

compare the values of pixel pairs; changes to either of the pixels can easily
lead to changes in descriptor values, hence damaging its performance. In order

superconducting thin film spiral resonators. The rf transmission spectrum of a
single element of the metamaterial shows a fundamental resonance peak at
$\sim$24.95 MHz that shifts to a 25$\%$ smaller frequency and becomes
degenerate when a 3D array of such elements is created. The metamaterial shows
an $\emph{in-situ}$ tunable narrow frequency band in which the real part of the
effective permeability is negative over a wide range of temperature, which
reverts to gradually near-zero and positive values as the superconducting
critical temperature is approached. This metamaterial can be used for
increasing power transfer efficiency and tunability of electrically small
rf-antennas.

reviewed and its applications are systematically discussed. The model is based
on a simple form of the quark potential, which contains a Coulomb-like
interaction and a confinement, both expressed in terms of a collective space
coordinate, the hyperradius. The model has only three free parameters,
determined in order to describe the baryon spectrum. Once the parameters have
been fixed, the model, in its non relativistic version, is used to predict
various quantities of physical interest, namely the elastic nucleon form
factors, the photocouplings and the helicity amplitudes for the electromagnetic
excitation of the baryon resonances. In particular, the $Q^2$ dependence of the
helicity amplitude is quite well reproduced, thanks to the Coulomb-like
interaction. The model is reformulated in a relativistic version by means of
the Point Form hamilton dynamics. While the inclusion of relativity does not
alter the results for the helicity amplitudes, a good description of the
nucleon elastic form factors is obtained.

Atlas3D survey. Using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to one
effective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strength
indices and applying single stellar population (SSP) models to derive
SSP-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; and
one based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formation
histories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-mass
formation timescales. Using homogeneously derived effective radii and
dynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellar
population parameters on the Mass Plane (M_JAM, Sigma_e, R_maj), showing that
at fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, more
metal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.
  From non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration of
star formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. Assuming
that our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's local
Universe, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 Gyr
following the big bang. Most of these stars reside today in the most massive
galaxies (>10^10.5 M_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.
The lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars in
this time interval. Stellar population properties are independent of
environment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only with
galaxy mass. In the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by the
Virgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorter
star-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

the extended modular group PGL(2,Z). This `modular' involution is discontinuous
at rationals but satisfies a surprising collection of functional equations. It
preserves the set of real quadratic irrationalities mapping them in a highly
non-obvious way to each other. It commutes with the Galois action on real
quadratic irrationals. More generally, it preserves set-wise the orbits of the
modular group, thereby inducing an involution of the moduli space of real
rank-two lattices. It induces a duality of Beatty partitions of the set of
positive integers. This involution conjugates (though not topologically) the
Gauss' continued fraction map to an intermittent dynamical system on the unit
interval with an infinite invariant measure. The transfer operator (resp. the
functional equation) naturally associated to this dynamical system is closely
related to the Mayer transfer operator (resp. the Lewis' functional equation).
We give a description of this involution as the boundary action of a certain
automorphism of the infinite trivalent tree. We prove that its derivative
exists and vanishes almost everywhere. It is conjectured that algebraic numbers
of degree at least three are mapped to transcendental numbers under this
involution.

a characteristic unique peak appears, which, after analyzing the ground state

associated with a more complex structure in the third harmonic. These new
characteristics observed in K atoms indicate the breakdown of the area theorem,
as was already demonstrated under similar circumstances in narrow band gap
semiconductors.

if and only if there is a non-scalar matrix $T$ such that $TW=WT^*$. Also, we
prove that reducibility can be studied by looking at the commutant of the monic
orthogonal polynomials or by looking at the coefficients of the corresponding
three term recursion relation. A matrix weight may not be expressible as direct
sum of irreducible weights, but it is always equivalent to a direct sum of
irreducible weights. We also establish that the decompositions of two
equivalent weights as sums of irreducible weights have the same number of terms
and that, up to a permutation, they are equivalent.
  We consider the algebra of right-hand-side matrix differential operators
$\mathcal D(W)$ of a reducible weight $W$, giving its general structure.
Finally, we make a change of emphasis by considering reducibility of
polynomials, instead of reducibility of matrix weights.
