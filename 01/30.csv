different administrative sources collected on several different partitions of a
geographic zone of interest into administrative units induces the so called
areal interpolation problem. This problem is that of allocating the data from a
set of source spatial units to a set of target spatial units. A particular case
of that problem is the re-allocation to a single target partition which is a
regular grid. At the European level for example, the EU directive 'INSPIRE', or
INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation, encourages the states to provide
socio-economic data on a common grid to facilitate economic studies across
states. In the literature, there are three main types of such techniques:
proportional weighting schemes, smoothing techniques and regression based
interpolation. We propose a stochastic model based on Poisson point patterns to
study the statistical accuracy of these techniques for regular grid targets in
the case of count data. The error depends on the nature of the target variable
and its correlation with the auxiliary variable. For simplicity, we restrict
attention to proportional weighting schemes and Poisson regression based
methods. Our conclusion is that there is no technique which always dominates.

ports of the interferometers can reduce the photon noise of the system beyond
the shot-noise, enhancing the resolution in the phase-correlation estimation.
We analyze both the use of two-mode squeezed vacuum or twin-beam state (TWB)
and of two independent squeezing states. Our results basically confirms the
benefit of using squeezed beams together with strong coherent beams in
interferometry, even in this correlated case. However, mainly we concentrate on
the possible use of TWB, discovering interesting and probably unexplored areas
of application of bipartite entanglement and in particular the possibility of
reaching in principle surprising uncertainty reduction.

independently of and are not influenced by measurements, is usually tested
using Leggett-Garg inequalities. Recently, another necessary condition called
no-signaling in time (NSIT) has been proposed as a witness for non-classical
behavior. In this paper, we show that a combination of NSIT conditions is not
only necessary but also sufficient for a macrorealistic description of a
physical system. Any violation of macroscopic realism must therefore be
witnessed by a suitable NSIT condition. Subsequently, we derive an operational
formulation for NSIT in terms of positive operator-valued measurements and the

applicable to obscured AGNs. This method estimates the black hole mass using
the width of the narrow core of the neutral FeKa emission line in X-rays and
the distance of its emitting region from the black hole based on the isotropic
luminosity indicator via the luminosity scaling relation. We collect the line
width data of the neutral FeKa line core for seven type-1 AGNs and seven type-2
AGNs obtained by the Chandra HETGS. Assuming the virial relation between the
locations and the velocity widths of the neutral FeKa line core and the broad
Hb emission line, the luminosity scaling relation of the neutral FeKa line core
emitting region is estimated. We find that the FWHM of the neutral FeKa line
core falls between that of the broad Balmer emission lines and the
corresponding value at the dust reverberation radius for most of the type-1
AGNs and for all of the type-2 AGNs. This suggests that significant fraction of
photons of the neutral FeKa line core originates between the outer BLR and the
inner dust torus in most cases. The black hole mass M_FeKa estimated with this
method is then compared with other black hole mass estimates, such as the broad
emission-line reverberation mass M_rev for the type-1 AGNs, the mass M_H2O
based on the H2O maser and the single-epoch mass estimate M_pol based on the
polarized broad Balmer lines for the type-2 AGNs. We find that M_FeKa is
consistent with M_rev for the most of the type-1 AGNs and with M_pol for all of
the type-2 AGNs. We also find that M_FeKa is correlated well with M_H2O for the
type-2 AGNs. These results suggest that M_FeKa is a potential indicator of the
black hole mass especially for obscured AGNs. In contrast, M_FeKa for which the
same virial factor as for M_rev and M_pol is adopted is systematically larger
than M_H2O by about a factor of about 5. (abridged)

interaction strength and impurity potential strength. We focus in particular on
the interaction-induced modifications in the local density of states around the
impurity, which is a quantity that can be directly probed by scanning tunneling
spectroscopy of doped graphene. We find that the resonant character of the
impurity states near the Fermi level is enhanced by the interactions.
Furthermore, the size of the energy gap, which opens at high-symmetry points of

invariant, an extrinsic scalar conformal invariant and the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet

Willmore energy is the unique global conformal invariant, up to the addition of
a topological term (the Gauss curvature, giving the Euler Characteristic by the
Gauss Bonnet Theorem). A similar statement holds also for codimension two
surfaces, once taking into account an additional topological term given by the

non-linearity. Serrin's celebrated symmetry theorem states that, if the normal
derivative $u_\nu$ is constant on $\Gamma$, then $\Omega$ must be a ball.
  In [CMS2], it has been conjectured that Serrin's theorem may be obtained by
stability in the following way: first, for a solution $u$ prove the estimate $$
r_e-r_i\le C_\delta\,[u]_{\Gamma^\delta} $$ for some constant $C_\delta$
depending on $\delta>0$, where $r_e$ and $r_i$ are the radii of a spherical
annulus containing $\Gamma$, $\Gamma^\delta$ is a surface parallel to $\Gamma$
at distance $\delta$ and sufficiently close to $\Gamma$, and
$[u]_{\Gamma^\delta}$ is the Lipschitz semi-norm of $u$ on $\Gamma^\delta$;
secondly, if in addition $u_\nu$ is constant on $\Gamma$, show that $$
[u]_{\Gamma^\delta}=o(C_\delta)\ \mbox{ as } \ \delta\to 0^+. $$ In this paper,
we prove that this strategy is successful.
  As a by-product of this method, for $C^{2,\tau}$-regular domains, we also
obtain a linear stability estimate for Serrin's symmetry result. Our result is
optimal and greatly improves the similar logarithmic-type estimate of [ABR] and
the H\""{o}lder estimate of [CMV] that was restricted to convex domains.

in this simplified scalar setting (one of Einstein's precursors to general

self-gravitating theory. Using an iterative technique, we compare the mass
dependence of the ground state energies of both Schrodinger-Newton and the new,
self-sourced system and find that they are dramatically different. The Bohr
method approach from old quantization provides a qualitative description of the
difference, which comes from the additional nonlinearity introduced in the

calculate the transition energy between the ground state and first excited

quasars have a significantly lower far-infrared luminosity than
bolometric-luminosity-matched samples at lower redshift, inferring a lower star
formation rate, possibly correlated with the lower black hole masses at z=6.
The ratios of [CII] to far-infrared luminosities in the CFHQS quasars are
comparable with those of starbursts of similar star formation rate in the local
universe. We determine values of velocity dispersion and dynamical mass for the
quasar host galaxies based on the [CII] data. We find that there is no
significant offset from the relations defined by nearby galaxies with similar
black hole masses. There is however a marked increase in the scatter at z=6,

combinatorics, for example in connection with the strong perfect graph theorem
and in certain graph algorithms. Previous dichotomy theorems required the graph
to be tree-like so that tree-like decompositions could be exploited in the

channel with receiver side information under the lens of individual secrecy
constraints. That is, the transmitter wants to send two independent messages to
two receivers which have, respectively, the desired message of the other
receiver as side information, while keeping the eavesdropper ignorant of each
message (i.e., the information leakage from each message to the eavesdropper is
made vanishing). Building upon one-time pad, secrecy coding, and broadcasting
schemes, achievable rate regions are investigated, and the capacity region for
special cases of either a weak or strong eavesdropper (compared to both
legitimate receivers) are characterized. Interestingly, the capacity region for
the former corresponds to a line and the latter corresponds to a square with
missing corners; a phenomenon occurring due to the coupling between user's
rates. Moreover, the individual secrecy capacity region is also fully
characterized for the case where the eavesdropper's channel is deterministic.
In addition to discrete memoryless setup, Gaussian scenarios are studied. For
the Gaussian model, in addition to the strong and weak eavesdropper cases, the
capacity region is characterized for the low and high SNR regimes when the
eavesdropper's channel is stronger than one receiver but weaker than the other.
Remarkably, positive secure transmission rates are always guaranteed under the
individual secrecy constraint, unlike the case of the joint secrecy constraint
(i.e., the information leakage from both messages to the eavesdropper is made
vanishing). Thus, this notion of secrecy serves as an appropriate candidate for
trading off secrecy level and transmission rate; making secrecy more affordable
but still acceptable to the end user.

magnetohydrodynamic) outflows that are propelled by their enormously strong
luminosities. The winds are often found to be structured and variable, but can
also display periodic or quasi-periodic behavior in a variety of wind
diagnostics. The regular variations observed in putatively single stars,
especially in UV wind lines, have often been attributed to corotating
interaction regions (CIRs) like those seen in the solar wind. We present light
curves for variable polarization from winds with CIR structures. We develop a
model for a time-independent CIR based on a kinematical description. Assuming
optically thin electron scattering, we explore the range of polarimetric light
curves that result as the curvature, latitude, and number of CIRs are varied.
We find that a diverse array of variable polarizations result from an
exploration of cases. The net polarization from an unresolved source is
weighted more toward the inner radii of the wind. Given that most massive stars
have relatively fast winds compared to their rotation speeds, CIRs tend to be
conical at inner radii, transitioning to a spiral shape at a few to several
stellar radii in the wind. Winds with a single CIR structure lead to easily
identifiable polarization signatures. By contrast allowing for multiple CIRs,
all emerging from a range of azimuth and latitude positions at the star, can
yield complex polarimetric behavior. Although our model is based on some
simplifying assumptions, it produces qualitative behavior that we expect to be
robust, and this has allowed us to explore a wide range of CIR configurations
that will prove useful for interpreting polarimetric data.

planetary-like masses at matter-radiation equality and producing abundances
comparable to those of Dark Matter today, while the matter power spectrum on
scales probed by CMB anisotropies agrees with Planck data. These PBH could have
acquired large stellar masses today, via merging, and the model passes both the
constraints from CMB distortions and micro-lensing. This scenario is supported
by Chandra observations of numerous BH candidates in the central region of
Andromeda. Moreover, the tail of the PBH mass distribution could be responsible
for the seeds of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies, as well as
for ultra-luminous X-rays sources. We find that our effective hybrid potential

to correct the errors in the angular positions already in the computation of a

using the laws of the two-body dynamics, we can write 8 equations in 8
unknowns. The unknowns are the components of the topocentric velocity
orthogonal to the line of sight at the two mean epochs of the tracks, and the
corrections $\Delta$ to be applied to the angular positions. We take advantage
of the fact that the components of $\Delta$ are typically small. We show the
results of some tests, performed with simulated observations, and compare this

vehicles (UAVs) that can be used to enhance their flight endurance by utilizing
{\sl insitu} measurements of wind speeds and wind gradients. In these
strategies, periodic adjustments are made in the airspeed and/or heading angle
command, in level flights, for the UAV to minimize a projected power
requirement. In this study, UAV dynamics are described by a three-dimensional
dynamic point-mass model. A stochastic wind field model has been used to
analyze the effect of the wind in the process. Onboard closed-loop trajectory
tracking logics that follow airspeed vector commands are modeled using the
method of feedback linearization. To evaluate the benefits of these strategies
in enhancing UAV flight endurance, a reference strategy is introduced in which
the UAV would follow the optimal airspeed command in a steady level flight
under zero wind conditions. A performance measure is defined as the average
power consumption with respect to no wind case. Different scenarios have been
evaluated both over a specified time interval and over different initial
heading angles of the UAV. A relative benefit criterion is then defined as the
percentage improvement in the performance measure of a proposed strategy over
that of the reference strategy. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted
to show efficiency and applicability of the proposed algorithms. Results
demonstrate possible power savings of the proposed real-time guidance
strategies in level flights, by utilization of wind energy.

decomposition for classification. When large-scale datasets are present,
typical approaches usually employed truncated kernel methods on the feature
space or DC approaches on the sample space. However, this did not guarantee
separability between classes, owing to overfitting. To overcome such problems,
this work proposes a novel DC approach on feature spaces consisting of three
steps. Firstly, we divide the feature space into several subspaces using the
decomposition method proposed in this paper. Subsequently, these feature
subspaces are sent into individual local classifiers for training. Finally, the
outcomes of local classifiers are fused together to generate the final
classification results. Experiments on large-scale datasets are carried out for
performance evaluation. The results show that the error rates of the proposed
DC method decreased comparing with the state-of-the-art fast SVM solvers, e.g.,
reducing error rates by 10.53% and 7.53% on RCV1 and covtype datasets
respectively.

necessary, for emission from an active galactic nucleus (AGN), through the
decomposition of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). About 10 per cent
of the sample are detected individually in \textit{Chandra} observations of the

properties. After subtracting the X-ray luminosity expected from star formation
and correcting for nuclear obscuration, we derive the average AGN accretion
rate for both detected sources and stacks, as a function of M$_{*}$, SFR and
redshift. The average accretion rate correlates with SFR and with M$_*$. The
dependence on SFR becomes progressively more significant at z$>$0.8. This may
suggest that SFR is the original driver of these correlations. We find that
average AGN accretion and star formation increase in a similar fashion with
offset from the star-forming ""main-sequence"". Our interpretation is that
accretion onto the central black hole and star formation broadly trace each

a result of tunnelling events when transitions occur between topologically
different but physically identical vacuum winding states. These new terms give
an extra contribution to the Casimir pressure, yet to be measured.
  We argue that if the same system is considered in the background of a small
external time-dependent magnetic field, than there will be emission of photons
from the vacuum, similar to the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) when real
particles are radiated from the vacuum due to the time-dependent boundary
conditions. The difference with conventional DCE is that the dynamics of the
vacuum in our system is not related to the fluctuations of the conventional
degrees of freedom, the virtual photons. Rather, the radiation in our case
occurs as a result of tunnelling events between topologically different but
physically identical $|k>$ sectors in a time -dependent background. We comment
on relation of this novel effect with the well-known, experimentally observed,
and theoretically understood phenomena of the persistent currents in normal

and abundances ('stellar labels') for hundreds of thousands of stars in the

there is a sub-set of reference objects for which the stellar labels are known
with high(er) fidelity. We take advantage of this with The Cannon, a new

The Cannon learns from the 'known' labels of reference stars how the
continuum-normalized spectra depend on these labels by fitting a flexible model
at each wavelength; then, The Cannon uses this model to derive labels for the
remaining survey stars. We illustrate The Cannon by training the model on only
542 stars in 19 clusters as reference objects, with Teff, log g and [Fe/H] as
the labels, and then applying it to the spectra of 56,000 stars from APOGEE
DR10. The Cannon is very accurate. Its stellar labels compare well to the stars
for which APOGEE pipeline (ASPCAP) labels are provided in DR10, with rms
differences that are basically identical to the stated ASPCAP uncertainties.
Beyond the reference labels, The Cannon makes no use of stellar models nor any
line-list, but needs a set of reference objects that span label-space. The
Cannon performs well at lower signal-to-noise, as it delivers comparably good
labels even at one ninth the APOGEE observing time. We discuss the limitations
of The Cannon and its future potential, particularly, to bring different
spectroscopic surveys onto a consistent scale of stellar labels.

pulsar can undergo superradiant scattering off a spinning black hole companion.
We find that the relative amount of superradiant modes in the radiation depends
on the pulsar's angular position relative to the black hole's equatorial plane.
In particular, when the pulsar and black hole spins are aligned, superradiant
modes are dominant at large angles, leading to an amplification of the pulsar's
luminosity, whereas for small angles the radiation is dominantly composed of
non-superradiant modes and the signal is attenuated. This results in a
characteristic orbital modulation of the pulsar's luminosity, up to the percent
level within our approximations, which may potentially yield a signature of
superradiant scattering in astrophysical black holes and hence an important
test of general relativity.

relatively strong Ca spectral lines at ~2 months after peak brightness. This
class also has an extended projected offset distribution, with several members
of the class offset from their host galaxies by 30 - 150 kpc. There is no
indication of any stellar population at the SN positions. Using a sample of 13
Ca-rich SNe, we present kinematic evidence that the progenitors of Ca-rich SNe
originate near the centers of their host galaxies and are kicked to the
locations of the SN explosions. Specifically, SNe with small projected offsets
have large line-of-sight velocity shifts as determined by nebular lines, while
those with large projected offsets have no significant velocity shifts.
Therefore, the velocity shifts must not be primarily the result of the SN
explosion. There is an excess of SNe with blueshifted velocity shifts within
two isophotal radii (5/6 SNe), indicating that the SNe are moving away from
their host galaxies and redshifted SNe on the far sides of their galaxies are
selectively missed in SN surveys. Additionally, nearly every Ca-rich SN is
hosted by a galaxy with indications of a recent merger and/or is in a dense
environment. We propose a progenitor model which fits all current data: The
progenitor system for a Ca-rich SN is a double white dwarf (WD) system where at
least one WD has a significant He abundance. This system, through an
interaction with a super-massive black hole (SMBH) is ejected from its host
galaxy and the binary is hardened, significantly reducing the merger time.
After 10 - 100 Myr (on average), the system explodes with a large physical
offset. The rate for such events is significantly enhanced for galaxies which
have undergone recent mergers, potentially making Ca-rich SNe new probes of
both the galaxy merger rate and (binary) SMBH population. (abridged)

comes together with a modification of the chiral fermion density. We study in

dynamical evolution of the magnetic fields, magnetic helicity density, and
chiral fermion imbalance. Depending on the initial conditions we observe how
the helicity might be transferred from the fermions to the magnetic fields, or
vice versa, and find that the rate of this transfer also depends on the scale
of wavelengths of the gauge fields in consideration. We then focus our
attention on the quark-gluon plasma phase, and analyze the dynamical evolution
of the chiral magnetic effect in a very simple toy model. We conclude that an

the limitations of the advection scheme, where black holes are rapidly and

of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of
protostellar outflows by producing synthetic $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0)
observations of numerical simulations. We use various ALMA configurations,
observational parameters, and outflow inclinations to assess how accurately
different assumptions and setups can recover underlying properties. We find
that more compact arrays and longer observing times can improve the mass and
momentum recovery by a factor of two. During the first $\sim$0.3 Myr of
evolution, $^{12}$CO(1-0) is optically thick, even for velocities $|v|\ge 1$ km
s$^{-1}$, and outflow mass is severely underestimated without an optical depth
correction. Likewise, $^{13}$CO(1-0) is optically thick during the first
$\simeq 0.1$ Myr. However, underestimation due to shorter observing time,
missing flux, and optical depth are partially offset by the assumption of local
thermodynamic equilibrium and higher excitation temperatures. Overall, we
expect that full ALMA $^{13}$CO(1-0) observations of protostellar sources

further elaborations and counterexamples with regard to the sigma-unitality
hypothesis. We produce a natural one-to-one correspondence between complete
order isomorphisms of C*-algebras and invertible left multipliers of
imprimitivity bimodules. A corollary of the above two results is that any
complete order isomorphism between sigma-unital C*-algebras is the composite of
an isomorphism with an inner complete order isomorphism. We give a separable
counterexample to a question of Akemann and Pedersen; namely, the space of
quasi-multipliers is not linearly generated by left and right multipliers. But
we show that the space of quasi-multipliers is multiplicatively generated by
left and right multipliers in the sigma-unital case. In particular every
positive quasi-multiplier is of the form T*T for T a left multiplier. We show
that a Lie theory consequence of the negative result just stated is that the
map sending T to T*T need not be open, even for very nice C*-algebras. We show
that surjective maps between sigma-unital C*-algebras induce surjective maps on
left, right, and quasi-multipliers. (The more significant similar result for
multipliers is Pedersen's ""Non-commutative Tietze extension theorem."") We
elaborate the relations of the above results with continuous fields of Hilbert

subdivided models are applied to closed vacuum $\Lambda$-FLRW universes. In
each case, we embed the Regge Cauchy surfaces into 3-spheres in $\mathbf{E}^4$
and consider possible measures of Cauchy surface radius that can be derived
from the embedding. Regge equations are obtained from both global variation,
where entire sets of identical edges get varied simultaneously, and local
variation, where each edge gets varied individually. We explore the
relationship between the two sets of solutions, the conditions under which the
Regge Hamiltonian constraint would be a first integral of the evolution
equation, the initial value equation for each model at its moment of time
symmetry, and the performance of the various models. It is revealed that local
variation does not generally lead to a viable Regge model. It is also
demonstrated that the various models do satisfy their respective initial value
equations. Finally, it is shown that the models reproduce the behaviour of the
continuum model rather well initially, with performance improving as we
increase the number of tetrahedra used to construct the Regge Cauchy surface.
Eventually though, all models gradually fail to keep up with the continuum FLRW
model's expansion, with the models with lower numbers of tetrahedra falling
away more quickly. We believe this failure to keep up is due to the finite
resolution of the Regge Cauchy surfaces trying to approximate an ever expanding
continuum Cauchy surface; each Regge surface has a fixed number of tetrahedra
and as the surface being approximated gets larger, the resolution would
degrade. Finally, we note that all Regge models end abruptly at a point when
the time-like struts of the skeleton become null, though this end-point appears
to get delayed as the number of tetrahedra is increased.

coarse-grained rates obey a local detailed balance condition and reproduce the

analysis reveals that only by assuming unrealistically fast probe particles,
the coarse-grained transition rates coincide with the transition rates of the

methods are often used because they tend to preserve the distribution of the
imputed variable. Among the random imputation methods, the random hot-deck has
the interesting property of imputing observed values. A new random hot-deck
imputation method is proposed. The key innovation of this method is that the
selection of donors is viewed as a sampling problem and uses calibration and
balanced sampling. This approach makes it possible to select donors such that
if the auxiliary variables were imputed, their estimated totals would not
change. As a consequence, very accurate and stable totals estimations can be
obtained. Moreover, the method is based on a nonparametric procedure. Donors
are selected in neighborhoods of recipients. In this way, the missing value of
a recipient is replaced with an observed value of a similar unit. This new
approach is very flexible and can greatly improve the quality of estimations.
Also, this method is unbiased under very different models and is thus resistant
to model misspecification. Finally, the new method makes it possible to
introduce edit rules while imputing.

representations of objects (eg., words, image parts), relations (eg., sentence
structures), and sequences for use with machine learning algorithms. They
consist of a vector addition operator for representing a collection of
unordered objects, a Binding operator for associating groups of objects, and a
methodology for encoding complex structures.
  We first develop Constraints that machine learning imposes upon VSAs: for
example, similar structures must be represented by similar vectors. The
constraints suggest that current VSAs should represent phrases (""The smart
Brazilian girl"") by binding sums of terms, in addition to simply binding the
terms directly.
  We show that matrix multiplication can be used as the binding operator for a
VSA, and that matrix elements can be chosen at random. A consequence for living
systems is that binding is mathematically possible without the need to specify,
in advance, precise neuron-to-neuron connection properties for large numbers of
synapses.
  A VSA that incorporates these ideas, MBAT (Matrix Binding of Additive Terms),
is described that satisfies all Constraints.
  With respect to machine learning, for some types of problems appropriate VSA
representations permit us to prove learnability, rather than relying on
simulations. We also propose dividing machine (and neural) learning and
representation into three Stages, with differing roles for learning in each
stage.
  For neural modeling, we give ""representational reasons"" for nervous systems
to have many recurrent connections, as well as for the importance of phrases in
language processing.
  Sizing simulations and analyses suggest that VSAs in general, and MBAT in
particular, are ready for real-world applications.

Nevertheless, four PNe are known in Galactic GCs. Their existence likely
requires more exotic evolutionary channels, including stellar mergers and
common-envelope binary interactions. I carried out a snapshot imaging search
with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for PNe in bright Local Group GCs outside
the Milky Way. I used a filter covering the 5007 A nebular emission line of [O
III], and another one in the nearby continuum, to image 66 GCs. Inclusion of
archival HST frames brought the total number of extragalactic GCs imaged at
5007 A to 75, whose total luminosity slightly exceeds that of the entire
Galactic GC system. I found no convincing PNe in these clusters, aside from one
PN in a young M31 cluster misclassified as a GC, and two PNe at such large
angular separations from an M31 GC that membership is doubtful. In a
ground-based spectroscopic survey of 274 old GCs in M31, Jacoby et al. (2013)
found three candidate PNe. My HST images of one of them suggest that the [O
III] emission actually arises from ambient interstellar medium rather than a
PN; for the other two candidates, there are broad-band archival UV HST images
that show bright, blue point sources that are probably the PNe. In a literature
search, I also identified five further PN candidates lying near old GCs in M31,
for which follow-up observations are necessary to confirm their membership. The
rates of incidence of PNe are similar, and small but non-zero, throughout the

mechanism to amplify the magnetic field in fast rotating protoneutron stars. In
contrast to accretion disks, radial buoyancy driven by entropy and lepton
fraction gradients is expected to have a dynamical role as important as
rotation and shear. We investigate the poorly known impact of buoyancy on the
non-linear phase of the MRI, by means of three dimensional numerical
simulations of a local model in the equatorial plane of a protoneutron star.
The use of the Boussinesq approximation allows us to utilise a shearing box
model with clean shearing periodic boundary conditions, while taking into
account the buoyancy driven by radial entropy and composition gradients. We
find significantly stronger turbulence and magnetic fields in buoyantly
unstable flows. On the other hand, buoyancy has only a limited impact on the
strength of turbulence and magnetic field amplification for buoyantly stable
flows in the presence of a realistic thermal diffusion. The properties of the
turbulence are, however, significantly affected in the latter case. In
particular, the toroidal components of the magnetic field and of the velocity
become even more dominant with respect to the poloidal ones. Furthermore, we
observed in the regime of stable buoyancy the formation of long lived coherent
structures such as channel flows and zonal flows. Overall, our results support
the ability of the MRI to amplify the magnetic field significantly even in
stably stratified regions of protoneutron stars.

over subadditive valuations with independent items, then the better of pricing
each item separately or pricing only the grand bundle achieves a
constant-factor approximation to the revenue of the optimal mechanism. This
includes buyers who are k-demand, additive up to a matroid constraint, or
additive up to constraints of any downwards-closed set system (and whose values
for the individual items are sampled independently), as well as buyers who are
fractionally subadditive with item multipliers drawn independently. Our proof
makes use of the core-tail decomposition framework developed in prior work
showing similar results for the significantly simpler class of additive buyers
[LY13, BILW14].
  In the second part of the paper, we develop a connection between
approximately optimal simple mechanisms and approximate revenue monotonicity
with respect to buyers' valuations. Revenue non-monotonicity is the phenomenon
that sometimes strictly increasing buyers' values for every set can strictly
decrease the revenue of the optimal mechanism [HR12]. Using our main result, we
derive a bound on how bad this degradation can be (and dub such a bound a proof
of approximate revenue monotonicity); we further show that better bounds on
approximate monotonicity imply a better analysis of our simple mechanisms.

from the hot gas. Gas experiencing the largest entropy loss cools first,
followed by gas with progressively less entropy loss. Most cooling occurs at

cools intermittently, forming clouds near the cluster center. Single cavities

us to develop effective adaptive sparse channel estimation (ASCE) methods to

possibilities that together seem to better explain this component of our
Galaxy. All these processes must affect differently in distinct types of
galaxies, but the contribution of each one has not been straightforward to
quantify. In this work, we present a first comprehensive study of the effect of
the spiral arms in the formation of thick disks, as going from early to late
type disk galaxies, in an attempt to characterize and quantify this specific
mechanism in galactic potentials. To this purpose, we perform numerical
simulations of test particles in a three-dimensional spiral galaxy potential of
normal spiral galaxies (from early to late types). By varying the parameters of
the spiral arms we found that the vertical heating of the stellar disk becomes
very important in some cases, and strongly depends on the galaxy morphology,
pitch angle, arms mass and its pattern speed. The later the galaxy type, the
larger is the effect on the disk heating. This study shows that the physical
mechanism causing the vertical heating is different from simple resonant
excitation. The spiral pattern induce chaotic behavior not linked necessarily
to resonances but to direct scattering of disk stars, which leads to an
increase of the velocity dispersion. We applied this study to the specific
example of the Milky Way Galaxy, for which we have also added an experiment
that includes the Galactic bar. From this study we deduce that the effect of
spiral arms of a Milky-Way-like potential, on the dynamical vertical heating of
the disk is negligible, unlike later galactic potentials for disks.

application is a new functional limit theorem, or invariance principle, for
theta sums. The interesting observation here is that the paths of the limiting
process share a number of key features with Brownian motion (scale invariance,
invariance under time inversion, non-differentiability), although time

to date have focused only on X-ray observations of local Seyferts and a few
higher redshift quasars. Here we show the clear detection of a powerful AGN
accretion disk wind with a mildly relativistic velocity of 0.25c in the X-ray
spectrum of IRAS F11119+3257, a nearby (z = 0.189) optically classified type 1
ULIRG hosting a powerful molecular outflow. The AGN is responsible for ~80% of
the emission, with a quasar-like luminosity of L_AGN = 1.5x10^46 erg/s. The
energetics of these winds are consistent with the energy-conserving mechanism,
which is the basis of the quasar mode feedback in AGN lacking powerful radio
jets.

can be carried over to a stochastic neutrino background but with the Planck
scale of the gravitational decoherence replaced by the weak scale. This implies
that it might be possible to observe such neutrino induced decoherence on a
small, microscopic system rather than a macroscopic system as is the case for
gravitationally induced decoherence. In particular we suggest that neutrino
decoherence could be linked with observed variations in the decay rates of
certain nuclei. Finally we point out that this proposed neutrino induced

transitions (then the initial and final systems are same), nuclear beta and
double beta decay (then the initial and final systems are different), particle
addition to or removal from a given system and so on. Working towards
developing a complete statistical theory for transition strength densities
(transition strengths multiplied by the density of states at the initial and

order bivariate moments of the strength densities generated by a variety of
transition operators. In this paper results are presented for a transition
operator that removes $k_0$ number of particle by considering $m$ spinless
fermions in $N$ single particle states. The Hamiltonian that is $k$-body is
represented by EGUE($k$) [embedded Gaussian unitary ensemble of $k$-body

bivariate Gaussian form. Extension of these results to particle addition

pursue. In this update, we report on the progress on this topic in the last
five years after our last review. We begin with how is Lorentz/Poincar\'e group
in local physics arisen from spacetime structure as seen by photon and matter
through experiments/observations. The cosmic verification of the Galileo
Equivalence Principle for photons/electromagnetic wave packets (Universality of
Propagation in spacetime independent of photon energy and polarization, i.e.
nonbirefringence) constrains the spacetime constitutive tensor to high
precision to a core metric form with an axion degree and a dilaton degree of
freedom. Hughes-Drever-type experiments then constrain this core metric to
agree with the matter metric. Thus comes the metric with axion and dilation. In
local physics this metric gives the Lorentz/Poincar\'e covariance. Constraints
on axion and dilaton from polarized/unpolarized laboratory/astrophysical/cosmic
experiments/observations are presented. In the end, we review the theoretical
progress on the issue of gyrogravitational ratio for fundamental particles and
the experimental progress on the measurements of possible long

nonlinear regime of the mirror instability in the framework of an asymptotic
model. This model belongs to the class of gradient type systems for which the
free energy can only decrease in time. It reveals a behavior typical for
subcritical bifurcations: below the mirror instability threshold, all localized
stationary structures are unstable, while above threshold, the system displays
a blow-up behavior. It is shown that taking the electrons into account
(non-zero temperature) does not change the structure of the asymptotic model.
For bi-Maxwellian distribution functions for both electrons and ions, the model
predicts the formation of magnetic holes. The second part contains original
results concerning two-dimensional steady mirror structures which can form in
the saturated regime. Based on Grad-Shafranov-like equations, a gyrotropic
plasma, where the pressures in the static regime are only functions of the
amplitude of the local magnetic field, is shown to be amenable to a variational
principle with a free energy density given by the parallel tension. This
approach is used to demonstrate that small-amplitude static holes constructed
slightly below the mirror instability threshold identify with lump solitons of
KPII equation and turn out to be unstable. It is also shown that regularizing
effects such as finite Larmor radius corrections cannot be ignored in the
description of large-amplitude mirror structures. Using the gradient method,
which is based on a variational principle for anisotropic MHD taking into
account ion finite Larmor radius effects, we found both one-dimensional
magnetic structures in the form of stripes and two-dimensional bubbles when the
magnetic field component transverse to the plane is increased. These structures
realize minimum of the free energy.

daunting due to their particle statistics, and Feynman left as an open question
whether it could be done, because of the need for non-local control. Here, we
implement fermionic interactions with digital techniques in a superconducting
circuit. Focusing on the Hubbard model, we perform time evolution with constant
interactions as well as a dynamic phase transition with up to four fermionic
modes encoded in four qubits. The implemented digital approach is universal and
allows for the efficient simulation of fermions in arbitrary spatial
dimensions. We use in excess of 300 single-qubit and two-qubit gates, and reach
global fidelities which are limited by gate errors. This demonstration
highlights the feasibility of the digital approach and opens a viable route

often vary across life stages. Studies specifically aimed at assessing tree
survival are unusual and so data initially designed for other purposes often
need to be used; such data are more likely to contain errors than data
collected for this specific purpose. We investigate the survival rates of ten
tree species in a dataset designed to monitor growth rates. As some individuals
were not included in the census at some time points we use
capture-mark-recapture methods both to allow us to account for missing
individuals, and to estimate relocation probabilities. Growth rates, size, and
light availability were included as covariates in the model predicting survival
rates. The study demonstrates that tree mortality is best described as constant
between years and size-dependent at early life stages and size independent at
later life stages for most species of UK hardwood. We have demonstrated that
even with a twenty-year dataset it is possible to discern variability both
between individuals and between species. Our work illustrates the potential

measurement equation (RIME) in support of the Bayesian inference for radio
observations (BIRO) technique. BIRO uses Bayesian inference to select sky
models that best match the visibilities observed by a radio interferometer. To
accomplish this, BIRO evaluates the RIME multiple times, varying sky model
parameters to produce multiple model visibilities. Chi-squared values computed
from the model and observed visibilities are used as likelihood values to drive
the Bayesian sampling process and select the best sky model.
  As most of the elements of the RIME and chi-squared calculation are
independent of one another, they are highly amenable to parallel computation.
Additionally, Montblanc caters for iterative RIME evaluation to produce
multiple chi-squared values. Modified model parameters are transferred to the
GPU between each iteration.
  We implemented Montblanc as a Python package based upon NVIDIA's CUDA
architecture. As such, it is easy to extend and implement different pipelines.
At present, Montblanc supports point and Gaussian morphologies, but is designed
for easy addition of new source profiles.
  Montblanc's RIME implementation is performant: On an NVIDIA K40, it is
approximately 250 times faster than MeqTrees on a dual hexacore Intel E5-2620v2
CPU. Compared to the OSKAR simulator's GPU-implemented RIME components it is
7.7 and 12 times faster on the same K40 for single and double-precision
floating point respectively. However, OSKAR's RIME implementation is more
general than Montblanc's BIRO-tailored RIME.
  Theoretical analysis of Montblanc's dominant CUDA kernel suggests that it is
memory bound. In practice, profiling shows that is balanced between compute and
memory, as much of the data required by the problem is retained in L1 and L2
cache.

A*, length scales of ~41 and 55 microarcseconds and timescales of 50 and 79 min
respectively should be associated with resonant effects, if Sgr A* is
non-spinning. Spin decreases these values by up to ~32% and ~28%. These
length-scales are potentially resolvable with VLBI measurements. We find that
all low-order resonances are localized to the strong field region r < 50 Rs.
This fact guarantees the validity of using approximations based on averaging to
model the frequency evolution of a test object in region 50 Rs <r <1000 Rs. The
systematic determination of the multipole moments of the central object by
observing the orbit of a pulsar, free of chaotic effects, is thus possible.

too massive and its momentum too large to be accounted for by any but the
core-degenerate (CD) scenario for type Ia supernovae. Assuming the absorbing
gas is of CSM origin, the several shells responsible of the absorption
potassium lines are accounted for by a mass loss episode from a massive
asymptotic giant branch star during a common envelope phase with a white dwarf
companion. The time-varying potassium lines can be accounted for by ionization
of neutral potassium and the Na-from-dust absorption (NaDA) model. Before
explosion some of the potassium resides in the gas phase and some in dust.
Weakening in absorption strength is caused by potassium-ionizing radiation of
the supernova, while release of atomic potassium from dust increases the
absorption. I conclude that if the absorbing gas originated from the progenitor
of SN 2014J, then a common envelope phase took place about 15,000 years ago,
leading to the merging of the core with the white dwarf companion, i.e., the
core-degenerate scenario. Else, the absorbing material is of interstellar
medium origin.

nebula NGC 7023 displays a complex structure. Filament-like condensations at
the edge of the cloud can be traced via the emission of the main cooling lines,
offering a great opportunity to study the link between the morphology and
energetics of these regions. Aims: We study the spatial variation of the
far-infrared fine-structure lines of [C II] (158 um) and [O I] (63 and 145 um).
These lines trace the local gas conditions across the PDR. Methods: We used
observations from the Herschel/PACS instrument to map the spatial distribution
of these fine-structure lines. The observed region covers a square area of
about 110"" x 110"" with an angular resolution that varies from 4"" to 11"". We
compared this emission with ground-based and Spitzer observations of H2 lines,
Herschel/SPIRE observations of CO lines, and Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 um images that
trace the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Results: The [C II]
(158 um) and [O I] (63 and 145 um) lines arise from the warm cloud surface
where the PDR is located and the gas is warm, cooling the region. We find that
although the relative contribution to the cooling budget over the observed
region is dominated by [O I]63 um (>30%), H2 contributes significantly in the
PDR (35%), as does [C II]158 um outside the PDR (30%). Other species contribute
little to the cooling ([O I]145 um 9%, and CO 4%). The [O I] maps resolve these
condensations into two structures and show that the peak of [O I] is slightly
displaced from the molecular H2 emission. The size of these structures is about
8"" (0.015 pc) and in surface cover about 9% of the PDR emission. Finally, we
did not detect emission from [N II]122 um, suggesting that the cavity is mostly
filled with non-ionised gas.

proposed, e.g., core-collapse supernovae or neutron star mergers. Old
metal-poor stars carry the signature of the astrophysical source(s). Among the
elements dominantly made by the r-process, europium (Eu) is relatively easy to
observe. In this work we simulate the evolution of europium in our galaxy with
the inhomogeneous chemical evolution model 'ICE', and compare our results with
spectroscopic observations. We test the most important parameters affecting the
chemical evolution of Eu: (a) for neutron star mergers the coalescence time
scale of the merger ($t_{\mathrm{coal}}$) and the probability to experience a
neutron star merger event after two supernova explosions occurred and formed a
double neutron star system ($P_{\mathrm{NSM}}$) and (b) for the sub-class of
magneto-rotationally driven supernovae (""Jet-SNe""), their occurrence rate
compared to standard supernovae ($P_{\mathrm{Jet-SN}}$). We find that the
observed [Eu/Fe] pattern in the galaxy can be reproduced by a combination of
neutron star mergers and magneto-rotationally driven supernovae as r-process
sources. While neutron star mergers alone seem to set in at too high
metallicities, Jet-SNe provide a cure for this deficiency at low metallicities.
Furthermore, we confirm that local inhomogeneities can explain the observed
large spread in the europium abundances at low metallicities. We also predict
the evolution of [O/Fe] to test whether the spread in $\alpha$-elements for
inhomogeneous models agrees with observations and whether this provides
constraints on supernova explosion models and their nucleosynthesis.

selection of links with better quality. Further, the existing friendship-based

design in opportunistic networks. We propose a New Friendship-based routing
with buffer management based on Copy Utility, named NFCU. NFCU algorithm, which
not only considers the contact periods in constructing social pressure metric

efficiently, but also considers the buffer management, that can efficiently
determine which copy of the message should be deleted timely according to the

significantly, and increase the message delivery ratio. The extensive

reconstruction or extrapolation methods aim at recovering these missing data.
Here, we present a simple and robust method which exploits a different view on
the Gibbs-phenomena. The truncation in k-space can be interpreted as a
convolution with a sinc-function in image space. Hence, the severity of the
artifacts depends on how the sinc-function is sampled. We propose to
re-interpolate the image based on local, subvoxel shifts to sample the ringing
pattern at the zero-crossings of the oscillating sinc-function. With this, the
artifact can effectively and robustly be removed with a minimal amount of

merger trees obtained from cosmological $N$-body simulations are used to
identify infall halos that are about to merge with their hosts. We find that
the tangential component of the infall velocity increases significantly with
the strength of the local tidal field, but no strong correlation is found for
the radial component. These results can be used to explain how the internal
velocity anisotropy and spin of halos depend on environment. The position
vectors and velocities of infall halos are aligned with the principal axes of
the local tidal field, and the alignment depends on the strength of the tidal
field. Opposite accretion patterns are found in weak and strong tidal fields,
in the sense that in a weak field the accretion flow is dominated by radial
motion within the local structure, while a large tangential component is
present in a strong field. These findings can be used to understand the strong
alignments we find between the principal axes of the internal velocity
ellipsoids of halos and the local tidal field, and their dependence on the
strength of tidal field. They also explain why halo spin increases with the
strength of local tidal field, but only in weak tidal fields does the
spin-tidal field alignment follow the prediction of the tidal torque theory. We
discuss how our results may be used to understand the spins of disk galaxies

possible to accurately predict the impact of a modification with the simplicity
of a random split across users. One of the critical aspects of an AB-test is
its duration and it is important to reliably compute confidence intervals
associated with the metric of interest to know when to stop the test. In this
paper, we define a clean mathematical framework to model the AB-test process.
We then propose three algorithms based on bootstrapping and on the central
limit theorem to compute reliable confidence intervals which extend to other
metrics than the common probabilities of success. They apply to both absolute
and relative increments of the most used comparison metrics, including the
number of occurrences of a particular event and a click-through rate implying a

and those for HI and Av in M31 are nearly identical. However, the PDFs for H2
are wider than the HI PDFs and the M51 PDFs have larger dispersions than those
for M31. We use a simple model to determine how the PDFs are changed by
variations in the line-of-sight (LOS) pathlength L through the gas, telescope
resolution and the volume filling factor of the gas, f_v. In each of these
cases the dispersion sigma of the lognormal PDF depends on the variable with a
negative power law. We also derive PDFs of mean LOS volume densities of gas
components in M31 and M51. Combining these with the volume density PDFs for
different components of the ISM in the Milky Way (MW), we find that sigma
decreases with increasing length L with an exponent of -0.76 +/- 0.06, which is
steeper than expected. We show that the difference is due to variations in f_v.
As f_v is similar in M31, M51 and the MW, the density structure in the gas in
these galaxies must be similar. Finally, we demonstrate that an increase in f_v
with increasing distance to the Galactic plane explains the decrease in sigma
with latitude of the PDFs of emission measure and FUV emission observed for the
MW.

with methods from polyhedral geometry. In particular, we combine MacMahon's
iterative approach based on the Omega operator and explicit formulas for its
evaluation with geometric tools such as Brion decompositions and Barvinok's
short rational function representations. In this way, we connect two recent

is significantly faster than previous solvers based on partition analysis and
it is competitive with state-of-the-art LDS solvers based on geometric methods.

locality is exploited without prior information about the matrix sparsity

implement due to our recent development of the Chunks and Tasks programming
model [Parallel Comput. 40, 328 (2014)]. The quadtree representation combined
with the Chunks and Tasks model leads to favorable weak and strong scaling of
the communication cost with the number of processes, as shown both
theoretically and in numerical experiments.
  Matrices are represented by sparse quadtrees of chunk objects. The leaves in
the hierarchy are block-sparse submatrices. Sparsity is dynamically detected by
the matrix library and may occur at any level in the hierarchy and/or within
the submatrix leaves. In case graphics processing units (GPUs) are available,
both CPUs and GPUs are used for leaf-level multiplication work, thus making use
of the full computing capacity of each node.
  The performance is evaluated for matrices with different sparsity structures,
including examples from electronic structure calculations. Compared to methods
that do not exploit data locality, our locality-aware approach reduces
communication significantly, achieving essentially constant communication per
node in weak scaling tests.

order to achieve an objective. A computerised workflow management system may
enforce authorisation policies and constraints, thereby restricting which users
can perform particular steps in a workflow. The existence of policies and
constraints may mean that a workflow is unsatisfiable, in the sense that it is
impossible to find an authorised user for each step in the workflow and satisfy
all constraints. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the ""least
bad"" assignment of users to workflow steps by assigning a weight to each policy
and constraint violation. To this end, we introduce a framework for associating
costs with the violation of workflow policies and constraints and define the
\emph{valued workflow satisfiability problem} (Valued WSP), whose solution is
an assignment of steps to users of minimum cost. We establish the computational
complexity of Valued WSP with user-independent constraints and show that it is
fixed-parameter tractable. We then describe an algorithm for solving Valued WSP
with user-independent constraints and evaluate its performance, comparing it to
that of an off-the-shelf mixed integer programming package.

a multidimensional array (tensor) response and a vector predictor. Applications
include, among others, comparing tensor images across groups after adjusting
for additional covariates, which is of central interest in neuroimaging
analysis. We propose parsimonious tensor response regression adopting a
generalized sparsity principle. It models all voxels of the tensor response
jointly, while accounting for the inherent structural information among the
voxels. It effectively reduces the number of free parameters, leading to
feasible computation and improved interpretation. We achieve model estimation
through a nascent technique called the envelope method, which identifies the
immaterial information and focuses the estimation based upon the material
information in the tensor response. We demonstrate that the resulting estimator
is asymptotically efficient, and it enjoys a competitive finite sample
performance. We also illustrate the new method on two real neuroimaging

formation is unlikely to occur in the halo, they must have been formed in the

HD\,271791 is the kinematically most extreme runaway star known (Galactic
restframe velocity $725 \pm 195\, \rm km\,s^{-1}$, which is even larger than
the Galactic escape velocity). Moreover, an analysis of the optical spectrum
showed an enhancement of the $\alpha$-process elements. This indicates the
capture of supernova ejecta, and therefore an origin in a core-collapse
supernova. As such high space velocities are not reached by the runaway stars
in classical binary supernova ejection scenarios, a very massive but compact
primary, probably of Wolf-Rayet type is required. HD\,271791 is therefore a
perfect candidate for studying nucleosynthesis in a supernova of probably type
Ibc. The goal of this project is to determine the abundances of a large number
of elements from the $\alpha$-process, the iron group, and heavier elements by
a quantitative analysis of the optical and UV spectral range. Detailed

field generation process in the Sun and likely in other stars. The term
solar-like differential rotation describes the observation that solar
equatorial regions rotate faster than polar ones. The opposite effect of polar
regions rotating faster than equatorial ones (termed as antisolar DR) has only
been observed in a few stars, although there is evidence from theoretical
dynamo models. We present a new method to detect the sign of DR (i.e.
solar-like or antisolar DR) by analyzing long-term high-precision light curves
with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram.We compute the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and
identify a set of significant periods $P_k$, which we associate with active
regions located at different latitudes on the the stellar surface. If
detectable, the first harmonics ($P_k'$) of these periods were identified to
compute their peak-height-ratios $r_k:=h(P_k')/h(P_k)$. Spots rotating at lower
latitudes generate less sine-shaped light curves, which requires additional
power in the harmonics, and results in larger ratios $r_k$. Comparing different
ratios $r_k$ and the associated periods $P_k$ yields information about the spot
latitudes, and reveals the sign of DR. We tested our method on different sets
of synthetic light curves all exhibiting solar-like DR. The number of cases
where our method detects antisolar DR is the false-positive rate of our method.
Depending on the set of light curves, the noise level, the required minimum
peak separation, and the presence or absence of spot evolution, our method
fails to detect the correct sign in at most 20%. We applied our method to 50
Kepler G stars and found 21-34 stars with solar-like DR and 5-10 stars with
antisolar DR, depending on the minimum peak separation.

hyperbolic invariant curves. These hyperbolae are mapped by a canonical
transformation $\Phi$ to the plane $(x,y)$, giving ""Moser invariant curves"". We
find that the series $\Phi$ are convergent up to a maximum value of
$c=c_{max}$. We give estimates of the errors due to the finite truncation of
the series and discuss how these errors affect the applicability of analytical
computations. For values of the basic parameter $\kappa$ of the H\'{e}non map
smaller than a critical value, there is an island of stability, around a stable
periodic orbit $S$, containing KAM invariant curves. The Moser curves for $c
\leq 0.32$ are completely outside the last KAM curve around $S$, the curves
with $0.32<c<0.41$ intersect the last KAM curve and the curves with $0.41\leq
c< c_{max} \simeq 0.49$ are completely inside the last KAM curve. All orbits in
the chaotic region around the periodic orbit $(x=y=0)$, although they seem
random, belong to Moser invariant curves, which, therefore define a ""structure
of chaos"". Orbits starting close and outside the last KAM curve remain close to
it for a stickiness time that is estimated analytically using the series
$\Phi$. We finally calculate the periodic orbits that accumulate close to the
homoclinic points, i.e. the points of intersection of the asymptotic curves
from $x=y=0$, exploiting a method based on the self-intersections of the

cavity in Higgs condensate. The surface tension of the cavity prevents the
electron from flying apart due to Coulomb repulsion. A similar model was
introduced by Dirac in 1962, though without reference to Higgs condensate. In
his model, the equilibrium radius of the electron equals the classical electron
radius, $R^{c}_{e} \simeq 2.8 \times 10^{-13}$ cm, that is about $10^{5}$ times
the radius consistent with experimental data. To address this problem, we
replace the Coulomb term in the total energy of the electron by fermion
self-energy involving screening by electrons occupying the negative energies of
the vacuum. The tension of the cavity is obtained using the approximation
$\xi_{0} \ll R_{0}$ where $\xi_{0}$ is the coherence length. For $\xi_{0} =
10^{-3} R_{0}$, the equilibrium radius in this model is $R_{0} \simeq 9.2

  For such a small radius, we find the gravitational energy of the electron to
be large enough to cancel the energy $\hbar c/R$, coming from the vibrational
zero point energy and the kinetic energy of the embedded electron.

a sharp X-ray surface brightness edge in the deep Chandra image of the cluster

on the opposite side of the cluster to the famous bow shock. This new example
of an X-ray shock coincident with a relic further supports the hypothesis that
shocks in the outer regions of clusters can form relics via diffusive shock
(re-)acceleration. Intriguingly, our new relic suggests that seed electrons for
reacceleration are coming from a local remnant of a radio galaxy, which we are
lucky to catch before its complete disruption. If this scenario, in which a
relic forms when a shock crosses a well-defined region of the ICM polluted with
aged relativistic plasma -- as opposed to the usual assumption that seeds are
uniformly mixed in the ICM -- is also the case for other relics, this may

accepted development from the product of three heuristic factors continues to
obscure it's real underlying simplicity. Starting instead from a
symmetric-antisymmetric reformulation we first show SSIM to be a contrast or
visibility function in the classic sense. Furthermore, the previously enigmatic
structural covariance is revealed to be the difference of variances. The second
step, eliminating the intrinsic quadratic nature of SSIM, allows a near linear
correlation with human observer scores, and without invoking the usual, but
arbitrary, sigmoid model fitting. We conclude that SSIM can be re-interpreted
in terms of perceptual masking: it is essentially equivalent to a normalised
error or noise visibility function (NVF), and, furthermore, the NVF alone
explains it success in modelling perceptual image quality. We use the term
Dissimilarity Quotient (DQ) for the specifically anti/symmetric SSIM derived
NVF. It seems that IQA researchers may now have two choices: 1) Continue to use
the complex SSIM formula, but noting that SSIM only works coincidentally since
the covariance term is actually the mean square error (MSE) in disguise. 2) Use
the simplest of all perceptually-masked image quality metrics, namely NVF or
DQ. On this choice Occam is clear: in the absence of differences in predictive
ability, the fewer assumptions that are made, the better.
