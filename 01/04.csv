proved to be an effective way to compare absolutely continuous curves in $R^N$

based on this method. In this paper, we carefully establish the theoretical
foundations of the SRVF method. In particular, we analyze the quotient
construction of the set of absolutely continuous curves modulo the group (or in
some cases, semigroup) of reparametrizations, proving an important theorem
about the structure of the closed orbits required in this quotient
construction. We observe that the set of piecewise linear curves is dense in
the space of absolutely continuous curves with respect to the SRVF metric.
Finally, given two piecewise linear curves, we establish a precise algorithm
for producing the optimal matching between these curves. This also results in a
precise determination of the geodesic between the points in the quotient space
corresponding to these curves. In the past, this geodesic has only been
approximated using the method of Dynamic Programming. We show examples
resulting from this algorithm.

Milky Way. We present high-quality spectroscopic data for 14 stream member
stars obtained using the Keck and MMT telescopes. We confirm the stream as a
fast moving ($v_{los}\sim290$ km s$^{-1}$), kinematically cold group
($\sigma_{v_{los}}\lesssim1$ km s$^{-1}$) of $\alpha$-enhanced and metal-poor
stars (${\rm [\alpha/Fe]\sim0.4}$ dex, ${\rm [Fe/H]\sim-2.0}$ dex). Using a
probabilistic technique, we model the stream simultaneously in line-of-sight
velocity, color-magnitude, coordinate, and proper motion space, and so
determine its distribution in 6D phase-space. We find that that the stream
extends in distance from 7.5 to 9 kpc from the Sun; it is 50 times longer than
wide, merely appearing highly foreshortened in projection. The analysis of the
stellar population contained in the stream suggests that it is $\sim12$ Gyr
old, and that its initial stellar mass was $\sim2\times10^4$ $M_{\odot}$ (or at
least $\gtrsim7\times10^3$ $M_{\odot}$). Assuming a fiducial Milky Way
potential, we fit an orbit to the stream which matches the observed phase-space
distribution, except for some tension in the proper motions: the stream has an
orbital period of $\sim350$ Myr, and is on a fairly eccentric orbit
($e\sim0.66$) with a pericenter of $\sim3.5$ kpc and an apocenter of $\sim17$
kpc. The phase-space structure and stellar population of the stream show that
its progenitor must have been a globular cluster that was disrupted only
$\sim240$ Myr ago. We do not detect any significant overdensity of stars along
the stream that would indicate the presence of a progenitor, and conclude that
the stream is all that is left of the progenitor.

probability per class and the source rate per class, in such a way that the
overall system utility is maximized. We then propose a heuristic-based
algorithm for the selection of the transmission strategy, which is built on
intrinsic characteristics of the iterative decoding methods adopted for

integrated mean curvature) of their associated Voronoi cells. The probability
distribution functions of these functionals of Voronoi cells in MRJ sphere
packings are qualitatively similar to those of an equilibrium hard-sphere
liquid and partly even to the uncorrelated Poisson point process, implying that
such local statistics are relatively structurally insensitive. This is not
surprising because the Minkowski functionals of a single Voronoi cell
incorporate only local information and are insensitive to global structural
information. To improve upon this, we introduce descriptors that incorporate
nonlocal information via the correlation functions of the Minkowski functionals
of two cells at a given distance as well as certain cell-cell probability
density functions. We evaluate these higher-order functions for our MRJ
packings as well as equilibrium hard spheres and the Poisson point process. We
find strong anticorrelations in the Voronoi volumes for the hyperuniform MRJ
packings, consistent with previous findings for other pair correlations [A.
Donev et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 090604 (2005)], indicating that large-scale
volume fluctuations are suppressed by accompanying large Voronoi cells with
small cells, and vice versa. In contrast to the aforementioned local Voronoi
statistics, the correlation functions of the Voronoi cells qualitatively
distinguish the structure of MRJ sphere packings (prototypical glasses) from
that of the correlated equilibrium hard-sphere liquids. Moreover, while we did
not find any perfect icosahedra (the locally densest possible structure in

vital clues about the probabilities that each vertex belongs to different
groups and the centrality of each vertex in its corresponding group. This

dimensionality p of the input space and the sample size n are usually the main
ingredients in the characterization of data bigness. The specific statistical

on which category it falls in within the bigness taxonomy. Large p small n data

rotation by rubidium-87 atoms revealed strong time-dependence of the
polarization plane of light emerging from atomic vapors following a sudden
irradiation with a laser beam. The rotation of the plane appears as a not
direct consequence of the influence of the magnetic field on atoms. Reported
measurements conducted using a vapor cell without any buffer gas or an
anti-relaxation wall coating show that transmitted light has initially the same
(linear) polarization as the incident one. Rotation of the polarization plane
caused by an axial magnetic field develops in time scales similar to the pace
of establishing the optical pumping/relaxation equilibrium in the atomic
ensemble. The traditional passive Faraday rotation picture providing working
description for the resonant magneto-optical effects in steady-state conditions
does not explain the observed sequence of evolution of the polarization. The
picture has to be augmented with analysis of time dependence in the spatial
distribution of relevant quantum states within the atomic ensemble as well as
longitudinal and transversal intensity profiles of the light beam. Isolation of
external effects caused by the optical pumping and relaxation processes from
consequences of internal atomic coherences should uncover more details of
mechanisms of the latter in the presence of magnetic field. Plentitude of data
available from time-dependent polarization measurements provides strong
incentives for further development and tests of comprehensive models of
coherent interactions of atomic ensembles with radiation and possibly a base

two very different patterns. Historically called ""impulsive"" and ""gradual""
events, they have been studied for 40 years, 20 years by the Wind spacecraft.
Gradual SEP events measure coronal abundances. They are produced when shock
waves, driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), accelerate the ambient coronal
plasma; we discuss the average abundances of 21 elements that differ from
corresponding solar photospheric abundances by a well-known dependence on the
first ionization potential (FIP) of the element. The smaller impulsive
(""3He-rich"") SEP events are associated with magnetic reconnection involving
open field lines from solar flares or jets that also eject plasma to produce
accompanying CMEs. These events produce striking heavy-element abundance
enhancements, relative to coronal abundances, by an average factor of 3 at Ne,
9 at Fe, and 900 for elements with 76<Z<82. This is a strong, power-law
dependence on A/Q with a ~3.6 power when Q values are determined at coronal
temperatures near 3 MK. Small individual SEP events with the steepest
enhancements (~6th power of A/Q), from ~2.5 MK plasma, are associated with B-
and C-class X-ray flares, and with narrow (<100 deg) CMEs. Enhancements in
3He/4He can be as large as those in heavy elements but are uncorrelated with
them. However, events with 3He/4He > 0.1 are even more strongly associated with
narrow, slow CMEs, cooler coronal plasma, and smaller X-ray flares. The
impulsive SEP events do not come from hot flare plasma; they are accelerated
early and/or on adjacent open field lines.

have been shown to be very effective in extracting dominant motion behaviors in
video sequences. Inspired by applications and properties of motion patterns, we
have designed a framework that successfully solves the general task of
trajectory clustering. Our proposed algorithm consists of four phases: flow
vector computation, motion component extraction, motion component's
reachability set creation, and motion pattern formation. For the first phase,
we break down trajectories into flow vectors that indicate instantaneous
movements. In the second phase, via a Kmeans clustering approach, we create
motion components by clustering the flow vectors with respect to their location
and velocity. Next, we create motion components' reachability set in terms of
spatial proximity and motion similarity. Finally, for the fourth phase, we
cluster motion components using agglomerative clustering with the weighted
Jaccard distance between the motion components' signatures, a set created using
path reachability. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method

binary companions (a~<30 AU). The fact that planets can form in these
dynamically challenging environments implies that planet formation must be a
robust process. The initial protoplanetary disks in these systems from which
planets must form should be tidally truncated to radii of a few AU, which
indicates that the efficiency of planet formation must be high. Here, we
examine the truncation of circumstellar protoplanetary disks in close binary
systems, studying how the likelihood of planet formation is affected over a
range of disk parameters. If the semimajor axis of the binary is too small or
its eccentricity is too high, the disk will have too little mass for planet
formation to occur. However, we find that the stars in the binary systems known
to have planets should have once hosted circumstellar disks that were capable
of supporting planet formation despite their truncation. We present a way to
characterize the feasibility of planet formation based on binary orbital
parameters such as stellar mass, companion mass, eccentricity and semi-major
axis. Using this measure, we can quantify the robustness of planet formation in
close binaries and better understand the overall efficiency of planet formation
in general.

Gursky-Malchiodi's work \cite{gur_mal} to solve the prescribed $Q$-curvature

smooth closed manifold, which is not conformally diffeomorphic to the standard
sphere, satisfying either Gursky-Malchiodi's semipositivity hypotheses: scalar
curvature $R_{g_0}>0$ and $Q_{g_0} \geq 0$ not identically zero or Hang-Yang's:
Yamabe constant $Y(g_0)>0$, Paneitz-Sobolev constant $q(g_0)>0$ and $Q_{g_0}

its $Q$-curvature $Q_g$ equal to $f$. This result generalizes Escobar-Schoen's

protocol of such a relaying system, i.e., cooperative relaying with overhearing
AF relays based on STNC (STNC-OHAF) is presented. Then, the instantaneous
end-to-end SNR expression of STNC-OHAF is analysed. Based on this, an explicit

necessarily identically distributed (i.n.i.d) Rayleigh fading channels is
theoretically derived. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and
show that by introducing overhearing among relays, the outage performance of

between system sum outage capacity and the transmitted number of symbols.

  Communications: A Layered Coalitional Game Approach","IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference 2015",,,,"cs.NI cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Device-to-Device (D2D) communications, which allow direct communication among
mobile devices, have been proposed as an enabler of local services in 3GPP
LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) cellular networks. This work investigates a hierarchical
LTE-A network framework consisting of multiple D2D operators at the upper layer
and a group of devices at the lower layer. We propose a cooperative model that
allows the operators to improve their utility in terms of revenue by sharing
their devices, and the devices to improve their payoff in terms of end-to-end
throughput by collaboratively performing multi-path routing. To help
understanding the interaction among operators and devices, we present a
game-theoretic framework to model the cooperation behavior, and further, we
propose a layered coalitional game (LCG) to address the decision making
problems among them. Specifically, the cooperation of operators is modeled as
an overlapping coalition formation game (CFG) in a partition form, in which
operators should form a stable coalitional structure. Moreover, the cooperation
of devices is modeled as a coalitional graphical game (CGG), in which devices
establish links among each other to form a stable network structure for
multi-path routing.We adopt the extended recursive core, and Nash network, as
the stability concept for the proposed CFG and CGG, respectively. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed LCG yields notable gains compared to both
the non-cooperative case and a LCG variant and achieves good convergence speed.

problem is a parallel to romantic decision making where an individual decides
when to be satisfied with a selection choice in the face of uncertain future
options. However, the secretary problem and its variations still do not provide
a practical solution in a world where individual preference, goals, and
societal context create a highly complex space of values that factor into
decision making. In light of these complexities, we offer a general process

dynamic non-cooperative bi-level model (i.e. Stackelberg leader-follower game)
to set parking prices in real-time for effective parking access and space
utilization. The model is expected to fit into an integrated parking pricing

facilitated by sensing and informatics infrastructures, that ensures the
availability of convenient spaces at equilibrium market prices. It is shown
with numerical examples that the proposed dynamic parking pricing model has the
potential to virtually eliminate vehicle circling for parking, which results in
significant reduction in adverse socioeconomic externalities such as traffic

information theory. The main part is a detailed report of the recent (partial)
solution of the quantum Gaussian optimizers problem which establishes an
optimal property of Glauber's coherent states -- a particular instance of pure
quantum Gaussian states. We elaborate on the notion of quantum Gaussian channel
as a noncommutative generalization of Gaussian kernel to show that the coherent
states, and under certain conditions only they, minimize a broad class of the
concave functionals of the output of a Gaussian channel. Thus, the output
states corresponding to the Gaussian input are ""the least chaotic"", majorizing
all the other outputs. The solution, however, is essentially restricted to the
gauge-invariant case where a distinguished complex structure plays a special
role. We also comment on the related famous additivity conjecture, which was
solved in principle in the negative some five years ago. This refers to the
additivity or multiplicativity (with respect to tensor products of channels) of
information quantities related to the classical capacity of quantum channel,
such as $(1\rightarrow p)$-norms or the minimal von Neumann or R\'enyi output
entropies. A remarkable corollary of the present solution of the quantum
Gaussian optimizers problem is that these additivity properties, while not
valid in general, do hold in the important and interesting class of the
gauge-covariant Gaussian channels.

gapped (or critical) effective (1+1)-dimensional theory whose criticality can
be accessed by the entanglement entropy $S$ of its ground state dubbed as

the same logarithmic law as that found in the critical 1D quantum chains, which
reads $S = (\kappa c/6)\log_2 D + const.$, with $c$ the central charge and
$\kappa$ a constant related to the scaling property of the correlation length

characterize the critical universality class of the original 2D systems. An
important implication of our work is that many well-established theories for 1D

studies of galactic dynamics and chemical evolution, but remains a dynamical
phenomenon that needs to be fully quantified. In this work, using a Tree-SPH
simulation of an Sb-type disc galaxy, we quantify the effects of blurring
(epicyclic excursions) and churning (change of guiding radius). We quantify
migration (either blurring or churning) both in terms of flux (the number of
migrators passing at a given radius), and by estimating the population of
migrators at a given radius at the end of the simulation compared to
non-migrators, but also by giving the distance over which the migration is
effective at all radii. We confirm that the corotation of the bar is the main
source of migrators by churning in a bar-dominated galaxy, its intensity being
directly linked to the episode of a strong bar, in the first 1-3 Gyr of the
simulation. We show that within the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR), migration
is strongly dominated by churning, while blurring gains progressively more
importance towards the outer disc and at later times. Most importantly, we show
that the OLR limits the exchange of angular momentum, separating the disc in
two distinct parts with minimal or null exchange, except in the transition
zone, which is delimited by the position of the OLR at the epoch of the
formation of the bar, and at the final epoch. We discuss the consequences of
these findings for our understanding of the structure of the Milky Way disc.
Because the Sun is situated slightly outside the OLR, we suggest that the solar
vicinity may have experienced very limited churning from the inner disc.

  Although $\mathbb{F}\langle x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n \rangle$ is not a unique
factorization ring, we note that variable-disjoint factorization in
$\mathbb{F}\langle x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n \rangle$ has the uniqueness property.
Furthermore, we prove that computing the variable-disjoint factorization is
polynomial-time equivalent to Polynomial Identity Testing (both when the input
polynomial is given by an arithmetic circuit or an algebraic branching
program). We also show that variable-disjoint factorization in the black-box
setting can be efficiently computed (where the factors computed will be also
given by black-boxes, analogous to the work [KT91] in the commutative setting).

noncommutative polynomials and multilinear noncommutative polynomials have
unique factorizations in the usual sense, which can be efficiently computed.
  Finally, we discuss a polynomial decomposition problem in $\mathbb{F}\langle

polynomial factorization and prove some complexity bounds for it.

a measure of the expected amount of information needed, to specify the state of
the system, beyond what is already known about the system from relationships
that appear as parameters. Under the requirement that the relationship
parameters minimise efe, the brain defines relationships. It is proposed that
when a brain state is interpreted in the context of these relationships the
brain state acquires meaning in the form of the relational content of the
associated experience. For a given set, the theory represents relationships
using weighted relations which assign continuous weights, from 0 to 1, to the
elements of the Cartesian product of that set. The relationship parameters
include weighted relations on the nodes of the system and on their set of

sensor in a network, where ambient RF transmitters are distributed as a Ginibre
?$\alpha$-determinantal point process (DPP), which becomes the Poisson point
process when $\alpha$? approaches zero. In the considered network, we focus on
analyzing the performance of a sensor equipped with the power-splitting
architecture. Under this architecture, we characterize the expected RF energy
harvesting rate of the sensor. Moreover, we derive the upper bound of both
power and transmission outage probabilities. Numerical results show that our
upper bounds are accurate for different value of ?$\alpha$.

effective scalar-tensor theory of on-brane gravity are discussed. In order to
avoid brane collisions and/or an infinite inter-brane distance, at finite
values of the brane coordinates, it is necessary that the radion scalar be
everywhere finite and non-zero. This requirement constrains the viability of
the standard, well-known solutions in General Relativity (GR), in the context
of the KS effective theory. The radion for the Schwarzschild solution does not
satisfy the above requirement. For the Reissner--Nordstrom (RN) naked
singularity and the extremal RN solution, one can obtain everywhere finite,
non-zero radion profiles, though the required on-brane matter violates the Weak
Energy Condition. In contrast, for the RN black hole, the radion profile yields
a divergent inter-brane distance at the horizon, which makes the solution
unphysical. Thus, both the Schwarzschild and the RN solutions can be meaningful
in the KS effective theory, only in the trivial GR limit, i.e. with a constant,
non-zero radion.

characterized by the thread of a small radius $\sim 0.6\times 10^{-11}$cm,
between two nuclei in a molecule. The main electron density is concentrated
outside the thread as in a covalent bond. The thread is formed by the electron
wave function which has a tendency to be singular on it. The singularity along
the thread is cut off by electron ""vibrations"" due to the interaction with zero
point electromagnetic oscillations. The electron energy has its typical value
of (1-10)eV. Due to the small tread radius the uncertainty of the electron
momentum inside the thread is large resulting in a large electron kinetic
energy $\sim 1 MeV$. This energy is compensated by formation of a potential
well due to the reduction of the energy of electromagnetic zero point
oscillations. This is similar to formation of a negative van der Waals
potential. Thread bonds are stable and cannot be created or destructed in
chemical or optical processes.
