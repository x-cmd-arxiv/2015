we found a very strong non-linear polarization-strain coupling that drives an
atypical amplification of the ferroelectric polarization for either compression

antiferromagnetic ordering, which induces a weak ferromagnetism and thus,
making the strained NaMnF3 fluoroperovskite multiferroic. We also calculate the
magnetoelectric response and we found it to be composed by linear and
non-linear components with amplitudes similar to the ones of Cr2O3. These
properties show that it is possible to move the fluoride family toward
functional applications with unique responses.

date, not to depend on metallicity, however, theoretical simulations have shown
that stars with subsolar metallicities may be favoured for harbouring smaller
planets. A large, dedicated survey of metal-poor stars with the HARPS
spectrograph has thus been carried out to search for Neptunes and super-Earths.
Aims. In this paper, we present the analysis of \object{HD175607}, an old G6
star with metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.62. We gathered 119 radial velocity
measurements in 110 nights over a time span of more than nine years. Methods.
The radial velocities were analysed using Lomb-Scargle periodograms, a genetic
algorithm, a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, and a Gaussian processes
analysis. The spectra were also used to derive stellar properties. Several
activity indicators were analysed to study the effect of stellar activity on
the radial velocities. Results. We find evidence for the presence of a small
Neptune-mass planet (M$_{p}\sin i = 8.98\pm1.10$\,M$_{\oplus}$) orbiting this
star with an orbital period $P = 29.01\pm0.02$\, days in a slightly eccentric
orbit ($e=0.11\pm0.08$). The period of this Neptune is close to the estimated
rotational period of the star. However, from a detailed analysis of the radial
velocities together with the stellar activity, we conclude that the best
explanation of the signal is indeed the presence of a planetary companion
rather than stellar related. An additional longer period signal ($P\sim
1400$\,d) is present in the data, for which more measurements are needed to
constrain its nature and its properties. Conclusions. HD\,175607 is the most
metal-poor FGK dwarf with a detected low-mass planet amongst the currently
known planet hosts. This discovery may thus have important consequences for
planet formation and evolution theories.

clustered population such as Cyg~OB2 the 90% completeness level is reached at
1.1 Msun instead, as the sources are more concentrated in areas of our survey

for a typical MHD disk wind solution with various values of disk accretion

them in terms of line shapes and intensities with the HIFI profiles observed by
the WISH Key Program. We find that a dusty MHD disk wind launched from 0.2--0.6
AU AU to 3--25 AU can reproduce to a remarkable degree the observed shapes and
intensities of the broad H2O component, both in the fundamental 557 GHz line
and in more excited lines. Such a model also readily reproduces the observed
correlation of 557 GHz line luminosity with envelope density, if the infall
rate at 1000 AU is 1--3 times the disk accretion rate in the wind ejection
region. It is also compatible with the typical disk size and bolometric
luminosity in the observed targets. However, the narrower line profiles in
Class 1 sources suggest that MHD disk winds in these sources, if present, would
have to be slower and/or less water rich than in Class 0 sources. In
conclusion, MHD disk winds appear as a valid (though not unique) option to
consider for the origin of the broad H2O component in low-mass protostars. ALMA
appears ideally suited to further test this model by searching for resolved
signatures of the warm and slow wide-angle molecular wind that would be

to a finite resolution so in their analysis there is generally an ignorance of
possible short-range phenomena. It is also well-known that the boundary
conditions of wavefunctions and fields can be used to model short-range
interactions when those interactions are expected, a priori. Here, a real-space
approach is described wherein an artificial boundary of ignorance is imposed to
explicitly exclude from analysis the region of a system wherein short-distance
effects may be obscure. The (artificial) boundary conditions encode those
short-distance effects by parameterizing the possible UV completions of the
wavefunction. Since measurable quantities, such as spectra and cross sections,
must be independent of the position of the artificial boundary, the boundary
conditions must evolve with the radius of the boundary in a particular way. As
examples of this approach, an analysis is performed of the non-relativistic
free particle, harmonic oscillator, and Coulomb potential, and some known
results for point-like (contact) interactions are recovered, however from a
novel perspective. Generically, observables differ from their canonical values
and symmetries are anomalously broken compared to those of idealized models.
Connections are made to well-studied physical systems, such as the binding of
light nuclei and cold atomic systems. This method is arguably more physically
transparent and mathematically easier to use than other techniques that require
the regularization and renormalization of delta-function potentials, and may
offer further generalizations of practical use.

correlation functions in which the lowest-lying eigenmodes of the Dirac
operator in quark propagators are removed by hand. The Banks-Casher relation
ties the chiral condensate to the density of low lying modes; thus, it is
plausible that removal of such modes could lead to a regime where spontaneous
chiral symmetry breaking does not occur. Surprising, a pattern of identical
correlation functions was observed that is larger than can be explained by a
restoration of chiral symmetry. This suggests that a larger symmetry---one that
is not present in the QCD lagrangian---emerges when these modes are removed.
Previously it was argued that this emergent symmetry was SU(4). However, when
the low-lying modes are removed, the correlation functions of sources in the
SU(4) 15-plet of spin-1 mesons appear to coincide with the correlation function
of the SU(4) singlet. A natural explanation for this is an emergent symmetry
larger than SU(4). In this work, it is shown that there exists no continuous
symmetry whose generators in the field theory are spatial integrals of local
operators that can account for the full pattern of identical correlation
functions unless the apparent coincidence of the singlet channel with the
15-plet is accidental.

their actions and the world they inhabit have first-person or intrinsic
meanings. The first-person or intrinsic meaning of an entity to a system is
defined as its relation with the system's goals and capabilities, given the
properties of the environment in which it operates. Therefore, for a system to
develop first-person meanings, it must see itself as a goal-directed actor,
facing limitations and opportunities dictated by its own capabilities, and by
the properties of the environment. The first part of the paper discusses this
claim in the context of arguments against and proposals addressing the
development of computer programs with first-person meanings. A set of
definitions is also presented, most importantly the concepts of cold and
phenomenal first-person meanings. The second part of the paper presents
preliminary proposals and achievements, resulting of actual software
implementations, within a research approach that aims to develop software
agents that intrinsically understand their actions and what happens to them. As
a result, an agent with no a priori notion of its goals and capabilities, and
of the properties of its environment acquires all these notions by observing
itself in action. The cold first-person meanings of the agent's actions and of
what happens to it are defined using these acquired notions. Although not
solving the full problem of first-person meanings, the proposed approach and
preliminary results allow us some confidence to address the problems yet to be
considered, in particular the phenomenal aspect of first-person meanings.

with a crucial clue to its formation history. H$_2$O has recently been detected
for the first time towards the prestellar core L1544 with the Herschel Space
Observatory with a high spectral resolution (HIFI instrument). Prestellar cores
provide the original reservoir of material from which future planetary systems
are built, but few observational constraints exist on the formation of water
and none on its deuteration before the collapse starts and a protostar forms at
the centre. We report on new APEX observations of the ground state
1$_{0,1}$-0$_{0,0}$ HDO transition at 464 GHz towards the prestellar core
L1544. The line is undetected, and we present an extensive study of the
conditions for its detectability in cold and dense cloud cores. The water and
deuterated water abundances have been estimated using an advanced chemical
model simplified for the limited number of reactions or processes that are
active in cold regions (< 15 K). We use the LIME radiative transfer code to
compute the expected intensity and profile of both H$_2$O and HDO lines and
compare them with the observations. We present several ad hoc profiles that
best-fit the observations and compare the profiles with results from an
astrochemical modelling, coupling gas phase and grain surface chemistry. Our
comparison between observations, radiative transfer, and chemical modelling
shows the limits of detectability for singly deuterated water, through the

phenomenon called antagonism. We characterize mathematically the generic

Then, based on basic biochemical rules, we establish that, surprisingly,
antagonism is a generic consequence of any strictly specific discrimination
made independently from ligand concentration. Thus antagonism constitutes a
""phenotypic spandrel"": a phenotype existing as a necessary by-product of
another phenotype. We exhibit a simple analytic model of discrimination
displaying antagonism, where antagonism strength is linear in distance from
detection threshold. This contrasts with traditional proofreading based models
where antagonism vanishes far from threshold and thus displays an inverted
hierarchy of antagonism compared to simpler models. The phenotypic spandrel
studied here is expected to structure many decision pathways such as immune
detection mediated by TCRs and FC$\epsilon$RIs, as well as endocrine
signalling/disruption.

solvent, each monomer has two neighbors bound by covalent bonds and also a
number of central-force contacts modelled by the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential.
We find that when the average number of contacts per monomer (covalent and
non-covalent) exceeds the critical value z*=4, the system becomes solid and the
dynamics arrested - a state that we declare the glass. Coarse-grained Brownian
dynamics simulations show that at sufficient strength of LJ attraction (which
effectively represents the depth of quenching, or the quality of solvent) the
polymer globule indeed crosses the threshold of z*=4, and does become a glass.
We verify this by showing the distinction between the `liquid' polymer droplet
at z<z*, which changes shape and adopts the spherical conformation in
equilibrium, and the `glassy' droplet at z>z*, which retains its shape frozen
at the moment of z* crossover. These results provide a robust working criterion

binary and measures the intersection of two oriented based curves on the
surface, while the second operation is unary and computes the self-intersection
of an oriented based curve. It is already known that Turaev's intersection

studied. The dissipation in such systems arises from two sources: inelasticity
in particle collisions and viscous dissipation due to the effect of the gas
phase on the particles. Here, we consider a simplified case in which the mean
relative velocity between the gas and solid phases is taken to be zero, such
that ""thermal drag"" is the only remaining gas-solid interaction. Unlike the
previous more general treatment of the drag force [Garz\'o \emph{et al.}, J.
Fluid Mech. \textbf{712}, 129 (2012)], here we take into account contributions
to the (scaled) transport coefficients $\eta^*$ (shear viscosity), $\kappa^*$
(thermal conductivity) and $\mu^*$ (Dufour-like coefficient) coming from the
temperature-dependence of the (dimensionless) friction coefficient $\gamma^*$
characterizing the amplitude of the drag force. At moderate densities, the
thermal drag model (which is based on the Enskog kinetic equation) is solved by
means of the Chapman-Enskog method and the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients
are determined in terms of the coefficient of restitution, the solid volume
fraction and the friction coefficient. The results indicate that the effect of
the gas phase on $\eta^*$ and $\mu^*$ is non-negligible (especially in the case
of relatively dilute systems) while the form of $\kappa^*$ is the same as the
one obtained in the dry granular limit. Finally, as an application of these
results, a linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic equations is carried
out to analyze the conditions for stability of the homogeneous cooling state. A
comparison with direct numerical simulations shows a good agreement for
conditions of practical interest.

power supply and demand are balanced. In emergency situations, the operators
proceed to cut a suitable amount of loads to rebalance the supply-demand and
hopefully stabilize the system. This traditional emergency control scheme
results in interrupted service with severely economic damages to customers. In
order to provide seamless electricity service to customers, this paper proposes
a viable alternative for traditional remedial controls of power grids by
exploiting the plentiful transmission facilities. In particular, we consider
two emergency control schemes involving adjustment of the susceptance of a
number of selected transmission lines to drive either fault-on dynamics or
post-fault dynamics, and thereby stabilize the system under emergency
situations. The corresponding emergency control problems will be formulated and
partly solved in some specific cases. Simple numerical simulation will be used

  accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile users' correlated mobility and data consumption patterns often lead to
severe cellular network congestion in peak hours and hot spots. This paper
presents an optimal design of time and location aware mobile data pricing,
which incentivizes users to smooth traffic and reduce network congestion. We
derive the optimal pricing scheme through analyzing a two-stage decision
process, where the operator determines the time and location aware prices by
minimizing his total cost in Stage I, and each mobile user schedules his mobile
traffic by maximizing his payoff (i.e., utility minus payment) in Stage II. We
formulate the two-stage decision problem as a bilevel optimization problem, and
propose a derivative-free algorithm to solve the problem for any increasing
concave user utility functions. We further develop low complexity algorithms
for the commonly used logarithmic and linear utility functions. The optimal
pricing scheme ensures a win-win situation for the operator and users.
Simulations show that the operator can reduce the cost by up to 97.52% in the
logarithmic utility case and 98.70% in the linear utility case, and users can
increase their payoff by up to 79.69% and 106.10% for the two types of
utilities, respectively, comparing with a time and location independent pricing
benchmark. Our study suggests that the operator should provide price discounts
at less crowded time slots and locations, and the discounts need to be
significant when the operator's cost of provisioning excessive traffic is high
or users' willingness to delay traffic is low.

seemingly universal network structures. The widely-studied model of
preferential attachment assumes that new nodes are more likely to connect to
highly connected nodes. Preferential attachment explains the emergence of
scale-free degree distributions within complex networks. Yet, it is
incompatible with many network systems, particularly bipartite systems in which
two distinct types of agents interact. For example, the addition of new links
in a host-parasite system corresponds to the infection of hosts by parasites.
Increasing connectivity is beneficial to a parasite and detrimental to a host.
Therefore, the overall network connectivity is subject to conflicting
pressures. Here, we propose a stochastic network growth model of conflicting
attachment, inspired by a particular kind of parasite-host interactions: that
of viruses interacting with microbial hosts. The mechanism of network growth
includes conflicting preferences to network density as well as costs involved
in modifying the network connectivity according to these preferences. We find
that the resulting networks exhibit realistic patterns commonly observed in
empirical data, including the emergence of nestedness, modularity, and
nested-modular structures that exhibit both properties. We study the role of
conflicting interests in shaping network structure and assess opportunities to
incorporate greater realism in linking growth process to pattern in systems
governed by antagonistic and mutualistic interactions.

covariance matrix of the model is approximated by a block-diagonal matrix. The
structure of this matrix is detected by thresholding the sample covariance
matrix, where the threshold is selected using the slope heuristic. Based on the
block-diagonal structure of the covariance matrix, the estimation problem is
divided into several independent problems: subsequently, the network of
dependencies between variables is inferred using the graphical lasso algorithm
in each block. The performance of the procedure is illustrated on simulated

objectively focused on interactions among smaller subsets of genes, leading to
a more parsimonious and interpretable modular network.

open. Throughout this work, we pay special attention to the different

provide a physical understanding of the object in terms of the forces acting
upon it and its long term motion as response to those forces. Direct and
explicit estimation of the forces and the motion of objects from a single image
is extremely challenging. We define intermediate physical abstractions called
Newtonian scenarios and introduce Newtonian Neural Network ($N^3$) that learns
to map a single image to a state in a Newtonian scenario. Our experimental
evaluations show that our method can reliably predict dynamics of a query
object from a single image. In addition, our approach can provide physical
reasoning that supports the predicted dynamics in terms of velocity and force
vectors. To spur research in this direction we compiled Visual Newtonian
Dynamics (VIND) dataset that includes 6806 videos aligned with Newtonian
scenarios represented using game engines, and 4516 still images with their

in a variety of novel non-dissipative transport phenomena in systems with

Magnetic Effect (CME) -- the generation of electric current along an external
magnetic field induced by chirality imbalance. Because the chirality imbalance
is related to the global topology of gauge fields, the CME current is
topologically protected and hence non-dissipative even in the presence of
strong interactions. As a result, the CME and related quantum phenomena affect
the hydrodynamical and transport behavior of strongly coupled quark-gluon
plasma, and can be studied in relativistic heavy ion collisions where strong
magnetic fields are created by the colliding ions. Evidence for the CME and
related phenomena has been reported by the STAR Collaboration at Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider at BNL, and by the ALICE Collaboration at the Large Hadron

The blind estimation of the fullband reverberation time (RT) by

approach. An improvement of this algorithm is devised where an energy-weighted
averaging of the upper subband RT estimates is performed using either a DCT or
1/3-octave filter-bank. The evaluation results show that this approach leads to
a lower variance for the estimation error in comparison to the baseline
approach at the price of an increased computational complexity. Moreover, a new
algorithm to estimate the subband RT is devised, where the RT estimates for the
lower octave subbands are extrapolated from the RT estimates of the upper
subbands by means of a simple model for the frequency-dependency of the subband
RT. The evaluation results of the ACE challenge reveal that this approach
allows to estimate the subband RT with an estimation error which is in a

Poisson binomial distribution (PBD) of order $n$ is the discrete probability
distribution of the sum of $n$ mutually independent Bernoulli random variables.
Given $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples from an unknown PBD $\mathbf{p}$,
our algorithm runs in time $(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log (1/\epsilon))}$, and
outputs a hypothesis PBD that is $\epsilon$-close to $\mathbf{p}$ in total
variation distance. The previously best known running time for properly
learning PBDs was $(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$.
  As one of our main contributions, we provide a novel structural
characterization of PBDs. We prove that, for all $\epsilon >0,$ there exists an
explicit collection $\cal{M}$ of $(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log (1/\epsilon))}$
vectors of multiplicities, such that for any PBD $\mathbf{p}$ there exists a
PBD $\mathbf{q}$ with $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ distinct parameters whose
multiplicities are given by some element of ${\cal M}$, such that $\mathbf{q}$
is $\epsilon$-close to $\mathbf{p}$. Our proof combines tools from Fourier
analysis and algebraic geometry.
  Our approach to the proper learning problem is as follows: Starting with an
accurate non-proper hypothesis, we fit a PBD to this hypothesis. More
specifically, we essentially start with the hypothesis computed by the
computationally efficient non-proper learning algorithm in our recent
work~\cite{DKS15}. Our aforementioned structural characterization allows us to
reduce the corresponding fitting problem to a collection of
$(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log(1/\epsilon))}$ systems of low-degree polynomial

$(1/\epsilon)^{O(\log \log(1/\epsilon))}$, which yields the overall running

  [...] After this the notion of `weak' Kan extension within an augmented

Tel B allows us to revise its properties: spectral type M7+/-1, Teff=2700+/-100
K, log(g)<4.5 dex, log(L/L_Sun)=-2.51+/-0.10 dex, and mass 38-72 MJ. The 1-3.8
mic SED of HD 1160 B suggests a massive brown dwarf or a low-mass star with
spectral type M5.5-7.0, Teff=3000+/-100 K, [M/H]=-0.5-0.0 dex,
log(L/L_Sun)=-2.81+/-0.10 dex, and mass 39-168 MJ. We confirm the deceleration
and high eccentricity (e>0.66) of PZ Tel B. For e<0.9, the inclination,
longitude of the ascending node, and time of periastron passage are well
constrained. The system is seen close to an edge-on geometry. We reject other
brown dwarf candidates outside 0.25"" for both systems, and massive giant
planets (>4 MJ) outside 0.5"" for the PZ Tel system. We also show that K1-K2
color can be used with YJH low-resolution spectra to identify young L-type
companions, provided high photometric accuracy (<0.05 mag) is achieved.
Conclusions. SPHERE opens new horizons in the study of young brown dwarfs and
giant exoplanets thanks to high-contrast imaging capabilities at optical and
near-infrared wavelengths, as well as high signal-to-noise spectroscopy in the
near-infrared from low (R~30-50) to medium resolutions (R~350).

metal-rich (M/H = +0.2 dex) main-sequence star (G9V) that was discovered with
Subaru/HiCIAO in 2009. From previous studies, it has drawn attention as being
the coldest (~600K) companion ever directly imaged around a neighboring star.
We present new high-contrast data obtained during the commissioning of the
SPHERE instrument at the VLT. The data was obtained in Y-, J-, H-, and Ks-bands
with the dual-band imaging (DBI) mode of IRDIS, providing a broad coverage of
the full near-infrared (near-IR) range at higher contrast and better spectral
sampling than previously reported. In this new set of high-quality data, we
report the re-detection of the companion, as well as the first detection of a
new candidate closer-in to the star. We use the new 8 photometric points for an
extended comparison of GJ758 B with empirical objects and 4 families of
atmospheric models. From comparison to empirical object, we estimate a T8
spectral type, but none of the comparison object can accurately represent the
observed near-IR fluxes of GJ758 B. From comparison to atmospheric models, we
attribute a Teff = 600K $\pm$ 100K, but we find that no atmospheric model can
adequately fit all the fluxes of GJ758 B. The photometry of the new candidate
companion is broadly consistent with L-type objects, but a second epoch with
improved photometry is necessary to clarify its status. The new astrometry of
GJ758 B shows a significant proper motion since the last epoch. We use this
result to improve the determination of the orbital characteristics using two
fitting approaches, Least-Square Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of our data to additional closer-in
companions and reject the possibility of other massive brown dwarf companions
down to 4-5 AU. [abridged]

contribution from corners in the entangling surface in 2+1d. It is
characterized by a universal function $a(\theta)$ depending on the opening
angle $\theta$, and contains pertinent low energy information. For conformal
field theories (CFTs), the leading expansion coefficient in the smooth limit
$\theta \to \pi$ yields the stress tensor 2-point function coefficient $C_T$ .
Little is known about $a(\theta)$ beyond that limit. Here, we show that the
next term in the smooth limit expansion contains information beyond the 2- and
3-point correlators of the stress tensor. We conjecture that it encodes 4-point
data, making it much richer. Further, we establish strong constraints on this

lower-bounded by a non-trivial function multiplied by the central charge $C_T$
, e.g. $a(\pi/2) \geq (\pi^2 \ln 2)C_T /6$. This bound for 90-degree corners is
nearly saturated by all known results, including recent numerics for the
interacting Wilson-Fisher quantum critical points (QCPs). A bound is also given
for the R\'enyi entropies. We illustrate our findings using O(N) QCPs, free
boson and Dirac fermion CFTs, strongly coupled holographic ones, and other
models. Exact results are also given for Lifshitz quantum critical points, and
for conical singularities in 3+1d.

in the early Universe via non-equilibrium processes, and would therefore
possess a highly non-thermal spectrum of primordial velocities. In this paper
we analyse the process of structure formation with this class of dark matter
particles. To this end we construct primordial dark matter power spectra as a
function of the lepton asymmetry, $L_6$, that is present in the primordial
plasma and leads to resonant sterile neutrino production. We compare these
power spectra with those of thermally produced dark matter particles and show
that resonantly produced sterile neutrinos are much colder than their thermal
relic counterparts. We also demonstrate that the shape of these power spectra
is not determined by the free-streaming scale alone. We then use the power
spectra as an input for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in order to
predict the number of luminous satellite galaxies in a Milky Way-like halo. By
assuming that the mass of the Milky Way halo must be no more than
$2\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$ (the adopted upper bound based on current
astronomical observations) we are able to constrain the value of $L_6$ for
$M_s\le 8$~keV. We also show that the range of $L_6$ that is in best agreement
with the 3.5~keV line (if produced by decays of 7~keV sterile neutrino)
requires that the Milky Way halo has a mass no smaller than
$1.5\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$. Finally, we compare the power spectra obtained by
direct integration of the Boltzmann equations for a non-resonantly produced
sterile neutrino with the fitting formula of Viel~et~al. and find that the
latter significantly underestimates the power amplitude on scales relevant to
satellite galaxies.

ISM conditions that compare only with the most obscured, compact starbursts and
AGN in the local Universe today. The spatially resolved [CII] line is
strikingly uniform and very broad, 500-600 km/s wide, extending throughout the
entire galaxy over about 2.5 kpc, with modest shear. Such a large, homogeneous
velocity dispersion indicates a highly turbulent medium. W2246-0526 is unstable
in terms of the energy and momentum that are being injected into the ISM,
strongly suggesting that the gas is being blown away from the system

synthesis to identify Faraday complex polarized sources --- i.e. objects whose
frequency-dependent polarization behaviour indicates the presence of material
possessing complicated magnetoionic structure along the line of sight (LOS).
For sources classified as Faraday complex, we have analyzed a number of their
radio and multiwavelength properties to determine whether they differ from
Faraday simple polarized sources (i.e. sources for which LOS magnetoionic
structures are comparatively simple) in these properties. We use this
information to constrain the physical nature of the magnetoionic structures
responsible for generating the observed complexity. We detect Faraday
complexity in 12\% of polarized sources at $\sim1'$ resolution, but demonstrate
that underlying signal-to-noise limitations mean the true percentage is likely
to be significantly higher in the polarized radio source population. We find
that the properties of Faraday complex objects are diverse, but that complexity
is most often associated with depolarization of extended radio sources
possessing a relatively steep total intensity spectrum. We find an association
between Faraday complexity and LOS structure in the Galactic interstellar
medium (ISM), and claim that a significant proportion of the Faraday complexity
we observe may be generated at interfaces of the ISM associated with ionization
fronts near neutral hydrogen structures. Galaxy clusters environments and
internally generated Faraday complexity provide possible alternative
explanations in some cases.

relatively heavy mass of the discovered Higgs boson and the null results of new

Scherk-Schwarz mechanism, is possible to accommodate such situations. A
concrete example, the Compact Supersymmetry model, has a compressed spectrum
ameliorating the LHC bounds and large mixing in the top and scalar top quark
sector with $|A_t|\sim 2m_{\tilde{t}}$ which radiatively raises the Higgs mass.
While the zero mode contribution of the model has been considered, in this
paper we calculate the Kaluza-Klein tower effect to the Higgs mass. Although
such contributions are naively expected to be as small as a percent level for
10 TeV Kaluza-Klein modes, we find the effect significantly enhances the
radiative correction to the Higgs quartic coupling by from 10 to 50 %. This is
mainly because the top quark wave function is pushed out from the brane, which
makes the top mass depend on higher powers in the Higgs field. As a result the
Higgs mass is enhanced up to 15 GeV from the previous calculation. We also show
the whole parameter space is testable at the LHC run II.

the physics and chemistry at play in the atmospheres of self-luminous young
(~30 Myr) planets. We recently obtained new photometry of the four planets and
low-resolution (R~30) spectra of HR8799 d and e with the SPHERE instrument
(paper III). In this paper (paper IV), we compare the available spectra and
photometry of the planets to known objects and atmospheric models (BT-SETTL14,
Cloud-AE60, Exo-REM) to characterize the atmospheric properties of the planets.
We find that HR8799d and e properties are well reproduced by those of L6-L8
dusty dwarfs discovered in the field, among which some are candidate members of
young nearby associations. No known object reproduces well the properties of
planets b and c. Nevertheless, we find that the spectra and WISE photometry of
peculiar and/or young early-T dwarfs reddened by submicron grains made of
corundum, iron, enstatite, or forsterite successfully reproduce the SED of
these two planets. Our analysis confirms that only the Exo-REM models with
thick clouds fit (within 2{\sigma}) the whole set of spectrophotometric
datapoints available for HR8799 d and e for Teff = 1200 K, log g in the range
3.0-4.5, and M/H=+0.5. The models still fail to reproduce the SED of HR8799c

degenerate. We conclude that an enhanced content in dust and decreased CIA of
H2 is certainly responsible for the deviation of the properties of the planet
with respect to field dwarfs. The analysis suggests in addition that HR8799c
and b have later spectral types than the two other planets, and therefore could
both have lower masses.

incorrect, which can render the results of the calculation unreliable or
meaningless. We discuss how to identify the infinite variance problem. An
approach is then proposed to solve the problem. The solution does not require
major modifications to standard algorithms, adding a ``bridge link"" to the
imaginary-time path-integral. The general idea is applicable to a variety of
situations where the infinite variance problem may be present. Illustrative
results are presented for the ground state of the Hubbard model at
half-filling.

branch phase of stellar evolution. They have periods of up to ~1000d and
amplitudes that can exceed a factor of three in the I-band flux. These stars
pulsate predominantly in their fundamental mode, which is a function of mass
and radius, and so the pulsation periods are sensitive to the age of the
underlying stellar population. The overall number of long period variables in a
population is directly related to their lifetime, which is difficult to predict
from first principles because of uncertainties associated with stellar
mass-loss and convective mixing. The time variability of these stars has not
been previously taken into account when modeling the spectral energy
distributions of galaxies. Here we construct time-dependent stellar population
models that include the effects of long period variable stars, and report the
ubiquitous detection of this expected `pixel shimmer' in the massive metal-rich
galaxy M87. The pixel light curves display a variety of behaviors, including
linearly rising and falling curves, semi-periodic curves, and sudden increases
or decreases in the flux level. The observed variation of 0.1-1% is very well
matched to the predictions of our models. The data provide a strong and novel
constraint on the properties of variable stars in an old and metal-rich stellar
population, and we infer that the lifetime of long period variables in M87 is
shorter by approximately 30% compared to predictions from the latest stellar
evolution models.

parameters (temperature, surface gravity, [M/H], and [alpha/M]). Due to the
smaller uncertainties in surface gravity possible with high-resolution spectra
and accurate Hipparcos distance measurements, we are able to calculate the
stellar masses to within 40%. For red giants, the relatively rapid evolution of
stars up the red giant branch allows the age to be constrained based on the
mass. We examine methods of estimating age using both the mass-age relation
directly and a Bayesian isochrone matching of measured parameters, assuming a
constant star formation history (SFH). To improve the prior on the SFH, we use
a hierarchical modeling approach to constrain the parameters of a model SFH
from the age probability distribution functions of the data. The results of an
alpha dependent Gaussian SFH model shows a clear relation between age and
[alpha/M] at all ages. Using this SFH model as the prior for an empirical
Bayesian analysis, we construct a full age probability distribution function
and determine ages for individual stars. The age-metallicity relation is flat,
with a slight decrease in [M/H] at the oldest ages and a ~ 0.5 dex spread in
metallicity. For stars with ages < 1 Gyr we find a smaller spread, consistent
with radial migration having a smaller effect on these young stars than on the

able to resolve the structure of bulges for the first time. Hence, we review
the current state of bulge formation in cosmological simulations, and discuss
open questions that can be addressed in the near future by simulators, with a
particular focus on merger-driven bulge growth. Galaxy mergers have long been
assumed to produce classical bulges in disk galaxies. Under this
bulge-formation model, though, the high rates of mergers in Cold Dark Matter
galaxy formation theory predict many more classical bulges than are observed.
Furthermore, simulations of galaxy formation continue to generally produce too
massive of bulges. Feedback offers a promising avenue for reducing
merger-driven bulge growth by maintaining high gas fractions in galaxies and
ejecting low-angular momentum gas driven to the centers of galaxies. After
reviewing the results of relevant research that has been published to date, we
use cosmological simulations to explore the ability of feedback to reduce or
even prevent bulge growth during mergers. In dwarf galaxies, mergers actually
reduce the central concentration of galaxies as the induced burst of star
formation drives out low angular momentum material. This result shows the
potential for feedback to reduce central mass growth. However, we also
demonstrate that it is very difficult for current stellar feedback models to
reproduce the small bulges observed in more massive disk galaxies like the
Milky Way. We argue that feedback models need to be improved, or an additional
source of feedback such as AGN is necessary to generate the required outflows.

always greater than market bid price, and these prices move upwards and
downwards due to new arrivals, market trades, and cancellations. We model these
two price processes as ""bouncing geometric Brownian motions (GBMs)"", which are
defined as exponentials of two mutually reflected Brownian motions. We then
modify these bouncing GBMs to construct a discrete time stochastic process of
trading times and trading prices, which is parameterized by a positive
parameter $\delta$. Under this model, it is shown that the inter-trading times
are inverse Gaussian distributed, and the logarithmic returns between
consecutive trading times follow a normal inverse Gaussian distribution. Our
main results show that the logarithmic trading price process is a renewal
reward process, and under a suitable scaling, this process converges to a
standard Brownian motion as $\delta\to 0$. We also prove that the modified ask
and bid processes approach the original bouncing GBMs as $\delta\to0$. Finally,
we derive a simple and effective prediction formula for trading prices, and
illustrate the effectiveness of the prediction formula with an example using
real stock price data.

optimization strategy inspired by both of the developmental trajectory of
children's visual object recognition capabilities, and Bar (2003), who
hypothesized that basic level information is carried in the fast magnocellular
pathway through the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and then projected back to inferior
temporal cortex (IT), where subordinate level categorization is achieved. We
instantiate this idea by training a deep CNN to perform basic level object
categorization first, and then train it on subordinate level categorization. We
apply this idea to training AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) on the ILSVRC
2012 dataset and show that the top-5 accuracy increases from 80.13% to 82.14%,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the method. We also show that subsequent
transfer learning on smaller datasets gives superior results.

first is a local effect: out-of-equilibrium, thermally-activated magnons in the
ferromagnet, driven by a spin Seebeck effect, exert a torque on the
magnetization via magnon-magnon scattering with coherent dynamics. The second
is a nonlocal effect which requires an additional magnetic layer to provide the
symmetry breaking necessary to realize a thermal torque. The simplest structure
in which to induce a nonlocal thermal torque is a spin valve composed of two
insulating magnets separated by a normal metal spacer; there, a thermal flux
generates a pure spin current through the spin valve, which results in a torque
when the magnetizations of the layers are misaligned.

the inner disk of transition disks. Inside the snow line, the lack of ice
mantles in dust particles decreases the sticking efficiency between grains. As
a consequence, particles fragment at lower collision velocities than in regions
beyond the snow line. This effect allows small particles to be maintained for
up to a few Myrs within the first astronomical unit. These particles are
closely coupled to the gas and do not drift significantly with respect to the
gas. For lower mass planets (1$M_{\rm{Jup}}$), the pre-transition appearance
can be maintained even longer because dust still trickles through the gap
created by the planet, moves invisibly and quickly in the form of relatively
large grains through the gap, and becomes visible again as it fragments and
gets slowed down inside of the snow line. The global study of dust evolution of
a disk with an embedded planet, including the changes of the dust aerodynamics
near the snow line, can explain the concentration of millimetre-sized particles
in the outer disk and the survival of the dust in the inner disk if a large
dust trap is present in the outer disk. This behaviour solves the conundrum of
the combination of both near-infrared excess and ring-like millimetre emission
observed in several transition disks.

can place on $Z'$ bosons coming from gauged muon number minus tau number,
$L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$. As the $L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$ gauge boson does not couple to
proton constituents or electrons at tree level, the current bounds are fairly
loose, especially for $M_{Z'} \gtrsim 1\, \rm GeV$. For $2m_{\mu} < M_{Z'} <
M_Z/2$ we develop search strategies using the $pp \rightarrow Z \to 4\, \mu$
channel. The cleanliness of the final state, combined with the fact that $pp
\to Z \to 4 e$, $Z \to 2e\,2\mu$ can be used as background control samples,
allow us to spot $L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$ $Z'$ with couplings $\mathcal O(10^{-3})$
times the Standard Model couplings. For lighter $Z'$, we propose the mode $pp
\rightarrow 2\mu + \displaystyle{\not} E_T$. The presence of missing energy
means there is a wider set of backgrounds to consider in this final state, such
as Drell-Yan production of leptonically decaying $\tau$ pairs, however we find
these can be controlled with careful cuts. Combining the $4\, \mu$ and $2\,\mu

that it links data mined from many different software artifacts to obtain

throughout the different phases of the software lifecycle. Since SA is
currently a hot and promising topic, we have conducted a systematic literature
review, presented in this paper, to identify gaps in knowledge and open
research areas in SA. Because many researchers are still confused about the
true potential of SA, we had to filter out available research papers to obtain
the most SA-relevant work for our review. This filtration yielded 19 studies
out of 135. We have based our systematic review on four main factors: which
software practitioners SA targets, which domains are covered by SA, which
artifacts are extracted by SA, and whether these artifacts are linked or not.
The results of our review have shown that much of the available SA research
only serves the needs of developers. Also, much of the available research uses
only one artifact which, in turn, means fewer links between artifacts and fewer
insights. This shows that the available SA research work is still embryonic
leaving plenty of room for future research in the SA field.

surfaces such as wind turbine blades within Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). In
the ALM the lift and drag forces are replaced by an imposed body force which is
typically smoothed over several grid points using a Gaussian kernel with some
prescribed smoothing width $\epsilon$. To date, the choice of $\epsilon$ has
most often been based on numerical considerations related to the grid spacing
used in LES. However, especially for finely resolved LES with grid spacings on
the order of or smaller than the chord-length of the blade, the best choice of
$\epsilon$ is not known. In this work, a theoretical approach is followed to
determine the most suitable value of $\epsilon$. Firstly, we develop an
analytical solution to the linearized flow response to a Gaussian lift and drag
force and use the results to establish a relationship between the local and
far-field velocity required to specify lift and drag forces. Then, focusing
first on the lift force, we find $\epsilon$ and the force center location that
minimize the square difference between the velocity fields induced by the
Gaussian force and 2D potential flow over Joukowski airfoils. We find that the
optimal smoothing width $\epsilon^{\rm opt}$ is on the order of 14-25\% of the
chord length of the blade, and the center of force is located at about 13-26\%
downstream of the leading edge of the blade, for the cases considered. These
optimal values do not depend on angle of attack and depend only weakly on the
type of lifting surface. To represent the drag force, the optimal width of the
circular Gaussian drag force field is shown to be equal to the momentum
thickness of the wake.

orbits around a dwarf galaxy that either falls into the Milky Way or evaporates
as it orbits the Milky Way. We find that the dynamical evolution of a star
cluster is determined by whichever galaxy has the strongest tidal field at the
position of the cluster. Thus, clusters entering the Milky Way undergo changes
in size as the Milky Way tidal field becomes stronger and that of the dwarf
diminishes. We find that ultimately accreted clusters quickly become the same
size as a cluster born in the Milky Way on the same orbit. Assuming their
initial sizes are similar, clusters born in the Galaxy and those that are

admissible experimental probability distributions is fully characterized as the
convex hull of 24 distributions: 8 Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) boxes and 16 local
deterministic distributions. Here, we refine this result to show that in the
(2,2,2) case, any nonlocal nonsignaling distribution can always be uniquely
expressed as a convex combination of exactly one PR box and (up to) eight local

occur only with a fixed set of eight local deterministic distributions with

demonstrate an analytical proof that the minimum detection efficiency for which
nonlocality can be observed is $\eta>2/3$ even for theories constrained only by
the no-signaling principle, and we develop new algorithms that speed the
calculation of important statistical functions of Bell test data. Finally, we
enumerate the vertices of the no-signaling polytope for the (2, n, 2) ""chained

direction lead to anisotropic flows of final hadrons through collective
expansion in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Fluctuations along the
longitudinal direction, on the other hand, can result in decorrelation of
anisotropic flows in different regions of pseudo rapidity ($\eta$).
Decorrelation of the $2$nd and $3$rd order anisotropic flows with different
$\eta$ gaps for final charged hadrons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is
studied in an event-by-event (3+1)D ideal hydrodynamic model with fully
fluctuating initial conditions from A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model. The
decorrelation of anisotropic flows of final hadrons with large $\eta$ gaps are
found to originate from the spatial decorrelation along the longitudinal
direction in the AMPT initial conditions through hydrodynamic evolution. The
decorrelation is found to consist of both a linear twist and random fluctuation
of the event-plane angles. The agreement between our results and recent CMS
data in most centralities suggests that the string-like mechanism of initial
parton production in AMPT model captures the initial longitudinal fluctuation
that is responsible for the measured decorrelation of anisotropic flows in
Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. Our predictions for Au+Au collisions at the highest
RHIC energy show stronger longitudinal decorrelation, indicating larger
longitudinal fluctuations at lower beam energies. Our study also calls into

flows and extraction of transport coefficients through comparisons to
hydrodynamic simulations that do not include longitudinal fluctuations.

there is growing interest in using online data to study and quantify phenomena
in the offline ""real"" world. As social media data can be obtained in near
real-time and at low cost, it is often used for ""now-casting"" indices such as
levels of flu activity or unemployment. The term ""social sensing"" is often used
in this context to describe the idea that users act as ""sensors"", publicly
reporting their health status or job losses. Sensor activity during a time
period is then typically aggregated in a ""one tweet, one vote"" fashion by
simply counting. At the same time, researchers readily admit that social media
users are not a perfect representation of the actual population. Additionally,
users differ in the amount of details of their personal lives that they reveal.
Intuitively, it should be possible to improve now-casting by assigning
different weights to different user groups.
  In this paper, we ask ""How does social sensing actually work?"" or, more
precisely, ""Whom should we sense--and whom not--for optimal results?"". We
investigate how different sampling strategies affect the performance of
now-casting of two common offline indices: flu activity and unemployment rate.
We show that now-casting can be improved by 1) applying user filtering
techniques and 2) selecting users with complete profiles. We also find that,
using the right type of user groups, now-casting performance does not degrade,
even when drastically reducing the size of the dataset. More fundamentally, we
describe which type of users contribute most to the accuracy by asking if
""babblers are better"". We conclude the paper by providing guidance on how to
select better user groups for more accurate now-casting.

the next decade through precision timing of millisecond pulsars. Removal of
frequency-dependent interstellar medium (ISM) delays due to dispersion and
scattering is a key issue in the detection process. Current timing algorithms
routinely correct pulse times of arrival (TOAs) for time-variable delays due to
cold plasma dispersion. However, none of the major pulsar timing groups correct
for delays due to scattering from multi-path propagation in the ISM. Scattering
introduces a frequency-dependent phase change in the signal that results in
pulse broadening and arrival time delays. Any method to correct the TOA for
interstellar propagation effects must be based on multi-frequency measurements
that can effectively separate dispersion and scattering delay terms from
frequency-independent perturbations such as those due to a gravitational wave.
Cyclic spectroscopy, first described in an astronomical context by Demorest
(2011), is a potentially powerful tool to assist in this multi-frequency
decomposition. As a step toward a more comprehensive ISM propagation delay
correction, we demonstrate through a simulation that we can accurately recover
impulse response functions (IRFs), such as those that would be introduced by
multi-path scattering, with a realistic signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate
that timing precision is improved when scatter-corrected TOAs are used, under
the assumptions of a high signal-to-noise and highly scattered signal. We also
show that the effect of pulse-to-pulse ""jitter"" is not a serious problem for
IRF reconstruction, at least for jitter levels comparable to those observed in

similarly between the LMC and Galactic samples, but the LMC sources seem to
require a slightly higher H2O ice threshold for the appearance of the 3.47
micron band. For the LMC sources with relatively large H2O ice optical depths,
we found that the strength ratio of the 3.47 micron band relative to the water
ice band is only marginally lower than those of the Galactic sources. We
propose that grain surface reactions at a relatively high dust temperature
(warm ice chemistry) are responsible for the observed characteristics of ice
chemical compositions in the LMC. We suggest that this warm ice chemistry is
one of the important characteristics of interstellar and circumstellar
chemistry in low metallicity environments. The low abundance of CH3OH in the
solid phase implies that formation of complex organic molecules from
methanol-derived species is less efficient in the LMC. For the 3.47 micron
band, the observed difference in the water ice threshold may suggest that a
more shielded environment is necessary for the formation of the 3.47 micron
band carrier in the LMC.

contextual and temporal features of the post. For instance, the contents of the

a unified framework to tackle the post prioritization problem. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach for prioritizing posts based on a feature modulated
multi-dimensional point process. Our model is able to simultaneously capture
textual and sentiment features, and temporal features such as self-excitation,
mutual-excitation and bursty nature of social interaction. As an evaluation, we
also curated a real-world conversational benchmark dataset crawled from

Nebulous Clusters program (IN-SYNC) survey of the Orion A molecular cloud. This
survey obtained high resolution near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of about 2700
young pre-main sequence stars throughout the region, acquired across five
distinct fields spanning 6deg field of view (FOV). With these spectra, we have
measured accurate stellar parameters (T_eff, log g, v sin i) and extinctions,
and placed the sources in the Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram (HRD). We have also
extracted radial velocities for the kinematic characterization of the
population. We compare our measurements with literature results for a
sub-sample of targets in order to assess the performances and accuracy of the
survey. Source extinction shows evidence for dust grains that are larger than
those in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM): we estimate an average R_V=5.5
in the region. Importantly, we find a clear correlation between HRD inferred
ages and spectroscopic surface-gravity inferred ages. This clearly indicates a
real spread of stellar radii at fixed temperature, and together with additional
correlations with extinction and with disk presence, strongly suggests a real
spread of ages large than a few Myr. Focussing on the young population around
NGC1980 iota Ori, which has previously been suggested to be a separate,
foreground, older cluster, we confirm its older (5Myr) age and low A_V, but
considering that its radial velocity distribution is indistinguishable from the
Orion A's population, we suggest that NGC1980 is part of Orion A's star
formation activity. Based on their stellar parameters and kinematic properties,
we identify 383 new candidate members of Orion A, most of which are diskless
sources in areas of the region poorly studied by previous works.

decodes neural activity of the user into movements of an end effector, such as
a cursor or robotic arm. In practice, the decoder is often learned by updating
its parameters while the user performs a task. When the user's intention is not
directly observable, recent methods have demonstrated value in training the
decoder against a surrogate for the user's intended movement. We describe how
training a decoder in this way is a novel variant of an imitation learning
problem, where an oracle or expert is employed for supervised training in lieu
of direct observations, which are not available. Specifically, we describe how
a generic imitation learning meta-algorithm, dataset aggregation (DAgger, [1]),
can be adapted to train a generic brain-computer interface. By deriving
existing learning algorithms for brain-computer interfaces in this framework,
we provide a novel analysis of regret (an important metric of learning
efficacy) for brain-computer interfaces. This analysis allows us to
characterize the space of algorithmic variants and bounds on their regret
rates. Existing approaches for decoder learning have been performed in the
cursor control setting, but the available design principles for these decoders
are such that it has been impossible to scale them to naturalistic settings.
Leveraging our findings, we then offer an algorithm that combines imitation
learning with optimal control, which should allow for training of arbitrary
effectors for which optimal control can generate goal-oriented control. We
demonstrate this novel and general BCI algorithm with simulated neuroprosthetic
control of a 26 degree-of-freedom model of an arm, a sophisticated and

flares''), yet it is still unclear which processes contribute to the emission.
To understand the transport of energy needed to account for this emission, we
must first identify both the emission processes and the emission source
regions. Possibilities include heating in the chromosphere causing optically
thin or thick emission from free-bound transitions of Hydrogen, and heating of
the photosphere causing enhanced H$^-$ continuum brightness. To investigate
these possibilities, we combine observations from IRIS, SDO/HMI, and the
ground-based FIRS instrument, covering wavelengths in the far-UV, near-UV,
visible, and infrared during the X1 flare SOL20140329T17:48. Fits of blackbody
spectra to infrared and visible wavelengths are reasonable, yielding radiation
temperatures $\sim$6000-6300 K. The NUV emission, formed in the upper
photosphere under undisturbed conditions, exceeds these simple fits during the
flare, requiring extra emission from the Balmer continuum in the chromosphere.
Thus, the continuum originates from enhanced radiation from photosphere
(visible-IR) and chromosphere (NUV). From the standard thick-target flare
model, we calculate the energy of the nonthermal electrons observed by RHESSI
and compare it to the energy radiated by the continuum emission. We find that
the energy contained in most electrons $>$40 keV, or alternatively, of
$\sim$10-20% of electrons $>$20 keV is sufficient to explain the extra
continuum emission of $\sim4-8 \times 10^{10}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. Also,
from the timing of the RHESSI HXR and the IRIS observations, we conclude that
the NUV continuum is emitted nearly instantaneously when HXR emission is

nonparametric heterogeneous treatment effect framework when a binary treatment
is mismeasured and endogenous. Using a binary instrumental variable, I
characterize the sharp identified set for the local average treatment effect
under the exclusion restriction of an instrument and the deterministic
monotonicity of the true treatment in the instrument. Even allowing for general
measurement error (e.g., the measurement error is endogenous), it is still
possible to obtain finite bounds on the local average treatment effect.
Notably, the Wald estimand is an upper bound on the local average treatment
effect, but it is not the sharp bound in general. I also provide a confidence
interval for the local average treatment effect with uniformly asymptotically
valid size control. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the identification strategy
of this paper offers a new use of repeated measurements for tightening the

make a contribution to this issue by investigating superfluid density response
function in celebrated Kondo-Heisenberg model. To be specific, we derive
corresponding formalism from an effective fermionic large-N mean-field pairing
Hamiltonian, whose pairing interaction is assumed to originate from effective
local antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. Interestingly, it is found that
physically correct superfluid density formula can only be obtained if external
electromagnetic field is directly coupled to heavy fermion quasi-particle. Such

experimental measurement in heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_{5}$ and
Yb-doped Ce$_{1-x}$Yb$_{x}$CoIn$_{5}$, where the agreement is fairly good and
the transition of pairing symmetry in the latter one is explained as a simple

developed.

series of works. They can be clearly separated by [alpha\Fe] and several other
elemental abundance ratios including [Cu/Fe]. Very recently, a non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) study revealed that relatively large
departures exist between LTE and non-LTE results in copper abundance analysis.
We aim to derive the copper abundances for the stars from the sample of Nissen
et al (2010) with both LTE and non-LTE calculations. Based on our results, we
study the non-LTE effects of copper and investigate whether the high-alpha
population can still be distinguished from the low-alpha population in the
non-LTE [Cu/Fe] results. Our differential abundance ratios are derived from the
high-resolution spectra collected from VLT/UVES and NOT/FIES spectrographs.
Applying the MAFAGS opacity sampling atmospheric models and spectrum synthesis
method, we derive the non-LTE copper abundances based on the new atomic model
with current atomic data obtained from both laboratory and theoretical
calculations. The copper abundances determined from non-LTE calculations are
increased by 0.01 to 0.2 dex depending on the stellar parameters compared with
the LTE results. The non-LTE [Cu/Fe] trend is much flatter than the LTE one in
the metallicity range -1.6<[Fe/H]<-0.8. Taking non-LTE effects into
consideration, the high- and low-alpha stars still show distinguishable copper
abundances, which appear even more clear in a diagram of non-LTE [Cu/Fe] versus
[Fe/H]. The non-LTE effects are strong for copper, especially in metal-poor
stars. Our results confirmed that there are two distinct halo populations in
the solar neighborhood. The dichotomy in copper abundance is a peculiar feature
of each population, suggesting that they formed in different environments and
evolved obeying diverse scenarios.

shown that two-component ISDs are apportioned into regions or plateaux within

found to be robust outcomes of one type of non-equilibrium growth, which
indicates the usefulness of the two-component ISD in predicting outcomes of
some types of far-from-equilibrium growth. However, little is known as to how

displays classes of structures that are morphologically distinct, little is
known about the source of these distinct morphologies. This article outlines an

Additionally, the analytical framework allows for the characterization of local

33-39% of the X-ray background in the 8-24 keV band, directly identifying AGN
with obscuring columns up to approximately 1e25 /cm2. In the softer 3-8 keV
band the number counts are in general agreement with those measured by
XMM-Newton and Chandra over the flux range 5e-15 < S(3 - 8 keV)/(erg/cm2/s) <
1e-12 probed by NuSTAR. In the hard 8-24 keV band NuSTAR probes fluxes over the

fainter than previous measurements. The 8-24 keV number counts match
predictions from AGN population synthesis models, directly confirming the
existence of a population of obscured and/or hard X-ray sources inferred from
the shape of the integrated cosmic X-ray background. The measured NuSTAR counts
lie significantly above simple extrapolation with a Euclidian slope to low flux
of the Swift/BAT 15-55 keV number counts measured at higher fluxes S(15-55 keV)

Swift/BAT local (z<0.1) sample and NuSTAR's z~1 sample. CXB synthesis models,
which account for AGN evolution, lie above the Swift/BAT measurements,
suggesting that they do not fully capture the evolution of obscured AGN at low

evolution of the AGN population seen in prior, lower-energy studies of the XLF.
However, different models of the intrinsic distribution of absorption, which
are used to correct for selection biases, give significantly different
predictions for the total number of sources in our sample, leading to small,
systematic differences in our binned estimates of the XLF. Adopting a model
with a lower intrinsic fraction of Compton-thick sources and a larger
population of sources with column densities N_H ~ 10^{23-24} /cm2 or a model
with stronger Compton reflection component (with a relative normalization of R
~ 2 at all luminosities) can bring extrapolations of the XLF from 2-10 keV into
agreement with our NuSTAR sample. Ultimately, X-ray spectral analysis of the
NuSTAR sources is required to break this degeneracy between the distribution of
absorbing column densities and the strength of the Compton reflection component
and thus refine our measurements of the XLF. Furthermore, the models that
successfully describe the high-redshift population seen by NuSTAR tend to
over-predict previous, high-energy measurements of the local XLF, indicating
that there is evolution of the AGN population that is not fully captured by the

sensitivity limits of ~1.3 x 10^-14 erg/cm2/s (3-8 keV), ~3.4 x 10^-14

ratios of the twelve sources that are detected in both bands span the range
0.39-1.7, corresponding to a photon index range of Gamma ~ 0.5-2.3, with a

as a physical fluctuation is determined by the 6x6 matrix defining the

component or step in several pattern recognition and image processing tasks.
Although a variety of powerful saliency models have been intensively proposed,
they usually involve heavy feature (or model) engineering based on priors (or
assumptions) about the properties of objects and backgrounds. Inspired by the
effectiveness of recently developed feature learning, we provide a novel Deep
Image Saliency Computing (DISC) framework for fine-grained image saliency
computing. In particular, we model the image saliency from both the coarse- and
fine-level observations, and utilize the deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) to learn the saliency representation in a progressive manner.
Specifically, our saliency model is built upon two stacked CNNs. The first CNN
generates a coarse-level saliency map by taking the overall image as the input,
roughly identifying saliency regions in the global context. Furthermore, we
integrate superpixel-based local context information in the first CNN to refine
the coarse-level saliency map. Guided by the coarse saliency map, the second
CNN focuses on the local context to produce fine-grained and accurate saliency
map while preserving object details. For a testing image, the two CNNs
collaboratively conduct the saliency computing in one shot. Our DISC framework
is capable of uniformly highlighting the objects-of-interest from complex
background while preserving well object details. Extensive experiments on
several standard benchmarks suggest that DISC outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods and it also generalizes well across datasets without
additional training. The executable version of DISC is available online:

player for each qubit, as in a graph state. Here we consider the case of
testing many maximally entangled pairs of qubits shared between two players.
Previously such a test was shown where testing is sequential, i.e., one pair is
tested at a time. Here we consider the parallel case where all pairs are tested
simultaneously, giving considerably more power to dishonest players. We derive
sufficient conditions for a self-test for many maximally entangled pairs of

classical periodic orbits, in two-dimensional quantum wells perturbed by local

require the existence of short, moderately unstable periodic orbits in the
perturbed system. Instead, they are supported by classical resonances in the
unperturbed system and the resulting quantum near-degeneracy. Even in the case
of a large number of randomly scattered impurities, the scars prefer distinct
orientations that extremize the overlap with the impurities. We demonstrate
that these preferred orientations can be used for highly efficient transport of
quantum wave packets across the perturbed potential landscape. Assisted by the
scars, wave-packet recurrences are significantly stronger than in the
unperturbed system. Together with the controllability of the preferred
orientations, this property may be very useful for quantum transport
applications.

In two experiments, we investigated how the selective attenuation of spatial
frequencies in the central or the peripheral visual field affects eye-movement
behavior during real-world scene viewing. Gaze-contingent low-pass or high-pass
filters with varying filter levels (i.e., cutoff frequencies; Experiment 1) or
filter sizes (Experiment 2) were applied. Compared to unfiltered control
conditions, mean fixation durations increased most with central high-pass and
peripheral low-pass filtering. Increasing filter size prolonged fixation
durations with peripheral filtering, but not with central filtering. Increasing
filter level prolonged fixation durations with low-pass filtering, but not with
high-pass filtering. These effects indicate that fixation durations are not
always longer under conditions of increased processing difficulty. Saccade
amplitudes largely adapted to processing difficulty: amplitudes increased with
central filtering and decreased with peripheral filtering; the effects
strengthened with increasing filter size and filter level. In addition, we
observed a trade-off between saccade timing and saccadic selection, since
saccade amplitudes were modulated when fixation durations were unaffected by
the experimental manipulations. We conclude that interactions of perception and
gaze control are highly sensitive to experimental manipulations of input images
as long as the residual information can still be accessed for gaze control.

are based on the well-established offline-analysis code CLISTE, following the
classical concept of iteratively solving the Grad-Shafranov equation and
feeding in diagnostic signals from the experiment. The new code adopts a hybrid
parallelization scheme for computing the equilibrium flux distribution and
extends the fast, shared-memory-parallel Poisson solver which we have described

open-source software components and runs on standard server hardware and

performing an offline-computation of a sequence of 1000 flux distributions
which are taken from one second of operation of a typical AUG discharge and
deriving the relevant control parameters with a time resolution of a
millisecond. On current server hardware the new code allows employing a grid
size of 32x64 zones for the spatial discretization and up to 15 basis

with Ly\alpha\ in the GLASS spectra. Based on the distribution of
signal-to-noise ratios and on simulations we expect the completeness and the
purity of the sample to be 40-100% and 60-90%, respectively. For the objects
without detected emission lines we show that the observed (not corrected for
lensing magnification) 1$\sigma$ flux limits reaches
$5\times10^{-18}$erg/s/cm$^{2}$ per position angle over the full wavelength
range of GLASS (0.8-1.7$\mu$m). Based on the conditional probability of
Ly\alpha\ emission measured from the ground at $z\sim7$ we would have expected
12-18 Ly\alpha\ emitters. This is consistent with the number of detections,
within the uncertainties, confirming the drop in Ly\alpha\ emission with
respect to $z\sim6$. These candidates include a promising source at $z=8.1$.
The spatial extent of Ly\alpha\ in a deep stack of the most convincing
Ly\alpha\ emitters with $\langle z\rangle=7.2$ is consistent with that of the
rest-frame UV continuum. Extended Ly$\alpha$ emission, if present, has a
surface brightness below our detection limit, consistent with the properties of
lower redshift comparison samples. From the stack we estimate upper limits on
rest-frame UV emission line ratios and find $f_\textrm{CIV} /
f_\textrm{Ly${\alpha}$} \lesssim 0.32$ and $f_\textrm{CIII]} /
f_\textrm{Ly$\alpha$} \lesssim 0.23$ in good agreement with other values

that a non-standard aggregation of risk measures is possible via
weighted-dilated infimal convolution. We analyze the impact of the problem's
parameters on the pricing mechanism, in particular how the agents' performance
concern rates affect prices and risk perceptions. In extreme situations, we
find that the concern rates destroy the equilibrium while the risk measures
themselves remain stable.

Computation of the location estimate of is fundamental in data analysis, and it
is well known in statistics that classical methods, such as taking the sample
average, can be greatly affected by the presence of outliers in the data. Using
the median instead of the mean can partially resolve this issue but not
completely. For the univariate case, a robust version of the median is the
Least Trimmed Absolute Deviation (LTAD) robust estimator introduced
in~\cite{Tableman1994}, which has desirable asymptotic properties such as
robustness, consistently, high breakdown and normality. There are different
generalizations of the LTAD for multivariate data, depending on the choice of
norm. In~\cite{ChaPitZiou:2015} we present such a generalization using the
Euclidean norm and propose a solution technique for the resulting combinatorial
optimization problem, based on a necessary condition, that results in a highly
convergent local search algorithm. In this subsequent work we use the $L^1$
norm to generalize the LTAD to higher dimensions, and show that the resulting
mixed integer programming problem has an integral relaxation, after applying an
appropriate data transformation. Moreover, we utilize the structure of the
problem to show that the resulting LP's can be solved efficiently using a
subgradient optimization approach. The robust statistical properties of the
proposed estimator are verified by extensive computational results.

  We give a complete characterization of a plane domain $U$ with smooth

one-dimensional manifold of class $C^1$ without boundary) that is uniquely
determined in the class of domains in $\mathbb R^2$ with smooth boundaries by

If $U$ is bounded then the convexity of $U$ is a necessary and sufficient

determination in the class of all plane domains with smooth boundaries by the

equivalent to its strict convexity.
  In the last section, we consider the case of space domains.
  We prove a theorem on the unique determination of a strictly convex domain in

the Goldstone mode of the BCS gap is directly visible in the dynamics of the

response of a confined Fermi gas to a rapid change of the scattering length

density-matrix approach within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism that includes
a 3D harmonic confinement we simulate and identify the emergence of the
Goldstone mode in a cigar-shaped $^6$Li gas. We show that the quench leads to a
low-frequency in-phase oscillation of the single-particle occupations. Complete
inversion is achieved for occupations corresponding to the lowest-lying
single-particle states.

constructed by training a one-class support vector machine with a Gaussian

with a Gaussian mixture model. We leverage the representation's sparse
parametrisation and robustness to noise, outliers and occlusions in an
efficient registration algorithm that minimises the L2 distance between our
support vector--parametrised Gaussian mixtures. In contrast, existing
techniques, such as Iterative Closest Point and Gaussian mixture approaches,
manifest a narrower region of convergence and are less robust to occlusions and
missing data, as demonstrated in the evaluation on a range of 2D and 3D
datasets. Finally, we present a novel algorithm, GMMerge, that parsimoniously
and equitably merges aligned mixture models, allowing the framework to be used

additive error model, the phase error model is more suitable for capturing the
uncertainty in an LOS channel, as the dominant source of uncertainty lies in
the phase. We consider a multiple-input single-output (MISO) multicast
scenario, in which our goal is to design a beamformer that minimizes the
transmit power while satisfying probabilistic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
constraints. The probabilistic constraints give rise to a new computational
challenge, as they involve random trigonometric forms. In this work, we propose
to first approximate the random trigonometric form by its second-order Taylor
expansion and then tackle the resulting random quadratic form using a
Bernstein-type inequality. The advantage of such an approach is that an
approximately optimal beamformer can be obtained using the standard
semidefinite relaxation technique. In the simulations, we first show that if a
non-robust design (i.e., one that does not take phase errors into account) is
used, then the whole system may collapse. We then show that our proposed method
is less conservative than the existing robust design based on Gaussian
approximation and thus requires a lower power budget.

$t$-channel exchanges of mesonic Regge trajectories. The onset of the Regge

single-meson exchanges and full-fledged Regge-trajectory exchanges. Gauge
invariance broken by the Regge treatment is fully restored by introducing
contact-type interaction currents that result from the implementation of
\textit{local} gauge invariance in terms of generalized Ward-Takahashi
identities. The cross sections for the $\gamma n\to K^+\Sigma^*(1385)^-$

approach provides a good description of the main features of the data. However,
the parameters fitted to the data show that the gauge-invariance-restoring

The field is first propagated in the image half space from the camera to the
afocal image of the MO optimal plane (plane for which MO has been designed) by
using a quadratic kernel. The field is then propagated from the MO optimal
plane to the object with the exact kernel. Calibration of the reconstruction is
made by imaging a calibrated object like an USAF resolution target for
different positions along $z$. Once the calibration is done, the reconstruction

derive general theorems on these Fourier expansions. Specifically, we give
complete proofs of the Langlands constant term formula for Eisenstein series on
adelic groups G(A) as well as the Casselman--Shalika formula for the p-adic

L-functions. Somewhat surprisingly, all these results have natural

scrutinized recently because of a variety of exotic properties unprecedented

the origin of the interaction that causes the nematic transition at $T_s=90\,K$
without accompanying magnetic order. Elucidating the nature of spin excitations
in the normal state is a key to addressing this issue. Here we report, from
inelastic neutron-scattering measurements in FeSe single crystals, that
high-energy spin excitation spectra of FeSe exhibit characteristic energy
dependence with missing intensity at around 70-80$\,$meV, which are very
different from other iron-based superconductors. Despite of the strongest
electron correlations among the iron-based superconductor family, the spectra
are qualitatively at variance with the local moment model and can be
essentially described by the itinerant electron picture. Moreover, the
dynamical spin susceptibility above $T_s$ is only weakly temperature dependent,
which is in stark contrast to the Curie-Weiss behavior of the electronic
nematic susceptibility, suggesting that the nematic transition is not likely
driven by spin but by orbital degrees of freedom.

cities and its understanding has broad societal implications. Despite an
abundant literature, many issues remain unclear. In particular, all definitions
of segregation are implicitely tied to a single indicator, usually rely on an
ambiguous definition of income classes, without any consensus on how to define
neighbourhoods and to deal with the polycentric organization of large cities.
In this paper, we address all these questions within a unique conceptual
framework. We avoid the challenge of providing a direct definition of
segregation and instead start from a definition of what segregation is not.
This naturally leads to the measure of representation that is able to identify
locations where categories are over- or underrepresented. From there, we
provide a new measure of exposure that discriminates between situations where
categories co-locate or repel one another. We then use this feature to provide
an unambiguous, parameter-free method to find meaningful breaks in the income
distribution, thus defining classes. Applied to the 2014 American Community
Survey, we find 3 emerging classes -- low, middle and higher income -- out of
the original 16 income categories. The higher-income households are
proportionally more present in larger cities, while lower-income households are
not, invalidating the idea of an increased social polarisation. Finally, using
the density -- and not the distance to a center which is meaningless in
polycentric cities -- we find that the richer class is overrepresented in high
density zones, especially for larger cities. This suggests that density is a
relevant factor for understanding the income structure of cities and might
explain some of the differences observed between US and European cities.

  beats of Chlamydomonas flagella",,,,,"physics.bio-ph q-bio.CB q-bio.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Axonemal dyneins are the molecular motors responsible for the beating of
cilia and flagella. These motors generate sliding forces between adjacent
microtubule doublets within the axoneme, the motile cytoskeletal structure
inside the flagellum. To create regular, oscillatory beating patterns, the
activities of the axonemal dyneins must be coordinated both spatially and
temporally. It is thought that coordination is mediated by stresses or strains
that build up within the moving axoneme, but it is not known which components
of stress or strain are involved, nor how they feed back on the dyneins. To
answer this question, we used isolated, reactivate axonemes of the unicellular
alga Chlamydomonas as a model system. We derived a theory for beat regulation
in a two-dimensional model of the axoneme. We then tested the theory by
measuring the beat waveforms of wild type axonemes, which have asymmetric
beats, and mutant axonemes, in which the beat is nearly symmetric, using
high-precision spatial and temporal imaging. We found that regulation by
sliding forces fails to account for the measured beat, due to the short lengths
of Chlamydomonas cilia. We found that regulation by normal forces (which tend
to separate adjacent doublets) cannot satisfactorily account for the symmetric
waveforms of the mbo2 mutants. This is due to the model's failure to produce
reciprocal inhibition across the axes of the symmetrically beating axonemes.
Finally, we show that regulation by curvature accords with the measurements.
Unexpectedly, we found that the phase of the curvature feedback indicates that
the dyneins are regulated by the dynamic (i.e. time-varying) component of
axonemal curvature, but not by the static one. We conclude that a high-pass
filtered curvature signal is a good candidate for the signal that feeds back to
coordinate motor activity in the axoneme.

capture data, i.e., positions of labeled markers attached to the human body.
Tracking in noisy data can be effectively performed with the aid of
well-established recursive state estimation techniques. This allows us to
systematically take noise of the marker measurements into account. However, as
joint limits imposed by the human body have to be satisfied during estimation,
first we transform this constrained estimation problem into an unconstrained
one by using periodic functions. Then, we apply the Smart Sampling Kalman
Filter to solve this unconstrained estimation problem. The proposed recursive
state estimation approach makes the human motion tracking very robust to
partial occlusion of markers and avoids any special treatment or reconstruction
of the missed markers. A concrete implementation built on the kinematic human
reference model of the Master Motor Map framework and a Vicon motion capture
system is evaluated. Different captured motions show that our implementation
can accurately estimate whole-body human motion in real-time and outperforms

understanding their properties and performance. Using first-principles
calculations, we study the effects of uniaxial strain on the Raman-active modes
in monolayer MoS$_2$. We show that the in-plane $E'$ mode at 384 cm$^{-1}$ and
the out-of-plane $A_1'$ mode at 403 cm$^{-1}$ can serve as fingerprints for the
uniaxial strain in this 2D material. Specifically, under a uniaxial strain, the
doubly degenerate $E'$ mode splits into two non-degenerate modes: one is
$E_{\parallel}'$ mode in which atoms vibrate in parallel to the strain
direction, and the other is $E_\perp'$ mode in which atoms vibrate
perpendicular to the strain direction. The frequency of the $E_{\parallel}'$
mode blue-shifts for a compressive strain, but red-shifts for a tensile strain.
In addition, due to the strain-induced anisotropy in the MoS$_2$ lattice, the
polarized Raman spectra of the $E_{\parallel}'$ and $E_{\perp}'$ modes exhibit
distinct angular dependence for specific laser polarization setups, allowing
for a precise determination of the direction of the uniaxial strain with
respect to the crystallographic orientation. Furthermore, we find that the
polarized Raman intensity of the $A_1'$ mode also shows evident dependence on
the applied strain, providing additional effective clues for determining the
direction of the strain even without knowledge of the crystallographic
orientation. Thus, polarized Raman spectroscopy offers an efficient
non-destructive way to characterize the uniaxial strains in monolayer MoS$_2$.

lead to a notion of phantom extensions for general modules, and we will prove
that all modules that are phantom extensions can be modified into balanced big

solid algebras can be modified into balanced big Cohen-Macaulay modules.
(Hochster and Huneke have previously demonstrated that there exist solid

concept of an L-function.
  The most famous L-function is the Riemann zeta-function, and as well as being
ubiquitous in number theory itself, L-functions have applications in
mathematical physics and cryptography. Two of the seven Clay Mathematics
Million Dollar Millennium Problems, the Riemann Hypothesis and the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, deal with their properties. Many different
mathematical objects are connected in various ways to L-functions, but the
study of those objects is highly specialized, and most mathematicians have only
a vague idea of the objects outside their specialty and how everything is
related. Helping mathematicians to understand these connections was the
motivation for the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB) project. Its
mission is to chart the landscape of L-functions and modular forms in a
systematic, comprehensive and concrete fashion. This involves developing their
theory, creating and improving algorithms for computing and classifying them,
and hence discovering new properties of these functions, and testing
fundamental conjectures.
  In the lecture I gave a very brief introduction to L-functions for
non-experts, and explained and demonstrated how the large collection of data in
the LMFDB is organized and displayed, showing the interrelations between linked
objects, through our website www.lmfdb.org. I also showed how this has been

from its equilibrium state. The related energy density variation is set up
analytically, whereas its volume integration is carried out numerically. This
facilitates the consideration of more realistic neutron star characteristics
within the model compared to analytical treatments. At the same time, our
method retains the possibility to yield general information about neutron star
magnetic field and composition structures that are likely to be stable. In
contrast to numerical studies, classes of parametrized systems can be studied
at once, finally constraining realistic configurations for interior neutron
star magnetic fields. We apply the stability analysis scheme on polytropic and
non-barotropic neutron stars with toroidal, poloidal and mixed fields testing
their stability in a Newtonian framework. Furthermore, we provide the
analytical scheme for dropping the Cowling approximation in an axisymmetric
system and investigate its impact. Our results confirm the instability of
simple magnetised neutron star models as well as a stabilisation tendency in
the case of mixed fields and stratification. These findings agree with
analytical studies whose spectrum of model systems we extend by lifting former

confined to the first quadrant is governed by similar equations, and has led in
the past decade to a rich collection of attractive results dealing with the
nature (algebraic, D-finite or not) of the associated generating function,
depending on the set of allowed steps. We first adapt Tutte's approach to prove
(or reprove) the algebraicity of all quadrant models known or conjectured to be
algebraic (with one small exception). This includes Gessel's famous model, and
the first proof ever found for one model with weighted steps. To be applicable,
the method requires the existence of two rational functions called invariant
and decoupling function respectively. When they exist, algebraicity comes out
(almost) automatically. Then, we move to an analytic viewpoint which has
already proved very powerful, leading in particular to integral expressions of
the generating function in the non-D-finite cases, as well as to proofs of
non-D-finiteness. We develop in this context a weaker notion of invariant. Now
all quadrant models have invariants, and for those that have in addition a

Delaunay TrIangulation Void findEr) based on Delaunay Triangulation (DT), which
efficiently computes the empty spheres constrained by a discrete set of
tracers. We define the spheres as DT voids, and describe their properties,
including an universal density profile together with an intrinsic scatter. We
apply this technique on 100 halo catalogues with volumes of 2.5\,$h^{-1}$Gpc
side each, with a bias and number density similar to the BOSS CMASS Luminous
Red Galaxies, performed with the \textsc{patchy} code. Our results show that
there are two main species of DT voids, which can be characterised by the
radius: they have different responses to halo redshift space distortions, to
number density of tracers, and reside in different dark matter environments.
Based on dynamical arguments using the tidal field tensor, we demonstrate that
large DT voids are hosted in expanding regions, whereas the haloes used to
construct them reside in collapsing ones. Our approach is therefore able to
efficiently determine the troughs of the density field from galaxy surveys, and
can be used to study their clustering. We further study the power spectra of DT
voids, and find that the bias of the two populations are different,
demonstrating that the small DT voids are essentially tracers of groups of
haloes.

recent experimental results of the ionization yield from 6.7 keV nuclear
recoils in LAr. The statistical distribution of the number of electrons that
escape recombination is found to deviate from the binomial distribution, and
estimates of recombination fluctuations for nuclear recoils tracks are
obtained. A study of the recombination kinetics shows that a significant part
of electrons undergo very fast static recombination, an effect that may be
responsible for the weak drift-field dependence of the ionization yield from
nuclear recoils in some noble liquids. The obtained results can be useful in
the search for hypothetical dark matter particles and in other studies that
involve detection of recoiled nuclei.

(SINR) model of interference. We evaluate two recent coloring algorithms,
Rand4DColor and ColorReduction (in the following ColorRed), proposed by Fuchs
and Prutkin in [SIROCCO'15], the MW-Coloring algorithm introduced by Moscibroda
and Wattenhofer [DC'08] and transferred to the SINR model by Derbel and Talbi
[ICDCS'10], and a variant of the coloring algorithm of Yu et al. [TCS'14]. We
additionally consider several practical improvements to the algorithms and
evaluate their performance in both static and dynamic scenarios. Our
experiments show that Rand4DColor is very fast, computing a valid
(4Degree)-coloring in less than one third of the time slots required for local
broadcasting, where Degree is the maximum node degree in the network. Regarding
other O(Degree)-coloring algorithms Rand4DColor is at least 4 to 5 times
faster. Additionally, the algorithm is robust even in networks with mobile
nodes and an additional listening phase at the start of the algorithm makes
Rand4DColor robust against the late wake-up of large parts of the network.
Regarding (Degree+1)-coloring algorithms, we observe that ColorRed it is
significantly faster than the considered variant of the Yu et al. coloring
algorithm, which is the only other (Degree+1)-coloring algorithm for the SINR
model. Further improvement can be made with an error-correcting variant that
increases the runtime by allowing some uncertainty in the communication and
afterwards correcting the introduced conflicts.

the indispensability of general relativity in our understanding of these
fascinating objects. In Newtonian gravity the pressure within a star merely
plays the role of opposing self-gravity. In general relativity all sources of
energy and momentum contribute to the gravity. As a result the pressure not
only opposes gravity but also enhances it. The later role of pressure becomes
more pronounced with increasing compactness, $M/R$ where $M$ and $R$ are the
mass and radius of the star, and sets a critical mass beyond which collapse is
inevitable. This critical mass has no Newtonian analogue; it is conceptually
different than the Stoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit in Newtonian gravity which
is attained asymptotically for ultra-relativistic fermions. For white dwarfs
the general relativistic critical mass is very close to the
Stoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit. For neutron stars the maximum mass---so
called Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit---is significantly smaller than the
Stoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit. This follows from the fact that the general
relativistic correction to hydrostatic equilibrium within a neutron star is
significant throughout the star, including the central part where the mass
contained within radial coordinate, $m(r)$, and the Newtonian gravitational
acceleration, $Gm(r)/r^2$, are small.

features from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings using deep learning
techniques. EEG data are generally only available in small quantities, they are
high-dimensional with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, and there is considerable
variability between individual subjects and recording sessions. Our proposed
techniques specifically address these challenges for feature learning.
Cross-trial encoding forces auto-encoders to focus on features that are stable
across trials. Similarity-constraint encoders learn features that allow to
distinguish between classes by demanding that two trials from the same class
are more similar to each other than to trials from other classes. This
tuple-based training approach is especially suitable for small datasets.
Hydra-nets allow for separate processing pathways adapting to subsets of a
dataset and thus combine the advantages of individual feature learning (better
adaptation of early, low-level processing) with group model training (better
generalization of higher-level processing in deeper layers). This way, models
can, for instance, adapt to each subject individually to compensate for
differences in spatial patterns due to anatomical differences or variance in
electrode positions. The different techniques are evaluated using the publicly
available OpenMIIR dataset of EEG recordings taken while participants listened
to and imagined music.

wavelengths. Molecular gas has been found in the halo at a distance of ~20 kpc
from the galaxy centre, associated with HI shells. The molecular gas lies
inside some IR and UV bright star-forming filaments that have recently been
observed in the direction of the radio jets. These archival data show that
there is dust and very weak star formation on scales of hundreds of parsecs.
  On top of analysing combined archival data, we have performed searches of
HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) emission with ATCA at the interaction of the northern
filaments and the HI shell of Cen A. Measuring the dense gas is another
indicator of star formation efficiency inside the filaments. However, we only
derived upper limits of 1.6x10^3 K.km/s.pc^2 at 3 sigma in the synthesised beam
of 3.1"".
  We also compared the CO masses with the SFR estimates in order to measure a
star formation efficiency. Using a standard conversion factor leads to long
depletion times (7 Gyr). We then corrected the mass estimates from metallicity
effect by using gas-to-dust mass ratio as a proxy. From MUSE data, we estimated
the metallicity spread (0.4-0.8 Zsun) in the filament, corresponding to
gas-to-dust ratios of ~200-400. The CO/H2 conversion ratio is corrected for low
metallicity by a factor between 1.4 and 3.2. Such a low-metallicity correction
leads to even more massive clouds with higher depletion times (16 Gyr). We
finally present ALMA observations that detect 3 unresolved CO(2-1) clumps of
size <37x21 pc and masses around 10^4 Msun. The velocity width of the CO
emission line is ~10 km/s, leading to a rather high virial parameter. This is a
hint of a turbulent gas probably powered by kinetic energy injection from the
AGN jet/wind and leading to molecular gas reservoir not forming star
efficiently.

(via the 4.44 MeV 12C 2+ state) 2+ x d_5/2 paths are included in a coupled

calculating the probability rate for a dynamical black hole gives a measure of

pillars of modern physics. As such, there should be no remaining doubt
regarding its validity. However, finite-size scaling, which derives from it,
has long been poorly understood above the upper critical dimension $d_c$ in
models with free boundary conditions. Besides its fundamental significance for
scaling theories, the issue is important at a practical level because
finite-size, statistical-physics systems, with free boundaries above $d_c$, are
experimentally accessible with long-range interactions. Here we address the
roles played by Fourier modes for such systems and show that the current
phenomenological picture is not supported for all thermodynamic observables
either with free or periodic boundaries. Instead, the correct picture emerges
from a sector of the renormalization group hitherto considered unphysical.

  arXiv:1501.00504",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a model that expands Godyak's collisional sheath model to
the case of hot electrodes (anode or cathode) with thermionic electron
emission. In the model, the electrodes are assumed to be made from refractory
metals and, consequently, the erosion of the electrodes is small and can be
neglected. In the frame of two temperature thermal plasma modeling, this model
allows self-consistent calculation of the sheath potential drop, the Schottky
correction factor for the work function of the wall material, the thermionic
electron current density, and the heat fluxes of the charged particles from the
plasma to the wall. The model is applied to the cathode spot at the tungsten
cathode in argon. It is shown that the Shottky correction factor plays a
crucial role in modeling high-intensity arcs. It is demonstrated that a virtual
cathode can be formed in the atmospheric pressure argon plasma at the cathode
surface temperature of 4785 K if the cathode current density is sufficiently
small. The heat flux to the thermionic cathode due to charged particles and the
heat flux to the plasma due to thermionic electrons are calculated. The model
can be reduced to the case of cold walls where the thermionic electron emission
and the wall erosion processes are small and can be neglected. The sheath
potential drop and the heat fluxes calculated by this model can be used as
boundary conditions at the wall for the electric potential and for the energy
equations for the electrons and heavy particles (ions and neutrals).

is studied for a compliance cost functional in the context of the optimization

mechanically simple, parametrized microscopic supporting structure is chosen
and the parameters describing the structure are determined minimizing the
compliance objective. An a posteriori error estimate is derived which includes
the modeling error caused by the replacement of a nested laminate
microstructure by this considerably simpler microstructure. Indeed, nested
laminates are known to realize the minimal compliance and provide a benchmark
for the quality of the microstructures. To estimate the local difference in the
compliance functional the dual weighted residual approach is used. Different
numerical experiments show that the resulting adaptive scheme leads to simple
parametrized microscopic supporting structures that can compete with the
optimal nested laminate construction. The derived a posteriori error indicators
allow to verify that the suggested simplified microstructures achieve the
optimal value of the compliance up to a few percent. Furthermore, it is shown
how discretization error and modeling error can be balanced by choosing an
optimal level of grid refinement. Our two scale results with a single scale
microstructure can provide guidance towards the design of a producible
macroscopic fine scale pattern.

an outreach or teaching tool to asses rapidly the current conditions of the
