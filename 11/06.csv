are: (i) clarify several kinds of stationary solutions and their relations;
(ii) develop and establish the convergence of a novel algorithm for computing a
d-stationary solution of a problem with a convex feasible set that is arguably
the sharpest kind among the various stationary solutions; (iii) extend the
algorithm in several directions including: a randomized choice of the
subproblems that could help the practical convergence of the algorithm, a
distributed penalty approach for problems whose objective functions are sums of
dc functions, and problems with a specially structured (nonconvex) dc

qualification is introduced that facilitates the verification and computation
of a B(ouligand)-stationary point.

system with low metallicity [O/H]\,=\,$-2.042 \pm 0.005$ at $z_{\rm abs}=2.437$
towards QSO~J\,1444$+$2919. The hydrogen column density in this system is
log$N$(H\,{\sc i})~$=19.983\pm0.010$ and the measured value of deuterium
abundance is log(D/H)~$=-4.706\pm0.007_{\rm stat}\pm0.067_{\rm syst}$. This
system meets the set of strict selection criteria stated recently by Cooke et
al. and, therefore, widens the {\it Precision Sample} of D/H. However, possible
underestimation of systematic errors can bring bias into the mean D/H value
(especially if use a weighted mean). Hence, it might be reasonable to relax
these selection criteria and, thus, increase the number of acceptable
absorption systems with measured D/H values. In addition, an unweighted mean
value might be more appropriate to describe the primordial deuterium abundance.
The unweighted mean value of the whole D/H data sample available to date (15
measurements) gives a conservative value of the primordial deuterium abundance
(D/H)$_{\rm p}=(2.55\pm 0.19)\times10^{-5}$ which is in good agreement with the
prediction of analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation for the
standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. By means of the derived (D/H)$_{\rm p}$
value the baryon density of the Universe $\Omega_{\rm b}h^2=0.0222\pm0.0013$
and the baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta_{10} = 6.09\pm 0.36$ have been deduced.
These values have confident intervals which are less stringent than that
obtained for the {\it Precision Sample} and, thus, leave a broader window for
new physics. The latter is particularly important in the light of the lithium
problem.

the physical implications of a great majority of such models within a single,
effective field theory framework (including novel models with large
non-Gaussianity discussed for the first time below.) The constraints we
apply---both theoretical and experimental---are found to be rather robust,
determined to a great extent by just three parameters: the coefficients of the

slow-roll parameter $\varepsilon$. This allows to significantly limit the

the existing data still leaves some room for most of the considered models, the
situation would change dramatically if the current upper limit on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio decreased down to $r < 10^{-2}$. Apart from inflationary
models driven by plateau-like potentials, the single-field model that would
have a chance of surviving this bound is the recently proposed slow-roll
inflation with weakly-broken galileon symmetry. In contrast to
\textit{canonical} slow-roll inflation, the latter model can support $r <
10^{-2}$ even if driven by a convex potential, as well as generate observable
values for the amplitude of non-Gaussianity.

initially known to a non-faulty agent only. In particular, we are interested in
the scenario when the computing agents are connected by an arbitrary directed

  The fault-tolerant multi-agent optimization problem was first formulated by
Su and Vaidya, and is solved when the local functions are defined over the

social networks. The effect of such events can be analyzed from several
perspectives, one of them being the intensity and characteristics of the
collective activity that it produces in the social platform. We research 5,234
real-world news events encompassing 43 million messages discussed on the
Twitter microblogging service for approximately 1 year. We show empirically
that exogenous news events naturally create collective patterns of bursty
behavior in combination with long periods of inactivity in the network. This
type of behavior agrees with other patterns previously observed in other types
of natural collective phenomena, as well as in individual human communications.
In addition, we propose a methodology to classify news events according to the
different levels of intensity in activity that they produce. In particular, we
analyze the most highly active events and observe a consistent and strikingly
different collective reaction from users when they are exposed to such events.
This reaction is independent of an event's reach and scope. We further observe
that extremely high-activity events have characteristics that are quite
distinguishable at the beginning stages of their outbreak. This allows us to
predict with high precision, the top 8% of events that will have the most
impact in the social network by just using the first 5% of the information of

magnetoelectric coupling, conventionally parametrized in terms of a phase angle
$\theta$. According to previous theories, $\theta$ can be expressed as a 3D
Brillouin-zone integral of the Chern-Simons 3-form defined in terms of the
occupied Bloch functions. Such an expression is valid only if a smooth and
periodic gauge has been chosen in the entire Brillouin zone, and even then,
convergence with respect to the $\mathbf{k}$-space mesh density can be
difficult to obtain. In order to solve this problem, we propose to relax the
periodicity condition in one direction (say, the $k_z$ direction) so that a
gauge discontinuity is introduced on a 2D $\mathbf{k}$ plane normal to $k_z$.
The total $\theta$ response then has contributions from both the integral of
the Chern-Simons 3-form over the 3D bulk BZ and the gauge discontinuity
expressed as a 2D integral over the $\mathbf{k}$ plane. Sometimes the boundary
plane may be further divided into subregions by 1D ""vortex loops"" which make a
third kind of contribution to the total $\theta$, expressed as a combination of
Berry phases around the vortex loops. The total $\theta$ thus consists of three
terms which can be expressed as integrals over 3D, 2D and 1D manifolds. When
time-reversal symmetry is present and the gauge in the bulk BZ is chosen to
respect this symmetry, both the 3D and 2D integrals vanish; the entire
contribution then comes from the vortex-loop integral, which is either 0 or
$\pi$ corresponding to the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of 3D time-reversal
invariant insulators. We demonstrate our method by applying it to the
Fu-Kane-Mele model with an applied staggered Zeeman field.

this model, there are multiple resources that are available over a finite
horizon. The resources are non-replenishable and perishable. Each unit of a
resource can be instantly made into one of several products. There are multiple
customer types arriving randomly over time. An assortment of products must be
offered to each arriving customer, depending on the type of the customer, the
time of arrival, and the remaining inventory. From this assortment, the
customer selects a product according to a general choice model. The selection
generates a product-dependent and customer-type-dependent reward. The objective
of the system is to maximize the total expected reward earned over the horizon.
  The above problem has a number of applications, including personalized
assortment optimization, revenue management of parallel flights, and web- and
mobile-based appointment scheduling. We derive online algorithms that are
asymptotically optimal and achieve the best constant relative performance

Kagome ice model by Juan Carrasquilla, et al., [Nature Communications 6, 7421

competing interactions between a $Z_2$-invariant easy-axis ferromagnetic
interaction $J_{\pm\pm}$ and a frustrated Ising term $J_z$. As in the
U(1)-invariant model, we obtain four classical distinctive phases, however, the
classical phases in the $Z_2$-invariant model are different. They are as
follows: a fully polarized (FP) ferromagnet for large $h$, an easy-axis canted
ferromagnet (CFM) with broken $Z_2$ symmetry for small $h$ and dominant
$J_{\pm\pm}$, a {\it ferrosolid} phase with broken translational and $Z_2$
symmetries for small $h$ and dominant $J_{z}$, and two lobes with $m=\langle
S_z\rangle=\pm 1/6$ for small $h$ and dominant $J_{z}$. We show that quantum
fluctuations are suppressed in this model, hence the large-$S$ expansion gives
an accurate picture of the ground state properties. When quantum fluctuations
are introduced, we show that the {\it ferrosolid} state is the ground state in
the dominant Ising limit at zero magnetic field. It remains robust for
$J_z\to\infty$. With nonzero magnetic field the classical lobes acquire a
finite magnetic susceptibility with no $S_z$-order. We present the trends of
the ground state energy and the magnetizations. We also present a detail

By summing a recursive series of image systems we derive a numerically

no-shear interface and, from this Green's function, we compute the flows

the image series gives a satisfactory approximation to the swimmer flow fields

the swimmer flows in the thin-film limit. Concentrating on the thick film case,
we find that the dipole moment induces a bias towards swimmer accumulation at
the no-slip wall rather than the water-air interface, but that higher-order
multipole moments can oppose this. Based on the analytic predictions we propose
an experimental method to find the multipole coefficient that induces circular
swimming trajectories, allowing one to analytically determine the swimmer's
three-dimensional position under a microscope.

applications, such as desktop sharing, video conferencing, and remote
education. When compared to natural camera- captured content, screen content
has different characteristics, in particular sharper edges. In this paper, we
propose a novel intra prediction scheme for screen content video. In the
proposed scheme, bilinear interpolation in angular intra prediction in HEVC is
selectively replaced by nearest-neighbor intra prediction to preserve the sharp
edges in screen content video. We present three different variants of the
proposed nearest neighbor prediction algorithm: two implicit methods where both
the encoder, and the decoder derive whether to perform nearest neighbor
prediction or not based on either (a) the sum of the absolute difference, or
(b) the difference between the boundary pixels from which prediction is
performed; and another variant where Rate-Distortion-Optimization (RDO) search
is performed at the encoder to decide whether or not to use the nearest
neighbor interpolation, and explicitly signaled to the decoder. We also discuss
the various underlying trade-offs in terms of the complexity of the three
variants. All the three proposed variants provide significant gains over HEVC,
and simulation results show that average gains of 3.3% BD-bitrate in
Intra-frame coding are achieved by the RDO variant for screen content video. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that 1) points out current
HEVC intra prediction scheme with bilinear interpolation does not work
efficiently for screen content video and 2) uses different filters adaptively
in the HEVC intra prediction interpolation.

cluster-wise inference; in particular, cluster size inference with a cluster
defining threshold of p = 0.01 generates familywise error rates up to 60%. We
conduct a number of follow up analyses and investigations that suggest the
cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial auto correlation functions

learning and inference to $O(n)$, and the standard $O(n^2)$ complexity per test
point prediction to $O(1)$. MSGP involves 1) decomposing covariance matrices as
Kronecker products of Toeplitz matrices approximated by circulant matrices.
This multi-level circulant approximation allows one to unify the orthogonal
computational benefits of fast Kronecker and Toeplitz approaches, and is
significantly faster than either approach in isolation; 2) local kernel
interpolation and inducing points to allow for arbitrarily located data inputs,
and $O(1)$ test time predictions; 3) exploiting block-Toeplitz Toeplitz-block

multidimensional Kronecker structure is not present; and 4) projections of the

effectively ballistic dynamics at large scales, before a re-entrance to

optimal designs for regression models with dependent error processes. In
contrast to most of the work in this field, which starts with a model for a
finite number of observations and considers the asymptotic properties of
estimators and designs as the sample size converges to infinity, our approach
is based on a continuous time model. We use results from stochastic anal- ysis
to identify the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) in this model. Based on
the BLUE, we construct an efficient linear estimator and corresponding optimal
designs in the model for finite sample size by minimizing the mean squared
error between the opti- mal solution in the continuous time model and its
discrete approximation with respect to the weights (of the linear estimator)
and the optimal design points, in particular in the multi-parameter case. In
contrast to previous work on the subject the resulting estimators and
corresponding optimal designs are very efficient and easy to implement. This
means that they are practi- cally not distinguishable from the weighted least
squares estimator and the corresponding optimal designs, which have to be found
numerically by non-convex discrete optimization. The advantages of the new
approach are illustrated in several numerical examples.

the system collapses due to radiation reaction, the Cassini states are shifted

the final spin distribution may differ from the initial one. Our method

spillovers, which has recently been introduced as a new paradigm for
biodiversity in well-mixed microbial populations. Here we study the game in
structured populations, demonstrating that protection spillovers give rise to
spatial patterns that are impossible to observe in the classical
rock-paper-scissors game. We show that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the
system is determined by the density of stable vortices, which may ultimately
transform to frozen states, to propagating waves, or to target waves with
reversed propagation direction, depending further on the degree and type of
randomness in the interactions among the species. If vortices are rare, the
fixation to waves and complex oscillatory solutions is likelier. Moreover,
annealed randomness in interactions favors the emergence of target waves, while
quenched randomness favors collective synchronization. Our results demonstrate
that protection spillovers may fundamentally change the dynamics of cyclic
dominance in structured populations, and they outline the possibility of
programming pattern formation in microbial populations.

parallaxes for more than one billion stars in our Galaxy. It is known that
Gaia's two telescopes are affected by a small but significant variation of the
basic angle between them. Unless this variation is taken into account during
data processing, e.g. using on-board metrology, it causes systematic errors in
the astrometric parameters, in particular a shift of the parallax zero-point.
Previously, we suggested an early reduction of Gaia data for the subset of
Tycho-2 stars (Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution; TGAS).
  Aims. We aim to investigate whether quasars can be used to independently
verify the parallax zero-point already in early data reductions. This is not
trivially possible as the observation interval is too short to disentangle
parallax and proper motion for the quasar subset.
  Methods. We repeat TGAS simulations but additionally include simulated Gaia
observations of quasars from ground-based surveys. All observations are
simulated with basic angle variations. To obtain a full astrometric solution
for the quasars in TGAS we explore the use of prior information for their
proper motions.
  Results. It is possible to determine the parallax zero-point for the quasars
with a few {\mu}as uncertainty, and it agrees to a similar precision with the
zero-point for the Tycho-2 stars. The proposed strategy is robust even for
quasars exhibiting significant fictitious proper motion due to a variable
source structure, or when the quasar subset is contaminated with stars
misidentified as quasars.
  Conclusions. Using prior information about quasar proper motions we could
provide an independent verification of the parallax zero-point in early
solutions based on less than one year of Gaia data.

harder spectra than the prediction of the standard DSA model. One example is
observed in the cluster 1RXS J0603.3+4214, which is often called the

in the spectrum and the position can be solved if turbulent (re)acceleration is
very effective behind the shock. This means that for some relics turbulent
reacceleration may be the main mechanism to produce high-energy electrons,
contrary to the common belief that it is the DSA. Moreover, we show that for
efficient reacceleration, the effective mean free path of the electrons has to
be much smaller than their Coulomb mean free path. We also study the merging

probability distribution functions for the density, metallicity, temperature,
and dust content of the absorbing gas. We find that z>2 LLSs are highly ionised
with ionisation parameters between -3<log U<-2, depending on the HI column
density. LLSs are characterised by low temperatures (T<5x10^4 K) and reside in
dust-poor environments. Between z~2.5-3.5, ~80% of the LLSs have physical
densities between n(H)~10^-3.5-10^-2 cm^-3 for the assumed UV background, but
we caution that a degeneracy between the ionisation parameter and the intensity
of the radiation field prevents robust inference on the density and sizes of
LLSs. Conversely, metallicity estimates are less sensitive to the assumptions
behind ionisation corrections. LLSs at z>2 are characterised by a broad
unimodal distribution over >4 orders of magnitude, with a peak at log
Z/Zsun~-2. LLSs are metal poor, significantly less enriched than DLAs, with
~70% of the metallicity PDF below log Z/Zsun<-1.5. The median metallicity of
super LLSs with log N(HI)>19 rapidly evolves with redshift, with a ten-fold
increase between z~2.1-3.6 (~1.5 Gyr). Based on this sample, we find that LLSs
at z=2.5-3.5 account for ~15% of all the metals produced by UV-selected
galaxies. The implications for theories of cold gas accretion and metal
ejection from galaxies are also discussed.

the correlation between the position of galaxies in the star formation rate
(SFR) versus stellar mass plane and local environment at $z<1.1$. To accurately
estimate the galaxy SFR, we use the deepest available Spitzer/MIPS 24 and
Herschel/PACS datasets. We distinguish group environments (
$M_{halo}\sim$10$^{12.5-14.2}$$M_{\odot}$) based on the available deep X-ray
data and lower halo mass environments based on the local galaxy density. We
confirm that the Main Sequence (MS) of star forming galaxies is not a linear
relation and there is a flattening towards higher stellar masses (
$M_*>10^{10.4-10.6}$ $M_{\odot}$), across all environments. At high redshift (
$0.5<z<1.1$ ), the MS varies little with environment. At low redshift (
$0.15<z<0.5$ ), group galaxies tend to deviate from the mean MS towards the
region of quiescence with respect to isolated galaxies and less-dense
environments. We find that the flattening of the MS toward low SFR is due to an
increased fraction of bulge dominated galaxies at high masses. Instead, the
deviation of group galaxies from the MS at low redshift is caused by a large
fraction of red disk dominated galaxies which are not present in the lower
density environments. Our results suggest that above a mass threshold (
$\sim10^{10.4}-10^{10.6}$$M_{\odot}$ ) stellar mass, morphology and environment
act together in driving the evolution of the SF activity towards lower level.

the supernova having exploded in a cavity before encountering a massive shell
of the progenitor star's stripped hydrogen envelope. Possible origins for the
circumstellar shell include a brief Wolf-Rayet fast wind phase that overtook a
slower red supergiant wind, eruptive ejection, or confinement of circumstellar
material by external influences of neighboring stars. An extended high velocity
Halpha absorption feature seen in near-maximum light spectra implies that the
progenitor star was not completely stripped of hydrogen at the time of core
collapse. Archival pre-explosion Subaru Telescope Suprime-Cam and Hubble Space
Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images of the region obtained in 2009
show a coincident source that is most likely a compact massive star cluster in
NGC 7331 that hosted the progenitor system. By comparing the emission
properties of the source with stellar population models that incorporate
interacting binary stars we estimate the age of the host cluster to be 30 - 300
Myr, and favor ages closer to 30 Myr in light of relatively strong Halpha

a tophat in real space. We measure this profile directly and find that it is
more extended than a tophat but less extended than a Gaussian; its shape is
well-described by rounding the edges of the tophat by convolution with a
Gaussian that has a scale length about 5 times smaller. This effective window
$W_{\rm eff}$ is particularly simple in Fourier space, and has an analytic form
in real space. Together with the excursion set bias parameters, $W_{\rm eff}$
describes the scale-dependence of the Lagrangian halo-matter cross correlation
up to $kR_{\rm Lag} \sim 10 $, where $R_{\rm Lag}$ is the Lagrangian size of
the protohalo. Moreover, with this $W_{\rm eff}$, all the spectral moments of
the power spectrum are finite, allowing a straightforward estimate of the
excursion set peak mass function. This estimate requires a prescription of the
critical overdensity enclosed within a protohalo if it is to collapse, which we
calibrate from simulations. We find that the resulting estimate of halo
abundances is only accurate to about 20%, and we discuss why: A tophat in
`infall time' towards the protohalo center need not correspond to a tophat in
the initial spatial distribution, so models in which infall rather than
smoothed overdensity is the relevant variable may be more accurate.

(SED) fitting to investigate the evolution of the equivalent width (EW) of the

After first demonstrating the ability of our SED-fitting technique to recover
EW(Ha) using a sample of galaxies at z~1.3 with EW(Ha) measurements from 3D-HST
grism spectroscopy, we proceed to apply our technique to samples of
spectroscopically confirmed and photometric-redshift selected star-forming
galaxies at z>=1 in the CANDELS UDS and GOODS-S fields. Confining our analysis
to a constant stellar mass range (9.5<log(M/Msun)<10.5), we find that the
median EW(Ha) evolves only modestly with redshift, reaching a rest-frame value
of EW(Ha)=301+/-30 Angs by redshift z~4.5. Furthermore, using estimates of
star-formation rate (SFR) based on both UV luminosity and Ha line flux, we use
our galaxy samples to compare the evolution of EW(Ha) and specific
star-formation rate (sSFR). Our results indicate that over the redshift range
1<z<5, the evolution displayed by EW(Ha) and sSFR is consistent, and can be
adequately parameterized as: propto (1+z)^(1.0+/-0.2). As a consequence, over
this redshift range we find that the sSFR and rest-frame EW(Ha) of star-forming
galaxies with stellar masses M~10^(10) Msun are related by:
EW(Ha)/Ang=(63+/-7)sSFR/Gyr^(-1). Given the current uncertainties in measuring
the SFRs of high-redshift galaxies, we conclude that EW(Ha) provides a useful

media, from the swimming of flagellated microorganisms in biological fluids, to
the slithering of snakes on land, or the locomotion of sandfish lizards in
sand. Despite the similarity in the undulating pattern, the swimming
characteristics depend on the rheological properties of different media.
Analysis of locomotion in granular materials is relatively less developed
compared with fluids partially due to a lack of validated force models but
recently a resistive force theory in granular media has been proposed and shown
useful in studying the locomotion of a sand-swimming lizard. Here we employ the
proposed model to investigate the swimming characteristics of a slender
filament, of both finite and infinite length, undulating in a granular medium
and compare the results with swimming in viscous fluids. In particular, we
characterize the effects of drifting and pitching in terms of propulsion speed
and efficiency for a finite sinusoidal swimmer. We also find that, similar to
Lighthill's results using resistive force theory in viscous fluids, the
sawtooth swimmer is the optimal waveform for propulsion speed at a given power
consumption in granular media. The results complement our understanding of
undulatory locomotion and provide insights into the effective design of
locomotive systems in granular media.

Universe. Observations and surveys have shown that the number of sources
increases for near galaxies and at the low-luminosity regime (the so-called
LLAGNs). Furthermore, many AGNs show changes in their obscuration properties at
X-rays that may suggest a configuration of clouds very close to the accretion
disk. However, these variations could also be due to changes in the intrinsic
continuum of the source. It is therefore important to study nearby AGN to
better understand the locus and distribution of clouds in the neighbourhood of
the nucleus. We aim to study the nuclear obscuration of LLAGN NGC835 and its
extended emission using mid-infrared observations. We present mid-infrared 11.5
microns imaging of the LLAGN galaxy NGC835 obtained with the instrument
CanariCam in the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC), archival Spitzer/IRS
spectroscopy, and archival Chandra data observed in 2000, 2008, and 2013. The
GTC/CanariCam 11.5 microns image reveals faint extended emission out to ~6
arcsec. We obtained a nuclear flux of F(11.5 microns) ~18 mJy, whereas the
extended emission accounts for 90% of the total flux within the 6 arcsec. This
means that the low angular resolution (~4 arcsec) IRS spectrum is dominated by
this extended emission and not by the AGN, clearly seen in the Spitzer/IRS
spectrum. Although the extended soft X-ray emission shows some resemblance with
that of the mid-infrared, the knots seen at X-rays are mostly located in the
inner side of this mid-infrared emission. The nuclear X-ray spectrum of the
source has undergone a spectral change between 2000/2008 and 2013. We argue
that this is most probably due to changes in the hydrogen column density from ~
8x10E+23 cm-2 to ~ 3x10E+23 cm-2. NGC835 therefore is one of the few LLAGN,
together with NGC1052, in which changes in the absorber can be claimed.

Regardless of the control algorithm for these multi Deformable Mirrors, they

present the analytical description of the different approximations to simulate
these propagation effects. In Annex A, we prove analytically that, in the

high fidelity for simulations of these effects. We provide numerical

framework of the Active Compensation of Aperture Discontinuities technique
(ACAD) applied to pupil geometries similar to WFIRST-AFTA. We present these

been studied to understand such correlations in SrRuO_3. Here we explore the
influence of electron-lattice correlation to electron-transport, at interfaces
between SrRuO_3 and Nb:SrTiO_3 across its ferromagnetic transition, using a
nanoscale transport probe and first-principles calculations. We find that the
geometrical reconstructions at the interface and hence modifications in
electronic structures dominate the transmission across its ferromagnetic

to separate scales in model and observations during data assimilation with the
ensemble Kalman filter. In many applications, the underlying physics of a

observational and model error across scales can result in large forecast
inaccuracies since large errors at one scale are interpreted as inexact data at
all scales. Our method uses a transformation of the observation operator in
order to separate the information from different scales of the observations.
This naturally induces a transformation of the observation covariance and we
put forward several algorithms to efficiently compute the transformed
covariance. Another advantage of our multiresolution ensemble Kalman filter is
that scales can be weighted independently to adjust each scale's effect on the
forecast. To demonstrate feasibility we present applications to a one
dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (K-S) model with scale dependent observation
noise and an application involving the forecasting of solar photospheric flux.
The latter example demonstrates the multiresolution ensemble Kalman filter's
ability to account for scale dependent model error. Modeling of photospheric

dynamics is to be determined by interaction matrix elements between the states
rather than by a Hill-Wheeler construction of a collective coordinate. Within
our approach, several simple limits can be seen: diffusion; quantized
conductance; and ordinary decay through channels. The specific proposal for the
discrete basis is to use the $K^\pi$ quantum numbers of the axially symmetric
Hartree-Fock approximation to generate the configurations. Fission paths would
be determined by hopping from configuration to configuration via the residual
interaction. We show as an example the configurations needed to describe a

demonstrated, a phenomenon which they termed superoscillations. Aharonov and
his collaborators showed that superoscillations naturally arise when dealing
with weak values, a notion that provides a fundamentally different way to
regard measurements in quantum physics. From a mathematical point of view,
superoscillating functions are a superposition of small Fourier components with
a bounded Fourier spectrum, which result, when appropriately summed, in a shift
that can be arbitrarily large, and well outside the spectrum. Purpose of this
work is twofold: on one hand we provide a self-contained survey of the existing
literature, in order to offer a systematic mathematical approach to
superoscillations; on the other hand, we obtain some new and unexpected
results, by showing that superoscillating sequences can be seen of as solutions
to a large class of convolution equations and can therefore be treated within
the theory of Analytically Uniform spaces. In particular, we will also discuss
the persistence of the superoscillatory behavior when superoscillating
sequences are taken as initial values of the Schr\""odinger equation and other
equations.

This work uses support vector regression to formulate a mapping from the
38-dimensional feature space to a continuous-valued label vector representing
flare size or time-to-flare. When we consider flaring regions only, we find an
average error in estimating flare size of approximately half a
\emph{geostationary operational environmental satellite} (\emph{GOES}) class.
When we additionally consider non-flaring regions, we find an increased average
error of approximately 3/4 a \emph{GOES} class. We also consider thresholding
the regressed flare size for the experiment containing both flaring and
non-flaring regions and find a true positive rate of 0.69 and a true negative
rate of 0.86 for flare prediction. The results for both of these size
regression experiments are consistent across a wide range of predictive time
windows, indicating that the magnetic complexity features may be persistent in
appearance long before flare activity. This is supported by our larger error
rates of some 40 hr in the time-to-flare regression problem. The 38 magnetic
complexity features considered here appear to have discriminative potential for
flare size, but their persistence in time makes them less discriminative for
the time-to-flare problem.

performed detailed spatial and spectral analysis of all X-ray components of the

there are large deviations from a simple helical model at small and large
scales. Significant extended emission is now detected, encompassing the main
jet all along its length. The brightness dip of the main jet at ~50"" distance
from the pulsar is confirmed, the extended emission however prevents
conclusions about the coherence at this position of the jet. The counter-jet is
now detected at high statistical significance. In addition, we found two
small-scale ""arcs"" departing from the pulsar towards the jets. We also looked
for possible bow-shock emission in front of the pulsar, with a short VLT/FORS2
H-alpha observation. No clear emission is found, most likely because of
contamination from a diffuse surrounding nebulosity. The results of our X-ray
analysis show that current expectations from a ballistic nature of the jets can
explain satisfactorily some of the observational evidences but cannot fully

along preexisting magnetic field lines in the surrounding medium) however also
continues to suffer from conflicts with the observations.

strong reflection spectral features. The spectral shape changed around the year
2000, dropping in observed flux and becoming much more highly absorbed. Two
scenarios have been put forth to explain this spectral change: 1) the central
X-ray source partially ``shut off'' around this time, decreasing in intrinsic
luminosity, with a delayed decrease in reflection features due to the
light-crossing time of the Compton-thick material or 2) the source became more
heavily obscured, with only a portion of the power law continuum leaking

extrapolations for lattice-QCD polarisability computations. We include both the
leading and sub-leading effects of the nucleon's pion cloud, as well as the
leading ones of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance and its pion cloud. The analytic
results are complete at N$^2$LO in the $\delta$-counting for pion masses close
to the physical value, and at leading order for pion masses similar to the
Delta-nucleon mass splitting. In order to quantify the truncation error of our
predictions and fits as $68$\% degree-of-belief intervals, we use a Bayesian
procedure recently adapted to EFT expansions. At the physical point, our
predictions for the spin polarisabilities are, within respective errors, in
good agreement with alternative extractions using experiments and
dispersion-relation theory. At larger pion masses we find that the chiral
expansion of all polarisabilities becomes intrinsically unreliable as $m_\pi$
approaches about $300\;$MeV---as has already been seen in other observables.
$\chi$EFT also predicts a substantial isospin splitting above the physical
point for both the electric and magnetic scalar polarisabilities; and we
speculate on the impact this has on the stability of nucleons. Our results
agree very well with emerging lattice computations in the realm where $\chi$EFT
converges. Curiously, for the central values of some of our predictions, this
agreement persists to much higher pion masses. We speculate on whether this
might be more than a fortuitous coincidence.

energy storage capacities. In addition, the effect of data processing circuit
power consumption is also addressed. To be specific, two extreme cases are
studied here, where the first assumes ideal/zero circuit power consumption and
the second considers a positive constant circuit power consumption where the
circuit is always operating at its highest power level. The performance of
these two extreme cases hence serve as the upper bound and the lower bound of
the system performance in practice, respectively. In this setting, the offline

The associated optimization problems are formulated and solved in terms of

presented for all cases. Interestingly, for the case with maximum circuit power
consumption, a close-to-optimal online policy is presented and its performance
is shown to be comparable to its offline counterpart in the numerical results.

performed by sampling object proposals in the image. We analyze four different
strategies to perform this sampling, giving special attention to strategies
that exploit spatial relations between objects. In addition, we propose a novel
method to discover higher-order relations between groups of objects.
Experiments on the challenging KITTI dataset show that our proposed
relations-based proposal generation strategies can help improving recall at the
cost of a relatively low amount of object proposals.

and there are relatively few effects, each of large magnitude, we expect the
Lasso to find the important variables with few errors, if any. This paper shows
that in a regime of linear sparsity---meaning that the fraction of variables
with a non-vanishing effect tends to a constant, however small---this cannot
really be the case, even when the design variables are stochastically
independent. We demonstrate that true features and null features are always
interspersed on the Lasso path, and that this phenomenon occurs no matter how
strong the effect sizes are. We derive a sharp asymptotic trade-off between
false and true positive rates or, equivalently, between measures of type I and
type II errors along the Lasso path. This trade-off states that if we ever want
to achieve a type II error (false negative rate) under a critical value, then
anywhere on the Lasso path the type I error (false positive rate) will need to
exceed a given threshold so that we can never have both errors at a low level
at the same time. Our analysis uses tools from approximate message passing

off-equilibrium element is well studied theoretically, but its impact on actual
biological groups deserves more experimental attention. Here, we introduce a
novel dynamical inference technique, based on the principle of maximum entropy,
which accodomates network rearrangements and overcomes the problem of slow

Accordingly, equilibrium inference, which assumes a fixed interaction network,
gives results consistent with dynamical inference. We conclude that bird
orientations are in a state of local quasi-equilibrium over the interaction
length scale, providing firm ground for the applicability of statistical

world and the agent's knowledge and beliefs about the world, but also may
change other agents' knowledge and beliefs about the world and their knowledge

the world, but also their knowledge about other agents' knowledge about the
world. Our goal is to present an action language (mA+) that has the necessary
features to address the above aspects in representing and RAC in MADs. mA+
allows the representation of and reasoning about different types of actions
that an agent can perform in a domain where many other agents might be present
-- such as world-altering actions, sensing actions, and
announcement/communication actions. It also allows the specification of agents'
dynamic awareness of action occurrences which has future implications on what
agents' know about the world and other agents' knowledge about the world. mA+
considers three different types of awareness: full-, partial- awareness, and
complete oblivion of an action occurrence and its effects. This keeps the
language simple, yet powerful enough to address a large variety of knowledge
manipulation scenarios in MADs. The semantics of mA+ relies on the notion of
state, which is described by a pointed Kripke model and is used to encode the
agent's knowledge and the real state of the world. It is defined by a
transition function that maps pairs of actions and states into sets of states.
We illustrate properties of the action theories, including properties that
guarantee finiteness of the set of initial states and their practical
implementability. Finally, we relate mA+ to other related formalisms that
contribute to RAC in MADs.

is generated directly on the chip without the use of any off-chip compensation,

$(|H,V\rangle+|V,H\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ simultaneously utilizing the same pump

biological data has grown drastically. Such data is often modeled as graphs
(also called networks) and studying them can lead to new insights into
molecule-level organization. A possible way to understand their structure is by
analysing the smaller components that constitute them, namely network motifs
and graphlets. Graphlets are particularly well suited to compare networks and
to assess their level of similarity but are almost always used as small
undirected graphs of up to five nodes, thus limiting their applicability in
directed networks. However, a large set of interesting biological networks such
as metabolic, cell signaling or transcriptional regulatory networks are
intrinsically directional, and using metrics that ignore edge direction may
gravely hinder information extraction. The applicability of graphlets is
extended to directed networks by considering the edge direction of the
graphlets. We tested our approach on a set of directed biological networks and
verified that they were correctly grouped by type using directed graphlets.
However, enumerating all graphlets in a large network is a computationally
demanding task. Our implementation addresses this concern by using a
state-of-the-art data structure, the g-trie, which is able to greatly reduce
the necessary computation. We compared our tool, gtrieScanner, to other

Gelfand-Graev formula, which converts the tomographic data into the finite

Pick one such line, call it the $x$-axis, and assume that the function to be
reconstructed depends on a one-dimensional argument by restricting $f$ to the
line. Let $\Omega_1$ be the interval where $f$ is supported, and $\Omega_2$ be
the interval where the Hilbert transform of $f$ can be computed using the
Gelfand-Graev formula. The equation we study is $H_1 f=g|_{\Omega_2}$, where
$H_1$ is the FHT that integrates over $\Omega_1$ and gives the result on
$\Omega_2$, i.e. $H_1: L^2(\Omega_1)\to L^2(\Omega_2)$. In the case of the
interior problem the tomographic data are truncated, and $\Omega_1$ is no
longer a subset of $\Omega_2$. In this paper we consider the case when the
intervals $\Omega_1=(a_1,0)$ and $\Omega_2=(0,a_2)$ are adjacent. Here $a_1 < 0
< a_2$. First we find a differential operator $L$ that commutes with $H_1$.
Using the Titchmarsh-Weyl theory, we show that $L$ has only continuous spectrum
and obtain two isometric transformations $U_1$, $U_2$, such that $U_2 H_1
U_1^*$ is the multiplication operator with the function $\sigma(\lambda)$,
$\lambda\geq(a_1^2+a_2^2)/8$. Here $\lambda$ is the spectral parameter. Then we
show that $\sigma(\lambda)\to0$ as $\lambda\to\infty$ exponentially fast. We
also obtain the leading asymptotic behavior of the kernels involved in the
integral operators $U_1$, $U_2$ as $\lambda\to\infty$. When the intervals are

sciences to study the causal effects of several factors simultaneously on a
response. The objective of such a design is to estimate all factorial effects
of interest, which typically include main effects and interactions among
factors. To estimate factorial effects with high precision when a large number
of pre-treatment covariates are present, balance among covariates across
treatment groups should be ensured. We propose utilizing rerandomization to
ensure covariate balance in factorial designs. Although both factorial designs
and rerandomization have been discussed before, the combination has not. Here,
theoretical properties of rerandomization for factorial designs are
established, and empirical results are explored using an application from the
New York Department of Education.

We focus on a measure of centrality that computes the maximum subtree size of

a uniform attachment model, or a diffusion processes over a regular tree, we
prove that a single node persists as the tree centroid after a finite number of

to the top $K \ge 1$ nodes with respect to the same centrality measure. We also
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the size of an initial seed

$1-\epsilon$, as a function of $\epsilon$: In the case of preferential and
uniform attachment models, we derive bounds for the size of an initial hub

wireless services to users through ambient energy harvesting. Since energy
harvesting is opportunistic in nature, the amount of harvested energy is a
random variable, without a priori known characteristics. We model the network
as a competitive market with uncertainty, where self-interested small cells,
modeled as consumers, are willing to maximize their utility scores by selecting
users, represented by commodities. The utility scores of small cells depend on
the amount of harvested energy, formulated as natures' state. Under this model,
the problem is to assign users to small cells, so that the aggregate network
utility is maximized. The solution is the general equilibrium under
uncertainty, also called Arrow-Debreu equilibrium. We show that in our setting,

exhibit features typical of thermally activated transport, the resistance of
Ni-SiO2-Ni tunnel junctions is drastically increased. Moreover, the transport
mechanism is changed from quantum tunneling through the dielectric barrier to
one consistent with thermally activated resistors in series with tunnel
junctions. The reduction of NiO to Ni is therefore required to restore the
metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure of the junctions. Rapid thermal annealing
in a forming gas ambient at elevated temperatures is presented as a technique
to reduce both parasitic oxide layers. This method is of great interest for

nuclei (AGN), the angular correlation function (ACF) of LBGs and find agreement
within $3\,\sigma$ with new measurements of the ACF from surveys including the
Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) and CANDELS field. Our simulations confirm the
conclusion reached using independent models that although the predicted ACFs
reproduce the trend of increased clustering with luminosity, the dependence is
less strong than observed. We find that for the detection limits of the XDF
field central LBGs at $z\sim 4$ predominantly reside in haloes of mass $\sim
10^{11}-10^{12}h^{-1}M_{\rm \odot}$ and that satellites reside in larger haloes
of mass $\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}h^{-1}M_{\rm \odot}$. The model predicts fewer
bright satellite LBGs at $z\sim4$ than is inferred from measurements of the ACF
at small scales. By analysing the halo occupation distribution (HOD) predicted
by the model, we find evidence that AGN feedback affects the HOD of central
LBGs in massive haloes. This is a new high-redshift test of this important
feedback mechanism. We investigate the effect of photometric errors in the
observations on the ACF predictions. We find that the observational uncertainty
in the galaxy luminosity reduces the clustering amplitude and that this effect
increases towards faint galaxies, particularly on small scales. To compare
properties of model with observed LBGs this uncertainty must be considered.

fulfil this role, but the exact means by which they do so is still the topic of
much debate, with studies finding evidence for both the suppression and
enhancement of star-formation in AGN hosts. Using the ZFOURGE and NMBS galaxy
surveys, we investigate the host galaxy properties of a mass-limited
(M$_{\odot}$ $\ge$ 10$^{10.5}$ M$_{\odot}$), high-luminosity (L$_{1.4}$ $>$
10$^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) sample of radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei to a
redshift of z = 2.25. In contrast to low redshift studies, which associate
radio-AGN activity with quiescent hosts, we find that the majority of z $>$ 1.5
radio-AGN are hosted by star-forming galaxies. Indeed, the stellar populations
of radio-AGN are found to evolve with redshift in a manner that is consistent
with the non-AGN mass-similar galaxy population. Interestingly, we find the
radio-AGN fraction is constant across a redshift range of 0.25 $\le$ z $<$
2.25, perhaps indicating that the radio-AGN duty cycle has little dependence on
redshift or galaxy type. We do however see a strong relation between the
radio-AGN fraction and stellar mass, with radio-AGN becoming rare below $\sim$
10$^{10.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ or a halo-mass of 10$^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$. This halo-mass
threshold is in good agreement with simulations that initiate radio-AGN
feedback at this mass limit. Despite this we find that radio-AGN host
star-formation rates are consistent with the non-AGN mass-similar galaxy

of wurtzite (0001) GaN nanowires (NWs) doped with Gd and point defects by
employing the GGA+U approximation. We find that Ga vacancies (VGa) exhibit
lower formation energy compared to N vacancies (VN). Further stabilization of
point defects occurs due to the presence of Gd and ambient ferromagnetism (FM)
can be stabilized in the NW by the additional positive charge induced by the
VGa. Electronic structure analysis shows that VGa introduces additional levels
in the band gap leading to ferromagnetic coupling due to the hybridization of
the p states of the Ga and N atoms with the Gd d and f states. Ferromagnetic
exchange coupling energy of 76.4meV is obtained in presence of Gd-VGa complex,
and hence the FM is largely determined by the cation vacancy-rare earth complex
defects in GaN NWs. On the other hand, the VN, which introduce additional
electron carriers, does not assist in increasing the ferromagnetic exchange
energy.

controlled by a time-dependent harmonic potential is investigated in the
overdamped and underdamped situations, respectively. Because of different time
scales, the overdamped and underdamped Langevin equations (as well as the
corresponding Fokker-Planck equations) lead to distinctive restrictions on
protocols maintaining canonical distributions. Two special cases are analyzed
in details: First, a Brownian particle is controlled by a time-dependent
harmonic potential and embedded in medium with constant temperature; Second, a
Brownian particle is controlled by a time-dependent harmonic potential and
embedded in a medium whose temperature is tuned together with the potential
stiffness to keep a constant effective temperature of the Brownian particle. We
find that the canonical distributions are usually retainable for both the
overdamped and underdamped situations in the former case. However, the
canonical distributions are retainable merely for the overdamped situation in
the latter case. We also investigate general time-dependent potentials beyond
the harmonic form and find that the retainability of canonical distributions
depends sensitively on the specific form of potentials.

interactions. For this reason, designing quantum information processes with
Hamiltonians consisting of only one- and two-local terms is a worthwhile
challenge. Enabling error suppression with two-local Hamiltonians is
particularly challenging. A no-go theorem of Marvian and Lidar [Physical Review
Letters 113(26), 260504 (2014)] demonstrates that, even allowing particles with
high Hilbert-space dimension, it is impossible to protect quantum information
from single-site errors by encoding in the ground subspace of any Hamiltonian
containing only commuting two-local terms. Here, we get around this no-go
result by encoding in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian consisting of
non-commuting two-local terms arising from the gauge operators of a subsystem
code. Specifically, we show how to protect stored quantum information against
single-qubit errors using a Hamiltonian consisting of sums of the gauge
generators from Bacon-Shor codes [Physical Review A 73(1), 012340 (2006)] and
generalized-Bacon-Shor code [Physical Review A 83(1), 012320 (2011)]. Our
results imply that non-commuting two-local Hamiltonians have more
error-suppressing power than commuting two-local Hamiltonians. While far from
providing full fault tolerance, this approach improves the robustness
achievable in near-term implementable quantum storage and adiabatic quantum
computations, reducing the number of higher-order terms required to encode
commonly used adiabatic Hamiltonians such as the Ising Hamiltonians common in
adiabatic quantum optimization and quantum annealing.

spectroscopy with GALEX UV and ground--based optical imaging to extend the
search for escaping Lyman continuum to a large (~600) sample of z~1 low-mass,
moderately star-forming galaxies selected initially on H$\alpha$ emission. The
characteristic escape fraction of LyC from SFGs that populate this parameter
space remains weakly constrained by previous surveys, but these faint SFGs are
assumed to play a significant role in the reionization of neutral hydrogen in
the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshift (z>6). We do not make an
unambiguous detection of escaping LyC radiation from this $z\sim1$ sample,
individual non--detections to constrain the absolute Lyman continuum escape
fraction, $f_{esc}$<2.1% (3$\sigma$). We measure upper limits of $f_{esc}$<9.6%
from a sample of SFGs selected on high H$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW>200\AA),
which are thought to be close analogs of high redshift sources of reionization.
For reference, we also present an emissivity--weighted escape fraction which is
useful as a measurement of the general contribution of the SFGs to the z~1
ionizing UV background. In the discussion, we consider the implications of
these intermediate redshift constraints for the reionization of hydrogen in the
intergalactic medium at high (z > 6) redshift. If we assume our $z\sim1$ SFGs,
for which we measure this emissivity-weighted $f_{esc}$, are analogs to the
high redshift sources of reionization, we find is difficult reconcile
reionization by faint (M$_{UV}<-13$) SFGs with a low escape fraction
($f_{esc}<$3%), with constraints from independent high redshift observations.
If $f_{esc}$ evolves with redshift, reionization by SFGs may be consistent with
observations from Planck.

(CSS, GPS, HFP) sources are considered to be young radio sources but the
details of their duty cycle are not well understood. In some cases they are
thought to develop in large radio galaxies, while in other cases their jets may
experience intermittent activity or die prematurely and remain confined within
the host galaxy. By studying in a systematic way the presence and the
properties of any extended emission surrounding these compact sources we can
provide firmer constraints on their evolutionary history and on the timescales
of activity of the radio source. Remnant emission from previous outbursts is
supposed to have very low surface brightness and to be brighter at low
frequency. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution
provided by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) we have started a systematic search
of new CSS, GPS and HFP sources with extended emission, as well as a more
detailed study of some well-known of these sources. Here we present the key
points of our search in the LOFAR fields and a more in-depth analysis on the
source B2 0258+35, a CSS source surrounded by a pair of large, diffuse radio

engineering. Despite recent efforts to improve controllability and synchronous
strength, little attention has been paid to the speed of pinning
synchronizability (rate of convergence in pinning control) and the
corresponding pinning node selection. To address this issue, we propose a
hypothesis to restrict the control cost, then build a linear matrix inequality
related to the speed of pinning controllability. By solving the inequality, we
obtain both the speed of pinning controllability and optimal control strength
(feedback gains in pinning control) for all nodes. Interestingly, some
low-degree nodes are able to achieve large feedback gains, which suggests that
they have high influence on controlling system. In addition, when choosing
nodes with high feedback gains as pinning nodes, the controlling speed of real
systems is remarkably enhanced compared to that of traditional large-degree and
large-betweenness selections. Thus, the proposed approach provides a novel way
to investigate the speed of pinning controllability and can evoke other
effective heuristic pinning node selections for large-scale systems.

a sudden structural collapse, but remarkably returns back to its original shape
after a short transient. We recently reported the first experimental
observation of this effect in a fiber laser (A. F. J. Runge et al., Optica 2,
36 (2015)). Here, we expand on our initial work, presenting a more detailed
experimental and numerical study of the characteristics and dynamics of soliton
explosions in passively mode-locked fiber lasers. Specifically, we explore
different cavity configurations and gain levels, observing and characterizing
explosion events using spectral and temporal real-time single-shot techniques.
Our results highlight that the explosion characteristics observed in
experiments depend critically on the position in the cavity where the output
coupler is located. Furthermore, we find that the frequency at which explosions
occur can be controlled by adjusting the pump power. We also identify a new
kind of ``partial'' explosion, where strong spectral interference fringes
appear on the pulse spectra, but a full collapse is avoided. Finally, we
perform numerical simulations based on a realistic iterative cavity map, and
obtain results that are in good agreement with experimental measurements.
Careful analysis of the simulation results provide strong credence to the
interpretation that soliton explosions can be linked to a multi-pulsing
instability.

$0<p \le 1$, the function space ${\mathcal M}_{p,\phi}({\mathbb R}^n)$ is
difficult to handle as many examples show.
  The aim of this paper is twofold. One of them is to propose a way to deal

propose here a way to consider the decomposition method of generalized

Generalized Hardy-Morrey spaces emerged from generalized Morrey spaces. By
means of the grand maximal operator and the norm of generalized Morrey spaces,
we can define generalized Hardy-Morrey spaces. With this culmination, we can
easily refine the existing results. In particular, our results complement the
one the 2014 paper by Iida, the third author and Tanaka; there was a mistake

methods. We show that among the perturbative approaches, effective field theory
succeeds in extending the range of validity furthest on intermediate scales, at
the cost of free additional parameters. By studying the halo model, we show
that although it is satisfactory in the deeply non-linear regime, it predicts a
deficit of power on intermediate scales, worsening at redshifts $z>0$. By
comparison with the $N$-body bispectrum on those scales, we show that there is
a significant squeezed component underestimated in the halo model. On the basis
of these results, we propose a new three-shape model, based on the tree-level,
squeezed and constant bispectrum shapes we identified in the halo model; after
calibration this fits the simulations on all scales and redshifts of interest.
We extend this model further to primordial non-Gaussianity of the local and
equilateral types by showing that the same shapes can be used to describe the
additional non-Gaussian component in the matter bispectrum. This method
provides a HALOFIT-like prototype of the bispectrum that could be used to

interpret structure in data sets with multiple outcomes and many predictors
(possibly exceeding the sample size), we introduce a multivariate extension to
a decision tree ensemble method called Gradient Boosted Regression Trees
(Friedman, 2001). Our method, multivariate tree boosting, can be used for
identifying important predictors, detecting predictors with non-linear effects
and interactions without specification of such effects, and for identifying
predictors that cause two or more outcome variables to covary without

univariate boosting in the R package 'gbm' (Ridgeway, 2013) to continuous,
multivariate outcomes. To illustrate the approach, we analyze predictors of
psychological well-being (Ryff and Keyes, 1995). Simulations verify that our

multivariate multiple regression and multivariate decision trees over a wide

to that from completely deconfined colored states. This entropy deficit is due
to the persistence of Gauss's law, and actually independent of the shape of the

the topological entangle entropy both in the corresponding $4+1 D$ bulk theory
and the dimensionally reduced theory. First, entanglement entropy in the bulk

surface, which naturally gives rise to an area-law term. The topological term
results from the Gauss's constraint of these surface states. Secondly, the
high-temperature limit also defines a dimensionally reduced theory. We
calculate the geometric entropy in the reduced theory explicitly, and find that
it is given by the same constant term after subtracting the leading term of
${\mathcal O}(\beta^{-1})$. The two procedures are then applied to the
confining phase, by extending the temperature to the complex plane.
Generalizing the recently proposed $2D$ modular description to an arbitrary
matter content, we show the leading local term is missing and no topological
term could be definitely isolated. For the special case of ${\mathcal N}=4$
super Yang-Mills theory, the results obtained here are compared with that at
strong coupling from the holographic derivation.

efficacy of the model and initial results. Hadoop presents a complex execution
environment, where costs and performance depends on a large number of software

results are accompanied by a test bed and tools to deploy and evaluate the
cost-effectiveness of the different hardware configurations, parameter tunings,

benchmarking, it became clear that a genuinely comprehensive study requires
automation of modeling procedures to allow a systematic analysis of large and
resource-constrained search spaces. ALOJA-ML provides such an automated system
allowing knowledge discovery by modeling Hadoop executions from observed
benchmarks across a broad set of configuration parameters. The resulting
performance models can be used to forecast execution behavior of various
workloads; they allow 'a-priori' prediction of the execution times for new
configurations and HW choices and they offer a route to model-based anomaly
detection. In addition, these models can guide the benchmarking exploration
efficiently, by automatically prioritizing candidate future benchmark tests.
Insights from ALOJA-ML's models can be used to reduce the operational time on
clusters, speed-up the data acquisition and knowledge discovery process, and
importantly, reduce running costs. In addition to learning from the methodology
presented in this work, the community can benefit in general from ALOJA

issues of scale-dependent galaxy bias and nonlinearity from galaxy clustering
statistics, but these benefits have yet to be thoroughly tested for realistic
galaxy samples. In this paper, we test the effectiveness of the Gaussianization
transform for different galaxy types by applying it to realistic simulated blue
and red galaxy samples. We show that in real space, the shapes of the
Gaussianized power spectra of both red and blue galaxies agree with that of the
underlying dark matter, with the initial power spectrum, and with each other to
smaller scales than do the statistics of the usual (untransformed) density
field. However, we find that the agreement in the Gaussianized statistics
breaks down in redshift space. We attribute this to the fact that red and blue
galaxies exhibit very different fingers of god in redshift space. After
applying a finger-of-god compression, the agreement on small scales between the
Gaussianized power spectra is restored. We also compare the Gaussianization
transform to the clipped galaxy density field and find that while both methods
are effective in real space, they have more complicated behaviour in redshift
space. Overall, we find that Gaussianization can be useful in recovering the
shape of the underlying dark matter power spectrum to k ~ 0.5 h/Mpc and of the
initial power spectrum to k ~ 0.4 h/Mpc in certain cases at z = 0.

cubature formulae are optimal and universal for various settings
(Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces) of functions with dominating mixed smoothness.
Those cubature formulae go well together with functions supported inside the
unit cube $[0,1]^d$. The question for the optimal numerical integration of
multivariate functions with non-trivial boundary data, in particular
non-periodic functions, arises. In this paper we give a general result that the
asymptotic rate of the minimal worst-case integration error is not affected by
boundary conditions in the above mentioned spaces. In fact, we propose two
tailored modifications of Frolov's cubature formulae suitable for functions
supported on the cube (not in the cube) which provide the same minimal
worst-case error up to a constant. This constant involves the norms of a
``change of variable'' and a ``pointwise multiplication'' mapping,
respectively, between the function spaces of interest. In fact, we complement,
extend and improve classical results by Bykovskii, Dubinin and Temlyakov on the
boundedness of change of variable mappings in Besov-Sobolev spaces of mixed
smoothness. Our proof technique relies on a new characterization via integral
means of mixed differences and maximal function techniques, general enough to
treat Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces at once. The second modification, which
only tackles the case of periodic functions, is based on a pointwise
multiplication and is therefore most likely more suitable for applications than
the (traditional) ``change of variable'' approach. These new theoretical
insights are expected to be useful for the design of new (and robust) cubature
rules for multivariate functions on the cube.

Then, we analyze the simplest version of the model, using path integral and
Green's function techniques from physics. We show that in this model, the
inefficient market price is trend-following when the standard deviation of the
log reasonable price ($\sigma$) is larger than that of the log market price
($\sigma'$), and mean-reversing when it is smaller. The risk premium is
proportional to the difference between the current market price and the
exponential moving average (EMA) of the past prices. This model thus provides a
theoretical explanation how the EMA of the past price can directly affect
future prices, i.e., the so-called ``Bollinger bands"" in technical analyses. We
then carry out a maximum likelihood estimate for the model parameters from the
observed market price, by integrating out the reasonable price in Fourier
space. Finally we analyze recent S\&P500 index data and see to what extent the

due to dynamic flexural phonons and static wrinkling. We explore the
consequences of this crumpling on the effective mechanical constants of
graphene. We develop a sensitive experimental approach to probe stretching of
graphene membranes under low applied stress at cryogenic to room temperatures.
We find that the in-plane stiffness of graphene is between 20 and 100 N/m at
room temperature, much smaller than 340 N/m (the value expected for flat
graphene). Moreover, while the in-plane stiffness only increases moderately
when the devices are cooled down to 10 K, it approaches 300 N/m when the aspect
ratio of graphene membranes is increased. These results indicate that softening
of graphene at temperatures less than 400 K is caused by static wrinkling, with
only a small contribution due to flexural phonons. Together, these results
explain the large variation in reported mechanical constants of graphene
devices and paves the way towards controlling their mechanical properties.

macroscopic failure properties is an important challenge in solid mechanics.
Indeed, when a crack propagates at a heterogeneous brittle interface, the front
is trapped by tougher regions and deforms. This pinning induces non-linearities
in the crack propagation problem, even within Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics
theory, and modifies the overall failure properties of the material. For
example crack front pinning by tougher places could increase the fracture
resistance of multilayer structures, with interesting technological
applications. Analytical perturbation approaches, based on Bueckner-Rice
elastic line models, focus on the crack front perturbations, hence allow for a
description of these phenomena. Here, they are applied to experiments
investigating the propagation of a purely interfacial crack in a simple
toughness pattern: a single defect strip surrounded by homogeneous interface.
We show that by taking into account the finite size of the body, quantitative
agreement with experimental and finite elements results is achieved. In
particular this method allows to predict the toughness contrast, i.e. the
toughness difference between the single defect strip and its homogeneous
surrounding medium. This opens the way to a more accurate use of the
perturbation method to study more disordered heterogeneous materials, where the
finite elements method is less adequate. From our results, we also propose a
simple method to determine the adhesion energy of tough interfaces by measuring
the crack front deformation induced by known interface patterns.

hybrid post-Newtonian/Numerical Relativity waveforms which contain higher order

occur for mass ratio $q\geq6$ and $M \geq 100M_\odot$ due to the neglection of
higher modes. Moreover, for iLIGO and eaLIGO, losses notably increase up to
$(39,23)\%$ respectively for the highest mass $(220M_\odot)$ and mass ratio

observation-averaged systematic parameter biases towards lower spin, total mass

A",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Weak measurements are a subset of measurement processes in quantum mechanics
wherein the system which is being measured interacts very weakly with the
measuring apparatus. Measurement values of observables undergoing a weak
interaction and their amplification, are concepts that have sharpened our
understanding of interaction processes in quantum mechanics. Recent experiments
show that naturally occurring processes such as resonance fluorescence from
excited states of an atom can exhibit weak value amplification effect. In this
paper, we theoretically analyze the process of elastic resonance fluorescence
from a V-type three level atomic system, using the well known Weiskopff-Wigner
(W-W) theory of spontaneous emission. Within this theory, we show that, a weak
interaction regime can be identified and for suitable choices of initial and
final excited states, the mean scattering time between these states show an
amplification effect during interaction with the vacuum bath modes of the
electromagnetic field. We thus show for the first time that a system bath
interaction can show weak value amplification. Using our theory we reproduce
the published experimental results carried out in such a system. More
importantly, our theory can calculate scattering timescales in elastic
resonance scattering between multiple excited states of a single atom or
between common excited state configurations of interacting multi-atom systems.

energy release rate of adhesives in mode I. Provided that the adherends stay
elastic, that the adhesive layer is not too flexible and that inertia effects
can be neglected, the experiment allows to identify the work required by the
adhesive layer per area of crack growth. The evaluation according to the
standard does not permit to distinguish between different sources of
dissipation in the adhesive layer or at the adhesive-adherend interfaces,
though. This paper proposes two approaches to gain a more detailed
understanding of the dissipation in mode I crack growth of adhesive layers.
  The first investigation method uses detailed finite element simulations of
the TDCB test based on an elastic-plastic adhesive material model derived from
tests on bulk specimens. The simulation is used to distinct between the work
required for the plastic deformation of the entire adhesive layer and the work
consumed by the crack and the adhesive in its vicinity. The dependence of this
distribution of work on the adhesive layer thickness is studied. The second
approach adds a temperature measurement by an infrared camera to the TDCB test.
This measurement allows observation of the thermo-elastic effect in the
adhesive layer and of the heat generation at the crack. Finally, the results of
the two approaches are employed to estimate the energy balance in the TDCB
test.

the nodes into $\ell$ clusters, each of size $k$, such that frequently

updated dynamically by migrating nodes between clusters. The goal is to devise
online algorithms which jointly minimize the amount of inter-cluster

scenarios with $k=2$ constitute a novel online variant of maximum matching. We
present several lower bounds and algorithms for settings both with and without
cluster-size augmentation. In particular, we prove that any deterministic
online algorithm has a competitive ratio of at least $k$, even with significant

luminous galaxies and Palomar-Green QSOs, with different levels and structures
of star formation. Assuming Gaussian spatial distribution of the far-infrared
(FIR) emission, the excellent stability of the Herschel point spread function
(PSF) enables us to measure sizes well below the PSF width, by subtracting
widths in quadrature. We derive scalings of FIR size and surface brightness of
local galaxies with FIR luminosity, with distance from the star-forming
main-sequence, and with FIR color. Luminosities L_FIR ~ 10^11 L_Sun can be
reached with a variety of structures spanning 2 dex in size. Ultraluminous
L_FIR >~ 10^12 L_Sun galaxies far above the main-sequence inevitably have small
Re_70um ~ 0.5 kpc FIR emitting regions with large surface brightness, and can
be close to optically thick in the FIR on average over these regions. Compared
to these local relations, first ALMA sizes for the dust emission regions in
high redshift galaxies, measured at somewhat longer rest wavelengths, suggest
larger sizes at the same IR luminosity. We report a remarkably tight relation
with 0.15 dex scatter between FIR surface brightness and the ratio of [CII]
158um emission and FIR emission -- the so-called [CII]-deficit is more tightly
linked to surface brightness than to FIR luminosity or FIR color. Among 33 z <~

size for galaxies with similar L_FIR but lacking a QSO, in accordance with a
scenario where the rest FIR emission of these types of QSOs is, in most cases,
due to host star formation.

height inside a box of lateral size r and the LRD P_r(w_2) is sampled as this
box glides along a surface with size L >> r. The variation coefficient C and
the skewness S of the distributions are functions of the scaled box size r /
xi, where xi(t) is a correlation length. For r <~ 0.3 xi, plateaus of C and S
are observed, but with a small time dependence. For a quantitative
characterization of the universal LRD, extrapolation of these values with
power-law corrections in time are performed. The reliability of this procedure
is confirmed in 1+1 dimensions by comparison of results of the restricted
solid-on-solid model and theoretically predicted values of Edwards-Wilkinson
interfaces. For r >> xi, C and S vanish because the LRD converges to a Dirac
delta function. This confirms the inadequacy of extrapolations of amplitude
ratios to r -> infinity, as proposed in recent works. On the other hand, it
highlights the advantage of scaling LRDs by the average instead of scaling by
the variance due to the usually higher accuracy of C compared to S. The scaled
LRD of the VLDS model is very close to the KPZ one due to the small difference
between their variation coefficients and the plateaus of C and S are very
narrow due to the slow time increase of xi. These results suggest that
experimental LRDs obtained in short growth times and with limited resolution
may be inconclusive to determine their universality classes if data accuracy is
low and/or data extrapolation to the long time limit is not feasible.

energies exceeding 100 keV are seen upstream of the bow shock when the magnetic
geometry is quasi-parallel, and large-scale supernova remnant shocks can
accelerate ions into cosmic rays energies. This energization is attributed to
diffusive shock acceleration, however, for this process to become active the
ions must first be sufficiently energized. How and where this initial
acceleration takes place has been one of the key unresolved issues in shock
acceleration theory. Using Cluster spacecraft observations, we study the
signatures of ion reflection events in the turbulent transition layer upstream

the shock, we show that these reflection signatures are characteristic of the
first step in the ion injection process. These reflection events develop in
particular in the region where the trailing edge of large-amplitude upstream
waves intercept the local shock ramp and the upstream magnetic field changes
from quasi-perpendicular to quasi-parallel. The dispersed ion velocity
signature observed can be attributed to a rapid succession of ion reflections
at this wave boundary. After the ions' initial interaction with the shock, they
flow upstream along the quasi-parallel magnetic field. Each subsequent wave
front in the upstream region will sweep the ions back toward the shock, where
they gain energy with each transition between the upstream and the shock wave
frames. Within three to five gyroperiods, some ions have gained enough parallel
velocity to escape upstream, thus completing the injection process.

along the radial direction from the origin, a locally Minkowski spacetime, to
the horizon, a locally Rindler space times a sphere, represents just the
tachyon condensation process, therefore providing a geometric picture of
tachyon condensation. We further study a scalar in global or flat dS and the
tachyon fluctuations in a homogeneous tachyon background, representing either
the full or half S-brane, on unstable D-branes and find that certain dynamics
of the dS universe corresponds to that of the homogeneous full or half S-brane.

the CMB radiation, namely the spectral index $n_s$, its running $\alpha_s$, the
running of the running $\beta_s$, using a growing body of measurements of CMB
anisotropies by the Planck satellite and other missions. These values do not
follow the hierarchy of sizes predicted by single field, slow roll inflationary
theory, and are thus difficult to fit for such inflation models.
  In this work we present first a study of 49 single field, slow roll
inflationary potentials in which we assess the likelyhood of these models
fitting the spectral parameters to their currently most accurate determination
given by the PLANCK collaboration. We check numerically with a MATLAB program
the spectral parameters that each model can yield for a very broad,
comprehensive list of possible parameter and field values. The comparison of
spectral parameter values supported by the models with their determinations by
the PLANCK collaboration leads to the conclusion that the data provided by
PLANCK2015 TT+lowP and PLANCK2015 TT,TE,EE+lowP taking into account the running
of the running disfavours 40 of the 49 models with confidence level at least
92.8\%.
  Next, we discuss the reliability of the current computations of these
spectral parameters. We identify a bias in the method of determination of the
spectral parameters by least residue parameter fitting (using MCMC or any other
scheme) currently used to reconstruct the power spectrum of scalar
perturbations. This bias can explain the observed contradiction between theory
and observations. Its removal is computationally costly, but necessary in order
to compare the forecasts of single field, slow roll theories with observations.

organization of neurons and dynamic patterns in data-driven hierarchical data
structures. These structures provide local to global data representations, from
local partitioning of the data in flexible trees through a new multiscale
metric to a global manifold embedding. The application of our techniques to
in-vivo neuronal recordings demonstrate the capability of extracting neuronal
activity patterns and identifying temporal trends, associated with particular
behavioral events and manipulations introduced in the experiments.

along filaments and posing significant consequences on mixing. The magnitude of
the FTLEs is observed to be strongly determined by the vertical shear. A
scaling law relating the local FTLEs and the nonlocal density contrast used to

law only converges to the values found from the simulations within the
pycnocline, while it displays differences within the ML, where the

the FTLEs wavenumber spectra display -2 slopes, corresponding to frontal

developmental biology, biophysicists and applied mathematicians made different
proposals to realize this metaphor in a rationalized way. We adopt
comprehensive perspectives to systematically investigate three different but
closely related realizations in recent literature: namely the potential
landscape theory from the steady state distribution of stochastic differential
equations (SDEs), the quasi-potential from the large deviation theory, and the
construction through SDE decomposition and A-type integral.The connections
among these theories are established in this paper. We demonstrate that the
quasi-potential is the zero noise limit of the potential landscape. We also
show that the potential function in the third proposal coincides with the
quasi-potential. The most probable transition path by minimizing the
Onsager-Machlup or Freidlin-Wentzell action functional is discussed as well.
Furthermore, we compare the difference between local and global quasi-potential
through the exchange of limit order for time and noise amplitude. As a
consequence of such explorations, we arrive at the existence result for the SDE
decomposition while deny its uniqueness in general cases. It is also clarified
that the A-type integral is more appropriate to be applied to the decomposed
SDEs rather than the original one. Our results contribute to a better
understanding of existing landscape theories for biological systems.

developed in frames of modified model with no associations of a binary ionic
mixture (BIM) on a homogeneous compressible ideal background (or non-ideal)
electron gas /BIM($\sim$)/. The analytical approximation for equation of state
equation of state of Potekhin and Chabrier of fully ionized electron-ionic
plasma was used for description of the ion-ion correlations (Coulomb
non-ideality) in combination with ``linear mixture'' (LM) approximation. Phase
equilibrium for the charged species was calculated according to the
Gibbs-Guggenheim conditions. The presently considered BIM($\sim$) model allows
to calculate full set of parameters for phase boundaries of non-congruent
variant of phase equilibrium and to study all features for this non-congruent
phase transition realization in Coulomb system in comparison with the simpler
(standard) forced-congruent evaporation mode. In particular, in BIM($\sim$)
there were reproduced two-dimensional remarkable (``banana-like'') structure of
two-phase region $P-T$ diagram and the characteristic non-monotonic shape of
caloric phase enthalpy-temperature diagram, similar to the non-congruent
evaporation of reactive plasma products in high-temperature heating with the
uranium-oxygen system. The parameters of critical points (CP) line were
calculated on the entire range of proportions of ions $0<X<1$, including two
reference values, when CP coincides with a point of extreme temperature and
extreme pressure, $X_{T}$ and $X_{P}$. Finally, it is clearly demonstrated the
low-temperature property of non-congruent gas--liquid
transition---``distillation'', which is weak in chemically reactive plasmas.

line widths, either the cores are subvirial and are thus young structures on
the verge of near free-fall collapse, or they are threaded by $\sim1$ mG
$B$-fields that help support them in near virial equilibrium and potentially
have older ages. We modeled the deuteration rate of $\rm N_2H^+$ to constrain
collapse rates of the cores. First, to measure their current deuterium
fraction, $D_{\rm
  frac}^{\rm N_2H^+}$ $\equiv [\rm N_2D^+]/[N_2H^+]$, we observed multiple
transitions of $\rm N_2H^+$ and $\rm N_2D^+$ with $CARMA$, $SMA$, $JCMT$,
$NRO~45m$ and $IRAM~30m$, to complement the $ALMA$ data. For both cores we
derived $D_{\rm
  frac}^{\rm N_2H^+}\sim0.3$, several orders of magnitude above the cosmic
[D]/[H] ratio. We then carried out chemodynamical modeling, exploring how
collapse rate relative to free-fall, $\alpha_{\rm ff}$, affects the level of
$D_{\rm frac}^{\rm N_2H^+}$ that is achieved from a given initial condition. To
reach the observed $D_{\rm frac}^{\rm
  N_2H^+}$, most models require slow collapse with $\alpha_{\rm
  ff}\sim0.1$, i.e., $\sim1/10$th of free-fall. This makes it more likely that
the cores have been able to reach a near virial equilibrium state and we
predict that strong $B$-fields will eventually be detected. The methods
developed here will be useful for measurement of the pre-stellar core mass
function.

host stars. Asteroseismology is a valuable tool in the characterisation of
stars and \Kepler is an excellent observing facility to perform
asteroseismology. Here we select a sample of 35 \Kepler solar-type stars which
host transiting exoplanets (or planet candidates) with detected solar-like
oscillations. Using available \Kepler short cadence data up to Quarter 16 we
create power spectra optimised for asteroseismology of solar-type stars. We
identify modes of oscillation and estimate mode frequencies by ``peak bagging''
using a Bayesian MCMC framework. In addition, we expand the methodology of
quality assurance using a Bayesian unsupervised machine learning approach. We
report the measured frequencies of the modes of oscillation for all 35 stars
and frequency ratios commonly used in detailed asteroseismic modelling. Due to
the high correlations associated with frequency ratios we report the covariance
matrix of all frequencies measured and frequency ratios calculated. These
frequencies, frequency ratios, and covariance matrices can be used to obtain
tight constraint on the fundamental parameters of these planet-hosting stars.

microspheres inside a liquid medium for geometric aspect ratios far beyond the
validity of the widely employed proximity force approximation. This setup has
the potential for revealing unprecedented features associated to the
non-trivial role of the spherical curvatures. For a proof of concept, we
measure femtonewton double layer forces between polystyrene microspheres at
distances above $400$ nm by employing very soft optical tweezers, with
stiffness of the order of fractions of a fN/nm. As a future application, we
propose to tune the Casimir interaction between a metallic and a polystyrene
microsphere in saline solution from attraction to repulsion by varying the salt
concentration. With those materials, the screened Casimir interaction may have
a larger magnitude than the unscreened one. This line of investigation has the
potential for bringing together different fields including classical and
quantum optics, statistical physics and colloid science, while paving the way
for novel quantitative applications of optical tweezers in cell and molecular
biology.

which is motivated by solving the gauge hierarchy problem. In this context, the
Higgs mass vanishes at the UV scale due to the classically scale invariance,
and is generated via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. Since the mass generation
should occur not so far from the electroweak scale, we extend the standard
model only around the TeV scale. We construct a model which can achieve the
gauge coupling unification at the UV scale. In the same way, the model can
realize the vacuum stability, smallness of active neutrino masses, baryon
asymmetry of the universe, and dark matter relic abundance. The model predicts
the existence vector-like fermions charged under $SU(3)_C$ with masses lower
than $1\,{\rm TeV}$, and the SM singlet Majorana dark matter with mass lower
than $2.6\,{\rm TeV}$.

observable having nonnegative expectation value in every separable state. Then
a state is entangled if and only if it has a negative expectation value of some
entanglement witness. Equivalent representations of entanglement witnesses are
as nonnegative biquadratic forms or as positive linear maps of Hermitian
matrices. As reported elsewhere, we have studied extremal entanglement
witnesses in dimension $3\times 3$ by constructing numerical examples of
generic extremal nonnegative forms. These are so complicated that we do not
know how to handle them other than by numerical methods. However, the
corresponding extremal positive maps can be presented graphically, as we
attempt to do in the present paper. We understand that a positive map is
extremal when the image of $\mathcal{D}$, the set of density matrices, fills
out $\mathcal{D}$ maximally, in a certain sense. For the graphical presentation
of a map we transform it to a standard form where it is unital and trace
preserving. We present an iterative algorithm for the transformation, which
converges rapidly in all our numerical examples and presumably works for any
positive map. This standard form of an entanglement witness is unique up to
unitary product transformations.

this means counting walks in the first quadrant of the plane (possibly after a

investigate the two most natural cases: first, square lattice walks avoiding
the negative quadrant Q 1 = {(i, j) : i \textless{} 0 and j \textless{} 0}, and
then, square lattice walks avoiding the West quadrant Q 2 = {(i, j) : i
\textless{} j and i \textless{} --j}. In both cases, the generating function
that counts walks starting from the origin is found to differ from a simple
D-finite series by an algebraic one. We also obtain closed form expressions for
the number of n-step walks ending at certain prescribed endpoints, as a sum of
three hypergeometric terms. One of these terms already appears in the
enumeration of square lattice walks confined to the cone {(i, j) : i +j $\ge$ 0

walks follows, by the reflection principle, from the enumeration of walks
starting from (--1, 0) and avoiding Q 1. Their generating function turns out to
be purely algebraic (as the generating function of Gessel's walks). Another
approach to Gessel's walks consists in counting walks that start from (--1, 1)

nodes in the RWPM being located near the centre of the domain resulting in
increased levels of interference between neighbouring devices. A non-trivial
trade-off therefore exists between the spatial intensity of interfering signals

the automatic synchronization of files between multiple client devices and 2)
the possibility to share files with other users. However, privacy of cloud data
is a growing concern for both individuals and businesses. Encrypting data on
the client-side before uploading it is an effective privacy safeguard, but it
requires all client devices to have the decryption key. Current solutions
derive these keys solely from user-chosen passwords, which have low entropy and
are easily guessed.
  We present OmniShare, the first scheme to allow client-side encryption with
high-entropy keys whilst providing an intuitive key distribution mechanism to
enable access from multiple client devices. Instead of passwords, we use low
bandwidth uni-directional out-of-band (OOB) channels, such as QR codes, to
authenticate new devices. To complement these OOB channels, the cloud storage
itself is used as a communication channel between devices in our protocols. We
rely on a directory-based key hierarchy with individual file keys to limit the
consequences of key compromise and allow efficient sharing of files without
requiring re-encryption. OmniShare is open source software and currently
available for Android and Windows with other platforms in development. We
describe the design and implementation of OmniShare, and explain how we
evaluated its security using formal methods, its performance via real-world
benchmarks, and its usability through a cognitive walkthrough.

especially in III-V compounds is still controversial. Many questions and open
issues are under intensive debates. Why after so many years of investigations
Mn doped GaAs remains the candidate with the highest Curie temperature among
the broad family of III-V materials doped with transition metal (TM) impurities
? How can one understand that these temperatures are almost two orders of
magnitude larger than that of hole doped (Zn,Mn)Te or (Cd,Mn)Se? Is there any
intrinsic limitation or is there any hope to reach in the dilute regime room
temperature ferromagnetism? How can one explain the proximity of (Ga,Mn)As to
the metal-insulator transition and the change from
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) couplings in II-VI compounds to double
exchange type in (Ga,Mn)N? In spite of the great success of density functional
theory based studies to provide accurately the critical temperatures in various
compounds, till very lately a theory that provides a coherent picture and
understanding of the underlying physics was still missing. Recently, within a
minimal model it has been possible to show that among the physical parameters,
the key one is the position of the TM acceptor level. By tuning the value of
that parameter, one is able to explain quantitatively both magnetic and
transport properties in a broad family of DMS. We will see that this minimal
model explains in particular the RKKY nature of the exchange in
(Zn,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mn)Te and the double exchange type in (Ga,Mn)N and simultaneously
the reason why (Ga,Mn)As exhibits the highest critical temperature among both
II-VI and III-V DMS.

hierarchical search has been widely accepted to reduce the complexity, and its
performance is highly dependent on the codebook design. In this paper, we
propose two basic criteria for the hierarchical codebook design, and devise an
efficient hierarchical codebook by jointly exploiting sub-array and

conducted under different system and channel models. Results show superiority

type schemes on moving grids in one spatial dimension combined with appropriate
predictor-corrector method to achieve higher resolution. The underlying finite
volume scheme is conservative and it is accurate up to the second order in
space. The main novelty consists in the motion of the grid. This new dynamic
aspect can be used to resolve better the areas with large solution gradients or
any other special features. No interpolation procedure is employed, thus
unnecessary solution smearing is avoided, and therefore, our method enjoys
excellent conservation properties. The resulting grid is completely
redistributed according the choice of the so-called monitor function. Several
more or less universal choices of the monitor function are provided. Finally,
the performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated on several examples
stemming from the simple linear advection to the simulation of complex shallow
water waves. The exact well-balanced property is proven. We believe that the
techniques described in our paper can be beneficially used to model tsunami
wave propagation and run-up.

  Issue 11, pages 885-890, 2015",,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present study is based on a generalized form of Brans-Dicke (BD) theory
where, the dimensionless BD parameter is regarded as a function of the scalar
field, which is reciprocal of the gravitational constant. The field equations
have been solved by incorporating an empirical function f(t) in the expression
representing the conservation of matter. This function f(t) has been chosen to
account for a conversion of matter (both dark and baryonic) into some other
form, possibly dark energy, which is known to be responsible for the
accelerated expansion of universe. The requirement of a signature flip of the
deceleration parameter (q), which is evident from other studies, sets the
boundary conditions to be satisfied by the function f(t), leading to the
formulation of its time dependence. A simple empirical relation was initially
assumed to represent the time dependence of f(t), and the constants in this
expression have been determined from these boundary conditions. The BD
parameter has been found to have a negative value throughout the range of
study. The dependence of BD parameter upon the scalar field has been depicted
graphically. A smooth transition of the universe, from a decelerated to an
accelerated phase of expansion, is found to occur due to a conversion of matter
into dark energy. The gravitational constant is found to be increasing with
time.

Although it may be a subject of considerable debate, the core of his allegedly
wrong demurral was the insistence on finding an objective reality underlying
the manifestly bizarre behavior of quantum objects. The uncanny wave-particle
duality of a quantum particle is a prime example. In view of the latest
developments, particularly in quantum field theory, objections of Einstein are
substantially corroborated. Careful investigation suggests that a travelling
quantum particle is a holistic wave packet consisting of an assemblage of
irregular disturbances in quantum fields. It acts as a particle because only
the totality of all the disturbances in the wave packet yields the energy
momentum with the mass of a particle, along with its other conserved quantities
such as charge and spin. Thus the wave function representing a particle is not
just a fictitious mathematical construct but embodies a reality of nature as
asserted by Einstein.
