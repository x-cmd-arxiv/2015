  processes",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we obtain new drift-type conditions for nonexplosion and
explosion for nonhomogeneous Markov pure jump processes in Borel state spaces.
The conditions are sharp; e.g., the one for nonexplosion is necessary if the
state space is in addition locally compact and the $Q$-function satisfies weak
Feller-type and local boundedness conditions. We comment on the relations of
our conditions with the existing ones in the literature, and demonstrate some
possible applications.

multiple access channels (GMACs) with constant fading, multiple antennas and
various power constraints. The points of interest maximize general rate
objectives that arise in practical communication scenarios. Achieving these
points constitutes the task of jointly optimizing the time-sharing parameters,
the input covariance matrices and the order of decoding used by the successive
interference cancellation receiver. To approach this problem, Carath\'eodory's
theorem is invoked to represent time-sharing and decoding orders jointly as a
finite-dimensional matrix variable. This variable enables us to use variational
inequalities to extend results pertaining to problems with linear rate
objectives to more general, potentially nonconvex, problems, and to obtain a
necessary and sufficient condition for the optimality of the transmission
parameters in a wide range of problems. Using the insights gained from this
condition, we develop and analyze the convergence of an algorithm for solving,
otherwise daunting, GMAC-based optimization problems.

and thus thermoelectric efficiency. In order to investigate the scattering of
phonons in multilayer structures we developed a beam matching technique, which
is based on the concept of individual phonons and their scattering at
interfaces. One of the major goals is to efficiently determine the complex band
structure of the bulk materials. The complex band structure is determined using
selected k-points on a triangulated grid in the complex plane of wave vectors
perpendicular to the interface. Matching the phonon modes at an interface is
translated to a singular value problem. Its null-vectors provide the coupling
coefficients of the phonon modes across the interface. Besides giving explicit
access to the modes as they scatter at the interface, the technique provides
the transfer matrices, that provide the transmission coefficient of any
multilayer structure. The transmission coefficient, in turn, yields the
phononic thermal conductance for coherent transport. The knowledge of the
matched phonons forms the basis of investigating incoherent transport under the
influence of phonon-phonon or impurity scattering.

antiquarks under chiral transformations. We construct four spin-1/2 baryonic
multiplets from left- and right-handed quarks as well as left- and right-handed
diquarks. The fact that two of these multiplets transform in a ""mirror"" way
allows for chirally invariant mass terms. We then embed these baryonic
multiplets into the Lagrangian of the so-called extended Linear Sigma Model,
which features (pseudo)scalar and (axial-)vector mesons, as well as glueballs.
Reducing the Lagrangian to the two-flavor case, we obtain four doublets of
nucleonic states. These mix to produce four experimentally observed states with
definite parity: the positive-parity nucleon $N(939)$ and Roper resonance
$N(1440)$, as well as the negative-parity resonances $N(1535)$ and $N(1650)$.
We determine the parameters of the nucleonic part of the Lagrangian from a fit
to masses and decay properties of the aforementioned states. Studying the limit
of vanishing quark condensate, we conclude that $N(939)$ and $N(1535)$, as well
as $N(1440)$ and $N(1650)$ form pairs of chiral partners.

properties that are absent in extended graphene. For example, quantum
confinement in carbon nanotubes and armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) leads
to the opening of substantial electronic band gaps that are directly linked to
their structural boundary conditions. Even more intriguing are nanostructures
with zigzag edges, which are expected to host spin-polarized electronic edge
states and can thus serve as key elements for graphene-based spintronics. The
most prominent example is zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) for which the
edge states are predicted to couple ferromagnetically along the edge and
antiferromagnetically between them. So far, a direct observation of the
spin-polarized edge states for specifically designed and controlled zigzag edge
topologies has not been achieved. This is mainly due to the limited precision
of current top-down approaches, which results in poorly defined edge
structures. Bottom-up fabrication approaches, on the other hand, were so far
only successfully applied to the growth of AGNRs and related structures. Here,
we describe the successful bottom-up synthesis of ZGNRs, which are fabricated
by the surface-assisted colligation and cyclodehydrogenation of specifically
designed precursor monomers including carbon groups that yield atomically
precise zigzag edges. Using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy we prove the
existence of edge-localized states with large energy splittings. We expect that
the availability of ZGNRs will finally allow the characterization of their
predicted spin-related properties such as spin confinement and filtering, and
ultimately add the spin degree of freedom to graphene-based circuitry.

of a neural network as a categorical distribution conditioned on the inputs.
The output must therefore be positive and sum to one, which is traditionally
enforced by a softmax. This probabilistic mapping allows to use the maximum
likelihood principle, which leads to the well-known log-softmax loss. However
the choice of the softmax function seems somehow arbitrary as there are many
other possible normalizing functions. It is thus unclear why the log-softmax
loss would perform better than other loss alternatives. In particular Vincent
et al. (2015) recently introduced a class of loss functions, called the
spherical family, for which there exists an efficient algorithm to compute the
updates of the output weights irrespective of the output size. In this paper,
we explore several loss functions from this family as possible alternatives to
the traditional log-softmax. In particular, we focus our investigation on
spherical bounds of the log-softmax loss and on two spherical log-likelihood
losses, namely the log-Spherical Softmax suggested by Vincent et al. (2015) and
the log-Taylor Softmax that we introduce. Although these alternatives do not
yield as good results as the log-softmax loss on two language modeling tasks,
they surprisingly outperform it in our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10,
suggesting that they might be relevant in a broad range of applications.

development of handcrafted local features and learning based features. These
two architectures were proposed roughly at the same time and have flourished at
overlapping stages of history. However, they are typically viewed as distinct
approaches. In this paper, we emphasize their structural similarities and show
how such a unified view helps us in designing features that balance efficiency
and effectiveness. As an example, we study the problem of designing efficient

  We approach this problem by first showing that local handcrafted features and
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) share the same convolution-pooling network
structure. We then propose a two-stream Convolutional ISA (ConvISA) that adopts
the convolution-pooling structure of the state-of-the-art handcrafted video
feature with greater modeling capacities and a cost-effective training
algorithm. Through custom designed network structures for pixels and optical
flow, our method also reflects distinctive characteristics of these two data
sources.
  Our experimental results on standard action recognition benchmarks show that
by focusing on the structure of CNNs, rather than end-to-end training methods,
we are able to design an efficient and powerful video feature learning
algorithm.

top of face detection but from different face detectors. In this paper, we

set of images, i.e., area under error distribution curve within a threshold,
AUC$_\alpha$, given the fact that the traditional evaluation measure (mean
error) is very sensitive to big alignment error. 2) we extend the 300W database

a result, the best previous lower bound for general (possibly adaptive)

semantics for Reo coordination language. It is an extension of B\""uchi
automaton by using a set of records as its alphabet or transition labels.
Records are used to express the synchrony between the externally visible
actions of coordinated components modeled by BARs. The main composition
operator on the set of BARs is called as join which is the semantics of its
counterpart in Reo. In this paper, we define the notion of labeled transition
systems of records as a generalization of the notion of BAR, abstracting away
from acceptance or rejection of strings. Then, we consider four equivalence
relations (semantics) over the set of labeled transition systems of records and
investigate their congruency with respect to the join composition operator. In

nondeterministic finite automata (NFA)-based equivalence relations all are
congruence relations over the set of all labeled transition systems of records
with respect to the join operation. However, the equivalence relation using
B\""uchi acceptance condition is not so. In addition, using these results, we

composed of a mixture of small cells that are configured in either in-band or
out-of-band backhaul modes with a certain probability. The performance of the
user in the considered hierarchical network is limited by several sources of
interference such as the backhaul interference, small cell base station
(SBS)-to-SBS interference and the SI. Moreover, due to the channel hardening
effect in massive MIMO, the backhaul links experience long term channel effects
only, whereas the access links experience both the long term and short term
channel effects. Consequently, the developed framework is flexible to
characterize different sources of interference while capturing the
heterogeneity of the access and backhaul channels. In specific scenarios, the
framework enables deriving closed-form coverage probability expressions. Under
perfect backhaul coverage, the simplified expressions are utilized to optimize
the proportion of in-band and out-of-band small cells in the SCN in

its interior is the strongly stable core of a long $\mathbb C^n$; in
particular, biholomorphically nonequivalent sets give rise to nonequivalent
long $\mathbb C^n$'s. Furthermore, for any open set $U\subset \mathbb C^n$
there exists a long $\mathbb C^n$ whose stable core is dense in $U$. It follows
that for any $n>1$ there is a continuum of pairwise nonequivalent long $\mathbb
C^n$'s with no nonconstant plurisubharmonic functions and no nontrivial
holomorphic automorphisms. These results answer several long standing open
problems.

a mixture of latent domains can better represent the complex and diverse

discovered with Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in an unsupervised manner. These
are used to adapt DNNs using the Unique Binary Code (UBIC) representation for
the LDA domains. Experiments conducted on a set of BBC TV broadcasts, with more
than 2,000 shows for training and 47 shows for testing, show that the use of

principled, flexible technique for capturing neuronal diversity and thus
implicitly enforcing regularization. This enables effective auto-tuning of
network architecture and leads to smaller network sizes without hurting
performance. Moreover, through its focus on diversity and neuron fusing, Divnet
remains compatible with other procedures that seek to reduce memory footprints

be useful for policy making, especially now that policy makers are utilizing
citation-based indicators to evaluate people, institutions and laboratories.
Determining the accuracy of a taxonomy, however, remains a challenge. Previous
work on the accuracy of partition solutions is sparse, and the results of those
studies, while useful, have not been definitive. In this study we compare the
accuracies of topic-level taxonomies based on the clustering of documents using
direct citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation. Using a set of new
gold standards - articles with at least 100 references - we find that direct
citation is better at concentrating references than either bibliographic
coupling or co-citation. Using the assumption that higher concentrations of
references denote more accurate clusters, direct citation thus provides a more
accurate representation of the taxonomy of scientific and technical knowledge
than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. We also find that
discipline-level taxonomies based on journal schema are highly inaccurate
compared to topic-level taxonomies, and recommend against their use.

growing interest in developing methodologies to understand and visualize the

encode the visual information is a fundamental question both for computer and
human vision research. Image representations provided by the first
convolutional layer as well as the resolution change provided by the
max-polling operation are easy to understand, however, as soon as a second and
further convolutional layers are added in the representation, any intuition is
lost. A usual way to deal with this problem has been to define deconvolutional
networks that somehow allow to explore the internal representations of the most
important activations towards the image space, where deconvolution is assumed
as a convolution with the transposed filter. However, this assumption is not
the best approximation of an inverse convolution. In this paper we propose a
new assumption based on filter substitution to reverse the encoding of a
convolutional layer. This provides us with a new tool to directly visualize any
CNN single neuron as a filter in the first layer, this is in terms of the image
space.

or grain boundary diffusion that dominates in the compounds, and that frozen
bulk diffusion leads to unique composition characteristics quite distinct from

the remarkable interplay, accelerating in the last few decades, between
topology and the theory of orderable groups, with applications in both
directions.
  It begins with an introduction to orderable groups and their algebraic
properties. Many of the algebraic results are proved by topological methods,
via consideration of the space of orderings. After a discussion H\""older's
theorem and some dynamical aspects of orderable groups, we provide explicit
orderings of important groups in topology: free groups and most surface groups.
  Next we consider orderability of the fundamental groups of three-dimensional
manifolds. All knot groups, and more generally groups of 3-manifolds with
positive first Betti number are left-orderable, in fact locally indicable and
sometimes even bi-orderable. However when the first homology is finite the
situation is more subtle, and we find connections with foliations, branched
coverings, surgery, and conjecturally Heegaard-Floer homology.
  Braid groups are considered in some detail, including Dehornoy's ordering of
the braid groups and its later generalizations due to Thurston. This is
followed by a discussion of recent applications of Dehornoy's ordering to knot
theory. A short chapter outlines a proof that the group of PL homeomorphisms of
the $n$-dimensional cube (fixed on the boundary) is left-orderable; a property
conjectured to be true for the group of homeomorphisms in dimension two.
  We present a new proof that local indicability of a group is equivalent to
the existence of a ""Conradian"" left-ordering. A final chapter considers the
space $LO(G)$ of left-orderings of a group $G$. We give a new proof of Sikora's
theorem that $LO(\mathbb{Z}^n), n >1$ is a Cantor set, as well as a proof of
Linnell's theorem that for any group $G$, $LO(G)$ is either finite or
uncountable.

coupling constants appropriate for YBCO. We find that $\alpha$ has a minimum at
optimal doping and increases strongly (slightly) towards the underdoped
(overdoped) region. Using values for the electron phonon interaction from the
local density approximation we get good agreement for $\alpha$ as a function of
$T_c$ and doping $\delta$ with recent experimental data in YBCO. Our results
strongly suggest that the large increase of $\alpha$ in the underdoped region
is (a) caused by the shift of electronic spectral density from low to high
energies associated with a competing phase (in our case a charge density wave)
and the formation of a gap, and (b) compatible with the small electron phonon
coupling constants obtained from the local density approximation. We propose a
similar explanation for the anomalous behavior of $\alpha$ in Sr doped
La$_2$CuO$_4$ near the doping 1/8.

intersection of vision and language challenging. But language also provides a
strong prior that can result in good superficial performance, without the
underlying models truly understanding the visual content. This can hinder
progress in pushing state of art in the computer vision aspects of multi-modal
AI. In this paper, we address binary Visual Question Answering (VQA) on
abstract scenes. We formulate this problem as visual verification of concepts
inquired in the questions. Specifically, we convert the question to a tuple
that concisely summarizes the visual concept to be detected in the image. If
the concept can be found in the image, the answer to the question is ""yes"", and
otherwise ""no"". Abstract scenes play two roles (1) They allow us to focus on
the high-level semantics of the VQA task as opposed to the low-level
recognition problems, and perhaps more importantly, (2) They provide us the
modality to balance the dataset such that language priors are controlled, and
the role of vision is essential. In particular, we collect fine-grained pairs
of scenes for every question, such that the answer to the question is ""yes"" for
one scene, and ""no"" for the other for the exact same question. Indeed, language
priors alone do not perform better than chance on our balanced dataset.
Moreover, our proposed approach matches the performance of a state-of-the-art
VQA approach on the unbalanced dataset, and outperforms it on the balanced
dataset.

renewed interest for generative models of text and of images. However, even
today it is unclear what objective functions one should use to train and
evaluate these models. In this paper we present two contributions.
  Firstly, we present a critique of scheduled sampling, a state-of-the-art
training method that contributed to the winning entry to the MSCOCO image
captioning benchmark in 2015. Here we show that despite this impressive
empirical performance, the objective function underlying scheduled sampling is
improper and leads to an inconsistent learning algorithm.
  Secondly, we revisit the problems that scheduled sampling was meant to
address, and present an alternative interpretation. We argue that maximum
likelihood is an inappropriate training objective when the end-goal is to
generate natural-looking samples. We go on to derive an ideal objective
function to use in this situation instead. We introduce a generalisation of
adversarial training, and show how such method can interpolate between maximum
likelihood training and our ideal training objective. To our knowledge this is
the first theoretical analysis that explains why adversarial training tends to
produce samples with higher perceived quality.

from data, are all concerned with identifying effective and consistent fits of
unknown geometric loci to random data points. A geometric locus is a curve or
surface formed by points, all of which possess some uniform property. A
geometric locus of an algebraic equation is the set of points whose coordinates
are solutions of the equation. Any given curve or surface must pass through
each point on a specified locus. This paper argues that it is impossible to fit
random data points to algebraic equations of partially configured geometric
loci that reference arbitrary Cartesian coordinate systems. It also argues that
the fundamental curve of a linear decision boundary is actually a principal
eigenaxis. It is shown that learning principal eigenaxes of linear decision
boundaries involves finding a point of statistical equilibrium for which
eigenenergies of principal eigenaxis components are symmetrically balanced with
each other. It is demonstrated that learning linear decision boundaries
involves strong duality relationships between a statistical eigenlocus of
principal eigenaxis components and its algebraic forms, in primal and dual,
correlated Hilbert spaces. Locus equations are introduced and developed that
describe principal eigen-coordinate systems for lines, planes, and hyperplanes.
These equations are used to introduce and develop primal and dual statistical
eigenlocus equations of principal eigenaxes of linear decision boundaries.
Important generalizations for linear decision boundaries are shown to be
encoded within a dual statistical eigenlocus of principal eigenaxis components.
Principal eigenaxes of linear decision boundaries are shown to encode Bayes'
likelihood ratio for common covariance data and a robust likelihood ratio for
all other data.

taking place by ""strictly following the climate shift"". In the so-called
{\itenvironmental gradient case}, or {\it unconfined case}, we additionally
determine the propagation speedof the population when it survives: thanks to a
combination of migration and evolution, it can here be different from the speed
of the climate shift. Finally, we consider {\it mixed scenarios}, that are
complex situations, where thegrowth function satisfies the conditions of the
confined case on the right, and the conditions of the unconfined case on the

the use of classical methods based on comparison arguments. This difficulty is
overcome thanks to estimates on the tails of the solution, and a careful
application of the parabolic Harnack inequality.

transport through a Voronoi tessellation in the photoionisation and dust

on which previous work is based, which remapped hydrodynamical density fields
onto Cartesian grids before performing radiative transfer/photoionisation

tracing photon energy packets through a Voronoi tessellation, including
optimisations, treating problematic cases and boundary conditions. We perform
various benchmarks using both the original version of MOCASSIN and the modified

two redshift intervals: $1.5 \le z_{\rm ph} < 2.1$ and $z_{\rm ph}\ge 2.1$. A
statistically significant signal was found for both bins, indicating a
substantial increase with redshift of the bias parameter: $b=2.89\pm0.23$ for

two sampling strategies that consist in selecting a small subset of nodes at

results. Indeed, no more than O(k log(k)) measurements are sufficient to ensure
an accurate and stable recovery of all k-bandlimited signals. This second

accurate reconstructions and that it is also stable to noise. Finally, we
conduct several experiments to test these techniques.

quantum corrections that spoil slow roll. A large number $N$ of light species
in the theory, which occur in many string constructions, can amplify these
problems. One might even worry that in a de Sitter background, light species
will lead to a violation of the covariant entropy bound at large $N$. If so,
requiring the validity of the covariant entropy bound could limit the number of
light species and their couplings, which in turn could severely constrain
axion-driven inflation. Here we show that there is no such problem when we
correctly renormalize models with many light species, taking the {\it physical}
Planck scale to be $M^2_{pl} \gtrsim N {\cal M}_{UV}^2$, where ${\cal M}_{UV}$
is the cutoff for the QFT coupled to semiclassical quantum gravity. The number
of light species then cancels out of the gravitational entropy of de Sitter or
near-de Sitter backgrounds at leading order. Working in detail with $N$ scalar
fields in de Sitter space, renormalized to one loop order, we show that the
gravitational entropy automatically obeys the covariant entropy bound.
Furthermore, while the axion decay constant is a strong coupling scale for the
axion dynamics, we show that it is {\it not} in general the cutoff of 4d
semiclassical gravity. After renormalizing the two point function of the
inflaton, we note that it is also controlled by scales much below the cutoff.
We revisit $N$-flation and KKLT-type compactifications in this light, and show
that they are perfectly consistent with the covariant entropy bound. Thus,
while quantum gravity might yet spoil large field inflation, holographic
considerations in the semiclassical theory do not obstruct it.

consider the particular case of Sgr B2, one of the brightest and most massive
XRN in our Galaxy. We parametrise the gas distribution inside the cloud using a
simple clumping model, with the slope of the clump mass function (alpha), the
minimum clump mass (m_{min}), the fraction of the cloud's mass contained in
clumps (f_{DGMF}), and the mass-size relation of individual clumps as free
parameters, and investigate how these affect the reflected X-ray spectrum. In
the case of very dense clumps, similar to those presently observed in Sgr B2,
these occupy a small volume of the cloud and present a small projected area to
the incoming X-ray radiation. We find that these contribute negligibly to the
scattered X-rays. Clump populations with volume filling factors of > 10^{-3},
do leave observational signatures, that are sensitive to the clump model
parameters, in the reflected spectrum and polarisation. Future high-resolution
X-ray observations could therefore complement the traditional optical and radio
observations of these GMCs, and prove to be a powerful probe in the study of
their internal structure. Finally, clumps in GMCs should be visible both as
bright spots and regions of heavy absorption in high resolution X-ray

must be antigravity regions of spacetime connected to gravity regions through
gravitational singularities such as those that occur in black holes and

that unitarity is not violated but there may be an instability associated with
negative kinetic energies in the antigravity regions. In this paper we show
that the apparent problems can be resolved with the interpretation of the
theory from the perspective of observers strictly in the gravity region. Such
observers cannot experience the negative kinetic energy in antigravity
directly, but can only detect in and out signals that interact with the
antigravity region. This is no different than a spacetime black box for which
the information about its interior is encoded in scattering amplitudes for
in/out states at its exterior. Through examples we show that negative kinetic
energy in antigravity presents no problems of principles but is an interesting
topic for physical investigations of fundamental significance.

perform a detailed analysis on gas kinematics as manifested by the velocity
dispersion and shift of the [O III] {\lambda}5007 emission line, using a large
sample of ~39,000 type 2 AGNs at z<0.3. First, we confirm a broad correlation
between [O III] and stellar velocity dispersions, indicating that the bulge
gravitational potential plays a main role in determining the [O III]
kinematics. However, [O III] velocity dispersion is on average larger than
stellar velocity dispersion by a factor of 1.3-1.4 for AGNs with double
Gaussian [O III], suggesting that the non-gravitational component, i.e.,
outflows, is almost comparable to the gravitational component. Second, the
increase of the [O III] velocity dispersion (after normalized by stellar
velocity dispersion) with both AGN luminosity and Eddington ratio suggests that
non-gravitational kinematics are clearly linked to AGN accretion. The
distribution in the [O III] velocity - velocity dispersion diagram dramatically
expands toward large values with increasing AGN luminosity, implying that the
launching velocity of gas outflows increases with AGN luminosity. Third, the
majority of luminous AGNs presents the non-gravitational kinematics in the [O
III] profile. These results suggest that ionized gas outflows are prevalent
among type 2 AGNs. On the other hand, we find no strong trend of the [O III]
kinematics with radio luminosity, once we remove the effect of the bulge

universe that is initially expanding, highly inhomogeneous and dominated by

field variations are contained within a sufficiently flat region of the
inflaton potential, and the universe is spatially flat or open on average,
inflation will occur following the dilution of the gradient and kinetic energy
due to expansion. This is the case even when the scale of the inhomogeneities
is comparable to the initial Hubble length, and overdense regions collapse and
form black holes, because underdense regions continue expanding, allowing
inflation to eventually begin. This establishes that inflation can arise from
highly inhomogeneous initial conditions and solve the horizon and flatness
problems, at least as long as the variations in the scalar field do not include
values that exceed the inflationary plateau.

receiving a majority of its pressure support from the CR proton fluid. We
compare to recent observations of the CGM of L ~ L* galaxies at low redshift,
including UV absorption lines within background quasar spectra. The combination
of metal-enriched, CR-driven winds and large swaths of CR pressure-supported,
cooler diffuse gas leads to a CGM that provides a better match to data from
COS-Halos (for HI, SiIV, CIII and OVI) than the non-CR run. We also compare our
models to recent, preliminary observations of diffuse gamma-ray emission in
local group halos. For our lower CR-diffusion runs with kappa_CR in the range
0.3 to 1 x 10^28 cm^2/s, the CR enriched CGM produces an inconsistently high

significance and without the occurrence of systematics. An average offset of a
factor ~1.5 exists between DL07- and MBB-based dust masses, based on consistent
dust properties. At the depth of the deepest Herschel surveys (in the GOODS-S

At higher redshift (z<=2) the same result is achieved only for objects at the

M(dust) through the metallicity-dependent gas-to-dust ratio delta(GDR), are
consistent with those based on the scaling of depletion time, and on CO

for direct-imaging planet searches. However, these types of stars are part of
multiple systems more often than not. Close stellar companions affect the
formation and orbital evolution of any planets, and the properties of the
companions can help constrain the binary formation mechanism. Unfortunately,
close companions are difficult and expensive to detect with imaging techniques.
In this paper, we describe the direct spectral detection method wherein a
high-resolution spectrum of the primary is cross-correlated against a template
for a companion star. Variants of this method have previously been used to
search for stellar, brown dwarf, and even planetary companions. We show that
the direct spectral detection method can detect companions as late as M-type
orbiting A0 or earlier primary stars in a single epoch on small-aperture
telescopes. In addition to estimating the detection limits, we determine the
sources of uncertainty in characterizing the companion temperature, and find
that large systematic biases can exist. After calibrating the systematic biases
with synthetic binary star observations, we apply the method to a sample of 34
known binary systems with an A- or B-type primary star. We detect nine total
companions, including four of the five known companions with literature
temperatures between $4000$ K $ < T < 6000$ K, the temperature range for which
our method is optimized. We additionally characterize the companion for the
first time in two previously single-lined binary systems and one binary
identified with speckle interferometry. This method provides an inexpensive way
to use small-aperture telescopes to detect binary companions with moderate
mass-ratios, and is competitive with high-resolution imaging techniques inside
$\sim 100-200$ mas.

Milky Way and gas mass fractions reaching 50 to 80%, i.e. gas masses 1 - 4

35 M_ mol^0.89 x (1+z)_{z=2}^0.95 x (sSFR)_{MS}^0.23 \msun yr^-1 -- an
approximately linear dependence on the ISM mass and an increased star formation
efficiency per unit gas mass at higher redshift. Galaxies above the Main
Sequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on
a timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS -- thus these
'starbursts' are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses
rather than and increased efficiency for converting gas to stars. At z $> 1$,
the entire population of star-forming galaxies has $\sim$ 2 - 5 times shorter
gas depletion times than low-z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate
a different mode of star formation in the early universe -- most likely
dynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions -- a natural
consequence of the high gas accretion rates.

that this enhancement is mass dependent: 91+/-9% of the M* >10^{10.5}Msun

whereas the fraction of quiescent galaxies with lower masses is the same in the
cluster and field environments. The presence of a dense core and a well-formed,

distant radio galaxies do not solely reside in young, uncollapsed

driving turbulence. Most of this energy is thermalized and immediately removed
from the ISM by radiative cooling. The rest is available for driving ISM
dynamics. In this work we estimate the amount of feedback energy retained as
kinetic energy when the bubble walls have decelerated to the sound speed of the
ambient medium. We show that the feedback of the most massive star outweighs
the feedback from less massive stars. For a giant molecular cloud (GMC) mass of
1e5 solar masses (as e.g. found in the Orion GMCs) and a star formation
efficiency of 8% the initial mass function predicts a most massive star of
approximately 60 solar masses. For this stellar evolution model we test the
dependence of the retained kinetic energy of the cold GMC gas on the inclusion
of stellar winds. In our model winds insert 2.34 times the energy of a SN and
create stellar wind bubbles serving as pressure reservoirs. We find that during
the pressure driven phases of the bubble evolution radiative losses peak near
the contact discontinuity (CD), and thus, the retained energy depends
critically on the scales of the mixing processes across the CD. Taking into
account the winds of massive stars increases the amount of kinetic energy
deposited in the cold ISM from 0.1% to a few percent of the feedback energy.

formation and critical to its climate. Previous studies using simulated
photometry of Earth show that continuous observations over most of a planet's
orbit can be inverted to infer obliquity. However, few studies of more general
planets with arbitrary albedo markings have been made and, in particular, a
simple theoretical understanding of why it is possible to extract obliquity
from light curves is missing. Reflected light seen by a distant observer is the
product of a planet's albedo map, its host star's illumination, and the
visibility of different regions. It is useful to treat the product of
illumination and visibility as the kernel of a convolution. Time-resolved
photometry constrains both the albedo map and the kernel, the latter of which
sweeps over the planet due to rotational and orbital motion. The kernel's
movement distinguishes prograde from retrograde rotation for planets with
non-zero obliquity on inclined orbits. We demonstrate that the kernel's
longitudinal width and mean latitude are distinct functions of obliquity and
axial orientation. Notably, we find that a planet's spin axis affects the
kernel -- and hence time-resolved photometry -- even if this planet is
East-West uniform or spinning rapidly, or if it is North-South uniform. We find
that perfect knowledge of the kernel at 2-4 orbital phases is usually
sufficient to uniquely determine a planet's spin axis. Surprisingly, we predict
that East-West albedo contrast is more useful for constraining obliquity than
North-South contrast.

infrared galaxies identified by the WISE mission from their very red mid-IR
colors, and characterized by hot dust temperatures ($T>60~\rm K$). Several
studies have shown clear evidence that the IR emission in these objects is
powered by a highly dust-obscured AGN that shows close to Compton-thick
absorption at X-ray wavelengths. Thanks to the high AGN obscuration, the host
galaxy is easily observable, and has UV/optical colors usually consistent with
those of a normal galaxy. Here we discuss a sub-population of 8 Hot DOGs that
show enhanced rest-frame UV/optical emission. We discuss three scenarios that
might explain the excess UV emission: (i) unobscured light leaked from the AGN
by reflection over the dust or by partial coverage of the accretion disk; (ii)
a second unobscured AGN in the system; or (iii) a luminous young starburst.
X-ray observations can help discriminate between these scenarios. We study in
detail the blue excess Hot DOG WISE J020446.13-050640.8, which was
serendipitously observed by Chandra/ACIS-I for 174.5 ks. The X-ray spectrum is
consistent with a single, hyper-luminous, highly absorbed AGN, and is strongly
inconsistent with the presence of a secondary unobscured AGN. Based on this, we
argue that the excess blue emission in this object is most likely either due to
reflection or a co-eval starburst. We favor the reflection scenario as the
unobscured star-formation rate needed to power the UV/optical emission would be
$\gtrsim 1000~\rm M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$. Deep polarimetry observations could
confirm the reflection hypothesis.

both in terms of angular size and total integrated flux. Planck's wide angular
scale and frequency coverage, together with its high sensitivity, allow a
detailed study of this large object through the SZ effect. Virgo is well
resolved by Planck, showing an elongated structure, which correlates well with
the morphology observed from X-rays, but extends beyond the observed X-ray
signal. We find a good agreement between the SZ signal (or Compton paranmeter,
y_c) observed by Planck and the expected signal inferred from X-ray
observations and simple analytical models. Due to its proximity to us, the gas
beyond the virial radius can be studied with unprecedented sensitivity by
integrating the SZ signal over tens of square degrees. We study the signal in
the outskirts of Virgo and compare it with analytical models and a constrained
simulation of the environment of Virgo. Planck data suggest that significant
amounts of low-density plasma surround Virgo out to twice the virial radius. We
find the SZ signal in the outskirts of Virgo to be consistent with a simple
model that extrapolates the inferred pressure at lower radii while assuming
that the temperature stays in the keV range beyond the virial radius. The
observed signal is also consistent with simulations and points to a shallow
pressure profile in the outskirts of the cluster. This reservoir of gas at
large radii can be linked with the hottest phase of the elusive warm/hot
intergalactic medium. Taking the lack of symmetry of Virgo into account, we
find that a prolate model is favoured by the combination of SZ and X-ray data,
in agreement with predictions.

provides a physically well-motivated idealisation of atomic nuclei and nuclear
matter: 1) it leads to zero binding energies for classical solitons (while
realistic binding energies emerge owing to the semiclassical corrections, the
Coulomb interaction and isospin breaking); 2) it describes a perfect
non-barotropic fluid already at the microscopic (field theoretical) level which
allows to study thermodynamics beyond the mean-field limit. These properties
allow for an approximate but analytical calculation of binding energies of the
most abundant nuclei, for a determination of the equation of state of
skyrmionic matter (both in the full field theory and in a mean-field
approximation) as well as the description of neutron stars as Skyrme solitons
with a very good agreement with available observational data. All these results
suggest that the proper low energy effective model of QCD should be close to
the BPS Skyrme model in a certain sense (a ""near-BPS Skyrme model""), with a
prominent role played by the BPS part.

nearly orthogonal components, a host galaxy (HG) and a polar ring/disk (PR).
The HG usually contains an older stellar population than the PR. The suggested
formation channel of PRGs is still poorly constrained. Suggested options are
merger, gas accretion, tidal interaction, or a combination of both. To
constrain the formation scenario of PRGs, we study the compact stellar systems
(CSSs) in two PRGs at different evolutionary stages: NGC 4650A with
well-defined PR, and NGC 3808B, which is in the process of PR formation. We use
archival HST/WFPC2 imaging. PSF-fitting techniques, and color selection
criteria are used to select cluster candidates. Photometric analysis of the
CSSs was performed to determine their ages and masses using stellar population
models at a fixed metallicity. Both PRGs contain young CSSs ($< 1$ Gyr) with
masses of up to 5$\times$10$^6$M$_\odot$, mostly located in the PR and along
the tidal debris. The most massive CSSs may be progenitors of metal-rich
globular clusters or ultra compact dwarf (UCD) galaxies. We identify one such
young UCD candidate, NGC 3808 B-8, and measure its size of $r_{\rm
eff}=25.23^{+1.43}_{-2.01}$ pc. We reconstruct the star formation history of
the two PRGs and find strong peaks in the star formation rate (SFR $\simeq$
200M$_\odot$/yr) in NGC 3808B, while NGC 4650A shows milder (declining) star
formation (SFR $<$ 10M$_\odot$/yr). This difference may support different
evolutionary paths between these PRGs. The spatial distribution, masses, and
peak star formation epoch of the clusters in NGC 3808 suggest for a tidally
triggered star formation. Incompleteness at old ages prevents us from probing
the SFR at earlier epochs of NGC 4650A, where we observe the fading tail of CSS
formation. This also impedes us from testing the formation scenarios of this
PRG.

capability in exploiting the nonlinearity of samples, we utilize the merits of
both local metric learning and deep neural network to learn multiple sets of

exoplanets are useful to strongly constrain theoretical models of planet
formation and evolution, which lead to the large variety of exoplanets and
planetary-system configurations that have been observed. We present a study of
the planetary systems WASP-45 and WASP-46, both composed of a main-sequence
star and a close-in hot Jupiter, based on 29 new high-quality light curves of
transits events. In particular, one transit of WASP-45 b and four of WASP-46 b
were simultaneously observed in four optical filters, while one transit of
WASP-46 b was observed with the NTT obtaining precision of 0.30 mmag with a
cadence of roughly three minutes. We also obtained five new spectra of WASP-45
with the FEROS spectrograph. We improved by a factor of four the measurement of
the radius of the planet WASP-45 b, and found that WASP-46 b is slightly less
massive and smaller than previously reported. Both planets now have a more
accurate measurement of the density (0.959 +\- 0.077 \rho Jup instead of 0.64
+\- 0.30 \rho Jup for WASP-45 b, and 1.103 +\- 0.052 \rho Jup instead of 0.94
+\- 0.11 \rho Jup for WASP-46 b). We tentatively detected radius variations
with wavelength for both planets, in particular in the case of WASP-45 b we
found a slightly larger absorption in the redder bands than in the bluer ones.
No hints for the presence of an additional planetary companion in the two
systems were found either from the photometric or radial velocity measurements.

  Under the condition that $K$ is the potential density of a transient Markov

  $(X_{t_{1}},\ldots,X_{t_{n}})$ is represented as a random mixture of
  $n$-dimensional random variables with components that are independent gamma
random variables. This representation leads to a Sudakov type inequality for
the sup-norm of $(X_{t_{1}},\ldots,X_{t_{n}})$ that is used to obtain
sufficient conditions for a large class of permanental processes to be
unbounded almost surely. These results are used to obtain conditions for
permanental processes associated with certain L\'evy processes to be unbounded.
  Because $K$ is the potential density of a transient Markov process, for all

where the verifier is given a 3SAT formula, but has only oracle access to an
assignment and a proof. The verifier accepts a satisfying assignment with a
valid proof, and rejects (with high enough probability) an assignment that is
far from all satisfying assignments (for any given proof).
  In this work, we focus on the type of computation the verifier is allowed to
make. Assuming P $\neq$ NP, there can be no PCPP when the verifier is only
allowed to answer according to constraints from a set that forms a CSP that is
solvable in P. Therefore, the notion of PCPP is relaxed to almost perfect
probabilistically checkable proofs of proximity (APPCPP), where the verifier is
allowed to reject a satisfying assignment with a valid proof, with arbitrary
small probability.
  We show, unconditionally, a dichotomy of sets of allowable computations: sets
that have APPCPPs (which actually follows because they have PCPPs) and sets
that do not. This dichotomy turns out to be the same as that of the Dichotomy
Theorem, which can be thought of as dividing sets of allowable verifier
computations into sets that give rise to NP-hard CSPs, and sets that give rise
to CSPs that are solvable in P.

derive the past existence of deleted data.
  Fortunately, history independence can be utilized to eliminate such

over mechanical disk drives. However, HIFS cannot provide history independence
when deployed on top of flash devices, as flash memory manages its own internal
block placement, which is often inherently history dependent.
  In this work, we initiate research on history independent flash devices. We
design HiFlash, which achieves a strong notion of history independence by
defending against an adversary allowed access to the flash at multiple
different points in time. In addition, we design a simple, yet history
independence friendly wear-leveling mechanism that allows HiFlash to smartly
and advantageously trade off a tunable small amount of history leakage for a
significant increase in the device's lifetime. Our prototype built in an actual

beyond the commonly used Born-Markov approximations to incorporate

effects. We obtain energy transfer dynamics for both underdamped and overdamped

hierarchical equations of motion over a wide range of parameters. Furthermore,
we show that the Zusman equations, which may be obtained in a semiclassical
limit of the reaction coordinate model, are often incapable of describing the
correct dynamical behaviour. This demonstrates the necessity of properly
accounting for quantum correlations generated between the system and its
environment when the Born-Markov approximations no longer hold. Finally, we
apply the reaction coordinate formalism to the case of a structured environment
comprising of both underdamped (i.e. sharply peaked) and overdamped (broad)

  Regression Models",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning accurate probabilistic models from data is crucial in many practical
tasks in data mining. In this paper we present a new non-parametric calibration
method called \textit{ensemble of near isotonic regression} (ENIR). The method
can be considered as an extension of BBQ, a recently proposed calibration
method, as well as the commonly used calibration method based on isotonic
regression. ENIR is designed to address the key limitation of isotonic
regression which is the monotonicity assumption of the predictions. Similar to
BBQ, the method post-processes the output of a binary classifier to obtain
calibrated probabilities. Thus it can be combined with many existing
classification models. We demonstrate the performance of ENIR on synthetic and
real datasets for the commonly used binary classification models. Experimental
results show that the method outperforms several common binary classifier
calibration methods. In particular on the real data, ENIR commonly performs
statistically significantly better than the other methods, and never worse. It
is able to improve the calibration power of classifiers, while retaining their
discrimination power. The method is also computationally tractable for large
scale datasets, as it is $O(N \log N)$ time, where $N$ is the number of
samples.

Gauss-Newton method and sparsity promoting regularization based on fixed
multiscale transforms that permit significant subsampling of the seismic data
when the model perturbation at each FWI data-fitting iteration can be
represented with sparse coefficients. Rather than using analytical transforms
with predefined dictionaries to achieve sparse representation, we introduce an
adaptive transform called the Sparse Orthonormal Transform (SOT) whose
dictionary is learned from many small training patches taken from the model
perturbations in previous iterations. The patch-based dictionary is constrained
to be orthonormal and trained with an online approach to provide the best
sparse representation of the complex features and variations of the entire

the cube of the number of samples in one small patch. By incorporating both
compressive subsampling and the adaptive SOT-based representation into the
Gauss-Newton least-squares problem for each FWI iteration, the model

on the SOT coefficients. Numerical experiments on synthetic models demonstrate
that the SOT-based sparsity promoting regularization can provide robust FWI

connections to other agents, but also incur costs for forming links. We
consider a new network formation game that incorporates an adversarial attack,
as well as immunization against attack. An agent's benefit is the expected size
of her connected component post-attack, and agents may also choose to immunize
themselves from attack at some additional cost. Our framework is a stylized
model of settings where reachability rather than centrality is the primary
concern and vertices vulnerable to attacks may reduce risk via costly measures.
  In the reachability benefit model without attack or immunization, the set of
equilibria is the empty graph and any tree. The introduction of attack and
immunization changes the game dramatically; new equilibrium topologies emerge,
some more sparse and some more dense than trees. We show that, under a mild
assumption on the adversary, every equilibrium network with $n$ agents contains
at most $2n-4$ edges for $n\geq 4$. So despite permitting topologies denser
than trees, the amount of overbuilding is limited. We also show that attack and
immunization don't significantly erode social welfare: every non-trivial
equilibrium with respect to several adversaries has welfare at least as that of
any equilibrium in the attack-free model.
  We complement our theory with simulations demonstrating fast convergence of a
new bounded rationality dynamic which generalizes linkstable best response but
is considerably more powerful in our game. The simulations further elucidate
the wide variety of asymmetric equilibria and demonstrate topological
consequences of the dynamics e.g. heavy-tailed degree distributions. Finally,
we report on a behavioral experiment on our game with over 100 participants,
where despite the complexity of the game, the resulting network was
surprisingly close to equilibrium.

core mass functions, IMF/DCMF) are among the key factors regulating star
formation and are the subject of detailed theoretical and observational
studies. Results from numerical simulations of star formation qualitatively
resemble an observed mass function, a scale-free power law with a sharp decline
at low masses. However, most analytic IMF theories critically depend on the
empirically chosen input spectrum of mass fluctuations which evolve into dense
cores and, subsequently, stars, and on the scaling relation between the
amplitude and mass of a fluctuation. Here we propose a new approach exploiting
the techniques from the field of network science. We represent a system of
dense cores accreting gas from the surrounding diffuse interstellar medium
(ISM) as a spatial network growing by preferential attachment and assume that
the ISM density has a self-similar fractal distribution following the
Kolmogorov turbulence theory. We effectively combine gravoturbulent and
competitive accretion approaches and predict the accretion rate to be
proportional to the dense core mass: $dM/dt \propto M$. Then we describe the
dense core growth and demonstrate that the power-law core mass function emerges
independently of the initial distribution of density fluctuations by mass. Our
model yields a power law solely defined by the fractal dimensionalities of the
ISM and accreting gas. With a proper choice of the low-mass cut-off, it
reproduces observations over three decades in mass. We also rule out a low-mass
star dominated ""bottom-heavy"" IMF in a single star-forming region.

alignment and semantics-aware dynamic representation, must be taken into
account. In this paper, we attempt to solve both problems via manifold modeling
of videos based on a novel mid-level representation, i.e.
\textbf{expressionlet}. Specifically, our method contains three key stages: 1)
each expression video clip is characterized as a spatial-temporal manifold
(STM) formed by dense low-level features; 2) a Universal Manifold Model (UMM)
is learned over all low-level features and represented as a set of local modes
to statistically unify all the STMs. 3) the local modes on each STM can be
instantiated by fitting to UMM, and the corresponding expressionlet is
constructed by modeling the variations in each local mode. With above strategy,
expression videos are naturally aligned both spatially and temporally. To
enhance the discriminative power, the expressionlet-based STM representation is
further processed with discriminant embedding. Our method is evaluated on four
public expression databases, CK+, MMI, Oulu-CASIA, and FERA. In all cases, our

sky. Since its accidental detection in 1968, its pulsed emission has been
observed throughout most of the electromagnetic spectrum. Although currently
one of more than 2000 known pulsars, its way of work has remained not
understood making the Crab pulsar an object of continuous studies and interest.
Referring to the pulsed emission of the Crab pulsar only at radio wavelengths,
it reveals a diversity of different phenomena. They range from deviations of
the predicted slowing down process of the pulsar with time (long time
phenomena) to an irregularity of its single pulse emission (short time
phenomena). Similar and different kinds of deviations are observed at other
wavelengths. Consequently, the Crab pulsar provides a large diversity of
different emission characteristics which have remained difficult to interpret
with a uniform theoretical approach including all observed properties. Since a
review of all currently examined properties of the Crab pulsar is beyond the
scope of this paper, its goal is to give an overview of previous studies of the
Crab pulsar predominantly at radio and gamma-wavelengths with an emphasis on a
possible connection to its radio single pulse emission. A discussion of a
possible identification of common emission mechanisms is given.

involves pseudo-random projections followed by nonlinear (sign function)
mappings. The pseudo-random projection is described by a matrix, where not all
entries are independent random variables but instead a fixed ""budget of
randomness"" is distributed across the matrix. Such matrices can be efficiently
stored in sub-quadratic or even linear space, provide reduction in randomness
usage (i.e. number of required random values), and very often lead to
computational speed ups. We prove several theoretical results showing that
projections via various structured matrices followed by nonlinear mappings
accurately preserve the angular distance between input high-dimensional
vectors. To the best of our knowledge, these results are the first that give
theoretical ground for the use of general structured matrices in the nonlinear
setting. In particular, they generalize previous extensions of the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and prove the plausibility of the approach that was
so far only heuristically confirmed for some special structured matrices.
Consequently, we show that many structured matrices can be used as an efficient
information compression mechanism. Our findings build a better understanding of
certain deep architectures, which contain randomly weighted and untrained
layers, and yet achieve high performance on different learning tasks. We
empirically verify our theoretical findings and show the dependence of learning
via structured hashed projections on the performance of neural network as well
as nearest neighbor classifier.

what are the right questions to ask. Instead, the analyst typically needs to
use the data to search for interesting analyses to perform and hypotheses to
test. This is an adaptive process, where the choice of analysis to be performed
next depends on the results of the previous analyses on the same data.
Ultimately, which results are reported can be heavily influenced by the data.
It is widely recognized that this process, even if well-intentioned, can lead
to biases and false discoveries, contributing to the crisis of reproducibility
in science. But while %the adaptive nature of exploration any data-exploration
renders standard statistical theory invalid, experience suggests that different
types of exploratory analysis can lead to disparate levels of bias, and the
degree of bias also depends on the particulars of the data set. In this paper,
we propose a general information usage framework to quantify and provably bound
the bias and other error metrics of an arbitrary exploratory analysis. We prove
that our mutual information based bound is tight in natural settings, and then
use it to give rigorous insights into when commonly used procedures do or do
not lead to substantially biased estimation. Through the lens of information
usage, we analyze the bias of specific exploration procedures such as
filtering, rank selection and clustering. Our general framework also naturally
motivates randomization techniques that provably reduces exploration bias while
preserving the utility of the data analysis. We discuss the connections between
our approach and related ideas from differential privacy and blinded data
analysis, and supplement our results with illustrative simulations.

Identifiability analysis addresses the question of whether it is possible to

experimental inputs. Here we explore the structural identifiability properties
of a generalized form of HH from voltage clamp data. Through a scaling
argument, we conclude that the steady-state gating variables are not
identifiable from voltage clamp data, and then further show that their product
together with the conductance term forms an identifiable combination. We
additionally show that these parameters become identifiable when the initial
conditions for each of the gating variables are known. The time constants for
each gating variable are shown to be identifiable, and a novel method for
estimating them is presented. Finally, the exponents of the gating variables
are shown to be identifiable in the two-gate case, and we conjecture these to
be identifiable in the general case. These results are broadly applicable to
models using HH-like formalisms, and show in general which parameters and

1.6 years) which indicates a variety of variability properties during different
intervals of observation. The normalized excess variance, $F_{\rm var}$ ranges
from 1.8 % in the quiescent phase and 43.3 % in the outburst phase. We find no
significant deviation from linearity in the $F_{\rm var}$-flux relation. Time
series analysis is conducted using the Fourier power spectrum and the wavelet
analysis methods to study the power spectral density (PSD) shape, infer
characteristic timescales and statistically significant quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs). A bending power law with an associated timescale of $T_B =
6.2^{+6.4}_{-3.1}$ hours is inferred in the PSD analysis. We obtain a black
hole mass of $M_\bullet = (1.5 - 5.9) \times 10^7 M_\odot$ for the first time
using $F_{\rm var}$ and the bend timescale for this source. From a mean
outburst lifetime of days, we infer a distance from the jet base $r \leq 1.75$
pc indicating that the outburst originates due to a shock. A possible QPO
peaked at 9.1 days and lasting 3.4 cycles is inferred from the wavelet
analysis. Assuming that the QPO is a true feature, $r = (152 - 378)~ G
M_\bullet/c^2$ and supported by the other timing analysis products such as a
weighted mean PSD slope of $-1.5 \pm 0.2$ from the PSD analysis, we argue that
the observed variability and the weak and short duration QPO could be due to
jet based processes including orbital features in a relativistic helical jet
and others such as shocks and turbulence.

joint image and language understanding to answer a question about a given
photograph. Recent approaches have applied deep image captioning methods based
on convolutional-recurrent networks to this problem, but have failed to model
spatial inference. To remedy this, we propose a model we call the Spatial
Memory Network and apply it to the VQA task. Memory networks are recurrent
neural networks with an explicit attention mechanism that selects certain parts
of the information stored in memory. Our Spatial Memory Network stores neuron
activations from different spatial regions of the image in its memory, and uses
the question to choose relevant regions for computing the answer, a process of
which constitutes a single ""hop"" in the network. We propose a novel spatial
attention architecture that aligns words with image patches in the first hop,
and obtain improved results by adding a second attention hop which considers
the whole question to choose visual evidence based on the results of the first
hop. To better understand the inference process learned by the network, we
design synthetic questions that specifically require spatial inference and
visualize the attention weights. We evaluate our model on two published visual
question answering datasets, DAQUAR [1] and VQA [2], and obtain improved
results compared to a strong deep baseline model (iBOWIMG) which concatenates
image and question features to predict the answer [3].

  Theorem Let $\Gamma$ be a non-bipartite distance-regular graph with valency
$k \geq 3$ , diameter $D \geq 3$ and distinct eigenvalues $\theta_0 > \theta_1
> \cdots > \theta_D$. Suppose that $\Gamma$ is $2$-bounded with smallest

continuously reduced from 2.3 K (x=0) to ~1.4 K (x=0.07) by doping Zn, and then
the AFM order with the transition temperature of T_N~2.2 K develops for x
larger than ~0.05. The present thermal, transport and magnetic measurements
under magnetic field B reveal that the substitution of Zn for In yields little
change of low-temperature upper critical field \mu_0H_{c2} for both the
tetragonal a and c axes, while it monotonically reduces the SC transition
temperature T_c. In particular, the magnitudes of \mu_0H_{c2} at the nominal Zn
concentration of x = 0.05 (measured Zn amount of ~0.019) are 11.8 T for B||a
and 4.8 T for B||c, which are as large as those of pure compound though T_c is
reduced to 80% of that for x=0. We consider that this feature originates from a
combination of both an enhanced AFM correlation and a reduced SC condensation
energy in these alloys. It is also clarified that the AFM order differently
responds to the magnetic field, depending on the field directions. For B||c,
the clear anomaly due to the AFM transition is observed up to the AFM critical
field of ~5 T in the thermodynamic quantities, whereas it is rapidly damped
with increasing B for B||a. We discuss this anisotropic response on the basis

simulations, it is essential to provide guidance for what values of $P_z$ the
quasi-PDFs are good approximations of standard PDFs. Within the framework of
the spectator diquark model, we evaluate both the up and down quarks'
quasi-PDFs and standard PDFs for all leading-twist distributions (unpolarized
distribution $f_1$, helicity distribution $g_1$, and transversity distribution
$h_1$). We find that, for intermediate parton momentum fractions $x$,
quasi-PDFs are good approximations to standard PDFs (within $20-30\%$) when
$P_z\gtrsim 1.5-2$ GeV. On the other hand, for large $x\sim 1$ much larger $P_z

Several new facet-defining Bell inequalities for the {[3 3 3] [3 3 3]} scenario
are obtained with their quantum violations analyzed in details. Surprisingly,
all these inequalities involving only genuine ternary-outcome measurements can
be violated maximally by some two-qubit entangled states, such as the maximally
entangled two-qubit state. This gives further evidence that in analyzing the
quantum violation of Bell inequalities, or in the application of the latter to
device-independent quantum information processing tasks, the commonly-held
wisdom of equating the local Hilbert space dimension of the optimal state with
the number of measurement outcomes is not necessarily justifiable. In addition,
when restricted to the minimal qubit subspace, it can be shown that one of
these Bell inequalities requires non-projective measurements to attain maximal
quantum violation, thereby giving the first example of a facet-defining Bell
inequality where a genuine positive-operator-valued measure is relevant. We
experimentally demonstrate the quantum violation of this and two other Bell
inequalities for this scenario using energy-time entangled photon pairs. Using
the obtained measurement statistics, we demonstrate how characterization of the
underlying resource in the spirit of device-independence, but supplemented with
auxiliary assumptions, can be achieved. In particular, we discuss how one may
get around the fact that, due to finite-size effects, raw measurement
statistics typically violate the non-signaling condition.

probability of the field. The idea is to integrate out the external bath of
particles by computing the reduced density matrix of the system. Following this
approach, we derive an explicit correction factor in the specific case of
scalar particle production in flat spacetime. In this given framework, we
conclude that the backreaction is ultraviolet finite and enhances the decay
rate. Moreover, in the weak production limit, the backreaction factor is
directly given by one half of the total number of created particles. In order
to estimate the importance of this correction, we apply our formalism to a toy
model potential which allows us to consider both the decay of a homogeneous
bounce and the nucleation of a thin-wall bubble. In the former case, the impact
of the created particles is parameter dependent and we exhibit a reasonable
choice of variables for which ones the backreaction is significant. In the
latter case, we conclude that the backreaction is always negligible.

Although it has been established with clear assumptions for geometric planners,

difficult, if not impossible, to verify on practical systems. In this paper, we
focus on an important class of kinodynamic planners, namely those that
interpolate trajectories in the state space. We provide a proof of
probabilistic completeness for these planners under assumptions that can be
readily verified from the system's equations of motion and the user-defined
interpolation function. Our proof relies crucially on a property of
interpolated trajectories, termed second-order continuity (SOC), which we show
is tightly related to the ability of a planner to benefit from denser sampling.
We analyze the impact of this property in simulations on a low-torque pendulum.
Our results show that a simple RRT using a second-order continuous
interpolation swiftly finds solution, while it is impossible for the same
planner using standard Bezier curves (which are not SOC) to find any solution.

applications. Since the nuclear norm approximates the rank by adding all
singular values together, which is essentially a $\ell_1$-norm of the singular

and to alleviate the above-mentioned limitations of the nuclear norm, we
propose a nonconvex rank approximation. This approximation to the matrix rank

another coalition that leads to lower individual payments. We quantify the
inefficiency of distributed decision-making processes under a cost-sharing
mechanism by the strong price of anarchy (SPoA), comparing a worst-case stable
coalition structure and a social optimum. In particular, we derive SPoA for
common fair cost-sharing mechanisms (e.g., equal-split, proportional-split,
egalitarian and Nash bargaining solutions of bargaining games, and usage based
cost-sharing). We show that the SPoA for equal-split, proportional-split, and
usage based cost-sharing (under certain conditions) is $\Theta(\log K)$,
whereas the one for egalitarian and Nash bargaining solutions is $O(\sqrt{K}
\log K)$. Therefore, distributed decision-making processes under common fair
cost-sharing mechanisms induce only moderate inefficiency.

colour temperatures ~0.1 keV, bolometric luminosities ~ a few 10^39 erg/s, and
almost no emission above 1 keV. It has never been clear how they fit into the
general scheme of accreting compact objects. To address this problem, we
studied a sample of seven ULSs with extensive Chandra and XMM-Newton coverage.
We find an anticorrelation between fitted temperatures and radii of the thermal
emitter, and no correlation between bolometric luminosity and radius or
temperature. We compare the physical parameters of ULSs with those of classical
supersoft sources, thought to be surface-nuclear-burning white dwarfs, and of
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), thought to be super-Eddington stellar-mass
black holes. We argue that ULSs are the sub-class of ULXs seen through the
densest wind, perhaps an extension of the soft-ultraluminous regime. We suggest
that in ULSs, the massive disk outflow becomes effectively optically thick and
forms a large photosphere, shrouding the inner regions from our view. Our model
predicts that when the photosphere expands to >10,000 km and the temperature
decreases below approximately 50 eV, ULSs become brighter in the far-UV but
undetectable in X-rays. Conversely, we find that harder emission components
begin to appear in ULSs when the fitted size of the thermal emitter is smallest
(interpreted as a shrinking of the photosphere). The observed short-term
variability and absorption edges are also consistent with clumpy outflows. We
suggest that the transition between ULXs (with a harder tail) and ULSs (with
only a soft thermal component) occurs at blackbody temperatures of
approximately 150 eV.

to the challenges in spintronics: complex oxides and bismuth based materials.
We derive a general approach for constructing an effective spin-orbit
Hamiltonian, which applies to all nonmagnetic materials. We also verify this
formalism through comparisons with other approaches for III-V semiconductors.
Its general applicability is illustrated by deriving the spin-orbit interaction
and predicting spin lifetimes for strained SrTiO$_3$ and a two-dimensional
electron gas (such as at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface). Our results
suggest robust spin coherence and spin transport properties in SrTiO$_3$
related materials. In the second part, we calculate intrinsic spin Hall
conductivities for Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ semimetals with strong spin-orbit
couplings, from the Kubo formula and using Berry curvatures evaluated from a
tight-binding Hamiltonian. Nearly crossing bands with strong spin-orbit
interaction generate giant spin Hall conductivities in these materials, ranging
from 474 ($\hbar/e)( \Omega^{-1}cm^{-1}$) for bismuth to 96($\hbar/e)(
\Omega^{-1}cm^{-1}$) for antimony; the value for bismuth is more than twice
that of platinum. The large spin Hall conductivities persist for alloy
compositions corresponding to a three-dimensional topological insulator state,
such as Bi$_{0.83}$Sb$_{0.17}$. The spin Hall conductivity could be changed by
a factor of 5 for doped Bi, or for Bi$_{0.83}$Sb$_{0.17}$, by changing the
chemical potential, suggesting the potential for doping or voltage tuned spin
Hall current. We also calculate intrinsic spin Hall conductivities of
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi$_2$Te$_3$ topological insulators from an effective
tight-binding Hamiltonian. We conclude that bismuth-antimony alloys and bismuth
chalcogenides are primary candidates for efficiently generating spin currents
through the spin Hall effect.

whether the difference in distances measured with SNIa data and BAO data can be
reduced in such a model. We also constrain the BD theory and cosmological

evidence for the engineered Dirac nodes in the bosonic excitations: the spectra
of the collective bosonic modes cross at the K and K points in the Brillouin
zone and form Dirac nodes. We show how two different types of collective phase
oscillations are obtained and that they are analogous to the Leggett and the
Bogoliubov-Anderson-Gorkov modes in a two-band superconductor. We show that the
Dirac node is preserved in the presence of an inter-grain interaction, despite
induced changes of the qualitative features of the two collective modes.
Finally, breaking the sublattice symmetry by choosing different on-site
potentials for the two sublattices leads to a gap opening near the Dirac node,
in analogy with Fermionic Dirac materials. Dirac node dispersion of bosonic
excitations is thus expanding the discussion of the conventional Dirac cone
excitations to the case of bosons. We call this case as a representative of
Bosonic Dirac Materials (BDM), similar to the case of Fermionic Dirac materials

hydrides based on evolutionary algorithm method and particle swarm optimization
algorithm method. Given only rich-hydrogen region, except for BiH$_{3}$, other
hydrides (BiH, BiH$_{2}$, BiH$_{4}$, BiH$_{5}$, BiH$_{6}$) have been predicted
to be stable with pressurization. With the increase of hydrogen content,
hydrogen exists in bismuth hydrides with the different forms and presents the
characteristics of ionicity. Under high pressure, the remarkable structural
feature is the emergence of H$_{2}$ units in BiH$_{2}$, BiH$_{4}$ and
BiH$_{6}$, and BiH$_{6}$ adopts a startling layered structure intercalated by
H$_{2}$ and the linear H$_{3}$ units. Further calculations show these
energetically stable hydrides are good metal and their metallic pressures are
lower than that of pure solid hydrogen because of the doping impurities. The
$T_{c}$ in the range of 20-119 K has been calculated by the Allen-Dynes
modified McMillan equation, which indicates all these stable hydrides are
potential high-temperature superconductors. Remarkably, it is the H-Bi-H and Bi
atoms vibrations rather than the high-frequency H$_{2}$ or H$_{3}$ units that
dominate the superconductivity. In addition, hydrogen content has a great
influence on the superconducting transition temperature.

lead to the eventual purification of the emitted radiation. It follows that the
late radiation has to be entangled with the early radiation and, as a
consequence, the entanglement among the Hawking pair partners has to decrease
continuously from maximal to vanishing during the BH's life span. Starting from
the basic premise that both the horizon radius and the center of mass of a
finite-mass BH are fluctuating quantum mechanically, we show how this process
is realized. First, it is shown that the horizon fluctuations induce a small
amount of variance in the total linear momentum of each created pair. This is
in contrast to the case of an infinitely massive BH, for which the total
momentum of the produced pair vanishes exactly on account of momentum
conservation. This variance leads to a random recoil of the BH during each
emission and, as a result, the center of mass of the BH undergoes a quantum
random walk. Consequently, the uncertainty in its momentum grows as the square
root of the number of emissions. We then show that this uncertainty controls
the amount of deviation from maximal entanglement of the produced pairs and
that this deviation is determined by the ratio of the cumulative number of
emitted particles to the initial BH entropy. Thus, the interplay between the
horizon and center-of-mass fluctuations provides a mechanism for teleporting
entanglement from the pair partners to the BH and the emitted radiation.

globular proteins of approximately 1.5 nm radius, into the mesoporous silica
material Santa Barbara Amorphous-15 (SBA-15) with 3.3 nm mean pore radius has
been studied photometrically for aqueous solutions containing a single protein
type and for binary protein mixtures. Distinct variations in the absolute and
relative adsorption behavior are observed as a function of the solution's
pH-value, and thus pore wall and protein charge. The proteins exhibit the
strongest binding below their isoelectric points pI, which indicates the
dominance of electrostatic interactions between charged amino acid residues and
the -OH groups of the silica surface in the mesopore adsorption process.
Moreover, we find for competitive adsorption in the restricted, tubular pore
geometry that the protein type which shows the favoured binding to the pore
wall can entirely suppress the adsorption of the species with lower binding
affinity, even though the latter would adsorb quite well from a single
component mixture devoid of the strongly binding protein. We suggest that this
different physicochemical behavior along with the large specific surface and
thus adsorption capability of mesoporous glasses can be exploited for
separation of binary mixtures of proteins with distinct pI by adjusting the
aqueous solution's pH.

dimensions the latter symmetry can lead to a finite-temperature Ising
transition, associated with (quasi) phase locking between the atoms and the

Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition towards quasi-condensation of
atoms or molecules. The existence of the two transitions is found to depend
crucially on the population imbalance (or detuning) between atoms and
molecules: when the molecules are majority in the system, their BKT
quasi-condensation transition occurs at a higher temperature than that of the
atoms; the latter has the unconventional nature of an Ising (quasi)
phase-locking transition, lacking a finite local order parameter below the
critical temperature. When the balance is gradually biased towards the atoms,
the two transitions merge together to leave out a unique BKT transition, at
which both atoms and molecules acquire quasi-long-range correlations, but only
atoms exhibit conventional BKT criticality, with binding of vortex-antivortex
pairs into short-range dipoles. The molecular vortex-antivortex excitations
bind as well, but undergo a marked crossover from a high-temperature regime in

of Bianchi IX gravitational instantons. By exploiting a parametrization of the
gravitational instantons in terms of theta functions with characteristics, we
show that each Seeley-de Witt coefficient $\tilde a_{2n}$ appearing in the

cases of metrics with pairs of rational parameters that belong to two different

stellar objects is often based on models with a smooth and continuous density
distribution. However, spatially resolved observations with increasing angular
resolution and dynamical models indicate that circumstellar disks are
highlystructured.
  Aims. We investigate the influence of different clumpy density distributions
on selected physical properties and observable characteristics of circumstellar
disks.
  Methods. Based on radiative transfer modelling we calculate the temperature
structure of the disk and simulate observational quantities in the thermal
re-emission and scattering regime. We compare our results to those obtained for
a smooth and continuous density distribution to quantify the influence of
clumps on physical parameters and observable quantities of circumstellar disks.
  Results. Within the considered model space, the clumpiness has a significant
impact on the disk temperature distribution. For instance, in the transition
region from the upper disk layers to the disk interior, it causes a decrease of
the mean temperature by up to 12 K. In addition, circumstellar disks with
clumpy density distributions feature a lower spectral index in the submm/mm
range of the SED. As a consequence of the lower spectral index, the dust grain
size derived from the submm/mm-slope of the SED may be overestimated, if the
inhomogeneity of the disk density distribution is not taken into account.
Furthermore, the scattered light brightness distribution of clumpy disks shows
a steeper radial decrease. Additionally, clumpy density distributions change
the degree of polarization of the scattered light in the optical.

cycle of hydrogen burning. This cycle affects the synthesis of the elements
between $^{20}$Ne and $^{27}$Al in asymptotic giant branch stars and novae. The
$^{22}$Ne(p,$\gamma$)$^{23}$Na reaction rate is very uncertain because of a
large number of unobserved resonances lying in the Gamow window. At proton
energies below 400\,keV, only upper limits exist in the literature for the
resonance strengths. Previous reaction rate evaluations differ by large
factors. In the present work, the first direct observations of the
$^{22}$Ne(p,$\gamma$)$^{23}$Na resonances at 156.2, 189.5, and 259.7\,keV are
reported. Their resonance strengths have been derived with 2-7\% uncertainty.
In addition, upper limits for three other resonances have been greatly reduced.
Data were taken using a windowless $^{22}$Ne gas target and high-purity
germanium detectors at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics in
the Gran Sasso laboratory of the National Institute for Nuclear Physics, Italy,
taking advantage of the ultra-low background observed deep underground. The new
reaction rate is a factor of 5 higher than the recent evaluation at
temperatures relevant to novae and asymptotic giant branch stars
nucleosynthesis.

Since exact modeling of these phenomena requires access to their microscopic

effective SDEs describing the behavior of systems in the limits when natural
time scales became very small. In the presence of multiplicative noise (i.e.,
noise whose intensity depends upon the system's state), an additional drift
term, called noise-induced drift, appears. The nature of this noise-induced

experimental studies. Here, we provide an extensive review of the state of the

several case studies with a focus on recent experiments: Brownian motion of a
microscopic particle in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath in the presence of
a diffusion gradient, and the limiting behavior of a system driven by a colored
noise modulated by a multiplicative feedback. This allows us to present the
experimental results, as well as mathematical methods and numerical techniques

of the shock and affects the spectra of particles accelerated through the
first-order Fermi mechanism. This phenomenon has profound implications for the
interpretation of the multifrequency spectra of radiation from supernova
remnants. Neutrals that undergo charge exchange with hot ions downstream of the
shock may result in fast neutrals moving towards the upstream gas, where they
can suffer additional charge exchange or ionisation reactions, thereby
depositing energy and momentum upstream. Here we discuss the implications of
this neutral return flux, which was already predicted in our previous work on
neutral mediated supernova shocks, and show how the spectra of accelerated
particles turn out to be appreciably steeper than $p^{-4}$, thereby affecting
the gamma ray spectra from supernova remnants in general and from Tycho
specifically. The theory that describes non-linear diffusive shock acceleration
in the presence of neutral hydrogen has been developed in recent years. Here we
use a semi-analytical theory developed in previous work and specialise our
predictions to the case of the Tycho supernova shock, where there is evidence
that the spectrum of the accelerated cosmic rays is steeper than expected from
the traditional theory of diffusive shock acceleration. We show that, if the
fraction of neutral hydrogen in the vicinity of the Tycho supernova shock is,
as suggested by observations, ~70-90, then spectra of accelerated protons
steeper than $p^{-4}$ may be a natural consequence of charge exchange reactions
and the associated neutral return flux. The spectral shape is affected by this
phenomenon for particles with energies below ~100-1000 GeV, for which the
diffusion length is less than or at most comparable to the pathlength of charge
exchange and ionisation upstream of the shock.

Universally given that the universe is permeated by a dark energy fluid,
therefore, we should also investigate the astrophysical scale properties from
the dark energy effects. In the present paper, the exact solutions of
spherically-symmetrical Einstein field equations describing wormholes supported
by phantom energy that violates the null energy condition from Shan-Chen fluid
description are obtained. We have considered the important case that the model
parameter $\psi\approx1$ which corresponds to the `` saturation effect "", and
this regime corresponds to an effective form of `` asymptotic freedom "" for the
fluids, but occurring at cosmological rather than subnuclear scales. Then we
investigate the allowed range values of the model parameters $g$ and $\omega$

singularities of the solutions, finding that the obtained spacetimes are

matching our obtained interior solutions to the exterior Schwarzschild

evaluation of the two-loop threshold corrections to electroweak quantities,
such as the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. However, these
divergences are an artifact of perturbation theory, and therefore need to be
consistently resummed in order to obtain a IR-safe effective potential. The
so-called Two-Particle-Irreducible (2PI) effective action provides a rigorous
framework to consistently perform such resummations, without the need to resort
to ad hoc subtractions or running into the risk of over-counting contributions.

Ia) could play a role in its maximum luminosity, as suggested by theoretical
predictions. We present an observational study to investigate if such a
relationship there exists. Using the 4.2m WHT we have obtained
intermediate-resolution spectroscopy data of a sample of 28 local galaxies
hosting SNe Ia, for which distances have been derived using methods independent
to those based on the own SN Ia parameters. From the emission lines observed in
their optical spectrum, we derived the gas-phase oxygen abundance in the region
where each SN Ia exploded. Our data show a trend, with a 80% of chance not to
be due to random fluctuation, between SNe Ia absolute magnitudes and the oxygen
abundances of the host galaxies, in the sense that luminosities tend to be
higher for galaxies with lower metallicities. This result seems like to be in
agreement with both the theoretically expected behavior, and with other
observational results. This dependence $M_{B}$-Z might induce to systematic
errors when is not considered in deriving SNe Ia luminosities and then using
them to derive cosmological distances.

and the message is used to specify a code from the ensemble of codes. Then, we
show that the introduction of artificial noise in ANA-MACs can be well employed
to resist the key recovery attack even if the opponent has an unlimited

specimens to examine the similarity of the somatic characteristics of the
tumors and to test for clonal relatedness. As the landscape of mutation testing
has evolved, a number of statistical methods for determining clonality have
developed, notably for comparing losses of heterozygosity at candidate markers,
and for comparing copy number profiles. Increasingly tumors are being evaluated
for point mutations in panels of candidate genes using gene sequencing
technologies. Comparison of the mutational profiles of pairs of tumors presents
unusual methodological challenges: mutations at some loci are much more common
than others; knowledge of the marginal mutation probabilities is scanty for
most loci at which mutations might occur; the sample space of potential
mutational profiles is vast. We examine this problem and propose a test for
clonal relatedness of a pair of tumors from a single patient. Using
simulations, its properties are shown to be promising. The method is
illustrated using several examples from the literature.

proposed to solve the problem of large-scale anomaly detection. It is a

So the graphene membrane could be used as an antenna or a transistor. It was

could be tuned in a rather large frequency range 1-100 terahertz as electrons

optimization of an expensive-to-evaluate fitness function. BO typically assumes
that computation cost of BO is cheap, but experiments are time consuming or
costly. In practice, this allows us to optimize ten or fewer critical
parameters in up to 1,000 experiments. But experiments may be less expensive
than BO methods assume: In some simulation models, we may be able to conduct
multiple thousands of experiments in a few hours, and the computational burden

challenge we introduce a new Dimension Scheduling Algorithm (DSA), which
reduces the computational burden of BO for many experiments. The key idea is
that DSA optimizes the fitness function only along a small set of dimensions at
each iteration. This DSA strategy (1) reduces the necessary computation time,
(2) finds good solutions faster than the traditional BO method, and (3) can be
parallelized straightforwardly. We evaluate the DSA in the context of

constraints, such as those from the DM relic density, the LUX experiment and
the Higgs searches at colliders. Then for the surviving samples, we simulate
the $2l+E_T^{miss}$ signal from slepton pair production process and the
$2l+E_T^{miss}$ and $3l+E_T^{miss}$ signals from chargino and neutralino
associated production processes at both the 8 TeV LHC and the 14 TeV LHC. Our

Document level Continuous Bag of Weighted Words (D-CBOW2). Both these models
take document words as input and learn with an objective to maximise the
retrieval of co-occurring OOV PNs. With the D-CBOW2 model we propose a new
approach in which the input embedding layer is augmented with a context anchor
layer. This layer learns to assign importance to input words and has the
ability to capture (task specific) key-words in a bag-of-word neural network
model. With experiments on French broadcast news videos we show that these two
models outperform the baseline methods based on raw embeddings from LDA,
Skip-gram and Paragraph Vectors. Combining the D-CBOW and D-CBOW2 models gives
faster convergence during training.

populations. Traditionally, many of the selection-based processes used to
describe cultural and genetic evolution (such as imitation and birth-death
models) have been studied on a case-by-case basis. Over time, these models have
grown in sophistication to include population structure, differing phenotypes,
and various forms of interaction asymmetry, among other features. Furthermore,
many processes inspired by natural selection, such as evolutionary algorithms
in computer science, possess characteristics that should fall within the realm
of a ""selection process,"" but so far there is no overarching theory
encompassing these evolutionary processes. The framework of $\textit{stochastic
selection processes}$ we present here provides such a theory and consists of
three main components: a $\textit{population state space}$, an
$\textit{aggregate payoff function}$, and an $\textit{update rule}$. A
population state space is a generalization of the notion of population
structure, and it can include non-spatial information such as strategy-mutation
rates and phenotypes. An aggregate payoff function allows one to generically
talk about the fitness of traits without explicitly specifying a method of
payoff accounting or even the nature of the interactions that determine
payoff/fitness. An update rule is a fitness-based function that updates a
population based on its current state, and it includes as special cases the
classical update mechanisms (Moran, Wright-Fisher, etc.) as well as more
complicated mechanisms involving chromosomal crossover, mutation, and even
complex cultural syntheses of strategies of neighboring individuals. Our
framework covers models with variable population size as well as with
arbitrary, measurable trait spaces.

countable sequence of terms in a suitable expansion. MISC is a combination
technique based on mixed differences of spatial approximations and quadratures
over the space of random data and, naturally, the error analysis uses the joint
regularity of the solution with respect to both the variables in the physical

performed at each discretization level is not determined by balancing the
spatial and stochastic components of the error, but rather by suitably
extending the knapsack-problem approach employed in the construction of the
quasi-optimal sparse-grids and Multi-index Monte Carlo methods. We use a greedy
optimization procedure to select the most effective mixed differences to
include in the MISC estimator. We apply our theoretical estimates to a linear

field, with a covariance similar to a Mat\'ern model, whose realizations have
spatial regularity determined by a scalar parameter. We conduct a complexity
analysis based on a summability argument showing algebraic rates of convergence

on the smoothness parameter, the physical dimensionality and the efficiency of
the linear solver. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of MISC in this

all-to-all couplings. A rigorous mean-field analysis is implemented to predict
the possible steady states. Furthermore, a detailed linear stability analysis
proves that the incoherent state is only neutrally stable below the
synchronization threshold. Nevertheless, interestingly, the amplitude of the
order parameter decays exponentially (at least for short time) in this regime,
resembling the Landau damping effect in plasma physics. Moreover, the explicit
expression for the critical coupling strength is determined by both the
mean-field method and linear operator theory. The mechanism of bifurcation for
the incoherent state near the critical point is further revealed by the
amplitude expansion theory, which shows that the oscillating standing wave
state could also occur in this model for certain frequency distributions. Our
theoretical analysis and numerical results are consistent with each other,
which can help us understand the synchronization transition in general networks

clustering or dependence of epidemiological traits in networks, but researchers
disagree about whether data from RDS studies can reveal it. Two distinct
mechanisms account for dependence in traits of recruiters and recruitees in an
RDS study: homophily, the tendency for individuals to share social ties with
others exhibiting similar characteristics, and preferential recruitment, in
which recruiters do not recruit uniformly at random from their available
alters. The different effects of network homophily and preferential recruitment
in RDS studies have been a source of confusion in methodological research on
RDS, and in empirical studies of the social context of health risk in hidden
populations. In this paper, we give rigorous definitions of homophily and
preferential recruitment and show that neither can be measured precisely in
general RDS studies. We derive nonparametric identification regions for
homophily and preferential recruitment and show that these parameters are not
point identified unless the network takes a degenerate form. The results
indicate that claims of homophily or recruitment bias measured from empirical
RDS studies may not be credible. We apply our identification results to a study

tree $T$ for which $BBC_2(G,T)=\chi(G)$, if $\chi(G)\ge 4$, or
$BBC_2(G,T)=\chi(G)+1$, otherwise. Thus, by applying the Four Color Theorem, we
have that every connected nonbipartite planar graph $G$ has a spanning tree $T$

between spatially resolved H$\alpha$ kinematics and Ly$\alpha$ photometry can
be conjectured. However, no general trend can be established for the whole
sample. Furthermore, we compute non-parametric global kinematical statistics --
intrinsic velocity dispersion $\sigma_0$, shearing velocity $v_\mathrm{shear}$,
and the $v_\mathrm{shear}/\sigma_0$ ratio -- from our kinematic maps. In
general LARS galaxies are characterised by high intrinsic velocity dispersions
(54\,km\,s$^{-1}$ median) and low shearing velocities (65\,km\,s$^{-1}$
median). $v_\mathrm{shear}/\sigma_0$ values range from 0.5 to 3.2 with an
average of 1.5. Noteworthy, five galaxies of the sample are dispersion
dominated systems with $v_\mathrm{shear}/\sigma_0 <1$ and are thus
kinematically similar to turbulent star forming galaxies seen at high redshift.
When linking our kinematical statistics to the global LARS Ly$\alpha$
properties, we find that dispersion dominated systems show higher Ly$\alpha$
equivalent widths and higher Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions than systems with
$v_\mathrm{shear}/\sigma_0 > 1$. Our result indicates that turbulence in
actively star-forming systems is causally connected to interstellar medium
conditions that favour an escape of Ly$\alpha$ radiation.

The fast delivery control is formulated as a two-stage functional non-convex

certain substitution rules. For a given self-similar set, finding such rules is
somehow mysterious, and it is the main concern of the present paper. Our first
idea is to introduce the notion of skeleton for a self-similar set. Then, from
a skeleton, we construct several graphs, define edge-to-trail substitution
rules, and explore conditions ensuring the rules lead to space-filling curves.
Thirdly, we summarize the classical constructions of the space-filling curves
into two classes: the traveling-trail class and the positive Euler-tour class.
Finally, we propose a general Euler-tour method, using which we show that if a
self-similar set satisfies the open set condition and possesses a skeleton,
then space-filling curves can be constructed. Especially, all connected
self-similar sets of finite type fall into this class. Our study actually
provides an algorithm to construct space-filling curves of self-similar sets.

bipartization number of a graph, which is known to be MaxSNP hard, and connect
the computation of the classical value of more general XOR-d games to the

physical properties of objects from photometric information alone. These
estimates are needed to automatically identify interesting objects worth a
follow-up investigation as well as to produce the required data for a
statistical analysis of the space covered by a survey. We argue that machine
learning techniques are suitable to compute these estimates accurately and
efficiently. This study promotes a feature selection algorithm, which selects
the most informative magnitudes and colours for a given task of estimating
physical quantities from photometric data alone. Using k nearest neighbours
regression, a well-known non-parametric machine learning method, we show that
using the found features significantly increases the accuracy of the
estimations compared to using standard features and standard methods. We
illustrate the usefulness of the approach by estimating specific star formation
rates (sSFRs) and redshifts (photo-z's) using only the broad-band photometry
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For estimating sSFRs, we demonstrate
that our method produces better estimates than traditional spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting. For estimating photo-z's, we show that our method
produces more accurate photo-z's than the method employed by SDSS. The study
highlights the general importance of performing proper model selection to
improve the results of machine learning systems and how feature selection can
provide insights into the predictive relevance of particular input features.

has been pursued in various settings including wavelet denoising, generalized
linear models and low-rank matrix estimation. By thresholding some parameters
to zero, estimators such as lasso, elastic net and subset selection allow to
perform not only parameter estimation but also variable selection, leading to
sparsity. Yet one crucial step challenges all these estimators: the choice of
the threshold parameter~$\lambda$. If too large, important features are
missing; if too small, incorrect features are included.
  Within a unified framework, we propose a new selection of $\lambda$ at the
detection edge under the null model. To that aim, we introduce the concept of a
zero-thresholding function and a null-thresholding statistic, that we
explicitly derive for a large class of estimators. The new approach has the
great advantage of transforming the selection of $\lambda$ from an unknown
scale to a probabilistic scale with the simple selection of a probability
level. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our approach in terms of
model selection and prediction.

constant on the solid torus with arbitrary metric fluctuations on the boundary.
To this end we employ the discrete approach of (quantum) Regge calculus. In
contrast with similar calculations performed directly in the continuum, we work
with a boundary at finite distance from the torus axis. We show that after
taking the continuum limit on the boundary - but still keeping finite distance
from the torus axis - the one-loop correction is the same as the one recently
found in the continuum in Barnich et al. for an asymptotically flat boundary.
The discrete approach taken here allows to identify the boundary degrees of
freedom which are responsible for the non-trivial structure of the one-loop
correction. We therefore calculate also the Hamilton-Jacobi function to
quadratic order in the boundary fluctuations both in the discrete set-up and
directly in the continuum theory. We identify a dual boundary field theory with
a Liouville type coupling to the boundary metric. The discrete set-up allows
again to identify the dual field with degrees of freedom associated to radial
bulk edges attached to the boundary. Integrating out this dual field reproduces
the (boundary diffeomorphism invariant part of the) quadratic order of the
Hamilton-Jacobi functional. The considerations here show that bulk boundary
dualities might also emerge at finite boundaries and moreover that discrete
approaches are helpful in identifying such dualities.

maximum velocities agreed. We fitted mass-follows-light models to 163 galaxies
by approximating the radial starlight profile as nested, very flattened mass
homeoids viewed as a S\'ersic form. Fitting broad-band SEDs to SDSS images gave
median stellar mass/light 1.7 assuming a Kroupa IMF vs. 2.6 dynamically.
Two-thirds of the dynamical mass/light measures were consistent with
star+remnant IMFs. One-fifth required upscaled starlight to fit, hence
comparable mass of unobserved baryons and/or DM distributed similarly across
the SAMI aperture that came to dominate motions as the starlight CSC declined
rapidly. The rest had mass distributed differently from starlight. Subtracting
fits of S\'ersic profiles to 13 VIKING Z-band images revealed residual weak
bars. Near the bar PA, we assessed m = 2 streaming velocities, and found
deviations usually <30 km/s from the CSC; three showed no deviation. Thus,

decay of the lightest modulus in the sequestered LARGE Volume Scenario. We
discuss several cases depending on the form of the Kahler metric for visible
sector matter fields and the mechanism responsible for achieving a de Sitter
vacuum. The leading decay channels which determine dark radiation predictions
are to hidden sector axions, visible sector Higgses and SUSY scalars depending
on their mass. We show that in most of the parameter space of split SUSY-like
models squarks and sleptons are heavier than the lightest modulus. Hence dark
radiation predictions previously obtained for MSSM-like cases hold more
generally also for split SUSY-like cases since the decay channel to SUSY
scalars is kinematically forbidden. However the inclusion of string loop
corrections to the Kahler potential gives rise to a parameter space region
where the decay channel to SUSY scalars opens up, leading to a significant
reduction of dark radiation production. In this case, the simplest model with a
shift-symmetric Higgs sector can suppress the excess of dark radiation $\Delta
N_{eff}$ to values as small as 0.14, in perfect agreement with current
experimental bounds. Depending on the exact mass of the SUSY scalars all values
in the range 0.14 $\lesssim \Delta N_{eff} \lesssim$ 1.6 are allowed.
Interestingly dark radiation overproduction can be avoided also in the absence
of a Giudice-Masiero coupling.

plasmonics. Planar tripods of 8 nm Rh nanoparticles, synthesized by a modified
polyol reduction method, have a calculated local surface plasmon resonance near
330 nm. By attaching p-aminothiophenol, local field-enhanced Raman spectra and
accelerated photo-damage were observed under near-resonant ultraviolet
illumination, while charge transfer simultaneously increased fluorescence for
up to 13 minutes. The combined local field enhancement and charge transfer

where acceleration becomes zero but the velocity remains non-zero, is observed
in nonlinear dynamical systems. In this work we show whether a transformation
also maps the perpetual points to another system or not. We establish
mathematically that a linearly transformed system is topologicaly conjugate,
and hence does map the perpetual points. However, for a nonlinear
transformation, various other possibilities are also discussed. It is noticed
that under a linear diffeomorphic transformation, perpetual points are mapped,
and accordingly, eigenvalues are preserved.

controlling and manipulating generic information-processing systems. Here, we
show how topological amplification effects in scale-free networks of signaling
devices are optimally enhanced when the $\it{impulse}$ transmitted by periodic
external signals (time integral over two consecutive zeros) is maximum. This is
demonstrated theoretically by means of a star-like network of overdamped
bistable systems subjected to $\it{generic}$ zero-mean periodic signals, and
confirmed numerically by simulations of scale-free networks of such systems.
Our results show that the enhancer effect of increasing values of the signal's
impulse is due to a correlative increase of the energy transmitted by the
periodic signals, while it is found to be resonant-like with respect to the
topology-induced amplification mechanism.

  Cellular Networks",,,,,"cs.NI cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simultaneous co-channel transmission and reception, denoted as in-band full
duplex (FD) communication, has been promoted as an attractive solution to
improve the spectral efficiency of cellular networks. However, in addition to
the self-interference problem, cross-mode interference (i.e., between uplink
and downlink) imposes a major obstacle for the deployment of FD communication
in cellular networks. More specifically, the downlink to uplink interference
represents the performance bottleneck for FD operation due to the uplink
limited transmission power and venerable operation when compared to the
downlink counterpart. While the positive impact of FD communication to the
downlink performance has been proved in the literature, its effect on the
uplink transmission has been neglected. This paper focuses on the effect of
downlink interference on the uplink transmission in FD cellular networks in
order to see whether FD communication is beneficial for the uplink transmission
or not, and if yes for which type of network. To quantify the expected
performance gains, we derive a closed form expression of the maximum achievable
uplink capacity in FD cellular networks. In contrast to the downlink capacity
which always improves with FD communication, our results show that the uplink
performance may improve or degrade depending on the associated network
parameters. Particularly, we show that the intensity of base stations (BSs) has
a more prominent effect on the uplink performance than their transmission
power.

proposed based on angle resolved resonant photoemission and related diffraction
patterns, presented here for the first time via an ab-initio modified one-step
theory of photoemission. The analysis is done on the paradigmatic weak
itinerant ferromagnet bcc Fe, whose magnetism, seen as a correlation phenomenon
given by the coexistence of localized moments and itinerant electrons, and the
non-Fermi liquid behaviour at ambient and extreme conditions both remain
unclear. The results offer a real space imaging of local pure spin flip and
entangled spin flip-orbital flip excitations (even at energies where spin flip
transitions are hidden in quasiparticle peaks) and of chiral, vortex-like
wavefronts of excited electrons, depending on the orbital character of the
bands and the direction of the local magnetic moment. Such effects, mediated by
the hole polarization, make resonant photoemission a promising tool to perform
a full tomography of the local magnetic properties of a system with a high
sensitivity to localization/correlation, even in itinerant or macroscopically
non magnetic systems.
