fundamental parameters of a complete sample of 277 star clusters (SCs) of the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) observed in the Washington photometric system,
including 82 clusters very recently studied by us. All the clusters' parameters
such as radii, deprojected distances, reddenings, ages and metallicities have
been obtained by appyling essentially the same procedures which are briefly
described here. We have used empirical cumulative distribution functions to
examine age, metallicity and deprojected distance distributions for different
cluster subsamples of the catalogue. Our new sample made up of 82 additional
clusters recently studied by us represents about a 40% increase in the total
number of LMC SCs observed up to now in the Washington photometric system. In
particular, we report here the fundamental parameters obtained for the first
time for 42 of these clusters. We found that single LMC SCs are typically older
than multiple SCs. Both single and multiple SCs exhibit asymmetrical
distributions in log (age). We compared cluster ages derived through isochrone
fittings obtained using different models of the Padova group. Although $t_G$
and $t_B$ ages obtained using isochrones from Girardi et al. (2002) and Bressan
et al. (2012), respectively, are consistent in general terms, we found that
$t_B$ values are not only typically larger than $t_G$ ages but also that
Bressan et al.'s age uncertainties are clearly smaller than the corresponding
Girardi et al. values.

the diagonal 4-point correlation functions on the sphere. At large central
charge c, after exponentiation, it depends on two fixed ratios h_H/c and h_L/c,
where h_{H, L} are the conformal dimensions of the 4-point function operators.
The semiclassical block may be expanded in powers of the light ratio h_L/c and
the leading non-trivial (linear) order is known in closed form as a function of
h_H/c. Recently, this contribution has been matched against AdS_3 gravity
calculations where heavy operators build up a classical geometry corresponding
to a BTZ black hole, while the light operators are described by a geodesic in
this background. Here, we compute for the first time the next-to-leading
quadratic correction O((h_L/c)^{2}), again in closed form for generic heavy
operator ratio h_H/c. The result is a highly non-trivial extension of the
leading order and may be relevant for further refined AdS_{3}/CFT_{2} tests.
Applications to the two-interval R\'enyi entropy are also presented.

good match of their orbital elements, even though the comet's activity is not
strong enough to explain the number of observed meteors. Various small NEOs
have been discovered with orbits that can be linked to 2P and the Taurid
meteoroid stream. Maribo and Sutter's Mill are CM type carbonaceous chondrites
that fell in Denmark on Jan 17, 2009 and Apr 22, 2012, respectively. Their
pre-atmospheric orbits place them in the middle of the Taurid meteoroid stream,
which raises the intriguing possibility that comet 2P could be the parent body
of CM chondrites. To investigate whether a relationship between comet 2P, the
Taurid complex associated NEOs, and CM chondrites exists, we performed
photometric and spectroscopic studies of these objects in the visible
wavelength range. We observed 2P and 10 NEOs on Aug 2, 2011 with FORS at the
VLT. Images in the R filter, used to investigate the possible presence of
cometary activity around the nucleus of 2P and the NEOs, show that no resolved
coma is present. None of the FORS spectra show the 700 nm absorption feature
due to hydrated minerals that is seen in the CM chondrite meteorites. All
objects show featureless spectra with moderate reddening slopes at $\lambda <
800$nm. Apart for 2003 QC10 and 1999 VT25, which show a flatter spectrum, the
spectral slope of the observed NEOs is compatible with that of 2P. However,
most of the NEOs show evidence of a silicate absorption in lower S/N data at
$\lambda > 800$nm, which is not seen in 2P, which suggests that they are not
related. Despite similar orbits, we find no spectroscopic evidence for a link
between 2P, the Taurid complex NEOs and the Maribo and Sutter's Mill
meteorites. However, we cannot rule out a connection to the meteorites either,
as the spectral differences may be caused by secondary alteration of the
surfaces of the NEOs.

$O(\log t / t)$ for the synchronous and asynchronous cases respectively, where

maximally reduce the entropy of the posterior distribution over the Pareto set.
Critically, the PESMO multi-objective acquisition function can be decomposed as
a sum of objective-specific acquisition functions, which enables the algorithm
to be used in \emph{decoupled} scenarios in which the objectives can be
evaluated separately and perhaps with different costs. This decoupling
capability also makes it possible to identify difficult objectives that require
more evaluations. PESMO also offers gains in efficiency, as its cost scales
linearly with the number of objectives, in comparison to the exponential cost
of other methods. We compare PESMO with other related methods for
multi-objective Bayesian optimization on synthetic and real-world problems. The
results show that PESMO produces better recommendations with a smaller number

improvements in performance, particularly when the number of objectives is

bosons together with the standard-model field content. The new particles
preserve custodial symmetry as well as an approximate left-right parity
symmetry. The enhanced symmetry of the model allows it to satisfy precision
electroweak constraints and bounds from Higgs physics in a regime where all the
couplings are perturbative and where the amount of fine-tuning is comparable to
that in the standard model itself.
  We find that the model could explain the recently observed excesses in
di-boson processes at invariant mass close to 2 TeV from LHC Run 1 for a range
of allowed parameter space. The masses of all the particles differ by no more
than roughly 10%. In a portion of the allowed parameter space only one of the
new particles has a production cross section large enough to be detectable with
the energy and luminosity of Run 1, both via its decay to WZ and to Wh, while
the others have suppressed production rates. The model can be tested at the
higher-energy and higher-luminosity run of the LHC even for an overall scale of
the new particles higher than 3 TeV.

economic sector has recently been extended by Florio et al to infrastructures
of basic research. As a case study the large accelerator LHC at CERN and its
experiments have been selected since as a paradigmatic example of frontier
research they offer an excellent case to test the CBA model. It will be shown
that in spite of this improved method the LHC poses serious difficulties for
such an analysis. Some principle difficulties are due to the special character
of scientific projects. Their main result is the production of new basic
scientific knowledge whose net social value cannot be easily expressed in
monetary terms. Other problems are related to the very strong integration of
LHC into the general activities of CERN providing however, interesting
observations concerning a new management style for global projects. Finally the
mission of CERN (including LHC) is unique since it was founded with two tasks -
promote science and bring nations together. No way has yet been developed to
assess in economic terms success for the second objective. The main conclusion
is that the overall result of the CB analysis, the Net Present Value, although
positive for LHC, has a large uncertainty and if used to assess a project needs
a detailed discussion. On the other hand partial results can be very useful,
for example for the results of education or technology transfer.

are given a point set that is supposed to sample a hidden ground truth $K$ in a

of the main goals of denoising algorithms is to eliminate such noise so that

denoising approaches such as deconvolution and thresholding often require the

  Specifically, first, we propose a simple denoising algorithm that requires
only a single parameter but provides a theoretical guarantee on the quality of
the output on general input points. We argue that this single parameter cannot
be avoided. We next present a simple algorithm that avoids even this parameter
by paying for it with a slight strengthening of the sampling condition on the

longer-term emission variability have emerged that are often correlated with
changes in the rotational properties of the pulsar. To further illuminate this
relationship, we have developed techniques to identify emission and rotation
variability in pulsar data, and determine correlations between the two.
Individual observations may be too noisy to identify subtle changes in the
pulse profile. We use Gaussian process (GP) regression to model noisy
observations and produce a continuous map of pulse profile variability.
Generally, multiple observing epochs are required to obtain the pulsar spin
frequency derivative ($\dot{\nu}$). GP regression is, therefore, also used to
obtain $\dot{\nu}$, under the hypothesis that pulsar timing noise is primarily
caused by unmodelled changes in $\dot{\nu}$. Our techniques distinguish between
two types of variability: changes in the total flux density versus changes in
the pulse shape. We have applied these techniques to 168 pulsars observed by
the Parkes radio telescope, and see that although variations in flux density
are ubiquitous, substantial changes in the shape of the pulse profile are rare.
We reproduce previously published results and present examples of profile shape
changing in seven pulsars; in particular, a clear new example of correlated
changes in profile shape and rotation is found in PSR~J1602$-$5100. In the
shape changing pulsars, a more complex picture than the previously proposed two
state model emerges. We conclude that our simple assumption that all timing
noise can be interpreted as $\dot{\nu}$ variability is insufficient to explain
our dataset.

inference in models where the posterior distribution is analytical intractable
or computationally costly to evaluate directly. It operates by introducing
additional auxiliary variables into the model and form an extended target
distribution, which then can be evaluated point-wise. In many cases, the
standard Metropolis-Hastings is then applied to sample from the extended target
and the sought posterior can be obtained by marginalisation. However, in some
implementations this approach suffers from poor mixing as the auxiliary
variables are sampled from an independent proposal. We propose a modification
to the pmMH algorithm in which a Crank-Nicolson (CN) proposal is used instead.
This results in that we introduce a positive correlation in the auxiliary
variables. We investigate how to tune the CN proposal and its impact on the
mixing of the resulting pmMH sampler. The conclusion is that the proposed
modification can have a beneficial effect on both the mixing of the Markov
chain and the computational cost for each iteration of the pmMH algorithm.

similar values between 2.2\pm0.2 and 2.9\pm0.2. In contrast, we find an OPR of

the clumps are disrupted by the reverse shock is investigated. The dust
evolution in the dense ejecta clumps of Type II-P supernovae and their remnants
is also studied. We study oxygen-rich clumps that describe the ejecta oxygen
core, and carbon-rich clumps that correspond to the outermost carbon-rich
ejecta zone. We consider the dust components formed in the supernova, several
reverse shock velocities and inter-clump gas temperatures, and derive dust
grain size distributions and masses as a function of time. We find that
non-thermal sputtering in clumps is important and accounts for reducing the
grain population by ~ 40% to 80% in mass, depending on the clump gas
over-density and the grain type and size. A Type II-b supernova forms small
grains that are sputtered within clumps and in the inter-clump medium. For Cas
A, silicate grains do not survive thermal sputtering in the inter-clump medium.
Our derived masses of currently processed silicate, alumina and carbon grains
in Cas A agree well with values derived from observations. Grains produced by
Type II-P supernovae better survive the remnant phase. For dense ejecta clumps,
dust survival efficiencies range between 42% and 98% in mass. For the SN1987A
model, the derived surviving dust mass is in the range ~ 0.06-0.13 Msolar. This
type of dense supernovae may efficiently provide galaxies with dust.
Specifically, silicate grains over 0.1 micron and other grains over 0,05 micron
survive thermal sputtering in the remnant. Therefore, pre-solar grains of

supernovae.

(e.g. OpenFlow ""Fast-failover"") do not allow programmers to tweak switches'
detection mechanism, thus leaving SDN operators still relying on proprietary
management interfaces (when available) to achieve guaranteed detection and
recovery delays. We propose SPIDER, an OpenFlow-like pipeline design that
provides i) a detection mechanism based on switches' periodic link probing and
ii) fast reroute of traffic flows even in case of distant failures, regardless
of controller availability. SPIDER can be implemented using stateful data plane
abstractions such as OpenState or Open vSwitch, and it offers guaranteed short
(i.e. ms) failure detection and recovery delays, with a configurable trade off
between overhead and failover responsiveness. We present here the SPIDER
pipeline design, behavioral model, and analysis on flow tables' memory impact.
We also implemented and experimentally validated SPIDER using OpenState (an
OpenFlow 1.3 extension for stateful packet processing), showing numerical
results on its performance in terms of recovery latency and packet losses.

dimensionality are either extensions of unsupervised techniques such as
principal component analysis, or variable selection procedures that rely on
modeling the regression function. In this paper, a supervised dimension
reduction method tailored to ordered categorical predictors is introduced. It
uses a model-based dimension reduction approach, inspired by extending
sufficient dimension reductions to the context of latent Gaussian variables.
The reduction is chosen without modeling the response as a function of the
predictors and does not impose any distributional assumption on the response or
on the response given the predictors. A likelihood-based estimator of the
reduction is derived and an iterative expectation-maximization type algorithm
is proposed to alleviate the computational load and thus make the method more
practical. A regularized estimator, which simultaneously achieves variable
selection and dimension reduction, is also presented. Performance of the
proposed method is evaluated through simulations and a real data example for
socioeconomic index construction, comparing favorably to widespread use
techniques.

appearance of supermassive black holes only ~900 Myr after the big bang, and
only ~500 Myr beyond the formation of Pop II and III stars. Aside from
heralding the onset of cosmic reionization, these first and second generation
stars could have reasonably produced the ~5-20 solar-mass seeds that eventually
grew into z~6-7 quasars. But this process would have taken ~900 Myr, a timeline
that appears to be at odds with the predictions of LCDM without an anomalously
high accretion rate, or some exotic creation of ~10^5 solar-mass seeds. There
is no evidence of either of these happening in the local universe. In this
paper, we show that a much simpler, more elegant solution to the supermassive
black hole anomaly is instead to view this process using the age-redshift
relation predicted by the R_h=ct Universe, an FRW cosmology with zero active
mass. In this context, cosmic reionization lasted from t~883 Myr to ~2 Gyr
(z~15 to z~6), so ~5-20 solar-mass black hole seeds formed shortly after
reionization had begun, would have evolved into ~10^10 solar-mass quasars by
z~6-7 simply via the standard Eddington-limited accretion rate. The consistency
of these observations with the age-redshift relationship predicted by R_h=ct
supports the existence of dark energy; but not in the form of a cosmological
constant.

these cell populations are separated by the bone marrow. Our model takes this

the high-energy tail have been the subject of intense research by the plasma
physics community. Such functions, known as kappa or superthermal
distributions, have been found to provide a better fitting to the VDFs measured
by spacecraft in the solar wind. One of the problems that is being addressed on
this new light is the temperature anisotropy of solar wind protons and
electrons. In the literature, the general treatment for waves excited by
(bi-)Maxwellian plasmas is well-established. However, for kappa distributions,
the wave characteristics have been studied mostly for the limiting cases of
purely parallel or perpendicular propagation, relative to the ambient magnetic
field. Contributions to the general case of obliquely-propagating
electromagnetic waves have been scarcely reported so far. The absence of a
general treatment prevents a complete analysis of the wave-particle interaction
in kappa plasmas, since some instabilities can operate simultaneously both in
the parallel and oblique directions. In a recent work, Gaelzer and Ziebell [J.
Geophys. Res. 119, 9334 (2014)] obtained expressions for the dielectric tensor
and dispersion relations for the low-frequency, quasi-perpendicular dispersive
Alfv\'en waves resulting from a kappa VDF. In the present work, the formalism
introduced by Ref. 1 is generalized for the general case of electrostatic
and/or electromagnetic waves propagating in a kappa plasma in any frequency
range and for arbitrary angles. An isotropic distribution is considered, but
the methods used here can be easily applied to more general anisotropic
distributions, such as the bi-kappa or product-bi-kappa.

formulations, we do not constrain the set of decompositions, except by
contracting pixels to superpixels. The main challenge, as we show, is to
enforce the morality of lineages, i.e., the constraint that cells do not merge.
To enforce morality, we introduce path-cut inequalities. To find feasible
solutions of the NP-hard ILP, with certified bounds to the global optimum, we
define efficient separation procedures and apply these as part of a
branch-and-cut algorithm. We show the effectiveness of this approach by
analyzing feasible solutions for real microscopy data in terms of bounds and
run-time, and by their weighted edit distance to ground truth lineage forests
traced by humans.

stationary axially symmetric black holes are asymptotically flat. They possess
a non-trivial scalar field outside their regular event horizon. We present an
overview of the parameter space of the solutions together with a study of their
basic properties. We point out that the EGBd black holes can exhibit some
physical differences when compared to the Kerr solution. For example, their
mass is always bounded from below, while their angular momentum can exceed the
Kerr bound, Also, in contrast to the Kerr case, the extremal solutions are
singular, with the scalar field diverging on the horizon.

molecular weight atmospheres. Next we simulate the $\lambda = 1 - 11$ $\mu$m
transmission and emission spectra of these systems for several JWST instrument
modes for single transit and eclipse events. We then perform retrievals to
determine how well temperatures and molecular mixing ratios (CH$_4$, CO,
CO$_2$, H$_2$O, NH$_3$) can be constrained. We find that $\lambda = 1 - 2.5$
$\mu$m transmission spectra will often constrain the major molecular
constituents of clear solar composition atmospheres well. Cloudy or high mean
molecular weight atmospheres will often require full $1 - 11$ $\mu$m spectra
for good constraints, and emission data may be more useful in cases of
sufficiently high $F_p$ and high $F_p/F_*$. Strong temperature inversions in
the solar composition hot Jupiter atmosphere should be detectable with $1 -
2.5+$ $\mu$m emission spectra, and $1 - 5+$ $\mu$m emission spectra will
constrain the temperature-pressure profiles of warm planets. Transmission
spectra over $1 - 5+$ $\mu$m will constrain [Fe/H] values to better than 0.5
dex for the clear atmospheres of the hot and warm planets studied.
Carbon-to-oxygen ratios can be constrained to better than a factor of 2 in some
systems. We expect that these results will provide useful predictions of the
scientific value of single event JWST spectra until its on-orbit performance is
known.

particular, we will show that if $\delta_t>0$ for some $t\in

The pcubed construction, a reformulation of the twisted-diagonal procedure by
M. M Wolf and D. Perez-Garcia, [Phys. Rev. A 75, 012303 (2007)], can be used to
produce a large class of degradable quantum channels; degradable channels are
of interest because their quantum capacities are easy to calculate. Several
known types of degradable channels are either pcubed channels, or subchannels
(employing a subspace of the channel entrance), or continuous limits of pcubed
channels. The pcubed construction also yields channels which are neither
degradable nor antidegradable (i.e., the complement of a degradable channel); a
particular example of a qutrit channel of this type is studied in some detail.
Determining whether a pcubed channel is degradable or antidegradable or neither
is quite straightforward given the pure input and output states that
characterize the channel. Conjugate degradable pcubed channels are always

characterized by low disc surface density and low star formation rate. These
are known to be dominated by dark matter halo from the innermost regions. Here
we study the role of dark matter halo on the grand-design, $m=2$, spiral modes
in a galactic disc by carrying out a global mode analysis in the WKB
approximation. The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule is used to determine how
many discrete global spiral modes are permitted. First a typical superthin LSB
galaxy, UGC 7321 is studied by taking only the galactic disc, modelled as
fluid; and then the disc embedded in a dark matter halo. We find that both
cases permit the existence of global spiral modes. This is in contrast to
earlier results where the inclusion of dark matter halo was shown to nearly
fully suppress local, swing-amplified spiral features. Although technically
global modes are permitted in the fluid model as shown here, we argue that due
to lack of tidal interactions, these are not triggered in LSB galaxies. For
comparison, we carried out a similar analysis for the Galaxy, for which the
dark matter halo does not dominate in the inner regions. We show that here too
the dark matter halo has little effect, hence the disc embedded in a halo is
also able to support global modes. The derived pattern speed of the global mode
agrees fairly well with the observed value for the Galaxy.

multiple users harvest energy from a dedicated power station and then
communicate with an information receiving station. Our goal is to investigate
the maximum achievable energy efficiency (EE) of the network via joint time
allocation and power control while taking into account the initial battery
energy of each user. We first study the EE maximization problem in the WPCN
without any system throughput requirement. We show that the EE maximization
problem for the WPCN can be cast into EE maximization problems for two
simplified networks via exploiting its special structure. For each problem, we
derive the optimal solution and provide the corresponding physical
interpretation, despite the non-convexity of the problems. Subsequently, we
study the EE maximization problem under a minimum system throughput constraint.
Exploiting fractional programming theory, we transform the resulting non-convex
problem into a standard convex optimization problem. This allows us to
characterize the optimal solution structure of joint time allocation and power
control and to derive an efficient iterative algorithm for obtaining the
optimal solution. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint time and power
optimization.

as highly secured Diffractive Optical Variable Image Devices (DOVIDs). They
allowed new distinct optical effects and dramatically lowered DOVIDs
counterfeiting. In particular, subwalength gratings coated with a high
refractive index dielectric are well-known and mass-produced to secure
documents, such as the Diffractive Identification Devices (DIDs). These
submicronic gratings are called Zero Order Devices or Filters (ZOD, ZOF) or
diffractive microstructures designed for Zero-order read-out. Similar
structures are called Resonant Waveguide Gratings (RWG) or Resonant Leaky Mode
Waveguides, when optimized for different purposes. A study using time-resolved
optical simulations can demonstrate and quantify how light is coupled and
propagation in DIDs structure when observed across the gratings (in collinear
incidence). The leaky resonant modes of the RWG are playing a significant role
in the appearance of DIDs in collinear incidence, which has practical impacts
on the engineering of such security elements. From the learning of such
non-local light interactions in DIDs, new optically variable effects can be
designed and produced by using light transport in RWG. As an example,
multi-frequency RWGs can be designed to couple light for different colors and
polarizations and to outcouple them away from the specular configuration
typical to the Zero Order Devices. As a further step, we present new structures
able to couple light in the substrates or in selected layers of security
documents or labels, embling waveguiding light in these layers. These optical
couplers enable selective light transport at a macroscopic scale using total
internal reflection in the volume of the substrates, while being compatible

symmetries of long-range models around critical points. We focus in particular
on the Kitaev chain with long-range pairings decaying with distance as
power-law with exponent $\alpha$. This is a quadratic solvable model, yet
displaying non-trivial quantum phase transitions. By renormalization group
approach we derive first the effective theory close to the critical line at
positive chemical potential. This is the sum of two terms: a Dirac action
$S_D$, found in the short-range Ising universality class, and a CS breaking
term $S_{AN}$. While $S_D$ originates from low-energy excitations, $S_{AN}$
derives from the higher energy modes where singularities develop, due to the
long-range nature of the model. At criticality $S_{AN}$ flows to zero if
$\alpha > 2$, while if $\alpha < 2$ it dominates and determines the breakdown
of the CS. Out of criticality $S_{AN}$ breaks, in the considered approximation,
the effective Lorentz invariance (ELI) for every finite $\alpha$. As $\alpha$
increases, such ELI breakdown becomes less and less pronounced and in the
short-range limit $\alpha \to \infty$ the ELI is restored. To test the validity
of the effective theory, we compared the two-fermion static correlations and
the von Neumann entropy obtained from them with the ones calculated on the
lattice, finding agreement. From the effective theory one can also see that new
phases emerge for $\alpha < 1$. Finally we show that at every finite $\alpha$
the critical exponents are the same as for the short-range ($\alpha \to
\infty$) model. At variance, for the critical line with negative chemical
potential, only $S_{AN}$ ($S_D$) is present for $1 < \alpha < 2$ (for $\alpha >
2$). Close to this line, where the minimum of the spectrum coincides with the
momentum where singularities develop, the critical exponents change exactly
where CS is broken.

billion bases in amoeba. This remarkable variation in genome size is the
outcome of complex interactions between various evolutionary factors such as
point mutation rate, population size, insertions and deletions, and genome
editing mechanisms that may be specific to certain taxonomic lineages. While
comparative genomics analyses have uncovered some of the relationships between
these diverse evolutionary factors, we still do not understand what drives
genome size evolution. Specifically, it is not clear how primordial mutational
processes of base substitutions, insertions, and deletions influence genome
size evolution in asexual organisms. Here, we use digital evolution to
investigate genome size evolution by tracking genome edits and their fitness
effects in real time. In agreement with empirical data, we find that mutation
rate is inversely correlated with genome size in asexual populations. We show
that at low point mutation rate, insertions are significantly more beneficial
than deletions, driving genome expansion and acquisition of phenotypic
complexity. Conversely, high mutational load experienced at high mutation rates
inhibits genome growth, forcing the genomes to compress genetic information.
Our analyses suggest that the inverse relationship between mutation rate and
genome size is a result of the tradeoff between evolving phenotypic innovation
and limiting the mutational load.

(Pourbaix) diagrams. With this scheme, we study the electrochemical stabilities
of Ti and Ti oxides using density-functional theory. First, we find the
accuracy of an exchange-correlation functional in predicting formation energies
and electrochemical stabilities is closely related with the electronic exchange
interaction therein. Second, the metaGGA and hybrid functionals with a more
precise description of the electronic exchange interaction lead to a systematic
improvement in the accuracy of the Pourbaix diagrams. Furthermore, we show that
accurate Ti Pourbaix diagrams also require that thermal effects are included
through vibrational contributions to the free energy. We then use these
diagrams to explain various experimental electrochemical phenomena for the
Ti--O system, and show that if experimental formation energies for Ti oxides,
which contain contributions from defects owing to their generation at high
(combustion) temperatures, are directly used to predict room temperature
Pourbaix diagrams then significant inaccuracies result. In contrast, the
formation energies from accurate first-principles calculations, e.g., using
metaGGA and hybrid functionals, are found to be more reliable. Finally to
facilitate the future application of our accurate electrochemical phase

Survey (SDSS) biases the distribution of satellite galaxies discovered by it to
align with the polar plane defined by the 11 brighter, classical Milky Way (MW)
satellites. This might prevent the SDSS satellites from adding significance to
the MW's Vast Polar Structure (VPOS). We investigate whether this argument is
valid by comparing the observed situation with model satellite distributions
confined to the exact SDSS footprint area. We find that the SDSS satellites
indeed add to the significance of the VPOS and that the survey footprint rather
biases away from a close alignment between the plane fitted to the SDSS
satellites and the plane fitted to the 11 classical satellites. Finding the
observed satellite phase-space alignments of both the classical and SDSS
satellites is a ~5{\sigma} event with respect to an isotropic distribution.
This constitutes a robust discovery of the VPOS and makes it more significant
than the Great Plane of Andromeda (GPoA). Motivated by the GPoA, which consists
of only about half of M31's satellites, we also estimate which fraction of the
MW satellites is consistent with being part of an isotropic distribution.
Depending on the underlying satellite plane width, only 2 to 6 out of the 27
considered MW satellites are expected to be drawn from isotropy, and an
isotropic component of >50% of the MW satellite population is excluded at 95%
confidence.

accretion onto the central star on the snowline locations of the main C and O
carriers in a protoplanetary disk, H2O, CO2 and CO, and their consequences for
the C/O ratio in gas and dust throughout the disk. We determine the snowline

irradiated disk, and ~0.001 cm < s < 7 m for an evolving and viscous disk,
desorb at a size-dependent location in the disk, which is independent of the
particle's initial position. The snowline radius decreases for larger
particles, up to sizes of ~7 m. Compared to a static disk, we find that radial
drift and gas accretion in a viscous disk move the H2O snowline inwards by up

highly constraining upper limits on the amplitude of the nanohertz
gravitational-wave stochastic signal from the mergers of supermassive
black-hole binaries ($\sim 10^{-15}$ strain at $f = 1/\mathrm{yr}$). These
limits suggest that binary merger rates have been overestimated, or that
environmental influences from nuclear gas or stars accelerate orbital decay,
reducing the gravitational-wave signal at the lowest, most sensitive
frequencies. This prompts the question whether nanohertz gravitational waves
are likely to be detected in the near future. In this letter, we answer this
question quantitatively using simple statistical estimates, deriving the range
of true signal amplitudes that are compatible with current upper limits, and
computing expected detection probabilities as a function of observation time.
We conclude that small arrays consisting of the pulsars with the least timing
noise, which yield the tightest upper limits, have discouraging prospects of
making a detection in the next two decades. By contrast, we find large arrays
are crucial to detection because the quadrupolar spatial correlations induced
by gravitational waves can be well sampled by many pulsar pairs. Indeed, timing
programs which monitor a large and expanding set of pulsars have an $\sim 80\%$
probability of detecting gravitational waves within the next ten years, under
assumptions on merger rates and environmental influences ranging from
optimistic to conservative. Even in the extreme case where $90\%$ of binaries
stall before merger and environmental coupling effects diminish low-frequency
gravitational-wave power, detection is delayed by at most a few years.

X-ray absorbed are often used interchangeably. But there are many borderline
cases and also numerous examples where the optical and X-ray classifications
appear to be in conflict. In this article we re-visit the relation between
optical obscuration and X-ray absorption in AGNs. We make use of our ""dust
color"" method (Burtscher et al. 2015) to derive the optical obscuration A_V and
consistently estimated X-ray absorbing columns using 0.3--150 keV spectral
energy distributions. We also take into account the variable nature of the
neutral gas column N_H and derive the Seyfert sub-classes of all our objects in
a consistent way.
  We show in a sample of 25 local, hard-X-ray detected Seyfert galaxies (log
L_X / (erg/s) ~ 41.5 - 43.5) that there can actually be a good agreement
between optical and X-ray classification. If Seyfert types 1.8 and 1.9 are
considered unobscured, the threshold between X-ray unabsorbed and absorbed
should be chosen at a column N_H = 10^22.3 / cm^2 to be consistent with the
optical classification.
  We find that N_H is related to A_V and that the N_H/A_V ratio is
approximately Galactic or higher in all sources, as indicated previously. But
in several objects we also see that deviations from the Galactic ratio are only
due to a variable X-ray column, showing that (1) deviations from the Galactic
N_H/A_V can simply be explained by dust-free neutral gas within the broad line
region in some sources, that (2) the dust properties in AGNs can be similar to
Galactic dust and that (3) the dust color method is a robust way to estimate
the optical extinction towards the sublimation radius in all but the most

brighter that single stars, potentially becoming the most important tracers of
the recent star formation history in galaxies in the local Universe. In local
galaxies, we also witness the presence of a large population of evolved star
clusters, commonly called globular clusters (GCs). GCs peak formation history
is very close to the redshift (z~2) when the cosmic star formation history
reached the maximum. Therefore, GCs are usually associated to extreme star
formation episodes in high-redshift galaxies. It is yet not clear whether YSCs
and GCs share a similar formation process (same physics under different
interstellar medium conditions) and evolution process, and whether the former
can be used as progenitor analogs of the latter. In this invited contribution,
I review general properties of YSC populations in local galaxies. I will
summarise some of the current open questions in the field, with particular
emphasis to whether or not galactic environments, where YSCs form, leave
imprints on the nested populations. The importance of this rapidly developing

resolution of IMaX allows us to resolve the interface region between
photosphere and corona, but modelling this region is challenging for the
following reasons. While the coronal magnetic field is thought to be force-free
(the Lorentz-force vanishes), this is not the case in the mixed plasma $\beta$
environment in the photosphere and lower chromosphere. In our model, pressure
gradients and gravity forces are taken self-consistently into account and
compensate the non-vanishing Lorentz-force. Above a certain height (about 2 Mm)
the non-magnetic forces become very weak and consequently the magnetic field
becomes almost force-free. Here we apply a linear approach, where the electric
current density consists of a superposition of a field-line parallel current
and a current perpendicular to the Sun's gravity field. We illustrate the
prospects and limitations of this approach and give an outlook for an extension
towards a non-linear model.

challenge to devise a controlled analytical framework tracking this phenomenon.
A notable exception is the exactly solvable Kitaev model, in which spin degrees
of freedom fractionalize into Majorana fermions and a Z2 gauge field. Here we
discuss the physics of fractionalization in three-dimensional Kitaev models and
demonstrate that the itinerant Majorana fermions generically form a (semi)metal
which, depending on the underlying lattice structure, exhibits Majorana Fermi
surfaces, nodal lines or topologically protected Weyl nodes. We show that the
nature of these Majorana metals can be deduced from an elementary symmetry
analysis of the projective time-reversal and inversion symmetries for a given
lattice. This allows us to comprehensively classify the gapless spin liquids of
Kitaev models for the most elementary tricoordinated lattices in three
dimensions. We further expand this classification by addressing the effects of
time-reversal symmetry breaking and additional interactions.

planetary systems. Previous observations led to the hypothesis that for
close-in giant planets, spin-orbit alignment is enforced by tidal interactions.
Here, we examine two problems with this hypothesis. First, Mazeh and coworkers
recently used a new technique -- based on the amplitude of starspot-induced
photometric variability -- to conclude that spin-orbit alignment is common even
for relatively long-period planets, which would not be expected if tides were
responsible. We re-examine the data and find a statistically significant
correlation between photometric variability and planetary orbital period that
is qualitatively consistent with tidal interactions. However it is still
difficult to explain quantitatively, as it would require tides to be effective
for periods as long as tens of days. Second, Rogers and Lin argued against a
particular theory for tidal re-alignment by showing that initially retrograde
systems would fail to be re-aligned, in contradiction with the observed
prevalence of prograde systems. We investigate a simple model that overcomes
this problem by taking into account the dissipation of inertial waves and the
equilibrium tide, as well as magnetic braking. We identify a region of
parameter space where re-alignment can be achieved, but it only works for
close-in giant planets, and requires some fine tuning. Thus, while we find both
problems to be more nuanced than they first appeared, the tidal model still has
serious shortcomings.

population of galaxies that were far more common at earlier epochs than today.
Based on spectroscopic and photometric measurements of LCBGs in massive (M
>10^15 M_sun), intermediate redshift (0.5 < z < 0.9) galaxy clusters, we
present their rest-frame properties including star-formation rate, dynamical
mass, size, luminosity, and metallicity. The appearance of these small, compact
galaxies in clusters at intermediate redshift helps explain the observed
redshift evolution in the size-luminosity relationship among cluster galaxies.
In addition, we find the rest-frame properties of LCBGs appearing in galaxy
clusters are indistinguishable from field LCBGs at the same redshift. Up to 35%
of the LCBGs show significant discrepancies between optical and infrared
indicators of star formation, suggesting that star formation occurs in obscured
regions. Nonetheless, the star formation for LCBGs shows a decrease toward the
center of the galaxy clusters. Based on their position and velocity, we
estimate that up to 10% of cluster LCBGs are likely to merge with another
cluster galaxy. Finally, the observed properties and distributions of the LCBGs
in these clusters lead us to conclude that we are witnessing the quenching of
the progenitors of dwarf elliptical galaxies that dominate the number density
of present-epoch galaxy clusters.

we investigate dynamical decoders that provide passive error correction by
embedding the decoding process into local dynamics. We propose a specific

provide numerical evidence showing that the logical qubit has a survival time
extended by several orders of magnitude over that of a bare unencoded qubit. We
stress that (asynchronous) dynamical decoding gives rise to a Markovian
dissipative process. We hence equate cellular-automaton decoding to a fully
dissipative topological quantum memory, which removes errors continuously. In
this sense, uncontrolled and unwanted local noise can be corrected for by a
controlled local dissipative process. We analyze the required resources,
commenting on additional polylogarithmic factors beyond those incurred by an
ideal constant resource dynamical decoder.

in compact binary mergers power optical/infrared macronovae (kilonovae) that
follow these events. The light curves depend critically on the energy partition
among the different products of the radioactive decay and this plays an
important role in estimates of the amount of ejected $r$-process elements from
a given observed signal. We study the energy partition and $\gamma$-ray
emission of the radioactive decay. We show that $20$-$50\%$ of the total
radioactive energy is released in $\gamma$-rays on timescales from hours to a
month. The number of emitted $\gamma$-rays per unit energy interval has roughly
a flat spectrum between a few dozen keV and $1$ MeV so that most of this energy
is carried by $\sim 1$ MeV $\gamma$-rays. However at the peak of macronova
emission the optical depth of the $\gamma$-rays is $\sim 0.02$ and most of the
$\gamma$-rays escape. The loss of these $\gamma$-rays reduces the heat
deposition into the ejecta and hence reduces the expected macronova signals if
those are lanthanides dominated. This implies that the ejected mass is larger
by a factor of $2$-$3$ than what was previously estimated. Spontaneous fission
heats up the ejecta and the heating rate can increase if a sufficient amount of
transuranic nuclei are synthesized. Direct measurements of these escaping
$\gamma$-rays may provide the ultimate proof for the macronova mechanisms and
an identification of the $r$-process nucleosynthesis sites. However, the
chances to detect these signals are slim with current X-ray and $\gamma$-ray
missions. New detectors, more sensitive by at least a factor of ten, are needed
for a realistic detection rate.

(ii) the delays between the merger of two galaxies and the merger of the black

the gas supplied at large radii, inviscid advection-dominated accretion flows
can display velocity profiles with either preshock deceleration or preshock
acceleration. Nakayama has shown that these two types of flow configurations
are expected to have different stability properties. By employing the Chevalier
\& Imamura linearization method and the Nakayama instability boundary
conditions, we discover that there are regions of parameter space where
disks/shocks with outflows can be stable or unstable. In regions of
instability, we find that preshock deceleration is always unstable to the
zeroth mode with zero frequency of oscillation, but is always stable to the
fundamental mode and overtones. Furthermore, we also find that preshock
acceleration is always unstable to the zeroth mode and that the fundamental
mode and overtones become increasingly less stable as the shock location moves
away from the horizon when the disk half-height expands above $\sim 12$
gravitational radii at the shock radius. In regions of stability, we
demonstrate the zeroth mode to be stable for the velocity profiles that exhibit
preshock acceleration and deceleration. Moreover, for models that are linearly
unstable, our model suggests the possible existence of quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) with ratios 2:3 and 3:5. These ratios are believed to occur
in stellar and supermassive black hole candidates, for example, in GRS 1915+105
and Sgr A*, respectively. We expect that similar QPO ratios also exist in
regions of stable shocks.

of cache miss -- Cold, Conflict and Capacity. Tiling for cache is typically
guided by capacity miss counts. Models of cache function have not been
effectively used to guide cache tiling optimizations due to model error and
expense. Instead, heuristic or empirical approaches are used to select tilings.
We argue that conflict misses, traditionally neglected or seen as a small
constant effect, are the only fundamentally important cache miss category, that
they form a solid basis by which caches can become modellable, and that models
leaning on cache associatvity analysis can be used to generate cache performant
tilings. We develop a mathematical framework that expresses potential and
actual cache misses in associative caches using Associativity Lattices. We show
these lattices to possess two theoretical advantages over rectangular tiles --
volume maximization and miss regularity. We also show that to generate such
lattice tiles requires, unlike rectangular tiling, no explicit, expensive
lattice point counting. We also describe an implementation of our lattice
tiling approach, show that it can be used to give speedups of over 10x versus
unoptimized code, and despite currently only tiling for one level of cache, can
already be competitive with the aggressive compiler optimizations used in
general purposes compares such as GCC and Intel's ICC. We also show that the
tiling approach can lead to reasonable automatic parallelism when compared to
existing auto-threading compilers.

localization, and optical absorption of triangular core-shell quantum rings. We
show how these properties depend on geometric details of the triangle, such as
side thickness or corners' symmetry. For equilateral triangles, the lowest six
energy states (including spin) are grouped in an energy shell, are localized
only around corner areas, and are separated by a large energy gap from the
states with higher energy which are localized on the sides of the triangle. The
energy levels strongly depend on the aspect ratio of the triangle sides, i.e.,
thickness/length ratio, in such a way that the energy differences are not
monotonous functions of this ratio. In particular, the energy gap between the
group of states localized in corners and the states localized on the sides
strongly decreases with increasing the side thickness, and then slightly
increases for thicker samples. With increasing the thickness the low-energy
shell remains distinct but the spatial distribution of these states spreads.
The behavior of the energy levels and localization leads to a thickness
dependent absorption spectrum where one transition may be tuned in the THz
domain and a second transition can be tuned from THz to the infrared range of
electromagnetic spectrum. We show how these features may be further controlled
with an external magnetic field. In this work the electron-electron Coulomb
repulsion is neglected.

network topology and the orders of magnitude of kinetic parameters, the number
of such metastable regimes is finite. The dynamics of the network can be
described as a sequence of jumps from one metastable regime to another. We show
that a geometrically computed connectivity graph restricts the set of possible
jumps. We also provide finite state machine (Markov chain) models for such
dynamic changes. Applied to signal transduction models, our approach unravels
dynamical and functional capacities of signaling pathways, as well as
parameters responsible for specificity of the pathway response. In particular,
for a model of TGF$\beta$ signalling, we find that the ratio of TGFBR1 to
TGFBR2 concentrations can be used to discriminate between metastable regimes.
Using expression data from the NCI60 panel of human tumor cell lines, we show
that aggressive and non-aggressive tumour cell lines function in different
metastable regimes and can be distinguished by measuring the relative

Recently, a tentative detection of Rayleigh scattering in its atmosphere has

planetary radius as a function of decreasing wavelength in the visible. We set
out to verify this detection and observed several transits of this planet with

constant surface density, and for varying surface density scale with both the
cloud`s size and surface density, $\sigma^2 \propto R \Sigma$. The energy
source driving these chaotic motions remains poorly understood. We describe the
velocity dispersions observed in a cloud population formed in a
kiloparsec-scale numerical simulation of a magnetized, supernova-driven,
self-gravitating, interstellar medium, including diffuse heating and radiative
cooling. We compare the relationships between velocity dispersion, size, and
surface density measured in the simulated cloud population to those found in
observations of Galactic molecular clouds. We find that external supernova
explosions can not drive turbulent motions of the observed magnitudes within
dense clouds. On the other hand, self-gravity also induces non-thermal motions
as gravitationally bound clouds begin to collapse in our model, and by doing so
their internal velocity dispersions recover the observed relations. Energy
conservation suggests that the observed behavior is consistent with the kinetic
energy being proportional to the gravitational energy. However, the clouds in
our model show no sign of reaching a stable equilibrium state at any time, even
for strongly magnetized clouds. We conclude that gravitationally bound
molecular clouds are always in a state of gravitational collapse and their
properties are a natural result of this chaotic collapse. In order to agree
with observed star formation efficiencies, this process must be terminated by
the early destruction of the clouds, presumably from internal stellar feedback.

overlap the results for early-type galaxies of similar masses, and, by doing
so, strengthen the case for a dependence of the number of globular clusters per

satisfactorily described as T$_{\rm N} = ({\rm M}_*/10^{6.7})^{-0.56}$ when

only weakly constrained and extrapolation outside this range is not advised.
Our late-type galaxies, in contrast to our early-types, do not show the

calculate that in a volume limited, local Universe sample, clusters are most
likely to be found around fairly massive galaxies (M$_* \sim 10^{10.8}$

manage distinct customer bases. In such data-rich and dynamic environments,
visualization plays a key role in understanding events of interest. These ideas
have led to the popularity of analytics dashboards, yet academic research has
paid scant attention to these managerial needs. We develop a probabilistic,
nonparametric framework for understanding and predicting individual-level
spending using Gaussian process priors over latent functions that describe
customer spending along calendar time, interpurchase time, and customer
lifetime dimensions. These curves form a dashboard that provides a visual
model-based representation of purchasing dynamics that is easily
comprehensible. The model flexibly and automatically captures the form and
duration of the impact of events that influence spend propensity, even when
such events are unknown a-priori. We illustrate the use of our Gaussian Process
Propensity Model (GPPM) on data from two popular mobile games. We show that the
GPPM generalizes hazard and buy-till-you-die models by incorporating calendar
time dynamics while simultaneously accounting for recency and lifetime effects.
It therefore provides insights about spending propensity beyond those available

necessitates a renewed discussion about sovereignty in space. The
non-appropriation principle of the Outer Space Treaty currently prohibits any
sovereign claims to celestial bodies, but it remains unclear how this principle
should be applied to the peaceful colonization of Mars. Here we develop a
pragmatic approach to guide the settlement of Mars, which is based upon a
""bounded first possession"" model with mandatory planetary parks. Scientists,
experts, and leaders will establish planetary park locations and regulations
through worldwide community solicitation in order to protect sites of
scientific, aesthetic, historical, cultural, environmental, spiritual value.
Colonization parties may occupy limited plots of martian land and may claim
exclusive economic rights within this zone, while still refraining from any
claims to sovereignty. All colonists remain under the legal jurisdiction of
their host nation, with conflicts to be resolved diplomatically or through a
temporary tribunal system composed of representatives from other Mars colonies.
We also propose the formation of a Mars Secretariat as an administrative body
with limited power to facilitate communication among parties. Our model for
Mars colonization remains consistent with the Outer Space Treaty, but we also
recommend revisiting or amending the non-appropriation and province of mankind
principles to resolve the ambiguity of how nations, corporations, and
individuals may utilize the resources of space.

flows of gas through them, are sensitive to a number of factors. One that has
been considered only occasionally in the literature is external
photoevaporation by far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from nearby, massive stars,
despite the fact that nearly half of all disks will experience
photoevaporation. Another effect apparently not considered in the literature is
a spatially and temporally varying value of $\alpha$ in the disk [where the
turbulent viscosity $\nu$ is $\alpha$ times the sound speed C times the disk
scale height H]. Here we use the formulation of Bai \& Stone (2011) to relate
$\alpha$ to the ionization fraction in the disk, assuming turbulent transport
of angular momentum is due to the magnetorotational instability. We find that
disk evolution is most sensitive to the surface area of dust. Typically $\alpha
\lesssim 10^{-5}$ in the inner disk ($< 2$ AU), rising to $\sim 10^{-1}$ beyond
20 AU. This drastically alters the structure of the disk and the flow of mass
through it: while the outer disk rapidly viscously spreads, the inner disk
hardly evolves; this leads to a steep surface density profile with a slope < p
> $\approx$ 2 - 5 in the 5-30 AU region) that is made steeper by external
photoevaporation. We also find that the combination of variable $\alpha$ and
external photoevaporation eventually causes gas as close as 3 AU, previously
accreting inward, to be drawn outward to the photoevaporated outer edge of the
disk. These effects have drastic consequences for planet formation and volatile
transport in protoplanetary disks.

each orbit (P1=26.4960 \pm 0.0028 d) one radio outburst occurs whose amplitude
is modulated with Plong, a long-term period of more than 4 yr. It is still not
clear whether the compact object of the system or the companion Be star is
responsible for the long-term modulation. We study here the stability of Plong.
Such a stability is expected if Plong is due to periodic (P2) Doppler boosting
of periodic (P1) ejections from the accreting compact object of the system. On
the contrary it is not expected if Plong is related to variations in the mass
loss of the companion Be star. We built a database of 36.8 yr of radio
observations of LSI +61 303 covering more than 8 long-term cycles. We performed
timing and correlation analysis. In addition to the two dominant features at P1
and P2, the timing analysis gives a feature at Plong=1628 \pm 48 days. The
determined value of Plong agrees with the beat of the two dominant features,
i.e. Pbeat=1/(\nu1 -\nu2)=1626 \pm 68 d. The correlation coefficient of the
radio data oscillates at multiples of Pbeat. Cycles in varying Be stars change
in length and disappear after 2-3 cycles following the well-studied case of the
binary system zeta Tau. On the contrary, in LSI +61 303 the long-term period is
quite stable and repeats itself over the available 8 cycles. The long-term
modulation in LSI +61 303 accurately reflects the beat of periodical Doppler
boosting (induced by precession) with the periodicity of the ejecta. The peak
of the long-term modulation occurs at the coincidence of the maximum number of
ejected particles with the maximum Doppler boosting of their emission; this
coincidence occurs every 1/(\nu1 - \nu2) and creates the long-term modulation
observed in LSI +61 303.

networks. Contrary to a classical neural network, a belief network can predict
more than the expected value of the output $Y$ given the input $X$. It can
predict a distribution of outputs $Y$ which is useful when an input can admit
multiple outputs whose average is not necessarily a valid answer. Such networks
are particularly relevant to inverse problems such as image prediction for
denoising, or text to speech. However, traditional sigmoid belief networks are
hard to train and are not suited to continuous problems. This work introduces a
new family of networks called linearizing belief nets or LBNs. A LBN decomposes
into a deep linear network where each linear unit can be turned on or off by
non-deterministic binary latent units. It is a universal approximator of
real-valued conditional distributions and can be trained using gradient
descent. Moreover, the linear pathways efficiently propagate continuous
information and they act as multiplicative skip-connections that help
optimization by removing gradient diffusion. This yields a model which trains
efficiently and improves the state-of-the-art on image denoising and facial
expression generation with the Toronto faces dataset.

the interstellar medium is constantly condensing to star-forming clouds on the
dynamical time of the average midplane density, and the clouds are constantly
being disrupted on the dynamical time scale appropriate for their higher
density. In this model, the areal star formation rate scales with the 1.5 power
of the total gas column density throughout the main regions of spiral galaxies,
and with a steeper power, 2, in the far outer regions and in dwarf irregular
galaxies because of the flaring disks. At the same time, there is a molecular
star formation law that is linear in the main and outer parts of disks and in
dIrrs because the duration of individual structures in the molecular phase is
also the dynamical time scale, canceling the additional 0.5 power of surface
density. The total gas consumption time scales directly with the midplane
dynamical time, quenching star formation in the inner regions if there is no
accretion, and sustaining star formation for ~100 Gyr or more in the outer
regions with no qualitative change in gas stability or molecular cloud
properties. The ULIRG track follows from high densities in galaxy collisions.

First, we extend a recent result that, using a large-deviation analysis, shows
that the geometry of the space of solutions of the Binary Perceptron Learning
Problem (a prototypical CSP), contains regions of very high-density of
solutions. Despite being sub-dominant, these regions can be found by optimizing
a local entropy measure. Building on these results, we construct a fast solver
that relies exclusively on a local entropy estimate, and can be applied to
general CSPs. We describe its performance not only for the Perceptron Learning
Problem but also for the random $K$-Satisfiabilty Problem (another prototypical
CSP with a radically different structure), and show numerically that a simple
zero-temperature Metropolis search in the smooth local entropy landscape can
reach sub-dominant clusters of optimal solutions in a small number of steps,
while standard Simulated Annealing either requires extremely long cooling
procedures or just fails. We also discuss how the EdMC can heuristically be
made even more efficient for the cases we studied.

demonstrate that the conductance of single-molecule junctions based on a newly
discovered molecule, borospherene (B40), is comparable to that for the
C60-based junction with its more delocalized {\pi} electrons. The charge
injection efficiency in the B40-based junction is improved, as up to 7 atoms in
direct contact with the electrode are possible in the Au-B40-Au junction.
Interestingly, a higher number of atoms in direct contact with the electrode
does not result in a higher number of conduction channels because of the unique
chemical bonding in the B40 molecule, without two-center two- electron bonds.
The transport properties of Au-B40-Au junctions can be proved by doping. With a
Ca, Sr, or Y atom encapsulated into the B40 cage, the conductance at zero bias
increases significantly. Moreover, our calculations show that the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital dominates the low-bias transport, as the
thermopower in these junctions is negative. Our study indicates that B40 is an
attractive new platform for designing highly conductive single-molecule
junctions for future molecular circuits.

wave production from evaporating primordial black holes. These black holes emit
gravitons which are, at classical level, registered as gravity waves. We use
the latest constraints on their abundance, and calculate the power emitted in
gravitons at the time of their evaporation. We then solve the coupled system of
equations that gives us the evolution of the frequency and amplitude of gravity
waves during the expansion of the universe. The spectrum of gravitational waves
that can be detected today depends on multiple factors: fraction of the total
energy density which was occupied by primordial black holes, the epoch in which
they were formed, and quantities like their mass and angular momentum. We
conclude that very small primordial black holes which evaporate before the
big-bang nucleosynthesis emit gravitons whose spectral energy fraction today
can be as large as $10^{-7.5}$. On the other hand, those which are massive
enough so that they still exist now can yield a signal as high as $10^{-6.5}$.
However, typical frequencies of the gravity waves from primordial black holes
are still too high to be observed with the current and near future gravity wave
observations.

learning meta-parameters are themselves optimized using a validation set. Our
experiments show improved performance relative to widely used logistic and
hinge loss methods on a wide variety of problems ranging from standard UC

charge-coupled devices (CCD), is gaining popularity in astronomical
applications. By using an oversampling ADC and a digital filter, a DCDS system
can achieve a better performance than traditional analogue readout techniques
at the expense of a more complex system analysis. Several attempts to analyse
and optimize a DCDS system have been reported, but most of the work presented
in the literature has been experimental. Some approximate analytical tools have
been presented for independent parameters of the system, but the overall
performance and trade-offs have not been yet modelled. Furthermore, there is
disagreement among experimental results that cannot be explained by the
analytical tools available. In this work, a theoretical analysis of a generic
DCDS readout system is presented, including key aspects such as the signal
conditioning stage, the ADC resolution, the sampling frequency and the digital
filter implementation. By using a time-domain noise model, the effect of the
digital filter is properly modelled as a discrete-time process, thus avoiding
the imprecision of continuous-time approximations that have been used so far.
As a result, an accurate, closed-form expression for the signal-to-noise ratio
at the output of the readout system is reached. This expression can be easily
optimized in order to meet a set of specifications for a given CCD, thus
providing a systematic design methodology for an optimal readout system.
Simulated results are presented to validate the theory, obtained with both
time- and frequency-domain noise generation models for completeness.

measures that are often used as priors for Bayesian nonparametric models.
Dirichlet process is a well-known example of NRMs. Most of posterior inference
methods for NRM mixture models rely on MCMC methods since they are easy to
implement and their convergence is well studied. However, MCMC often suffers
from slow convergence when the acceptance rate is low. Tree-based inference is
an alternative deterministic posterior inference method, where Bayesian
hierarchical clustering (BHC) or incremental Bayesian hierarchical clustering
(IBHC) have been developed for DP or NRM mixture (NRMM) models, respectively.
Although IBHC is a promising method for posterior inference for NRMM models due
to its efficiency and applicability to online inference, its convergence is not
guaranteed since it uses heuristics that simply selects the best solution after
multiple trials are made. In this paper, we present a hybrid inference
algorithm for NRMM models, which combines the merits of both MCMC and IBHC.
Trees built by IBHC outlines partitions of data, which guides
Metropolis-Hastings procedure to employ appropriate proposals. Inheriting the
nature of MCMC, our tree-guided MCMC (tgMCMC) is guaranteed to converge, and
enjoys the fast convergence thanks to the effective proposals guided by trees.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the benefit

  training",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative models for deep learning are promising both to improve
understanding of the model, and yield training methods requiring fewer labeled
samples.
  Recent works use generative model approaches to produce the deep net's input
given the value of a hidden layer several levels above. However, there is no
accompanying ""proof of correctness"" for the generative model, showing that the
feedforward deep net is the correct inference method for recovering the hidden
layer given the input. Furthermore, these models are complicated.
  The current paper takes a more theoretical tack. It presents a very simple
generative model for RELU deep nets, with the following characteristics: (i)
The generative model is just the reverse of the feedforward net: if the forward
transformation at a layer is $A$ then the reverse transformation is $A^T$.
(This can be seen as an explanation of the old weight tying idea for denoising
autoencoders.) (ii) Its correctness can be proven under a clean theoretical
assumption: the edge weights in real-life deep nets behave like random numbers.
Under this assumption ---which is experimentally tested on real-life nets like
AlexNet--- it is formally proved that feed forward net is a correct inference
method for recovering the hidden layer.
  The generative model suggests a simple modification for training: use the
generative model to produce synthetic data with labels and include it in the
training set. Experiments are shown to support this theory of random-like deep
nets; and that it helps the training.

dominates over the spheroid at large galaxy radii, creating an inner ""bulge"" as
observed in most spiral galaxies. Here we show that decompositions in which the
disc remains embedded within the spheroid, labelled by some as ""unphysical"",
correctly reproduce both the photometric and kinematic properties of early-type
galaxies with intermediate-scale discs. Intermediate-scale discs have often
been confused with large-scale discs and incorrectly modelled as such; when
this happens, the spheroid luminosity is considerably underestimated. This has
recently led to some surprising conclusions, such as the claim that a number of
galaxies with intermediate-scale discs (Mrk 1216, NGC 1277, NGC 1271, and NGC
1332) host a central black hole whose mass is abnormally large compared to
expectations from the (underestimated) spheroid luminosity. We show that when
these galaxies are correctly modelled, they no longer appear as extreme
outliers in the (black hole mass)-(spheroid mass) diagram. This not only
nullifies the need for invoking different evolutionary scenarios for these
galaxies but it strengthens the significance of the observed (black hole
mass)-(spheroid mass) correlation and confirms its importance as a fundamental
ingredient for theoretical and semi-analytic models used to describe the
coevolution of spheroids and their central supermassive black holes.

stars are younger than unsaturated stars and show a broader spread of rotation
rates and x-ray activity. The unsaturated stars have magnetic fields and
rotation speeds that scale roughly with the square root of their age, though
possibly flattening for stars older than the sun. The connection between faster
rotators, stronger fields, and higher activity has been established
observationally, but a theory for the unified time-evolution of x-ray
luminosity, rotation, magnetic field and mass loss that captures the above
trends has been lacking. Here we derive a minimalist holistic framework for the
time evolution of these quantities built from combining a Parker wind with new
ingredients: (1) explicit sourcing of both the thermal energy launching the
wind and the x-ray luminosity via dynamo produced magnetic fields; (2) explicit
coupling of x-ray activity and mass loss saturation to dynamo saturation (via
magnetic helicity build-up and convection eddy shredding); (3) use of coronal
equilibrium to determine how magnetic energy is divided into wind and x-ray
contributions. For solar-type stars younger than the sun, we infer conduction
to be a subdominant power loss compared to x-rays and wind. For older stars,
conduction is more important, possibly quenching the wind and reducing angular
momentum loss. We focus on the time evolution for stars younger than the sun,
highlighting what is possible for further generalizations. Overall, the
approach shows promise toward a unified explanation of all of the

issues in modern AI problems. Unlike traditional uni-modal cases, where raw
features are extracted and directly measured, the heterogeneous nature of cross
modal tasks requires the intrinsic semantic representation to be compared in a
unified framework. This paper studies the learning of different representations
that can be retrieved across different modality contents. A novel approach for
mining cross-modal representations is proposed by incorporating explicit linear
semantic projecting in Hilbert space. The insight is that the discriminative
structures of different modality data can be linearly represented in
appropriate high dimension Hilbert spaces, where linear operations can be used
to approximate nonlinear decisions in the original spaces. As a result, an
efficient linear semantic down mapping is jointly learned for multimodal data,
leading to a common space where they can be compared. The mechanism of ""feature
up-lifting and down-projecting"" works seamlessly as a whole, which accomplishes
crossmodal retrieval tasks very well. The proposed method, named as shared
discriminative semantic representation learning (\textbf{SDSRL}), is tested on
two public multimodal dataset for both within- and inter- modal retrieval. The
experiments demonstrate that it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in
most scenarios.

Previous approaches either discover plans by maximally ""matching"" observed

infer plans by executing domain models to best explain the observed actions,
assuming complete domain models are available. In real world applications,
however, target plans are often not from plan libraries and complete domain

complete domain models are often difficult or expensive. In this paper we view
plan libraries as corpora and learn vector representations of actions using the

to characterize the conditional distribution of a high-resolution output given

point estimates achieve impressive performance, but soon they suffer from the
regression-to-the-mean problem, result of their inability to capture the
multi-modality of this conditional distribution. Modeling high-dimensional
image and audio distributions is a hard task, requiring both the ability to
model complex geometrical structures and textured regions. In this paper, we
propose to use as conditional model a Gibbs distribution, where its sufficient
statistics are given by deep convolutional neural networks. The features
computed by the network are stable to local deformation, and have reduced
variance when the input is a stationary texture. These properties imply that
the resulting sufficient statistics minimize the uncertainty of the target

filters of the CNN are initialized by multiscale complex wavelets, and then we
propose an algorithm to fine-tune them by estimating the gradient of the

intensively studied over the last decade with the aim of finding circumstellar
material (CSM), which is an indirect probe of the progenitor system. However,
it is difficult to deconvolve CSM components from non-variable, and often
dominant, components created by interstellar material (ISM). We present a
series of high-resolution spectra of SN Ia 2014J from before maximum brightness
to ~250 days after maximum brightness. The late-time spectrum provides unique
information for determining the origin of the Na I D absorption systems. The
deep late-time observation allows us to probe the environment around the SN at
a large scale, extending to ~40 pc. We find that a spectrum of diffuse light in
the vicinity, but not directly in the line-of-sight, of the SN has absorbing
systems nearly identical to those obtained for the ""pure"" SN line-of-sight.
Therefore, basically all Na I D systems seen toward SN 2014J must originate
from foreground material that extends to at least ~40 pc in projection and none
at the CSM scale. A fluctuation in the column densities at a scale of ~20 pc is
also identified. After subtracting the diffuse, ""background"" spectrum, the
late-time SN Na I D profile along the SN line-of-sight is consistent with the
profile in the near-maximum brightness spectra. The lack of variability on a ~1

1960s, has now been used widely in various digital products such as cameras,
cell phones, radars, etc. The method samples an input signal at a rate higher
than the Nyquist rate, thus achieves great robustness to quantization noise.
Compressed Sensing (CS) is a frugal acquisition method that utilizes the
possible sparsity of the signals to reduce the required number of samples for a
lossless acquisition. One can deem the reduced number as an effective
dimensionality of the set of sparse signals and accordingly, define an
effective oversampling rate as the ratio between the actual sampling rate and
the effective dimensionality. A natural conjecture is that the error of Sigma
Delta quantization, previously shown to decay with the vanilla oversampling
rate, should now decay with the effective oversampling rate when carried out in
the regime of compressed sensing. Confirming this intuition is one of the main
goals in this direction.
  The study of quantization in CS has so far been limited to proving error
convergence results for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian sensing matrices, as the
number of bits and/or the number of samples grow to infinity. In this paper, we
provide a first result for the more realistic Fourier sensing matrices. The
major idea is to randomly permute the Fourier samples before feeding them into
the quantizer. We show that the random permutation can effectively increase the
low frequency power of the measurements, thus enhance the quality of
$\Sigma\Delta$ quantization.

in computer vision recently. Many state of the art methods naively use holistic
visual features with language features into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
module, neglecting the sophisticated interaction between them. This coarse
modeling also blocks the possibilities of exploring finer-grained local
features that contribute to the question answering dynamically over time.
  This paper addresses this fundamental problem by directly modeling the
temporal dynamics between language and all possible local image patches. When
traversing the question words sequentially, our end-to-end approach explicitly
fuses the features associated to the words and the ones available at multiple
local patches in an attention mechanism, and further combines the fused
information to generate dynamic messages, which we call episode. We then feed
the episodes to a standard question answering module together with the
contextual visual information and linguistic information. Motivated by recent
practices in deep learning, we use auxiliary loss functions during training to
improve the performance. Our experiments on two latest public datasets suggest
that our method has a superior performance. Notably, on the DARQUAR dataset we
advanced the state of the art by 6$\%$, and we also evaluated our approach on

the radio-frequency (RF) signals energy to extend its lifetime. Moreover, to
prevent eavesdropping, artificial noise (AN) is exploited by FD-BS to degrade
the channel of the idle user, as well as to provide energy supply to the idle
user. To maximize the sum of downlink secrecy rate and uplink secrecy rate, we
jointly optimize the information covariance matrix, AN covariance matrix and
receiver vector, under the constraints of the sum transmission power of FD-BS
and the minimum harvested energy of the idle user. Since the problem is

variables, we observe records with the exact same input $x^u$, but different

prediction interval estimation methods do not use representations that can
accurately model such inherent noise in the case of nominal inputs. We propose
a new prediction interval estimation method tailored for this type of data,
which is prevalent in biology and medicine. We call this method Distribution
Adaptive Prediction Interval Estimation given Nominal inputs (DAPIEN) and has
four main phases. First, we select a distribution function that can best
represent the inherent noise of the system for all unique inputs. Then we infer
the parameters $\theta_i$ (e.g. $\theta_i=[mean_i, variance_i]$) of the
selected distribution function for all unique input vectors $x^u_i$ and
generate a new corresponding training set using pairs of $x^u_i, \theta_i$.
III). Then, we train a model to predict $\theta$ given a new $x_u$. Finally, we
calculate the prediction interval for a new sample using the inverse of the
cumulative distribution function once the parameters $\theta$ is predicted by
the trained model. We compared DAPIEN to the commonly used Bootstrap method on
three synthetic datasets. Our results show that DAPIEN provides tighter
prediction intervals while preserving the requested coverage when compared to
Bootstrap. This work can facilitate broader usage of regression methods in
medicine and biology where it is necessary to provide tight prediction
intervals while preserving coverage when input variables are nominal.

  magnetic reconnection",,,,,"physics.space-ph astro-ph.EP physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an analysis of the electron dynamics during rapid island merging
in asymmetric magnetic reconnection. We consider a doubly periodic system with
two asymmetric transitions. The upper layer is an asymmetric Harris sheet
initially perturbed to promote a single reconnection site. The lower layer is a
tangential discontinuity that promotes the formation of many X-points,
separated by rapidly merging islands. Across both layers the magnetic field and
the density have a strong jump, but the pressure is held constant. Our analysis
focuses on the consequences of electron energization during island coalescence.
We focus first on the parallel and perpendicular components of the electron
temperature to establish the presence of possible anisotropies and
non-gyrotropies. Thanks to the direct comparison between the two different
layers simulated, we can distinguish three main types of behavior
characteristic of three different regions of interest. The first type
represents the regions where traditional asymmetric reconnections take place
without involving island merging. The second type of regions instead show
reconnection events between two merging islands. Finally, the third regions
identifies the regions between two diverging island and where typical signature
of reconnection is not observed. Electrons in these latter regions additionally
show a flat-top distribution resulting from the saturation of a two-stream
instability generated by the two interacting electron beams from the two
nearest reconnection points. Finally, the analysis of agyrotropy shows the
presence of a distinct double structure laying all over the lower side facing
the higher magnetic field region. The distinguishing features found for the
three types of regions investigated provide clear indicators to the recently
launched MMS NASA mission for investigating magnetopause reconnection involving
multiple islands.

expression that is related to bilinear models. The proposed new formulation of
EV accounts for shape and scale endmember changes while enforcing a smooth

outliers and copes with some types of EV and NL. The known constraints on the
parameter of each observation model are modeled via suitable priors. The
posterior distribution associated with each Bayesian model is optimized using a
coordinate descent algorithm which allows the computation of the maximum a

previously the relationship between tasks had to be user-defined in the form of

Mg. Both stellar generations are found at different evolutionary stages (e.g.,
the main-sequence turnoff, the subgiant branch, and the red giant branch). The
non detection of SG asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in several metal-poor
([Fe/H] < -1) GCs suggests that not all SG stars ascend the AGB phase, and that
failed AGB stars may be very common in metal-poor GCs. This observation
represents a serious problem for stellar evolution and GC formation/evolution
theories. We report fourteen SG-AGB stars in four metal-poor GCs (M 13, M 5, M
3, and M 2) with different observational properties: horizontal branch (HB)
morphology, metallicity, and age. By combining the H-band Al abundances
obtained by the APOGEE survey with ground-based optical photometry, we identify
SG Al-rich AGB stars in these four GCs and show that Al-rich RGB/AGB GC stars
should be Na-rich. Our observations provide strong support for present,
standard stellar models, i.e., without including a strong mass-loss efficiency,
for low-mass HB stars. In fact, current empirical evidence is in agreement with
the predicted distribution of FG and and SG stars during the He-burning stages

formulation which includes interface continuity conditions and is consistent
with the original variational formulation of the problem. The last formulation

  Coherent structure dynamics in vorticity and concentration fields",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper examines the mechanisms of coherent structure interactions in
spatially evolving turbulent free shear layers at different values of the
velocity ratio parameter {\lambda}=$(U_1-U_2)/(U_1+U_2)$, where $U_1$ and $U_2
(\leq U_1)$ are the free stream velocities on either side of the layer. The
study employs the point-vortex (or vortex-gas) model presented in part I
(arXiv:1509.00603) which predicts spreading rates that are in the close
neighborhood of results from most high Reynolds number experiments and 3D
simulations. The present (2D) simulations show that the well-known steep-growth
merger events among neighboring structures of nearly equal size (Brown & Roshko
1974) account for more than 70% of the overall growth at {\lambda}< 0.63.
However the relative contribution of such 'hard merger' events decreases
gradually with increasing {\lambda}, and accounts for only 27% of the total
growth at the single-stream limit ({\lambda} = 1). It is shown that the rest of
the contribution to layer growth is largely due to the increasing differential
in size between neighboring structures as {\lambda} increases from 0.6 to 1.0,
and takes place through two different routes. The first occurs via what may be
called 'soft' mergers, involving extraction of little patches or filaments of
vorticity over time from appreciably smaller (usually upstream) structures.
This is consistent with earlier computational work on asymmetric two-vortex
mergers (Yasuda & Flierl, 1995). The second route involves assimilation of
disorganized 'vortex dust', which contains remnants of disrupted earlier
structures not yet transferred to surviving ones. A combination of these
processes is shown to cause an apparently nearly continuous increase in
structure size with downstream distance at {\lambda} = 1, of the kind reported
by D'Ovidio & Coats (2013)and attributed to mixing transition ...

$10^{-5}$, and $10^{-7}$) from the main sequence up to the end of oxygen

  We confirm that rotation-induced mixing between the convective H-shell and
He-core enables an important production of primary $^{14}$N and $^{22}$Ne and
$s$-process at low metallicity. At low metallicity, even though the production
is still limited by the initial number of iron seeds, rotation enhances the
$s$-process production, even for isotopes heavier than strontium, by increasing
the neutron to seed ratio. The increase in this ratio is a direct consequence
of the primary production of $^{22}$Ne. Despite nuclear uncertainties affecting
the $s$-process production and stellar uncertainties affecting the
rotation-induced mixing, our results show a robust production of $s$ process at
low metallicity when rotation is taken into account. Considering models with a

consistency relations. Also we derive the field excursion formula for tachyon,
which shows that assisted inflation is in more safer side compared to the
single field case to validate effective field theory framework. Further we

$R_{c}$-band linear polarimetric observations were carried out between the end
of the plateau and the beginning of the nebular phases as noticed in the
photometric light curve. The contribution due to interstellar polarization
(ISP) was constrained by using couple of approaches, i.e. based upon the
observations of foreground stars lying within 5\arcmin\, and 10$\degr$ radius
of the SN location and also investigating the extinction due to the Milky Way
and host galaxy towards the SN direction. Our analysis revealed that in general
the intrinsic polarization of the SN is higher than the polarization values for
the foreground stars and exhibits an increasing trend during our observations.
After correcting the ISP of $\sim$0.6 per cent, the maximum intrinsic
polarization of SN~2013ej is found to be 2.14 $\pm$ 0.57 per cent. Such a
strong polarization has rarely been seen in Type II-P SNe. If this is the case,
i.e., the `polarization bias' effect is still negligible, the polarization
could be attributed to the asymmetry of the inner ejecta of the SN because the
ISP towards the SN location is estimated to be, at most, 0.6 per cent.

convolutional neural network (CNN) with a dynamic parameter layer whose weights
are determined adaptively based on questions. For the adaptive parameter
prediction, we employ a separate parameter prediction network, which consists
of gated recurrent unit (GRU) taking a question as its input and a
fully-connected layer generating a set of candidate weights as its output.
However, it is challenging to construct a parameter prediction network for a
large number of parameters in the fully-connected dynamic parameter layer of
the CNN. We reduce the complexity of this problem by incorporating a hashing
technique, where the candidate weights given by the parameter prediction
network are selected using a predefined hash function to determine individual
weights in the dynamic parameter layer. The proposed network---joint network
with the CNN for ImageQA and the parameter prediction network---is trained
end-to-end through back-propagation, where its weights are initialized using a
pre-trained CNN and GRU. The proposed algorithm illustrates the
state-of-the-art performance on all available public ImageQA benchmarks.

from standard finite element techniques, we do not modify or enrich the

physical properties such as mass and energy conservation. Special local
a~priori correction techniques at re-entrant corners lead to an improved
representation of the energy in the discrete system and can suppress the global
pollution effect. Local mass conservation can be achieved by an a~posteriori
correction to the finite element flux. This avoids artifacts in coupled

any fine tuning of the coupling between the chameleon and matter fields and
retains its screening ability in the solar system. We demonstrate this

all redshifts, forming single or multiple stars with a range of masses
determined by local magneto-hydrodynamics and gravity. The formation processes
for these cores, however, as well as their structures, temperatures, Mach
numbers, etc., and the boundedness and mass distribution functions of the
resulting stars, should depend on environment, as should the characteristic
mass, density, and column density at which cloud self-gravity dominates other
forces. Because the environments for high and low redshift star formation
differ significantly, we expect the resulting gas to stellar conversion details
to differ also. At high redshift, the universe is denser and more gas-rich, so
the active parts of galaxies are denser and more gas rich too, leading to
slightly shorter gas consumption timescales, higher cloud pressures, and
denser, more massive, bound stellar clusters at the high mass end. With shorter
consumption times corresponding to higher relative cosmic accretion rates, and
with the resulting higher star formation rates and their higher feedback
powers, the ISM has greater turbulent speeds relative to the rotation speeds,
thicker gas disks, and larger cloud and star complex sizes at the
characteristic Jeans length. The result is a more chaotic appearance at high
redshift, bridging the morphology gap between today's quiescent spirals and
today's major-mergers, with neither spiral nor major-merger processes actually
in play at that time. The result is also a thick disk at early times, and after
in-plane accretion from relatively large clump torques, a classical bulge.
Today's disks are thinner, and torque-driven accretion is slower outside of
inner barred regions. This paper reviews the basic processes involved with star
formation in order to illustrate its evolution over time and environment.

distributed nature of the computation which it approximates during its growth,
foraging and adaptation to a changing environment. Slime mould functions as a
living embodied computational material which can be influenced (or pro-
grammed) by the placement of external stimuli. The goal of exploiting this
material behaviour for unconventional computation led to the development of a
multi-agent approach to the ap- proximation of slime mould behaviour. The basis
of the model is a simple dynamical pattern formation mechanism which exhibits
self-organised formation and subsequent adaptation of collective transport
networks. The system exhibits emergent properties such as relaxation and
minimisation and it can be considered as a virtual computing material,
influenced by the external application of spatial concentration gradients. In
this paper we give an overview of this multi-agent approach to unconventional

application domains, together with concrete example ap- plications of material

from these two calculations demonstrates the lack of convergence in data for
n=4 from the smaller one. Comparison of results for the 564 CI/CC level
calculation with an earlier ICFT R-matrix calculation which used the exact same
CI expansion but truncated the CC expansion to only 200 levels demonstrates the
lack of convergence of the earlier data, particularly for n=3 levels. Also, we
find that the results of our 590 CC R-matrix calculation are significantly and
systematically larger than those of an earlier comparable Distorted
Wave-plus-resonances calculation. Thus, it is important still to take note of
the (lack of) convergence in both atomic structural and collisional data, even
in such a highly-charged ion as Fe $^{20+}$, and to treat resonances
non-perturbatively. This is of particular importance for Fe ions given their
importance in the spectroscopic diagnostic modelling of astrophysical plasmas.

type-dependent mutation. This paper is concerned with the evolution of
genealogical information forward in time. For this purpose we define and
analytically characterize a path-valued Markov process that contains in its
state at time $t$ the extended ancestral lines (adding genealogical distances)
of the population alive at time $t$. The main result is a representation for
the conditional distribution of the extended ancestral lines of a subpopulation
alive at a fixed time $T$ (present time) given the type information of the
subpopulation at time $T$ in terms of the distribution of the sample paths (up
to time $T$) of a special Markov process (different from the ancestral
selection graph) to which we refer as backward process. This representation
allows us both to prove that the extended ancestral lines converge in the limit
$T \to \infty$ if the type information converges in the limit $T \to \infty$
and to study the resulting limit of the extended ancestral lines by means of
the backward process. The limit theorem has two applications: First, we can
represent the stationary type distribution of the common ancestor type process
in terms of the equilibrium distribution of a functional of the backward
process, where in the two type case we recover the common ancestor process of
Fearnhead if we let the population size tend to infinity. Second, we obtain
that the conditioned genealogical distance of two individuals given the types
of the two individuals is distributed as a certain stopping time of a further
functional of the backward process which is a new approach towards a proof that
genealogical distances are stochastically smaller under selection.

suggesting that it is associated with nematic quantum critical fluctuations.
Our results indicate that thermal fluctuations from striped antiferromagnetic
order dominate the underdoped regime along the (110) direction. We argue that
either there is a strong coupling between the quantum critical fluctuations and
the fermions, or more exotically, a higher symmetry may be present around
optimal doping.

a benchmark dataset; including the number of class labels, ground truths

abstraction of each dataset; grouping those that present actions, interactions
and higher level semantic activities. The survey identifies key appearance and
pose based datasets, noting a tendency for simplistic, emphasized, or scripted
action classes that are often readily definable by a stable collection of
sub-action gestures. There is a clear lack of datasets that provide closely
related actions, those that are not implicitly identified via a series of poses
and gestures, but rather a dynamic set of interactions. We therefore propose a
novel dataset that represents complex conversational interactions between two
individuals via 3D pose. 8 pairwise interactions describing 7 separate
conversation based scenarios were collected using two Kinect depth sensors. The
intention is to provide events that are constructed from numerous primitive
actions, interactions and motions, over a period of time; providing a set of
subtle action classes that are more representative of the real world, and a
challenge to currently developed recognition methodologies. We believe this is

classification using 3D pose features and the attributed papers show this task
is indeed possible. The full dataset is made publicly available to the research

down. The application of the present result to a simple model of the Universe

advantages in information processing tasks. Examples include higher rates of
key distribution and random number generation. The main disadvantage of using
such multi-dimensional quantum systems is the increased complexity of the
experimental setup. Here, we analyze a not-so-obvious problem: the relation
between randomness certification and computational requirements of the
postprocessing of experimental data. In particular, we consider semi-device
independent randomness certification from an experiment using a four
dimensional quantum system to violate the classical bound of a random access
code. Using state-of-the-art techniques, a smaller quantum violation requires
more computational power to demonstrate randomness, which at some point becomes
impossible with today's computers although the randomness is (probably) still
there. We show that by dedicating more input settings of the experiment to
randomness certification, then by more computational postprocessing of the
experimental data which corresponds to a quantum violation, one may increase
the amount of certified randomness. Furthermore, we introduce a method that
significantly lowers the computational complexity of randomness certification.
Our results show how more randomness can be generated without altering the
hardware and indicate a path for future semi-device independent protocols to
follow.

solution that has 6 isometries albeit broken by a linear dilaton. We find that
the ABF background satisfies candidate type IIB scale invariance conditions
which for the R-R field strengths are of the second order in derivatives.
Surprisingly, we also find that the this background obeys an interesting
modification of the standard IIB supergravity equations that are first order in
derivatives of R-R fields. These modified equations explicitly depend on
Killing vectors of the ABF background and, although not universal, imply the
universal scale invariance conditions. Moreover, we show that it is precisely
the non-isometric dilaton of the T-dual solution that leads, after the
T-duality, to a modification of type II equations from their standard form. We
conjecture that the modified equations should follow from kappa-symmetry of the
eta-deformed model. All our observations apply also to eta-deformations of AdS3
x S3 and AdS2 x S2 models.

the turbulent streaks of the oblique bands and spots of transitional plane
Couette flow. A functional model is designed to mimic the coherent flow in the
streaks. The control parameters of the model are extracted from Direct
Numerical Simulations (DNS) statistical data. A Reynolds stress is proposed to
study the effect on the instability of this additional force maintaining the
baseflow. Local (quasi-parallel) temporal stability analysis is performed on
that model to investigate the linear development of the spanwise vorticity.
Results show that average profiles, even if they have an inflection, are
stable: the shear layers inside the velocity streaks are responsible for the
vorticity formation. Emphasis is put on the convective or absolute nature of
the instability, depending on the location in the band. This shows that a
transition from a convective to an absolute instability occurs in the zone in
between fully turbulent and laminar flow. The group velocity of the most
unstable modes compare well to the advection velocity of spanwise vorticity
measured in DNS. This investigation is completed by the global (non-parallel)
stability analysis of a typical band case. Eventually, the possible cycles of
sustainment of localised low Reynolds number turbulence of shear flows are
discussed in the light of these results.

twist families of elliptic curve $L$-functions, was introduced by Due\~nez,
Huynh, Keating, Miller and Snaith. The excised model is motivated by a formula
for central values of these $L$-functions in a paper by Kohnen and Zagier. This
formula indicates that for a finite set of $L$-functions from a family of
quadratic twists, the central values are all either zero or are greater than
some positive cutoff. The excised model imposes this same condition on the
central values of characteristic polynomials of matrices from $SO(2N)$.
Strangely, the cutoff on the characteristic polynomials that results in a
convincing model for the $L$-function zeros is significantly smaller than that
which we would obtain by naively transferring Kohnen and Zagier's cutoff to the
$SO(2N)$ ensemble. In this current paper we investigate a modification to the
excised model. It lacks the simplicity of the original excised ensemble, but it
serves to explain the reason for the unexpectedly low cutoff in the original
excised model. Additionally, the distribution of central $L$-values is
`choppier' than the distribution of characteristic polynomials, in the sense
that it is a superposition of a series of peaks: the characteristic polynomial
distribution is a smooth approximation to this. The excised model didn't
attempt to incorporate these successive peaks, only the initial cutoff. Here we
experiment with including some of the structure of the $L$-value distribution.
The conclusion is that a critical feature of a good model is to associate the
correct mass to the first peak of the $L$-value distribution.

propagation of cyclical magnetism in most models of dynamo action by rotating
convection. Such propagation provides a prominent, and puzzling constraint on
dynamo models. In the Sun, active regions emerge first at mid-latitudes, then
appear nearer the equator over the course of a cycle, but most previous
global-scale dynamo simulations have exhibited poleward propagation (if they
were cyclical at all). Here, we highlight some simulations in which the
direction of propagation of dynamo waves is altered primarily by an inversion
of the kinetic helicity throughout much of the interior, rather than by changes
in the differential rotation. This tends to occur in cases with a low Prandtl
number and internal heating, in regions where the local density gradient is
relatively small. We analyse how this inversion arises, and contrast it to the
case of convection that is either highly columnar (i.e., rapidly rotating) or
locally very stratified; in both of those situations, the typical profile of
kinetic helicity (negative throughout most of the northern hemisphere) instead
prevails.

temperature turns out to be independent of the chosen observable and
individually shows up in the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the

dependence on temperature and force by the PEL-properties of the quiescent
system. We furthermore critically discuss the relevance of effective

couplings in finite volume schemes, recursive finite size techniques, two-loop
renormalized perturbation theory and the (improved) gradient flow on the

characteristics in the non-dissipative limit, and by solving the full
dissipative eigenvalue problem using a high-resolution spectral method.
Gravito-inertial waves are found to obey a mixed-type second-order operator and
to be often focused around short-period attractors of characteristics or
trapped in a wedge formed by turning surfaces and boundaries. We also find
eigenmodes that show a weak dependence with respect to viscosity and heat
diffusion just like truly regular modes. Some axisymmetric modes are found
unstable and likely destabilized by baroclinic instabilities. Similarly, some
non-axisymmetric modes that meet a critical layer (or corotation resonance) can
turn unstable at sufficiently low diffusivities. In all cases, the instability
is driven by the differential rotation. For many modes of the spectrum, neat
power laws are found for the dependence of the damping rates with diffusion
coefficients, but the theoretical explanation for the exponent values remains
elusive in general. The eigenvalue spectrum turns out to be very rich and
complex, which lets us suppose an even richer and more complex spectrum for
rotating stars or planets that own a differential rotation driven by
baroclinicity.

fluences at 35 GHz and near-Earth proton fluences above 100 MeV in order to
find information on their sources and evaluate their diagnostic potential. A
correlation was found to be pronouncedly higher between the microwave and
proton fluences than between their peak fluxes. This fact probably reflects a
dependence of the total number of protons on the duration of the acceleration
process. In events with strong flares, the correlation coefficients of
high-energy proton fluences with microwave and soft X-ray fluences are higher
than those with the speeds of coronal mass ejections. The results indicate a
statistically larger contribution of flare processes to high-energy proton
fluxes. Acceleration by shock waves seems to be less important at high energies
in events associated with strong flares, although its contribution is probable
and possibly prevails in weaker events. The probability of a detectable proton
enhancement was found to directly depend on the peak flux, duration, and
fluence of the 35 GHz burst, while the role of the Big Flare Syndrome might be
overestimated previously. Empirical diagnostic relations are proposed.

nuclear accreting black holes (BHs) as those seed BHs from which supermassive
BHs could grow in the early Universe. We divide the sample into five complete
redshift bins up to $z=1.5$ and perform an X-ray stacking analysis using the
\textit{Chandra} COSMOS-Legacy survey data. After removing the contribution
from X-ray binaries and hot gas to the stacked X-ray emission, we still find an
X-ray excess in the five redshift bins that can be explained by nuclear
accreting BHs. This X-ray excess is more significant for $z<0.5$. At higher
redshifts, these active galactic nuclei could suffer mild obscuration, as
indicated by the analysis of their hardness ratios. The average nuclear X-ray
luminosities in the soft band are in the range 10$^{39}-10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
Assuming that the sources accrete at $\geq$ 1\% the Eddington rate, their BH
masses would be $\leq$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, thus in the intermediate-mass BH
regime, but their mass would be smaller than the one predicted by the
BH-stellar mass relation. If instead the sources follow the correlation between
BH mass and stellar mass, they would have sub-Eddington accreting rates of
$\sim$ 10$^{-3}$ and BH masses 1-9 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We thus
conclude that a population of intermediate-mass BHs exists in dwarf starburst
galaxies, at least up to $z$=1.5, though their detection beyond the local
Universe is challenging due to their low luminosity and mild obscuration unless
deep surveys are employed.

to wavelength-dependent fluence attenuation by tissue optical properties, an
effect that causes spectral corruption. Predictions of the spectral variations
of light fluence in tissue are challenging since the spatial distribution of
optical properties in tissue cannot be resolved in high resolution or with high
accuracy by current methods. Spectral corruption has fundamentally limited the
quantification accuracy of optical and optoacoustic methods and impeded the
long sought-after goal of imaging blood oxygen saturation (sO2) deep in
tissues; a critical but still unattainable target for the assessment of
oxygenation in physiological processes and disease. We discover a new principle
underlying light fluence in tissues, which describes the wavelength dependence
of light fluence as an affine function of a few reference base spectra,
independently of the specific distribution of tissue optical properties. This
finding enables the introduction of a previously undocumented concept termed
eigenspectra Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (eMSOT) that can effectively
account for wavelength dependent light attenuation without explicit knowledge
of the tissue optical properties. We validate eMSOT in more than 2000
simulations and with phantom and animal measurements. We find that eMSOT can
quantitatively image tissue sO2 reaching in many occasions a better than
10-fold improved accuracy over conventional spectral optoacoustic methods.
Then, we show that eMSOT can spatially resolve sO2 in muscle and tumor;
revealing so far unattainable tissue physiology patterns. Last, we related
eMSOT readings to cancer hypoxia and found congruence between eMSOT tumor sO2
images and tissue perfusion and hypoxia maps obtained by correlative

pure, stateless functional flows. This is true even when the constraints of
quantum mechanics are not fully respected (e.g. reversible and unitary
evolution). In sum, Gremlin allows both types of theorist to leverage each
other's constructs for the advancement of their respective disciplines.

many applications including cross-lingual retrieval and statistical machine
translation. This research explores our new methodologies for mining such data
from previously obtained comparable corpora. The task is highly practical since
non-parallel multilingual data exist in far greater quantities than parallel
corpora, but parallel sentences are a much more useful resource. Here we
propose a web crawling method for building subject-aligned comparable corpora
from e.g. Wikipedia dumps and Euronews web page. The improvements in machine
translation are shown on Polish-English language pair for various text domains.
We also tested another method of building parallel corpora based on comparable
corpora data. It lets automatically broad existing corpus of sentences from
subject of corpora based on analogies between them.

of multipliers (ADMM) for minimizing a nonconvex and possibly nonsmooth
objective function, $\phi(x_0,\ldots,x_p,y)$, subject to coupled linear
equality constraints. Our ADMM updates each of the primal variables
$x_0,\ldots,x_p,y$, followed by updating the dual variable. We separate the
variable $y$ from $x_i$'s as it has a special role in our analysis.
  The developed convergence guarantee covers a variety of nonconvex functions
such as piecewise linear functions, $\ell_q$ quasi-norm, Schatten-$q$
quasi-norm ($0<q<1$), minimax concave penalty (MCP), and smoothly clipped
absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty. It also allows nonconvex constraints such as
compact manifolds (e.g., spherical, Stiefel, and Grassman manifolds) and linear
complementarity constraints. Also, the $x_0$-block can be almost any lower
semi-continuous function.
  By applying our analysis, we show, for the first time, that several ADMM
algorithms applied to solve nonconvex models in statistical learning,
optimization on manifold, and matrix decomposition are guaranteed to converge.
  Our results provide sufficient conditions for ADMM to converge on (convex or
nonconvex) monotropic programs with three or more blocks, as they are special
cases of our model.
  ADMM has been regarded as a variant to the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM).
We present a simple example to illustrate how ADMM converges but ALM diverges
with bounded penalty parameter $\beta$. Indicated by this example and other
analysis in this paper, ADMM might be a better choice than ALM for some
nonconvex \emph{nonsmooth} problems, because ADMM is not only easier to
implement, it is also more likely to converge for the concerned scenarios.

holographic superconductors in the presence of Born-Infeld nonlinear
electrodynamics by taking the backreaction into account. We find that in the
presence of nonlinear gauge field, one can still employ the analytical method
when the backreaction is turned on. Our calculation is based on the
Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem, which is a variational method. For the
system under consideration, we obtain the relation between the critical
temperature and the charge density. We find that both backreaction and
Born-Infeld parameters decrease the critical temperature of the superconductor
and make the condensation harder. At the ned of paper, we calculate the
critical exponent associated with the condensation near the critical
temperature and find that it has the universal value $1/2$ of the mean field
theory.
