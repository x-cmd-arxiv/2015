Highly nonlinear dynamical regimes emerge in which increasing mobility either

M\'yrdalsj\""okull ice cap. The volcano has a large caldera with several active
geothermal areas. A peculiar cluster of long-period seismic events started on
Katla's south flank in July 2011, during an unrest episode in the caldera that
culminated in a glacier outburst. The seismic events were tightly clustered at
shallow depth in the Gvendarfell area, 4 km south of the caldera, under a small
glacier stream on the southern margin of M\'yrdalsj\""okull. No seismic events
were known to have occurred in this area before. The most striking feature of
this seismic cluster is its temporal pattern, characterized by regular
intervals between repeating seismic events, modulated by a seasonal variation.
Remarkable is also the stability of both the time and waveform features over a
long time period, around 3.5 years. No comparable examples have been found in
the literature. Both volcanic and glacial processes can produce similar
waveforms and therefore have to be considered as potential seismic sources.
Discerning between these two causes is critical for monitoring glacier-clad
volcanoes and has been controversial at Katla. For this new seismic cluster on
the south flank we regard volcano-related processes as more likely than glacial
ones for the following reasons: 1) the seismic activity started during an
unrest episode involving sudden melting of the glacier and a j\""okulhlaup; 2)
the glacier stream is small and stagnant; 3) the seismicity remains regular and
stable for years; 4) there is no apparent correlation with short-term weather
changes, such as rain storms. We suggest that a small, shallow hydrothermal
system was activated on Katla's south flank in 2011, either by a minor magmatic
injection or by changes of permeability in a local crack system.

groups and clusters in large survey data. In order to be as precise as
possible, they have to be carefully calibrated using mock catalogues.
  Aims. We create an accurate and robust description of the matter distribution
in the local Universe using the most up-to-date available data. This will
provide the input for a specific cosmological test planned as follow-up to this
work, and will be useful for general extragalactic and cosmological research.
  Methods. We created a set of galaxy group catalogues based on the 2MRS and
SDSS DR12 galaxy samples using a friends-of-friends based group finder
algorithm. The algorithm was carefully calibrated and optimised on a new set of
wide-angle mock catalogues from the Millennium simulation, in order to provide
accurate total mass estimates of the galaxy groups taking into account the
relevant observational biases in 2MRS and SDSS.
  Results. We provide four different catalogues (i) a 2MRS based group
catalogue; (ii) an SDSS DR12 based group catalogue reaching out to a redshift z
= 0.11 with stellar mass estimates for 70% of the galaxies; (iii) a catalogue
providing additional fundamental plane distances for all groups of the SDSS
catalogue that host elliptical galaxies; (iv) a catalogue of the mass
distribution in the local Universe based on a combination of our 2MRS and SDSS
catalogues.
  Conclusions. While motivated by a specific cosmological test, three of the
four catalogues that we produced are well suited to act as reference databases
for a variety of extragalactic and cosmological science cases. Our catalogue of
fundamental plane distances for SDSS groups provides further added value to
this paper.

N_F=2. This global symmetry includes both independent rotations of the left-

rotations that mix the left- and right-handed components of the quark fields.
It has been suggested by lattice simulations, however, that a symmetry of
mesons in the light quark sector upon the quasi-zero mode truncation from the
quark propagators is actually higher than SU(4), because the states from a
singlet and a 15-plet irreducible representations of SU(4) are also degenerate.
Here we demonstrate that classically QCD, ignoring irrelevant exact zero mode
contributions, has a SU(2N_F) symmetry. If effects of dynamical chiral symmetry
breaking and of anomaly are encoded in the same near-zero modes, then
truncation of these modes should restore a classical SU(2N_F) symmetry. Then we
show in a Lorentz- and gauge-invariant manner emergence of a bilocal SU(4)
\times SU(4) symmetry in mesons that contains a global SU(4) as a subgroup upon
truncation of the quasi-zero modes. We also demonstrate that the confining
Coulombic part of the QCD Hamiltonian has this bilocal symmetry. It explains
naturally a degeneracy of different irreducible representations of SU(4)

effective field theory up to next-to-leading order. The potential at this order
consists of contributions from one- and two-pseudoscalar-meson exchange
diagrams and from four-baryon contact terms without and with two derivatives.
SU(3) flavor symmetry is imposed for constructing the interaction in the $S=-2$
sector. Specifically, the couplings of the pseudoscalar mesons to the baryons
are fixed by SU(3) symmetry and, in general, also the contact terms are related
via SU(3) symmetry to those determined in a previous study of the $S=-1$
hyperon-nucleon interaction. The explicit SU(3) symmetry breaking due to the
physical masses of the pseudoscalar mesons ($\pi$, $K$, $\eta$) is taken into
account. It is argued that the $\Xi N$ interaction has to be relatively weak to
be in accordance with available experimental constraints. In particular, the
published values and upper bounds for the $\Xi^- p$ elastic and inelastic cross
sections apparently rule out a somewhat stronger attractive $\Xi N$ force and,
specifically, disfavor any near-threshold deuteron-like bound states in that
system.

is related to the recently proposed GrAMPA algorithm of Borgerding, Schniter,

numerical experiments indicate that Scampi can provide reconstruction
performance superior to both GrAMPA as well as convex approaches to TV
reconstruction. Finally, through exhaustive best-case experiments, we show that
in many cases the maximal performance of both Scampi and convex TV can be quite

for this correspondence remain an open question. Nevertheless, the proposed
algorithm remains more practical, as it requires far less parameter tuning to

subpopulation that is confined by dark matter minihalos and falling toward the

dark matter-dominated HVCs colliding with a weakly magnetized galactic disk.
Our HVCs have baryonic masses of $5 \times 10^6\,$M$_{\odot}$ and dark matter
minihalo masses of 0, $3 \times 10^8$, or $1 \times 10^9\,$M$_{\odot}$. They
are modeled on the Smith Cloud, which is said to have collided with the disk 70
Myr ago. We find that, in all cases, the cloud's collision with the galactic
disk creates a hole in the disk, completely disperses the cloud, and forms a
bubble-shaped structure on the far side of the disk. In contrast, when present,
the dark matter minihalo continues unimpeded along its trajectory. Later, as
the minihalo passes through the bubble structure and galactic halo, it accretes
up to $6.0 \times 10^5\,$M$_{\odot}$ in baryonic material, depending on the
strengths of the magnetic field and minihalo gravity. These simulations suggest
that if the Smith Cloud is associated with a dark matter minihalo and collided
with the Galactic disk, the minihalo has accreted the observed gas. However, if
the Smith Cloud is dark matter-free, it is on its first approach toward the
disk. These simulations also suggest that the dark matter is most concentrated
either at the head of the cloud or near the cloud, depending upon the strength
of the magnetic field, a point that could inform indirect dark matter searches.

cosmological studies when one tries to avoid domain wall energy domination

lower bounds on online algorithms with a limited amount of advice about the
future. As a consequence, we are able to translate decades of research on
randomized online algorithms to the advice complexity model. Doing so improves
significantly on the previous best advice complexity lower bounds for many
online problems, or provides the first known lower bounds. For example, if $n$
is the number of requests, we show that:
  (1) A paging algorithm needs $\Omega(n)$ bits of advice to achieve a
competitive ratio better than $H_k=\Omega(\log k)$, where $k$ is the cache
size. Previously, it was only known that $\Omega(n)$ bits of advice were
necessary to achieve a constant competitive ratio smaller than $5/4$.
  (2) Every $O(n^{1-\varepsilon})$-competitive vertex coloring algorithm must
use $\Omega(n\log n)$ bits of advice. Previously, it was only known that
$\Omega(n\log n)$ bits of advice were necessary to be optimal.
  For certain online problems, including the MTS, $k$-server, paging, list
update, and dynamic binary search tree problem, our results imply that
randomization and sublinear advice are equally powerful (if the underlying
metric space or node set is finite). This means that several long-standing open
questions regarding randomized online algorithms can be equivalently stated as
questions regarding online algorithms with sublinear advice. For example, we
show that there exists a deterministic $O(\log k)$-competitive $k$-server
algorithm with advice complexity $o(n)$ if and only if there exists a
randomized $O(\log k)$-competitive $k$-server algorithm without advice.
  Technically, our main direct product theorem is obtained by extending an
information theoretical lower bound technique due to Emek, Fraigniaud, Korman,

next-generation networks. This paper refers to a cellular system transmitting
layered multicast services to a multicast group of users. Reliability of
communications is ensured via different Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC)
techniques. We deal with a fundamental problem: the computational complexity of
the RLNC decoder. The higher the number of decoding operations is, the more the
user's computational overhead grows and, consequently, the faster the battery
of mobile devices drains. By referring to several sparse RLNC techniques, and
without any assumption on the implementation of the RLNC decoder in use, we
provide an efficient way to characterize the performance of users targeted by
ultra-reliable layered multicast services. The proposed modeling allows to
efficiently derive the average number of coded packet transmissions needed to
recover one or more service layers. We design a convex resource allocation
framework that allows to minimize the complexity of the RLNC decoder by jointly
optimizing the transmission parameters and the sparsity of the code. The
designed optimization framework also ensures service guarantees to
predetermined fractions of users. The performance of the proposed optimization
framework is then investigated in a LTE-A eMBMS network multicasting H.264/SVC

sampling a configuration according to some probability measure, a rotor walk is
a deterministic process: at each step it chooses the next unused rotor in its
current location, and uses it to jump to the neighboring vertex to which it
points.
  Rotor walks capture many aspects of the expected behavior of simple random
walks. However, this similarity breaks down for the property of having an
infinite excursion. In this paper we study that question for natural random
configuration models on regular trees. Our results suggest that in this context
the rotor model behaves like the simple random walk unless it is not ""close to""

decisions are acceptable in an application of machine learning. For example it
may be a legal requirement that a decision must not favour a particular group.
Alternatively it can be that that representation of data must not have
identifying information. We address these two related issues by learning
flexible representations that minimize the capability of an adversarial critic.
This adversary is trying to predict the relevant sensitive variable from the
representation, and so minimizing the performance of the adversary ensures
there is little or no information in the representation about the sensitive
variable. We demonstrate this adversarial approach on two problems: making
decisions free from discrimination and removing private information from
images. We formulate the adversarial model as a minimax problem, and optimize
that minimax objective using a stochastic gradient alternate min-max optimizer.
We demonstrate the ability to provide discriminant free representations for
standard test problems, and compare with previous state of the art methods for
fairness, showing statistically significant improvement across most cases. The
flexibility of this method is shown via a novel problem: removing annotations
from images, from unaligned training examples of annotated and unannotated
images, and with no a priori knowledge of the form of annotation provided to
the model.

The flow is generated in a layer of liquid metal by an electromagnetic forcing.
This forcing creates a quasi two-dimensional (2D) turbulence with strong
vertical vorticity. The turbulent flow contains much more energy than the
surface waves. In order to focus on the surface wave, the deformations induced
by the turbulent flow are removed. This is done by performing a coherent phase
averaging. For wavelengths smaller than the forcing lengthscale, we observe a
significant increase of the wavelength of the propagating wave that has not
been reported before. We suggest that it can be explained by the random
deflection of the wave induced by the velocity gradient of the turbulent flow.
Under this assumption, the wavelength shift is an estimate of the fluctuations
of deflection angle. The local measurements of the wave frequency far from the
wavemaker do not reveal such systematic behavior, although a small shift is
measured. Finally we quantify the damping enhancement induced by the turbulent
flow. We review various theoretical scaling laws proposed previously. Most of
them propose a damping that increases as the square of Froude number. In
contrast, our experimental results show a turbulent damping increasing linearly
with the Froude number. We interpret this linear behaviour as a balance between
the time spent by a wave to cross a turbulent structure with the turbulent
mixing time. The larger is the ratio of these 2 times, the more energy is
extracted from the progressive wave. Finally, mechanisms of energy exchange and
open issues are discussed and further studies are proposed.

and S, but up to 2 dex underabundances of refractory elements. The stars'
unusual surface abundances could be due to a selective accretion of volatile
gas over dust. It has been proposed that there is a correlation between the
Lambda Boo phenomenon and IR-excesses which are the result of a debris disk or
interstellar medium (ISM) interaction providing the accreting material. We
observe 70 or 100 and 160 $\mu$m excess emission around 9 confirmed Lambda Boo
stars with the Herschel Space Observatory, to differentiate whether the dust
emission is from a debris disk or an ISM bow wave. We find that 3/9 stars
observed host well resolved debris disks. While the remaining 6/9 are not
resolved, they are inconsistent with an ISM bow wave based on the dust emission
being more compact for its temperature and predicted bow wave models produce
hotter emission than what is observed. We find the incidence of bright
IR-excesses around Lambda Boo stars is higher than normal A-stars. To explain
this given our observations, we explore Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag as a
mechanism of accretion from a debris disk but find it insufficient. As an
alternative, we propose the correlation is due to higher dynamical activity in
the disks currently underway. Large impacts of planetesimals or a higher influx
of comets could provide enough volatile gas for accretion. Further study on the
transport of circumstellar material in relation to the abundance anomalies are
required to explain the phenomenon through external accretion.

asymptotics of the partition function for this model were identified in the
1980s by Donsker and Varadhan [6] in terms of the {\it{Pekar variational
formula}}, which coincides with the behavior of the partition function of the
{\it{polaron problem}} under strong coupling. Based on this, in 1986 Spohn [14]
made a heuristic observation that the strong coupling behavior of the polaron
path measure, on certain time scales, should resemble a process, named as the
{\it{Pekar process}}, whose distribution could somehow be guessed from the
limiting asymptotic behavior of the mean-field measures under interest, whose
rigorous analysis remained open. The present paper is devoted to a precise
analysis of these mean-field path measures and convergence of the normalized
occupation measures towards an explicit mixture of the maximizers of the Pekar
variational problem. This leads to a rigorous construction of the
aforementioned Pekar process and hence, is a contribution to the understanding
of the ""mean-field approximation"" of the polaron problem on the level of path
measures.
  The method of our proof is based on the compact large deviation theory
developed in [11], its extension to the uniform strong metric for the singular
Coulomb interaction carried out in [8], as well as an idea inspired by a
{\it{partial path exchange}} argument appearing in [1].

intermediate luminosity between giants and dwarfs with spectral types between
G0 to K3. The Mt Wilson spectroscopists identified about 90 such stars in their
1935 summary paper of spectroscopic absolute magnitudes for 4179 stars. Called
""subgiants"" by Str\""omberg, these 90 stars defined the group at the time. The
position of the Mt Wilson subgiants in the HR diagram caused difficulties in
comparisons of high weight trigonometric parallaxes being measured and with
Russell's prevailing evolution proposal, and critics questioned the reality of
the Mt Wilson subgiants. We compare, star-by-star, the Mt Wilson spectroscopic
absolute magnitudes of the 90 stars defining their sample against those
absolute magnitudes derived from Hipparcos (HIP) trigonometric parallaxes. We
address concerns over biases in the Mt Wilson calibration sample and biases
created by the adopted methodology for calibration. Historically, these
concerns were sufficient to discredit the discovery of subgiants in the Mt
Wilson sample. However, as shown here, the majority of the Mount Wilson stars
identified as subgiants that also have reliable HIP trigonometric parallaxes do
lie among the subgiant sequence in the HIP HR diagram. Moreover, no significant
offset is seen between the M(V) brightnesses derived from the Mt Wilson
spectroscopic parallaxes and the M(V) values derived from Hipparcos
trigonometric parallaxes with a fractional error of 10%, which confirms in an
impressive manner the efficacy of the original Mt Wilson assessments. The
existence of subgiants proved that Russell's contraction proposal for stellar
evolution from giants to the main sequence was incorrect. Instead, Gamow's 1944
unpublished conjecture that subgiants are post main-sequence stars just having
left the main sequence was very nearly correct but was a decade before its
time.

thanks in particular to its ability to nicely handle the structured constraints

known to be slow (sublinear) when the solution lies at the boundary. A simple
less-known fix is to add the possibility to take 'away steps' during
optimization, an operation that importantly does not require a feasibility
oracle. In this paper, we highlight and clarify several variants of the
Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm that have been successfully applied in
practice: away-steps FW, pairwise FW, fully-corrective FW and Wolfe's minimum
norm point algorithm, and prove for the first time that they all enjoy global
linear convergence, under a weaker condition than strong convexity of the
objective. The constant in the convergence rate has an elegant interpretation
as the product of the (classical) condition number of the function with a novel
geometric quantity that plays the role of a 'condition number' of the
constraint set. We provide pointers to where these algorithms have made a
difference in practice, in particular with the flow polytope, the marginal
polytope and the base polytope for submodular optimization.

Mining applications, which attempts to minimize the sum of the square of the

Here we propose a method of seeding the initial means based on factorizations
of higher order moments for bounded data. Our method takes $O\left(1\right)$
passes through the entire dataset to extract the initial set of means, and its
final cost can be proven to be within $O(\sqrt{K})$ of the optimal cost. We

considerable interest and has been extensively studied theoretically because of
its appealing simplicity: electrons interact with an intense laser field in
vacuum and can be continuously accelerated, provided they remain at a given
phase of the field until they escape the laser beam. But demonstrating this
effect experimentally has proved extremely challenging, as it imposes stringent
requirements on the conditions of injection of electrons in the laser field.
Here, we solve this long-standing experimental problem for the first time by
using a plasma mirror to inject electrons in an ultraintense laser field, and
obtain clear evidence of vacuum laser acceleration. With the advent of PetaWatt
class lasers, this scheme could provide a competitive source of very high
charge (nC) and ultrashort relativistic electron beams.

be reproduced by combining a low-metallicity galaxy template with a standard
AGN template. The host galaxy is represented by Haro 11, a compact, moderately
low metallicity, star-bursting galaxy that shares typical features of high-$z$
galaxies. For the vast majority of $z\gtrsim 5$ quasars, the AGN contribution
is well modeled by a standard empirical template with the contamination of star
formation in the infrared subtracted. Together, these two templates can
separate the contributions from the host galaxy and the AGN even in the case of
limited data points, given that this model has only two free parameters. Using
this method, we re-analyze 69 $z\gtrsim 5$ quasars with extensive Herschel
observations, and derive their AGN luminosities $L_{\rm AGN}$ in a range $\sim
(0.78-27.4) \times10^{13}\, L_{\odot}$, the infrared luminosities from star

AGN luminosity of the $z\gtrsim5$ quasar sample follows the correlation defined
by quasars at $z < 2.6$. We assume these quasar host galaxies maintain a
constant average SFR ($\sim620\, M_\odot/{\rm yr}$) during their mass assembly

\textit{LALInferenceBurst}. These steps compress the full data streams into a
set of Bayes factors for each event; through this process, we use elements from
information theory to minimize the amount of information regarding the

sufficiently captured by the template as to permit all further design to take

intermediate interactions. For strong interactions, the particle conductance
plateaux disappear and the spin conductance gets suppressed, confirming the

protoplanetary disk. Nevertheless, previous disk surveys did not - and could
not - consistently exclude binaries from their samples. We present a study
dedicated to investigating the frequency of ongoing disk accretion around
single stars in a star-forming region. We obtained near-infrared spectroscopy
of 54 low-mass stars selected from a high-angular resolution survey in the 2-3
Myr-old Chamaeleon I region to determine the presence of Brackett-$\gamma$
emission, taking the residual chance of undetected multiplicity into account,
which we estimate to be on the order of 30%. The result is compared with
previous surveys of the same feature in binary stars of the same region to
provide a robust estimate of the difference between the accretor fractions of
single stars and individual components of binary systems. We find Br$\gamma$
emission among $39.5^{+14.0}_{-9.9}$% of single stars, which is a significantly
higher fraction than for binary stars in Chamaeleon I. In particular, close
binary systems with separations <100 AU show emission in only
$6.5^{+16.5}_{-3.0}$% of the cases according to the same analysis. The emitter
frequency of wider binaries appears consistent with the single star value.
Interpreting Br$\gamma$ emission as a sign of ongoing accretion and correcting
for sensitivity bias, we infer an accretor fraction of single stars of
F_acc=$47.8^{+14.0}_{-9.9}$%. This is slightly higher but consistent with
previous estimates that do not clearly exclude binaries from their samples.
Through our robust and consistent analysis, we confirm that the fraction of
young single stars harboring accretion disks is much larger than that of close
binaries at the same age. Our findings have important implications for the
timescales of disk evolution and planet formation.

that penetrates into the stably stratified lower region. The fraction of

turbulent regime, this decrease reverses in two dimensions but continues
monotonically in three dimensions. The mean fluid temperature, which grows
proportionally to the heating rate ($H$) without convection, grows
proportionally to $H^{4/5}$ when convection is strong in both two and three

spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in 33 bands from the ultraviolet to the
far-infrared to investigate the impact of jet feedback on star formation
activity. These galaxies are massive, early-type galaxies with normal
gas-to-dust ratios, covering a range of optical and infrared colors. We find
that the star formation rate (SFR) is suppressed by a factor of ~3-6, depending
on how molecular gas mass is estimated. We suggest this suppression is due to
the shocks driven by the radio jets injecting turbulence into the interstellar
medium (ISM), which also powers the luminous warm H2 line emission.
Approximately 25% of the sample shows suppression by more than a factor of 10.
However, the degree of SFR suppression does not correlate with indicators of
jet feedback including jet power, diffuse X-ray emission, or intensity of warm
molecular H2 emission, suggesting that while injected turbulence likely impacts
star formation, the process is not purely parameterized by the amount of
mechanical energy dissipated into the ISM. Radio galaxies with shocked warm
molecular gas cover a wide range in SFR-stellar mass space, indicating that
these galaxies are in a variety of evolutionary states, from actively
star-forming and gas-rich to quiescent and gas-poor. SFR suppression appears to
have the largest impact on the evolution of galaxies that are moderately
gas-rich.

The Lagrangian approach allows one to classify individual objects (e.g.

adaptive manner. It can be applied directly to a halo sample which dramatically
reduces computational cost and potentially allows an application of this
classification scheme to observed galaxy samples. Finally, the Lagrangian

trans-series and Picard-Lefschetz theory to quantum mechanics and quantum field
theory. Resurgence connects local perturbative data with global topological
structure. In quantum mechanical systems, this program provides a constructive
relation between different saddles. For example, in certain cases it has been
shown that all information around the instanton saddle is encoded in
perturbation theory around the perturbative saddle. In quantum field theory,
such as sigma models compactified on a circle, neutral bions provide a
semi-classical interpretation of the elusive IR-renormalon, and fractional kink
instantons lead to the non-perturbatively induced gap, of order of the strong
scale. In the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, saddles must be
found by solving the holomorphic Newton's equation in the inverted
(holomorphized) potential. Some saddles are complex, multi-valued, and even
singular, but of finite action, and their inclusion is strictly necessary to
prevent inconsistencies. The multi-valued saddles enter either via resurgent
cancellations, or their phase is tied with a hidden topological angle. We
emphasize the importance of the destructive/constructive interference effects
between equally dominant saddles in the Lefschetz thimble decomposition. This
is especially important in the context of the sign problem.

observed that the brightest galaxy in fossil groups is typically brighter and
more massive than their counterparts in control groups. Fossil groups developed
their large magnitude gap between the brightest galaxies around 3.5 Gyr ago.
The brightest galaxy stellar masses of all groups show a notorious increment at
that time. By analysing the behaviour of the magnitude gap between the first
and the second, third, and fourth ranked galaxies, we found that at earlier
times, fossil groups comprised two large brightest galaxies with similar
magnitudes surrounded by much fainter galaxies, while in control groups these
magnitude gaps were never as large as in fossils. At early times, fossil groups
in the faint population were denser than non-fossil groups, then this trend
reversed, and finally they became similar at the present day. The mean number
of faint galaxies in non-fossil systems increases in an almost constant rate
towards later times, while this number in fossil groups reaches a plateau at
$z\sim0.6$ that lasts $\sim 2$ Gyr, and then starts growing again more rapidly.
The formation of fossil groups is defined at the very beginning of the groups
according to their galaxy luminosity sampling, which could be determined by
their merging rate at early times.

this [Fe/H] = -2.32 star. Noteworthy among the abundances are: [Co/Fe] = 0.14
and [Cu/Fe] = -0.83, in agreement with past studies abundance trends in this
and other low metallicity stars; and <[Sc,Ti,V/Fe]> = 0.31, which has not been
noted previously. A detailed examination of scandium, titanium, and vanadium

positively correlated in stars with [Fe/H] < -2; HD 84937 lies at the high end

  The paper deals with three communication problems: data delivery,convergecast

  It is already known that, without energy exchange, all three problems are
NP-complete even if the network is a line. Surprisingly, if we allow the agents

transition is reviewed in a pedagogical fashion. The rigidity that emerges in
crystals and glassy liquids is of the same fundamental origin. In both cases,
it corresponds with a breaking of the translational symmetry; analogies with
freezing transitions in spin systems can also be made. The common aspect of
these seemingly distinct phenomena is a spontaneous emergence of the molecular
field, a venerable and well-understood concept. In crucial distinction from
periodic crystallisation, the free energy landscape of a glassy liquid is
vastly degenerate, which gives rise to new length and time scales while
rendering the emergence of rigidity gradual. We obviate the standard notion
that to be mechanically stable a structure must be essentially unique; instead,
we show that bulk degeneracy is perfectly allowed but should not exceed a
certain value. The present microscopic description thus explains both
crystallisation and the emergence of the landscape regime followed by
vitrification in a unified, thermodynamics-rooted fashion. The article contains
a self-contained exposition of the basics of the classical density functional
theory and liquid theory, which are subsequently used to quantitatively
estimate, without using adjustable parameters, the key attributes of glassy
liquids, viz., the relaxation barriers, glass transition temperature, and
cooperativity size. These results are then used to quantitatively discuss many
diverse glassy phenomena, including: the intrinsic connection between the
excess liquid entropy and relaxation rates, the non-Arrhenius temperature

studies of the AGN feedback process and radio galaxy physics. A widely used
proxy for jet power is the extended radio luminosity. A number of empirical
methods have been used to calibrate a scaling relationship between jet power
(Q) and radio luminosity (L) of the form log(Q) = beta_L * log(L) + C. The
regression slope has typically been found to be beta_L ~ 0.7 - 0.8. Here we
show that the previously reported scaling relations are strongly affected by
the confounding variable, distance. We find that in a sample of FRI X-ray
cavity systems, after accounting for the mutual distance dependence, the jet
power and radio luminosity are only weakly correlated, with slope beta_L ~ 0.3:
significantly flatter than previously reported. We also find that in previously
used samples of high-power sources, no evidence for an intrinsic correlation is
present when the effect of distance is accounted for. Using a simple model we
show that beta_L is expected to be significantly lower in samples of FRI radio
galaxies than it is for FRIIs, due to the differing dynamics for these two
classes of radio source. For FRI X-ray cavity systems the model predicts beta_L
(FRI) ~ 0.5 in contrast to FRII radio galaxies, for which beta_L(FRII) ~ 0.8.

tetravalent Tb4+(4f7) substituting for Ir4+ (rather than Sr2+) completely
suppresses the long-range collinear AFM transition but retains the insulating
state, leading to a phase diagram featuring a decoupling of magnetic
interactions and charge gap. The insulating state at x=0.03 is characterized by
an unusually large specific heat at low temperatures and an incommensurate
magnetic state having magnetic peaks at (0.95, 0, 0) and (0, 0.95, 0) in the

apparent that Tb doping effectively changes the relative strength of the SOI

the SOI, and destabilizes the AFM state. However, the disappearance of the AFM
accompanies no metallic state chiefly because an energy level mismatch for the
Ir and Tb sites weakens charge carrier hopping and renders a persistent
insulating state. This work highlights an unconventional correlation between
the AFM and insulating states in which the magnetic transition plays no
critical role in the formation of the charge gap in the iridate.

problems under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). A celebrated
result of Backurs and Indyk (STOC'15) proves that the Edit Distance of two
sequences of length n cannot be computed in strongly subquadratic time under
SETH. The result was extended by follow-up works to simpler looking problems
like finding the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).
  SETH is a very strong assumption, asserting that even linear size CNF
formulas cannot be analyzed for satisfiability with an exponential speedup over
exhaustive search. We consider much safer assumptions, e.g. that such a speedup
is impossible for SAT on much more expressive representations, like NC
circuits. Intuitively, this seems much more plausible: NC circuits can
implement complex cryptographic primitives, while CNFs cannot even
approximately compute an XOR of bits.
  Our main result is a surprising reduction from SAT on Branching Programs to
fundamental problems in P like Edit Distance, LCS, and many others. Truly
subquadratic algorithms for these problems therefore have consequences that we
consider to be far more remarkable than merely faster CNF SAT algorithms. For
example, SAT on arbitrary o(n)-depth bounded fan-in circuits (and therefore
also NC-Circuit-SAT) can be solved in (2-eps)^n time.
  A very interesting feature of our work is that we can prove major
consequences even from mildly subquadratic algorithms for Edit Distance or LCS.
For example, we show that if we can shave an arbitrarily large polylog factor
from n^2 for Edit Distance then NEXP does not have non-uniform NC^1 circuits. A
more fine-grained examination shows that even shaving a $\log^c{n}$ factor, for
a specific constant $c \approx 10^3$, already implies new circuit lower bounds.

to accurately and efficiently solve volume and boundary integral equations in

hierarchical compression and inversion scheme for matrices arising from the
discretization of integral equations. For a broad range of problems,
computational and storage costs of the inversion scheme are extremely modest
$O(\log N)$ and once the inverse is computed, it can be applied in $O(N \log
N)$.
  We analyze the QTT ranks for hierarchically low rank matrices and discuss its
relationship to commonly used hierarchical compression techniques such as FMM
and HSS. We prove that the QTT ranks are bounded for translation-invariant
systems and argue that this behavior extends to non-translation invariant
volume and boundary integrals.
  For volume integrals, the QTT decomposition provides an efficient direct
solver requiring significantly less memory compared to other fast direct
solvers. We present results demonstrating the remarkable performance of the
QTT-based solver when applied to both translation and non-translation invariant
volume integrals in 3D.
  For boundary integral equations, we demonstrate that using a QTT
decomposition to construct preconditioners for a Krylov subspace method leads
to an efficient and robust solver with a small memory footprint. We test the
QTT preconditioners in the iterative solution of an exterior elliptic boundary
value problem (Laplace) formulated as a boundary integral equation in complex,

have skewed rating distributions. However, these may both be true in any given

compare with bottomside ESF. AMISR-14 had five beams perpendicular to the

determining which are chosen as targets for the search for life beyond the
Solar system. One of the many variables that will be considered in that
characterisation and selection process is the nature of the potential climatic
variability of the exoEarths in question.
  In our own Solar system, the Earth's long-term climate is driven by several
factors - including the modifying influence of life on our atmosphere, and the
temporal evolution of Solar luminosity. The gravitational influence of the
other planets in our Solar system add an extra complication - driving the
Milankovitch cycles that are thought to have caused the on-going series of
glacial and interglacial periods that have dominated Earth's climate for the
past few million years.
  Here, we present the results of a large suite of dynamical simulations that
investigate the influence of the giant planet Jupiter on the Earth's
Milankovitch cycles. If Jupiter was located on a different orbit, we find that
the long-term variability of Earth's orbit would be significantly different.
Our results illustrate how small differences in the architecture of planetary
systems can result in marked changes in the potential habitability of the
planets therein, and are an important first step in developing a means to
characterise the nature of climate variability on planets beyond our Solar
system.

break a degeneracy between the gravitational fields of the disc and the dark
halo by estimating the disc surface density. This is done by combining
measurements of the vertical velocity dispersion of the disc with the disc
scale height. The vertical velocity dispersion of the discs is measured from
absorption lines (near the V-band) of near-face-on spiral galaxies, with the
light coming from a mixed population of giants of all ages. However, the scale
heights for these galaxies are estimated statistically from near-IR surface
photometry of edge-on galaxies. The scale height estimate is therefore
dominated by a population of older (> 2 Gyr) red giants. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of measuring the velocity dispersion for the same
older population of stars that is used to estimate the vertical scale height.
We present an analysis of the vertical kinematics of K-giants in the solar
vicinity. We find the vertical velocity distribution best fit by two components
with dispersions of 9.6 +/- 0.5 km/s and 18.6 +/- 1.0 km/s, which we interpret
as the dispersions of the young and old disc populations respectively.
Combining the (single) measured velocity dispersion of the total young + old
disc population (13.0 +/- 0.1 km/s) with the scale height estimated for the
older population would underestimate the disc surface density by a factor of ~
2. Such a disc would have a peak rotational velocity that is only 70% of that
for the maximal disc, thus making it appear submaximal.

simulating the learning principle of humans/animals. A variety of SPL
realization schemes have been designed for different computer vision and

these applications. However, the investigation on its theoretical insight is
still a blank. To this issue, this study attempts to provide some new
theoretical understanding under the SPL scheme. Specifically, we prove that the
solving strategy on SPL accords with a majorization minimization algorithm
implemented on a latent objective function. Furthermore, we find that the loss

non-convex regularized penalty (NSPR) known in statistics and machine learning.
Such connection inspires us discovering more intrinsic relationship between SPL
regimes and NSPR forms, like SCAD, LOG and EXP. The robustness insight under
SPL can then be finely explained. We also analyze the capability of SPL on its
easy loss prior embedding property, and provide an insightful interpretation to
the effectiveness mechanism under previous SPL variations. Besides, we design a
group-partial-order loss prior, which is especially useful to weakly labeled
large-scale data processing tasks. Through applying SPL with this loss prior to
the FCVID dataset, which is currently one of the biggest manually annotated

first study the problem of depth estimation from a single image. In this

known, and formulate monocular depth estimation as a discrete-continuous
optimization problem, where the continuous variables encode the depth of the
superpixels in the input image, and the discrete ones represent relationships
between neighboring superpixels. The solution to this discrete-continuous
optimization problem is obtained by performing inference in a graphical model
using particle belief propagation. To handle video sequences, we then extend
our single image model to a two-frame one that naturally encodes short-range
temporal consistency and inherently handles dynamic objects. Based on the
prediction of this model, we then introduce a fully-connected pairwise CRF that
accounts for longer range spatio-temporal interactions throughout a video. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both the indoor and outdoor

classical source coding with quantum side information where the quantum side
information is observed by a helper and sent to the decoder via a classical
channel. We derive a single-letter characterization of the achievable rate

a measurement and a compression is suboptimal, and measurement compression
seems necessary to achieve the optimal rate region. We then study coded source
compression in the fully quantum regime, where two different scenarios are
considered depending on the types of communication channels between the
legitimate source and the receiver. We further allow entanglement assistance
from the quantum helper in both scenarios. We characterize the involved quantum
resources, and derive single-letter expressions of the achievable rate region.

boundary conditions is known to be a family of metrics labeled by two arbitrary
periodic functions, respectively left and right-moving. It turns out that there
exists an appropriate presymplectic form which vanishes on-shell. This promotes
this set of metrics to a phase space in which the Brown-Henneaux asymptotic
symmetries become symplectic symmetries in the bulk of spacetime. Moreover, any
element in the phase space admits two global Killing vectors. We show that the
conserved charges associated with these Killing vectors commute with the
Virasoro symplectic symmetry algebra, extending the Virasoro symmetry algebra
with two $U(1)$ generators. We discuss that any element in the phase space
falls into the coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro algebras and that each orbit is
labeled by the $U(1)$ Killing charges. Upon setting the right-moving function
to zero and restricting the choice of orbits, one can take a near-horizon
decoupling limit which preserves a chiral half of the symplectic symmetries.
Here we show two distinct but equivalent ways in which the chiral Virasoro
symplectic symmetries in the near-horizon geometry can be obtained as a limit
of the bulk symplectic symmetries.

universe. A critical issue for forming SMSs is stellar UV feedback, which may
limit the stellar mass growth via accretion. In this paper we study the
evolution of an accreting SMS and its UV emissivity under conditions of
realistic variable accretion from a self-gravitating circumstellar disc. First
we conduct a 2D hydrodynamical simulation to follow the long-term protostellar
accretion until the stellar mass exceeds $10^4~M_\odot$. The disc fragments due
to gravitational instability, creating a number of small clumps that rapidly
migrate inward to fall onto the star. The resulting accretion history is thus
highly time-dependent: short episodic accretion bursts are followed by longer,
relative quiescent phases. We show that the circumstellar disc for the
so-called direct collapse model is more unstable and generates greater
variability over shorter timescales than normal Pop III cases. We conduct a
post-process stellar evolution calculation using the obtained accretion
history. Our results show that, regardless of the strong variability of the
accretion rates, the stellar radius monotonically increases with almost
constant effective temperature at $T_{\rm eff} \simeq 5000$ K as the stellar
mass increases. The resulting UV feedback is too weak to hinder mass accretion
due to the low flux of stellar UV photons, thus verifying our implicit
assumption of no stellar feedback during the hydrodynamic simulations. The
insensitivity of stellar evolution to variable accretion is attributed to the
fact that typical timescales of variability, $\lesssim 10^3$ years, are too
short to affect the stellar structure. We argue that this evolution will
continue until the SMS eventually collapses to produce a massive black hole by
the general relativistic instability after the stellar mass reaches $\gtrsim
10^5~M_\odot$.

attacker. Many of these machines are infected without their owners' knowledge,

activities on the Internet (for example spam emails). Depending on its
topology, a botnet can have zero or more command and control (C&C) servers,
which are centralized machines controlled by the cybercriminal that issue
commands and receive reports back from the co-opted bots.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the command and control
infrastructure of one of the world's largest proprietary spamming botnets
between 2007 and 2012: Cutwail/Pushdo. We identify the key functionalities
needed by a spamming botnet to operate effectively. We then develop a number of
attacks against the command and control logic of Cutwail that target those
functionalities, and make the spamming operations of the botnet less effective.
This analysis was made possible by having access to the source code of the C&C
software, as well as setting up our own Cutwail C&C server, and by implementing
a clone of the Cutwail bot. With the help of this tool, we were able to
enumerate the number of bots currently registered with the C&C server,
impersonate an existing bot to report false information to the C&C server, and
manipulate spamming statistics of an arbitrary bot stored in the C&C database.
Furthermore, we were able to make the control server inaccessible by conducting
a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Our results may be used by law
enforcement and practitioners to develop better techniques to mitigate and
cripple other botnets, since many of findings are generic and are due to the
workflow of C&C communication in general.

efficiency when compared to its half-duplex (HD) counterpart. Interference
management, however, remains challenging in FD cellular networks, especially
when high disparity between uplink and downlink transmission powers exists. The
uplink performance can be particularly deteriorated when operating on channels
that are simultaneously occupied with downlink transmission. This paper
considers a cellular wireless system with partial spectrum overlap between the
downlink and uplink. The performance of the system becomes, therefore, a
function of the overlap fraction, as well as the power level of both the uplink
and downlink transmissions. The paper considers the problem of maximizing an
overall network utility to find the uplink/downlink transmission powers and the
spectrum overlap fraction between the uplink and downlink spectrum in each
cell, and proposes solving the problem using interior point method. Simulations
results confirm the vulnerability of the uplink performance to the FD
operation, and show the superiority of the proposed scheme over the FD and HD
schemes. The results further show that explicit uplink and downlink performance

produce (without further access to $A$) a multiplicative
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to $x^T A x$ for any desired query $x \in

positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices admit sketches of size
$\Theta(\epsilon^{-2} n)$, via the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, achieving the
""for each"" guarantee, namely, for each query $x$, with a constant probability
the sketch succeeds. (For the stronger ""for all"" guarantee, where the sketch
succeeds for all $x$'s simultaneously, again there are no non-trivial
sketches.)
  We design significantly better sketches for the important subclass of graph
Laplacian matrices, which we also extend to symmetric diagonally dominant
matrices. A sequence of work culminating in that of Batson, Spielman, and
Srivastava (SIAM Review, 2014), shows that by choosing and reweighting
$O(\epsilon^{-2} n)$ edges in a graph, one achieves the ""for all"" guarantee.
Our main results advance this front.
  $\bullet$ For the ""for all"" guarantee, we prove that Batson et al.'s bound is
optimal even when we restrict to ""cut queries"" $x\in \{0,1\}^n$.
  In contrast, previous lower bounds showed the bound only for {\em
spectral-sparsifiers}.
  $\bullet$ For the ""for each"" guarantee, we design a sketch of size $\tilde
O(\epsilon^{-1} n)$ bits for ""cut queries"" $x\in \{0,1\}^n$. We prove a
nearly-matching lower bound of $\Omega(\epsilon^{-1} n)$ bits. For general

Nonlinear convection waves in the flow field are realized due to the envisaged

perfectly known. However, in practice, receivers' positions might be
inaccurate, which leads to localization error of targets. We propose factor
graph (FG)-based belief propagation (BP) algorithms to locate the passive
targets and improve the position accuracy of receivers simultaneously. Due to
the nonlinearity of the likelihood function, messages on the FG cannot be
derived in closed form. We propose both sample-based and parametric methods to
solve this problem. In the sample-based BP algorithm, particle swarm
optimization is employed to reduce the number of particles required to
represent messages. In parametric BP algorithm, the nonlinear terms in messages
are linearized, which results in closed-form Gaussian message passing on FG.
The Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB) for passive targets localization with
uncertain receivers is derived to evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithms. Simulation results show that both the sample-based and parametric
BP algorithms outperform the conventional method and attain the proposed BCRB.
Receivers' positions can also be improved via the proposed BP algorithms.
Although the parametric BP algorithm performs slightly worse than the
sample-based BP method, it could be more attractive in practical applications
due to the significantly lower computational complexity.

represents the magnetisation discontinuities along the hysteresis loop of a

the small fluctuation segments and broadening of the spectrum. The study of the

populations of brain networks are investigated in order to characterize mental
diseases or processes. Those networks are usually represented as graphs built
from neuroimaging data and studied by means of graph analysis methods. The
typical machine learning approach to study these brain graphs creates a
classifier and tests its ability to discriminate the two populations. In
contrast to this approach, in this work we propose to directly test whether two
populations of graphs are different or not, by using the kernel two-sample test
(KTST), without creating the intermediate classifier. We claim that, in
general, the two approaches provides similar results and that the KTST requires
much less computation. Additionally, in the regime of low sample size, we claim
that the KTST has lower frequency of Type II error than the classification
approach. Besides providing algorithmic considerations to support these claims,
we show strong evidence through experiments and one simulation.

$\mu_{B}|\boldsymbol{B}|\gtrsim k_B T_e$, where $\mu_{B}$ is the Bohr magneton,

The spin paramagnetic deformation of a nonbarotropic magnetar with a linked
poloidal-toroidal magnetic field is calculated to be up to ${{\sim 10}}$ times
greater than the deformation caused solely by the Lorentz force. It depends on
the degree of Pauli blocking by conduction electrons and the propensity to form
magnetic domains, processes which are incompletely modelled at magnetar field
strengths. The star becomes more oblate, as the toroidal field component
strengthens. The result implies that existing classical predictions
underestimate the maximum strength of the gravitational wave signal from
rapidly spinning magnetars at birth. Turning the argument around, future
gravitational-wave upper limits of increasing sensitivity will place
ever-stricter constraints on the physics of Pauli blocking and magnetic domain
formation under magnetar conditions.

adopted three different sets of constraints and test how the derived parameters
depend upon the spectral regions (masks) used in SME. We developed and

effective temperatures derived by interferometry is achieved when spectrum
fitting includes the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, while for cooler stars the
choice of the mask does not affect the results. The derived atmospheric
parameters do not strongly depend on spectral resolution and S/N of the
observations, while the uncertainties in temperature and surface gravity
increase with increasing effective temperature, with minima at 50~K in Teff and

solutions based on priors tailored to specific application have been developed
in practical applications. In particular, sparsity models have provided
promising priors. However, in spite of empirical success of these methods in
many applications, existing analyses are rather limited in two main ways: by
disparity between the theoretical assumptions on the signal and/or measurement

is not a strong enough prior for identifiability in the blind deconvolution

enforces spectral flatness of the signals. Under this prior, we provide an
iterative algorithm that achieves guaranteed performance in blind deconvolution

predicted by theoretical studies, a similar change of the band structure is
expected for silicene, the closest analogue to graphene. We here report a study
of the atomic and electronic structures of hydrogenated silicene, so called
silicane. The ($\small 2\sqrt{3} \times 2\sqrt{3}$) phase of silicene on
Ag(111) was used in this study since it can be formed homogeneously across the
entire surface of the Ag substrate. Low energy electron diffraction and
scanning tunneling microscopy data clearly show that hydrogenation changes the
structure of silicene on Ag(111) resulting in a (1 $\times$ 1) periodicity with
respect to the silicene lattice. The hydrogenated silicene also exhibits a
quasi-regular ($\small 2\sqrt{3} \times 2\sqrt{3}$)-like arrangement of
vacancies. Angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy revealed two dispersive
bands which can be unambiguously assigned to silicane. The common top of these
bands is located at $\small \backsim$ 0.9 eV below the Fermi level. We find
that the experimental bands are closely reproduced by the theoretical band

plasma become essential in the evolution of SNRs. They decrease the thermal
pressure and essentially increase the density behind the shock. The presence of
ambient magnetic field may considerably alter the behavior of the
post-adiabatic SNRs comparing to hydrodynamic scenario. In the present paper,
the magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of radiative shocks in magnetic field are
performed. High plasma compression due to the radiative losses results also in
the prominent increase of the strength of the tangential component of magnetic
field behind the shock and the decrease of the parallel one. If the strength of
the tangential field before the shock is higher than about $3\mathrm{\mu G}$ it
prevents formation of the very dense thin shell. The higher the strength of the
tangential magnetic field the larger the thickness and the lower the maximum
density in the radiative shell. Parallel magnetic field does not affect the
distribution of the hydrodynamic parameters behind the shock. There are almost
independent channels of energy transformations: radiative losses are due to the
thermal energy, the magnetic energy increases by reducing the kinetic energy.
The large density and high strength of the perpendicular magnetic field in the
radiative shells of SNRs should result in considerable increase of the hadronic

red-giant star KIC 4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of the
dipole mixed modes obtained from {\it Kepler} observations. In order to
overcome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars,
we present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods to
extract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. We find not only
that the core rotates faster than the surface, confirming previous inversion
results generated for other red giants (Deheuvels et al. 2012,2014), but we
also estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core with
a spatial resolution of $\Delta r=0.001R$ and verify the hypothesis of a sharp
discontinuity in the inner stellar rotation (Deheuvels et al. 2014). The
results show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity of
about $\langle\Omega_c/2\pi\rangle=748\pm18$~nHz and provide evidence for an
angular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part of
the hydrogen burning shell; however we do not succeed to characterize the
rotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. The
angular velocity, from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burning
shell, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reaching
an average value in the convective envelope of
$\langle\Omega_s/2\pi\rangle=68\pm22$~nHz. Hence, the core in KIC~4448777 is
rotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope.
We conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficient
to infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the dense

simulated. Obtained by considering the quantum-gravitational effects, this
model would admit some cases of singularity-free cosmological spacetimes. It is
found, however, that in vacuum and scalar collapse, when f' or the physical
scalar field is strong enough, a black hole including a central singularity can
be formed. In addition, near the central singularity, gravity dominates the
repulsion from the potential, so that in some circumstances the Ricci scalar is
pushed to infinity by gravity. Therefore, the semiclassical effects as included
here do not avoid the singularity problem in general relativity. A strong
physical scalar field can prevent the Ricci scalar from growing to infinity.
Vacuum collapse for the RlnR model is explored, and it is observed that for
this model the Ricci scalar can also go to infinity as the central singularity
is approached. Therefore, this feature seems universal in vacuum and scalar
collapse in f(R) gravity.

Moreover, longer wavelength ultraviolet - optical continuum light curves appear
to be delayed with respect to shorter wavelength light curves. A simple way to
model these delays is by assuming thermal reprocessing of a variable point
source (a lamp post) by a blackbody accretion disc. We introduce a new method,
CREAM (\textbf{C}ontinuum \textbf{RE}processed \textbf{A}GN \textbf{M}arkov
Chain Monte Carlo), that models continuum variations using this lamp post
model. The disc light curves lag the lamp post emission with a time delay
distribution sensitive to the disc temperature-radius profile and inclination.
We test CREAM's ability to recover both inclination and product of black hole
mass and accretion rate $\mmdot$, and show that the code is also able to infer
the shape of the driving light curve. CREAM is applied to synthetic light
curves expected from 1000 second exposures of a 17th magnitude AGN with a 2m
telescope in Sloan g and i bands with signal to noise of 500 - 900 depending on
the filter and lunar phase. We also tests CREAM on poorer quality g and i light
curves with SNR = 100. We find in the high SNR case that CREAM can recover the
accretion disc inclination to within an uncertainty of 5 degrees and an
$\mmdot$ to within 0.04 dex.

developed low Rossby, low magnetic Prandtl number, convection-driven dynamo
model. This multiscale model represents an asymptotically exact form of an
$\alpha^2$ mean field dynamo model in which the small-scale convection is
represented explicitly by finite amplitude, single mode solutions. Both steady
and oscillatory convection are considered for a variety of horizontal
planforms. The kinetic helicity is observed to be a monotonically increasing
function of the Rayleigh number. As a result, very small magnetic Prandtl
number dynamos can be found for sufficiently large Rayleigh numbers. All
dynamos are found to be oscillatory with an oscillation frequency that
increases as the strength of the convection is increased and the magnetic
Prandtl number is reduced. Kinematic dynamo action is strongly controlled by
the profile of the helicity; single mode solutions which exhibit boundary layer
behavior in the helicity show a decrease in the efficiency of dynamo action due
to the enhancement of magnetic diffusion in the boundary layer regions. For a
given value of the Rayleigh number, lower magnetic Prandtl number dynamos are
excited for the case of oscillatory convection in comparison to steady
convection. With regards to planetary dynamos, these results suggest that the
low magnetic Prandtl number dynamos typical of liquid metals are more easily
driven by thermal convection than by compositional convection.

particular, the lower metallicity MC environments seem to be less favorable to
dust production and the frequency of carbonaceous dust features and complex
fullerene molecules is generally higher with decreasing metallicity. Here, I
present an observational review of the dust and molecular content in

by MINOS+, the continuation of the two-detector, on-axis, long-baseline
experiment based at Fermilab, and at the Soudan Underground Laboratory in
northern Minnesota. By searching for the deficit of muon neutrinos at the Far
Detector, MINOS/MINOS+ is sensitive to the atmospheric neutrino oscillation
parameters $\Delta m^{2}_{32}$ and $\theta_{23}$. By using the full MINOS data
set looking at both \numu disappearance and \nue appearance in both neutrino
and anti-neutrino configurations at the NuMI beam along with atmospheric
neutrino data recorded at the FD, MINOS has made the most precise measurement
of $\Delta m^{2}_{32}$. Using a full three-flavour framework and searching for
\nue appearance MINOS/MINOS+ gains sensitivity to $\theta_{13}$, the mass
hierarchy and the octant of $\theta_{23}$. Exotic phenomenon is also explored
with the MINOS detectors looking for non-standard interactions and sterile
neutrinos. The current MINOS+ era goals are to build on the previous MINOS
results improving the precision on the three-flavour oscillation parameter
measurements and strengthening the constraints placed on the sterile neutrino

metallic LiOsO$_3$ has generated a flurry of interest in the properties of
polar metals. Such materials are thought to be rare because free electrons
screen out the long-range electrostatic forces that favor a polar structure
with a dipole moment in every unit cell. In this work, we question whether
long-range electrostatic forces are always the most important ingredient in
driving polar distortions. We use crystal chemical models, in combination with
first-principles Density Functional Theory calculations, to explore the
mechanisms of inversion-symmetry breaking in LiOsO$_3$ and both insulating and
electron-doped ATiO$_3$ perovskites, A = Ba, Sr, Ca. Although electrostatic
forces do play a significant role in driving the polar instability of BaTiO$_3$
(which is suppressed under electron doping), the polar phases of CaTiO$_3$ and
LiOsO$_3$ emerge through a mechanism driven by local bonding preferences and
this mechanism is `resistant' to the presence of charge carriers. Hence, our
results suggest that there is no fundamental incompatibility between
metallicity and polar distortions. We use the insights gained from our
calculations to suggest design principles for new polar metals and promising
avenues for further research.

explore the origin of age and metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidal
galaxies. We find that a number of simulated dwarfs form ""outside-in"", with an
old, metal-poor population that surrounds a younger, more concentrated
metal-rich component, reminiscent of dwarf spheroidals like Sculptor or
Sextans. We focus on a few examples where stars form in two populations
distinct in age in order to elucidate the origin of these gradients. The
spatial distributions of the two components reflect their diverse origin; the
old stellar component is assembled through mergers, but the young population
forms largely in situ. The older component results from a first episode of star
formation that begins early but is quickly shut off by the combined effects of
stellar feedback and reionization. The younger component forms when a late
accretion event adds gas and reignites star formation. The effect of mergers is
to disperse the old stellar population, increasing their radius and decreasing
their central density relative to the young population. We argue that
dwarf-dwarf mergers offer a plausible scenario for the formation of systems
with multiple distinct populations and, more generally, for the origin of age
and metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidals.

on the maximal magnitude of the variables. The square-shaped isodensity contour
of this resulting marginal bivariate density can also be regarded as the
equally-weighted mixture of bivariate normal distributions over all possible

of generating random variables. We use this method to construct the higher

function of the maximum norm and is marginally normal, and the bivariate

completely binary. We test our approach on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ILSVRC2012
dataset, and systematically study the training dynamics of the binarization
process. Our approach can binarize the last layer representation without loss
of performance and binarize all the layers with reasonably small degradations.
The memory space that it saves may allow more sophisticated models to be
deployed, thus compensating the loss. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to report results on current deep network architectures using
complete binary middle representations. Given the learned representations, we
find that the firing or inhibition of a binary neuron is usually associated
with a meaningful interpretation across different classes. This suggests that
the semantic structure of a neural network may be manifested through a guided
binarization process.

data analysis that defines diffusion similarities by imposing a Markovian
process on the given dataset. Analysis by this process uncovers the intrinsic
geometric structures in the data. Recently, it was suggested to replace the
standard kernel by a measure-based kernel that incorporates information about
the density of the data. Thus, the manifold assumption is replaced by a more
general measure-based assumption.
  The measure-based diffusion kernel incorporates two separate independent
representations. The first determines a measure that correlates with a density
that represents normal behaviors and patterns in the data. The second consists
of the analyzed multidimensional data points.
  In this paper, we present a representation framework for data analysis of
datasets that is based on a closed-form decomposition of the measure-based
kernel. The proposed representation preserves pairwise diffusion distances that
does not depend on the data size while being invariant to scale. For a
stationary data, no out-of-sample extension is needed for embedding newly
arrived data points in the representation space. Several aspects of the
presented methodology are demonstrated on analytically generated data.

be used as simple coatings for effective splash prevention. Soft substrates

facts from text corpora, is the generation of training data for its relation
extractors. In this paper, we present a method that maximizes the effectiveness
of newly trained relation extractors at a minimal annotation cost. Manual
labeling can be significantly reduced by Distant Supervision, which is a method
to construct training data automatically by aligning a large text corpus with
an existing knowledge base of known facts. For example, all sentences
mentioning both 'Barack Obama' and 'US' may serve as positive training
instances for the relation born_in(subject,object). However, distant
supervision typically results in a highly noisy training set: many training
sentences do not really express the intended relation. We propose to combine
distant supervision with minimal manual supervision in a technique called
feature labeling, to eliminate noise from the large and noisy initial training
set, resulting in a significant increase of precision. We further improve on
this approach by introducing the Semantic Label Propagation method, which uses
the similarity between low-dimensional representations of candidate training
instances, to extend the training set in order to increase recall while
maintaining high precision. Our proposed strategy for generating training data
is studied and evaluated on an established test collection designed for
knowledge base population tasks. The experimental results show that the
Semantic Label Propagation strategy leads to substantial performance gains when
compared to existing approaches, while requiring an almost negligible manual
annotation effort.

$f(R,T)$ theory of gravity, with $R$ and $T$ standing for the Ricci scalar and
trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. Such an equation is a
generalization of the one obtained from general relativity, and the latter can
be retrieved for a certain limit of the theory. For the $f(R,T)=R+2\lambda T$
functional form, with $\lambda$ being a constant, we find that some physical
properties of the stars, such as pressure, energy density, mass and radius, are
affected when $\lambda$ is changed. We show that for a fixed central star
energy density, the mass of neutron and strange stars can increase with
$\lambda$. Concerning the star radius, it increases for neutron stars and it
decreases for strange stars with the increment of $\lambda$. Thus, in $f(R,T)$
theory of gravity we can push the maximum mass above the observational limits.
This implies that the equation of state cannot be eliminated if the maximum
mass within General Relativity lies below the limit given by observed pulsars.

Here we investigate how such a nonlocal interaction, which at a first
inspection would not be expected to lead to superfluid behavior, may be
tailored by acting upon the geometry of the photon fluid itself. Our models and
measurements show that restricting the laser profile and hence the photon fluid
to a strongly elliptical geometry modifies thermal diffusion along the major
beam axis and reduces the effective nonlocal interaction length by two orders
of magnitude. This in turn enables the system to display a characteristic trait
of superfluid flow: the nucleation of quantized vortices in the flow past an
extended physical obstacle. These results are general and apply to other
nonlocal fluids, such as dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, and show that
""thermal"" photon superfluids provide an exciting and novel experimental
environment for probing the nature of superfluidity, with applications to the
study of quantum turbulence and analogue gravity.

\rightarrow v'=0, j'$ transitions were obtained from scattering cross sections
previously computed with the close-coupling method by Song et al(2015).
Combining these with the rate coefficients for vibrational $v=1-5 \rightarrow
v' < v$ quenching obtained with the infinite-order sudden approximation, we
propose a new extrapolation scheme that yields the rate coefficients for
ro-vibrational $v=2-5,j=0-30 \rightarrow v',j'$ de-excitation. Cross sections
and rate coefficients for ro-vibrational $v=2, j=0-30 \rightarrow v'=1,j'$
transitions calculated with the close-coupling method confirm the effectiveness
of this extrapolation scheme. Our calculated and extrapolated rates are very
different from those that have been adopted in the modeling of many
astrophysical environments. The current work provides the most comprehensive
and accurate set of ro-vibrational de-excitation rate coefficients for the
astrophysical modeling of the H-CO collision system. Application of the
previously available and new data sets in astrophysical slab models shows that
the line fluxes typically change by 20-70% in high temperature environments
(800 K) with an H/H$_2$ ratio of 1; larger changes occur for lower
temperatures.

The turning of Scotland to the east is modelled by a three-dimensional
rotation. On the basis of different data sets of control points, the parameters
of the rotation are estimated by means of methods of adjustment theory.
Furthermore, a geodetic-statistical analysis method is applied to Scotland, by
which groups of places of homogenous distortions and modern counterparts of the
ancient places are determined. Based on the results of the investigations,
answers are given for questions concerning Ptolemaic positions unsolved so far.

  mental health awareness","This paper was edited and written with the help of Eric Ocelewski",,,,"physics.ed-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the shift of civilization from the Industrial Age to the Information
Age, mathematical literacy has become a necessity in the twenty-first century.
However, in order to learn and contribute to the mathematical community, one
has to be in a state of good mental health. When I say 'good mental health,' I
mean one has to develop a set of healthy coping strategies, be in a positive
learning environment, and have a social support system. Traditionally,
universities have been the venue of such higher learning. If these institutions
want to remain as thriving grounds for higher education and engines of
research, post-secondary institutions need to be aware of these factors and
actively contribute to the well-being of its students and faulty.
Unfortunately, students do not always receive the support necessary to be
mentally healthy. The purpose of this paper is to examine how social awareness
and sensitivity of mental health in a university setting is a key component for
individuals to flourish academically and grow personally. Several voluntary
surveys completed by my first and second year math students at the University
of Waterloo will be presented. The surveys investigated the students'
experiences at the university, particularly in the Mathematics Department. In
addition, this paper explores an alternative way to structure math classes,
specifically assignment scheduling, in order to help students develop healthy
study habits. The scores for the alternative-scheduled assignments are
statistically analyzed and compared to scores of the typical-scheduled
assignments currently implemented at the University of Waterloo. Finally, this
paper briefly discusses the importance of socialization, specifically for young
mathematicians and scientists, and potential consequences of reduced social
exposure in the Digital Age.

Disambiguation procedure by filtering the relevant senses of an ambiguous word
through Part-of-Speech Tagging. First, this proposed approach performs the
Part-of-Speech Tagging operation before the disambiguation procedure using
Bigram approximation. As a result, the exact Part-of-Speech of the ambiguous
word at a particular text instance is derived. In the next stage, only those
dictionary definitions (glosses) are retrieved from an online dictionary, which
are associated with that particular Part-of-Speech to disambiguate the exact
sense of the ambiguous word. In the training phase, we have used Brown Corpus
for Part-of-Speech Tagging and WordNet as an online dictionary. The proposed
approach reduces the execution time upto half (approximately) of the normal
execution time for a text, containing around 200 sentences. Not only that, we
have found several instances, where the correct sense of an ambiguous word is
found for using the Part-of-Speech Tagging before the Disambiguation procedure.

approaches use online dictionary for learning, and supervised approaches use
manual learning sets. Hand tagged data are populated which might not be
effective and sufficient for learning procedure. This limitation of information
is main flaw of the supervised approach. Our proposed approach focuses to
overcome the limitation using learning set which is enriched in dynamic way
maintaining new data. Trivial filtering method is utilized to achieve
appropriate training data. We introduce a mixed methodology having Modified
Lesk approach and Bag-of-Words having enriched bags using learning methods. Our
approach establishes the superiority over individual Modified Lesk and
