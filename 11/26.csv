f(\boldsymbol{X}_{p \times 1}^\intercal\boldsymbol{\beta}_0, \varepsilon)$,
support recovery is impossible when $\boldsymbol{X} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,
\mathbb{I}_{p \times p})$ and a model complexity adjusted sample size is below
a critical threshold. Recently, optimal algorithms based on Sliced Inverse
Regression (SIR) were suggested. These algorithms work provably under the
assumption that the design $\boldsymbol{X}$ comes from an i.i.d. Gaussian
distribution. In the present paper we analyze algorithms based on covariance
screening and least squares with $L_1$ penalization (i.e. LASSO) and
demonstrate that they can also enjoy optimal (up to a scalar) rescaled sample
size in terms of support recovery, albeit under slightly different assumptions
on $f$ and $\varepsilon$ compared to the SIR based algorithms. Furthermore, we
show more generally, that LASSO succeeds in recovering the signed support of
$\boldsymbol{\beta}_0$ if $\boldsymbol{X} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,
\boldsymbol{\Sigma})$, and the covariance $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ satisfies the
irrepresentable condition. Our work extends existing results on the support
recovery of LASSO for the linear model, to a more general class of SIMs.

modelocked laser frequency combs. But even with advances in laser technology,
modelocked laser combs remain bulk-component devices that are hand-assembled.
In contrast, a frequency comb based on the Kerr-nonlinearity in a dielectric
microresonator will enable frequency comb functionality in a micro-fabricated
and chip-integrated package suitable for use in a wide-range of environments.
Such an advance will significantly impact fields ranging from spectroscopy and
trace gas sensing, to astronomy, communications, atomic time keeping and
photonic data processing. Yet in spite of the remarkable progress shown over
the past years, microresonator frequency combs (""microcombs"") have still been
without the key function of direct f-2f self-referencing and phase-coherent
frequency control that will be critical for enabling their full potential. Here
we realize these missing elements using a low-noise 16.4 GHz silicon chip
microcomb that is coherently broadened from its initial 1550 nm wavelength and
subsequently f-2f self-referenced and phase-stabilized to an atomic clock. With
this advance, we not only realize the highest repetition rate octave-span
frequency comb ever achieved, but we highlight the low-noise microcomb
properties that support highest atomic clock limited frequency stability.

At first we will outline the
relation between spin squeezing, quantum metrology and entanglement detection,
with a particular focus on the last. We will derive spin squeezing criteria for
the detection of entanglement and its depth that outperform past approaches,
especially for unpolarized states, recently produced in experiments and object
of increasing interest in the community. Furthermore, we will extend the
original definition of spin squeezed states by providing a new parameter that
is thought to embrace different classes of states in a unified framework.
  Afterwards we consider a test of quantum principles in macroscopic objects
originally designed by Leggett and Garg. In this case the scenario consists of
a single party that is probed at different time instants and the quantum effect
detected is the violation of Macrorealism (MR), due to strong correlations in
time, rather than in space, between non-compatible observables. We will look at
the problems of inconclusiveness of the LG tests arising from possible
explanations of the results in terms of ``clumsy'' measurements, what has been
termed ``clumsiness loophole''.
  We propose first a scheme to test and possibly falsify (MR) in macroscopic
ensembles of cold atoms based on alternating Quantum Non-Demolition
measurements and coherent, magnetically-driven collective spin rotations. Then
we also propose a way to address the clumsiness loophole by introducing and
computing an invasivity quantifier to add to the original LG expression. We
provide numerical evidence that such a clumsiness-free test is feasible under
state-of-the-art realistic experimental parameters and imperfections.

emerge that could have low energy implications, most of them having a split

attractions of the remaining locally stable equilibria. This problem is rather
common especially in population dynamics models. Precisely, a particular
solution of a dynamical system is completely determined by its initial
condition and by the parameters involved in the model. Furthermore, when the
omega limit set reduces to a point, the trajectory of the solution evolves
towards the steady state. But, in case of multi-stability it is possible that
several steady states originate from the same parameter set. Thus, in these
cases the importance of accurately reconstruct the attraction basins follows.
In this paper we focus on dynamical systems of ordinary differential equations
presenting three stable equilibia and we design algorithms for the detection of
the points lying on the manifolds determining the basins of attraction and for
the reconstruction of such manifolds. The latter are reconstructed by means of
the implicit partition of unity method which makes use of radial basis

is very challenging given the high input data dimensionality and the relatively
small amount of available labeled data. Therefore, we propose the use of greedy
layer-wise unsupervised pre-training coupled with a highly efficient algorithm
for unsupervised learning of sparse features. The algorithm is rooted on sparse
representations and enforces both population and lifetime sparsity of the
extracted features, simultaneously. We successfully illustrate the expressive
power of the extracted representations in several scenarios: classification of
aerial scenes, as well as land-use classification in very high resolution
(VHR), or land-cover classification from multi- and hyper-spectral images. The
proposed algorithm clearly outperforms standard Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and its kernel counterpart (kPCA), as well as current state-of-the-art
algorithms of aerial classification, while being extremely computationally
efficient at learning representations of data. Results show that single layer
convolutional networks can extract powerful discriminative features only when
the receptive field accounts for neighboring pixels, and are preferred when the
classification requires high resolution and detailed results. However, deep
architectures significantly outperform single layers variants, capturing
increasing levels of abstraction and complexity throughout the feature
hierarchy.

expectation values in the first case, and in the second case, two of the
doublets remain without vev. The constraints on the parameter space at low
energy, including the measured value of the Higgs mass and the signal
strengths, oblique corrections and also measurements of relic density and
direct detection rates are juxtaposed with the conditions of vacuum stability,
perturbativity and unitarity at various scales. We find that the scenario with
three nonzero vevs is not valid beyond 107 GeV, assuming no additional physics
participates at the intermediate scales. On the contrary, the scenario with
only one nonzero vev turns out to be a successful model for cold dark matter
phenomenology, which also turns out to be valid up to the Planck scale at the

each case. Thus, the S3 symmetric scalar sector emerges as an ultraviolet

and that a Wronski-like matrix produced from some finite list of elements of
the algebra is invertible (analogous to the linear independence condition).
Then, it is shown that the set of operators whose kernels contain all of those
elements is the left ideal generated by an explicitly given operator. In other
words, an operator has those elements in its kernel if and only if it has that
generator as a right factor. Three examples demonstrate the application of this
result in different contexts, including one in which $\mathfrak{D}$ is an
automorphism of finite order.

applications impose delay constraints on each packet and require them to be in
order. To achieve fast in-order packet decoding, we have to compromise on the
throughput. We study this trade-off between throughput and smoothness in packet
decoding. We first consider a point-to-point streaming and analyze how the
trade-off is affected by the frequency of block-wise feedback, whereby the
source receives full channel state feedback at periodic intervals. We show that
frequent feedback can drastically improve the throughput-smoothness trade-off.
Then we consider the problem of multicasting a packet stream to two users. For
both point-to-point and multicast streaming, we propose a spectrum of coding
schemes that span different throughput-smoothness tradeoffs. One can choose an
appropriate coding scheme from these, depending upon the delay-sensitivity and
bandwidth limitations of the application. This work introduces a novel style of
analysis using renewal processes and Markov chains to analyze coding schemes.

environments. A desirable capability of these agents is to respond to
goal-oriented commands by autonomously constructing task plans. However, such
autonomy can add significant cognitive load and potentially introduce safety
risks to humans when agents behave unexpectedly. Hence, for such agents to be
helpful, one important requirement is for them to synthesize plans that can be
easily understood by humans. While there exists previous work that studied
socially acceptable robots that interact with humans in ""natural ways"", and
work that investigated legible motion planning, there lacks a general solution

of plan {\it explicability} and {\it predictability}. To compute these
measures, first, we postulate that humans understand agent plans by associating
abstract tasks with agent actions, which can be considered as a labeling
process. We learn the labeling scheme of humans for agent plans from training
examples using conditional random fields (CRFs). Then, we use the learned model
to label a new plan to compute its explicability and predictability. These
measures can be used by agents to proactively choose or directly synthesize
plans that are more explicable and predictable to humans. We provide
evaluations on a synthetic domain and with human subjects using physical robots

large fraction of Seyfert 1-1.5s. The origin of this feature remains debated,
as several models have been suggested to explain it, including warm
Comptonization and blurred ionized reflection. In order to constrain the origin
of this component, we exploit the different behaviors of these models above 10
keV. Ionized reflection covers a broad energy range, from the soft X-rays to
the hard X-rays, while Comptonization drops very quickly in the soft X-rays. We
present here the results of a study done on 102 Seyfert 1s (Sy 1.0, 1.2, 1.5
and NLSy1) from the Swift/BAT 70-Month Hard X-ray Survey catalog. The joint
spectral analysis of Swift/BAT and XMM-Newton data allows a hard X-ray view of
the soft excess that is present in about 80% of the objects of our sample. We
discuss how the soft-excess strength is linked to the reflection at high
energy, to the photon index of the primary continuum and to the Eddington
ratio. In particular, we find a positive dependence of the soft-excess
intensity on the Eddington ratio. We compare our results to simulations of
blurred ionized-reflection models and show that they are in contradiction. By
stacking both XMM-Newton and Swift/BAT spectra per soft-excess strength, we see
that the shape of reflection at hard X-rays stays constant when the soft excess
varies, showing an absence of link between reflection and soft excess. We
conclude that the ionized-reflection model as the origin of the soft excess is
disadvantaged in favor of the warm Comptonization model in our sample of
Seyfert 1s.

incorporate the effects of the lowest-order post-Newtonian corrections to the
equations of motion. In addition, terms describing the loss of orbital energy
and angular momentum due to the 5/2-order post-Newtonian terms are included. In
the steady state, captures are found to occur in two regimes that are clearly
differentiated in terms of energy, or semimajor axis; these two regimes are
naturally characterized as ""plunges"" (low binding energy) and ""EMRIs,"" or
extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (high binding energy). The capture rate, and the
distribution of orbital elements of the captured objects, are presented for two
steady-state models based on the Milky Way: one with a relatively high density
of remnants and one with a lower density. In both models, but particularly in
the second, the steady-state energy distribution and the distribution of
orbital elements of the captured objects are substantially different than if
the Bahcall-Wolf energy distribution were assumed. The ability of classical
relaxation to soften the blocking effects of the Schwarzschild barrier is
quantified.These results, together with those of Papers I-III, suggest that a
Fokker-Planck description can adequately represent the dynamics of collisional
loss cones in the relativistic regime.

three articles by Dorothy Wrinch and Sir Harold Jeffreys (1919, 1921, 1923).
However, our historical investigation also suggests that in 1932 J. B. S.
Haldane made an important contribution to the development of the Bayes factor
by proposing the use of a mixture prior comprising a point mass and a
continuous probability density. Jeffreys was aware of Haldane's work and it may
have inspired him to pursue a more concrete statistical implementation for his
conceptual ideas. It thus appears that Haldane may have played a much bigger
role in the statistical development of the Bayes factor than has hitherto been
assumed.

with the resonant case: we prove a result of instability for a generic

hold true even for a generic perturbation. The case where the frequency is
non-resonant is more subtle. Our second result shows that for a generic
perturbation, the KAM theorem holds true. Concerning the Nekhrosohev theorem,
it is known that one has stability over an exponentially long interval of time,
and that this cannot be improved for all perturbations. Our third result shows
that for a generic perturbation, one has stability for a doubly exponentially

very uniform. However, a fraction of 20-70% (increasing with decreasing
metallicity) exhibit dramatic enhancements in their abundances of carbon - the
so-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. A key question for Galactic
chemical evolution models is whether this non-standard composition reflects
that of the stellar natal clouds, or is due to local, post-birth mass transfer
of chemically processed material from a binary companion; CEMP stars should
then all be members of binary systems. Our aim is to determine the frequency
and orbital parameters of binaries among CEMP stars with and without
over-abundances of neutron-capture elements - CEMP-s and CEMP-no stars,
respectively - as a test of this local mass-transfer scenario. This paper
discusses a sample of 24 CEMP-no stars, while a subsequent paper will consider
a similar sample of CEMP-s stars. Most programme stars exhibit no statistically
significant radial-velocit variation over this period and appear to be single,
while four are found to be binaries with orbital periods of 300-2,000 days and
normal eccentricity; the binary frequency for the sample is 17+-9%. The single
stars mostly belong to the recently-identified ``low-C band'', while the
binaries have higher absolute carbon abundances. We conclude that the
nucleosynthetic process responsible for the strong carbon excess in these
ancient stars is unrelated to their binary status; the carbon was imprinted on
their natal molecular clouds in the early Galactic ISM by an even earlier,
external source, strongly indicating that the CEMP-no stars are likely bona
fide second-generation stars. We discuss potential production sites for carbon
and its transfer across interstellar distances in the early ISM, and
implications for the composition of high-redshift DLA systems. Abridged.

annotated textual similarity datasets drawn both from the same distribution as
the training data and from a wide range of other domains. We find that the most
complex architectures, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural
networks, perform best on the in-domain data. However, in out-of-domain
scenarios, simple architectures such as word averaging vastly outperform LSTMs.
Our simplest averaging model is even competitive with systems tuned for the
particular tasks while also being extremely efficient and easy to use.
  In order to better understand how these architectures compare, we conduct
further experiments on three supervised NLP tasks: sentence similarity,
entailment, and sentiment classification. We again find that the word averaging
models perform well for sentence similarity and entailment, outperforming
LSTMs. However, on sentiment classification, we find that the LSTM performs
very strongly-even recording new state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford

these supervised tasks, using them both as a prior and as a black box feature

compute the vertical (F_z) and radial (F_R) components of the gravitational
force, as well as Gamma(z), defined as the radial derivative of V_c^2, with
V_c^{2}= -RF_R. If we assume that the thick disk does not flare and that all
the components of the velocity dispersion tensor of the thick disk have a
uniform radial scalelength of 3.5 kpc, Gamma takes implausibly large negative
values, when using the currently available kinematical data of the thick disk.
This implies that the input parameters or the model assumptions must be
revised. We have explored, using a simulated thick disk, the impact of the
assumption that the scale lengths of the density and velocity dispersions do
not depend on the vertical height z above the midplane. In the lack of any
information about how these scale radii depend on z, we define a different
strategy. By using a parameterized Galactic potential, we find that acceptable
fits to F_z, F_R and Gamma are obtained for a flaring thick disk and a
spherical dark matter halo with a local density larger than 0.0064 M_sun
pc^{-3}. Disk-like dark matter distributions might be also compatible with the
current data of the thick disk. A precise measurement of Gamma at the midplane
could be very useful to discriminate between models.

interpolated from coarser levels. We show that the impact this has on the

even smaller at higher redshift. The impact on halo properties is also small
($\lesssim 3\%$ for abundance, profiles, mass; and $\lesssim 0.05\%$ for
positions and velocities). The method can boost the performance of modified

expected from mass-dependent post main sequence evolution. We here establish an
empirical relation between these quantities by drawing on 1,475 red giants with
asteroseismic mass estimates from Kepler that also have spectroscopic labels
from APOGEE DR12. We assess the accuracy of our model, and find that it
predicts stellar masses with fractional r.m.s. errors of about 14% (typically
0.2 Msun). From these masses, we derive ages with r.m.s errors of 40%. This

range 1-13 Gyr) for vast numbers of giant stars across the Galaxy. We apply our
model to 52,000 stars in APOGEE DR12, for which no direct mass and age

KEPLER and APOGEE surveys, samples of several thousand stars exist with
high-quality spectra and asteroseismic masses. Here we show that from these

determine stellar masses to $\sim$ 0.07 dex from APOGEE DR12 spectra of red
giants; these imply age estimates accurate to $\sim$ 0.2 dex (40 percent). We
show that The Cannon constrains these ages foremost from spectral regions with
CN absorption lines, elements whose surface abundances reflect mass-dependent

20,000 red-clump stars) with mass and age estimates, spanning the entire disk

in the spectra is not simply a corollary of the birth-material abundances

spectral cover employing the group law on the elliptic curve in the heterotic
theory. We find in explicit examples that there are three different classes of
heterotic duals that have U(1) factors in their low energy effective theories:
split spectral covers describing bundles with S(U(m) x U(1)) structure group,
spectral covers containing torsional sections that seem to give rise to bundles

in bound clusters), with higher star-formation rate density galaxies having
higher $\Gamma$ values. Within individual galaxies, there is evidence for
$\Gamma$ to vary by a factor of 3-4, likely following the molecular gas surface
density, in agreement with recent predictions. Finally, we discuss cluster
disruption and its effect on the observed properties of a population, focussing
on the age distribution of clusters. We briefly discuss the expectations of
theoretical and numerical studies, and also the observed distributions in a
number of galaxies. Most observational studies now find agreement with
theoretical expectations, namely nearly a constant cluster age distribution for
ages up to ~100 Myr (i.e. little disruption), and a drastic steepening above
this value caused by a combination of cluster disruption and incompleteness.
Rapid cluster disruption for clusters with ages < 100 Myr is ruled out for most
galaxies.

frequencies of orbits in both axisymmetric and triaxial potentials. The methods
are separated into two classes. Unless an orbit has been trapped by a
resonance, convergent, or iterative, methods are able to recover the actions to
arbitrarily high accuracy given sufficient computing time. Faster
non-convergent methods rely on the potential being sufficiently close to a
separable potential and the accuracy of the action estimate cannot be improved
through further computation. We critically compare the accuracy of the methods
and the required computation time for a range of orbits in an axisymmetric
multi-component Galactic potential. We introduce a new method for estimating
actions that builds on the adiabatic approximation of Sch\""onich & Binney
(2012) and discuss the accuracy required for the actions, angles and
frequencies using suitable distribution functions for the thin and thick discs,
the stellar halo and a star stream. We conclude that for studies of the disc
and smooth halo component of the Milky Way the most suitable compromise between
speed and accuracy is the St\""ackel Fudge, whilst when studying streams the
non-convergent methods do not offer sufficient accuracy and the most suitable
method is computing the actions from an orbit integration via a generating

Some of the most popular ones include galaxy interactions (IT) and disk
instabilities (DI). Using an advanced semi analytic model (SAM) of galaxy
formation, coupled to accurate halo occupation distribution modeling, we
investigate the imprint left by each separate triggering process on the
clustering strength of AGN at small and large scales. Our main results are as
follows: i) DIs, irrespective of their exact implementation in the SAM, tend to
fall short in triggering AGN activity in galaxies at the center of halos with
$M_h>10^{13.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. On the contrary, the IT scenario predicts
abundance of active, central galaxies that generally agrees well with
observations at every halo mass. ii) The relative number of satellite AGN in
DIs at intermediate-to-low luminosities is always significantly higher than in
IT models, especially in groups and clusters. The low AGN satellite fraction
predicted for the IT scenario might suggest that different feeding modes could
simultaneously contribute to the triggering of satellite AGN. iii) Both
scenarios are quite degenerate in matching large-scale clustering measurements,
suggesting that the sole average bias might not be an effective observational
constraint. iv) Our analysis suggests the presence of both a mild luminosity
and a more consistent redshift dependence in the AGN clustering, with AGN
inhabiting progressively less massive dark matter halos as the redshift
increases. We also discuss the impact of different observational selection cuts
in measuring AGN clustering, including possible discrepancies between optical
and X-ray surveys.

in regimes that historically have required fluid approaches, such as
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), two-fluid, or Boltzmann electron treatments. In
particular, SLPIC allows an explicit time advance with steps much larger than
the inverse plasma frequency, avoiding the instability explicit PIC faces with
large timesteps. SLPIC avoids this instability by slowing down fast particles
(e.g., electrons) in a way that is rigorously underpinned by an approximate
Vlasov equation; unlike MHD, two-fluid, and Boltzmann electron approaches,
SLPIC does not fundamentally neglect any first-principles plasma physics,
although the choices of grid cell size, timestep, and number of macroparticles
per cell naturally limit the physical phenomena that can be accurately
represented. SLPIC can be implemented with minor modifications of a standard
PIC code and does not require an implicit time advance. It enables large
timesteps in first-principles kinetic plasma simulation of appropriately slow
phenomena, and it can handle many of the same complications as PIC, such as
boundary conditions and collisions. In an argon plasma sheath test problem, a
SLPIC simulation achieved a speed-up of a factor of 160 over the corresponding

system? Diversification of a single chemotaxis system could serve as an
alternative, or even evolutionary stepping-stone, to switching between multiple
systems. We hypothesized that mutations in gene regulation could lead to
heritable control of chemotactic diversity. By simulating foraging and
colonization of E. coli using a single-cell chemotaxis model, we found that
different environments selected for different behaviors. The resulting
trade-offs show that populations facing diverse environments would ideally
diversify behaviors when time for navigation is limited. We show that
advantageous diversity can arise from changes in the distribution of protein
levels among individuals, which could occur through mutations in gene
regulation. We propose experiments to test our prediction that chemotactic
diversity in a clonal population could be a selectable trait that enables
adaptation to environmental variability.

value sent by a transmitter, despite a subset of $b$ processes behaving in an
arbitrary, i.e. Byzantine, manner and sending corrupted messages to all
processes in the system. It is well known that the problem has a solution in a
(an eventually) synchronous message passing distributed system iff the number
of processes in the Byzantine subset is less than one third of the total number
of processes, i.e. iff $n > 3b+1$. The rest of the processes are expected to be
correct: they should never deviate from the algorithm assigned to them and send
corrupted messages. But what if they still do?
  We show in this paper that it is possible to solve Byzantine agreement even
if, beyond the $ b$ ($< n/3 $) Byzantine processes, some of the other processes
also send corrupted messages, as long as they do not send them to all. More
specifically, we generalize the classical Byzantine model and consider that
Byzantine failures might be partial. In each communication step, some of the
processes might send corrupted messages to a subset of the processes. This
subset of processes - to which corrupted messages might be sent - could change
over time. We compute the exact number of processes that can commit such
faults, besides those that commit classical Byzantine failures, while still
solving Byzantine agreement. We present a corresponding Byzantine agreement
algorithm and prove its optimality by giving resilience and complexity bounds.

planes of cuprate superconductors has long been recognized. Less attention has
been paid to the screening of the charge transfer by the intervening ionic
layers. We address this issue in the case of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, where CuO
chains supply the holes for the planes. We present a simple
dielectric-screening model that gives a linear correlation between the relative
displacements of ions along the $c$ axis, determined by neutron powder
diffraction, and the hole density of the planes. Applying this model to the
temperature dependent shifts of ions along the $c$ axis, we infer a charge
transfer of 5-10% of the hole density from the planes to the chains on warming
from the superconducting transition to room temperature. Given the significant
coupling of $c$-axis displacements to the average charge density, we point out
the relevance of local displacements for screening charge modulations and note
recent evidence for dynamic screening of in-plane quasiparticles. This line of
argument leads us to a simple model for atomic displacements and charge
modulation that is consistent with images from scanning-tunneling microscopy
for underdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$.

and specificity. However, despite this wealth of information, we still have
little understanding of what really drives the processes behind urbanisation.
In this thesis we apply some ideas from statistical physics to the study of
cities.
  We first present a stochastic, out-of-equilibrium model of city growth that
describes the structure of the mobility pattern of individuals. The model
explains the appearance of secondary subcenters as an effect of traffic
congestion, and predicts a sublinear increase of the number of centers with
population size. Within the framework of this model, we are further able to
give a prediction for the scaling exponent of the total distance commuted
daily, the total length of the road network, the total delay due to congestion,
the quantity of CO2 emitted, and the surface area with the population size of
cities. In the third part, we focus on the quantitative description of the
patterns of residential segregation. We propose a unifying theoretical
framework in which segregation can be empirically characterised. In the fourth
and last part, we succinctly present the most important---theoretical and
empirical---results of our studies on spatial networks.
  Throughout this thesis, we try to convey the idea that the complexity of
cities is -- almost paradoxically -- better comprehended through simple
approaches. Looking for structure in data, trying to isolate the most important
processes, building simple models and only keeping those which agree with data,
constitute a universal method that is also relevant to the study of urban
systems.

for numerical operator splittings provide error estimates in finite-time

Furthermore, they give rise to an a posteriori representation of the error

analysis is the derivation of a path-space information criterion for comparison
(and possibly design) of numerical schemes, in analogy to classical information
criteria for model selection and discrimination. In the context of Parallel
KMC, our analysis allows us to select schemes with improved numerical error and
more efficient processor communication. We expect that such a path-space
information perspective on numerical methods will be broadly applicable in
stochastic dynamics, both for the finite and the long-time regime.

approximating the Helmholtz equation (or other linear wave equations) using
piecewise defined local solutions of the equation to approximate the global
solution. When coefficients in the equation (for example, the refractive index)
are piecewise constant it is common to use plane waves on each element. However
when the coefficients are smooth functions of position, plane waves are no
longer directly applicable. In this paper we show how Generalized Plane Waves
(GPWs) can be used in a modified TDG scheme to approximate the solution for
piecewise smooth coefficients. GPWs are approximate solutions to the equation
that reduce to plane waves when the medium through which the wave propagates is
constant. We shall show how to modify the TDG sesquilinear form to allow us to
prove convergence of the GPW based version. The new scheme retains the high
order convergence of the original TDG scheme (when the solution is smooth) and
also retains the same number of degrees of freedom per element (corresponding
to the directions of the GPWs). Unfortunately it looses the advantage that only
skeleton integrals need to be performed. Besides proving convergence, we
provide numerical examples to test our theory.

differences of aggregate spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of various
subsets of $\sim$4000 low-redshift R-AGN from Best & Heckman (2012) with
respect to (currently) inactive control samples selected to have matching
redshift, stellar mass, population age, axis ratio, and environment. Aggregate
SEDs, ranging from the ultraviolet (UV) through mid-infrared (mid-IR, 22
$\mu$m), were constructed using a Bayesian method that eliminates biases from
non-detections in GALEX and WISE. We study rare high-excitation sources
separately from low-excitation ones, which we split by environment and host
properties. We find that both the UV and mid-IR emission of non-cluster R-AGNs
(80% of sample) are suppressed by $\sim$0.2 dex relative to that of the control
group, especially for moderately massive galaxies (log $M_* \lesssim$ 11). The
difference disappears for high-mass R-AGN and for R-AGN in clusters, where
other, non-AGN quenching/maintenance mechanisms may dominate, or where the
suppression of SF due to AGN may persist between active phases of the central
engine, perhaps because of the presence of a hot gaseous halo storing AGN
energy. High-excitation (high accretion rate) sources, which make up 2% of the
R-AGN sample, also show no evidence of SF suppression (their UV is the same as
in controls), but they exhibit a strong mid-IR excess due to AGN dust heating.

within $\lesssim10\%$ for both dark matter only and non-radiative runs, with
individual objects showing code-to-code scatter of $\lesssim0.1$ dex, although
the gas in non-radiative simulations shows significant scatter. Including
feedback physics significantly increases the diversity. Subhalo mass and
$V_{max}$ distributions vary by $\approx20\%$. The galaxy populations also show
striking code-to-code variations. Although the Tully-Fisher relation is similar
in almost all codes, the number of galaxies with $10^{9}M_\odot/h\lesssim
M_*\lesssim 10^{12}M_\odot/h$ can differ by a factor of 4. Individual galaxies
show code-to-code scatter of $\sim0.5$ dex in stellar mass. Moreover, strong
systematic differences exist, with some codes producing galaxies $70\%$ smaller

feedback. Our results combined with our companion papers demonstrate that
subgrid physics is not just subject to fine-tuning, but the complexity of
building galaxies in all environments remains a challenge. We argue even basic

forthcoming fifth generation (5G) cellular networks which enables the
decoupling of infrastructure from the services it provides. In this case, the
roles of infrastructure providers (InPs) and mobile virtual network operators
(MVNOs) can be logically separated and the resources (e.g., subchannels, power,
and antennas) of a base station owned by an InP can be transparently shared by
multiple MVNOs, while each MVNO virtually owns the entire BS. Naturally, the
issue of resource allocation arises. In particular, the InP is required to
abstract the physical resources into isolated slices for each MVNO who then
allocates the resources within the slice to its subscribed users. In this
paper, we aim to address this two-level hierarchical resource allocation
problem while satisfying the requirements of efficient resource allocation,
strict inter-slice isolation, and the ability of intra-slice customization. To
this end, we design a hierarchical combinatorial auction mechanism, based on
which a truthful and sub-efficient resource allocation framework is provided.
Specifically, winner determination problems (WDPs) are formulated for the InP
and MVNOs, and computationally tractable algorithms are proposed to solve these
WDPs. Also, pricing schemes are designed to ensure incentive compatibility. The
designed mechanism can achieve social efficiency in each level even if each
party involved acts selfishly. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme.

phase transitions in scalar models. These transitions are found to exhibit rich
phenomena, though they are controlled by a single complex-conjugate pair of the
imaginary fixed points of a $\phi^3$ theory. Scaling theories and
renormalization-group theories are developed to account for the phenomena.
Several universality classes with their own hysteresis exponents are found
including a field-like thermal class, a partly thermal class, and a purely
thermal class, designated respectively as Thermal Class I, II, and III. The
first two classes arise from the opposite limits of the scaling forms proposed
and may cross over to each other depending on the temperature sweep rate. They
are both described by a massless model and a purely massive model, both of
which are equivalent and are derived from the $\phi^3$ theory via symmetry.
Thermal Class III characterizes the cooling transitions in the absence of
applied external fields and is described by purely thermal models, which
includes cases in which the order parameters possess different symmetries and
thus exhibiting different universality classes. For the purely thermal models
whose free energies contain odd-symmetry terms, Thermal Class III emerges only
in mean-field level and is identical with Thermal Class II. Fluctuations change
the model into the other two models. Using the extant three- and two-loop
results for the static and dynamic exponents for the Yang-Lee edge singularity,
which falls into the same universality class to the $\phi^3$ theory, we
estimate the thermal hysteresis exponents of the various classes to the same
precisions. Comparisons with numerical results and experiments are briefly
discussed.

these superoperators are written in terms of a bosonic realization of the

finding an analytic solution of the master equation using known Lie-algebraic

decoding neural states from human brain recordings acquired in a naturalistic

and then annotated coherent clusters using speech and movement labels extracted
automatically from audio and video recordings. To our knowledge, this
represents the first time techniques from computer vision and speech processing
have been used for natural ECoG decoding. Our results show that our
unsupervised approach can discover distinct behaviors from ECoG data, including
moving, speaking and resting. We verify the accuracy of our approach by
comparing to manual annotations. Projecting the discovered cluster centers back
onto the brain, this technique opens the door to automated functional brain
mapping in natural settings.

polynomial time algorithm when k = (log n)^{2+eta} for any eta > 0.
  Our work also shows that the non-homogeneous generalization of the problem --
which we call k-VectorSum -- is W[1]-hard on instances where the number of
equations is O(k log n), improving on previous reductions which produced
Omega(n) equations. We also show that for any constant eps > 0, given a system
of O(exp(O(k))log n) linear equations, it is W[1]-hard to decide if there is a
k-sparse linear form satisfying all the equations or if every function on at
most k-variables (k-junta) satisfies at most (1/2 + eps)-fraction of the
equations. In the setting of computational learning, this shows hardness of
approximate non-proper learning of k-parities. In a similar vein, we use the
hardness of k-EvenSet to show that that for any constant d, unless k-Clique can
be solved in n^{o(k)} time there is no poly(m, n)2^{o(sqrt{k}) time algorithm
to decide whether a given set of m points in F_2^n satisfies: (i) there exists
a non-trivial k-sparse homogeneous linear form evaluating to 0 on all the

variables evaluates to zero on approx. Pr_{F_2^n}[P(z) = 0] fraction of the

and manifold learning in particular, where geometry is to be constructed from
data alone. A significant practical limitation of the current density
estimation literature is that methods have not been developed for manifolds
with boundary, except in simple cases of linear manifolds where the location of
the boundary is assumed to be known. We overcome this limitation by developing
a density estimation method for manifolds with boundary that does not require
any prior knowledge of the location of the boundary. To accomplish this we
introduce statistics that provably estimate the distance and direction of the
boundary, which allows us to apply a cut-and-normalize boundary correction. By
combining multiple cut-and-normalize estimators we introduce a consistent
kernel density estimator that has uniform bias, at interior and boundary
points, on manifolds with boundary.

interest in bioinformatics. While these two approaches have been developed for
different purposes, we describe how some gene set analysis methods can be used
to conduct feature selection. Here we adapt the gene set analysis method,
significance analysis of microarray gene set reduction (SAMGSR), for feature
selection, and propose two extensions-simple SAMGSR and two-level SAMGSR to
identify relevant features for longitudinal microarray data.
  Results and Discussion: When applied to a real-world application, both simple
and two-level SAMGSR work comparably well. Using simulated data, we further
demonstrate that both SAMGSR extensions have the ability to identify the true
relevant genes. If the relevant genes are not highly correlated with the
irrelevant ones, the final models given by the two SAMGSR extensions are
parsimonious as well.
  Conclusions: By adapting SAMGSR for feature selection and applying the
proposed algorithms on a longitudinal gene expression dataset, we demonstrate
that a gene set analysis method can be used for the purpose of feature
selection. We believe this work paves the way for more research to bridge
feature selection and gene set analysis with the development of novel
algorithms.

widely employed to extract the nuclear effective interactions. The known
nuclear mass is usually extracted from the experimental atomic mass by
subtracting the masses of electrons and adding the binding energy of electrons
in the atom. However, the binding energies of electrons are sometimes neglected
in extracting the known nuclear masses. The influence of binding energies of
electrons on nuclear mass predictions are carefully investigated in this work.
If the binding energies of electrons are directly subtracted from the
theoretical mass predictions, the rms deviations of nuclear mass predictions
with respect to the known data are increased by about $200$ keV for nuclei with
$Z, N\geqslant 8$. Furthermore, by using the Coulomb energies between protons
to absorb the binding energies of electrons, their influence on the rms
deviations is significantly reduced to only about $10$ keV for nuclei with $Z,
N\geqslant 8$. However, the binding energies of electrons are still important
for the heavy nuclei, about $150$ keV for nuclei around $Z=100$ and up to about
$500$ keV for nuclei around $Z=120$. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the
binding energies of electrons to reliably predict the masses of heavy nuclei at
an accuracy of hundreds of keV.

deep architecture to match two sentences with multiple positional sentence
representations. Specifically, each positional sentence representation is a
sentence representation at this position, generated by a bidirectional long
short term memory (Bi-LSTM). The matching score is finally produced by
aggregating interactions between these different positional sentence
representations, through $k$-Max pooling and a multi-layer perceptron. Our
model has several advantages: (1) By using Bi-LSTM, rich context of the whole
sentence is leveraged to capture the contextualized local information in each
positional sentence representation; (2) By matching with multiple positional
sentence representations, it is flexible to aggregate different important
contextualized local information in a sentence to support the matching; (3)
Experiments on different tasks such as question answering and sentence

structure. However, its multifrequency profiles cannot simply be fitted with
two Gaussian functions, and a third component is always needed to fit the
bridge region (between two peaks). This would introduce additional, redundant
parameters. In this paper, through a comparison of five fitting functions
(Gaussian, von Mises, hyperbolic secant, square hyperbolic secant, and
Lorentz), it is found that the square hyperbolic secant function can best
reproduce the profile, yielding an improved fit. Moreover, a symmetric 2D
radiation beam function, instead of a simple 1D Gaussian function, is used to
fit the profile. Each profile with either well-resolved or not-so-well-resolved
peaks could be fitted adequately using this beam function, and the bridge
emission between the two peaks does not need to be a new component. Adopting
inclination and impact angles based on polarization measurements, the opening
angle ({\theta}_{\mu}0) of the radiation beam in a certain frequency band is
derived from beam-function fitting. The corresponding radiation altitudes are
then calculated. Based on multi-frequency profiles, we also computed the
Lorentz factors of the particles and their dispersion at those locations in
both the curvature-radiation (CR) and inverse-Compton-scattering (ICS) models.
We found that the Lorentz factors of the particles decrease rapidly as the
radiation altitude increases. Besides, the radiation prefers to be generated in
annular region rather than core region, and this needs further validation.

allows us to describe complex syntax constructs without action code. Since open
grammars are declarative and free from a host programming language of parsers,
software engineering tools and other parser applications can reuse once-defined
grammars across programming languages.
  A key challenge to achieve practical open grammars is the expressiveness of
syntax constructs and the resulting parser performance, as the traditional
action code approach has provided very pragmatic solutions to these two issues.
In Nez, we extend the symbol-based state management to recognize
context-sensitive language syntax, which often appears in major programming
languages. In addition, the Abstract Syntax Tree constructor allows us to make
flexible tree structures, including the left-associative pair of trees. Due to
these extensions, we have demonstrated that Nez can parse not all but many
grammars.
  Nez can generate various types of parsers since all Nez operations are
independent of a specific parser language. To highlight this feature, we have
implemented Nez with dynamic parsing, which allows users to integrate a Nez
parser as a parser library that loads a grammar at runtime. To achieve its
practical performance, Nez operators are assembled into low-level virtual
machine instructions, including automated state modifications when
backtracking, transactional controls of AST construction, and efficient
memoization in packrat parsing. We demonstrate that Nez dynamic parsers achieve
very competitive performance compared to existing efficient parser generators.

arose that older pages have an inherent --- and potentially unfair ---
advantage over emerging pages of high quality, because they have had more time
to acquire hyperlink citations. Algorithms were then proposed to compensate for
this effect. Curiously, in bibliometry, the opposite concern has often been
raised: that a growing body of recent papers crowds out older papers, resulting
in a collective amnesia in research communities, which potentially leads to
reinventions, redundancies, and missed opportunities to connect ideas. A recent
paper by Verstak et al. reported experiments on Google Scholar data, which
seemed to refute the amnesia, or aging, hypothesis. They claimed that more
recently written papers have a larger fraction of outbound citations targeting
papers that are older by a fixed number of years, indicating that ancient
papers are alive and well-loved and increasingly easily found, thanks in part
to Google Scholar. In this paper we show that the full picture is considerably
more nuanced. Specifically, the fate of a fixed sample of papers, as they age,
is rather different from what Verstak et al.'s study suggests: there is clear
and steady abandonment in favor of citations to newer papers. The two
apparently contradictory views are reconciled by the realization that, as time
passes, the number of papers older than a fixed number of years grows rapidly.

sub-parsec Keplerian disk around the nucleus, implying an enclosed mass of 4.55
$\pm$ 0.40 $\times~10^{7}M_\odot$. Meanwhile, from single dish monitoring of
the maser spectra over two years, we measured the secular drifts of maser
features near the systemic velocity of the galaxy with rates between 0.5 and
1.2 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$. Fitting a warped, thin disk model to these
measurements, we determine a Hubble Constant $H_{0}$ of 66.0 $\pm$ 6.0 km

of a spiral density wave associated with the accretion disk. For the
red-shifted features, the envelope defined by the peak maser intensities

oxides and voids. In this paper, we compare the thermal conductance (G) of
Al/trG/Cu interfaces with that of Al/grG/Cu interfaces to understand heat
transfer across metal contacts on transferred graphene. Our samples are
polycrystalline graphene grown on Cu foils by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
and CVD-grown graphene transferred to evaporated Cu thin films. We find that
for the Al/grG/Cu interfaces of as-grown CVD graphene, G=31 MW m^{-2} K^{-1} at
room temperature, two orders of magnitude lower than that of Al/Cu interfaces.
For most as-transferred graphene on Cu films, G=20 MW m^{-2} K^{-1}, 35% lower
than that of as-grown CVD graphene. We carefully rule out the contributions of
residues, native oxides and interfaces roughness, and attribute the difference
in the thermal conductance of as-grown and as-transferred CVD graphene to
different degrees of conformity of graphene to the Cu substrates. We find that
a contact area of 50% only reduces the thermal conductance by 35%, suggesting
that a small amount of heat transfer occurs across voids at graphene
interfaces. We successfully improve the conformity of the as-transferred
graphene to the substrates by annealing the samples at 300{\deg}C, and thus
enhance the thermal conductance of the transferred graphene to the intrinsic
value. From the temperature dependence measurements of G of Al/trG/Cu and
Al/grG/Cu interfaces, we also confirm that phonons are the dominant heat

for channels specified by the number of protons and neutrons included in

Nevertheless, the harvested energy is still limited so it's not able to support

the diversity of the data process including sampling, transmitting and

based on the historical information of the energy harvesting and the VoI of the
processed data. With this scheme, each sensor node need only estimate the
ambient natural energy in short term so as to reduce the computation and the
storage for the historical information. It also can distributively adjust its
own duty cycle according to its local historical information. This paper also
conducts the extensive analysis on the performance of our scheme ODC, and the

natural strengthening of the mean-payoff measure. We allow objectives defined
as Boolean combinations of heterogeneous constraints. While multidimensional
games with Boolean combinations of mean-payoff constraints are undecidable, we
show that the problem becomes EXPTIME-complete for DNF/CNF Boolean combinations
of heterogeneous measures taken among {WMP, Inf, Sup, LimInf, LimSup} and that
exponential memory strategies are sufficient for both players to win. We
provide a detailed study of the complexity and the memory requirements when the
Boolean combination of the measures is replaced by an intersection.
EXPTIME-completeness and exponential memory strategies still hold for the
intersection of measures in {WMP, Inf, Sup, LimInf, LimSup}, and we get
PSPACE-completeness when WMP measure is no longer considered. To avoid
EXPTIME-or PSPACE-hardness, we impose at most one occurrence of WMP measure and
fix the number of Sup measures, and we propose several refinements (on the

spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in systems including two basic competing
ingredients: the self-focusing cubic nonlinearity and a double-well-potential
(DWP) structure. Such systems find diverse physical realizations, chiefly in
optical waveguides, made of a nonlinear material and featuring a transverse DWP
structure, and in models of atomic BEC with attractive inter-atomic
interactions, loaded into a pair of symmetric potential wells coupled by
tunneling across the separating barrier. With the increase of the nonlinearity
strength, the SSB occurs at a critical value of the strength. The first part of
the paper offers a brief overview of the topic. The second part presents a
model which is designed as the simplest one capable to produce the SSB
phenomenology in the one-dimensional geometry. The model is based on the DWP
built as an infinitely deep potential box, which is split into two wells by a
delta-functional barrier at the central point. Approximate analytical
predictions for the SSB are produced for two limit cases: strong (deep) or weak
(shallow) splitting of the potential box by the central barrier. Critical
values of the strength of the nonlinearity at the SSB point, represented by the
norm of the stationary wave field, are found in both cases (the critical
strength is small in the former case, and large in the latter one). For the
intermediate case, a less accurate variational approximation (VA) is developed.

the resource theory of coherence free states are diagonal in some fixed basis,
and free operations are those which cannot create coherence for some particular
experimental realization. Recently, some problems of this approach have been
discussed, and new sets of operations have been proposed to resolve these
problems. We propose here the framework of genuine quantum coherence. This
approach is based on a simple principle: we demand that a genuinely incoherent
operation preserves all incoherent states. This framework captures coherence
under additional constrains such as energy preservation and all genuinely
incoherent operations are incoherent regardless of their particular
experimental realization. We also introduce the full class of operations with
this property, which we call fully incoherent. We analyze in detail the
mathematical structure of these classes and also study possible state
transformations. We show that deterministic manipulation is severely limited,
even in the asymptotic settings. In particular, this framework does not have a
unique golden unit, i.e., there is no single state from which all other states
can be created deterministically with the free operations. This suggests that
any reasonably powerful resource theory of coherence must contain free
operations which can potentially create coherence in some experimental
realization.

determined by means of a standard 4-probe DC measurement technique. In coated
conductors, however, one often encounters problems due to weak or no
stabilization and in such case, when the risk of burning the tape is high, the
4-probe approach can fail. In other cases such as in HTS cable structures,
besides vulnerability and high risk of damage, it may also be difficult to
achieve a high critical current level with a power supply that is normally used
to characterize single strands. We therefore investigated an alternative method
to determine the DC I-V curve, based on measuring the AC transport loss as a
function of frequency in overcritical current range. In the AC regime, both the
hysteretic loss component and the joule dissipation are present for applied
transport currents exceeding the critical current Ic. In this work, AC loss
measurements at different frequencies are related to different electric fields
in DC and a curve similar to the DC I-V is obtained. From this curve, the power
index N and Ic values are estimated. AC regime operation can be more beneficial
for two reasons: firstly, because very high currents can be achieved easily by
using a transformer; secondly, because the effective joule heat dissipation
with overcritical AC currents is much lower than that with DC of the same
amplitudes. In the experiment, we used a 4 mm wide YBCO reference tape with 20
{\mu}m of Cu-stabilization. For the comparison with AC transport loss, the
sample was measured with the standard 4-probe technique and remained stable
even in overload condition. To support our study, numerical simulations,
reproducing both transient and stationary operation conditions, were performed.
A similar relation between the AC current transport loss and the I-V curves was
also observed in the simulations.

  Filter Perspective",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tag population estimation has recently attracted significant research
attention due to its paramount importance on a variety of radio frequency
identification (RFID) applications. However, most, if not all, of existing
estimation mechanisms are proposed for the static case where tag population
remains constant during the estimation process, thus leaving the more
challenging dynamic case unaddressed, despite the fundamental importance of the
latter case on both theoretical analysis and practical application. In order to
bridge this gap, %based on \textit{dynamic framed-slotted ALOHA} (DFSA)
protocol, we devote this paper to designing a generic framework of stable and
accurate tag population estimation schemes based on Kalman filter for both
static and dynamic RFID systems. %The objective is to devise estimation schemes
and analyze the boundedness of estimation error. Technically, we first model
the dynamics of RFID systems as discrete stochastic processes and leverage the
techniques in extended Kalman filter (EKF) and cumulative sum control chart
(CUSUM) to estimate tag population for both static and dynamic systems. By
employing Lyapunov drift analysis, we mathematically characterise the
performance of the proposed framework in terms of estimation accuracy and
convergence speed by deriving the closed-form conditions on the design
parameters under which our scheme can stabilise around the real population size
with bounded relative estimation error that tends to zero with exponential
convergence rate.

that the far-infrared flux, where the disc becomes optically thin, is
correlated with the millimetre flux, which provides a measure of the total dust
mass. The ratio of far-infrared to sub-millimetre flux is found to be greater
for targets with discs that are brighter at millimetre wavelengths and that
have steeper sub-millimetre slopes. Furthermore, discs with flared geometry
have, on average, larger excesses than flat geometry discs. Finally, we

by the gluon propagator and examine the necessary conditions for obtaining
finite solutions within the infrared region. The role of seagull diagrams
receives particular attention, as do the identities that enforce the
cancellation of all potential quadratic divergences. We stress the necessity of
introducing nonperturbative massless poles in the fully dressed vertices of the
theory in order to trigger the Schwinger mechanism, and explain in detail the
instrumental role of these poles in maintaining the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin
symmetry at every step of the mass-generating procedure. The dynamical equation
governing the evolution of the gluon mass is derived, and its solutions are
determined numerically following implementation of a set of simplifying
assumptions. The obtained mass function is positive definite, and exhibits a
power law running that is consistent with general arguments based on the
operator product expansion in the ultraviolet region. A possible connection
between confinement and the presence of an inflection point in the gluon

subject to a uniform bias force such as gravity. An atomic wave packet in a

dynamical backaction-induced sideband damping/amplification of the

detuning, atoms are transported either with or against the bias force
accompanied by an up- or down-conversion of the frequency of the pump laser

for models of a Sun-like star, HD 52265, and a subgiant star, KIC 7341231. We
randomly perturbed the parameters of the stellar models within the
uncertainties of the spectroscopic and asteroseismic constraints and used these
perturbed stellar models to compute rotational splittings. We experimented with
three rotation profiles: solid body rotation, a step function, and a smooth
rotation profile decreasing with radius. We then solved the inverse problem to
infer the radial differential rotation profile using a RLS inversion and
kernels from the best-fit stellar model.We found that the inversions for
Sun-like stars with solar-like radial differential rotation profiles are
insensitive to the uncertainties in the stellar models. We found that when the
rotation rate below the convection zone is increased to six times that of the
surface rotation rate the inferred rotation profile excluded solid body
rotation. With the current observational uncertainties, we found that
inversions of subgiant stars are sensitive to the uncertainties in the stellar
model. Our findings suggest that inversions for the radial differential
rotation of subgiant stars would benefit from more tightly constrained stellar
models. In Sun-like stars, the insensitivity of the inversions to stellar model
uncertainties suggests that it may be possible to perform ensemble inversions
for the average radial differential rotation of many stars with a range of
stellar types to better constrain the inversions.

many one-dimensional (1d) nonequilibrium systems. Here we extend this
conjecture to general d-dimensional driven diffusive systems, and validate its
predictions against both numerical simulations of rare events and microscopic
exact calculations of three paradigmatic models of diffusive transport in d=2.
Crucially, the existence of a structured current vector field at the
fluctuating level, coupled to the local mobility, turns out to be essential to
understand current statistics in d>1. We prove that, when compared to the
straightforward extension of the AP to high-d, the so-called weak AP always
yields a better minimizer of the macroscopic fluctuation theory action for
current statistics.

equations select particular solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. In order
to gain some physical insight from the quantization of these cosmological

quantum theory. The generic result is that, in all but one model, one can find
appropriate ranges of the parameters, so that the emerging semiclassical

phylogenetic networks. Such structures generalize the standard phylogenetic
tree model by also allowing cycles and have been introduced in rooted and
unrooted form. In contrast to phylogenetic trees, however, surprisingly little
is known about the interplay between both types thus hampering our ability to
make much needed progress for rooted phylogenetic networks by drawing on
insights from their much better understood unrooted counterparts. Unrooted
phylogenetic networks are underpinned by split systems and by focusing on them
we establish a first link between both types. More precisely, we develop a link
between 1-nested phylogenetic networks which are examples of rooted
phylogenetic networks and the well-studied median networks (aka Buneman graph)
which are examples of unrooted phylogenetic networks. In particular, we show
that not only can a 1-nested network be obtained from a median network but also
that that network is, in a well-defined sense, optimal. Along the way, we
characterize circular split systems in terms of the novel $\mathcal

plenitude of applications related to propagation of electromagnetic waves in
anisotropic media. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed using a coordinate
transformation and a piecewise function for the purpose of designing a three
dimensional cloak having an arbitrary geometry which could be convex or
non-convex in nature. The surfaces of the cloak as well as of the body under
consideration are assumed to be conformal to each other. For an arbitrary
geometry, the coordinate system needed to model the surface can be a
non-orthogonal system. For the purpose of verification of the algorithm, a ray
tracing process is carried out for an ellipsoid as well as for a concave
surface having axial symmetry. In order to solve the Hamiltonian equation for
the purpose of ray tracing, the process of finding the derivatives
analytically, for an arbitrary geometry as considered here, becomes very
cumbersome. Here, a numerical method is described which provides a better
approximation to the partial derivatives than the conventional finite
difference approach based on forward differences.

nonclassical effects may influence the dynamics of plasmon resonances as the
plasmon confinement is approaching the few--nanometer scale. However, an
unambiguous approach to quantify the degree of nonclassical dynamics remains.
We propose a nonclassical-impact parameter (NCI) to characterize the degree of
nonclassical effects from an energy perspective, i.e. which fraction of the
total electromagnetic energy is attributed to classical electrodynamic terms
and which fraction is correspondingly to be assigned to nonclassical degrees of
freedom? We show that the NCI relates directly to two fundamental parameters of
plasmon resonances: the loss function and the quality factor. Guided by the
NCI, we discuss the nonclassical effects of plasmon waveguiding modes of
metallic slab waveguides, and highlight the general features of the
nonclassical effects at different microscopic levels by contrasting the
numerical results from the semi-classical hydrodynamic Drude model (HDM) and
the microscopic random-phase approximation (RPA). The formal relation between
the HDM and the RPA is also established for metals by exploring the limit of an

trials where there is right censoring that may depend on treatment and baseline
variables. The proposed estimator leverages prognostic baseline variables to
obtain equal or better asymptotic precision compared to traditional estimators.
Under regularity conditions and random censoring within strata of treatment and
baseline variables, the proposed estimator has the following features: (i) it
is interpretable under violations of the proportional hazards assumption; (ii)
it is consistent and at least as precise as the Kaplan-Meier estimator under
independent censoring; (iii) it remains consistent under violations of
independent censoring (unlike the Kaplan-Meier estimator) when either the
censoring or survival distributions are estimated consistently; and (iv) it
achieves the nonparametric efficiency bound when both of these distributions
are consistently estimated. We illustrate the performance of our method using
simulations based on resampling data from a completed, phase 3 randomized
clinical trial of a new surgical treatment for stroke; the proposed estimator
achieves a 12% gain in relative efficiency compared to the Kaplan-Meier
estimator. The proposed estimator has potential advantages over existing
approaches for randomized trials with time-to-event outcomes, since existing
methods either rely on model assumptions that are untenable in many
applications, or lack some of the efficiency and consistency properties
(i)-(iv). We focus on estimation of the restricted mean survival time, but our
methods may be adapted to estimate any treatment effect measure defined as a
smooth contrast between the survival curves for each study arm. We provide R

problem with $d$ decisions, gains and losses to be respectively maximized or

sparsity assumption (at each stage, at most $s$ decisions incur a nonzero
outcome), we derive optimal regret bounds of different orders. Specifically,
with gains, we obtain an optimal regret guarantee after $T$ stages of order
$\sqrt{T\log s}$, so the classical dependency in the dimension is replaced by
the sparsity size. With losses, we provide matching upper and lower bounds of
order $\sqrt{Ts\log(d)/d}$, which is decreasing in $d$. Eventually, we also

and Lapata, 2010) is a widely used method for computing meanings of phrases,
which takes the average of vector representations of the constituent words. In
this article, we prove an upper bound for the bias of additive composition,
which is the first theoretical analysis on compositional frameworks from a
machine learning point of view. The bound is written in terms of collocation
strength; we prove that the more exclusively two successive words tend to occur
together, the more accurate one can guarantee their additive composition as an
approximation to the natural phrase vector. Our proof relies on properties of
natural language data that are empirically verified, and can be theoretically
derived from an assumption that the data is generated from a Hierarchical
Pitman-Yor Process. The theory endorses additive composition as a reasonable
operation for calculating meanings of phrases, and suggests ways to improve
additive compositionality, including: transforming entries of distributional
word vectors by a function that meets a specific condition, constructing a
novel type of vector representations to make additive composition sensitive to
word order, and utilizing singular value decomposition to train word vectors.

Real-Time Bidding (RTB) algorithms respond to many auctions -- usually Vickrey

maximizing one or several key performance indicators (KPI). The optimization
problems faced by companies building bidding strategies are new and interesting
for the community of applied mathematicians. In this article, we introduce a
stochastic optimal control model that addresses the question of the optimal

inventory bought with a given amount of cash in the framework of audience
strategies, the maximization of the number of conversions/acquisitions with a
given amount of cash, etc. In our model, the sequence of auctions is modeled by
a Poisson process and the \textit{price to beat} for each auction is modeled by
a random variable following almost any probability distribution. We show that
the optimal bids are characterized by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and
that almost-closed form solutions can be found by using a fluid limit.
Numerical examples are also carried out.

which reflect the subtopic structure of the text. It is beneficial to many
natural language processing tasks, such as Information Retrieval (IR) and
document summarisation. Current approaches to text segmentation are similar in
that they all use word-frequency metrics to measure the similarity between two
regions of text, so that a document is segmented based on the lexical cohesion
between its words. Various NLP tasks are now moving towards the semantic web
and ontologies, such as ontology-based IR systems, to capture the
conceptualizations associated with user needs and contents. Text segmentation
based on lexical cohesion between words is hence not sufficient anymore for
such tasks. This paper proposes OntoSeg, a novel approach to text segmentation
based on the ontological similarity between text blocks. The proposed method
uses ontological similarity to explore conceptual relations between text
segments and a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm to
represent the text as a tree-like hierarchy that is conceptually structured.
The rich structure of the created tree further allows the segmentation of text
in a linear fashion at various levels of granularity. The proposed method was
evaluated on a wellknown dataset, and the results show that using ontological
similarity in text segmentation is very promising. Also we enhance the proposed
method by combining ontological similarity with lexical similarity and the
results show an enhancement of the segmentation quality.

relational data, realized by linking data sources to an ontology by means of
declarative mappings. DL-Lite_R, which is the logic underpinning the W3C
ontology language OWL 2 QL and the current language of choice for OBDA, has
been designed with the goal of delegating query answering to the underlying
database engine, and thus is restricted in expressive power. E.g., it does not
allow one to express disjunctive information, and any form of recursion on the
data. The aim of this paper is to overcome these limitations of DL-Lite_R, and
extend OBDA to more expressive ontology languages, while still leveraging the
underlying relational technology for query answering. We achieve this by
relying on two well-known mechanisms, namely conservative rewriting and
approximation, but significantly extend their practical impact by bringing into
the picture the mapping, an essential component of OBDA. Specifically, we
develop techniques to rewrite OBDA specifications with an expressive ontology
to ""equivalent"" ones with a DL-Lite_R ontology, if possible, and to approximate
them otherwise. We do so by exploiting the high expressive power of the mapping
layer to capture part of the domain semantics of rich ontology languages. We
have implemented our techniques in the prototype system OntoProx, making use of
the state-of-the-art OBDA system Ontop and the query answering system Clipper,
and we have shown their feasibility and effectiveness with experiments on
synthetic and real-world data.

quantum computers since its security is based on an NP-complete problem, namely

the sentence set reaching the upper bound of ROUGE. Since we allow summary
sentences to be selected from both documents and high-quality tweets, the
generated reference summaries could be abstractive. Both informativeness and

therefore characterized the pulse shape and light yield of alpha induced TPB

polarized spectra of 560 O and B stars were collected with the instruments
ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, Narval at the T\'elescope
Bernard Lyot, and HARPSpol at the European Southern Observatory La Silla 3.6m

the general results of the survey, we introduce the scientific motivation and
goals, describe the sample of targets, review the instrumentation and
observational techniques used, explain the exposure time calculation designed
to provide sensitivity to surface dipole fields above approximately 100 G,
discuss the polarimetric performance, stability and uncertainty of the
instrumentation, and summarize the previous and forthcoming publications.

order have recently inspired a quest for similar effects in classical wave
phenomena. Acoustic topological insulators, in particular, hold the promise to
revolutionize our ability to control sound, allowing for large isolation in the
bulk and broadband one-way transport on their edges, with topological immunity
against structural defects and disorder. So far these fascinating properties
have been obtained relying on moving media, which inherently introduce noise
and absorption losses, hindering the practical applicability of topological
acoustics. Here, we overcome these limitations by modulating in time the
acoustic properties of a lattice of resonators, introducing the concept of
acoustic Floquet topological insulators. Acoustic modulation at ultrasonic
frequencies can reach values as high as a few percents, enabling broadband
effects with an on-site, moderate modulation strategy that surprisingly does
not require phase uniformity across the lattice. Using first-principle
numerical experiments, we show that acoustic waves provide a fertile ground to
apply the anomalous physics of Floquet topological insulators, and demonstrate
their relevance for a wide range of acoustic applications, including broadband
acoustic isolation and topologically protected, nonreciprocal acoustic
emitters.

quantization. First an exact expression of failure probability from field

proportional to operation number and the amplitude of $|1\rangle_x |0\rangle_y$

number of photons and amplitude of $|0\rangle_x |0\rangle_y$ or $|0\rangle_x

When the initial state is $|1\rangle_x |0\rangle_y$ or $|1\rangle_x
|1\rangle_y$, after about $10^2$ times of CNOT operations, failure probability
is no less than $10^{-2}$, while $10^{-2}$ is the known maximum threshold in

can help to determine the number of CNOT operations between coding and decoding

structures show promise for extraordinary light manipulation; they have yielded
novel ultrathin optical components such as flat lenses, wave plates,
holographic surfaces and orbital angular momentum manipulation and detection
over a broad range of electromagnetic spectrum. However the optical properties
of metasurfaces developed to date do not allow for versatile tunability of
reflected or transmitted wave amplitude and phase after fabrication, thus
limiting their use in a wide range of applications. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate a gate-tunable metasurface that enables dynamic electrical control
of the phase and amplitude of the plane wave reflected from the metasurface.
Tunability arises from field-effect modulation of the complex refractive index
of conducting oxide layers incorporated into metasurface antenna elements which
are configured in a reflectarray geometry. We measure a phase shift of {\pi}
and ~ 30% change in the reflectance by applying 2.5 V gate bias. Additionally,
we demonstrate modulation at frequencies exceeding 10 MHz, and electrical
switching of +/-1 order diffracted beams by electrical control over subgroups
of metasurface elements, a basic requirement for electrically tunable
beam-steering phased array metasurfaces. The proposed tunable metasurface
design with high optical quality and high speed dynamic phase modulation
suggests applications in next generation ultrathin optical components for
imaging and sensing technologies, such as reconfigurable beam steering devices,
dynamic holograms, tunable ultrathin lens, nano-projectors, and nanoscale

propose a {\em network-of-networks} approach for modeling power transmission

model distinguishes between different components of the network that operate at
different voltage ratings, and also captures the intra and inter-network
connectivity patterns. By building the graph in this fashion we present a

Consequently, this novel approach will have a significant impact on the

Lagrangian, the regularity that the left- and right-handed axial-vector photons
refer to long- and short-lived bosons of true neutrality, respectively. Such a
difference in lifetimes expresses the unidenticality of masses, energies, and
momenta of axial-vector photons of the different components. They require the
generalization of the classical Klein-Gordon equation to the case of C-odd
types of particles with a nonzero spin. Together with a new Dirac equation for
truly neutral particles with the half-integral spin, the latter reflects the
availability in nature of the second type of the local axial-vector gauge
transformation responsible for origination in a Lagrangian of C-oddity of an
interaction Newton component, which gives an axial-vector mass to all the
interacting particles and fields. The quantum axial-vector mass, energy, and
momentum operators constitute herewith the CP-invariant Schr\""odinger equation,
confirming that each of them can individually influence on the matter field.
Thereby, findings define at the new level, namely, at the level of the
mass-charge structure of gauge invariance the mirror Euler-Lagrange equation
such that it has an axial-vector nature.

thin ferrofluid (FF) layers were experimentally investigated. It was observed
that, under an influence of an external uniform magnetic field, pulses applied
to the samples surfaces in normal direction decrease the optical transmission
with further returning it to its original state, even before the end of the
field pulse. The dependencies of the observed effects on the magnetic pulse
magnitude and the samples thickness were investigated. The experimental results
are explained using FF columnar aggregates growth and lateral coalescence under
influence of a magnetic field, leading to a light scattering type
Rayleigh-to-Mie transition. Further evolution of this process comes to a
geometrical optics scale and respective macroscopic observable opaque FF
columnar aggregates emergence. These changes of optical transmission are
non-monotonic during the magnetic field pulse duration with minimal value in
the case of Mie scattering, which is known as a magneto-optical extinction
trend inversion. The residual inversion was detected after the external
magnetic field pulse falling edge. Using molecular dynamics simulation, we
showed that a homogeneous external magnetic field is enough for the formation
of columnar aggregates and their fusion. The results clarify the known Li
theory (Li et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 37 (2004) 3357, and Sci. Technol.
Adv. Mate. 8 (2007) 448), implying an inhomogeneous field as a required
prerequisite for the magneto-optical extinction trend inversion phenomenon.
