are able to determine the temperature dependent solvation free energies for
those selected light gases in simulated imidazolium based ILs with high
statistical accuracy. Our simulations show that the magnitude of the solvation
free energy of a gas molecule at a chosen reference temperature and its
temperature-derivatives are intimately related with respect to oneanother. We
conclude that this ""universal"" behavior is rooted in a solvation
entropy-enthalpy compensation effect, which seems to be a defining feature of
the solvation of small molecules in Ionic Liquids. We argue that this feature
is based on a hypothesized funnel-like shape of the free energy landscape of a
solvated gas molecule. The observations lead to simple analytical relations,
determining the temperature dependence of the solubility data based on the
absolute solubility at a certain reference temperature, which we call
""solvation funnel"" model. By comparing our results with available experimental
data from many sources, we can show that the ""solvation funnel"" model is
particularly helpful for providing reliable estimates for the solvation
behavior of very light gases, such as hydrogen, where conflicting experimental

program in both the Archimedean and $p$-adic situations. Indeed, the study of
conformal field theory and its connections with probability provides a golden
opportunity where $p$-adic analysis can lead the way towards a better
understanding of open problems in the Archimedean setting. Finally, we present
a summary of progress made on a $p$-adic hierarchical model and point out

objects are not yet understood. To probe it, we present multi-epoch LBT-LUCIFER
spectroscopic observations of the Pa{\delta}, Pa{\beta}, and Br{\gamma} lines
observed in the Herbig star VVSer, along with VLTI-AMBER Br{\gamma}
spectro-interferometric observations at medium resolution. Our spectroscopic
observations show line profile variability in all the HI lines. The strongest
variability is observed in the redshifted part of the line profiles. The
Br{\gamma} spectro-interferometric observations indicate that the Br{\gamma}
line emitting region is smaller than the continuum emitting region. To
interpret our results, we employed radiative transfer models with three
different flow configurations: magnetospheric accretion, a
magneto-centrifugally driven disc wind, and a schematic bipolar outflow. Our
models suggest that the HI line emission in VVSer is dominated by the
contribution of an extended wind, perhaps a bipolar outflow. Although the exact
physical process for producing such outflow is not known, this model is capable
of reproducing the averaged single-peaked line profiles of the HI lines.
Additionally, the observed visibilities, differential and closure phases are
best reproduced when a wind is considered. Nevertheless, the complex line
profiles and variability could be explained by changes in the relative
contribution of the magnetosphere and/or winds to the line emission. This might
indicate that the NIR HI lines are formed in a complex inner disc region where
inflow and outflow components might coexist. Furthermore, the contribution of
each of these mechanisms to the line appears time variable, suggesting a
non-steady accretion/ejection flow.

NGC 2354. ESO489SC01 is not a real cluster, while Haffner~22 is an overlooked
cluster aged about 2.5 Gyr. Conclusions for Ruprecht~11 are preliminary,
evidence for a cluster being marginal. Fields surrounding the clusters show
signatures of young and intermediate-age stellar populations. The young
population background to NGC~2354 and Ruprecht~11 lies 8-9 kpc from the Sun and
$\sim$1 kpc below the formal Galactic plane, tracing a portion of the
Norma-Cygnus arm, challenging Galactic models that adopt a sharp cut-off of the
disk 12-14 kpc from the Galactic center. The old population is metal poor with
an age of 2-3 Gyr, resembling star clusters like Tombaugh 2 or NGC 2158. It has
a large color spread and is difficult to locate precisely. Young and old
populations follow a pattern that depends critically on the vertical location
of the thin and/or thick disk, and whether or not a particular line of sight
intersects one, both, or none.

transitions which sends all states of the automaton to a single state. Research
on this topic has been driven by the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture, one of the oldest
and most famous problems in automata theory, according to which a synchronizing
$n$-state automaton has a reset word of length at most $(n-1)^2$. The
transitions of an automaton generate a transformation monoid on the set of
states, and so an automaton can be regarded as a transformation monoid with a
prescribed set of generators. In this setting, an automaton is synchronizing if
the transitions generate a constant map. A permutation group $G$ on a set
$\Omega$ is said to synchronize a map $f$ if the monoid $\langle G,f\rangle$
generated by $G$ and $f$ is synchronizing in the above sense; we say $G$ is
synchronizing if it synchronizes every non-permutation.
  The classes of synchronizing groups and friends form an hierarchy of natural
and elegant classes of groups lying strictly between the classes of primitive
and $2$-homogeneous groups. These classes have been floating around for some
years and it is now time to provide a unified reference on them. The study of
all these classes has been prompted by the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture, but it is of
independent interest since it involves a rich mix of group theory,
combinatorics, graph endomorphisms, semigroup theory, finite geometry, and
representation theory, and has interesting computational aspects as well. So as
to make the paper self-contained, we have provided background material on these

two closely spaced antiferromagnetic transitions $T_{\text{N1}}=12.0$ K
(kagom\'e planes) and $T_{\text{N2}}=11.4$ K (triangular planes). In the
dilution range tested, the low temperature magnetic state takes three forms:
antiferromagnetic ($0 \leq x \leq 0.05$), ill-defined ($x=0.10$ and 0.15), and
spin glass ($0.30 \leq x \leq 1.0$). The AFM region shows an extreme
vulnerability to dilution with a percolation threshold of $p_{\text{c1}}=0.74
\pm 0.04$ and $p_{\text{c2}}=0.65 \pm 0.05$ for the kagom\'e and triangular
planes respectively, which are much larger than expected for 3D systems. We
suggest that this behavior is possibly due to coupling between the kagom\'e and
triangular spins forming a 'network of networks' (NON). Thermal expansion data
on parent NGO indicates a field dependent lattice contraction during ordering
events. Furthermore, there is a transition from contraction to expansion in an
applied field of 6 T in the kagom\'e planes. For dilution levels $x \geq 0.30$,
the system becomes a spin glass with canonical behavior. Specific heat results
suggest that the triangular spins become disordered with increasing Mg$^{2+}$
substitution followed by the onset of glassiness in the kagom\'e planes.
Furthermore, there appears to be a dilution driven shift from 3 dimensional to
2 dimensional behavior as the low temperature magnetic heat capacity scales as
$T^{2}$ in the spin glass state.

near-infrared observations. We show that the outflow cavity is also detected at
both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths, and in fact dominates the mid-infrared

The position of stars on the H-R diagram is an important indication of their
structure and evolution, and it helps improve stellar models. Furthermore, the
age and mass of stars hosting planets are required elements for studying
exoplanetary systems. We aim at determining accurate parameters of a set of 18
bright exoplanet host and potential host stars from interferometric
measurements, photometry, and stellar models. Using the VEGA/CHARA
interferometer, we measured the angular diameters of 18 stars, ten of which
host exoplanets. We combined them with their distances to estimate their radii.
We used photometry to derive their bolometric flux and, then, their effective
temperature and luminosity to place them on the H-R diagram. We then used the
PARSEC models to derive their best fit ages and masses, with error bars derived
from MC calculations. Our interferometric measurements lead to an average of
1.9% uncertainty on angular diameters and 3% on stellar radii. There is good
agreement between measured and indirect estimations of angular diameters (from
SED fitting or SB relations) for MS stars, but not as good for more evolved
stars. For each star, we provide a likelihood map in the mass-age plane;
typically, two distinct sets of solutions appear (an old and a young age). The
errors on the ages and masses that we provide account for the metallicity
uncertainties, which are often neglected by other works. From measurements of
its radius and density, we also provide the mass of 55 Cnc independently of
models. From the stellar masses, we provide new estimates of semi-major axes
and minimum masses of exoplanets with reliable uncertainties. We also derive
the radius, density, and mass of 55 Cnc e, a super-Earth that transits its
stellar host. Our exoplanetary parameters reflect the known population of
exoplanets.

wide 9.6 square degree field of view 3.2 Gigapixel camera, and rapid
observational cadence, LSST will discover more than 5 million asteroids over
its ten year survey lifetime. With a single visit limiting magnitude of 24.5 in
r-band, LSST will be able to detect asteroids in the Main Belt down to
sub-kilometer sizes. The current strawman for the LSST survey strategy is to
obtain two visits (each visit being a pair of back-to-back 15s exposures) per
field, separated by about 30 minutes, covering the entire visible sky every 3-4
days throughout the observing season, for ten years.
  The catalogs generated by LSST will increase the known number of small bodies
in the Solar System by a factor of 10-100 times, among all populations. The
median number of observations for Main Belt asteroids will be on the order of
200-300, with Near Earth Objects receiving a median of 90 observations. These
observations will be spread among ugrizy bandpasses, providing photometric
colors and allowing sparse lightcurve inversion to determine rotation periods,
spin axes, and shape information.
  These catalogs will be created using automated detection software, the LSST
Moving Object Processing System (MOPS), that will take advantage of the
carefully characterized LSST optical system, cosmetically clean camera, and
recent improvements in difference imaging. Tests with the prototype MOPS
software indicate that linking detections (and thus discovery) will be possible
at LSST depths with our working model for the survey strategy, but evaluation
of MOPS and improvements in the survey strategy will continue. All data
products and software created by LSST will be publicly available.

hadrons is a non-perturbative mechanism that offers important insights into the
nucleon structure. Di-hadron fragmentation functions can be extracted from
semi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation data. They also appear in
observables describing the semi-inclusive production of two hadrons in
deep-inelastic scattering of leptons off nucleons or in hadron-hadron
collisions. When a target nucleon is transversely polarized, a specific
chiral-odd di-hadron fragmentation function can be used as the analyzer of the
net density of transversely polarized quarks in a transversely polarized
nucleon, the so-called transversity distribution. The latter can be extracted
through suitable single-spin asymmetries in the framework of collinear
factorization, thus in a much simpler framework with respect to the traditional
one in single-hadron fragmentation. At subleading twist, the same chiral-odd
di-hadron fragmentation function provides the cleanest access to the poorly
known twist-3 parton distribution $e(x)$, which is intimately related to the
mechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. When sensitive to
details of transverse momentum dynamics of partons, the di-hadron fragmentation
functions for a longitudinally polarized quark can be connected to the
longitudinal jet handedness to explore possible effects due to $CP-$violation
of the QCD vacuum. In this review, we outline the formalism of di-hadron
fragmentation functions, we discuss different observables where they appear and
we present measurements and future worldwide plans.

conditions on the regressor vector are well known. With persistent excitation
of the regressor vector in model reference adaptive control the state error and
the adaptation error are globally exponentially stable, or equivalently,
exponentially stable in the large. When the excitation condition however is
imposed on the reference input or the reference model state it is often
incorrectly concluded that the persistent excitation in those signals also
implies exponential stability in the large. The definition of persistent
excitation is revisited so as to address some possible confusion in the
adaptive control literature. It is then shown that persistent excitation of the
reference model only implies local persistent excitation (weak persistent
excitation). Weak persistent excitation of the regressor is still sufficient
for uniform asymptotic stability in the large, but not exponential stability in
the large. We show that there exists an infinite region in the state-space of
adaptive systems where the state rate is bounded. This infinite region with
finite rate of convergence is shown to exist not only in classic open-loop

that RU Vul is a metal-poor star with a metallicity $[{\rm M}/{\rm

that it is an old, low-mass member of the thick disc or the halo population.
The present day pulsation period determined from our photometry is $\sim108$ d,
the semi-amplitude in the V-band is $0.39\pm0.03$ mag. The observed period

  In this paper, we initiate the study of robust algorithms for partial
recovery in SBM with modeling errors or noise. We consider graphs generated
according to the Stochastic Block Model and then modified by an adversary. We
allow two types of adversarial errors, Feige---Kilian or monotone errors, and
edge outlier errors. Mossel, Neeman and Sly (STOC 2015) posed an open question
about whether an almost exact recovery is possible when the adversary is
allowed to add $o(n)$ edges. Our work answers this question affirmatively even
in the case of $k>2$ communities.
  We then show that our algorithms work not only when the instances come from
SBM, but also work when the instances come from any distribution of graphs that
is $\epsilon m$ close to SBM in the Kullback---Leibler divergence. This result
also works in the presence of adversarial errors. Finally, we present almost
tight lower bounds for two communities.

power-maximizing electronic devices. However, the tribopolymer which forms due
to the mechanical load to the surface contacts affects the conductivity between
the contacts dramatically. This is one of the challenging problems that prevent
widespread practical use of these otherwise promising devices. Here, we use
density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the mechanisms of tribopolymer
formation, including normal mechanical loading, the catalytic effect, as well
as the electrochemical effect of the metal contacts. We select benzene select
as the background gas, because it is one of the most common and severe
hydrocarbon contaminants. Two adsorption cases are considered: one is benzene
on the reactive metal surface, Pt(111), and the other is benzene on the noble
metal, Au(111). We demonstrate that the formation of tribopolymer is induced
both by the mechanical load and by the catalytic effect of the contact. First,
benzene molecules are adsorbed on the Pt surfaces. Then, due to the closure of
the Pt contacts, stress is applied to the adsorbates, making the C-H bonds more
fragile. As the stress increases further, H atoms are pressed close to the Pt
substrate and begin to bond with Pt atoms. Thus Pt acts as a catalyst,
accelerating the dehydrogenation process. When there is voltage applied across
the contacts, the catalytic effect is enhanced by electrochemistry. Finally,
due to the loss of H atoms, C atoms become more reactive and link together or
pile up to form tribopolymer. By understanding these mechanisms, we provide
guidance on design strategies for suppressing tribopolymer formation.

nowadays a recognized fact in the treatment of sampling problems. Indeed,
shift-invariant subspaces of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ and also periodic extensions of
finite signals are remarkable examples where this occurs. As a consequence, the
availability of an abstract unitary sampling theory becomes a useful tool to
handle these problems. In this paper we derive a sampling theory for tensor
products of unitary invariant subspaces. This allows to merge the cases of
finitely/infinitely generated unitary invariant subspaces formerly studied in
the mathematical literature, it also allows to introduce the several variables
case. As the involved samples are identified as frame coefficients in suitable
tensor product spaces, the relevant mathematical technique is that of frame
theory, involving both, finite/infinite dimensional cases.

annotation of images at very large scale is labor-intensive and only little
labeled data is available, particularly at instance level and for street
scenes. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem by lifting the
semantic instance labeling task from 2D into 3D. Given reconstructions from
stereo or laser data, we annotate static 3D scene elements with rough bounding
primitives and develop a model which transfers this information into the image
domain. We leverage our method to obtain 2D labels for a novel suburban video
dataset which we have collected, resulting in 400k semantic and instance image
annotations. A comparison of our method to state-of-the-art label transfer
baselines reveals that 3D information enables more efficient annotation while
at the same time resulting in improved accuracy and time-coherent labels.

  achieving sublinear in scale optimality gap","Final version. 35 pages",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A service system with multiple types of arriving customers is considered.
There is an infinite number of homogeneous servers. Multiple customers can be
placed for simultaneous service into one server, subject to general packing
constraints. Each new arriving customer is placed for service immediately,
either into an occupied server, as long as packing constraints are not
violated, or into an empty server. After service completion, each customer
leaves its server and the system. The basic objective is to minimize the number
of occupied servers in steady state. We study a Greedy-Random (GRAND) placement
(packing) algorithm, introduced in [23]. This is a simple online algorithm,
which places each arriving customer uniformly at random into either one of the
already occupied servers that can still fit the customer, or one of the
so-called zero-servers, which are empty servers designated to be available to
new arrivals. In [23], a version of the algorithm, labeled GRAND($aZ$), was
considered, where the number of zero servers is $aZ$, with $Z$ being the
current total number of customers in the system, and $a>0$ being an algorithm
parameter. GRAND($aZ$) was shown in [23] to be asymptotically optimal in the
following sense: (a) the steady-state optimality gap grows linearly in the
system scale $r$ (the mean total number of customers in service), i.e. as $c(a)
r$ for some $c(a)> 0$; and (b) $c(a) \to 0$ as $a\to 0$. In this paper, we
consider the GRAND($Z^p$) algorithm, in which the number of zero-servers is
$Z^p$, where $p \in (1-1/(8\kappa),1)$ is an algorithm parameter, and
$(\kappa-1)$ is the maximum possible number of customers that a server can fit.
We prove the asymptotic optimality of GRAND($Z^p$) in the sense that the
steady-state optimality gap is $o(r)$, sublinear in the system scale. This is a
stronger form of asymptotic optimality than that of GRAND($aZ$).

powerful shock fronts that originate during cluster mergers, and are a testbed
for the acceleration of relativistic particles in the intracluster medium.
Recently, radio relic observations have pushed into the cm-wavelength domain
(1-30 GHz) where a break from the standard synchrotron power-law spectrum has
been found, most noticeably in the famous 'Sausage' relic. In this paper, we
point to an important effect that has been ignored or considered insignificant
while interpreting these new high-frequency radio data, namely the
contamination due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect that changes the
observed synchrotron flux. Even though the radio relics reside in the cluster
outskirts, the shock-driven pressure boost increases the SZ signal locally by
roughly an order of magnitude. The resulting flux contamination for some
well-known relics are non-negligible already at 10 GHz, and at 30 GHz the
observed synchrotron fluxes can be diminished by a factor of several from their
true values. Interferometric observations are not immune to this contamination,
since the change in the SZ signal occurs roughly at the same length scale as
the synchrotron emission, although there the flux loss is less severe than
single-dish observations. We present a simple analytical approximation for the
synchrotron-to-SZ flux ratio, based on a theoretical radio relic model that
connects the non-thermal emission to the thermal gas properties, and show that
by measuring this ratio one can potentially estimate the relic magnetic fields
or the particle acceleration efficiency.

computer vision applications. Most state-of-the-art supervised hashing
approaches employ batch-learners. Unfortunately, batch-learning strategies can
be inefficient when confronted with large training datasets. Moreover, with
batch-learners, it is unclear how to adapt the hash functions as a dataset
continues to grow and diversify over time. Yet, in many practical scenarios the
dataset grows and diversifies; thus, both the hash functions and the indexing
must swiftly accommodate these changes. To address these issues, we propose an
online hashing method that is amenable to changes and expansions of the

complexity with the dataset size. Our solution is supervised, in that we
incorporate available label information to preserve the semantic neighborhood.
Such an adaptive hashing method is attractive; but it requires recomputing the
hash table as the hash functions are updated. If the frequency of update is
high, then recomputing the hash table entries may cause inefficiencies in the
system, especially for large indexes. Thus, we also propose a framework to
reduce hash table updates. We compare our method to state-of-the-art solutions

provides a panoramic view of the stellar population characteristics of

ellipticals (cEs) depart from the mass-metallicity relation of massive
early-type galaxies, which forms a continuous sequence with dwarf galaxies. At
lower mass, the metallicity distribution of ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) changes
at a few times $10^7$ M$_{\odot}$, which roughly coincides with the mass where
luminosity function arguments previously suggested the GC population ends. The
highest metallicities in CSSs are paralleled only by those of dwarf galaxy
nuclei and the central parts of massive early types. These findings can be
interpreted as CSSs previously being more massive and undergoing tidal
interactions to obtain their current mass and compact size. Such an
interpretation is supported by CSSs with direct evidence for tidal stripping,
and by an examination of the CSS internal escape velocities.

accretion and feedback are present, and use these models to investigate how
star cluster formation might terminate. Protostellar outflows are the strongest
form of feedback in low-mass regions, but these cannot stop cluster formation

evaporation, while accounting for the important effect of dust opacity on
photo-ionization. Our models are consistent with the census of protostellar
outflows in NGC 1333 and Serpens South, and with the dust temperatures observed

of the intracluster medium (ICM) in cooling-core galaxy clusters and groups,
thereby preventing a cooling catastrophe. However, the physical mechanism(s) by
which the directed flow of kinetic energy is thermalized throughout the ICM
core remains unclear. We examine one widely discussed mechanism whereby the AGN
induces subsonic turbulence in the ambient medium, the dissipation of which
provides the ICM heat source. Through controlled inviscid 3-d hydrodynamic
simulations, we verify that explosive AGN-like events can launch gravity waves
(g-modes) into the ambient ICM which in turn decay to volume-filling
turbulence. In our model, however, this process is found to be inefficient,
with less than 1% of the energy injected by the AGN activity actually ending up
in the turbulence of the ambient ICM. This efficiency is an order of magnitude
or more too small to explain the observations of AGN-feedback in galaxy
clusters and groups with short central cooling times. Atmospheres in which the
g-modes are strongly trapped/confined have an even lower efficiency since, in
these models, excitation of turbulence relies on the g-modes' ability to escape
from the center of the cluster into the bulk ICM. Our results suggest that, if
AGN-induced turbulence is indeed the mechanism by which the AGN heats the ICM
core, its driving may rely on physics beyond that captured in our ideal

derive dynamical masses from the kinematics and sizes and compare them to
baryonic masses, with gas masses estimated from dust-corrected H$\alpha$ star
formation rates (SFRs) and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. When assuming that
galaxies with and without observed rotation have the same median
$(V/\sigma_{V,0})_{R_E}$, we find good agreement between the dynamical and
baryonic masses, with a scatter of $\sigma_{RMS}=0.34$dex and a median offset
of $\Delta\log_{10}M=0.04$dex. This comparison implies a low dark matter
fraction (8% within an effective radius) for a Chabrier initial mass function
(IMF), and disfavors a Salpeter IMF. Moreover, the requirement that
$M_{dyn}/M_{baryon}$ should be independent of inclination yields a median value
of $(V/\sigma_{V,0})_{R_E}=2.1$ for galaxies without observed rotation. If
instead we treat the galaxies without detected rotation as early-type galaxies,
the masses are also in reasonable agreement ($\Delta\log_{10}M=-0.07$dex,
$\sigma_{RMS}=0.37$dex). The inclusion of gas masses is critical in this
comparison; if gas masses are excluded there is an increasing trend of
$M_{dyn}/M_{*}$ with higher specific SFR (SSFR). Furthermore, we find
indications that $V/\sigma$ decreases with increasing H$\alpha$ SSFR for our
full sample, which may reflect disk settling. We also study the Tully-Fisher
relation and find that at fixed stellar mass
$S_{0.5}=(0.5V_{2.2}^2+\sigma_{V,0}^2)^{1/2}$ was higher at earlier times. At
fixed baryonic mass, we observe the opposite trend. [abridged]

inclined galaxies have the lowest covering fractions due to minimized
outflow/inflow cross-section geometry. Absorbing galaxies also have bluer
colors while non-absorbers have redder colors, suggesting that star-formation
is a key driver in the OVI detection rate. OVI surrounding blue galaxies exists
primarily along the projected minor axis with wide opening angles while OVI
surrounding red galaxies exists primarily along the projected major axis with
smaller opening angles, which may explain why absorption around red galaxies is
less frequently detected. Our results are consistent with CGM originating from
major axis-fed inflows/recycled gas and from minor axis-driven outflows.
Non-detected OVI occurs between $\Phi=20-60^{\circ}$, suggesting that OVI is
not mixed throughout the CGM and remains confined within the outflows and the

from winds and supernovae, radiative cooling and self-gravity to study whether
a realistic distribution of OB associations in a massive proto-GC of initial

interferometer imaging offers a promising method to identify a large and
uniform sample of binary AGNs, because it probes a generic feature of nuclear
activity and is free from dust obscuration. Our previous search yielded 52
strong candidates of kpc-scale binaries over the 92 deg$^2$ of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 area with 2""-resolution Very Large Array
(VLA) images. Here we present 0.3""-resolution VLA 6 GHz observations for six
candidates that have complete optical spectroscopy. The new data confirm the
binary nature of four candidates and identify the other two as line-of-sight
projections of radio structures from single AGNs. The four binary AGNs at $z
\sim 0.1$ reside in major mergers with projected separations of 4.2-12 kpc.
Optical spectral modeling shows that their hosts have stellar masses between
$10.3 < log(M_\star/M_\odot) < 11.5$ and velocity dispersions between $120 <
\sigma_\star < 320$ km/s. The radio emission is compact ($<$0.4"") and show
steep spectrum ($-1.8 < \alpha < -0.5$) at 6 GHz. The host galaxy properties
and the Eddington-scaled accretion rates broadly correlate with the excitation
state, similar to the general radio-AGN population at low redshifts. Our
estimated binary AGN fraction indicates that simultaneous accretion occurs
$>23^{+15}_{-8}$% of the time when a kpc-scale galaxy pair is detectable as a
radio-AGN. The high duty cycle of the binary phase strongly suggests that major

a fundamental outcome of the star formation process. Recent observational and
theoretical work has suggested that $\Gamma$ increases with the gas surface
density ($\Sigma$) or star formation rate (SFR) surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$), both within galaxies and between different ones. However, a recent
paper by Chandar et al. has challenged these results, showing that the $total$
number of stellar aggregates per unit SFR does not vary systematically with the
host galaxy's absolute SFR. In this Letter, we show that no variations are
expected when no distinction is made between bound and unbound aggregates,
because the sum of these two fractions should be close to unity. We also
demonstrate that any scaling of $\Gamma$ with the absolute SFR is much weaker
than with $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, due to the mass-radius-SFR relation of
star-forming 'main sequence' galaxies. The environmental variation of $\Gamma$
should therefore be probed as a function of area-normalised quantities, such as
$\Sigma$ or $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. We present a set of guidelines for meaningful

two-dimensional domain, which is relevant to studying quorum sensing behavior
on thin substrates. In this model, spatially segregated dynamically active
signaling cells of a common small radius $\epsilon\ll 1$ are coupled through a
passive bulk diffusion field. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is
used to construct steady-state solutions and to formulate a spectral problem
that characterizes the linear stability properties of these solutions, with the
aim of predicting whether temporal oscillations can be triggered by the
cell-bulk coupling. Phase diagrams in parameter space where such collective
oscillations can occur are illustrated for two specific choices of the
intracellular kinetics. In the limit of very large bulk diffusion, it is shown
that the ODE-PDE system can be approximated by a finite-dimensional dynamical
system, which is studied both analytically and numerically. For one
illustrative example of the theory it is shown that when the number of cells
exceeds some critical number, the bulk diffusion field can trigger oscillations
that would otherwise not occur without the coupling. Moreover, for two specific
models for the intracellular dynamics, we show that there are rather wide
regions in parameter space where these triggered oscillations are synchronous
in nature. Unless the bulk diffusivity is asymptotically large, it is shown
that a clustered spatial configuration of cells inside the domain leads to
larger regions in parameter space where synchronous collective oscillations
between the small cells can occur. Finally, the linear stability analysis for
these cell-bulk models is shown to be qualitatively rather similar to that of
localized spot patterns for activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion systems in
the limit of long-range inhibition and short-range activation.

Therefore, inverse modeling method based on the information contained in the
deposit is an indispensable way of deciphering the quantitative characteristics
of the tsunamis, e.g., the flow speed and the flow depth. While several models
have been proposed to perform tsunami inversion, i.e., to infer the tsunami
characteristics based on the sediment deposits, the existing methods lack
mathematical rigorousness and are not able to account for uncertainties in the
inferred quantities. In this work, we propose an inversion scheme based on
Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) to infer tsunami characteristics from sediment
deposits. In contrast to traditional data assimilation methods using EnKF, a
novelty of the current work is that we augment the system state to include both
the physical variables (sediment fluxes) that are observable and the unknown
parameters (flow speed and flow depth) to be inferred. Based on the rigorous
Bayesian inference theory, the inversion scheme provides quantified
uncertainties on the inferred quantities, which clearly distinguishes the
present method with existing schemes for tsunami inversion. Two test cases with
synthetic observation data are used to verify the proposed inversion scheme.
Numerical results show that the tsunami characteristics inferred from the
sediment deposit information have a favorable agreement with the truths, which
demonstrated the merits of the proposed tsunami inversion scheme.

the thermal decay rates are significantly different for thermalizing and
non-thermalizing walls. We also show that, for transient transport, the

whether these detections represent SNR-MC interactions. One of the targets

EFFs in describing the size-dependent dimensionality and diverse geometries
exhibited by Au clusters (e.g., planar, hollow cages, pyramids). Owing to their
ability to account for bond directionality, bond-order based EFFs, such as the
Tersoff-type Bond Order Potential (BOP), are well suited for such a
description. Nevertheless, the predictive power of existing BOP parameters is
severely limited in the nm length scale owing to the predominance of bulk Au
properties used to train them. Here, we mitigate this issue by introducing a
new hybrid bond order potential (HyBOP), which account for (a) short-range
interactions via Tersoff-type BOP terms and (b) long-range effects by a scaled
LJ term whose contribution depends on the local atomic density. We optimized
the independent parameters for our HyBOP using a global optimization scheme
driven by genetic algorithms. Moreover, to ensure good transferability of these
parameters across different length scales, we used an extensive training
dataset encompasses structural and energetic properties of a thousand 13-atom
Au clusters, surface energies, as well as bulk polymorphs, obtained from
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our newly developed HyBOP has
been found to accurately describe (a) global minimum energy configurations at
different clusters sizes, (b) critical size of transition from planar to
globular clusters, (c) evolution of structural motifs with cluster size, and
(d) thermodynamics, structure, elastic properties of bulk polymorphs as well as

promising candidate being so-called `York time'. The dynamical equations for
matter and spatial geometry in York time may be obtained via Hamiltonian
reduction, that is, by solving the Hamiltonian constraint for the physical,
non-vanishing Hamiltonian density identified as the variable conjugate to the
chosen time parameter. Yet in general this equation cannot be solved
algebraically. Here we show how in a cosmological scenario, where one may treat
geometric and matter inhomogeneities as small perturbations, one is able to
obtain the physical Hamiltonian density by solving the constraint equation
perturbatively. By construction the Hamiltonian density is quadratic in the
perturbation variables, which makes it easily quantisable, although subtleties
arise due to the non-canonical form of the Poisson brackets and the

  Until 2014, the UN MMEIG used a multilevel regression model for producing
estimates for countries without sufficient data from vital registration
systems. While this model worked well in the past to assess MMR levels for
countries with limited data, it was deemed unsatisfactory for final MDG 5
reporting for countries where longer time series of observations had become
available because by construction, estimated trends in the MMR were
covariate-driven only and did not necessarily track data-driven trends.
  We developed a Bayesian maternal mortality estimation model, which extends
upon the UN MMEIG multilevel regression model. The new model assesses
data-driven trends through the inclusion of an ARIMA time series model that
captures accelerations and decelerations in the rate of change in the MMR.
Varying reporting and data quality issues are accounted for in source-specific

contrast to intuitive expectations that rather strong traveling waves can
destroy the soliton, it occurs that the soliton survives during its interaction

parameters begin to evolve under the influence of this interaction. If a
traveling electromagnetic wave possesses a finite duration, the soliton
parameters after interaction take constant values again, but these values in

examples are hyperhoneycomb and stripy-honeycomb lattices, which are realized
in $\beta $-Li$_{2}$IrO$_{3}$ and $\gamma $-Li$_{2}$IrO$_{3}$, respectively. We
propose a wide class of three-dimensional (3D) honeycomb lattices which are
loop-nodal semimetals. Their edge states have intriguing properties similar to
the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice in spite of dimensional difference.
Partial flat bands emerge at the zigzag or beard edge of the 3D honeycomb
lattice, whose boundary is given by the Fermi loop in the bulk spectrum.
Analytic solutions are explicitly constructed for them. On the other hand,
perfect flat bands emerge in the zigzag-beard edge or when the anisotropy is
large. All these 3D honeycomb lattices become strong topological insulators
with the inclusion of the spin-orbit interaction. Furthermore, point-nodal
semimetals may be realized in the presence of both the antiferromagnetic order
and the spin-orbit interaction.

complex disorders, including cancer. Computational approaches such as network
analysis are important tools to understand system dynamics as well as to
identify critical components that could be further explored as therapeutic
targets. Here, we performed perturbation analysis of a large-scale signal
transduction model in extracellular environments that stimulate cell death,
growth, motility, and quiescence. Each of the model's components was perturbed
under both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations. We identified the
most and least influential components based on the magnitude of their influence
on the rest of the system. Based on the premise that the most influential
components might serve as better drug targets, we characterized them for
biological functions, housekeeping genes, essential genes, and druggable
proteins. Moreover, known cancer drug targets were also classified in
influential components based on the affected components in the network.
Additionally, the systemic perturbation analysis of the model revealed a
network motif of most influential components which affect each other.
Furthermore, our analysis predicted novel combinations of cancer drug targets
with various effects on other most influential components. We found that the
combinatorial perturbation consisting of PI3K inactivation and overactivation
of IP3R1 can lead to increased activity levels of apoptosis-related components
and tumor suppressor genes, suggesting that this combinatorial perturbation may
lead to a better target for decreasing cell proliferation and inducing
apoptosis. Lastly, our results suggest that systematic perturbation analyses of
large-scale computational models may serve as an approach to prioritize and
assess signal transduction components in order to identify novel drug targets
in complex disorders.

hybrid beamformings of the source, relay and each destination by leveraging
compressive sensing techniques. Simulation results confirm that the proposed
hybrid beamforming design achieves performance very close to that of the

fundamental clue as to the origin of our Solar system. We investigate a
formation scenario of chondrules that involves planetesimal collisions and the
resultant impact jetting. Planetesimal collisions are the main agent to
regulate planetary accretion that corresponds to the formation of terrestrial
planets and cores of gas giants. The key component of this scenario is that
ejected materials can melt when the impact velocity between colliding
planetesimals exceeds about 2.5 km s$^{-1}$. The previous simulations show that
the process is efficient enough to reproduce the primordial abundance of
chondrules. We examine this scenario carefully by performing semi-analytical
calculations that are developed based on the results of direct $N$-body
simulations. As found by the previous work, we confirm that planetesimal
collisions that occur during planetary accretion can play an important role in
forming chondrules. This arises because protoplanet-planetesimal collisions can
achieve the impact velocity of about 2.5 km s$^{-1}$ or higher, as protoplanets
approach the isolation mass ($M_{p,iso}$). Assuming that the ejected mass is a
fraction ($F_{ch}$) of colliding planetesimals' mass, we show that the
resultant abundance of chondrules is formulated well by $F_{ch}M_{p,iso}$, as
long as the formation of protoplanets is completed within a given disk
lifetime. We perform a parameter study and examine how the abundance of
chondrules and their formation timing change. We find that the impact jetting
scenario generally works reasonably well for a certain range of parameters,
while more dedicated work would be needed to include other physical processes
that are neglected in this work and to examine their effects on chondrule
formation.

The analysis is further extended to characterize a network-level performance

large class of non-local pairwise interaction problems defined over probability
distributions. The approach predicts candidate global minimizers, with a
recovery guarantee, that are sometimes exact, and often within a few percent of
the optimum energy (under appropriate normalization of the energy). The
procedure relies on a convex relaxation of the pairwise energy that exploits
translational symmetry, followed by a recovery procedure that minimizes a
relative entropy. Numerical discretizations of the convex relaxation yield a
linear programming problem over convex cones that can be solved using
well-known methods. One advantage of the approach is that it provides
sufficient conditions for global minimizers to a non-convex quadratic
variational problem, in the form of a linear, convex, optimization problem for
the auto-correlation of the probability density. We demonstrate the approach in
a periodic domain for examples arising from models in materials, social
phenomena and flocking. The approach also exactly recovers the global minimizer
when a lattice of Dirac masses solves the convex relaxation. An important
by-product of the relaxation is a decomposition of the pairwise energy
functional into the sum of a convex functional and non-convex functional. We
observe that in some cases, the non-convex component of the decomposition can
be used to characterize the support of the recovered minimizers.

sense to those which are almost simple. If an almost simple subgroup of $G$ has
a socle which is not isomorphic to a group of Lie type in the underlying
characteristic of $G$, then the subgroup is called non-generic. This paper
considers non-generic subgroups of simple algebraic groups of exceptional type
in arbitrary characteristic.
  A finite subgroup is called Lie primitive if it lies in no proper subgroup of
positive dimension. We prove here that many non-generic subgroup types,
including the alternating and symmetric groups $\text{Alt}_{n}$,
$\text{Sym}_{n}$ for $n \ge 10$, do not occur as Lie primitive subgroups of an
exceptional algebraic group.
  A subgroup of $G$ is called $G$-completely reducible if, whenever it lies in
a parabolic subgroup of $G$, it lies in a conjugate of the corresponding Levi
factor. Here, we derive a fairly short list of possible isomorphism types of
non-$G$-completely reducible, non-generic simple subgroups.
  As an intermediate result, for each simply connected $G$ of exceptional type,
and each non-generic finite simple group $H$ which embeds into $G/Z(G)$, we
derive a set of feasible characters, which restrict the possible composition
factors of $V \downarrow S$, whenever $S$ is a subgroup of $G$ with image $H$
in $G/Z(G)$, and $V$ is either the Lie algebra of $G$ or a non-trivial Weyl
module for $G$ of least dimension.
  This has implications for the subgroup structure of the finite groups of
exceptional Lie type. For instance, we show that for $n \ge 10$, $\text{Alt}_n$
and $\text{Sym}_n$, as well as numerous other almost simple groups, cannot
occur as a maximal subgroup of an almost simple group whose socle is a finite
simple group of exceptional Lie type.

switching current is significantly reduced compared with the switching caused
solely by the spin transfer torque when the microwave frequency is in a certain
range. We develop a theory of switching from the LLG equation averaged over a
constant energy curve. It was found that the switching current should be
classified into four regions, depending on the values of the microwave
frequency. Based on the analysis, we derive an analytical formula of the
optimized frequency minimizing the switching current, which is smaller than the
ferromagnetic resonance frequency. We also derive an analytical formula of the
minimized switching current. Both the optimized frequency and the minimized

birth of a sonic black hole in an outcoupled Bose-Einstein condensate after
relaxing the confinement provided by an optical lattice. We also study possible
signatures of spontaneous Hawking radiation. We propose that the violation of
CS inequalities is a smoking gun of the presence of the Hawking effect. We
compare this criterion with the presence of entaglement, finding that both are
equivalent under usual assumptions. Finally, we study a different gravitational
analogue: the so-called black-hole laser. The most interesting result is the
appearance of a regime of continuous and periodic emission of solitons,
providing the most strong analogue with optical lasers. In the second part, we
analyze the effect of the introduction of a short Bragg pulse in a thermal
cloud. We show that the induced periodic density pattern decays to the
equilibrium profile. However, instead of the usual collisional relaxation, the
mechanism responsible for the decay is the thermal disorder of the particles,
with a characteristic time that only depends on the temperature. We find a very
good agreement with actual experimental data. In the last part, we switch to a
very different system: the $\nu=0$ quantum Hall state of bilayer graphene.
After re-deriving the corresponding mean-field phase diagram, we compute the
collective modes within the zero Landau level. Among the most remarkable
results, we have found that at the boundary between the FLP and the F phases a
gapless mode appears resulting from an accidental symmetry that can be regarded
as a remanent of a broken $SO(5)$ symmetry. On the other hand, the CAF and PLP

Head motion in fMRI acquired using slice-based Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) can be
estimated and compensated by aligning the images onto a reference volume
through image registration. However, registering EPI images volume to volume
fails to consider head motion between slices, which may lead to severely biased
head motion estimates. Slice-to-volume registration can be used to estimate
motion parameters for each slice by more accurately representing the image
acquisition sequence. However, accurate slice to volume mapping is dependent on
the information content of the slices: middle slices are information rich,
while edge slides are information poor and more prone to distortion. In this
work, we propose a Gaussian particle filter based head motion tracking
algorithm to reduce the image misregistration errors. The algorithm uses a
dynamic state space model of head motion with an observation equation that
models continuous slice acquisition of the scanner. Under this model the
particle filter provides more accurate motion estimates and voxel position
estimates. We demonstrate significant performance improvement of the proposed
approach as compared to registration-only methods of head motion estimation and
brain activation detection.

Chern-Simons theory in Euclidean space or $SL(2,{\bf R})\times SL(2,{\bf R})$
Chern-Simons theory in Minkowski space. This theory, which has also been
proposed as a soluble model for 2+1 dimensional quantum gravity, and its N=1
supersymmetric cousin, provide effective descriptions of FQHE. The principal
series corresponds to quantized levels for the two $SL(2,{\bf R})$'s such that
the diagonal $SL(2,{\bf R})$ has level $ 1$. The model predicts, contrary to
standard lore, that for principal series of FQH systems the quasiholes possess
non-abelian statistics. For the multi-layer case we propose that complex ADE
Chern-Simons theories provide effective descriptions, where the rank of the ADE
is mapped to the number of layers. Six dimensional $(2,0)$ ADE theories on the
Riemann surface $\Sigma$ provides a realization of FQH systems in M-theory.
Moreover we propose that the q-deformed version of Chern-Simons theories are
related to the anisotropic limit of FQH systems which splits the zeroes of the
Laughlin wave function. Extensions of the model to 3+1 dimensions, which
realize topological insulators with non-abelian topologically twisted

\big(a(y)(x)\nabla u(y)(x)\big) \ = \ f(x) \quad x \in D, \ y \in
[-1,1]^\infty, \quad u|_{\partial D} \ = \ 0, \end{equation} where $D \subset
{\mathbb R}^m$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain, $[-1,1]^\infty$, $f \in L_2(D)$,
and the diffusions $a$ satisfy the uniform ellipticity assumption and are
affinely dependent with respect to $y$. The parametric variable $y$ may be
deterministic or random. In the present paper, a central question to be studied
is as follows. Assume that we have an approximation property that there is a
sequence of finite element approximations with a certain error convergence rate
in energy norm of the space $V:=H^1_0(D)$ for the nonparametric problem $-
\operatorname{dv} \big(a(y_0)(x)\nabla u(y_0)(x)\big) = f(x)$ at every point
$y_0 \in [-1,1]^\infty$. Then under what assumptions does this sequence induce
a sequence of finite element approximations with the same error convergence
rate for the parametric elliptic problem in the norm of the Bochner spaces
$L_\infty([-1,1]^\infty,V)$ or $L_2([-1,1]^\infty,V)$? We solved this question
by linear collective Taylor, collocation and Galerkin methods, based on Taylor
expansions, Lagrange polynomial interpolations and Legendre polynomials
expansions, respectively, on the parametric domain $[-1,1]^\infty$. Under very
light conditions, we show that all these approximation methods give the same
error convergence rate as that by the sequence of finite element approximations
for the nonparametric elliptic problem. The parametric infinite-variate part
completely disappears from the convergence rate and influences only the
constant. Hence the curse of dimensionality is broken by linear methods.

nonlinear quenching of the dynamo is alleviated by inclusion of small-scale
advective and diffusive magnetic helicity fluxes, which allow the gauge
invariant magnetic helicity to be transferred outside the disk and consequently
build up a corona during the course of dynamo action. The time-dependent dynamo
equations are expressed in a separable form and solved through an eigenvector
expansion constructed using the steady-state solutions of the dynamo equation.
The parametric evolution of the dynamo solution allows us to estimate the final
structure of the global magnetic field and the saturated value of the
turbulence parameter $\alpha_m$, even before solving the dynamical equations
for evolution of magnetic fields in the disk and the corona, along with
$\alpha$-quenching. We then solve these equations simultaneously to study the
saturation of large-scale magnetic field, its dependence on the small-scale
magnetic helicity fluxes and corresponding evolution of the force-free field in
the corona. The quadrupolar large-scale magnetic field in the disk is found to
reach equipartition strength within a timescale of 1 Gyr. The large-scale
magnetic field in the corona obtained is much weaker in strength compared to
the field inside the disk and has only a weak impact on the dynamo operation.

exhibit signatures of what can be called spontaneous dynamical long-range order
(DLRO). This order's omnipresence has long been recognized by the scientific
community, as evidenced by a myriad of related concepts, theoretical and
phenomenological frameworks, and experimental phenomena such as turbulence,
$1/f$ noise, dynamical complexity, chaos and the butterfly effect, the Richter
scale for earthquakes and the scale-free statistics of other sudden processes,
self-organization and pattern formation, self-organized criticality, etc.
Although several successful approaches to various realizations of DLRO have
been established, the universal theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remained elusive. The possibility of constructing a unified theory of DLRO has
emerged recently within the approximation-free supersymmetric theory of
stochastics (STS). There, DLRO is the spontaneous breakdown of the topological
or de Rham supersymmetry that all stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
possess. This theory may be interesting to researchers with very different
backgrounds because the ubiquitous DLRO is a truly interdisciplinary entity.
The STS is also an interdisciplinary construction. This theory is based on
dynamical systems theory, cohomological field theories, the theory of
pseudo-Hermitian operators, and the conventional theory of SDEs. Reviewing the
literature on all these mathematical disciplines can be time-consuming. As
such, a concise and self-contained introduction to the STS, the goal of this

We
quantize the initial data of dynamical variables at the Planck epoch, where the
Hubble parameter coincides with the Planck mass. These initial data are defined
via the Fock simplex in the tangent Minkowskian space-time and the Dirac
conformal interval. The Einstein cosmological principle is applied for the
average of the spatial metric determinant logarithm over the spatial volume of
the visible Universe. We derive the splitting of the general coordinate
transformations into the diffeomorphisms (as the object of the second N\""other
theorem) and the initial data transformations (as objects of the first N\""other
theorem). Following von Neumann, we suppose that the vacuum state is a quantum
ensemble. The vacuum state is degenerated with respect to quantum numbers of
non-vacuum states with the distribution function that yields the Casimir effect
in gravidynamics in analogy to the one in electrodynamics. The generation
functional of the perturbation theory in gravidynamics is given as a solution
of the quantum energy constraint. We discuss the region of applicability of
gravidynamics and its possible predictions for explanation of the modern
observational and experimental data.

diffraction terms are all evanescent waves and the interlayer distance is far
enough for them to decay out. Scattering theory enables the calculation of
transmission and reflection coefficients of a finite sized slab, and we extract
the effective parameters such as the impedance ($Z_e$) and the refractive index
($n_e$) using a parameter retrieval method. We note that $n_e$ is uniquely
defined only in a very limited region of the reciprocal space. ($n_e k_0 a<<1$,

effective impedance $Z_e$ is purely real for the pass band and purely imaginary
in the band gaps. Using the sign of the imaginary part of $Z_e$, we can

distinguish experimentally between shear modulus induced period shifts and
period shifts resulting from other physical mechanisms through the use of

squeezing is a viable alternative, so far that has not been properly exploited
for the nuclear spins. Of particular relevance in solids is the electric
quadrupole interaction (QI), which operates on nuclei having spin higher than
1/2. In its general form, QI involves an electric field gradient (EFG)
biaxiality term. Here, we show that as this EFG biaxiality increases, it
enables continuous tuning of single-particle squeezing from the one-axis
twisting to the two-axis countertwisting limits. A detailed analysis of QI
squeezing is provided, exhibiting the intricate consequences of EFG biaxiality.
The initial states over the Bloch sphere are mapped out to identify those
favorable for fast initial squeezing, or for prolonged squeezings. Furthermore,
the evolution of squeezing in the presence of a phase-damping channel and an
external magnetic field are investigated. We observe that dephasing drives
toward an anti-squeezed terminal state, the degree of which increases with the
spin angular momentum. Finally, QI squeezing in the limiting case of a
two-dimensional EFG with a perpendicular magnetic field is discussed, which is
of importance for two-dimensional materials, and the associated beat patterns

arbitrary dimension, which allows for grids for curved domains. Even more, the
grids are not expected to have a manifold structure, i.e., more than two
elements can share a common facet. This makes FoamGrid the grid data structure
of choice for simulating structures such as foams, discrete fracture networks,
or network flow problems. FoamGrid implements adaptive non-conforming
refinement with element parametrizations. As an additional feature it allows
removal and addition of elements in an existing grid, which makes FoamGrid
suitable for network growth problems. We show how to use FoamGrid, with
particular attention to the extensions of the grid interface needed to handle
non-manifold topology and grid growth. Three numerical examples demonstrate the
possibilities offered by FoamGrid.

recognition and detection. However, AI models still fail to match humans in
high-level vision tasks due to the lack of capacities for deeper reasoning.
Recently the new task of visual question answering (QA) has been proposed to
evaluate a model's capacity for deep image understanding. Previous works have
established a loose, global association between QA sentences and images.
However, many questions and answers, in practice, relate to local regions in
the images. We establish a semantic link between textual descriptions and image
regions by object-level grounding. It enables a new type of QA with visual
answers, in addition to textual answers used in previous work. We study the
visual QA tasks in a grounded setting with a large collection of 7W
multiple-choice QA pairs. Furthermore, we evaluate human performance and
several baseline models on the QA tasks. Finally, we propose a novel LSTM model
with spatial attention to tackle the 7W QA tasks.

  End-to-End Solution for All-Optical Data Centers",,,,,"cs.NI math.OC math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  All-optical switching networks have been considered a promising candidate for
the next generation data center networks thanks to its scalability in data
bandwidth and power efficiency. However, the bufferless nature and the nonzero
recon- figuration delay of optical switches remain great challenges in
deploying all-optical networks. This paper considers the end-to- end scheduling
for all-optical data center networks with no in- network buffer and nonzero
reconfiguration delay. A framework is proposed to deal with the nonzero
reconfiguration delay. The proposed approach constructs an adaptive variant of
any given scheduling policy. It is shown that if a scheduling policy guarantees
its schedules to have schedule weights close to the MaxWeight schedule (and
thus is throughput optimal in the zero reconfiguration regime), then the
throughput optimality is inherited by its adaptive variant (in any nonzero
reconfiguration delay regime). As a corollary, a class of adaptive variants of
the well known MaxWeight policy is shown to achieve throughput optimality
without prior knowledge of the traffic load. Further- more, through numerical
simulations, the simplest such policy, namely the Adaptive MaxWeight (AMW), is
shown to exhibit better delay performance than all prior work.

photometry for the group of CP stars has never been performed. Nowadays, there
is a great deal of data available in the NIR that reach very large distances.
It is therefore very important for CP stars to be unambiguously detected in the
NIR region and for these detections to be used to derive astrophysical
parameters (age and mass) by applying isochrone fitting. Furthermore, we
investigated whether the CP stars behave in a different way to normal-type
stars in the various photometric diagrams. For our analysis, we carefully
compiled a sample of CP and apparently normal (non-peculiar) type stars. Only
stars for which high-quality (i.e. with low error levels), astrometric, and
photometric data are available were chosen. In total, 639 normal and 622 CP
stars were selected and further analysed. All stars were dereddened and
calibrated in terms of the effective temperature and absolute magnitude

astrophysical parameters derived from 2MASS and Johnson UBV photometry were
found. Furthermore, no statistical significant deviations from the normal type
stars within several colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams were
discovered. Therefore, it is not possible to detect new CP stars with the help

the present-day photospheric abundances observed in extremely metal-poor stars
are representative of their natal gas cloud composition. For this reason, the
chemistry of extremely metal-poor stars closely reflects the nucleosynthetic
yields of supernovae from massive Population III stars. Here we collate
detailed abundances of 53 extremely metal-poor stars from the literature and
infer the masses of their Population III progenitors. We fit a simple initial
mass function to a subset of 29 of theinferred Population III star masses, and
find that the mass distribution is well-represented by a power law IMF with
exponent $\alpha = 2.35^{+0.29}_{-0.24}$. The inferred maximum progenitor mass
for supernovae from massive Population III stars is $M_{\rm{max}} =
87^{+13}_{-33}$ M$_\odot$, and we find no evidence in our sample for a
contribution from stars with masses above $\sim$120 M$_\odot$. The minimum mass
is strongly consistent with the theoretical lower mass limit for Population III
supernovae. We conclude that the IMF for massive Population III stars is
consistent with the initial mass function of present-day massive stars and
there may well have formed stars much below the supernova mass limit that could
have survived to the present day.

addition to the old teleological question, this paper continues the recent
discussion regarding the modal involvement of the principle of least action and
its relations with the Humean view of the laws of nature. The reality of
possible paths in the principle of least action is examined from the
perspectives of the contemporary metaphysics of modality and Leibniz's concept
of essences or possibles striving for existence. I elaborate a modal
interpretation of the principle of least action that replaces a classical
representation of a system's motion along a single history in the actual
modality by simultaneous motions along an infinite set of all possible
histories in the possible modality. This model is based on an intuition that
deep ontological connections exist between the possible paths in the principle
of least action and possible quantum histories in the Feynman path integral. I
interpret the action as a physical measure of the essence of every possible
history. Therefore only one actual history has the highest degree of the
essence and minimal action. To address the issue of necessity, I assume that
the principle of least action has a general physical necessity and lies between
the laws of motion with a limited physical necessity and certain laws with a
metaphysical necessity.

Class II T Tauri star continuum and line observations. We systematically study
the impact of each model parameter (disk mass, disk extension and shape, dust
settling, dust size and opacity, gas/dust ratio, etc.) on all continuum and
line observables, in particular on the SED, mm-slope, continuum visibilities,
and emission lines including [OI] 63um, high-J CO lines, (sub-)mm CO
isotopologue lines, and CO fundamental ro-vibrational lines. We find that
evolved dust properties (large grains) often needed to fit the SED, have
important consequences for disk chemistry and heating/cooling balance, leading
to stronger emission lines in general. Strong dust settling and missing disk
flaring have similar effects on continuum observations, but opposite effects on
far-IR gas emission lines. PAH molecules can shield the gas from stellar UV
radiation because of their strong absorption and negligible scattering
opacities. The observable millimetre-slope of the SED can become significantly
more gentle in the case of cold disk midplanes, which we find regularly in our
T Tauri models. We propose to use line observations of robust chemical tracers
of the gas, such as O, CO, and H2, as additional constraints to determine some
key properties of the disks, such as disk shape and mass, opacities, and the
dust/gas ratio, by simultaneously fitting continuum and line observations.

capable of acquiring complete polarization information from single isolated
plasmonic nanoparticle/nanostructure. The outstanding issues pertaining to
reliable measurements of full 4X4 spectroscopic scattering Mueller matrices
from single nanoparticle/nanostructures are overcome by integrating an
efficient Mueller matrix measurement scheme and a robust calibration method
with a dark-field microscopic spectroscopy arrangement.The spectral
polarization responses of the required polarization state generator, analyzer

calibration, thus enabling recording of the spectral polarization response
(Mueller matrix) exclusively of the plasmonic system. Feasibility of
quantitative Mueller matrix polarimetryand its potential utility is illustrated
on a simple plasmonic system, that of gold nanorods. The demonstrated novel
ability to record full polarization information over a broad wavelength range
and to quantify the intrinsic plasmon polarimetry characteristics via Mueller
matrix inverse analysis should lead to a novel route towards quantitative
understanding, analysis / interpretation of a number of intricate plasmonic

The dynamics of the corresponding gravitational field is analyzed in a

account the torsion. In this context, the geometrical reason of the existence
of torsion due to the presence of gravitational waves, as an asymmetry of
connection coefficients with respect of the swapping of indices's is
highlighted. In a laser interferometer gravitational detector The delay time
between the arrivals of the two laser beams traveling back and forth along the

the breaking of the parallelogram formed by the trajectories of the laser beams

two specific orientations with respect of the experimental device,
corresponding to different polarizations of the gravitational waves. These
values are related to the relative length variation of the detector's arms in

processing. To investigate how these cues combine in the auditory system,
detection thresholds for an 800-Hz tone masked by a diotic (i.e., identical
between the ears) harmonic complex tone were measured in six normal-hearing
subjects. The target tone was presented either diotically or with an interaural
phase difference (IPD) of 180 degree and in either harmonic or ""mistuned""
relationship to the diotic masker. Three different maskers were used, a
resolved and an unresolved complex tone (fundamental frequency: 160 and 40 Hz)
with four components below and above the target frequency and a broadband
unresolved complex tone with 12 additional components. The target IPD provided
release from masking in most masker conditions, whereas mistuning led to a
significant release from masking only in the diotic conditions with the
resolved and the narrowband unresolved maskers. A significant effect of
mistuning was neither found in the diotic condition with the wideband
unresolved masker nor in any of the dichotic conditions. An auditory model with
a single analysis frequency band and different binaural processing schemes was
employed to predict the data of the unresolved masker conditions. Sensitivity
to modulation cues was achieved by including an auditory-motivated modulation
filter in the processing pathway. The predictions of the diotic data were in
line with the experimental results and literature data in the narrowband
condition, but not in the broadband condition, suggesting that across-frequency
processing is involved in processing modulation information. The experimental
and model results in the dichotic conditions show that the binaural processor
cannot exploit modulation information in binaurally unmasked conditions.

kSZ effect is one of the most promising probe of the {\em missing baryons} in
the Universe. We study the possibility of reconstructing it in three dimensions
(3D), using future spectroscopic surveys such as the Euclid survey. By
reconstructing a 3D template from galaxy density and peculiar velocity fields
from spectroscopic surveys we cross-correlate the estimator against CMB maps.
The resulting cross-correlation can help us to map out the kSZ contribution to
CMB in 3D as a function of redshift thereby extending previous results which
use tomographic reconstruction. This allows the separation of the late time
effect from the contribution owing to reionization. By construction, it avoids
contamination from foregrounds, primary CMB, tSZ effect as well as from star
forming galaxies. Due to a high number density of galaxies the signal-to-noise
(S/N) for such cross-correlational studies are higher, compared to the studies
involving CMB power spectrum analysis. Using a spherical Bessel-Fourier (sFB)
transform we introduce a pair of 3D power-spectra: ${\cal

accompanied by significant changes in spectral features, most of which are

the $C_2$ Swan system and CN Red system lines are stronger near the light
minimum. A photospheric spectrum of the central star was calculated using new
self-consistent atmospheric models. The observed intensity variations in the
$C_2$ Swan system and CN Red system lines were found to be much larger than
expected if due solely to the temperature variation in the atmosphere of the
pulsating star. In addition, the molecular lines are blueshifted relative to
the photospheric velocity. The site of formation of the strong molecular
features appears to be a cool outflow triggered by the pulsation. The
variability in atomic lines seems to be mostly due variations of the effective
temperature during the pulsation cycle. The profiles of strong atomic lines are

because of shock waves in the outer atmosphere.

sub-optimal bounds on the mass of Bowen balls.
  We present two new applications to our effective equidistribution result. The
first one is effective rigidity for the measure of maximal entropy on
S-arithmetic quotients with respect to a semisimple action in a non-archimedean
place. Measures having large enough metric entropy must also be close on the
state space to the Haar measure. This is a partial extension of a recent result
of R\""uhr to a significantly more general setting.
  The second one is non-escape of mass for sequences of measures having large
entropy with respect to a semisimple element in a non-archimedean place. This
generalizes similar known results for real flows. Our methods differ from the
methods used by R\""uhr and in the previously known non-escape of mass results.

derivative $_0^C\!D_t^\alpha f(t)$ of order $\alpha\in (0,1)$, which can be
expressed as a convolution of $f'(t)$ with the kernel $t^{-\alpha}$. The
algorithm is based on an efficient sum-of-exponentials approximation for the
kernel $t^{-1-\alpha}$ on the interval $[\Delta t, T]$ with a uniform absolute
error $\varepsilon$, where the number of exponentials $N_{\text{exp}}$ needed
is of the order
  $O\left(\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\left(
  \log\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\log\frac{T}{\Delta t}\right)
  +\log\frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(
  \log\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\log\frac{1}{\Delta t}\right)
  \right)$.
  As compared with the direct method, the resulting algorithm reduces the
storage requirement from $O(N_T)$ to $O(N_{\text{exp}})$ and the overall
computational cost from $O(N_T^2)$ to $O(N_TN_{\text{exp}})$ with $N_T$ the
total number of time steps. Furthermore, when the fast evaluation scheme of the
Caputo derivative is applied to solve the fractional diffusion equations, the
resulting algorithm requires only $O(N_SN_{\text{exp}})$ storage and
$O(N_SN_TN_{\text{exp}})$ work with $N_S$ the total number of points in space;
whereas the direct methods require $O(N_SN_T$) storage and $O(N_SN_T^2)$ work.
The complexity of both algorithms is nearly optimal since $N_{\text{exp}}$ is
of the order $O(\log N_T)$ for $T\gg 1$ or $O(\log^2N_T)$ for $T\approx 1$ for
fixed accuracy $\varepsilon$. We also present a detailed stability and error
analysis of the new scheme for solving linear fractional diffusion equations.
The performance of the new algorithm is illustrated via several numerical
examples. Finally, the algorithm can be parallelized in a straightforward
manner.

curves (CONSTANT, TRANSIT, VARIABLE, MLENS and EB for constant light curves,
transiting exoplanet, variable, microlensing events and eclipsing binaries,
respectively) to analyse the power of the method. The algorithm uses four
features in order to classify the light curves. The training sample contains
5000 light curves (1000 from each class) and 50000 random light curves for
testing. The total SIDRA success ratio is $\geq 90\%$. Furthermore, the success
ratio reaches 95 - 100$\%$ for the CONSTANT, VARIABLE, EB, and MLENS classes
and 92$\%$ for the TRANSIT class with a decision probability of 60$\%$. Because
the TRANSIT class is the one which fails the most, we run a simultaneous fit
using SIDRA and a Box Least Square (BLS) based algorithm for searching for
transiting exoplanets. As a result, our algorithm detects 7.5$\%$ more planets
than a classic BLS algorithm, with better results for lower signal-to-noise
light curves. SIDRA succeeds to catch 98$\%$ of the planet candidates in the
Kepler sample and fails for 7$\%$ of the false alarms subset. SIDRA promises to
be useful for developing a detection algorithm and/or classifier for large

structure of the underlying systems of multi-variate time series. In
particular, the direct causal effects are commonly estimated by the conditional
Granger causality index (CGCI). In the presence of many observed variables and
relatively short time series, CGCI may fail because it is based on vector
autoregressive models (VAR) involving a large number of coefficients to be
estimated. In this work, the VAR is restricted by a scheme that modifies the
recently developed method of backward-in-time selection (BTS) of the lagged
variables and the CGCI is combined with BTS. Further, the proposed approach is
compared favorably to other restricted VAR representations, such as the
top-down strategy, the bottom-up strategy, and the least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (LASSO), in terms of sensitivity and specificity of CGCI.
This is shown by using simulations of linear and nonlinear, low and
high-dimensional systems and different time series lengths. For nonlinear
systems, CGCI from the restricted VAR representations are compared with
analogous nonlinear causality indices. Further, CGCI in conjunction with BTS
and other restricted VAR representations is applied to multi-channel scalp
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of epileptic patients containing
epileptiform discharges. CGCI on the restricted VAR, and BTS in particular,
could track the changes in brain connectivity before, during and after
epileptiform discharges, which was not possible using the full VAR
representation.

We describe the challenge of calibrating climate simulators, and discuss the
differences in emphasis in climate science compared to many of the more
traditional ABC application areas. The primary difficulty is how to do
inference with a computationally expensive simulator which we can only afford
to run a small number of times, and we describe how Gaussian process emulators
are used as surrogate models in this case. We introduce the idea of history
matching, which is a non-probabilistic calibration method, which divides the
parameter space into (not im)plausible and implausible regions. History
matching can be shown to be a special case of ABC, but with a greater emphasis
on defining realistic simulator discrepancy bounds, and using these to define
tolerances and metrics. We describe a design approach for choosing parameter
values at which to run the simulator, and illustrate the approach on a toy
climate model, showing that with careful design we can find the plausible
region with a very small number of model evaluations. Finally, we describe how
calibrated GENIE-1 (an earth system model of intermediate complexity)
predictions have been used, and why it is important to accurately characterise
parametric uncertainty.

Networks (ConvNets), have achieved overwhelming accuracy with fast processing
speed for image classification. Incorporating temporal structure with deep
ConvNets for video representation becomes a fundamental problem for video
content analysis. In this paper, we propose a new approach, namely Hierarchical
Recurrent Neural Encoder (HRNE), to exploit temporal information of videos.
Compared to recent video representation inference approaches, this paper makes
the following three contributions. First, our HRNE is able to efficiently
exploit video temporal structure in a longer range by reducing the length of
input information flow, and compositing multiple consecutive inputs at a higher
level. Second, computation operations are significantly lessened while
attaining more non-linearity. Third, HRNE is able to uncover temporal
transitions between frame chunks with different granularities, i.e., it can
model the temporal transitions between frames as well as the transitions
between segments. We apply the new method to video captioning where temporal
information plays a crucial role. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art on video captioning benchmarks. Notably, even
using a single network with only RGB stream as input, HRNE beats all the recent
systems which combine multiple inputs, such as RGB ConvNet plus 3D ConvNet.

except the one with {\alpha}-GY, which however shows a hardening process due to
the formation of triple carbon rings. Such hardening process has greatly
deferred the failure of the structure. The yielding of the HJs is usually
initiated at the interface between graphene and graphene allotropes, and
monoatomic carbon rings are normally formed after yielding. By varying the
locations of graphene (either in the middle or at the two ends of the HJs),
similar mechanical properties have been obtained, suggesting insignificant
impacts from location of graphene allotropes. Whereas, changing the types and
percentages of the graphene allotropes, the HJs exhibit vastly different
mechanical properties. In general, with the increasing graphene percentage, the
yield strain decreases and the effective Young's modulus increases. Meanwhile,
the yield stress appears irrelevant with the graphene percentage. This study
provides a fundamental understanding of the tensile properties of the
heterojunctions that are crucial for the design and engineering of their

fluctuation-dissipation relations far from equilibrium in terms of effective
temperatures near quantum criticality. Finally, we present an analysis of a
non-interacting, critical reference system, the pseudogap resonant level model,
in terms of effective temperatures and contrast these results with those

real-world declarative process models to subjects and asked them to describe

varying the number of fitted input points and Pad\'{e} coefficients

including Sm and Pr atomic self-energies, the Green's functions of the Hubbard
model for a Bethe lattice and of the Haldane model for a nano-ribbon, as well
as two special test functions. The sensitivity to numerical noise and the
dependence on the precision of the numerical libraries are analysed in detail.
The present approach is compared to a number of other techniques, i.e. the
non-negative least-square method, the non-negative Tikhonov method and the
maximum entropy method, and is shown to perform well for the chosen test cases.
This conclusion holds even when the noise on the input data is increased to
reach values typical for quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The ability of the

we have carried out 2D numerical simulations to study vortex structure in

of the system by the lopsided structure. When only the indirect force is
included, we confirm the finding by Mittal & Chiang (2015) that the vortex
becomes stronger and can be more than two pressure scale heights wide, as long
as the disc-to-star mass ratio is >1%. Such wide vortices can excite strong
density waves in the disc and therefore migrate inwards rapidly. However, when
disc self-gravity is also considered in simulations, self-gravity plays a more
prominent role on the vortex structure. We confirm that when the disc Toomre Q
parameter is smaller than pi/(2h), where h is the disc's aspect ratio, the
vortices are significantly weakened and their inward migration slows down
dramatically. Most importantly, when the disc is massive enough (e.g. Q~3), we
find that the lopsided gas structure orbits around the star at a speed
significantly slower than the local Keplerian speed. This sub-Keplerian pattern
speed can lead to the concentration of dust particles at a radius beyond the
lopsided gas structure (as shown in Paper II). Overall, disc self-gravity
regulates the vortex structure in massive discs and the radial shift between
the gas and dust distributions in vortices within massive discs may be probed
by future observations.

transition discs via 2D hydrodynamical simulations including both gas and dust.
Our simulations adopt a ring-like gas density profile that becomes unstable
against the Rossby-wave instability and forms a large crescent-shaped vortex.
When gas self-gravity is discarded, but the indirect force from the
displacement of the star by the vortex is included, we confirm that dust grains
with stopping times of order the orbital time, which should be typically a few
centimetres in size, are trapped ahead of the vortex in the azimuthal
direction, while the smallest and largest grains concentrate towards the vortex
centre. We obtain maximum shift angles of about 25 degrees. Gas self-gravity
accentuates the concentration differences between small and large grains. At
low to moderate disc masses, the larger the grains, the farther they are
trapped ahead of the vortex. Shift angles up to 90 degrees are reached for 10
cm-sized grains, and we show that such large offsets can produce a
double-peaked continuum emission observable at mm/cm wavelengths. This
behaviour comes about because the large grains undergo horseshoe U-turns
relative to the vortex due to the vortex's gravity. At large disc masses, since
the vortex's pattern frequency becomes increasingly slower than Keplerian,
small grains concentrate slightly beyond the vortex and large grains form
generally non-axisymmetric ring-like structures around the vortex's radial
location. Gas self-gravity therefore imparts distinct trapping locations for
small and large dust grains which may be probed by current and future
observations, and which suggest that the formation of planetesimals in vortices
might be more difficult than previously thought.

pairwise disjoint simplices of $K$ do not have a common point. We show that if
$r$ is not a prime power and $d\geq 2r+1$, then there is a counterexample to
the topological Tverberg conjecture, i.e., there is an almost $r$-embedding of
the $(d+1)(r-1)$-simplex in $\mathbb R^d$. This improves on previous
constructions of counterexamples (for $d\geq 3r$) based on a series of papers
by M. \""Ozaydin, M. Gromov, P. Blagojevi\'c, F. Frick, G. Ziegler, and the
second and fourth present authors.
  The counterexamples are obtained by proving the following algebraic criterion
in codimension 2: If $r\ge3$ and if $K$ is a finite $2(r-1)$-complex then there
exists an almost $r$-embedding $K\to \mathbb R^{2r}$ if and only if there
exists a general position PL map $f:K\to \mathbb R^{2r}$ such that the
algebraic intersection number of the $f$-images of any $r$ pairwise disjoint
simplices of $K$ is zero. This result can be restated in terms of cohomological
obstructions or equivariant maps, and extends an analogous codimension 3
criterion by the second and fourth authors. As another application we classify
ornaments $f:S^3 \sqcup S^3\sqcup S^3\to \mathbb R^5$ up to ornament
concordance.
  It follows from work of M. Freedman, V. Krushkal and P. Teichner that the
analogous criterion for $r=2$ is false. We prove a lemma on singular
higher-dimensional Borromean rings, yielding an elementary proof of the
counterexample.

  Contextuality-by-Default Theory","to be published in Journal of Mathematical Psychology",,,,"math.PR quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper provides a systematic yet accessible presentation of the
Contextuality-by-Default theory. The consideration is confined to finite
systems of categorical random variables, which allows us to focus on the basics
of the theory without using full-scale measure-theoretic language.
Contextuality-by-Default is a theory of random variables identified by their
contents and their contexts, so that two variables have a joint distribution if
and only if they share a context. Intuitively, the content of a random variable
is the entity the random variable measures or responds to, while the context is
formed by the conditions under which these measurements or responses are
obtained. A system of random variables consists of stochastically unrelated
""bunches,"" each of which is a set of jointly distributed random variables
sharing a context. The variables that have the same content in different
contexts form ""connections"" between the bunches. A probabilistic coupling of
this system is a set of random variables obtained by imposing a joint
distribution on the stochastically unrelated bunches. A system is considered
noncontextual or contextual according to whether it can or cannot be coupled so
that the joint distributions imposed on its connections possess a certain
property (in the present version of the theory, ""maximality""). We present a
criterion of contextuality for a special class of systems of random variables,
called cyclic systems. We also introduce a general measure of contextuality
that makes use of (quasi-)couplings whose distributions may involve negative
numbers or numbers greater than 1 in place of probabilities.

Crelle paper 1997. He also showed that critical values of automorphic
L-functions for $GL_{n}\times GL_{1}$ can be interpreted in terms of these

ways. Firstly, the arithmetic automorphic periods have been defined over
general CM fields. We also prove that these periods factorize as products of
local periods over infinity places. Secondly, we show that critical values of
automorphic $L$ functions for $GL_{n}\times GL_{n'}$ can be interpreted in

that the automorphic periods are functorial for automorphic induction and
cyclic base change. We also define certain motivic periods if the motive is
restricted from a CM field to the field of rational numbers. We can calculate
Deligne's period for tensor product of two such motives. We see directly that
our automorphic results are compatible with Deligne's conjecture for motives.

capacity of the St\""uckelberg degrees of freedom that maintain gauge invariance

act as qubits that account for a certain fraction of quantum information. Their
information capacity is measured by the ratio of the inverse St\""uckelberg
energy gap to the size of the system. Systems with the smallest gap are
maximally holographic. For massless gauge systems this information measure is
universally equal to the inverse coupling evaluated at the systems' length
scale. In this language it becomes very transparent why the St\""uckelberg
information capacity of black holes saturates the Bekenstein bound and accounts
for the entire information of the system. The physical reason is that the
strength of quantum interaction is bounded from below by the gravitational
coupling, which scales as area. Observing the striking similarity between the
scalings of the energy gap of the boundary St\""uckelberg modes and the
Bogoliubov modes of critical many-body systems, we establish a connection
between holography and quantum criticality through the correspondence between
these modes.

collection of compact objects $\mathcal{K} \subset \mathcal{C}$ we construct
local cohomology and local homology functors satisfying an abstract version of
local duality. When specialized to the derived category of a commutative ring
$A$ and a suitable ideal in $A$, we recover the classical local duality due to
Grothendieck as well as generalizations by Greenlees and May. More generally,
applying our result to the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a
quasi-compact and separated scheme $X$ implies the local duality theorem of
Alonso Tarr\'io, Jerem\'ias L\'opez, and Lipman.
  As a second objective, we establish local duality for quasi-coherent sheaves
over many algebraic stacks, in particular those arising naturally in stable
homotopy theory. After constructing an appropriate model of the derived
category in terms of comodules over a Hopf algebroid, we show that, in familiar
cases, the resulting local cohomology and local homology theories coincide with
functors previously studied by Hovey and Strickland. Furthermore, our framework
applies to global and local stable homotopy theory, in a way which is
compatible with the algebraic avatars of these theories. In order to aid
computability, we provide spectral sequences relating the algebraic and
topological local duality contexts.

performance and cost efficiency lead to the trend of using commercial
off-the-shelf hardware. However, due to their highly integrated design they are
becoming increasingly susceptible to hardware errors (e.g. caused by
radiation-induced soft-errors or wear-out effects). Since such faults cannot be
fully prevented, systems have to cope with their effects. At the same time
there is the trend of multi-core processors in embedded systems. Approaches to
achieve fault tolerance by using the multiple cores to establish redundancy
have been presented in literature. However, typically only homogeneous
redundancy techniques are considered to tolerate soft errors. However, there is
a lack of appropriate reaction mechanisms for restoring the system in case of
permanent hardware faults.
  Here, we propose the basic idea of enhancing multi-core redundancy techniques
with a cost-efficient automated introduction of diversity in the executed
software replicas. Recently, these automated software diversity techniques have
attracted attention in the security domain. We propose to use these techniques
to recover from permanent hardware faults. This is achieved by adapting the
software execution in such a way that permanent faults are mitigated.

be at the origin of the fixation of a new genotype, if they give a phenotypic
advantage to the carriers of the new mutation. In this paper, we are interested
in the genetic signature left by a selective sweep induced by recurrent
mutations at a given locus from an allele A to an allele a, depending on the
mutation frequency. We distinguish three possible scales for the mutation
probability per reproductive event, which entail distinct genetic signatures.
Besides, we study the hydrodynamic limit of the A- and a-population size
dynamics when mutations are frequent, and find non trivial equilibria leading
to several possible patterns of polymorphism.

tight-binding is established by downfolding the physically relevant subset of
3d bands with e_g character by means of maximally localized Wannier functions
(MLWFs) using the VASP2WANNIER90 interface. The MLWFs are then used to
construct a tight-binding Hamiltonian. The dispersion of the TB e_g bands at
all levels are found to match closely the MLWFs. We provide a complete set of
TB parameters which can serve as guidance for the interpretation of future
studies based on many-body Hamiltonian approaches. In particular, we find that
the Hund's rule coupling strength, the Jahn-Teller coupling strength, and the
Hubbard interaction parameter U remain nearly constant for all the members of
the RMnO3 series, whereas the nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes show a
monotonic attenuation as expected from the trend of the tolerance factor.
Magnetic exchange interactions, computed by mapping a large set of hybrid
functional total energies onto an Heisenberg Hamiltonian, clarify the origin of
the A-type magnetic ordering observed in the early rare-earth manganite series

which are required for range-based positioning. However, UWB still faces a
problem with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) measurements, in which the range
estimates based on time-of-arrival (TOA) will typically be positively biased.
There are many techniques that address this problem, mainly based on NLOS
identification and NLOS error mitigation algorithms. However, these techniques
do not exploit all available information in the UWB channel impulse response.
Kernel-based machine learning methods, such as Gaussian Process Regression
(GPR), are able to make use of all information, but they may be too complex in
their original form. In this paper, we propose novel ranging methods based on
kernel principal component analysis (kPCA), in which the selected channel

evaluate the proposed methods using real UWB measurements obtained in a

parallel algorithms to tackle their computational solution. The Scheduled
Relaxation Jacobi (SRJ) is a promising class of methods, atypical for combining
simplicity and efficiency, that has been recently introduced for solving linear
Poisson-like ePDEs. The SRJ methodology relies on computing the appropriate
parameters of a multilevel approach with the goal of minimizing the number of
iterations needed to cut down the residuals below specified tolerances. The
efficiency in the reduction of the residual increases with the number of levels
employed in the algorithm. Applying the original methodology to compute the
algorithm parameters with more than 5 levels notably hinders obtaining optimal
SRJ schemes, as the mixed (non-linear) algebraic-differential equations from
which they result become notably stiff. Here we present a new methodology for
obtaining the parameters of SRJ schemes that overcomes the limitations of the
original algorithm and provide parameters for SRJ schemes with up to 15 levels
and resolutions of up to $2^{15}$ points per dimension, allowing for
acceleration factors larger than several hundreds with respect to the Jacobi
method for typical resolutions and, in some high resolution cases, close to
1000. Furthermore, we extend the original algorithm to apply it to certain
systems of non-linear ePDEs.

dependent on detail-rich data. Eye-trackers promise to provide respective data,
but the associated costs are often beyond the researchers' budget. Recently,
eye-trackers have entered the market that promise eye-tracking support at a
reasonable price. In this work, we explore whether such eye-trackers are of use
for information systems research and explore the accuracy of a low-cost
eye-tracker (Gazepoint GP3) in an empirical study. The results show that
Gazepoint GP3 is well suited for respective research, given that experimental
material acknowledges the limits of the eye-tracker. To foster replication and
comparison of results, all data, experimental material as well as the source
code developed for this study are made available online.

viscous-resistive accretion flow with large scale magnetic fields that have odd
symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane in $B_\theta$, and even symmetry
in $B_r$ and $B_\phi$. Following previous authors, we also assume that the
polar velocity $v_\theta$ is nonzero. We focus on four parameters:
$\beta_{r0}$, $\beta_{\phi0}$ (the plasma beta parameters for associated with
magnetic field components at the equatorial plane), the magnetic resistivity
$\eta_0$, and the density index $n=-d\ln\rho/d\ln r$. The resulting flow
solutions are divided into two parts consisting of an inflow region with a
negative radial velocity ($v_r<0$) and an outflow region with $v_r>0$. Our
results show that stronger outflows emerge for smaller $\beta_{r0}$
($\le10^{-2}$ for $n>1$) and larger values of $\beta_{\phi0}$, $\eta_0$ and
$n$.

In
particular the acquisition process is analyzed in great detail. Acquision is
most conventiently described by a number of frequency and time parameters such
as lock-in range, lock-in time, pull-in range, pull-in time, and hold-in range.
While for the classical PLL equations for all these parameters have been
derived (many of them are approximations, some even crude approximations), this
has not yet been carried out for the Costas loop. It is the aim of this
analysis to close this gap. The paper starts with an overview on mathematical
and physical models (exact and simplified) of the different variants of the
Costas loop, cf. Section~1. In Sections 2--5 equations for the above mentioned
key parameters are derived. Finally, the hold-in range of the Costas loop for
the case where a lead-lag filter is used for the loop filter is analyzed, cf.
Appendix.

are considered. The role of right and left invertible interaction operators
occurring in these equations together with their interpretation is discussed.
Some comments on approximations to the proposed equations are given. The
importance of positivity conditions and a possible interpretation of n-pi in
the case of their non-compliance, for essentially non-linear interactions
(ENI), are proposed. A language of creation, annihilation and projection
operators which can be applied in classical as well as in quantum case is used.
The role of the complex numbers and functions in physics is also a little
elucidated.
