  Algorithms","35 pages, 4 figures",,,,"math.OC cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the context of sparse recovery, it is known that most of existing
regularizers such as $\ell_1$ suffer from some bias incurred by some leading
entries (in magnitude) of the associated vector. To neutralize this bias, we
propose a class of models with partial regularizers for recovering a sparse
solution of a linear system. We show that every local minimizer of these models
is sufficiently sparse or the magnitude of all its nonzero entries is above a
uniform constant depending only on the data of the linear system. Moreover, for
a class of partial regularizers, any global minimizer of these models is a
sparsest solution to the linear system. We also establish some sufficient
conditions for local or global recovery of the sparsest solution to the linear
system, among which one of the conditions is weaker than the best known
restricted isometry property (RIP) condition for sparse recovery by $\ell_1$.
In addition, a first-order feasible augmented Lagrangian (FAL) method is
proposed for solving these models, in which each subproblem is solved by a
nonmonotone proximal gradient (NPG) method. Despite the complication of the
partial regularizers, we show that each proximal subproblem in NPG can be
solved as a certain number of one-dimensional optimization problems, which
usually have a closed-form solution. We also show that any accumulation point
of the sequence generated by FAL is a first-order stationary point of the
models. Numerical results on compressed sensing and sparse logistic regression
demonstrate that the proposed models substantially outperform the widely used
ones in the literature in terms of solution quality.

in cycle 24 is fundamentally different from that in cycle 23. The annual

magnetic fields and umbral intensity agrees with past studies in that the
umbral intensity decreases as the field strength increases. This apparent
contradiction can be explained by the range of magnetic field values measured

For
this we scrutinise col- lective many-atom motions during all-atom molecular
dynamics simulations. We introduce, develop and employ various topological
techniques, in combination with analytic tools that we deduce from the concept
of integrable models and structure of discrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation.
The example we consider is an alpha-helical subunit of the HIV envelope
glycoprotein gp41. The helical structure is stable when the subunit is part of
the biological oligomer. But in isolation the helix becomes unstable, and the
monomer starts deforming. We follow the process computationally. We interpret
the evolving structure both in terms of a backbone based Heisenberg spin chain
and in terms of a side chain based XY spin chain. We find that in both cases
the formation of protein super-secondary structure is akin the formation of a
topological Bloch domain wall along a spin chain. During the process we
identify three individual Bloch walls and we show that each of them can be
modelled with a very high precision in terms of a soliton solution to a
discrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation.

$6\%-14\%$, including the Poisson statistical fluctuation of faint flares below

Due to the difficult task to measure experimentally TF behaviours, and the

usually incur in costly procedures, and they present problems to describe

spectrum and mixing matrices could fit accurately using the latitude introduced
by inclusion of quantum corrections to the GUT-effective MSSM-SM matching
conditions. The fits yield predictions about the nature of the sparticle
spectrum on the basis of the required threshold corrections. This indicated a
necessarily large value for $A_0$ in 2008 : well before Higgs discovery at 126
GeV made it a commonplace assumption. GUT scale threshold corrections to the
normalization of the emergent effective MSSM Higgs ameliorate the long standing
Susy GUT puzzle of fast dimension five operator mediated proton decay.
Numerical investigation indicates that B-violation rates below or near the
current experimental upper limits are feasible in fully realistic models. Our
results imply that UV completion models with large numbers of fields, like
Kaluza-Klein models or String Theory, must be able to compute threshold
corrections to be considered quantitative theories and not just fables.
Required improvements in the fitting procedure are discussed. A generalization
of the NMSGUT by gauging the flavour symmetry of the kinetic terms,while
retaining renormalizability and the successful MSGUT symmetry breaking
patterns, may allow dynamical generation of the observed Yukawa structure of
the MSSM via the spontaneous breaking of the full gauge symmetry down to the
MSSM at the unification scale. Focus on the emergence of the MSSM Higgs from
the multiple Higgs doublets in the GUT thus provides a crucial window to view
the energetically remote UV dynamics specified in fully calculable and
realistic MSGUTs.

from the GCLASS and GEEC2 spectroscopic surveys. We compute a ""conversion
fraction"" $f_{\rm convert}$ that represents the fraction of galaxies that were
prematurely quenched by their environment. For massive galaxies, $M_{\rm
star}>10^{10.3}M_\odot$, we find $f_{\rm convert}\sim 0.4$ in the groups and
$\sim 0.6$ in the clusters, similar to comparable measurements at $z=0$. This
means the time between first accretion into a more massive halo and final star
formation quenching is $t_p\sim 2$ Gyr. This is substantially longer than the
estimated time required for a galaxy's star formation rate to become zero once
it starts to decline, suggesting there is a long delay time during which little
differential evolution occurs. In contrast with local observations we find
evidence that this delay timescale may depend on stellar mass, with $t_p$
approaching $t_{\rm Hubble}$ for $M_{\rm star}\sim 10^{9.5}M_\odot$. The result
suggests that the delay time must not only be much shorter than it is today,
but may also depend on stellar mass in a way that is not consistent with a
simple evolution in proportion to the dynamical time. Instead, we find the data
are well-matched by a model in which the decline in star formation is due to
""overconsumption"", the exhaustion of a gas reservoir through star formation and
expulsion via modest outflows in the absence of cosmological accretion.
Dynamical gas removal processes, which are likely dominant in quenching newly
accreted satellites today, may play only a secondary role at $z=1$.

(ABG) model, multi-frequency CI model, and multi-frequency CI model with a
frequency-weighted path loss exponent (CIF), in both line-of-sight and

good estimation and exhibit stable behavior over frequencies and distances,
with a solid physical basis and less computational complexity when compared
with the FI and ABG models. Furthermore, path loss in outdoor scenarios shows
little dependence on frequency beyond the first meter of free space
propagation, whereas path loss tends to increase with frequency in addition to
the increased free space path loss in indoor environments. Therefore, the CI
model is suitable for outdoor environments over multiple frequencies, while the
CIF model is more appropriate for indoor modeling. This work shows that both
the CI and CIF models use fewer parameters and offer more convenient closedform
expressions suitable for analysis, without compromising model accuracy when
compared to current 3GPP and WINNER path loss models.

adaptivity. MAS organization is the research area that is concerned with these
issues and it is currently a very active and interesting research area.
Designing a MAS with an initial organization and giving it the ability to
dynamically reorganize to adapt the dynamic changes of its unpredictable and
uncertain environment, is the feasible way to survive and to run effectively.
Normally, MAS organization is tackled by what is called, MAS organizational
models, which are concerned with the description (formally or informally) of
the structural and dynamical aspects of agent organizations. This paper
proposes a two-dimension space, called MOS-2, for positioning and assessing MAS
organizational models based on two dimensions: their adopted engineering
viewpoint (agent-centered or organization-centered) as the vertical dimension
and the agents awareness/unawareness of the existence of the organizational
level as the horizontal dimension. The MOS-2 space is applied for positioning a
number of familiar organizational models. Its future trends and possible
improvements are highlighted. They include the following, (1) adding Time as a
dimension, (2) increasing the considered dimensions, (3) providing a
quantitative approach for positioning MAS organizational models.

Dynamics Observatory. Propagating disturbances (PDs) are observed everywhere in
the polar off-limb regions of the Sun at coronal heights. From this

lower resolution spatial feature maps. On some tasks, such as whole-image
classification, max-pooling derived features are well suited; however, for
tasks requiring precise localization, such as pixel level prediction and
segmentation, max-pooling destroys exactly the information required to perform
well. Precise localization may be preserved by shallow convnets without pooling
but at the expense of robustness. Can we have our max-pooled multi-layered cake
and eat it too? Several papers have proposed summation and concatenation based
methods for combining upsampled coarse, abstract features with finer features
to produce robust pixel level predictions. Here we introduce another model ---
dubbed Recombinator Networks --- where coarse features inform finer features
early in their formation such that finer features can make use of several
layers of computation in deciding how to use coarse features. The model is
trained once, end-to-end and performs better than summation-based
architectures, reducing the error from the previous state of the art on two
facial keypoint datasets, AFW and AFLW, by 30\% and beating the current
state-of-the-art on 300W without using extra data. We improve performance even
further by adding a denoising prediction model based on a novel convnet
formulation.

  Search",,,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new variant of the nearest neighbor search problem, which
allows for some coordinates of the dataset to be arbitrarily corrupted or
unknown. Formally, given a dataset of $n$ points $P=\{ x_1,\ldots, x_n\}$ in
high-dimensions, and a parameter $k$, the goal is to preprocess the dataset,
such that given a query point $q$, one can compute quickly a point $x \in P$,
such that the distance of the query to the point $x$ is minimized, when
ignoring the ""optimal"" $k$ coordinates. Note, that the coordinates being
ignored are a function of both the query point and the point returned.
  We present a general reduction from this problem to answering ANN queries,
which is similar in spirit to LSH (locality sensitive hashing) [IM98].
Specifically, we give a sampling technique which achieves a bi-criterion
approximation for this problem. If the distance to the nearest neighbor after
ignoring $k$ coordinates is $r$, the data-structure returns a point that is
within a distance of $O(r)$ after ignoring $O(k)$ coordinates. We also present
other applications and further extensions and refinements of the above result.
  The new data-structures are simple and (arguably) elegant, and should be
practical -- specifically, all bounds are polynomial in all relevant parameters
(including the dimension of the space, and the robustness parameter $k$).

The second formulation replaces the 0-1 classification error with the Hamming

classifies a sample. Based on this second formulation, block coordinate descent
and alternating minimization algorithms are developed. Experiments show that
the two-level rules can yield noticeably better performance than one-level

the other two-level rule learning methods in our comparison. A proposed

from above ($z=\infty$). This is relevant to the question of whether waves
excited by flares in the solar atmosphere can penetrate the Alfv\'en/acoustic
equipartition layer (which we identify as the canopy) to reach the photosphere
with sufficient energy to create sunquakes. It is found that slow waves above
the acoustic cutoff frequency efficiently penetrate (transmit) as acoustic
(fast) waves if directed at a small attack angle to the magnetic field, with
the rest converting to magnetic (slow) waves, in accord with Generalized Ray
Theory. This may help explain the compact nature of seismic sources of
sunquakes identified using seismic holography. The incident slow waves can also
efficiently transmit at low frequency in inclined field due to the reduction in
acoustic cutoff frequency (ramp effect). Incident fast (magnetic) ""waves"" from
infinity with specified nonzero horizontal wavenumber are necessarily
evanescent, but can carry energy to the equipartition level by tunnelling. It
is found that this can then efficiently convert to acoustic (fast) energy that
can again reach the photosphere as a travelling wave. Overall, there appear to
be ample avenues for substantial compressive wave energy to penetrate the
canopy and impact the photosphere.

learning latent structure both from noisy observations and from the temporal
ordering in the data, where it is assumed that meaningful correlation structure
exists across time. A few highly-structured models, such as the linear
dynamical system with linear-Gaussian observations, have closed-form inference
procedures (e.g. the Kalman Filter), but this case is an exception to the
general rule that exact posterior inference in more complex generative models
is intractable. Consequently, much work in time-series modeling focuses on
approximate inference procedures for one particular class of models. Here, we
extend recent developments in stochastic variational inference to develop a
`black-box' approximate inference technique for latent variable models with
latent dynamical structure. We propose a structured Gaussian variational
approximate posterior that carries the same intuition as the standard Kalman
filter-smoother but, importantly, permits us to use the same inference approach
to approximate the posterior of much more general, nonlinear latent variable
generative models. We show that our approach recovers accurate estimates in the

performs well in comparison to variational approaches that were designed in a
bespoke fashion for specific non-conjugate models.

massless fermions for weak coupling and a massive fermions and strong coupling,
where a fermion condensate is formed. In the original NJL model the coupling
constant g is indeed constant, and in this work we consider a modified version
of the NJL model by introducing a dynamical field dependent coupling motivated
by string theory. The effective potential as a function of the varying coupling
(aimed to implement a natural phase transition) is seen to develop a negative
divergence, i.e. becomes a ""bottomless well"" in certain limit region. Although
we explain how an lower unbounded potential is not necessarily unacceptable in
a cosmological context, the divergence can be removed if we consider a mass
term for the coupling-like field. We found that for a proper set of parameters,
the total potential obtained has two minima, one located at the origin (the
trivial solution, in which the fluid associated with the fields behave like
matter); and the other related to the non-trivial solution. This last solution
has three possibilities: 1) if the minimum is positive V_{min}>0, the system
behave as a cosmological constant, thus leading eventually to an accelerated
universe; 2) if the minimized potential vanishes V_{min}=0, then we have matter
with no acceleration ; 3) finally a negative minimum V_{min}<0 leads an
eventually collapsing universe, even though we have a flat geometry.Therefore,
a possible interpretation as Dark Matter or Dark Energy is allowed among the

scale in the clustering of galaxies, QSOs and inter-galactic gas. This scale
can be used as a standard ruler to map the expansion history of the Universe, a
technique known as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). BAO offer a
high-precision, low-systematics means of constraining our cosmological model.
The statistical power of BAO measurements can be improved if the `smearing' of
the acoustic feature by non-linear structure formation is undone in a process
known as reconstruction. In this paper we use low-order Lagrangian perturbation
theory to study the ability of $21\,$cm experiments to perform reconstruction
and how augmenting these surveys with galaxy redshift surveys at relatively low
number densities can improve performance. We find that the critical number
density which must be achieved in order to benefit $21\,$cm surveys is set by
the linear theory power spectrum near its peak, and corresponds to densities
achievable by upcoming surveys of emission line galaxies such as eBOSS and
DESI. As part of this work we analyze reconstruction within the framework of
Lagrangian perturbation theory with local Lagrangian bias, redshift-space
distortions, ${\bf k}$-dependent noise and anisotropic filtering schemes.

effect in gravitational radiation reaction, which enters at 4PN order in the
dynamics of a binary system. The computation entails a subtle interplay between
the near (or potential) and far (or radiation) zones. In particular, we find
that the tail contribution to the effective action is non-local in time, and
features both a dissipative and a `conservative' term. The latter includes a
logarithmic ultraviolet (UV) divergence, which we show cancels against an
infrared (IR) singularity found in the (conservative) near zone. The origin of
this behavior in the long-distance EFT is due to the point-particle limit
-shrinking the binary to a point- which transforms a would-be infrared
singularity into an ultraviolet divergence. This is a common occurrence in an
EFT approach, which furthermore allows us to use renormalization group (RG)
techniques to resum the resulting logarithmic contributions. We then derive the
RG evolution for the binding potential and total mass/energy, and find
agreement with the results obtained imposing the conservation of the (pseudo)
stress-energy tensor in the radiation theory. While the calculation of the
leading tail contribution to the effective action involves only one diagram,
five are needed for the one-point function. This suggests logarithmic
corrections may be easier to incorporate in this fashion. We conclude with a
few remarks on the nature of these IR/UV singularities, the (lack of)
ambiguities recently discussed in the literature, and the completeness of the
analytic Post-Newtonian framework.

Therefore, both planets could have had a similar formation pathway, with the

spin-unpolarized quasiparticles into a Zeeman-split superconductor gives rise
to a spin imbalance. The relaxation length of such a spin signal is determined
by the energy relaxation length and can be extremely large as compared to the
relaxation length of spin-polarized quasiparticles. There can exist two types
of signals: due to nonthermalized quasiparticle distribution and due to
thermalized overheated electron distribution. They have different decay lengths
and can be distinguished by their different dependencies on the applied
voltage. The decay length of the nonthermalized signal is determined by the
electron-electron scattering rate, renormalized due to superconductivity. The
decay length of the thermalized signal is determined by the length on which
energy leaves the electronic subsystem and can be very large under special
conditions. Applications of the theory to recent experimental data on spin
relaxation in Zeeman-split and exchange-split superconductors are discussed. In
particular, it can explain the extremely high spin relaxation lengths,
experimentally observed in Zeeman-split superconductors, and their growth with

of several components giving rise to the observed spectral shape. Here we
examine a sample of the 8 brightest, single pulsed {\it Fermi} bursts whose

Five of these bursts require an additional photospheric component (blackbody).
In particular, we investigate the inferred properties of the jet and the
physical requirements set by the observed components for these five bursts, in
the context of a baryonic dominated outflow, motivated by the strong
photospheric component. We find similar jet properties for all five bursts: the
bulk Lorentz factor decreases monotonously over the pulses and lies between
1000 and 100. This evolution is robust and can neither be explained by a
varying radiative efficiency nor a varying magnetisation of the jet assuming
the photosphere radius is above the coasting radius. Such a behaviour
challenges several dissipation mechanisms, e.g., the internal shocks.
Furthermore, in all 8 cases the data clearly reject a fast-cooled synchrotron
spectrum (in which a significant fraction of the emitting electrons have cooled
to energies below the minimum injection energy), inferring a typical electron
Lorentz factor of $10^4 - 10^7$. Such values are much higher than what is
typically expected in internal shocks. Therefore, while the synchrotron
scenario is not rejected by the data, the interpretation does present several
limitations that need to be addressed. Finally, we point out and discuss
alternative interpretations.

and NGC 300 2008OT-1, the prototypes of a common class of stellar transients
whose true nature is debated. Both objects are still fading and are now >15
times fainter than the progenitors in the mid-IR and are undetected in the
optical and near-IR. Data from the Large Binocular Telescope and Magellan show
that neither source has been variable in the optical since fading in 2010. We
present models of surviving sources obscured by dusty shells or winds and find
that extreme dust models are needed for surviving stars to be successfully
hidden by dust. Explaining these transients as supernovae explosions, such as
the electron capture supernovae believed to be associated with extreme AGB
stars, seems an equally viable solution. Though SN 2008S is not detected in
Chandra X-Ray Observatory data taken in 2012, the flux limits allow the fading
IR source to be powered solely by the shock interaction of ejecta with the
circumstellar medium if the shock velocity at the time of the observation was
>20% slower than estimated from emission line widths while the transient was
still optically bright. Continued SST monitoring and 10-20 micron observations
with JWST can resolve any remaining ambiguities.

Finite element method simulations of the phonon dispersion relation and

uses techniques developed to describe the extremes of branching random walks

to $\delta_{\phi_c}\Delta\delta_{\phi_c}$ and $\int V(\phi_c)$, respectively,
with $\phi_c=\int J\Delta$ and $\Delta$ the Feynman propagator. Comparing the

We then derive a new representation of the generating functional

leading to a factorization of the counterterms of the interaction. We
investigate the structure of the functional generator for normal ordered
potentials and derive an infinite set of relations in the case of the potential

Auto-Context, ConvPP avoids the iterative steps of learning a series of
discriminative classifiers and automatically learns contextual configurations;

learns convolution in the labeling space with much improved modeling capability

ConvPP capitalizes on the rich representation power of convolution by
automatically learning priors built on convolutional filters. We accomplish our

It requires only information about the symmetries broken during the
inflationary era, and on the number and nature of fields that drive inflation.
In this paper, we consider the case for scenarios that simultaneously break
time reparameterization and spatial diffeomorphisms during inflation. We
examine how to analyse such systems using an effective field theory approach,
and we discuss several observational consequences for the statistics of scalar
and tensor modes. For example, examining the three point functions, we show
that this symmetry breaking pattern can lead to an enhanced amplitude for the
squeezed bispectra, and to a distinctive angular dependence between their three
wavevectors. We also discuss how our results indicate prospects for
constraining the level of spatial diffeomorphism breaking during inflation.

$\Gamma$ is a Dirichlet generating function that enumerates finite-index
subgroups whose profinite completion is isomorphic to that of $\Gamma$. Such
zeta functions can be expressed as Euler products of $p$-adic integrals over
the $p$-adic points of an algebraic automorphism group associated to $\Gamma$.
In this way they are closely related to classical zeta functions of algebraic
groups over local fields.
  We describe the algebraic automorphism groups for a natural family of
class-$2$ nilpotent groups; these groups can be viewed as generalizations of
$D^*$-groups of odd Hirsch length. General $D^*$-groups, that is
`indecomposable' finitely generated, torsion-free class-$2$ nilpotent groups
with central Hirsch length $2$, were classified up to commensurability by
Grunewald and Segal. We calculate the local pro-isomorphic zeta functions for
our groups and obtain, in particular, explicit formulae for the local
pro-isomorphic zeta functions associated to $D^*$-groups of odd Hirsch length.
From these we deduce local functional equations; for the global zeta functions
we describe the abscissae of convergence and find meromorphic continuations. We
deduce that the spectrum of abscissae of convergence for pro-isomorphic zeta
functions of class-2 nilpotent groups contains infinitely many cluster points.
For instance, the global abscissae of convergence of the pro-isomorphic zeta
functions of $D^*$-groups of odd Hirsch length are determined and yield the
cluster point $6$.

scientific endeavors. Its most popular formulation, introduced by Fisher, uses
$n$ samples to predict the number $U$ of hitherto unseen species that would be
observed if $t\cdot n$ new samples were collected. Of considerable interest is
the largest ratio $t$ between the number of new and existing samples for which
$U$ can be accurately predicted.
  In seminal works, Good and Toulmin constructed an intriguing estimator that
predicts $U$ for all $t\le 1$, thereby showing that the number of species can
be estimated for a population twice as large as that observed. Subsequently
Efron and Thisted obtained a modified estimator that empirically predicts $U$
even for some $t>1$, but without provable guarantees.
  We derive a class of estimators that $\textit{provably}$ predict $U$ not just
for constant $t>1$, but all the way up to $t$ proportional to $\log n$. This
shows that the number of species can be estimated for a population $\log n$
times larger than that observed, a factor that grows arbitrarily large as $n$
increases. We also show that this range is the best possible and that the
estimators' mean-square error is optimal up to constants for any $t$. Our
approach yields the first provable guarantee for the Efron-Thisted estimator
and, in addition, a variant which achieves stronger theoretical and
experimental performance than existing methodologies on a variety of synthetic
and real datasets.
  The estimators we derive are simple linear estimators that are computable in
time proportional to $n$. The performance guarantees hold uniformly for all
distributions, and apply to all four standard sampling models commonly used
across various scientific disciplines: multinomial, Poisson, hypergeometric,
and Bernoulli product.

later types having significantly higher UV heating fractions. We find a strong

the [CII] line is significantly redshifted by ~1700 km/s with respect to the

an extreme outlier. Through modeling we can rule out a flat rotation curve for

a key role in the dynamical evolution of \emph{single} intermediate-mass

Here, we explore the effects of GDF on the evolution of \emph{binary}
planetesimals embedded in a gaseous disk using an N-body code with a fiducial
external force accounting for GDF. We find that GDF can induce binary mergers
on timescales shorter than the disk lifetime for masses above
$m_{p}\gtrsim10^{22}g$ at 1AU, independent of the binary initial separation and
eccentricity. Such mergers can affect the structure of merger-formed
planetesimals, and the GDF-induced binary inspiral can play a role in the
evolution of the planetesimal disk. In addition, binaries on eccentric orbits
around the star may evolve in the supersonic regime, where the torque reverses
and the binary expands, which would enhance the cross section for planetesimal
encounters with the binary. Highly inclined binaries with small mass ratios,
evolve due to the combined effects of Kozai-Lidov cycles with GDF which lead to
chaotic evolution. Prograde binaries go through semi-regular Kozai-Lidov
evolution, while retrograde binaries frequently flip their inclination and
$\sim50\%$ of them are destroyed.

While most previous studies have used galaxy samples that were overwhelmingly
dominated by high-mass, early-type galaxies, our sample includes 17 spiral
galaxies, half of which have $M_{BH} < 10^7~M_\odot$, and allows us to better
investigate the poorly studied low-mass end of the $M_{BH} - M_{*,sph}$

the bulges of late-type galaxies define a much steeper blue sequence, with
$M_{BH} \propto M_{*,sph}^{2-3}$, indicating that gas-rich processes feed the
black hole more efficiently than the host bulge as they coevolve. We
additionally report that: i) our Sersic galaxy sample follows a less steep

by some to be pseudo-bulges, are not offset to lower $M_{BH}$ from the
correlation defined by the current bulge sample with $n>2$; and iii) $L_{sph}$

metallicity, -3.0 < [Fe/H] < 1 dex. The mean of the Metallicity Distribution
Function (MDF) decreases as a function of height z from the plane and, more
weakly, with galactic radius. The most metal rich stars in the inner Galaxy are
concentrated to the plane and the more metal poor stars are found predominantly
further from the plane, with an overall vertical gradient in the mean of the
MDF of about -0.45 dex/kpc. This vertical gradient is believed to reflect the
changing contribution with height of different populations in the inner-most
region of the Galaxy. The more metal rich stars of the bulge are part of the
boxy/peanut structure and comprise stars in orbits which trace out the
underlying X-shape. There is still a lack of consensus on the origin of the
metal poor stars ([Fe/H] < -0.5) in the region of the bulge. Some studies
attribute the more metal poor stars of the bulge to the thick disk and stellar

metal poor stars are a distinct ""old spheroid"" bulge population. Understanding
the origin of the populations that make up the MDF of the bulge, and
identifying if there is a unique bulge population which has formed separately

two-moment method with an analytic closure (so-called M1 transport) for the
neutrino transport. This transport is multienergy, multispecies,
velocity-dependent and truly multidimensional, i.e., we do not assume the
commonly used ""ray-by-ray"" approximation. Our GR gravity is implemented in our
Newtonian hydrodynamics simulations via an effective relativistic potential
(GREP) that closely reproduces the GR structure of neutron stars and has been
shown to match GR simulations of core collapse quite well. In axisymmetry, we
simulate core-collapse supernovae with four different progenitor models in both
Newtonian and GR gravity. We find that the more compact protoneutron star
structure realized in simulations with GR gravity gives higher neutrino
luminosities and higher neutrino energies. These differences in turn give
higher neutrino heating rates (upwards of $\sim$20-30% over the corresponding
Newtonian gravity simulations) that increase the efficacy of the neutrino
mechanism. Three of the four models successfully explode in the simulations
assuming GREP gravity. In our Newtonian gravity simulations, two of the four
models explode, but at times much later than observed in our GR gravity
simulations. Our results, both in Newtonian and GR gravity, compare well with
several other studies in the literature. These results conclusively show that
the approximation of Newtonian gravity for simulating the core-collapse
supernova central engine is not acceptable. We also simulate four additional

Rich commensurate structures also emerge, at certain filling fractions, in high

concerns the character of these and other electronic systems at irrational
filling fractions. Here we demonstrate that quasicrystalline structures
naturally emerge in these situations, and trigger behaviors not typically

existence of quantum Hall plateaux. We then study analogous physical situations
in a system of cold Rydberg atoms placed on an optical lattice. Such an

detect the emergent quasicrystals we predict. We discuss similar situations in

comparing the 21-cm visibility signal with the system noise appropriate for a

1000 hours. The exact value of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) will depend on
the source properties, in particular on the mass and age of the source and the
escape fraction of ionizing photons. The predicted SNR decreases with
increasing redshift. We provide simple scaling laws to estimate the SNR for
different values of the parameters which characterize the source and the

their numerous desirable properties, such as water repellency and interfacial
slip. Superhydrophobicity stems from an aversion for water to wet the surface
texture, so that a water droplet in the superhydrophobic ""Cassie state"",
contacts only the tips of the rough hydrophobic surface. However,
superhydrophobicity is remarkably fragile, and can break down due to the
wetting of the surface texture to yield the ""Wenzel state"" under various
conditions, such as elevated pressures or droplet impact. Moreover, due to
large energetic barriers that impede the reverse (dewetting) transition, this
breakdown in superhydrophobicity is widely believed to be irreversible. Using
molecular simulations in conjunction with enhanced sampling techniques, here we
show that on surfaces with nanoscale texture, water density fluctuations can
lead to a reduction in the free energetic barriers to dewetting by
circumventing the classical dewetting pathways. In particular, the
fluctuation-mediated dewetting pathway involves a number of transitions between
distinct dewetted morphologies, with each transition lowering the resistance to
dewetting. Importantly, an understanding of the mechanistic pathways to
dewetting and their dependence on pressure, allows us to augment the surface
texture design, so that the barriers to dewetting are eliminated altogether and
the Wenzel state becomes unstable at ambient conditions. Such robust surfaces,
which defy classical expectations and can spontaneously recover their
superhydrophobicity, could have widespread importance, from underwater
operation to phase change heat transfer applications.

into solar system architecture and planet demographics. While nearly 1900
exoplanets have now been discovered and confirmed, none are still in the
process of formation. Transition discs, protoplanetary disks with inner
clearings best explained by the influence of accreting planets, are natural
laboratories for the study of planet formation. Some transition discs show
evidence for the presence of young planets in the form of disc asymmetries or
infrared sources detected within their clearings, as in the case of LkCa 15.
Attempts to observe directly signatures of accretion onto protoplanets have
hitherto proven unsuccessful. Here we report adaptive optics observations of
LkCa 15 that probe within the disc clearing. With accurate source positions
over multiple epochs spanning 2009 - 2015, we infer the presence of multiple
companions on Keplerian orbits. We directly detect H{\alpha} emission from the
innermost companion, LkCa 15 b, evincing hot (~10,000 K) gas falling deep into
the potential well of an accreting protoplanet.

algebra. We also consider the noncircular generalization of this Ansatz and
show how the noncircular contributions on the one hand break the conformal
invariance and on the other hand enhance the standard translations symmetries
of the circular Killing vectors to supertranslations depending on the direction
along which the circularity is lost. As another application of the method, the
well-known relation defining conjugate gravitational potentials introduced by
Chandrasekhar, that makes possible the derivation of the Kerr black hole from a
trivial solution of the Ernst equations, is deduced as a special point of the
general residual symmetry of the Papapetrou Ansatz. We emphasize how the
election of Weyl coordinates, which determines the Papapetrou Ansatz, breaks
also the conformal freedom of the stationary axisymmetric spacetimes.
Additionally, we study AdS waves for any dimension generalizing the residual
symmetries already known for lower dimensions and exhibiting a very complex
infinite-dimensional Lie algebra containing three families: two of them span
the semidirect sum of the Witt algebra and scalar supertranslations and the
third generates vector supertranslations. We manage to comprehend that the

precision on M0-M9 spectra covering the ZYJHK bands. We do so while considering
both a perfect atmospheric transmission correction and discarding areas
polluted by deep telluric features, as done in previous works.
  Methods: To simulate the M-dwarf spectra, PHOENIX-ACES model spectra were
employed; they were convolved with rotational kernels and instrumental profiles
to reproduce stars with a $v.sin{i}$ of 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 km/s when observed
at resolutions of 60 000, 80 000, and 100 000. We considered the RV precision
as calculated on the whole spectra, after discarding strongly polluted areas,
and after applying a perfect telluric correction. In our simulations we paid
particular attention to the details of the convolution and sampling of the
spectra, and we discuss their impact on the final spectra.
  Results: Our simulations show that the most important parameter ruling the
difference in attainable precision between the considered bands is the spectral
type. For M0-M3 stars, the bands that deliver the most precise RV measurements
are the Z, Y, and H band, with relative merits depending on the parameters of
the simulation. For M6-M9 stars, the bands show a difference in precision that
is within a factor of $\sim$2 and does not clearly depend on the band; this
difference is reduced to a factor smaller than $\sim$1.5 if we consider a
non-rotating star seen at high resolution. We also show that an M6-M9 spectrum
will deliver a precision about two times better as an M0-M3 spectra with the
same signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we note that the details of modelling the
Earth atmosphere and interpreting the results have a significant impact on
which wavelength regions are discarded when setting a limit threshold at 2-3%.

for learning the value functions of stationary policies in a discounted, finite
state and action Markov decision process. The ETD($\lambda$) algorithm was
recently proposed by Sutton, Mahmood, and White to solve a long-standing
divergence problem of the standard TD algorithm when it is applied to
off-policy training, where data from an exploratory policy are used to evaluate
other policies of interest. The almost sure convergence of ETD($\lambda$) has
been proved in our recent work under general off-policy training conditions,
but for a narrow range of diminishing stepsize. In this paper we present
convergence results for constrained versions of ETD($\lambda$) with constant
stepsize and with diminishing stepsize from a broad range. Our results
characterize the asymptotic behavior of the trajectory of iterates produced by
those algorithms, and are derived by combining key properties of ETD($\lambda$)
with powerful convergence theorems from the weak convergence methods in
stochastic approximation theory. For the case of constant stepsize, in addition
to analyzing the behavior of the algorithms in the limit as the stepsize
parameter approaches zero, we also analyze their behavior for a fixed stepsize
and bound the deviations of their averaged iterates from the desired solution.
These results are obtained by exploiting the weak Feller property of the Markov
chains associated with the algorithms, and by using ergodic theorems for weak
Feller Markov chains, in conjunction with the convergence results we get from
the weak convergence methods. Besides ETD($\lambda$), our analysis also applies
to the off-policy TD($\lambda$) algorithm, when the divergence issue is avoided
by setting $\lambda$ sufficiently large.

methods (WH) in the \texttt{MERCURY} software package, the \texttt{MERCURY}
switching integrator, and others and find HB15 to be the most efficient method
or tied for the most efficient method in many cases. Unlike WH, HB15 solved
$N$-body problems exhibiting close encounters with small, acceptable error,
although frequent encounters slowed the code. Switching maps like
\texttt{MERCURY} change between two methods and are not exactly symplectic. We
carry out careful tests on their properties and suggest they must be used with
caution. We then use different integrators to solve a 3-body problem consisting
of a binary planet orbiting a star. For all tested tolerances and time steps,
\texttt{MERCURY} unbinds the binary after 0 to 25 years. However, in the
solutions of HB15, a time-symmetric Hermite code, and a symplectic Yoshida
method, the binary remains bound for $>1000$ years. The methods' solutions are
qualitatively different, despite small errors in the first integrals in most
cases. Several checks suggest the qualitative binary behavior of HB15's
solution is correct. The Bulirsch-Stoer and Radau methods in the
\texttt{MERCURY} package also unbind the binary before a time of 50 years,
suggesting this dynamical error is due to a \texttt{MERCURY} bug.

three events, including the Oct 8, 2009 airburst near Sulawesi, Indonesia,

strong monolithic stones or iron meteoroids. Based on orbital similarity, we
find a probable connection among several events in our population with the
Taurid meteoroid complex; no other major meteoroid streams show probable
linkages to the orbits of our meter-scale population. Our impactors cover
almost four orders of magnitude in mass, but no trend in height of peak

separating a vacuum from an inviscid incompressible fluid, subject to the
self-gravitational force and neglecting surface tension, in two space
dimensions. The fluid is additionally assumed to be irrotational, and we proved
that for data which are size $\epsilon$ perturbations of an equilibrium state,
the lifespan $T$ of solutions satisfies $T \gtrsim \epsilon^{-2}$. The key to
the proof is to find a nonlinear transformation of the unknown function and a
coordinate change, such that the equation for the new unknown in the new
coordinate system has no quadratic nonlinear terms. For the related
irrotational gravity water wave equation with constant gravity the analogous
transformation was carried out by the last author in [3]. While our approach is
inspired by the last author's work [3], the self-gravity in the present problem
is a new nonlinearity which needs separate investigation. Upon completing [1]
we learned of the work of Ifrim and Tataru [2] where the gravity water wave
equation with constant gravity and constant vorticity is studied and a similar
estimate on the lifespan of the solution is obtained. In this short note we
demonstrate that our transformations in [1] can be easily modified to allow for
nonzero constant vorticity, and a similar energy method as in [1] gives an
estimate $T\gtrsim\epsilon^{-2}$ for the lifespan $T$ of solutions with data
which are size $\epsilon$ perturbations of the equilibrium. In particular, the
effect of the constant vorticity is an extra linear term with constant
coefficient in the transformed equation, which can be further transformed away
by a bounded linear transformation. This note serves as an appendix to the
aforementioned work of the authors.

abreast of the latest updates. The use of social media in such situations comes
with the caveat that new information being released piecemeal may encourage
rumours, many of which remain unverified long after their point of release.
Little is known, however, about the dynamics of the life cycle of a social
media rumour. In this paper we present a methodology that has enabled us to
collect, identify and annotate a dataset of 330 rumour threads (4,842 tweets)
associated with 9 newsworthy events. We analyse this dataset to understand how
users spread, support, or deny rumours that are later proven true or false, by
distinguishing two levels of status in a rumour life cycle i.e., before and
after its veracity status is resolved. The identification of rumours associated
with each event, as well as the tweet that resolved each rumour as true or
false, was performed by a team of journalists who tracked the events in real
time. Our study shows that rumours that are ultimately proven true tend to be
resolved faster than those that turn out to be false. Whilst one can readily
see users denying rumours once they have been debunked, users appear to be less
capable of distinguishing true from false rumours when their veracity remains
in question. In fact, we show that the prevalent tendency for users is to
support every unverified rumour. We also analyse the role of different types of
users, finding that highly reputable users such as news organisations endeavour
to post well-grounded statements, which appear to be certain and accompanied by
evidence. Nevertheless, these often prove to be unverified pieces of
information that give rise to false rumours. Our study reinforces the need for
developing robust machine learning techniques that can provide assistance for
assessing the veracity of rumours.

that diffusion in the cold and nearly neutral primordial gas at the end of the
Dark Ages could raise the abundance of primordial elements relative to hydrogen
in the first virialized halos: helium enrichment could reach $\delta Y_p/Y_p
\sim 10^{-4}$ in the first star-forming minihalos of $ \sim 10^5-10^6
M_{\odot}$. A moderate (to ~ 100 K) preheating of the primordial gas at the
beginning of cosmic reionization could increase this effect to $\delta Y_p/Y_p
\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$ for $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ halos. Even stronger abundance
enhancements, $\delta Y_p/Y_p$ ~ a few $10^{-3}$, may arise at much later,
post-reionization epochs, z ~ 2, in protogroups of galaxies ($\sim 10^{13}
M_{\odot}$) as a result of accretion of warm-hot intergalactic medium with T ~
10^6 K. The diffusion-induced abundance changes discussed here are small but
comparable to the already achieved ~ 0.1 % precision of cosmological
predictions of the primordial He abundance. If direct helium abundance
measurements (in particular, in low-metallicity HII regions in dwarf galaxies)
achieve the same level of precision in the future, their comparison with the
BBN predictions may require consideration of the effects discussed here.

led to an expanding use of meta-models across engineering and sciences. The
efficiency of meta-modeling techniques relies on their ability to provide
statistically-equivalent analytical representations based on relatively few
evaluations of the original model. Polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) have
proven a powerful tool for developing meta-models in a wide range of
applications; the key idea thereof is to expand the model response onto a basis
made of multivariate polynomials obtained as tensor products of appropriate
univariate polynomials. The classical PCE approach nevertheless faces the
""curse of dimensionality"", namely the exponential increase of the basis size
with increasing input dimension. To address this limitation, the sparse PCE
technique has been proposed, in which the expansion is carried out on only a
few relevant basis terms that are automatically selected by a suitable
algorithm. An alternative for developing meta-models with polynomial functions
in high-dimensional problems is offered by the newly emerged low-rank
approximations (LRA) approach. By exploiting the tensor-product structure of
the multivariate basis, LRA can provide polynomial representations in highly
compressed formats. Through extensive numerical investigations, we herein first
shed light on issues relating to the construction of canonical LRA with a
particular greedy algorithm involving a sequential updating of the polynomial
coefficients along separate dimensions. Canonical LRA exhibit smaller errors
than sparse PCE in cases when the number of available model evaluations is
small with respect to the input dimension. By introducing the conditional
generalization error, we further demonstrate that canonical LRA tend to
outperform sparse PCE in the prediction of extreme model responses.

  Nucl. Phys. B",,"10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2016.09.017",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The octant of $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{CP}$ are the two major unknowns in
neutrino oscillation physics. The precise determination of octant and
$\delta_{CP}$ is interlinked through the octant-$\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy. In
this paper we study the proficiency of the DUNE experiment to determine these
parameters, in particular, the role played by the antineutrinos, the broadband
nature of the beam and the matter effect. For $P_{\mu e}$ and $P_{\bar{\mu}
\bar{e}}$ the octant-$\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy occurs at different values of
$\delta_{CP}$, combination of neutrino and antineutrino runs help to resolve
this. However, in regions where neutrinos do not have octant degeneracy adding
antineutrino data is expected to decrease the sensitivity because of the
degeneracy and reduced statistics. However we find that in case of DUNE
baseline, the antineutrino runs help even in parameter space where the
antineutrino probabilities suffer from degeneracies. We explore this point in
detail and point out that this happens because of the (i) broad-band nature of
the beam so that even if there is degeneracy at a particular energy bin, over
the whole spectrum the degeneracy may not be there; (ii) the enhanced matter
effect due to the comparatively longer baseline which creates an increased
tension between the neutrino and the antineutrino probabilities which raises
the overall $\chi^2$ in case of combined runs. This feature is more prominent
for IH since the antineutrino probabilities in this case are much higher than
the neutrino probabilities due to matter effects. The main role of
antineutrinos in enhancing CP sensitivity is their ability to remove the
octant-$\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy. However even if one assumes octant to be known
the addition of antineutrinos can give enhanced CP sensitivity in some
parameter regions due to the tension between the neutrino and antineutrino
$\chi^2$s.

Yu, Trevor Darrell","Constrained Structured Regression with Convolutional Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as the dominant
model in computer vision. If provided with enough training data, they predict
almost any visual quantity. In a discrete setting, such as classification, CNNs
are not only able to predict a label but often predict a confidence in the form
of a probability distribution over the output space. In continuous regression
tasks, such a probability estimate is often lacking. We present a regression
framework which models the output distribution of neural networks. This output
distribution allows us to infer the most likely labeling following a set of
physical or modeling constraints. These constraints capture the intricate
interplay between different input and output variables, and complement the
output of a CNN. However, they may not hold everywhere. Our setup further
allows to learn a confidence with which a constraint holds, in the form of a
distribution of the constrain satisfaction. We evaluate our approach on the
problem of intrinsic image decomposition, and show that constrained structured
regression significantly increases the state-of-the-art.

dynamics of a time-delayed predator-prey system with modified Leslie-Gower and
Beddington-DeAngelis type functional responses for large initial data. In
\cite{RK15}, we have seen that the model does possess globally bounded

Here, we show that actually solutions to this model system can blow-up in
finite time, for large initial condition, \emph{even} under the parametric
restrictions derived in \cite{RK15}. We prove blow-up in the delayed model, as
well as the non delayed model, providing sufficient conditions on the largeness
of data, required for finite time blow-up. Numerical simulations show, that
actually the initial data does not have to be very large, to induce blow-up.
The spatially explicit system is seen to possess Turing instability. We have
also studied Hopf-bifurcation direction in the spatial system, as well as
stability of the spatial Hopf-bifurcation using the central manifold theorem

(BSs) transmit data to single-antenna users by using one of two linear
precoding methods with limited feedback: (i) maximum ratio transmission (MRT)
for serving a single user or (ii) zero forcing (ZF) for serving multiple users.
The BS and user locations are drawn from a Poisson point process, allowing
expressions for the signal- to-interference coverage probability and the
ergodic spectral efficiency to be derived as a function of system parameters
such as the number of BS antennas and feedback bits, and the pathloss exponent.
We find a tight lower bound on the optimum number of feedback bits to maximize
the net spectral efficiency, which captures the overall system gain by
considering both of downlink and uplink spectral efficiency using limited
feedback. Our main finding is that, when using MRT, the optimum number of
feedback bits scales linearly with the number of antennas, and logarithmically
with the channel coherence time. When using ZF, the feedback scales in the same
ways as MRT, but also linearly with the pathloss exponent. The derived results
provide system-level insights into the preferred channel codebook size by
averaging the effects of short-term fading and long-term pathloss.

accurate packaging of a wide variety of foods and vegetables, small hardware
items and office supplies. A MWM consists of a system of multiple hoppers that
are filled with product which when discharged through a funnel fills a package
to a desired weight. Operating this machine requires first to specify the
product weight targets or setpoints that each hopper should contain on average
in each cycle, which do not need to be identical. The selection of these
setpoints has a major impact on the performance of a MWM. Each cycle, the
machine fills a package running a built-in knapsack algorithm that opens --or
leaves shut-- different combinations of hoppers releasing their content such
that the total weight of each package is near to its target, minimizing the
amount of product ``given away"". In this paper, we address the practical open
problem for industry of how to determine the setpoint weights for each of the
hoppers given a desired total package weight for a widely used type of MWM. An
order statistic formulation based on a characterization of near-optimal
solutions is presented. This is shown to be computationally intractable, and a
faster heuristic that utilizes a lower bound approximation of the expected
smallest order statistic is proposed instead. The setup solutions obtained with
the proposed methods can result in substantial savings for MWM users.
Alternatively, the analysis presented could be used by management to justify
the acquisition of new MWM machines.

these conditions is that in many cases they are easily verifiable by an applied

full control of the degree of approximation. Our results also indicate where

functional theory. In spontaneous fission, half-lives are the main observables
and quantum tunnelling the essential concept, while in induced fission the
focus is on fragment properties and explicitly time-dependent approaches are
needed. The cornerstone of the current microscopic theory of fission is the
energy density functional formalism. Its basic tenets, including tools such as
the HFB theory, effective two-body effective nuclear potentials,
finite-temperature extensions and beyond mean-field corrections, are presented
succinctly. The EDF approach is often combined with the hypothesis that the
time-scale of the large amplitude collective motion driving the system to
fission is slow compared to typical time-scales of nucleons inside the nucleus.
In practice, this hypothesis of adiabaticity is implemented by introducing (a
few) collective variables and mapping out the many-body Schr\""odinger equation
into a collective Schr\""odinger-like equation for the nuclear wave-packet.
Scission configurations indicate where the split occurs. This collective
Schr\""odinger equation depends on an inertia tensor that includes the response
of the system to small changes in the collective variables and also plays a
special role in the determination of spontaneous fission half-lives. A
trademark of the microscopic theory of fission is the tremendous amount of
computing needed for practical applications. In particular, the successful
implementation of the theories presented in this article requires a very
precise numerical resolution of the HFB equations for large values of the
collective variables. Finally, a selection of the most recent and
representative results obtained for both spontaneous and induced fission is
presented with the goal of emphasizing the coherence of the microscopic
approaches employed.

foils irradiated by a short pulse laser is presented. Using two dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations the time history of the laser bullet is examined
in order to get insight into the laser energy deposition and ion acceleration
process. For laser pulses with intensity , duration 32 fs, focal spot size 5
mkm and energy 27 Joules the calculated reflection, transmission and coupling
coefficients from a 20 nm foil are 80 %, 5 % and 15 %, respectively. The
conversion efficiency into gold ions is 8 %. Two highly collimated
counter-propagating ion beams have been identified. The forward accelerated
gold ions have average and maximum charge-to-mass ratio of 0.25 and 0.3,
respectively, maximum normalized energy 25 MeV/nucleon and flux . Analytical
model was used to determine a range of foil thicknesses suitable for
acceleration of gold ions in the Radiation Pressure Acceleration regime and the
onset of the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration regime. The numerical
simulations and analytical model point to at least four technical challenges
hindering the heavy ion acceleration: low charge-to-mass ratio, limited number
of ions amenable to acceleration, delayed acceleration and high reflectivity of
the plasma. Finally, a regime suitable for heavy ion acceleration has been
identified in an alternative approach by analyzing the energy absorption and
distribution among participating species and scaling of conversion efficiency,
maximum energy, and flux with laser intensity.

homogeneous, with no micron- or nano-scale segregation evident at any

decrease in the viscosity with the addition of 5CB allows the characteristic
twist-bend stripe textures to relax into a state of uniform birefringence. We
confirm the presence of nanoscale modulations of the molecular orientation in
the mixtures by freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy (FFTEM),
further evidence of their twist-bend nature. We devise and implement a
statistical approach to quantitatively measure the ground state pitch of the

suffer from time-varying communication delays. In this paper, we consider
directed graphs, and we also relax the consistency on the packet dropouts and
the delays. Relaxing consistency means that the delays and dropouts for a
packet broadcast by one agent can be different for each receiving node. We show
that even under this challenging scenario, agents can reach consensus
asymptotically while reducing transmissions of measurements based on the
proposed event-triggered consensus protocol. In addition, positive inter-event

spherical filters to sparse regimes and generalizing the scheme and analysis to
account for different tradeoffs. In a nutshell, for the sparse regime the
tradeoff between the query complexity $n^{\rho_q}$ and update complexity
$n^{\rho_u}$ for data sets of size $n$ is given by the following equation in
terms of the approximation factor $c$ and the exponents $\rho_q$ and $\rho_u$:
$$c^2\sqrt{\rho_q}+(c^2-1)\sqrt{\rho_u}=\sqrt{2c^2-1}.$$
  For small $c=1+\epsilon$, minimizing the time for updates leads to a linear
space complexity at the cost of a query time complexity $n^{1-4\epsilon^2}$.
Balancing the query and update costs leads to optimal complexities
$n^{1/(2c^2-1)}$, matching bounds from [Andoni-Razenshteyn, 2015] and [Dubiner,
IEEE-TIT'10] and matching the asymptotic complexities of [Andoni-Razenshteyn,
STOC'15] and [Andoni-Indyk-Laarhoven-Razenshteyn-Schmidt, NIPS'15]. A
subpolynomial query time complexity $n^{o(1)}$ can be achieved at the cost of a
space complexity of the order $n^{1/(4\epsilon^2)}$, matching the bound
$n^{\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)}$ of [Andoni-Indyk-Patrascu, FOCS'06] and
[Panigrahy-Talwar-Wieder, FOCS'10] and improving upon results of
[Indyk-Motwani, STOC'98] and [Kushilevitz-Ostrovsky-Rabani, STOC'98].

[Kapralov, PODS'15] by a factor $2$, and matching the bound $n^{\Omega(1/c^2)}$

optimally designing the waveforms from multiple energy transmitters (ETs) over

optimal design of transmit waveforms requires accurate channel state

systems. In this paper, we propose a new channel training scheme to achieve
optimal EB gain in a distributed WET system, where multiple separated ETs
adjust their transmit phases to collaboratively send power to a single ER in an
iterative manner, based on one-bit feedback from the ER per training interval
which indicates the increase/decrease of the received power level from one
particular ET over two preassigned transmit phases. The proposed EB algorithm
can be efficiently implemented in practical WET systems even with a large

content delivery networks with multiple caches downstream of a common multicast
link. However, the schemes that have been shown to achieve order-optimal
perfor- mance require content items to be partitioned into a number of packets
that grows exponentially with the number of users [1]. In this paper, we first
extend the analysis of the achievable scheme in [2] to the case of
heterogeneous cache sizes and demand distribu- tions, providing an achievable
scheme and an upper bound on the limiting average performance when the number
of packets goes to infinity while the remaining system parameters are kept
constant. We then show how the scheme achieving this upper bound can very
quickly loose its multiplicative caching gain for finite content packetization.
To overcome this limitation, we design a novel polynomial-time algorithm based
on greedy local graph-coloring that, while keeping the same content
packetization, recovers a significant part of the multiplicative caching gain.
Our results show that the achievable schemes proposed to date to quantify the
limiting performance, must be properly designed for practical finite system
parameters.

past few years. A particularly studied setting is the shared link caching
network, in which a single source with access to a file library communicates
with multiple users, each having the capability to store segments (packets) of
the library files, over a shared multicast link. Each user requests one file
from the library according to a common demand distribution and the server sends
a coded multicast message to satisfy all users at once. The problem consists of
finding the smallest possible average codeword length to satisfy such requests.
In this paper, we consider the generalization to the case where each user
places L >= 1 independent requests according to the same common demand

(packetized) caching placement and multiple groupcast index coding, shown to be
order-optimal in the asymptotic regime in which the number of packets per file

investigation into the features learned on their intermediate layers. Such
research is difficult because it requires making sense of non-linear
computations performed by millions of parameters, but valuable because it
increases our ability to understand current models and create improved versions
of them. In this paper we investigate the extent to which neural networks
exhibit what we call convergent learning, which is when the representations
learned by multiple nets converge to a set of features which are either
individually similar between networks or where subsets of features span similar
low-dimensional spaces. We propose a specific method of probing
representations: training multiple networks and then comparing and contrasting
their individual, learned representations at the level of neurons or groups of
neurons. We begin research into this question using three techniques to
approximately align different neural networks on a feature level: a bipartite
matching approach that makes one-to-one assignments between neurons, a sparse
prediction approach that finds one-to-many mappings, and a spectral clustering
approach that finds many-to-many mappings. This initial investigation reveals a
few previously unknown properties of neural networks, and we argue that future
research into the question of convergent learning will yield many more. The
insights described here include (1) that some features are learned reliably in
multiple networks, yet other features are not consistently learned; (2) that
units learn to span low-dimensional subspaces and, while these subspaces are
common to multiple networks, the specific basis vectors learned are not; (3)
that the representation codes show evidence of being a mix between a local code

often suffer from the over-fitting problem. In this paper, we propose a novel
CNN-based method to learn a discriminative metric with good robustness to the
over-fitting problem in person re-identification. Firstly, a novel deep
architecture is built where the Mahalanobis metric is learned with a weight
constraint. This weight constraint is used to regularize the learning, so that
the learned metric has a better generalization ability. Secondly, we find that
the selection of intra-class sample pairs is crucial for learning but has

from the radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted by a source and then uses the
harvested energy to assist the information transmission from the source to its
destination. Both source and relay transmissions use rateless code, which
allows the destination to employ any of the two information receiving
strategies, i.e., the mutual information accumulation (IA) and the energy
accumulation (EA). The SWIPT-enabled relay employs three different SWIPT
receiver architectures, the ideal receiver and two practical receivers (i.e.,
the power splitting (PS) and the time switch (TS) receivers). Accordingly,
three relaying protocols, namely, ideal protocol, PS protocol and TS protocol,
are presented. In order to explore the system performance limits with these
three protocols, optimization problems are formulated to maximize their
achievable information rates. For the ideal protocol, explicit expressions of
the optimal solutions are derived. For the PS protocol, a linear-search
algorithm is designed to solve the non-convex problems. For the TS protocol,
two solving methods are presented. Numerical experiments are carried out to
validate our analysis and algorithms, which also show that, with the same SWIPT
receiver, the IA-based system outperforms the EA-based system, while with the
same information receiving strategy, PS protocol outperforms TS protocol.
Moreover, compared with conventional non-SWIPT and non-rateless-coded systems,
the proposed protocols exhibit considerable performance gains, especially in
relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Besides, the effects of the
source-destination direct link and the relay position on system performance are
also discussed, which provides insights on SWIPT-enabled relay systems.

$\mathcal{C} \subset \Sigma^{\mathbb{K}^n}$ is an $r$-query locally testable
code (LTC), then the number of codewords in $\mathcal{C}$ is at most
$\exp(O_{\mathbb{K}, r, |\Sigma|}(n^{r-2}))$. The dependence on $n$ in these
bounds is tight for constant-query LCCs/LTCs, since Guo, Kopparty and Sudan
(ITCS `13) construct affine-invariant codes via lifting that have the same
asymptotic tradeoffs. Note that our result holds for non-linear codes, whereas
previously, Ben-Sasson and Sudan (RANDOM `11) assumed linearity to derive
similar results.
  Our analysis uses higher-order Fourier analysis. In particular, we show that
the codewords corresponding to an affine-invariant LCC/LTC must be far from
each other with respect to Gowers norm of an appropriate order. This then
allows us to bound the number of codewords, using known decomposition theorems
which approximate any bounded function in terms of a finite number of
low-degree non-classical polynomials, upto a small error in the Gowers norm.

pipeline operations to maintain efficiency and security under these new
conditions requires optimization methods that account for transients and that
can quickly compute solutions in reaction to generator re-dispatch. This paper
presents an efficient scheme to minimize compression costs under dynamic

physics, a trapezoidal discretization in time and space, and a two-stage
approach to minimize energy costs and maximize smoothness. The resulting
large-scale nonlinear programs are solved using a modern interior-point method.
The proposed optimization scheme is validated against an integration of dynamic
equations with adaptive time-stepping, as well as a recently proposed
state-of-the-art optimal control method. The comparison shows that the
solutions are feasible for the continuous problem and also practical from an
operational standpoint. The results also indicate that our scheme provides at

Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness. We also investigate the
effects of the circuit power consumption on system performances and observe
that with both the constant and the linearly rate-dependent circuit power
consumption, system EE grows with the increment of system average channel-to

constant circuit power consumption, system EE increasing rate is an increasing
function of the system average CNR, while for the linearly rate-dependent one,
system EE increasing rate is a decreasing function of the system average CNR.
This observation is very important which indicates that by deducing the circuit

enhanced. Besides, we also discuss the effects of the number of users and

design a remote cloaking device that makes any object located at a certain
distance invisible. This is accomplished using multi-folded transformation
optics to remotely generate a hidden region around the object that no field can
penetrate and that does not disturb the far-field scattering electromagnetic
field. As a result, any object in the hidden region can stay in position or
move freely within that region and remain invisible. Our idea is further
extended in order to design a remote illusion optics that can transform any
arbitrary object into another one. Unlike other cloaking methods, this method
would require no knowledge of the details of the object itself. The proposed
multi-folded transformation optics will be crucial in the design of remote
devices in a variety of contexts.

better understand the future implementation of the cloud based software in
academic settings. Using cloud based, web based, and other remote services may
bring both advantages and disadvantages, some of which this paper will bring
out. First, a brief literature review of the academic literature, and a review
of available general-purpose cloud-based library products are conducted. Next,
a real-life scenario for a mid-sized New Zealand institution of higher
education is evaluated. This case involves moving from a locally hosted version
of EZproxy to a cloud based version with support from the vendor. As this
information system decision is an important one, this paper makes a
contribution to the available literature and can be informative for librarians.
In conclusion, academic libraries will gradually involve more pervasive use of
cloud based systems. The examples of important factors to be considered in
future decisions include timing and staffing.

occurs by two main processes: first, a massive core is formed by the accretion
of solid material; then, when this core exceeds a critical value (typically
greater than 10 Earth masses) a gaseous runaway growth is triggered and the
planet accretes big quantities of gas in a short period of time until the
planet achieves its final mass. Thus, the formation of a massive core has to
occur when the nebular gas is still available in the disk. This phenomenon
imposes a strong time-scale constraint in giant planet formation due to the
fact that the lifetimes of the observed protoplanetary disks are in general
lower than 10 Myr. The formation of massive cores before 10 Myr by accretion of
big planetesimals (with radii > 10 km) in the oligarchic growth regime is only
possible in massive disks. However, planetesimal accretion rates significantly
increase for small bodies, especially for pebbles, particles of sizes between
mm and cm, which are strongly coupled with the gas. In this work, we study the
formation of giant planets incorporating pebble accretion rates in our global
model of planet formation.

transferred throughout a network, where the flow is characterized by density
and mass flux dynamics on the edges with density continuity and mass balance
conditions at the nodes. The dynamics on each edge are represented by a general
system of partial differential equations that approximates subsonic
compressible fluid flow with energy dissipation. The transferred commodity may
be injected or withdrawn at any of the nodes, and is propelled throughout the
network by nodally located compressors. These compressors are controllable
actuators that provide a means to manipulate flows through the network, which
we therefore consider as a control system. A canonical problem requires
compressor control protocols to be chosen such that time-varying nodal
commodity withdrawal profiles are delivered and the density remains within
strict limits while an economic or operational cost objective is optimized. In
this manuscript, we consider the situation where each nodal commodity
withdrawal profile is uncertain, but is bounded within known maximum and
minimum time-dependent limits. We introduce the monotone parameterized control
system property, and prove that general dynamic dissipative network flows
possess this characteristic under certain conditions. This property facilitates
very efficient formulation of optimal control problems for such systems in
which the solutions must be robust with respect to commodity withdrawal
uncertainty. We discuss several applications in which such control problems
arise and where monotonicity enables simplified characterization of system
behavior.

various torsional constructions, from teleparallel, to Einstein-Cartan, and
metric-affine gauge theories, resulting in extending torsional gravity in the
paradigm of f(T) gravity, where f(T) is an arbitrary function of the torsion
scalar. Based on this theory, we further review the corresponding cosmological
and astrophysical applications. In particular, we study cosmological solutions
arising from f(T) gravity, both at the background and perturbation levels, in
different eras along the cosmic expansion. The f(T) gravity construction can
provide a theoretical interpretation of the late-time universe acceleration,
and it can easily accommodate with the regular thermal expanding history
including the radiation and cold dark matter dominated phases. Furthermore, if
one traces back to very early times, a sufficiently long period of inflation
can be achieved and hence can be investigated by cosmic microwave background
observations, or alternatively, the Big Bang singularity can be avoided due to
the appearance of non-singular bounces. Various observational constraints,
especially the bounds coming from the large-scale structure data in the case of
f(T) cosmology, as well as the behavior of gravitational waves, are described
in detail. Moreover, the spherically symmetric and black hole solutions of the
theory are reviewed. Additionally, we discuss various extensions of the f(T)
paradigm. Finally, we consider the relation with other modified gravitational
theories, such as those based on curvature, like f(R) gravity, trying to
enlighten the subject of which formulation might be more suitable for
quantization ventures and cosmological applications.

over which the heliocentric distance decreased from 5.1 AU to 0.35 AU),
allowing monitoring of the long-term evolution of coma morphology during the
pre-perihelion leg of comet ISON. Data were contributed by observers spread
around the world, resulting in particularly good temporal coverage during
November when comet ISON was brightest but its visibility was limited from any
one location due to the small solar elongation. We analyze the northwestern
sunward continuum coma feature observed in comet ISON during the first half of
2013, finding that it was likely present from at least February through May and
did not show variations on diurnal time scales. From these images we constrain
the grain velocities to ~10 m/s, and we find that the grains spent 2-4 weeks in
the sunward side prior to merging with the dust tail. We present a rationale
for the lack of continuum coma features from September until mid-November 2013,
determining that if the feature from the first half of 2013 was present, it was
likely too small to be clearly detected. We also analyze the continuum coma
morphology observed subsequent to the November 12 outburst, and constrain the

  (1) The observable spatial-geometry characteristics of our empty-space

distance between two space-attached observers (``Alice and Bob'').
  (2) For any pre-selected guess of the simple, non-covariant time-dependent
observable $Q(t)$ one of the Kato's exceptional points (viz., $t=\tau_{(EP)}$)
is postulated {\em real-valued}. This enables us to treat it as the time of Big
Bang.
  (3) During our ``Eon'' (i.e., at all $t>\tau_{(EP)}$) the observability
status of operator $Q(t)$ is mathematically guaranteed by its self-adjoint
nature with respect to an {\em ad hoc} Hilbert-space metric $\Theta(t) \neq I$.
  (4) In adiabatic approximation (i.e., in Heisenberg picture) the passage of
the Universe through its $t=\tau_{(EP)}$ singularity is interpreted as a
quantum phase transition between the preceding and the present Eon.
  It is worth adding that in our model the widely accepted ``Big Bounce''
regularization of the classical Big Bang singularity after quantization gets
replaced by the full-fledged quantum degeneracy. At the
quantum-phase-transition singularity, operator $Q(\tau_{(EP)})$ becomes
unobservable and acquires a non-diagonalizable Jordan-block structure.

feature'' in the spectral hard state. Similar spectral features are often
observed in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and other black-hole binaries (BHBs),
and several models have been proposed for explaining it. In order to
distinguish spectral models, time variation provides an important key. In AGNs,
variation amplitude has been found to drop significantly at the iron K-energy
band at timescales of ~10 ks. If spectral variations of black-holes are
normalized by their masses, the spectral variations of BHBs at timescales of
sub-seconds should exhibit similar characteristics to those of AGNs. In this
paper, we investigated spectral variations of GRS 1915+105 at timescales down
to ~10 ms. This was made possible for the first time with the Suzaku XIS
Parallel-sum clocking (P-sum) mode, which has the CCD energy-resolution as well
as a time-resolution of 7.8 ms. Consequently, we found that the variation
amplitude of GRS 1915+105 does not drop at the iron K-energy band at any
timescales from 0.06 s to 63000 s, and that the entire X-ray flux and the iron
feature are independently variable at timescales of hours. These are naturally
understood in the framework of the ``partial covering'' model, in which
variation timescales of the continuum flux and partial absorbers are
independent. The difference of energy dependence of the variation amplitude
between AGN and BHB is presumably due to different mechanisms of the outflow
winds, i.e., the partial absorbers are due to UV-line driven winds (AGN) or
thermally-driven winds (BHB).

packets. They have been extensively studied in many branches of physics.
Solitons in periodic systems, which have become the mainstream of soliton
research in the past decade, are localized states supported by photonic
bandgaps. In this Letter, we report the discovery of a new type of solitons
located at the Dirac point beyond photonic bandgaps. The Dirac point is a
conical singularity of a photonic band structure where wave motion obeys the
famous Dirac equation. These new solitons are sustained by the Dirac point
rather than photonic bandgaps, thus provides a sort of advance in conceptual
understanding over the traditional gap solitons. Apart from their theoretical
impact within soliton theory, they have many potential uses because such
solitons have dramatic stability characteristics and are possible in both Kerr
material and photorefractive crystals that possess self-focusing and
self-defocusing nonlinearities. The new results elegantly reveal that
traditional photonic bandgaps are not required when Dirac points are
accessible. The findings enrich the soliton family and provide valuable
information for studies of nonlinear waves in many branches of physics,
including hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and Bose Einstein condensates.

the distortion caused by the quantization of the received signal at the RUs. In

the effect of fronthaul quantization with or without dithering. An approximate
Maximum Likelihood (ML) localization is developed. Then, the Cramer-Rao Bound

accurate studies of first order vapour-liquid phase transitions in model

to the overall number density in order to overcome the free energy barrier
associated with mixed phase states. However, at low temperature and for large
system size, this approach suffers a drastic slowing down in sampling
efficiency. The culprits are geometrically induced transitions (stemming from
the periodic boundary conditions) which involve changes in droplet shape from
sphere to cylinder and cylinder to slab. Since the overall number density
doesn't discriminate sufficiently between these shapes, it fails as an order
parameter for biasing through the transitions. Here we report two approaches to
ameliorating these difficulties. The first introduces a droplet shape based
order parameter that generates a transition path from vapour to slab states for
which spherical and cylindrical droplet are suppressed. The second simply
biases with respect to the number density in a tetragonal subvolume of the

published in past years present different behaviours for a given accretion
rate. We then revisit the question of the accretion rate, which allows us to
understand the distribution of the observed pre-main-sequence (pre-MS) stars in
the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. Finally, we identify the conditions
needed to obtain a large inflation of the star along its pre-MS evolution that
may push the birthline towards the Hayashi line in the upper part of the HR
diagram. We present new pre-MS models including accretion at various rates and
for different initial structures of the accreting core. From the observed upper
envelope of pre-MS stars in the HR diagram, we deduce the accretion law that
best matches the accretion history of most of the intermediate-mass stars. In
the case of cold disc accretion, the existence of a significant swelling during
the accretion phase, which leads to radii $\gtrsim100\,R_\odot$ and brings the
star back to the red part of the HR diagram, depends sensitively on the initial
conditions. For an accretion rate of $10^{-3}\,M_\odot\rm\,yr^{-1}$, only
models starting from a core with a significant radiative region evolve back to
the red part of the HR diagram. We also obtain that, in order to reproduce the

Stokes Polarimeter (GASP), the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for

angle has been observed by this work, from 109.5 \pm 0.7\deg in 2005 to 85.3

changed from 115 \pm 11 \deg in 2003-2007 to 80 \pm 12 \deg in 2012-2014.
Strong flaring activities have been detected in the Crab nebula over the past
few years by the high energy {\gamma}-ray missions Agile and Fermi, and
magnetic reconnection processes have been suggested to explain these
observations. The change in the polarized optical and {\gamma}-ray emission of
the Crab nebula/pulsar as observed, for the first time, by GASP and Integral

report, for the first time, a non-zero measure of the optical circular

$b$ blue elements and $r$ red elements, positive integers $k_\ell$ and $k_r$,
and a family $\F$ of $\ell$ sets over $U$, the \srbsc\ problem is to decide
whether there is a subfamily $\F'\subseteq \F$ of size at most $k_\ell$ that
covers all blue elements, but at most $k_r$ of the red elements. This
generalizes SET COVER and thus in full generality it is intractable in the
parameterized setting. In this paper, we study a geometric version of this
problem, called Gen-RBSC-lines, where the elements are points in the plane and
sets are defined by lines. We study this problem for an array of parameters,
namely, $k_\ell, k_r, r, b$, and $\ell$, and all possible combinations of them.
For all these cases, we either prove that the problem is W-hard or show that
the problem is fixed parameter tractable (FPT). In particular, on the
algorithmic side, our study shows that a combination of $k_\ell$ and $k_r$
gives rise to a nontrivial algorithm for Gen-RBSC-lines. On the hardness side,
we show that the problem is para-NP-hard when parameterized by $k_r$, and
W[1]-hard when parameterized by $k_\ell$. Finally, for the combination of
parameters for which Gen-RBSC-lines admits FPT algorithms, we ask for the
existence of polynomial kernels. We are able to provide a complete
kernelization dichotomy by either showing that the problem admits a polynomial
kernel or that it does not contain a polynomial kernel unless $\CoNP \subseteq

only the Dirac state but all the single particle states remain extended for
weak enough disorder. Based on our numerical calculations of inverse
participation ratio, dc conductivity, diffusion coefficient and the
localization length from time evolution dynamics of the wave packet, we show
that the threshold $V_{th}$ required to localize a single particle state of

for states near the band center, implying a mobility edge starting from the
band edge for weak disorder and moving towards the band center as the disorder
strength increases. This can be explained in terms of the low energy
Hamiltonian at any point $\vec{k}$ which has the same nature as that at the
Dirac point. From the nature of the eigenfunctions it follows that a weak long
range impurity will cause weak anti localization effects, which can be
suppressed, giving localization if the strength of impurities is sufficiently
large to cause inter-valley scattering. The inter valley spacing $2|\vec{k}|$
increases as one moves in from the band edge towards the band center, which is
reflected in the behavior of $V_{th}$ and the mobility edge.

organelles are essential for immune responses, tissue formation, and signaling.
These processes depend sensitively on the binding constant K2D of the
membrane-anchored receptor and ligand proteins that mediate adhesion, which is
difficult to measure in the 'two-dimensional' (2D) membrane environment of the
proteins. An important problem therefore is to relate K2D} to the binding
constant K3D} of soluble variants of the receptors and ligands that lack the
membrane anchors and are free to diffuse in three dimensions (3D). In this
article, we present a general theory for the binding constants K2D and K3D of
rather stiff proteins whose main degrees of freedom are translation and
rotation, along membranes and around anchor points 'in 2D', or unconstrained
'in 3D'. The theory generalizes previous results by describing how K2D depends
both on the average separation and thermal nanoscale roughness of the apposing
membranes, and on the length and anchoring flexibility of the receptors and
ligands. Our theoretical results for the ratio K2D/K3D of the binding constants
agree with detailed results from Monte Carlo simulations without any data
fitting, which indicates that the theory captures the essential features of the
'dimensionality reduction' due to membrane anchoring. In our Monte Carlo
simulations, we consider a novel coarse-grained model of biomembrane adhesion
in which the membranes are represented as discretized elastic surfaces, and the
receptors and ligands as anchored molecules that diffuse continuously along the
membranes and rotate at their anchor points.

theory of spin fluctuations of electrons and electron-hole complexes for
non-equilibrium conditions. In this paper we consider a range of physical

studies. The objective of such research is often to identify the smallest
possible set of genes that can still achieve good predictive performance. The
problem of assigning tumours to a known class is a particularly important
example that has received considerable attention in the last ten years. Many of
the classification methods proposed recently require some form of
dimension-reduction of the problem. These methods provide a single model as an
output and, in most cases, rely on the likelihood function in order to achieve
variable selection.
  Results: We propose a prediction-based objective function that can be
tailored to the requirements of practitioners and can be used to assess and
interpret a given problem. The direct optimization of such a function can be
very difficult because the problem is potentially discontinuous and nonconvex.
We therefore propose a general procedure for variable selection that resembles
importance sampling to explore the feature space. Our proposal compares
favorably with competing alternatives when applied to two cancer data sets in
that smaller models are obtained for better or at least comparable
classification errors. Furthermore by providing a set of selected models
instead of a single one, we construct a network of possible models for a target
prediction accuracy level.

regular temporal and spectral evolution, making it an ideal source for
exploring the nature of very faint X-ray transients (VFXTs). In this work, we
present a detailed analysis on both X-ray and near-ultraviolet (NUV) light
curves. The fluxes at all wavelengths display a near-exponential decays in the
early phase and transits to a faster-decay at late times. The e-folding decay
time-scales monotonically decrease with photon energies, and the derived
viscous time-scale is $\tau_{\rm \dot{M}} \sim 60$ days. The time-scale in the
late faster-decay stage is about a few days. The high ratio of NUV luminosity
to X-ray luminosity indicates that the irradiation is unimportant in this
outburst, while the near-exponential decay profile and the long decay
time-scales conflict with the disc thermal-viscous instability model. We thus
suggest that the disc is thermally stable during the observations. Adopting the
truncated disc model, we obtain a lower limit of peak accretion rate of $0.03
\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ and the X-ray radiative efficiency $\eta < 5\times10^{-4}$,
which decreases as the luminosity declines. The low X-ray radiative efficiency
is caused by the combined action of advection and outflows, and naturally
explains that the X-ray reprocessing is overwhelmed by the viscous radiation of
the outer standard disc in the NUV regime. We also propose a possibility that
the outer standard disc recedes from the central black hole, resulting in the
faster-decay at late times.

The active motion of the axoneme, the motile structure inside cilia and

generate forces and torques that slide and bend the microtubule doublets within
the axoneme. To create regular waveforms the activities of the dyneins must be
coordinated. It is thought that coordination is mediated by stresses due to
radial, transverse, or sliding deformations, that build up within the moving
axoneme. However, which particular component of the stress regulates the motors
to produce the observed flagellar waveforms remains an open question. To
address this question, we describe the axoneme as a three-dimensional bundle of
filaments and characterize its mechanics. We show that regulation of the motors
by radial and transverse stresses can lead to a coordinated flagellar motion
only in the presence of twist. By comparison, regulation by shear stress is
possible without twist. We calculate emergent beating patterns in twisted
axonemes resulting from regulation by transverse stresses. The waveforms are
similar to those observed in flagella of Chlamydomonas and sperm. Due to the
twist, the waveform has non-planar components, which result in swimming
trajectories such as twisted ribbons and helices that agree with observations.

large-scale materials simulations including both atomic and electronic degrees
of freedom on the same footing. The method is based on a predictive
quantum-mechanical theory, e.g., Density Functional Theory, and its accuracy
can be systematically improved at a very modest computational cost. Our
approach is based on dividing the electron density of the system into a
reference part - typically corresponding to the system's neutral,
geometry-dependent ground state - and a deformation part - defined as the
difference between the actual and reference densities. We then take advantage
of the fact that the bulk part of the system's energy depends on the reference
density alone; this part can be efficiently and accurately described by a force
field, thus avoiding explicit consideration of the electrons. Then, the effects
associated to the difference density can be treated perturbatively with good
precision by working in a suitably chosen Wannier function basis. Further, the
electronic model can be restricted to the bands of interest. All these features
combined yield a very flexible and computationally very efficient scheme. Here
we present the basic formulation of this approach, as well as a practical
strategy to compute model parameters for realistic materials. We illustrate the
accuracy and scope of the proposed method with two case studies, namely, the
relative stability of various spin arrangements in NiO and the formation of a
two-dimensional electron gas at the interface between band insulators LaAlO$_3$
and SrTiO$_3$. We conclude by discussing ways to overcome the limitations of
the present approach (most notably, the assumption of a fixed bonding
topology), as well as its many envisioned possibilities and future extensions.

fluctuations with a convective character. The presented extension to the TPP
improves the splitting between acoustics and the rest of the unsteady flow
field. The method is simple: i) the acoustic eigenmodes are analytically
determined for a uniform mean flow as in the original TPP; ii) the suggested
model for convective pressure perturbations uses the convective wavenumber as
axial wavenumber and the same orthogonal radial shape functions as for the
acoustic modes. The reliability is demonstrated on the simulation data of a

transistors is investigated by exploring field-effect transistors with various
gate lengths fabricated from LaAlO$_3$-SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures. The studies
reveal the existence of channel-length modulation and drain-induced barrier
lowering for gate lengths below 1 {\mu}m, with a characteristic behavior
comparable to semiconducting devices. With the fabrication of field-effect
transistors with gate lengths as small as 60 nm the results demonstrate the
possibility to fabricate by electron-beam lithography functional devices based
on complex oxides with characteristic lengths of several ten nanometers.

tool to test analytical transport theories and to predict mean-free paths. The
comparison between solutions of the diffusion equation and the particle flux is
used to critically judge the applicability of diffusion to the stochastic
transport of energetic particles in magnetized turbulence. Methods. A
Monte-Carlo simulation code is extended to allow for the generation of
intensity profiles as well as anisotropy-time profiles. Due to the relatively
low number density of computational particles, a kernel function has to be used
to describe the spatial extent of each particle. Results. The obtained
intensity profiles are interpreted as solutions of the diffusion equation by
inserting the diffusion coefficients that have been directly determined from
the mean-square displacements. The comparison shows that the time dependence of
the diffusion coefficients needs to be considered, in particular the initial
ballistic phase and the often sub-diffusive perpendicular coefficient.
Conclusions. It is argued that the perpendicular component of the distribution
function is essential if agreement between the diffusion solution and the
simulated flux is to be obtained. In addition, time-dependent diffusion can
provide a better description than the classic diffusion equation only after the
initial ballistic phase.

marginally higher than Tc. Magnetization studies provide an evidence of bulk
superconductivity in Sr0.5Ce0.5FBiS2-xSex. Quite remarkably, as compared with

Ce-moment in the superconducting state is rather small (~ 0.1 muB). To the best
of our knowledge, the title compounds are the first Ce-based superconducting
itinerant ferromagnetic materials (Tc < TFM). We stress that Ce-4f electrons

method to the Landau-Zener problem, we computationally study the survival
fidelity of adiabatic states without Born, Markov, rotating-wave or other
perturbative approximations. With this treatment it also becomes possible to
investigate cases with very strong system-bath coupling. Different from a
previous study of infinite-time Landau-Zener processes, the fidelity of the
time-evolving state as compared with instantaneous adiabatic states shows
non-monotonic dependence on the system-bath coupling and on the sweep rate of
the bias. We then consider the effect of applying a counter-diabatic driving
field, which is found to be useful in improving the fidelity only for
sufficiently short Landau-Zener processes. Numerically exact results show that
different counter-diabatic driving fields can have much different robustness
against environment effects. Lastly, using a case study we discuss the
possibility of introducing a dynamical decoupling field in order to eliminate
the decoherence effect of the environment and at the same time to retain the
positive role of a counter-diabatic field. Our work indicates that finite-time
Landau-Zener processes with counter-diabatic driving offer a fruitful test bed

(pre-CVs) are dominated by systems with low-mass white dwarfs (WDs), while the
WD masses in CVs are typically high. In addition, the space density of CVs is
found to be significantly lower than theoretical models. We investigate the
influence of nova outbursts on the formation and (initial) evolution of CVs. In
particular, we calculate the stability of the mass transfer in case all the
material accreted on the WD is lost in classical novae, and part of the energy
to eject the material comes from a common-envelope like interaction with the
companion. In addition, we study the effect of an asymmetry in the mass
ejection, that may lead to small eccentricities in the orbit. We find that a
common-envelope like ejection significantly decreases the stability of the mass
transfer, in particular for low-mass WD. Similarly, the influence of asymmetric
mass loss can be important for short-period systems and even more so for
low-mass WD, but likely disappears long before the next nova outburst due to
orbital circularization. In both cases the mass-transfer rates increase, which
may lead to observable (and perhaps already observed) consequences for systems
that do survive to become CVs. However, a more detailed investigation of the
interaction between nova ejecta and the companion and the evolution of slightly
eccentric CVs is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.

machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. Diversity in 2G devices can be present
both in form of multiple receive branches and blind repetitions. In presence of
diversity, intersymbol interference (ISI) equalization and co-channel
interference (CCI) suppression are usually very complex. In this paper, we
consider the improvements for 2G devices with receive diversity. We derive a
low-complexity receiver based on a channel shortening filter, which allows to
sum up all diversity branches to a single stream after filtering while keeping
the full diversity gain. The summed up stream is subsequently processed by a
single stream Max-log-MAP (MLM) equalizer. The channel shortening filter is
designed to maximize the mutual information lower bound (MILB) with the
Ungerboeck detection model. Its filter coefficients can be obtained mainly by
means of discrete-Fourier transforms (DFTs). Compared with the state-of-art
homomorphic (HOM) filtering based channel shortener which cooperates with a
delayed-decision feedback MLM (DDF-MLM) equalizer, the proposed MILB channel
shortener has superior performance. Moreover, the equalization complexity, in
terms of real-valued multiplications, is decreased by a factor that equals the
number of diversity branches.

the sensitivity conjecture, which (in one of its many forms) asserts that the
degree of a boolean function (i.e. the minimum degree of a real polynomial that
interpolates the function) is bounded above by some fixed power of its
sensitivity (which is the maximum vertex degree of the graph defined on the
inputs where two inputs are adjacent if they differ in exactly one coordinate
and their function values are different). We propose an attack on the
sensitivity conjecture in terms of a novel two-player communication game. A
lower bound of the form $n^{\Omega(1)}$ on the cost of this game would imply
the sensitivity conjecture.
  To investigate the problem of bounding the cost of the game, three natural
(stronger) variants of the question are considered. For two of these variants,
protocols are presented that show that the hoped for lower bound does not hold.
These protocols satisfy a certain monotonicity property, and (in contrast to
the situation for the two variants) we show that the cost of any monotone
protocol satisfies a strong lower bound.
  There is an easy upper bound of $\sqrt{n}$ on the cost of the game. We also
improve slightly on this upper bound.

described by the generating function of the offspring law and its fixed points.
Branching random walks are a natural generalization of branching processes: a
branching process can be seen as a one-dimensional branching random walk. We
define a multidimensional generating function associated to a given branching
random walk. The present paper investigates the similarities and the
differences of the generating functions, their fixed points and the
implications on the underlying stochastic process, between the one-dimensional
(branching process) and the multidimensional case (branching random walk). In
particular, we show that the generating function of a branching random walk can
have uncountably many fixed points and a fixed point may not be an extinction
probability, even in the irreducible case (extinction probabilities are always
fixed points). Moreover, the generating function might not be a convex
function. We also study how the behaviour of a branching random walk is
affected by local modifications of the process. As a corollary, we describe a
general procedure with which we can modify a continuous-time branching random
walk which has a weak phase and turn it into a continuous-time branching random
walk which has strong local survival for large or small values of the parameter
and non-strong local survival for intermediate values of the parameter.

context of hard photon spectra of blazars. It is well known that this
acceleration mechanism can produce a hard electron spectrum of $m \equiv
\partial \ln n_{\rm e}(\gamma)/\partial \ln \gamma = 2$ with the high-energy
cutoff, called an ultrarelativistic Maxwellian-like distribution, where $n_{\rm
e}(\gamma)$ is an electron energy spectrum. We revisit the formation of this
characteristic spectrum, considering a particular situation where the electrons
are accelerated through gyroresonant interaction with magnetohydrodynamic wave
turbulence driven by the turbulent cascade. By solving kinetic equations of the
turbulent fields, electrons, and photons emitted via the synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) process, we demonstrate that in the non-test-particle
treatment, the formation of a Maxwellian-like distribution is prevented by the
damping effect on the turbulent fields due to the electron acceleration, at
least unless an extreme parameter value is chosen. Instead, a softer electron
spectrum with the index of $m \approx -1$ is produced if the Kolmogorov-type
cascade is assumed. The SSC spectrum that originates from the resultant softer
electron spectrum is still hard, but somewhat softer and broader than the case
of $m=2$. This change of achievable hardness should be noted when this basic
particle acceleration scenario is tested with observations of hard photon
spectra accurately.

by the force derived from a potential as well as by diffusion properties. In
this work, we obtain the first-passage-time statistics of a Brownian particle

superimposed field up to a prescribed threshold. The general system analyzed
here describes the sub-threshold signal integration of integrate-and-fire
neuron models, of any kind, supplemented by an adaptation-like current, whereas
the first-passage-time corresponds to the declaration of a spike. Following our
previous studies, we base our analysis on the backward Fokker Planck equation
and study the survival probability and the first-passage-time density function
in the space of the initial condition. By proposing a series solution we obtain
a system of recurrence equations, which given the specific structure of the
exponential time-dependent drift, easily admit a simpler Laplace
representation. Naturally, the present general derivation agrees with the
explicit solution we found previously for the Wiener process in (2012 JPhysA 45
185001). However, to demonstrate the generality of the approach, we further
explicitly evaluate the first-passage-time statistics of the underlying
Ornstein Uhlenbeck process. To test the validity of the series solution, we
extensively compare theoretical expressions with the data obtained from
numerical simulations in different regimes. As shown, agreement is precise
whenever the series is truncated at an appropriate order. Beyond the fact that
both the Wiener and Ornstein Uhlenbeck processes have a direct interpretation
in the context of neuronal models, given their ubiquity in different fields,
our present results will be of interest in other settings where an additive
state-independent temporal relaxation process is being developed as the

electron scattering on longitudinal optical phonons, charged impurities, and

the increase of the electron concentration in the well enhances the screening

the solar equatorial plane were about four times more common than ropes with
high inclinations, possibly an observational effect. Left and right-handed
ropes were observed in almost equal numbers. In addition, data from MES, VEX,
STEREO-A, STEREO-B and ACE were examined for multipoint signatures of the
catalogued ICMEs. For spacecraft separations below 15{\deg} in heliocentric
longitude, the second spacecraft observed the ICME flux rope in 82% of cases;

for separations between 30 and 45{\deg}, and to 12% for separations between 45

that only the sheath and not the flux rope of the ICME was observed, in
agreement with the notion that ICME flux ropes are smaller in longitudinal

star's position at a reference time, one can compute its position at any other
time, no matter how remote. One can also compute the velocities with which the
star will pass through any given point and the contribution it will make to the
time-averaged density there. A system of angle-action coordinates for the given

on a grid of tori.

in several contexts, including setting up initial conditions for an N-body
simulation. We examine the precision of the orbital tori created by TM and the

quantized topological invariant, realized in chiral-lattice magnets are
currently attracting intense research interest. In particular, their dynamics
under external fields is an issue of vital importance both for fundamental
science and for technical application. Whereas observations of magnetic
skyrmions had been limited to metallic magnets so far, their realization was
discovered also in a chiral-lattice insulating magnet Cu2OSeO3 in 2012.
Skyrmions in the insulator turned out to exhibit multiferroic nature with
spin-induced ferroelectricity. Strong magnetoelectric coupling between
noncollinear skyrmion spins and electric polarizations mediated by relativistic
spin-orbit interaction enables us to drive motion and oscillation of magnetic
skyrmions by application of electric fields instead of injection of electric
currents. Insulating materials also provide an environment suitable for
detection of pure spin dynamics through spectroscopic measurements owing to
absence of appreciable charge excitations. In this article, we review recent
theoretical and experimental studies on multiferroic properties and dynamical
magnetoelectric phenomena of magnetic skyrmions in insulators. We argue that
multiferroic skyrmions show unique coupled oscillation modes of magnetizations
and polarizations, so-called electromagnon excitations, which are both
magnetically and electrically active, and interference between the electric and
magnetic activation processes leads to peculiar magnetoelectric effects in a
microwave frequency regime.

acting on scales ranging from micrometers (the sticking and restructuring of
aggregates) to hundreds of astronomical units (the size of the turbulent
protoplanetary nebula). Considering these processes simultaneously is essential
when studying planetesimal formation. We develop a novel, global,
semi-analytical model for the evolution of the mass-dominating dust particles
in a turbulent protoplanetary disk that takes into account the evolution of the
dust surface density while preserving the essential characteristics of the
porous coagulation process. This panoptic model is used to study the growth
from submicron to planetesimal sizes in disks around Sun-like stars. For highly
porous ices, unaffected by collisional fragmentation and erosion, rapid growth
to planetesimal sizes is possible in a zone stretching out to
${\sim}10\mathrm{~AU}$ for massive disks. When porous coagulation is limited by
erosive collisions, the formation of planetesimals through direct coagulation
is not possible, but the creation of a large population of aggregates with
Stokes numbers close to unity might trigger the streaming instability (SI).
However, we find that reaching conditions necessary for SI is difficult and
limited to dust-rich disks, (very) cold disks, or disks with weak turbulence.
Behind the snow-line, porosity-driven aggregation of icy grains results in
rapid (${\sim}10^{4}\mathrm{~yr}$) formation of planetesimals. If erosive
collisions prevent this, SI might be triggered for specific disk conditions.
The numerical approach introduced in this work is ideally suited for studying
planetesimal formation and pebble delivery simultaneously and will help build a
coherent picture of the start of the planet formation process.

magnetic field. During a solar cycle, sunspots, i.e. extended regions of strong
magnetic fields, occur in activity belts that are slowly migrating from middle
to lower latitudes, finally arriving close to the equator during the cycle
maximum phase. While this have been well known for centuries, much less is
known about the solar cycle evolution of small-scale magnetic fields. Aims. To
address this question, we study magnetic bright points (MBPs) as proxies for
such small-scale, kG solar magnetic fields. This study is based on a
homogeneous data set that covers a period of eight years. Methods. An automated
MBP identification algorithm was applied to the synoptic Hinode/SOT G-band data
over the period November 2006 to August 2014, i.e. covering the decreasing
phase of Cycle 23 and the rise, maximum, and early decrease of Cycle 24. This
data set includes, at the moment of investigation, a total of 4 162 images,
with about 2.9 million single MBP detections. Results. After a careful
preselection and monthly median filtering of the data, the investigation
revealed that the number of MBPs close to the equator is coupled to the global
solar cycle but shifted in time by about 2.5 years. Furthermore, the
instantaneous number of detected MBPs depends on the hemisphere, with one
hemisphere being more prominent, i.e. showing a higher number of MBPs. After
the end of Cycle 23 and at the starting point of Cycle 24, the more active
hemisphere changed from south to north. Conclusions. These findings suggest
that there is indeed a coupling between the activity of MBPs close to the
equator with the global magnetic field. The results also indicate that a
significant fraction of the magnetic flux that is visible as MBPs close to the
equator originates from the sunspot activity belts.

supply chain where a set of suppliers serve a set of terminal facilities that
receive uncertain customer demands. This model integrates a number of system
decisions in both the planning and operational stages, including facility
location, multi-level service assignments, multi-modal transportation
configuration, and inventory management. In particular, we consider
probabilistic supplier disruptions that may halt product supply from certain
suppliers from time to time. To mitigate the impact from supplier disruptions,
a terminal facility may be assigned to multiple supplies that back up each
other with different service priorities. With such multi-level service
assignments, even when some suppliers are disrupted, a facility may still be
supplied by the remaining functioning suppliers. Expensive expedited shipments
yet with assured fast delivery may be used in complement to less expensive
regular shipments yet with uncertain long lead times. Combining these two
shipment modes can better leverage the inventory management against uncertain
demands. We formulate this problem into a mix-integer nonlinear program that
simultaneously determines all these interdependent system decisions to minimize
the expected system cost under uncertainties from both suppliers and demands. A
customized solution algorithm based on the Lagrangian relaxation is developed
to efficiently solve this model. Several numerical examples are conduced to
test the proposed model and draw managerial insights into how the key
parameters affect the optimal system design.

the logarithmic derivative of the Hardy Z function $Z(t)=e^{i\vartheta

function, and $\zeta (t)$ is the Riemann zeta function, is used as a basis for
the construction of a pair of transcendental entire functions
$\nu(t)=-\nu(1-t)=-{\Delta R(\frac{i}{2}-it)}^{-1}=-G(\frac{i}{2}-it)$ where
$G=-({\Delta}R(t))^{-1}$ is the derivative of the additive inverse of the
reciprocal of the Laplacian of $R(t)$ and $\chi(t)=-\chi(1-t)=\dot{\nu}

and maxima of $G(t)$. When $H(t)=0$ and $\dot{H} (t)=\ddot{G}

with a Riemann zero, i.e., $\zeta(\frac{1}{2}+it)=0$, otherwise when $H(t)=0$
and $\dot{H} (t)={\Delta}G(t)<0$, the point $t$ marks a local maximum of
$G(t)$, marking midway points between consecutive minima. Considered as a
sequence of distributions or wave functions, $\nu_n(t)=\nu(1+2n+2t)$ converges
to $\nu_\infty (t)=lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \nu_n (t)={\sin}^2(\pi t)$ and

with dependence on this type of fractional operator. The formula only depends
on first-order derivatives, and thus we convert the fractional problem into a
standard one. With some examples we show the accuracy of the method, and then
we present the utility of the method by solving a fractional integral equation.

homothetic vectors in the context of Lyra geometry. The non-linear coupled Lyra
homothetic equations are obtained and solved completely for different cases. In
some cases, Bianchi type I spacetimes admit proper Lyra homothetic vectors
(LHVs) for special choices of the metric functions, while there exist other
cases where the spacetime under consideration admits only Lyra Killing vectors
(LKVs). In all the possible cases where Bianchi type I spacetimes admit proper
LHVs or LKVs, we obtained homothetic and Killing vectors for Bianchi type I
spacetimes in general relativity by taking the displacement vector of Lyra
geometry as zero. Matter collineation symmetry is explained by taking the
matter field as a perfect fluid. The obtained proper LHVs and LKVs are used in
matter collineation equations and a barotropic equation of state having
$\rho(t)\,=\,\gamma\,p(t)$, $0\,\leq\,\gamma\,\leq\,1$ form is always obtained
when the displacement vector is considered as a function of $t$ or treated as a
constant.

simulation algorithm. The method is based on the addition of a series of random
variables and is derived using the convolution theorem. The final distribution
is derived and approximated in the frequency domain. The distribution for the
final time is transformed back to the real domain and can be sampled from in a
simulation. The result is an approximation of the classical stochastic
simulation algorithm that requires fewer random variates. An analysis of the
error and speedup compared to the stochastic simulation algorithm is presented.

assumptions or external parameter fitting. As defects proliferate, the low
density of states near the Fermi levels of the pristine tubes is filled with
defect states. The increase of DOS at the Fermi level leads to enhanced
conduction, which indicates enhanced metallicity due to SW defects in the
nanotubes.

absorbing photonic crystal slab of arbitrary geometry is developed for
photovoltaic applications. The semi-analytic approach allows efficient and
accurate calculation of the absorption of an array with a complex unit cell.
This approach gives direct physical insight into the absorption mechanism in
such structures, which can be used to enhance the absorption. The verification
and validation of this approach is applied to a silicon nanowire array and the
efficiency and accuracy of the method is demonstrated. The method is ideally
suited to studying the manner in which spectral properties (e.g., absorption)
vary with the thickness of the array, and we demonstrate this with efficient
calculations which can identify an optimal geometry.
