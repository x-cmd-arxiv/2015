decompositions to all representations, not only the irreducible ones. However,
it is not even clear what is meant by a spectral decomposition when one works
with non-abelian reductive groups and with ramification. The present work is
meant to clarify the situation, showing that the two obvious candidates for
such a notion coincide.
  More broadly, we study the moduli space of (possibly irregular) de Rham local
systems from the perspective of homological algebra. We show that, in spite of
its infinite-dimensional nature, this moduli space shares many of the nice
features of an Artin stack. Less broadly, these results support the belief in
the existence of a version of geometric Langlands allowing arbitrary
ramification.
  Along the way, we give some apparently new, if unsurprising, results about
the algebraic geometry of the moduli space of connections, using
Babbitt-Varadarajan's reduction theory for differential equations.

problems on graphs and on matrices, when the given instance has low treewidth;
in the case of matrices, we consider the treewidth of the graph formed by
non-zero entries. In each of the considered cases, the best known algorithms
working on general graphs run in polynomial time, however the exponent of the
polynomial is large. Therefore, our main goal is to construct algorithms with
running time of the form $\textrm{poly}(k)\cdot n$ or $\textrm{poly}(k)\cdot
n\log n$, where $k$ is the width of the tree decomposition given on the input.
Such procedures would outperform the best known algorithms for the considered
problems already for moderate values of the treewidth, like $O(n^{1/c})$ for
some small constant $c$.
  Our results include:
  -- an algorithm for computing the determinant and the rank of an $n\times n$
matrix using $O(k^3\cdot n)$ time and arithmetic operations;
  -- an algorithm for solving a system of linear equations using $O(k^3\cdot
n)$ time and arithmetic operations;
  -- an $O(k^3\cdot n\log n)$-time randomized algorithm for finding the
cardinality of a maximum matching in a graph;
  -- an $O(k^4\cdot n\log^2 n)$-time randomized algorithm for constructing a
maximum matching in a graph;
  -- an $O(k^2\cdot n\log n)$-time algorithm for finding a maximum vertex flow
in a directed graph.
  Moreover, we give an approximation algorithm for treewidth with time
complexity suited to the running times as above. Namely, the algorithm, when
given a graph $G$ and integer $k$, runs in time $O(k^7\cdot n\log n)$ and
either correctly reports that the treewidth of $G$ is larger than $k$, or
constructs a tree decomposition of $G$ of width $O(k^2)$.

for which material properties not only vary continuously through thickness
according to a power-law distribution but also are assumed to be a function of
temperature. Temperature field is assumed to be constant in any plane and
uniform, linear and nonlinear through plate thickness, respectively. The
governing equation is in nonlinear form based on von Karman assumption and
thermal effect. A NURBS-based isogeometric finite element formulation is
utilized to naturally fulfil the rigorous C1-continuity required by the present

of FGM plate are discussed in details. Numerical results demonstrate excellent

resulting generation of global magnetic fields are controlled by the overlying
rocky mantle. The thermal structure of the lower mantle determines how much
heat is allowed to escape the core. Hot lower mantle features, such as the
thermal footprint of a giant impact or hot mantle plumes, will locally reduce
the heat flux through the core mantle boundary (CMB), thereby weakening core
convection and affecting the magnetic field generation process. In this study,
we numerically investigate how parametrised hot spots at the CMB with arbitrary
sizes, amplitudes, and positions affect core convection and hence the dynamo.
The effect of the heat flux anomaly is quantified by changes in global flow
symmetry properties, such as the emergence of equatorial antisymmetric,
axisymmetric (EAA) zonal flows. For purely hydrodynamic models, the EAA
symmetry scales almost linearly with the CMB amplitude and size, whereas
self-consistent dynamo simulations typically reveal either suppressed or
drastically enhanced EAA symmetry depending mainly on the horizontal extent of
the heat flux anomaly. Our results suggest that the length scale of the anomaly
should be on the same order as the outer core radius to significantly affect
flow and field symmetries. As an implication to Mars and in the range of our
model, the study concludes that an ancient core field modified by a CMB heat
flux anomaly is not able to heterogeneously magnetise the crust to the
present-day level of north--south asymmetry on Mars. The resulting magnetic
fields obtained using our model either are not asymmetric enough or, when they
are asymmetric enough, show rapid polarity inversions, which are incompatible
with thick unidirectional magnetisation.

wave predictability using light. Using the Grassberger-Procaccia embedding
method, we here demonstrate that optical spatial rogue wave data in
photorefractive crystals has the same predictability and dynamic features of
ocean rogue waves. For scales up to the autocorrelation length, a chaotic and
predictable behavior emerges, whereas complexity in the dynamics causes
long-range predictability to be limited by the finite size of data sets. The
appearance of same dynamics validates the conjecture that rogue waves share
universal features across different physical systems, these including their

exponential domination, where vertices are considered to have some dominating
power that decreases exponentially with the distance, and the dominated
vertices have to accumulate a sufficient amount of this power emanating from
the dominating vertices. More precisely, if $S$ is a set of vertices of a graph
$G$, then $S$ is an exponential dominating set of $G$ if $\sum\limits_{v\in
S}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{{\rm dist}_{(G,S)}(u,v)-1}\geq 1$ for every vertex
$u$ in $V(G)\setminus S$, where ${\rm dist}_{(G,S)}(u,v)$ is the distance
between $u\in V(G)\setminus S$ and $v\in S$ in the graph $G-(S\setminus \{
v\})$. The exponential domination number $\gamma_e(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum
order of an exponential dominating set of $G$.
  In the present paper we study exponential domination in subcubic graphs. Our
results are as follows: If $G$ is a connected subcubic graph of order $n(G)$,
then $$\frac{n(G)}{6\log_2(n(G)+2)+4}\leq \gamma_e(G)\leq
\frac{1}{3}(n(G)+2).$$ For every $\epsilon>0$, there is some $g$ such that
$\gamma_e(G)\leq \epsilon n(G)$ for every cubic graph $G$ of girth at least
$g$. For every $0<\alpha<\frac{2}{3\ln(2)}$, there are infinitely many cubic
graphs $G$ with $\gamma_e(G)\leq \frac{3n(G)}{\ln(n(G))^{\alpha}}$. If $T$ is a
subcubic tree, then $\gamma_e(T)\geq \frac{1}{6}(n(T)+2).$ For a given subcubic
tree, $\gamma_e(T)$ can be determined in polynomial time. The minimum
exponential dominating set problem is APX-hard for subcubic graphs.

gradual counterparts to static type disciplines. The approach consists of
defining the semantics of gradual types by interpreting them as sets of static
types, and then defining an optimal abstraction back to gradual types. These
operations are used to lift the static discipline to the gradual setting. The
runtime semantics of the gradual language then arises as reductions on gradual
typing derivations.
  To demonstrate the flexibility of AGT, we gradualize $\lambda_\text{SEC}$,
the prototypical security-typed language, with respect to only security labels
rather than entire types, yielding a type system that ranges gradually from
simply-typed to securely-typed. We establish noninterference for the gradual
language, called $\lambda_{\widetilde{\text{SEC}}}$, using Zdancewic's logical
relation proof method. Whereas prior work presents gradual security cast
languages, which require explicit security casts, this work yields the first
gradual security source language, which requires no explicit casts.

interference between the two association processes activated by the oscillating
terms is controlled via the phase difference. As a result, significant increase
or decrease of the effective interaction strength can be achieved. The
realization of the proposal is feasible under standard technical conditions. In
particular, the method is found to be robust against the effect of the sources
of decoherence present in the practical setup. The applicability of the
approach to deal with quadratic terms in the field modulation is discussed.

fractional order systems by using the coefficient mapping concept to determine
whether the model parameters can uniquely be identified from input-output data.
The proposed method is applicable to general non-commensurate fractional order
models. Examples are chosen from battery fractional order equivalent circuit
models (FO-ECMs). The battery FO-ECM consists of a series of parallel resistors
and constant phase elements (CPEs) with fractional derivatives appearing in the
CPEs. The FO-ECM is non-commensurate if more than one CPE is considered in the
model. Currently, estimation of battery FO-ECMs is performed mainly by fitting
in the frequency domain, requiring costly electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy equipment. This paper aims to analyse the structural
identifiability of battery FO-ECMs directly in the time domain. It is shown
that FO-ECMs with finite numbers of CPEs are structurally identifiable. In
particular, the FO-ECM with a single CPE is structurally globally identifiable.

span of up to 100 hours. The simulation domain extends about 18 Mm in depth
beneath the photosphere and 98 Mm horizontally. We use open boundary conditions
that do not maintain the initial field structure against decay driven by
convective motions. We consider two setups: A sunspot simulation with penumbra,
and a ""naked-spot"" simulation in which we removed the penumbra after 20 hours
through a change in the magnetic top boundary condition. While the sunspot has
an Evershed outflow of 3-4 km/s, the naked spot is surrounded by an inflow of
1-2 km/s in close proximity. However, both spots are surrounded by an outflow
on larger scales with a few 100 m/s flow speed in the photosphere. While the
sunspot has almost constant magnetic flux content for the simulated time span
of 3-4 days, the naked spot decays steadily at a rate of $10^{21}$ Mx/day. A
region with reduced downflow filling factor, which is more extended for the
sunspot, surrounds both spots. The absence of downflows perturbs the
upflow/downflow massflux balance and leads to a large-scale radially
overturning flow system, the photospheric component of this flow is to the
observable moat flow. The reduction of the downflow filling factor also
inhibits submergence of magnetic field in the proximity of the spots, which
stabilizes them against decay. While this effect is present for both spots, it
is more pronounced for the sunspot and explains the almost stationary magnetic
flux content.

auction formats, such as selling m items via simultaneous second price auctions
(SiSPAs) (Christodoulou et al. 2008, Bhawalkar and Roughgarden 2011, Feldman et
al. 2013). These guarantees hold even when the auctions are repeatedly executed
and players use no-regret learning algorithms. Unfortunately, off-the-shelf
no-regret algorithms for these auctions are computationally inefficient as the
number of actions is exponential. We show that this obstacle is insurmountable:
there are no polynomial-time no-regret algorithms for SiSPAs, unless
RP$\supseteq$ NP, even when the bidders are unit-demand. Our lower bound raises
the question of how good outcomes polynomially-bounded bidders may discover in
such auctions.
  To answer this question, we propose a novel concept of learning in auctions,
termed ""no-envy learning."" This notion is founded upon Walrasian equilibrium,
and we show that it is both efficiently implementable and results in
approximately optimal welfare, even when the bidders have fractionally
subadditive (XOS) valuations (assuming demand oracles) or coverage valuations
(without demand oracles). No-envy learning outcomes are a relaxation of
no-regret outcomes, which maintain their approximate welfare optimality while
endowing them with computational tractability. Our results extend to other
auction formats that have been studied in the literature via the smoothness
paradigm.
  Our results for XOS valuations are enabled by a novel
Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader algorithm for settings where the number of experts
is infinite, and the payoff function of the learner is non-linear. This
algorithm has applications outside of auction settings, such as in security
games. Our result for coverage valuations is based on a novel use of convex
rounding schemes and a reduction to online convex optimization.

Using a superconducting parametric amplifier, we have performed heterodyne
detection of the fluorescence of a superconducting qubit. For each realization

for the qubit. The observed evolution obeys quantum state diffusion, which is
characteristic of quantum measurements subject to zero point fluctuations.
Independent projective measurements of the qubit at various times provide a
quantitative validation of the reconstructed trajectories. By exploring the
statistics of quantum trajectories, we demonstrate that the qubit states span a
deterministic surface in the Bloch sphere at each time in the evolution.
Additionally, we show that when monitoring fluorescence, coherent
superpositions are generated during the decay from excited to ground state.
Counterintuitively, measuring light emitted during relaxation can give rise to
trajectories with increased excitation probability.

which ended up as compact configurations form chains of mean motion resonances
(MMRs) of the first and higher orders. Most of the systems involved in chains
of MMRs are periodic configurations. The period ratios of such system, though,
are not necessarily close to exact commensurability. If a given system resides
in a divergent migration zone in the disc, the period ratios increase and
evolve along resonant divergent migration paths at ($P_2/P_1,
P_3/P_2)$-diagram, where $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are the orbital periods of the first,
second and third planet, respectively. The observed systems, though, do not lie
on those paths. We show that an agreement between the synthetic and the

Therefore, we conclude that most of those systems unlikely formed as a result

supersymmetric theories. Often from the study of BPS states one can infer
properties of the geometrical or algebraic structures underlying such theories.
In this paper we approach this problem from the perspective of persistent
homology. Persistent homology is at the base of topological data analysis,
which aims at extracting topological features out of a set of points. We use
these techniques to investigate the topological properties which characterize
the spectra of several supersymmetric models in field and string theory. We
discuss how such features change upon crossing walls of marginal stability in a
few examples. Then we look at the topological properties of the distributions
of BPS invariants in string compactifications on compact threefolds, used to
engineer black hole microstates. Finally we discuss the interplay between
persistent homology and modularity by considering certain number theoretical
functions used to count dyons in string compactifications and by studying
equivariant elliptic genera in the context of the Mathieu moonshine.

microquasars towards the Galactic center region whose X-ray states strongly
resemble those of Cygnus X-1. Yet, the bipolar radio jets of 1E 1740.7-2942 are
very reminiscent of a radio galaxy. The true nature of the object has thus
remained an open question for nearly a quarter of a century. Aims. Our main
goal here is to confirm the Galactic membership of 1E 1740.7-2942 by searching
for morphological changes of its extended radio jets in human timescales. This
work was triggered as a result of recent positive detection of fast structural
changes in the large-scale jets of its 'twin' GRS 1758-258. Methods. We carried
out an in-depth exploration of the VLA public archives and fully recalibrated
all 1E 1740.7-2942 extended data sets in the C configuration of the array. We
obtained and analyzed matching beam radio maps for five epochs, covering years
1992, 1993, 1994, 1997 and 2000, with an angular resolution of a few
arcseconds. Results. We clearly detected structural changes in the arcminute
jets of 1E 1740.7-2942 on timescales of roughly a year, which set a firm
distance upper limit of 12 kpc. Moreover, a simple precessing model was
simultaneously fitted to the five observing epochs available. The observed
changes in the jet flow are strongly suggestive of a precession period of ~1.3
years. Conclusions. The fitting of the precession model to the data yields a
distance of ~5 kpc. This value, and the observed changes, rule out any
remaining doubts about the 1E 1740.7-2942 Galactic nature. To our knowledge,
this microquasar is the second whose jet precession ephemeris become available
after SS433. This kind of information is relevant to the physics of compact
objects, since the genesis of the precession phenomenon occurs very close to
the interplay region between the accretion disk and the compact object in the
system.

1.4, and 3 mm using the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer in the framework of
the CALYPSO large program. We clearly disentangle for the first time the
outflow emission from the two sources A1 and A2. The two protostellar jets have
very different properties: the A1 jet is faster, has a short dynamical
timescale (<10^3 yr), and is associated with H2 shocked emission, whereas the
A2 jet, which dominates the large-scale emission, is associated with diffuse
emission, bends, and emits at slower velocities. The observed bending of the A2
jet is consistent with the change of propagation direction observed at large
scale and suggests jet precession on very short timescales (~200-600 yr). In
addition, a chemically rich spectrum with emission from several COMs (e.g.
HCOOH, CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3) is only detected towards A2. Finally, very
high-velocity shocked emission (~50 km s^-1) is observed along the A1 jet. An
LTE analysis shows that SiO, SO, and H2CO abundances in the gas phase are
enhanced up to (3-4)x10^{-7}, (1.4-1.7)x10^{-6}, and (3-7.9)x10^{-7},
respectively. The intrinsic different properties of the jets and driving
sources in NGC1333-IRAS4A suggest different evolutionary stages for the two
protostars, with A1 being younger than A2, in a very early stage of star
formation previous to the hot-corino phase.

holes into intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of $\gtrsim 100$ solar masses
represent one of the exciting possible sources for advanced gravitational-wave
detectors. These sources can provide definitive evidence for the existence of
IMBHs, probe globular-cluster dynamics, and potentially serve as tests of
general relativity. We analyse the accuracy with which we can measure the
masses and spins of the IMBH and its companion in intermediate-mass ratio
coalescences. We find that we can identify an IMBH with a mass above $100 ~
M_\odot$ with $95\%$ confidence provided the massive body exceeds $130 ~
M_\odot$. For source masses above $\sim200 ~ M_\odot$, the best measured
parameter is the frequency of the quasi-normal ringdown. Consequently, the
total mass is measured better than the chirp mass for massive binaries, but the
total mass is still partly degenerate with spin, which cannot be accurately
measured. Low-frequency detector sensitivity is particularly important for
massive sources, since sensitivity to the inspiral phase is critical for
measuring the mass of the stellar-mass companion. We show that we can
accurately infer source parameters for cosmologically redshifted signals by
applying appropriate corrections. We investigate the impact of uncertainty in
the model gravitational waveforms and conclude that our main results are likely

kinetic simulations. For an ion-electron plasma with the total magnetization
$\sigma_0=B^2/(4\pi n(m_i+m_e)c^2)$, the magnetization for each species is
$\sigma_i \sim \sigma_0$ and $\sigma_e \sim (m_i/m_e) \sigma_0$, respectively.
We have studied the magnetically dominated regime by varying $\sigma_{e} = 10^3
- 10^5$ with initial ion and electron temperatures $T_i = T_e = 5 - 20 m_ec^2$
and mass ratio $m_i/m_e = 1 - 1836$. The results demonstrate that reconnection
quickly establishes power-law energy distributions for both electrons and ions
within several ($2-3$) light-crossing times. For the cases with periodic
boundary conditions, the power-law index is $1<s<2$ for both electrons and
ions. The hard spectra limit the power-law energies for electrons and ions to
be $\gamma_{be} \sim \sigma_e$ and $\gamma_{bi} \sim \sigma_i$, respectively.
The main acceleration mechanism is a Fermi-like acceleration through the drift
motions of charged particles. When comparing the spectra for electrons and ions
in momentum space, the spectral indices $s_p$ are identical as predicted in
Fermi acceleration. We also find that the bulk flow can carry a significant
amount of energy during the simulations. We discuss the implication of this

alternative way of performing Bayesian updates, called particle flow filters,

solutions to nonlinear filtering problems. They do so by defining a continuum
of densities between the prior probability density and the posterior, i.e. the
filtering density. Building on these methods' successes, we propose a novel
filter. The new filter aims to address the shortcomings of sequential Monte
Carlo methods when applied to important nonlinear high-dimensional filtering
problems. The novel filter uses equally weighted samples, each of which is
associated with a local solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. This hybrid of
Monte Carlo and local parametric approximation gives rise to a global
approximation of the filtering density of interest. We show that, when compared
with state-of-the-art methods, the Gaussian-mixture implementation of the new

wavelength mode is implemented using an effective curved cosmology and a
mapping of time and distances. The method provides an alternative, most
probably more precise, way to measure the isotropic halo biases. Limiting
ourselves to the linear case, we find generally good agreement between the
biases obtained from the curvature method and the traditional power spectrum
method at the level of a few percent. We also study the response of halo counts
to changes in the variance of the field and find that the slope of the relation
between the responses to density and variance differs from the naive derivation
assuming a universal mass function by 18%. This has implications for
measurements of the amplitude of local non-Gaussianity using scale dependent
bias. We also analyze the halo power spectrum and halo-dark matter
cross-spectrum response to long wavelength fluctuations and derive second order
halo bias from it, as well as the super-sample variance contribution to the
galaxy power spectrum covariance matrix.

exterior the the channel. The channels in these systems may undergo peristaltic
pumping which is thought to enhance the material exchange. To date, little
analytic work has been done to study the effect of pumping on material
extraction across the channel walls. In this paper, we examine a fluid
extraction model in which fluid flowing through a leaky channel is exchanged
with fluid in a reservoir. The channel walls are allowed to contract and expand
uniformly, simulating a pumping mechanism. In order to efficiently determine
solutions of the model, we derive a formal power series solution for the Stokes
equations in a finite channel with uniformly contracting/expanding permeable
walls. This flow has been well studied in the case of weakly permeable channel
walls in which the normal velocity at the channel walls is proportional to the
wall velocity. In contrast we do not assume weakly driven flow, but flow driven
by hydrostatic pressure, and we use Dacry's law to close our system for normal
wall velocity. We use our flow solution to examine flux across the
channel-reservoir barrier and demonstrate that pumping can either enhance or
impede fluid extraction across channel walls. We find that associated with each
set of physical flow and pumping parameters, there are optimal reservoir
conditions that maximizes the amount of material flowing from the channel into
the reservoir.

supernovae (SESNe) is due to a long lasting accretion process onto the newly
born neutron star (NS), resulting from an inefficient operation of the
jet-feedback mechanism. The jets that are launched by the accreting NS or black
hole (BH) maintain their axis due to a rapidly rotating pre-collapse core, and
do not manage to eject core material from near the equatorial plane. The jets
are able to eject material from the core along the polar directions, and reduce
the gravity near the equatorial plane. The equatorial gas expands, and part of
it falls back over a timescale of minutes to days to prolong the jets-launching
episode. According to the model for SESNe proposed in the present paper, the
principal parameter that distinguishes between the different cases of CCSN
explosions, such as between normal CCSNe and SESNe, is the efficiency of the
jet-feedback mechanism. This efficiency in turn depends on the pre-collapse
core mass, envelope mass, core convection, and most of all on the angular
momentum profile in the core. One prediction of the inefficient jet-feedback
mechanism for SESNe is the formation of a slow equatorial outflow in the
explosion. Typical velocity and mass of this outflow are estimated to be
approximately 1000 km/s and greater than about 1 solar mass, respectively,
though quantitative values will have to be checked in future hydrodynamic
simulations.

for studying clustering and community detection. In an exciting sequence of
developments, motivated by deep but non-rigorous ideas from statistical
physics, Decelle et al. conjectured a sharp threshold for when community
detection is possible in the sparse regime. Mossel, Neeman and Sly and
Massoulie proved the conjecture and gave matching algorithms and lower bounds.
  Here we revisit the stochastic block model from the perspective of semirandom
models where we allow an adversary to make `helpful' changes that strengthen
ties within each community and break ties between them. We show a surprising
result that these `helpful' changes can shift the information-theoretic
threshold, making the community detection problem strictly harder. We
complement this by showing that an algorithm based on semidefinite programming
(which was known to get close to the threshold) continues to work in the
semirandom model (even for partial recovery). This suggests that algorithms
based on semidefinite programming are robust in ways that any algorithm meeting
the information-theoretic threshold cannot be.
  These results point to an interesting new direction: Can we find robust,
semirandom analogues to some of the classical, average-case thresholds in
statistics? We also explore this question in the broadcast tree model, and we
show that the viewpoint of semirandom models can help explain why some
algorithms are preferred to others in practice, in spite of the gaps in their
statistical performance on random models.

laminar-turbulent bands of transitional plane Couette flow under the influence
of turbulent noise. Our study is focused on the amplitude of modulation of
turbulence. In order to guide the numerical study of the flow, we first perform
an analytical and numerical analysis of a Stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation
for a complex order parameter. The modulus of this order parameter models the
amplitude of modulation of turbulence. Firstly, we compute the autocorrelation
function of said modulus once the band is established. Secondly, we perform a
calculation of average and fluctuations around the exponential growth of the
order parameter. This type of analysis is similar to the Stochastic Structural
Stability Theory. We then perform numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes
equations in order to confront these predictions with the actual behaviour of
the bands. Computation of the autocorrelation function of the modulation of
turbulence shows quantitative agreement with the model: in the established band
regime, the amplitude of modulation follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. In
order to test the S3T predictions, we perform quench experiments, sudden
decreases of the Reynolds number from uniform turbulence, in which modulation
appears. We compute the average evolution of the amplitude of modulation and
the fluctuations around it. We find good agreement between numerics and
modeling. The average trajectory grows exponentially, at a rate clearly smaller
than that of the formation of laminar holes. The actual time evolution remains
in a flaring envelope, centred on the average, and expanding at the same rate.
These results provide further validation of the stochastic modeling for the
time evolution of the bands for further studies. They stress on the difference
between the oblique band formation and the formation of laminar holes.

faintest isolated dwarfs in and around the Local Group, such as Leo T and the
recently discovered Leo P and Pisces A systems. Using new numerical
simulations, we show that this serious challenge to our understanding of galaxy
formation can be effectively resolved by taking into account the regulating
influence of the ultraviolet radiation of the first population of stars on a
dwarf's star formation rate while otherwise staying within the standard
cosmological paradigm for structure formation. These simulations produce faint,
gas-dominated, star-forming dwarf galaxies that lie on the baryonic
Tully-Fisher relation and that successfully reproduce a broad range of
chemical, kinematical, and structural observables of real late-type dwarf
galaxies. Furthermore, we stress the importance of obtaining properties of
simulated galaxies in a manner as close as possible to the typically employed
observational techniques.

of the spectral lines, i.e., macroturbulence, across most of the HR diagram.
When considering the locations in the HR diagram where we expect high-order

find a close match with the observational $\gamma$ Doradus instability strip,

obtain resolved spectroscopy over a wide wavelength range of 3,600-10,300A. To
map the internal variations within each galaxy, we need to perform accurate
{\it spectral surface photometry}, which is to calibrate the specific intensity
at every spatial location sampled by each individual aperture element of the
integral field unit. The calibration must correct only for the flux loss due to
atmospheric throughput and the instrument response, but not for losses due to
the finite geometry of the fiber aperture. This requires the use of standard
star measurements to strictly separate these two flux loss factors (throughput
versus geometry), a difficult challenge with standard single-fiber spectroscopy
techniques due to various practical limitations. Therefore, we developed a
technique for spectral surface photometry using multiple small fiber-bundles
targeting standard stars simultaneously with galaxy observations. We discuss
the principles of our approach and how they compare to previous efforts, and we
demonstrate the precision and accuracy achieved. MaNGA's relative calibration

particular emphasis on the fully frustrated case. We present numerical results
for the magnetic specific heat and susceptibility, obtained from exact
diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo studies, which we show can be rendered

us to reach unprecedented sizes of L=200 ladder rungs. We find that frustration
effects cause an unconventional evolution of the thermodynamic response across
the full parameter regime of the model. However, close to the first-order
transition they cause a highly anomalous reduction in temperature scales with
no concomitant changes in the gap; the specific heat shows a very narrow peak
at very low energies and the susceptibility rises abruptly at extremely low

of deconfined `anyon' excitations that have exotic braiding and exchange
statistics, different from those of ordinary bosons or fermions. As opposed to
conventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson phases, which are classified on the basis
of the spontaneous breaking of an underlying symmetry, topologically ordered
phases, such as those occurring in the fractional quantum Hall effect, are
absolutely stable, not requiring any such symmetry. Recently, though, it has
been realized that symmetries, which may still be present in such systems, can
give rise to a host of new, distinct, many-body phases, all of which share the
same underlying topological order. A useful approach to classifying SETs is to
determine all possible such symmetry actions on the anyons that are
algebraically consistent with the anyons' statistics. Remarkably, however,
there exist symmetry actions that, despite being algebraically consistent,
cannot be realized in any physical system, and hence do not lead to valid 2d
SETs. One class of such `anomalous' SETs, characterized by certain disallowed
symmetry fractionalization patters, finds a physical interpretation as an
allowed surface state of certain 3d short-range entangled phases, but another,
characterized by some seemingly valid but anomalous permutation actions of the
symmetry on the anyons, has so far eluded a physical interpretation. In this
work, we find a physical realization for these anomalously permuting SETs as
surface theories of certain 3d long-range entangled phases, completing our
understanding of general anomalous SETs in 2 dimensions.

energy and momentum Coulomb interaction. We demonstrate that at sufficiently
small values $|\varepsilon (\pi ,0)-E_{F}|\lesssim \Gamma $, where $E_{F}$ is
the Fermi energy, $\varepsilon \left( \pi ,0\right) $ is the energy in the
middle of the Brillouin zone edge, and $\Gamma $ is a characteristic energy of
the fermion-fermion interaction due to the antiferromagnetic fluctuations, the
leading particle-hole instability is a d-form factor Fermi surface deformation
(Pomeranchuk instability) rather than the charge modulation along the Brillouin
zone diagonals predicted within the standard SF model previously. At lower
temperatures, we find that the deformed Fermi surface is further unstable to
formation of a d-form factor charge density wave (CDW) with a wave vector along
the Cu-O-Cu bonds (axes of the Brillouin zone). We show that the remnant
Coulomb interaction enhances the d-form factor symmetry of the CDW. These
findings can explain the robustness of this order in the cuprates. The
approximations made in the paper are justified by a small parameter that allows
one an Eliashberg-like treatment. Comparison with experiments suggests that in

Previous studies found a characteristic bubble size which increases rapidly
during reionization, with apparent agreement between simulations and analytic
excursion set theory. Using four different methods, we critically examine this
claim. In particular, we introduce the use of the watershed algorithm -- widely
used for void finding in galaxy surveys -- which we show to be an unbiased
method with the lowest dispersion and best performance on Monte-Carlo
realizations of a known bubble size PDF. We find that a friends-of-friends
algorithm declares most of the ionized volume to be occupied by a network of
volume-filling regions connected by narrow tunnels. For methods tuned to detect
the volume-filling regions, previous apparent agreement between simulations and
theory is spurious, and due to a failure to correctly account for the window
function of measurement schemes. The discrepancy is already obvious from visual
inspection. Instead, HII regions in simulations are significantly larger (by
factors of 10-1000 in volume) than analytic predictions. The size PDF is
narrower, and evolves more slowly with time, than predicted. It becomes more
sharply peaked as reionization progresses. These effects are likely caused by
bubble mergers, which are inadequately modeled by analytic theory. Our results
have important consequences for high-redshift 21cm observations, the mean free
path of ionizing photons, and the visibility of Ly-alpha emitters, and point to
a fundamental failure in our understanding of the characteristic scales of the

whose masses range from 1e+14 Msun to 5e+14 Msun. Masses and sizes of stellar
bulges are also assumed to satisfy the stellar mass--size relation of high-z

considerably contribute to the mass and size growth of central massive

quadruple the average size between $z=2$ and $z=0$. These growths favorably
agree with observations. Moreover, the density distributions of our simulated
central massive galaxies grow from the inside-out, which is consistent with
recent observations. The mass--size evolution is approximated as R propto
M_{*}^{alpha}, with alpha ~ 2.24. Most of our simulated galaxies are
efficiently grown by dry mergers, and their stellar mass--size relations match

surface hydrophobicity; the easier it is to displace the interfacial waters,
the more hydrophobic the underlying surface. However, characterizing the free
energetics of such rare fluctuations requires computationally expensive,
non-Boltzmann sampling methods like umbrella sampling. This inherent
computational expense associated with umbrella sampling makes it challenging to
investigate the role of polarizability or electronic structure effects in
influencing interfacial fluctuations. Importantly, it also limits the size of
the volume, which can be used to probe interfacial fluctuations. The latter can
be particularly important in characterizing the hydrophobicity of large
surfaces with molecular-level heterogeneities, such as those presented by
proteins. To overcome these challenges, here we present a method for the sparse
sampling of water density fluctuations, which is roughly two orders of
magnitude more efficient than umbrella sampling. We employ thermodynamic
integration to estimate the free energy differences between biased ensembles,
thereby circumventing the umbrella sampling requirement of overlap between
adjacent biased distributions. Further, a judicious choice of the biasing
potential allows such free energy differences to be estimated using short
simulations, so that the free energetics of water density fluctuations are
obtained using only a few, short simulations. Leveraging the efficiency of the
method, we characterize water density fluctuations in the entire hydration

(LAEs) at $5.7<z<7$. These galaxies have deep optical and infrared images from
Subaru, $HST$, and $Spitzer$/IRAC. We focus on a subset of 27 galaxies with
IRAC detections, and characterize their stellar populations utilizing galaxy
synthesis models based on the multi-band data and secure redshifts. By
incorporating nebular emission estimated from the observed Ly$\alpha$ flux, we
are able to break the strong degeneracy of model spectra between young galaxies
with prominent nebular emission and older galaxies with strong Balmer breaks.
The results show that our galaxies cover a wide range of ages from several to a
few hundred million years (Myr), and a wide range of stellar masses from
$\sim10^8$ to $\sim10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$. These galaxies can be roughly divided
into an `old' subsample and a `young' subsample. The `old' subsample consists
of galaxies older than 100 Myr, with stellar masses higher than $10^9$
$M_{\odot}$. The galaxies in the `young' subsample are younger than $\sim$30
Myr, with masses ranging between $\sim10^8$ and $\sim3\times10^9$ $M_{\odot}$.
Both subsamples display a correlation between stellar mass and star-formation
rate (SFR), but with very different normalizations. The average specific SFR
(sSFR) of the `old' subsample is 3--4 Gyr$^{-1}$, consistent with previous
studies of `normal' star-forming galaxies at $z\ge6$. The average sSFR of the
`young' subsample is an order of magnitude higher, likely due to starburst
activity. Our results also indicate little or no dust extinction in the
majority of the galaxies, as already suggested by their steep rest-frame UV
slopes. Finally, LAEs and LBGs with strong Ly$\alpha$ emission are
indistinguishable in terms of age, stellar mass, and SFR.

intermediate-band photometry; it is the first such attempt targeting a sample
of 13 quasars at $0.2<z<0.9$. The quasars were selected to have strong
H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ emission lines that are located in one of three
intermediate bands (with FWHM around 200 \AA) centered at 8045, 8505, and 9171
\AA. The imaging observations were carried out in the intermediate bands and
the broad $i$ and $z$ bands using the prime-focus imager 90Prime on the 2.3m
Bok telescope. Because of the large ($\sim$1 deg$^2$) field-of-view (FoV) of
90Prime, we were able to include the 13 quasars within only five telescope
pointings or fields. The five fields were repeatedly observed over 20--30
epochs that were unevenly distributed over a duration of 5--6 months. The
combination of the broad- and intermediate-band photometry allows us to derive
accurate light curves for both optical continuum (from the accretion disk) and
line (from the broad-line region, or BLR) emission. We detect H$\alpha$ time
lags between the continuum and line emission in 6 quasars. These quasars are at
a relatively low redshift range $0.2<z<0.4$. The measured lags are consistent
with the current BLR size-luminosity relation for H$\beta$ at $z<0.3$. While
this experiment appears successful in detecting lags of the bright H$\alpha$
line, further investigation is required to see if it can also be applied to the
fainter H$\beta$ line for quasars at higher redshifts. Finally we demonstrate
that by using a small telescope with a large FoV, intermediate-band photometric
RM can be efficiently executed for a large sample of quasars at $z>0.2$.

the intergalactic medium is divided into just two regions, one ionized and one
neutral, and both infinite in extent. We also show that the discrete ionized
regions that exist before and near this transition point follow a near-power
law distribution in volume, with equal contributions to the total filling
factor per logarithmic interval in size up to a sharp cutoff in volume. These
qualities are generic to percolation processes, with the detailed behavior a
result of long-range correlations in the underlying density field. These
insights will be crucial to understanding the distribution of ionized and

decision-making behaviour. It is generally assumed that high-resolution data
are needed to extract meaningful behavioural patterns, which potentially limits
the application of this approach. Obtaining high-resolution movement data
continues to be an economic and technical challenge, particularly for animals
that live in social groups. Here, we test whether accurate movement behaviour
can be extracted from data that possesses increasingly lower temporal
resolution. To do so, we use a modified version of force matching, in which
simulated forces acting on a focal animal are compared to observed movement
data. We show that useful information can be extracted from sparse data. We
apply this approach to a sparse movement dataset collected on the adult members
of a troop of baboons in the DeHoop Nature Reserve, South Africa. We use these
data to test the hypothesis that individuals are sensitive to isolation from
the group as a whole or, alternatively, whether they are sensitive to the
location of specific individuals within the group. Using data from a focal
animal, our data provide support for both hypothesis, with stronger support for
the latter. Although the focal animal was found to be sensitive to the group,
this occurred only on a small number of occasions when the group as a whole was
highly clustered as a single entity away from the focal animal. We suggest that
specific social interactions may thus drive overall group cohesion. Given that
sparse movement data is informative about individual movement behaviour, we
suggest that both high (~seconds) and relatively low (~minutes) resolution
datasets are valuable for the study of how individuals react to and manipulate
their local social and ecological environments.

the map equation and evades the reconstruction step. This makes it possible to
efficiently analyze large networks at different Markov times with no extra
overhead cost. The method also evades the costly unipartite projection for
identifying flow modules in bipartite networks.

necessary to eliminate the subtree rooted at $v$. A branch is a group of
neighboring vertices and edges of the same order. The Horton numbers $N_k[K]$

  This paper presents the performance analysis and optimization of the spectral
element version of NUMA. The performance at different optimization stages is
analyzed using a theoretical performance model as well as measurements via
hardware counters. Machine independent optimization is compared to machine
specific optimization using BG/Q vector intrinsics. By using vector intrinsics
the main computations reach 1.2 PFlops on the entire machine Mira (12% of the
theoretical peak performance). The paper also presents scalability studies for
two idealized test cases that are relevant for NWP applications. The
atmospheric model NUMA delivers an excellent strong scaling efficiency of 99%
on the entire supercomputer Mira using a mesh with 1.8 billion grid points.
This allows to run a global forecast of a baroclinic wave test case at 3km
uniform horizontal resolution and double precision within the time frame
required for operational weather prediction.

and develop the LArTPC (Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber) detector
technology. The MicroBooNE experiment, which began taking data this year, is
the first large LArTPC detector in the U.S. This experiment is the beginning of
a path of detectors (both on the surface and underground) envisioned for the
U.S. SBL (Short-BaseLine) and LBL (Long-BaseLine) programs. In order to
interpret the data from the experiments on the surface, the impact of space
charge effects must be simulated and calibrated. The space charge effect is the
build-up of slow-moving positive ions in a detector due to, for instance,
ionization from cosmic rays, leading to a distortion of the electric field
within the detector. This effect leads to a displacement in the reconstructed
position of signal ionization electrons in LArTPC detectors. The LArTPC
utilized in the MicroBooNE experiment is expected to be modestly impacted from
the space charge effect, with the electric field magnitude changing by roughly
5\% (at a drift field of 500 V/cm) in some locations within the TPC. We discuss
the simulation of the space charge effect at MicroBooNE as well as calibration
techniques that make use of a UV laser system and cosmic muon events. A
successful calibration of the space charge effect is imperative both to the
success of the MicroBooNE physics program as well as to the development of
LArTPC technology for future experiments.

every molecule in its course', has been the centre of much debate about its
abilities to violate the second law of thermodynamics. Landauer's hypothesis,
that the Demon must erase its memory and incur a thermodynamic cost, has become
the standard response to Maxwell's dilemma, and its implications for the
thermodynamics of computation reach into many areas of quantum and classical
computing. It remains, however, still a hypothesis. Debate has often centred
around simple toy models of a single particle in a box. Despite their
simplicity, the ability of these systems to accurately represent thermodynamics
(specifically to satisfy the second law) and whether or not they display
Landauer Erasure, has been a matter of ongoing argument. The recent
Norton-Ladyman controversy is one such example.
  In this paper we introduce a programming language to describe these simple
thermodynamic processes, and give a formal operational semantics and program
logic as a basis for formal reasoning about thermodynamic systems. We formalise
the basic single-particle operations as statements in the language, and then
show that the second law must be satisfied by any composition of these basic
operations. This is done by finding a computational invariant of the system. We
show, furthermore, that this invariant requires an erasure cost to exist within
the system, equal to kTln2 for a bit of information: Landauer Erasure becomes a
theorem of the formal system. The Norton-Ladyman controversy can therefore be
resolved in a rigorous fashion, and moreover the formalism we introduce gives a
set of reasoning tools for further analysis of Landauer erasure, which are
provably consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.

  Being able to train on held-out data is important in practical situations

is also less constrained than the previous training algorithm using
leave-one-out on training data: it allows the use of richer meta-features in
the adjustment model, e.g. the diversity counts used by Kneser-Ney smoothing
which would be difficult to deal with correctly in leave-one-out training.
  In experiments on the one billion words language modeling benchmark, we are
able to slightly improve on our previous results which use a different loss
function, and employ leave-one-out training on a subset of the main training
set. Surprisingly, an adjustment model with meta-features that discard all
lexical information can perform as well as lexicalized meta-features. We find
that fairly small amounts of held-out data (on the order of 30-70 thousand
words) are sufficient for training the adjustment model.
  In a real-life scenario where the training data is a mix of data sources that
are imbalanced in size, and of different degrees of relevance to the held-out

feature and combining them for best performance on held-out/test data improves
over skip-/n-gram SNM models trained on pooled data by about 8% in the SMT

the nature of the IR background is still lacking in the literature. Here we
explore the constraints that can be placed on particle decays, especially
candidate dark matter models involving axions that trace dark matter halos of
galaxies. Axions with a mass around a few eV will decay via two photons with
wavelengths in the near-IR band, and will leave a signature in the IR
background intensity power spectrum. Using recent power spectra measurements
from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment
(CIBER), we find that the 0.6 to 1.6 micron power spectra can be explained by
axions with masses around 4 eV. The total axion abundance Omega_a~0.05, and it
is comparable to the baryon density of the Universe. The suggested mean axion
mass and abundance are not ruled out by existing cosmological observations.
Interestingly, the axion model with a mass distribution is preferred by the

derived from the Ising model) not having an exponential decay of the
correlations is presented. Because of the lack of exponential decay, for such
potentials we have the absence of the spectral gap for the Ruelle operator. The
key idea to prove the lack of exponential decay of the correlations are the
Griffiths-Kelly-Sherman inequalities.

Bootes field (~10 times larger than z~1 luminosity function studies in the
prior literature), we have accurately measured the evolving B-band luminosity
function of red galaxies at z<1.2 and blue galaxies at z<1.0. In addition to
the large sample size, we utilise photometry that accounts for the varying
angular sizes of galaxies, photometric redshifts verified with spectroscopy,
and absolute magnitudes that should have very small random and systematic
errors. Our results are consistent with the migration of galaxies from the blue
cloud to the red sequence as they cease to form stars, and with downsizing in
which more massive and luminous blue galaxies cease star formation earlier than
fainter less massive ones. Comparing the observed fading of red galaxies with
that to be expected from passive evolution alone, we find that the stellar mass
contained within the red galaxy population has increased by a factor of ~3.6
from z~1.1 to z~0.1. The bright end of the red galaxy luminosity function fades
with decreasing redshift, the rate of fading increasing from ~0.2 mag per unit
redshift at z = 1.0 to ~0.8 at z = 0.2. The overall decrease in luminosity
implies that the stellar mass in individual highly luminous red galaxies
increased by a factor of ~2.2 from z = 1.1 to z = 0.1.

mysterious. Here we suggest that observations on polarization evolution of
early optical afterglows may shed light on these questions. We first study the
dynamics of a reverse shock and a forward shock that are generated during the
interaction of a relativistic jet and its ambient medium. The jet is likely
magnetized with a globally large-scale magnetic field from the central engine.
The existence of the reverse shock requires that the magnetization degree of
the jet should not be high ($\sigma\leq 1$), so that the jet is mainly composed
of baryons and leptons. We then calculate the light curve and polarization
evolution of an early optical afterglow, and find that when the polarization
position angle changes by $90^\circ$ during the early afterglow, the
polarization degree is zero for a toroidal magnetic field but is very likely to
be non-zero for an aligned magnetic field. This result would be expected to
provide a probe for the central engine of GRBs, because an aligned field
configuration could originate from a magnetar central engine and a toroidal
field configuration could be produced from a black hole via the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism. Finally, for such two kinds of magnetic field
configurations, we fit the observed data of the early optical afterglow of GRB
120308A equally well.

one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanomaterial has received intensive research
interests. Recently, a new ultra-thin diamond nanothread (DNT) has joined this
palette, which is a 1D structure with poly-benzene sections connected by
Stone-Wales (SW) transformation defects. Using large-scale molecular dynamics
simulations, we found that this sp3 bonded DNT can transit from a brittle to a
ductile characteristic by varying the length of the poly-benzene sections,
suggesting that DNT possesses entirely different mechanical responses than
other 1D carbon allotropies. Analogously, the SW defects behave like a grain
boundary that interrupts the consistency of the poly-benzene sections. For a
DNT with a fixed length, the yield strength fluctuates in the vicinity of a
certain value and is independent of the ""grain size"". On the other hand, both
yield strength and yield strain show a clear dependence on the total length of
DNT, which is due to the fact that the failure of the DNT is dominated by the
SW defects. Its highly tunable ductility together with its ultra-light density
and high Young's modulus makes diamond nanothread ideal for creation of
extremely strong three-dimensional nano-architectures.

richer thermal transport characteristics. There is a transition from
wave-dominated to particle-dominated transport region, which depends on the
length of poly-benzene rings. However, independent of the transport region,
strong length dependence in thermal conductivity is observed in DNTs with
different lengths of poly-benzene ring. The distinctive SW characteristic in
DNT provides more degrees of freedom to tune the thermal conductivity not found
in the homogeneous structure of CNT. Therefore, DNT is an ideal platform to
investigate various thermal transport mechanisms at the nanoscale. Its high

$z=5.944 \pm 0.002$ and rest-frame ultraviolet continuum magnitude
$M_{1450}=-23.59\pm0.10$ AB mag. The discovery of IMS J220417.92+011144.8 is

laboratories, demonstrating an interesting property that the wave shapes are
stable even in the nonlinear regime. The ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model
predicts that an Alfv\'en wave keeps an arbitrary shape constant when it
propagates on a homogeneous ambient magnetic field. However, such arbitrariness
is an artifact of the idealized model that omits the dispersive effects. Only
special wave forms, consisting of two component sinusoidal functions, can
maintain the shape; we derive fully nonlinear Alfv\'en waves by an extended MHD
model that includes both the Hall and electron inertia effects. Interestingly,
these \small-scale effects"" change the picture completely; the large-scale
component of the wave cannot be independent of the small scale component, and
the coexistence of them forbids the large scale component to have a free wave
form. This is a manifestation of the nonlinearity-dispersion interplay, which
is somewhat different from that of solitons.

eruption of a filament caused a blowout jet, and then an M4.0 class flare
occurred. This flare was located at the edge of AR instead of in the core
region. The flare was close to the apparently ""open"" fields, appearing as
extreme-ultraviolet structures that fan out rapidly. Due to the interaction
between flare materials and ""open"" fields, the flare became an eruptive flare,
leading to the CME. Then at the same site of the first eruption, another small
filament erupted. With the high spatial and temporal resolution H$\alpha$ data
from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope at the \emph{Fuxian Solar Observatory}, we
investigate the interaction between the second filament and the nearby ""open""

our knowledge, the detailed process of this kind of interaction is reported for
the first time. Then the new system rotated due to the untwisting motion of the
filament, implying that the twist was transferred from the closed filament
system to the ""open"" system. In addition, the twist seemed to propagate from
the lower atmosphere to the upper layers, and was eventually spread by the CME
to the interplanetary space.

The controversy has been continuing because of our lack of routine measurements

However, recently an indirect method was proposed to infer the magnetic field
configuration based on the sign of helicity and the bearing direction of the
filament barbs. In this paper, we apply this method to two erupting filament

the first filament is supported by a magnetic flux rope and the second filament
is supported by a sheared arcade, i.e., the first one is an inverse-polarity
filament and the second one is a normal-polarity filament. With the

that a flux rope is not a necessary condition for the pre-CME structure.

LCA using the logistic density and a semi-parametric LCA using tilted Gaussians

are recovered that are discarded by PCA+ICA methods. We apply our method to

Their jets are fighting their way through the surrounding gaseous medium,
strongly experiencing this interaction while, at the same time, impacting and
affecting the interstellar medium (ISM). Here we present the results from two
studies of HI (in absorption) and molecular gas illustrating what can be
learned from these phases of the gas. We first describe a statistical study
with the WSRT. The study shows that the young radio sources not only have an
higher detection rate of HI, but also systematically broader and more
asymmetric HI profiles, most of them blueshifted. This supports the idea that
we are looking at young radio jets making their way through the surrounding
ISM, which also appears to be, on average, richer in gas than in evolved radio
sources. Signatures of the impact of the jet are seen in the kinematics of the
gas. However, even among the young sources, we identify a population that
remains undetected in HI even after stacking their profiles. Orientation
effects can only partly explain the result. These objects either are genuinely
gas-poor or have different conditions of the medium, e.g. higher spin
temperature. We further present the ALMA study of molecular gas in IC5063 to
trace in detail the jet impacting the ISM. The kinematics of the cold,
molecular gas co-spatial with the radio plasma shows this process in action.
The ALMA data reveal a fast outflow of molecular gas extending along the entire
radio jet (~1 kpc), with the highest outflow velocities at the location of the
brighter hot-spot. We propose a scenario where the radio jet is expanding into
a clumpy medium, interacting directly with the clouds and inflating a cocoon

image plane motion of pixels, or optical flow. However, objects that are at
different depths from the camera can exhibit different optical flows even if
they share the same real-world motion. This can cause a depth-dependent
segmentation of the scene. Our goal is to develop a segmentation algorithm that
clusters pixels that have similar real-world motion irrespective of their depth
in the scene. Our solution uses optical flow orientations instead of the
complete vectors and exploits the well-known property that under camera
translation, optical flow orientations are independent of object depth. We
introduce a probabilistic model that automatically estimates the number of
observed independent motions and results in a labeling that is consistent with
real-world motion in the scene. The result of our system is that static objects
are correctly identified as one segment, even if they are at different depths.
Color features and information from previous frames in the video sequence are

motivated by the results of the \textit{On-Shell} method on the standard
Maxwell-Higgs model and its Born-Infeld-Higgs model~\cite{Atmaja:2014fha}. Our
method relies on the existence of what we shall call an energy function, $Q$,
which is a mere function of the (effective) fields. The total energy of BPS
vortices, $E_{BPS}$, are simply given by a difference between the boundaries
value of $Q$ at $r\to\infty$ and at $r=0$, $E_{BPS}=Q(r\to\infty)-Q(r=0)$.
Imposing a condition that these (effective) fields are independent, we may
define a BPS Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}_{BPS}$, derived by taking integral of
differential $Q$, $\mathcal{L}_{BPS}=-\int dQ$. Matching the Lagrangian
$\mathcal{L}_{BPS}$ with the corresponding effective Lagrangian, we can extract
several equations. Solving these equations yields the desired BPS equations
and, in some cases, also constraint equations. With our method, the various
known BPS equations of vortices are derived in a relatively simple procedure.

simultaneously, as part of the Monitoring Of GAmma-ray Bright AGN (MOGABA)

15--28~Jy (43~GHz), and 10--21~Jy (86~GHz), showing mild variability of $\leq
50\,\%$ over the period of our observations. The spectral index between 22~GHz
and 86~GHz ranged from $-0.13$ to $-0.36$. Linear polarization angles were
27$^{\circ}$--38$^{\circ}$, 30$^{\circ}$--42$^{\circ}$, and
33$^{\circ}$--50$^{\circ}$ at 22~GHz, 43~GHz, and 86~GHz, respectively. The
degree of linear polarization was in the range of 6--12\,\%, and slightly
decreased with time at all frequencies. We investigated Faraday rotation and
depolarization of the polarized emission at 22--86~GHz, and found Faraday
rotation measures (RM) of $-300$ to $-1200$~rad~m$^{-2}$ between 22~GHz and
43~GHz, and $-800$ to $-5100$~rad~m$^{-2}$ between 43~GHz and 86~GHz. The RM
values follow a power law with a mean power law index $a$ of $2.2$, implying
that the polarized emission at these frequencies travels through a Faraday
screen in or near the jet. We conclude that the regions emitting polarized
radio emission may be different from the region responsible for the 2013
December $\gamma$-ray flare and are maintained by the dominant magnetic field
perpendicular to the direction of the radio jet at milliarcsecond scales.

of the model, in the present work the isospins $I$= 1/2, 3/2 and $J$=0

$I$=3/2 channel there is a better agreement with experiment which extends to
about 1.4 GeV. The effect of final state interactions of $\pi K$ in the $I$=1/2
channel is approximated by the K-matrix method and the poles of the unitarized
scattering amplitude are found. It is shown that the model predicts a light and
broad kappa resonance with a mass and decay width of 670-770 MeV and 640-750
MeV consistent with other prior works. Moreover, the scattering lengths in the

findings that the scalar mesons below and above 1 GeV have substantial

model for the background of a video with a stationary camera, and identifying
pixels that did not conform well to this model. The pixels that were not
well-described by the background model were assumed to be moving objects. Many
systems today maintain models for the foreground as well as the background, and
these models compete to explain the pixels in a video. In this paper, we argue
that the logical endpoint of this evolution is to simply use Bayes' rule to
classify pixels. In particular, it is essential to have a background
likelihood, a foreground likelihood, and a prior at each pixel. A simple
application of Bayes' rule then gives a posterior probability over the label.
The only remaining question is the quality of the component models: the
background likelihood, the foreground likelihood, and the prior. We describe a
model for the likelihoods that is built by using not only the past observations
at a given pixel location, but by also including observations in a spatial
neighborhood around the location. This enables us to model the influence
between neighboring pixels and is an improvement over earlier pixelwise models
that do not allow for such influence. Although similar in spirit to the joint
domain-range model, we show that our model overcomes certain deficiencies in
that model. We use a spatially dependent prior for the background and
foreground. The background and foreground labels from the previous frame, after
spatial smoothing to account for movement of objects,are used to build the
prior for the current frame.

regular kinematics of the large scale HI disk, seen in emission, suggests that
an interaction event occurred too long ago to be responsible for the recent
triggering of the radio activity. In absorption, we detect two absorption lines
along the narrow line of sight of the compact (r<2 pc) radio source. The lines
trace two clouds with opposite radial motions. These may represent a population
of clouds in the very inner regions of the galaxy, which may be involved in
triggering the radio activity. The warm molecular hydrogen (H2 1-0 S(1)
ro-vibrational line) in the innermost kilo-parsec of the galaxy appears to be
distributed in a circum-nuclear disk following the regular kinematics of the HI
and of the stellar component. An exception to this behaviour arises only in the
very centre, where a highly dispersed component is detected. These particular
HI and H2 features suggest that a strong interplay between the radio source and
the surrounding ISM is on-going. The physical properties of the cold gas in the

logics with concatenations and finite-state transducers as atomic operations.
Although restricting to one type of operations yields decidability, little is
known about the decidability of their combined theory, which is especially
relevant when analysing security vulnerabilities of dynamic web pages in a more
realistic browser model. On the one hand, word equations (string logic with
concatenations) cannot precisely capture sanitisation functions (e.g.
htmlescape) and implicit browser transductions (e.g. innerHTML mutations). On
the other hand, transducers suffer from the reverse problem of being able to
model sanitisation functions and browser transductions, but not string
concatenations. Naively combining word equations and transducers easily leads
to an undecidable logic. Our main contribution is to show that the
""straight-line fragment"" of the logic is decidable (complexity ranges from
PSPACE to EXPSPACE). The fragment can express the program logics of
straight-line string-manipulating programs with concatenations and
transductions as atomic operations, which arise when performing bounded model
checking or dynamic symbolic executions. We demonstrate that the logic can
naturally express constraints required for analysing mutation XSS in web
applications. Finally, the logic remains decidable in the presence of length,
letter-counting, regular, indexOf, and disequality constraints.

high data rate communication because of the large bandwidth available at
mm-Wave frequencies. Due to the large path-loss exponent in the mm-Wave range
of the spectrum, directional beamforming with a large antenna gain is necessary
at the transmitter, the receiver or both for capturing sufficient signal power.
This in turn implies that fast and robust channel estimation plays a central
role in systems performance since without a reliable estimate of the channel
state the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) would be much lower than the
minimum necessary for a reliable communication.
  In this paper, we mainly focus on single-antenna users and a multi-antenna
base-station. We propose an adaptive sampling scheme to speed up the user's
signal subspace estimation. In our scheme, the beamforming vector for taking
every new sample is adaptively selected based on all the previous beamforming
vectors and the resulting output observations. We apply the theory of optimal
design of experiments in statistics to design an adaptive algorithm for
estimating the signal subspace of each user. The resulting subspace estimates
for different users can be exploited to efficiently communicate to the users
and to manage the interference. We cast our proposed algorithm as
low-complexity optimization problems, and illustrate its efficiency via
numerical simulations.

interface is pinned to the central ring: one in which it fluctuates
symmetrically around the central ring and another where it fluctuates
asymmetrically. In addition, we find a phase where the interface is centered in
the bulk of the system, either below or above the central ring of the cylinder.
In the latter case, the symmetry breaking is `stronger' than that found in
equilibrium when considering a repulsive potential on the central ring. This
equilibrium model is analyzed here by using a restricted solid-on-solid model.

years and blood pressure is a primary modifiable risk factor. Using data from
the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we examine blood pressure trends in
China from 1991 to 2009, with a concentration on age cohorts and urbanicity.
Very large values of blood pressure are of interest, so we model the
conditional quantile functions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This
allows the covariate effects in the middle of the distribution to vary from
those in the upper tail, the focal point of our analysis. We join the
distributions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure using a copula, which
permits the relationships between the covariates and the two responses to share
information and enables probabilistic statements about systolic and diastolic
blood pressure jointly. Our copula maintains the marginal distributions of the
group quantile effects while accounting for within-subject dependence, enabling
inference at the population and subject levels. Our population-level regression
effects change across quantile level, year and blood pressure type, providing a
rich environment for inference. To our knowledge, this is the first quantile
function model to explicitly model within-subject autocorrelation and is the
first quantile function approach that simultaneously models multivariate
conditional response. We find that the association between high blood pressure
and living in an urban area has evolved from positive to negative, with the
strongest changes occurring in the upper tail. The increase in urbanization
over the last twenty years coupled with the transition from the positive
association between urbanization and blood pressure in earlier years to a more
uniform association with urbanization suggests increasing blood pressure over
time throughout China, even in less urbanized areas. Our methods are available

appear to have a complex star formation history. This suggests repeated star
formation even in the influence of the strong tidal field from supermassive
black holes. <Aim.> In our previous study, we have detected 31 so far unknown
early-type star candidates throughout the Galactic NSC (at 0.5 - 3 pc from Sgr
A*; Nishiyama and Schoedel 2013). The aim of this study is a confirmation of
the spectral type for the candidates. <Method.> We have carried out NIR
spectroscopic observations of the candidates using Subaru/IRCS/AO188/LGS.
K-band spectra for 20 out of the 31 candidates were obtained. By determining an
equivalent width, EW(CO), of the 12CO absorption feature at 2.294 um, we have
derived an effective temperature and a bolometric magnitude for each candidate,
and then constructed an HR diagram. <Results.> No young (~ Myr), massive stars
are included in the 20 candidates we observed; however, 13 candidates are most
likely intermediate-age giants (50 - 500 Myr). Two other sources have ages of
~1 Gyr, and the remaining five sources are old (> 1 Gyr), late-type giants.
<Conclusions.> Although none of the early-type star candidates from our
previous narrow-band imaging observations can be confirmed as a young star, we
find that the photometric technique is sensitive to distinguish old, late-type
giants from young and intermediate-age populations. The intermediate-age stars
could be so far unknown members of a population formed in a starburst ~100 Myr
ago. Finding no young (~ a few Myr) stars at R = 0.5 - 3 pc favors the in-situ
formation scenario for the presence of the young stars at R < 0.5 pc.
Furthermore, the different spatial distributions of the young and the
intermediate-age stars imply that the Galactic NSC is an aggregate of stars
born in different places and under different physical conditions.

disordered systems which allows to associate to the studied problems a cost
function referred as the potential of free entropy in physics. It allows to
predict the different phases of typical complexity of the problem as a function
of external parameters such as the noise level or the number of measurements
one has about the signal: the inference can be typically easy, hard or
impossible. We will see that the hard phase corresponds to a regime of
coexistence of the actual solution together with another unwanted solution of
the message passing equations. In this phase, it represents a metastable state
which is not the true equilibrium solution. This phenomenon can be linked to
supercooled water blocked in the liquid state below its freezing critical
temperature. We will use a method that allows to overcome the metastability
mimicing the strategy adopted by nature itself for supercooled water: the
nucleation and spatial coupling. In supercooled water, a weak localized
perturbation is enough to create a crystal nucleus that will propagate in all
the medium thanks to the physical couplings between closeby atoms. The same
process will help the algorithm to find the signal, thanks to the introduction
of a nucleus containing local information about the signal. It will then spread
as a ""reconstruction wave"" similar to the crystal in the water. After an
introduction to statistical inference and sparse linear estimation, we will
introduce the necessary tools. Then we will move to applications of these
notions to signal processing and coding theory problems.

involves several uncertainties that are related to both the underlying
Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA) model and the
production-specific sample data on the prevalence and concentrations of
microbes in production batches. We used Bayesian modeling for statistical
inference and evidence synthesis of two sample data sets. Thus, parameter
uncertainty was represented by a joint posterior distribution, which we then
used to predict the risk and to evaluate the criteria for acceptance of
production batches. We also applied the Bayesian model to compare alternative
criteria, accounting for the statistical uncertainty of parameters, conditional
on the data sets. Comparison of the posterior mean relative risk,
$E(\mathit{RR}|\mathrm{data})=E(P(\mathrm{illness}|\mathrm{criterion is

$\mathit{RPR}=P(\mathrm{illness}|\mathrm{data, criterion is

computing is more efficient for RPR. Based on the sample data, together with

invariant, the contraction algebra, which may be associated to such curves. It
characterises their geometric and homological properties in a unified manner,
using the theory of noncommutative deformations. Toda has now clarified the
enumerative significance of the contraction algebra for flopping curves,
calculating its dimension in terms of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. Before
reviewing these results, and others, I give a brief introduction to the rich
geometry of flopping curves on 3-folds, starting from the resolutions of
Kleinian surface singularities. This is based on a talk given at VBAC 2014 in
Berlin.

Although first-principles calculations based on the real-space

computers, large-scale transport calculations are hampered by the computational
cost and numerical instability of the computation of the self-energy terms.
Using the orthogonal complement vectors of the space spanned by the generalized
Bloch waves that actually contribute to transport phenomena, the computational
accuracy of transport properties is significantly improved with a moderate
computational cost. To demonstrate the efficiency of the present technique, the
electron-transport properties of a Stone-Wales (SW) defect in graphene and
silicene are examined. The resonance scattering of the SW defect is observed in
the conductance spectrum of silicene since the $\sigma^\ast$ state of silicene
lies near the Fermi energy. In addition, we found that one conduction channel
is sensitive to a defect near the Fermi energy, while the other channel is
hardly affected. This characteristic behavior of the conduction channels is
interpreted in terms of the bonding network between the bilattices of the
honeycomb structure in the formation of the SW defect. The present technique
enables us to distinguish the different behaviors of the two conduction
channels in graphene and silicene owing to its excellent accuracy.

can be used to study and predict the evolution of their properties in the

to model these materials, which is based on a random covalent network (RCN)
model, extended here to a full compositional derivation (the eRCN model), and a
defective graphite (DG) model for the hydrogen poorer materials where the eRCN
model is no longer valid. Results. We provide simple expressions that enable

Structural annealing, resulting from hydrogen atom loss, results in a

Conclusions. The model predicts changes in the optical properties of

family, Pearson's and Spearman's estimators. Two discrete bivariate
distributions were examined: the Poisson and the Negative Binomial. The
comparison between these two estimators took place using classical and
bootstrap techniques for the construction of confidence intervals. Thus, these
techniques are also subject to comparison. Simulation studies were also used
for the relative efficiency and bias of the two estimators. Pearson's estimator
performed slightly better than Spearman's.

to nonlocally ""steer"" the other observer's state through local measurements. It
exhibits a unique asymmetric property, i.e., the steerability of one observer
to steer the other's state could be different from each other, which can even
lead to a one-way EPR steering, i.e., only one observer obtains the
steerability in the two-observer case. This property is inherently different
from the symmetric concepts of entanglement and Bell nonlocality and has been
attracted increasing interests. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the
asymmetric EPR steering for a class of two-qubit states in the case of two
measurement settings. We propose a practical method to quantify the
steerability. We then provide a necessary and sufficient condition for EPR
steering and clearly show the case of one-way EPR steering. Our work provides a
new insight on the fundamental asymmetry of quantum nonlocality and would find
potential application in asymmetric quantum information processing.

potential (LFP) has again become a popular measure of neuronal activity in both
basic research and clinical applications. Proper understanding of the LFP
requires detailed mathematical modeling incorporating the anatomical and
electrophysiological features of neurons near the recording electrode, as well
as synaptic inputs from the entire network. Here we propose a hybrid modeling
scheme combining the efficiency of commonly used simplified point-neuron
network models with the biophysical principles underlying LFP generation by
real neurons. The scheme can be used with an arbitrary number of point-neuron
network populations. The LFP predictions rely on populations of
network-equivalent, anatomically reconstructed multicompartment neuron models
with layer-specific synaptic connectivity. The present scheme allows for a full
separation of the network dynamics simulation and LFP generation. For
illustration, we apply the scheme to a full-scale cortical network model for a
$\sim$1 mm$^2$ patch of primary visual cortex and predict laminar LFPs for
different network states, assess the relative LFP contribution from different
laminar populations, and investigate the role of synaptic input correlations
and neuron density on the LFP. The generic nature of the hybrid scheme and its
publicly available implementation in \texttt{hybridLFPy} form the basis for LFP
predictions from other point-neuron network models, as well as extensions of
the current application to larger circuitry and additional biological detail.

to statistical anisotropy. The simplest possible way to construct anisotropic
inflation is to introduce vector fields. During the course of this thesis, we
study models of anisotropic inflation and their observational implications such

the gauge field which breaks the conformal invariance while preserving the
gauge invariance. We show that in these kind of models, there can be an
attractor phase in the evolution of the system when the back-reaction of the
gauge field becomes important in the evolution of the inflaton field. We then
study the cosmological perturbation theory in these kind of models. More
specifically, we calculate the anisotropic corrections due to the presence of
the vector field. We then generalize the separate universe formalism to our
anisotropic set up and use it in some specific examples of anisotropic
inflation. Finally, we connect the primordial anisotropies to the specific
examples and to CMB observations. We calculate the TT, TE, TB, EB and BB

microwaves has proven to be an effective, non-invasive and inexpensive method.
So far the experimental schemes have used continuous waves. This has either
been in the form of travelling waves that are propagated, or standing waves
that are trapped, in both cases within a segment of the accelerator chamber.
The variation in the wave dispersion relation caused by the periodic creation
and decay of the electron cloud leads to a phase modulation in the former case,
and a frequency modulation in the latter. In general, these methods enable the
measurement of a time averaged electron cloud density. In this paper we propose
a time resolved measurement by using pulses propagated over a finite length of
the accelerator chamber. The pulses are launched periodically, once after a
bunch train has passed and then again half a revolution period later. This
results in pulses alternating between a dispersion that is either affected by a
cloud or not. The resulting spectrum of the signal can be related to the
electron density sampled by the pulse that propagates through the cloud. By
varying the delay of the launch of the pulse with respect to the train passage,
one can map the cloud density at different points behind the train.

data as well as unresolved optical photometry obtained in the dim state to
study the gas and dust content of the absorber causing the dimming. The X-ray
data show that the absorbing column density increased from
$N_H<0.1\times10^{22}\,$cm$^{-2}$ during the bright state to
$\approx2\times10^{22}\,$cm$^{-2}$ in the dim state. The brightness ratio
between dim and bright state at optical to NIR wavelengths shows only a
moderate wavelength dependence and the NIR color-color diagram suggests no
substantial reddening. Taken together, this indicates gray absorption by large
grains ($\gtrsim1\,\mu$m) with a dust mass column density of
$\gtrsim2\times10^{-4}\,$g$\,$cm$^{-2}$. Comparison with $N_H$ shows that an
absorber responsible for the optical/NIR dimming and the X-ray absorption is
compatible with the ISM's gas-to-dust ratio, i.e., that grains grow in the disk
surface layers without largely altering the gas-to-dust ratio. Lastly, we
discuss a scenario in which a common mechanism can explain the long-lasting

  Generalizations","38 pages",,,,"cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Low rank matrix approximation is an important tool in machine learning. Given
a data matrix, low rank approximation helps to find factors, patterns and
provides concise representations for the data. Research on low rank
approximation usually focus on real matrices. However, in many applications
data are binary (categorical) rather than continuous. This leads to the problem
of low rank approximation of binary matrix. Here we are given a $d \times n$
binary matrix $A$ and a small integer $k$. The goal is to find two binary
matrices $U$ and $V$ of sizes $d \times k$ and $k \times n$ respectively, so
that the Frobenius norm of $A - U V$ is minimized. There are two models of this
problem, depending on the definition of the dot product of binary vectors: The
$\mathrm{GF}(2)$ model and the Boolean semiring model. Unlike low rank
approximation of real matrix which can be efficiently solved by Singular Value
Decomposition, approximation of binary matrix is $NP$-hard even for $k=1$.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of Column Subset Selection (CSS), in
which one low rank matrix must be formed by $k$ columns of the data matrix. We
characterize the approximation ratio of CSS for binary matrices. For $GF(2)$
model, we show the approximation ratio of CSS is bounded by
$\frac{k}{2}+1+\frac{k}{2(2^k-1)}$ and this bound is asymptotically tight. For
Boolean model, it turns out that CSS is no longer sufficient to obtain a bound.
We then develop a Generalized CSS (GCSS) procedure in which the columns of one
low rank matrix are generated from Boolean formulas operating bitwise on
columns of the data matrix. We show the approximation ratio of GCSS is bounded
by $2^{k-1}+1$, and the exponential dependency on $k$ is inherent.

such systems. In the case of equal mass fermions or bosons with two or more
internal degrees of freedom, one can map the problem onto the well-known
Heisenberg spin models. However, many interesting physical systems contain
mixtures of particles with different masses. Therefore, a generalization of the
recent strong-coupling techniques would be highly desirable. This is
particularly important since such problems are generally considered
non-integrable and thus the hugely successful Bethe ansatz approach cannot be
applied. Here we discuss some initial steps towards this goal by investigating
small ensembles of one-dimensional harmonically trapped particles where
pairwise interactions are either vanishing or infinitely strong with focus on
the mass-imbalanced case. We discuss a (semi)-analytical approach to describe
systems using hyperspherical coordinates where the interaction is effectively
decoupled from the trapping potential. As an illustrative example we analyze
mass-imbalanced four-particle two-species mixtures with strong interactions
between the two species. For such systems we calculate the energies, densities

bottlenecks in mRNA translation when ribosomes stall due to lack of resources,
i.e. tRNAs charged with the missing amino acid. Recent experiments also show
less obvious effects such as increased charging of other (non-starved) tRNA
species and selective charging of isoaccepting tRNAs. We present a mechanism
which accounts for these observations, and shows that production of some
proteins can actually increase under starvation. One might assume that such
responses could only be a result of sophisticated control pathways, but here we
show that these effects can occur naturally due to changes in the supply and
demand for different resources, and that control can be accomplished through
selective use of rare codons. We develop a model for translation which includes
the dynamics of the charging and use of aa-tRNAs, explicitly taking into
account the effect of specific codon sequences. This constitutes a new control
mechanism in gene regulation which emerges at the community level, i.e., via

Here we take an information-theoretic approach to bounded rationality, where
information-processing costs are measured by the relative entropy between a
posterior decision strategy and a given fixed prior strategy. In the case of
multiple environments, it can be shown that there is an optimal prior rendering
the bounded rationality problem equivalent to the rate distortion problem for
lossy compression in information theory. Accordingly, the optimal prior and
posterior strategies can be computed by the well-known Blahut-Arimoto algorithm
which requires the computation of partition sums over all possible outcomes and
cannot be applied straightforwardly to continuous problems. Here we derive a
sampling-based alternative update rule for the adaptation of prior behaviors of
decision-makers and we show convergence to the optimal prior predicted by rate
distortion theory. Importantly, the update rule avoids typical infeasible
operations such as the computation of partition sums. We show in simulations a
proof of concept for discrete action and environment domains. This approach is
not only interesting as a generic computational method, but might also provide

functions. We introduce a new algorithm called the selective linearization
method, which iteratively linearizes all but one of the functions and employs
simple proximal steps. The algorithm is a form of multiple operator splitting
in which the order of processing partial functions is not fixed, but rather
determined in the course of calculations. Global convergence is proved and
estimates of the convergence rate are derived. Specifically, the number of
iterations needed to achieve solution accuracy $\varepsilon$ is of order
$\mathcal{O}\big(\ln(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon\big)$. We also illustrate the
operation of the algorithm on structured regularization problems.

II supernova with several hitherto-unseen properties. Although it initially
showed strong symmetric spectral emission features attributable to
\ion{He}{ii}, \ion{N}{iii}, and \ion{C}{iii}, reminiscent of some interacting
SNe, it transitioned into an object that would fall more naturally under a type
II-Plateau (IIP) classification. However, its spectral evolution revealed
several unusual properties: metal lines appeared later than expected, were
weak, and some species were conspicuous by their absence. Furthermore, the line
velocities were found to be lower than expected given the plateau brightness,
breaking the SNe~IIP standardised candle method for distance estimates. We
found that, in combination with a short phase of early-time
ejecta-circumstellar material interaction, metal-poor ejecta, and a large
progenitor radius could reasonably account for the observed behaviour.
Comparisons with synthetic model spectra of SNe~IIP of a given progenitor mass
would imply a progenitor star metallicity as low as 0.1\,Z$_{\odot}$. LSQ13fn
highlights the diversity of SNe~II and the many competing physical effects that
come into play towards the final stages of massive star evolution immediately
preceding core-collapse.

emerges when the Fermi level is inside the magnetically induced gap around the

reported to be about 50 meV, the observable temperature of QAHE has been
limited below 300 mK. We attempt magnetic-Cr modulation doping into topological
insulator (Bi,Sb)2Te3 films to increase the observable temperature of QAHE. By
introducing the rich-Cr-doped thin (1 nm) layers at the vicinity of the both
surfaces based on non-Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 films, we have succeeded in
observing the QAHE up to 2 K. The improvement in the observable temperature
achieved by this modulation-doping appears to be originating from the
suppression of the disorder in the surface state interacting with the rich
magnetic moments. Such a superlattice designing of the stabilized QAHE may pave
a way to dissipation-less electronics based on the highertemperature and zero

intermixing occurs at the Co-on-Zr interfaces. The explanation of this opposite

the mixing enthalpies of the Co-Mg, Co-Zr and Mg-Zr systems, which shows that
the Co-Zr system presents anegative value and the two others positive values.
Together with the difference of the surface free energies of Zr and Co, this

Accepted by A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201527297",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transiting planets around stars are discovered mostly through photometric
surveys. Unlike radial velocity surveys, photometric surveys do not tend to
target slow rotators, inactive or metal-rich stars. Nevertheless, we suspect
that observational biases could also impact transiting-planet hosts. This paper
aims to evaluate how selection effects reflect on the evolutionary stage of
both a limited sample of transiting-planet host stars (TPH) and a wider sample
of planet-hosting stars detected through radial velocity analysis. Then, thanks
to uniform derivation of stellar ages, a homogeneous comparison between
exoplanet hosts and field star age distributions is developed. Stellar
parameters have been computed through our custom-developed isochrone placement
algorithm, according to PARSEC models. The notable aspects of our algorithm
include the treatment of element diffusion, activity checks in terms of
$\log{R'_{HK}}$ and $v\sin{i}$, and the evaluation of the stellar evolutionary
speed in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram in order to better constrain age.
Working with TPH, the observational stellar mean density $\rho_{\star}$ allows
us to compute stellar luminosity even if the distance is not available, by
combining $\rho_{\star}$ with the spectroscopic $\log{g}$. The median value of
the TPH ages is $\sim5$ Gyr. Even if this sample is not very large, however,
the result is very similar to what we found for the sample of spectroscopic
hosts, whose modal and median values are [3, 3.5) Gyr and $\sim4.8$ Gyr,
respectively. Thus, these stellar samples suffer almost the same selection
effects. We also conclude that the age of our Sun is consistent with the age
distribution of solar neighbourhood MS stars with spectral types from late F to
early K, regardless of whether they harbour planets or not. We considered the
possibility that our selected samples are older than the average disc
population.

nonlinear and causes width bifurcation and, respectively, level repulsion. It
is strong only in the neighborhood of singular (exceptional) points. We provide
typical results for the phase rigidity and the mixing of the biorthogonal
eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. A completely unexpected result is that the
phase rigidity approaches a value near to one (characteristic of orthogonal
eigenfunctions) when width bifurcation (or level repulsion) becomes maximum.
This behavior of the phase rigidity is caused exclusively by the nonlinearity
of the source term of the Schr\""odinger equation. The eigenfunctions remain
mixed in the set of original wavefunctions also under these critical
conditions. Eventually, a dynamical phase transition occurs. This process is
irreversible. It allows, among others, a physical interpretation of the
well-known resonance trapping phenomenon. Our results for the eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are supported by experimental
results obtained in different systems. The relation of our results for open
quantum systems under critical conditions to those in optics and photonics with

Some experimental efforts to test EPR steering in terms of inequalities have
been made, which usually require many measurement settings. Analogy to the
""All-Versus-Nothing"" (AVN) proof of Bell's theorem without inequalities,
testing steerability without inequalities would be more strong and require less
resource. Moreover, the practical meaning of steering implies that it should
also be possible to store the state information on the side to be steered, a
result that has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Using a recent AVN
criterion for two qubit entangled states, we experimentally implement a
practical steering game using quantum memory. Further more, we develop a
theoretical method to deal with the noise and finite measurement statistics
within the AVN framework and apply it to analyze the experimental data. Our
results clearly show the facilitation of the AVN criterion for testing
steerability and provide a particularly strong perspective for understanding
EPR steering.

$\mathbb{R}^d$-valued diffusion process. This method is based on a Markovian
and componentwise product quantization and allows us, from a numerical point of
view, to speak of {\em fast online quantization} in dimension greater than one
since the product quantization of the Euler scheme of the diffusion process and
its companion weights and transition probabilities may be computed quite
instantaneously. We show that the resulting quantization process is a Markov
chain, then, we compute the associated companion weights and transition
probabilities from (semi-) closed formulas. From the analytical point of view,
we show that the induced quantization errors at the $k$-th discretization step
$t_k$ is a cumulative of the marginal quantization error up to time $t_k$.
Numerical experiments are performed for the pricing of a Basket call option,
for the pricing of a European call option in a Heston model and for the
approximation of the solution of backward stochastic differential equations to
show the performances of the method.

literature, it is possible to obtain updated phase - polarization curves for
several tens of objects. In a separate paper (Cellino et al., 2015a, MNRAS,
451, 3473) we have produced new calibrations of different relations between the
geometric albedo and several polarimetric parameters, based on an analysis of a
limited sample of asteroids for which the albedo is known with sufficient
accuracy. In this paper, we present the main polarization parameters and
corresponding albedos for a larger dataset of asteroids which we did not use
for calibration purposes. We find a good agreement between the albedo values
computed using different polarization parameters. Conversely, in the case of
the so-called Barbarian asteroids the situation is rather unclear. Moreover, we
present an updated analysis of the distributions of different polarimetric
parameters, including the so-called inversion angle and the solar phase angle
corresponding to the extreme value of negative polarization, and study their
mutual relations. We find that the above parameters can be used to clearly
distinguish some unusual classes of asteroids. Polarimetric parameters are
known to be related to physical properties of asteroid surfaces which are
difficult to infer by means of other observing techniques. By using a much
larger dataset, in our analysis we confirm and extend some results obtained in
the past by other authors, and we explore more systematically some features
that had been mostly unexplored before, mainly concerning the morphology of the
negative polarization branch.

key-points for the volcanic hazards evaluation. To this aim, in the last
decade, geophysical radiography techniques using cosmic muon particles have
been proposed. By measuring the differential attenuation of the muon flux as a
function of the amount of rock crossed along different directions, it is
possible to determine the density distribution of the interior of a volcano. Up
to now, a number of experiments have been based on the detection of the muon
tracks crossing hodoscopes, made up of scintillators or nuclear emulsion
planes. Using telescopes based on the atmospheric Cherenkov imaging technique,
we propose a new approach to study the interior of volcanoes detecting the
Cherenkov light produced by relativistic cosmic-ray muons that survive after
crossing the volcano. The Cherenkov light produced along the muon path is
imaged as a typical annular pattern containing all the essential information to
reconstruct particle direction and energy. Our new approach offers the
advantage of a negligible background and an improved spatial resolution. To
test the feasibility of our new method, we have carried out simulations with a
toy-model based on the geometrical parameters of ASTRI SST-2M, i.e. the imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescope currently under installation onto the Etna
volcano. Comparing the results of our simulations with previous experiments
based on particle detectors, we gain at least a factor of 10 in sensitivity.
The result of this study shows that we resolve an empty cylinder with a radius
of about 100 m located inside a volcano in less than 4 days, which implies a
limit on the magma velocity of 5 m/h.

Probability decision rule. However, estimating the complete joint distribution

have a misclassification rate no larger than twice the misclassification rate

the proposed algorithm is equivalent to a randomized linear regression

similar to the recent Discrete Chebyshev Classifier (DCC) approach [2], while
the proposed algorithm has significant computational advantages since it only

for wind turbines from high frequency data of wind speed measurements u(t) and

drift field, give a comprehensive description of the conversion dynamic over
the whole operating range of the wind turbine. The method deals with high
frequent data instead of 10 min means. It is therefore possible to gain a
reliable power curve already from a small amount of data per wind speed.
Furthermore, the method is able to visualize multiple fixed points, which is
e.g. characteristic for the transition from partial to full load or in case the
conversion process deviates from the standard procedures. In order to gain a
deeper knowledge it is essential that the method works not only for measured
data but also for numerical wind turbine models and synthetic wind fields.
Here, we characterize the dynamics of a detailed numerical wind turbine model
and calculate the Langevin power curve for different data samplings. We show,
how to get reliable results from synthetic data and verify the applicability of
the method for field measurements with ultra-sonic, cup and Lidar measurements.
The independence of the fixed points on site specific turbulence effects is
also confirmed with the numerical model. Furthermore, we demonstrate the

literature and fitted the resulting broadband spectra with single or broken
power-law functions. For 48 census pulsars such fits are being published for
the first time. Typically, the choice between single and broken power-laws, as
well as the location of the spectral break, were highly influenced by the
spectral coverage of the available flux density measurements. In particular,
the inclusion of measurements below 100 MHz appears essential for investigating
the low-frequency turnover in the spectra for most of the census pulsars. For
several pulsars, we compared the spectral indices from different works and
found the typical spread of values to be within 0.5--1.5, suggesting a
prevailing underestimation of spectral index errors in the literature. The
census observations yielded some unexpected individual source results, as we

levels of cores, CPUs, and processing nodes. Query optimization must exploit
high degrees of parallelism in order not to gradually become the bottleneck of
query evaluation. We show how to parallelize query optimization at a massive
scale.
  We present algorithms for parallel query optimization in left-deep and bushy
plan spaces. At optimization start, we divide the plan space for a given query
into partitions of equal size that are explored in parallel by worker nodes. At
the end of optimization, each worker returns the optimal plan in its partition
to the master which determines the globally optimal plan from the
partition-optimal plans. No synchronization or data exchange is required during
the actual optimization phase. The amount of data sent over the network, at the
start and at the end of optimization, as well as the complexity of serial steps
within our algorithms increase only linearly in the number of workers and in
the query size. The time and space complexity of optimization within one
partition decreases uniformly in the number of workers. We parallelize single-
and multi-objective query optimization over a cluster with 100 nodes in our
experiments, using more than 250 concurrent worker threads (Spark executors).
Despite high network latency and task assignment overheads, parallelization
yields speedups of up to one order of magnitude for large queries whose

provides threads with exclusive access to shared data. \emph{Coarse-grained}
locking typically forces threads to access large amounts of data sequentially
and, thus, does not fully exploit hardware concurrency. Program-specific
\emph{fine-grained} locking or \emph{non-blocking} (\emph{i.e.}, not using
locks) synchronization, on the other hand, is a dark art to most programmers
and trusted to the wisdom of a few computing experts. Thus, it is appealing to
seek a middle ground between these two extremes: a synchronization mechanism
that relieves the programmer of the overhead of reasoning about data conflicts
that may arise from concurrent operations without severely limiting the
program's performance. The \emph{Transactional Memory (TM)} abstraction is
proposed as such a mechanism: it intends to combine an easy-to-use programming
interface with an efficient utilization of the concurrent-computing abilities
provided by multicore architectures. TM allows the programmer to
\emph{speculatively} execute sequences of shared-memory operations as
\emph{atomic transactions} with \emph{all-or-nothing} semantics: the
transaction can either \emph{commit}, in which case it appears as executed
sequentially, or \emph{abort}, in which case its update operations do not take
effect. Thus, the programmer can design software having only sequential
semantics in mind and let TM take care, at run-time, of resolving the conflicts
in concurrent executions.
  Intuitively, we want TMs to allow for as much \emph{concurrency} as possible:
in the absence of severe data conflicts, transactions should be able to
progress in parallel. But what are the inherent costs associated with providing
high degrees of concurrency in TMs? This is the central question of the thesis.

not a reasonable optimization goal in those cases as it might require an
infinite number of samples. We therefore introduce probably approximately
optimal query optimization (PAO) where the goal is to find a query plan whose
cost is near-optimal with a certain probability. We will justify why PAO is a
suitable formalism to model scenarios in which predicate sampling and
optimization need to be interleaved.
  We present the first algorithm for PAO. Our algorithm is non-intrusive and
uses standard query optimizers and sampling components as sub-functions. It is
generic and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios. Our algorithm is
iterative and calculates in each iteration a query plan together with a region
in the selectivity space where the plan has near-optimal cost. It determines
the confidence that the true selectivity values fall within the aforementioned
region and chooses the next samples to take based on the current state if the
confidence does not reach the threshold specified as problem input. We devise
different algorithm variants and analyze their complexity. We experimentally
compare them in terms of the number of optimizer invocations, samples, and
iterations over many different query classes.

Here, we present an attempt to alleviate these difficulties by solving for the

particle-in-cell simulations. We find that the low-energy radiation is
synchro-curvature radiation from the polar-cap regions within the light
cylinder. In contrast, the high-energy emission is synchrotron radiation that
originates exclusively from the Y-point and the equatorial current sheet where
relativistic magnetic reconnection accelerates particles. In most cases,
synthetic high-energy lightcurves contain two peaks that form when the current
sheet sweeps across the observer's line of sight. We find clear evidence of
caustics in the emission pattern from the current sheet. High-obliquity
solutions can present up to two additional secondary peaks from energetic
particles in the wind region accelerated by the reconnection-induced flow near
the current sheet. The high-energy radiative efficiency depends sensitively on
the viewing angle, and decreases with increasing pulsar inclination. The
high-energy emission is concentrated in the equatorial regions where most of
the pulsar spindown is released and dissipated. These results have important
implications for the interpretation of gamma-ray pulsar data.

formation of Local Group galaxies with calculations of the galactic habitable
zone (GHZ), a region of space which has sufficient metallicity to form
terrestrial planets without being subject to hazardous radiation. These
simulations allow us to make substantial progress in mapping out the asymmetric
three-dimensional GHZ and its time evolution for the Milky Way (MW) and
Triangulum (M33) galaxies, as opposed to works that generally assume an
azimuthally symmetric GHZ.
  Applying typical habitability metrics to MW and M33, we find that while a
large number of habitable planets exist as close as a few kiloparsecs from the
galactic centre, the probability of individual planetary systems being
habitable rises as one approaches the edge of the stellar disc. Tidal streams
and satellite galaxies also appear to be fertile grounds for habitable planet
formation.
  In short, we find that both galaxies arrive at similar GHZs by different
evolutionary paths, as measured by the first and third quartiles of surviving
biospheres. For the Milky Way, this interquartile range begins as a narrow band
at large radii, expanding to encompass much of the galaxy at intermediate times
before settling at a range of 2-13kpc. In the case of M33, the opposite
behaviour occurs - the initial and final interquartile ranges are quite
similar, showing gradual evolution. This suggests that galaxy assembly history
strongly influences the time evolution of the GHZ, which will affect the
relative time lag between biospheres in different galactic locations. We end by
noting the caveats involved in such studies and demonstrate that high
resolution cosmological simulations will play a vital role in understanding
habitability on galactic scales, provided that these simulations accurately
resolve chemical evolution.

training phase is used to prevent the eavesdropper from obtaining accurate
channel state information (CSI) whereas AN in the data transmission phase can
be used to mask the transmission of the confidential message. By considering
AN-assisted training and secrecy beamforming schemes, we first derive bounds on
the achievable secrecy rate and obtain a closed-form approximation that is
asymptotically tight at high SNR. Then, by maximizing the approximate
achievable secrecy rate, the optimal power allocation between signal and AN in
both training and data transmission phases is obtained for both conventional
and AN-assisted training based schemes. We show that the use of AN is necessary
to achieve a high secrecy rate at high SNR, and its use in the training phase
can be more efficient than that in the data transmission phase when the
coherence time is large. However, at low SNR, the use of AN provides no
advantage since CSI is difficult to obtain in this case. Numerical results are
presented to verify our theoretical claims.

networks have been becoming popular in recent years. However, video streaming
services significantly impact the performance of wireless cellular networks
because they are bandwidth hogs. To maintain the system performance, effective
admission control and resource allocation mechanisms based on an accurate
mathematical analysis are required. On the other hand, the quality of a
wireless link usually changes with time due to the user mobility or
time-varying channel characteristics. To counteract such time-varying channels
and improve the spectral efficiency, adaptive modulation and coding (AMC)
scheme can be adopted in offering unicast IPTV services for mobile users. In
this paper, closed-form solutions for the bandwidth usage, blocking rate, and
dropping rate of unicast IPTV services over wireless cellular networks were
derived based on the novel queueing model that considers both user mobility and
AMC. Simulations were also conducted to validate the accuracy of analytical
results. Numerical results demonstrate that the presented analytical results
are accurate. Based on the accurate closed-form solutions, network providers

restrict the amount of content shared among the users, we analyze the optimal

cannot provide the late-time cosmic expansion of the universe due to its
vanishing at late time. In this work, we propose a new class of mass-varying
massive gravity in which the graviton mass varies according to a kinetic term
of a k-essence field. By using a more general form of the fiducial metric, we
found a solution such that a non-vanishing graviton mass can drive the
accelerated expansion of the universe at late time. We also perform dynamical
analyses of such model and found that without introducing the k-essence
Lagrangian, the graviton mass can be responsible for both dark contents of the
universe, namely dark energy that drives the accelerated expansion of the
universe and non-relativistic matter that plays the role of dark matter.
Moreover, by including the k-essence Lagrangian, we found that it is possible
to alleviate the so-called cosmic coincidence problem.

universe - is a prescription for calculating null geodesics, and timelike
geodesics as a function of their proper time. In this paper, we consider the
most general linear connection compatible with homogeneity and isotropy, but
not necessarily with a metric. A light-cone structure is assigned by choosing a
set of geodesics representing light rays. This defines a ""scale factor"" and a
local notion of distance, as that travelled by light in a given proper time
interval. We find that the velocities and relativistic energies of free-falling
bodies decrease in time as a consequence of cosmic expansion, but at a rate
that can be different than that dictated by the usual metric framework. By
extrapolating this behavior to photons redshift, we find that the latter is in
principle independent of the ""scale factor"". Interestingly, redshift-distance
relations and other standard geometric observables are modified in this
extended framework, in a way that could be experimentally tested. An extremely
tight constraint on the model, however, is represented by the blackbody-ness of
the Cosmic Microwave Background. Finally, as a check, we also consider the
effects of a non-metric connection in a different set-up, namely, that of a
static, spherically symmetric spacetime.

  Estimation in Subsurface Hydrology",,,,,"physics.data-an physics.geo-ph stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF) is an efficient approach to addressing
uncertainties in subsurface groundwater models. The EnKF sequentially
integrates field data into simulation models to obtain a better
characterization of the model's state and parameters. These are generally
estimated following joint and dual filtering strategies, in which, at each
assimilation cycle, a forecast step by the model is followed by an update step
with incoming observations. The Joint-EnKF directly updates the augmented
state-parameter vector while the Dual-EnKF employs two separate filters, first
estimating the parameters and then estimating the state based on the updated
parameters. In this paper, we reverse the order of the forecast-update steps
following the one-step-ahead (OSA) smoothing formulation of the Bayesian
filtering problem, based on which we propose a new dual EnKF scheme, the
Dual-EnKF$_{\rm OSA}$. Compared to the Dual-EnKF, this introduces a new update
step to the state in a fully consistent Bayesian framework, which is shown to
enhance the performance of the dual filtering approach without any significant
increase in the computational cost. Numerical experiments are conducted with a
two-dimensional synthetic groundwater aquifer model to assess the performance
and robustness of the proposed Dual-EnKF$_{\rm OSA}$, and to evaluate its
results against those of the Joint- and Dual-EnKFs. The proposed scheme is able
to successfully recover both the hydraulic head and the aquifer conductivity,
further providing reliable estimates of their uncertainties. Compared with the
standard Joint- and Dual-EnKFs, the proposed scheme is found more robust to
different assimilation settings, such as the spatial and temporal distribution
of the observations, and the level of noise in the data. Based on our
experimental setups, it yields up to 25% more accurate state and parameters
estimates.

interstellar medium (wim) in early-type galaxies (ETGs) hold key observational
constraints to nuclear activity and the buildup history of these massive,
quiescent systems. High-quality integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data with a
wide spectral and spatial coverage, such as those from the CALIFA survey, offer
an unprecedented opportunity for advancing our understanding of the wim in
ETGs. This article centers on a 2D investigation of the wim component in 32
nearby (<~150Mpc) ETGs from CALIFA, complementing a previous 1D analysis of the
same sample (Papaderos et al. 2013; P13). We include here H\alpha\ intensity
and equivalent width (EW) maps and radial profiles, diagnostic emission-line
ratios, besides ionized-gas and stellar kinematics. This study is supplemented
by \tau-ratio maps as an efficient means to quantify the role of
photoionization by pAGB stars, as compared to other mechanisms (e.g., AGN,
low-level star formation). Additionally, we extend the tentative classification
proposed in P13 by the type i+, which is assigned to a subset of type i ETGs
exhibiting ongoing low-level star-formation (SF) in their periphery. This
finding along with faint traces of localized SF in the extranuclear component
of several of our sample ETGs points to a non-negligible contribution by OB
stars to the total ionizing budget. We also demonstrate that, at the typical
emission-line detection threshold of ~2\AA in previous studies, most of the
extranuclear wim emission in an ETG may evade detection, which could in turn
prompt its classification as an entirely gas-devoid system. This study adds
further observational evidence for a considerable heterogeneity among ETGs with
regard to the physical properties and 2D kinematics of the wim component, and
underscores the importance of IFS studies over their entire optical extent.

numerical solutions of the full Fourier equations in a steady state frame. The
flow and heat transfer are coupled through Marangoni and temperature dependent

before, here a fully coupled model is proposed. Another novelty consists in the
asymptotic approach in contrast to the weighted residual approach which have
been formerly applied to these problems.
