asteroid 4179 Toutatis at a closest distance of 770 meters from the asteroid's
surface. The observations show that Toutatis has an irregular surface and its
shape resembles a ginger-root of a smaller lobe (head) and a larger lobe
(body). Such bilobate shape is indicative of a contact binary origin for
Toutatis. In addition, the high-resolution images better than 3 meters provide
a number of new discoveries about this asteroid, such as an 800-meter
depression at the end of the large lobe, a sharply perpendicular silhouette
near the neck region, boulders, indicating that Toutatis is probably a
rubble-pile asteroid. Chang'e-2 observations have significantly revealed new
insights into the geological features and the formation and evolution of this
asteroid. In final, we brief the future Chinese asteroid mission concept.

intense laser field is studied numerically and analytically. We find that the
cut-off regime is characterized by equal dephasing between the successive
harmonics. The change of the harmonic phase-locking when HHG evolves from the
cut-off to the plateau regime determines the optimal bandwidth of the spectral
region which should be used for attosecond pulse generation via amplitude
gating technique. The cut-off regime is also characterized by a linear
dependence of the harmonic phase on the fundamental intensity. The
proportionality coefficient grows as the cube of the fundamental wavelength,
thus this dependence becomes very important for the HHG by mid-infrared fields.
Moreover, for every high harmonic there is a {\it range} of laser intensities
providing the generation in the cut-off regime and the atomic response
magnitude in this regime can be greater than that in the plateau regime. Thus
the cut-off regime substantially contributes to the harmonic energy emitted
under typical experimental conditions where the laser intensity varies in time
and space.

large finite element computations on extreme scale computing systems. Three
parallel iterative solvers for the Stokes system, discretized by low order
tetrahedral elements, are compared with respect to their numerical efficiency
and their scalability running on up to $786\,432$ parallel threads. A genuine
multigrid method for the saddle point system using an Uzawa-type smoother
provides the best overall performance with respect to memory consumption and
time-to-solution. The largest system solved on a Blue Gene/Q system has more
than ten trillion ($1.1 \cdot 10 ^{13}$) unknowns and requires about 13 minutes
compute time. Despite the matrix free and highly optimized implementation, the
memory requirement for the solution vector and the auxiliary vectors is about
200 TByte. Brandt's notion of ""textbook multigrid efficiency"" is employed to
study the algorithmic performance of iterative solvers. A recent extension of
this paradigm to ""parallel textbook multigrid efficiency"" makes it possible to
assess also the efficiency of parallel iterative solvers for a given hardware
architecture in absolute terms. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated
for simulating incompressible fluid flow in a pipe filled with spherical
obstacles.

random component (also called the intra-event uncertainty) of a ground-motion
relation (GMR), as well as a novel approach to estimating the corresponding
parameters. In essence, I contend that the individual random component is
reproduced adequately by a simple stochastic mechanism of random impulses
acting in the horizontal plane, with random directions. The random number of
impulses was Poisson distributed. The parameters of the model were estimated
according to a proposal by Raschke (2013a), with the sample of random
difference xi=ln(Y1)-ln(Y2), in which Y1 and Y2 are the horizontal components
of local ground-motion intensity. Any GMR element was eliminated by
subtraction, except the individual random components. In the estimation
procedure the distribution of difference xi was approximated by combining a
large Monte Carlo simulated sample and Kernel smoothing. The estimated model
satisfactorily fitted the difference xi of the sample of peak ground
accelerations, and the variance of the individual random components was
considerably smaller than that of conventional GMRs. In addition, the
dependence of variance on the epicentre distance was considered; however, a
dependence of variance on the magnitude was not detected. Finally, the
influence of the novel model and the corresponding approximations on PSHA was
researched. The applied approximations of distribution of the individual random
component were satisfactory for the researched example of PSHA.

This paper is motivated by our previous work where in a QLC model we predicted
the value for $\theta_{13}^{pmns}=(9{^{+1}_{-2}})^\circ$, which was found to be
in strong agreement with the experimental results. In the QLC model the
non-trivial correlation between CKM and PMNS mixing matrices is given by a
correlation matrix ($V_{c}$). We do numerical simulation and estimate the
texture of the $V_{c}$ and in our findings we get a small deviation from the
Tri-Bi-Maximal (TBM) texture and a large from the Bi-Maximal one, which is
consistent with the work already reported in literature. In the further
investigation we obtain quite constrained limits for
$sin^2{\theta_{23}^{pmns}}= 0.4235_{-0.0043}^{+0.0032}$ that is narrower to the
existing ones. We also obtain the constrained limits for the three CP violating

computation to a set of asymptotic boundary conditions that, while still
gathering the WAdS$_3$ black holes, also allow for new solutions that are not
locally equivalent to WAdS$_3$ space, and therefore are associated to the local
degrees of freedom of the theory (bulk massive gravitons). After presenting
explicit examples of such geometries, we compute the asymptotic charge algebra
and show that it is generated by the semi-direct sum of Virasoro algebra and an
affine Kac-Moody algebra. The value of the central charge turns out to be
exactly the one that leads to reproduce the entropy of the WAdS$_3$ black

decoding of polar codes. In particular, using the fact that splitting may be
unnecessary when the reliability of decoding the unfrozen bit is sufficiently
high, a novel splitting rule is proposed. Based on this rule, it is conjectured
that, if the correct path survives at some stage, it tends to survive till
termination without splitting with high probability. On the other hand, the
incorrect paths are more likely to split at the following stages. Motivated by
these observations, a simple counter that counts the successive number of
stages without splitting is introduced for each decoding path to facilitate the
identification of correct and incorrect path. Specifically, any path with
counter value larger than a predefined threshold \omega is deemed to be the
correct path, which will survive at the decoding stage, while other paths with
counter value smaller than the threshold will be pruned, thereby reducing the
decoding complexity. Furthermore, it is proved that there exists a unique
unfrozen bit u_{N-K_1+1}, after which the successive cancellation decoder
achieves the same error performance as the maximum likelihood decoder if all
the prior unfrozen bits are correctly decoded, which enables further complexity
reduction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed low complexity SCL
decoder attains performance similar to that of the conventional SCL decoder,
while achieving substantial complexity reduction.

(MMWC). As the multipath components (MPCs) have different steering angles and
independent fadings, beamforming aims at achieving array gain as well as
diversity gain in this scenario. A sub-optimal beamforming scheme is proposed
to find the antenna weight vectors (AWVs) at Tx/Rx via iterative eigenvalue
decomposition (EVD), provided that full channel state information (CSI) is
available at both the transmitter and receiver. To make this scheme practically
feasible in MMWC, a corresponding training approach is suggested to avoid the
channel estimation and iterative EVD computation. As in fast fading scenario
the training approach may be time-consuming due to frequent training, another
beamforming scheme, which exploits the quasi-static steering angles in MMWC, is
proposed to reduce the overhead and increase the system reliability by
multipath grouping (MPG). The scheme first groups the MPCs and then
concurrently beamforms towards multiple steering angles of the grouped MPCs, so
that both array gain and diversity gain are achieved. Performance comparisons
show that, compared with the corresponding state-of-the-art schemes, the
iterative EVD scheme with the training approach achieves the same performance
with a reduced overhead and complexity, while the MPG scheme achieves better
performance with an approximately equivalent complexity.

period in the recent decades and appears to undergo an important transition in
its evolution. Aims: We aim at investigating the spectral type evolution of
this star over the recent decades as well as during one pulsation cycle in more
detail and discuss it in connection with the period evolution. Methods: We
present optical, near- and mid-IR low-resolution as well as optical
high-resolution spectra to determine the current spectral type. The optical
spectrum of LX Cyg has been followed for more than one pulsation cycle. Recent
spectra are compared to archival spectra to trace the spectral type evolution
and a Spitzer mid-IR spectrum is analysed for the presence of molecular and
dust features. Furthermore, the current period is derived from AAVSO data.
Results: It is found that the spectral type of LX Cyg changed from S to C
sometime between 1975 and 2008. Currently, the spectral type C is stable during
a pulsation cycle. It is shown that spectral features typical of C-type stars
are present in its spectrum from ~0.5 to 14 $\mu{\rm{m}}$. An emission feature
at 10.7 $\mu{\rm{m}}$ is attributed to SiC grains. The period of LX Cyg has
increased from ~460 d to ~580 d within only 20 years, and is stable now.
Conclusions: We conclude that the change in spectral type and the increase in
pulsation period happened simultaneously and are causally connected. Both a
recent thermal pulse (TP) and a simple surface temperature decrease appear
unlikely to explain the observations. We therefore suggest that the underlying
mechanism is related to a recent third dredge-up mixing event that brought up
carbon from the interior of the star, i.e. that a genuine abundance change
happened. We propose that LX Cyg is a rare transition type object that is
uniquely suited to study the transformation from O- to C-rich stars in detail.

diseases. We point out that very similar systems play an important role in
population ecology. Specifically we study a meta food-web model that was
recently proposed by Pillai et al. This model describes a network of species
connected by feeding interactions, which spread over a network of spatial
patches. Focusing on the essential case, where the network of feeding
interactions is a chain, we develop an analytical approach for the computation
of the degree distributions of colonized spatial patches for the different
species in the chain. This framework allows us to address ecologically relevant
questions. Considering configuration model ensembles of spatial networks, we
find that there is an upper bound for the fraction of patches that a given
species can occupy, which depends only on the networks mean degree. For a given
mean degree there is then an optimal degree distribution that comes closest to
the upper bound. Notably scale-free degree distributions perform worse than
more homogeneous degree distributions if the mean degree is sufficiently high.
Because species experience the underlying network differently the optimal
degree distribution for one particular species is generally not the optimal
distribution for the other species in the same food web. These results are of
interest for conservation ecology, where, for instance, the task of selecting
areas of old-growth forest to preserve in an agricultural landscape, amounts to
the design of a patch network.

outflow of which we only see the near side. Although most AGNs show near
simultaneity of IR variability, there was at least one epoch when NGC 4151
showed the sharply increasing IR lag with the increase of the wavelength. This

  Multicore Processors",,,,,"cs.MS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dense linear algebra libraries, such as BLAS and LAPACK, provide a relevant
collection of numerical tools for many scientific and engineering applications.
While there exist high performance implementations of the BLAS (and LAPACK)
functionality for many current multi-threaded architectures,the adaption of
these libraries for asymmetric multicore processors (AMPs)is still pending. In
this paper we address this challenge by developing an asymmetry-aware
implementation of the BLAS, based on the BLIS framework, and tailored for AMPs
equipped with two types of cores: fast/power hungry versus slow/energy
efficient. For this purpose, we integrate coarse-grain and fine-grain
parallelization strategies into the library routines which, respectively,
dynamically distribute the workload between the two core types and statically
repartition this work among the cores of the same type.
  Our results on an ARM big.LITTLE processor embedded in the Exynos 5422 SoC,
using the asymmetry-aware version of the BLAS and a plain migration of the
legacy version of LAPACK, experimentally assess the benefits, limitations, and
potential of this approach.

900 {\mu}m and aperture width 300 {\mu}m induces a modulation of bunch-to-bunch
spacing ~100 {\mu}m to the bunch with 2.4% correlated energy spread. With the
designed slit mask and a 3 ps bunch, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations,
including nonlinear energy distributions, space charge force, and coherent
synchrotron radiation (CSR) effect, also result in beam modulation with
bunch-to-bunch distance around 100 {\mu}m and a corresponding modulation
frequency of 3 THz. The beam modulation has been extensively examined with
three different beam conditions, 2.25 ps (0.25 nC), 3.25 ps (1 nC), and 4.75 ps
(3.2 nC) by tracking code Elegant. The simulation analysis indicates that the
sliced beam by the slit-mask with 3 ~ 6% correlated energy spread has
modulation lengths about 187 {\mu}m (0.25 nC), 270 {\mu}m (1 nC) and 325 {\mu}m

investigate the dynamic behaviour of the passive coupling of adjacent
structures. However, few papers have used optimization techniques with
guaranteed convergence in order to increase the efficiency of the passive
coupling of adjacent structures. In this paper, the combined problem of optimal
arrangement and mechanical properties of dampers placed between two adjacent
buildings is considered. A new bi-level optimization approach is presented. The
outer-loop of the approach optimizes damper configuration and is solved using
the ``inserting dampers'' method, which was recently shown to be a very
effective heuristic method. Under the assumption that the dampers have varying
damper coefficients, the inner-loop finds the optimal damper coefficients by
solving an $n$-dimensional optimization problem, where derivative information
of the objective function is not available. Three different non-gradient
methods are compared for solving the inner loop: a genetic algorithm (GA), the
mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm, and the robust approximate
gradient sampling (RAGS) algorithm. It is shown that by exploiting this new
bi-level problem formulation, modern derivative free optimization techniques
with guaranteed convergence (such as MADS and RAGS) can be used. The results
indicate a great increase in the efficiency of the retrofitting system, as well
as the existence of a threshold on the number of dampers inserted with respect
to the efficiency of the retrofitting system.

procedures which aim to reduce error in solution functionals. While adjoint
methods have been proven effective for functional-based adaptation, the
practical implementation of an adjoint method can be quite burdensome since
code developers constantly need to ensure and maintain a dual consistent
discretization as updates are made. Also, since most engineering problems
consider multiple functionals, an adjoint solution must be obtained for each
functional of interest which can increase the overall computational cost
significantly. In this paper, an alternative to adjoints is presented which
uses a sparse approximate inverse of the Jacobian of the residual to obtain
approximate adjoint sensitivities for functional-based adaptation indicators.
Since the approximate inverse need only be computed once, it can be recycled
for any number of functionals making the new approach more efficient than a
conventional adjoint method. This new method for functional-based adaptation
will be tested using the quasi-1D nozzle problem, and results are presented for

work, we start from the alignment in sensitivity of ROC and recall of
precision-recall curve, and propose an evaluation metric focusing on the
ability of a model to be adopted by biologists. This metric evaluates the
ability of a machine learning algorithm to predict only new interactions,
meanwhile, it eliminates the influence of test dataset. In the experiment of
evaluating different classifiers with a same data set and evaluating the same
predictor with different datasets, our new metric fulfills the evaluation task
of our interest while two widely recognized metrics, ROC and precision-recall
curve fail the tasks for different reasons.

propose the Poisson gamma belief network (PGBN) that factorizes each of its
layers into the product of a connection weight matrix and the nonnegative real
hidden units of the next layer. The PGBN's hidden layers are jointly trained
with an upward-downward Gibbs sampler, each iteration of which upward samples
Dirichlet distributed connection weight vectors starting from the first layer
(bottom data layer), and then downward samples gamma distributed hidden units
starting from the top hidden layer. The gamma-negative binomial process
combined with a layer-wise training strategy allows the PGBN to infer the width
of each layer given a fixed budget on the width of the first layer. The PGBN
with a single hidden layer reduces to Poisson factor analysis. Example results
on text analysis illustrate interesting relationships between the width of the
first layer and the inferred network structure, and demonstrate that the PGBN,
whose hidden units are imposed with correlated gamma priors, can add more
layers to increase its performance gains over Poisson factor analysis, given
the same limit on the width of the first layer.

magnetically bound vorton pairs, briefly introduced here, predicts the
existence of a complete family of magnetically charged particles, as well as
their neutral isotopic partners (all counterparts to the SM elementary
particles), in which the lowest mass (charged) particle would be an
electrically neutral stable lepton, but which carries a magnetic charge
equivalent to 1e. This new particle, which we call a magneticon (a counterpart
to the electron) would be pair produced at all e+e- colliders at an Ecm above
twice its mass. In addition, PP and PPbar colliders should also be able to
produce these new particles through the Drell-Yan process. To our knowledge, no
monopole search experiment has been sensitive to such a low-charged magnetic
monopole above a particle mass of about 5 GeV/c2. Hence, we propose that a
search for such a stable particle of magnetic charge 1e should be undertaken.
We have taken the ATLAS detector at the LHC as an example in which this search
might be done. To this end, we have modeled the magnetic fields and muon
trigger chambers of this detector. We show results from a simple Monte Carlo
simulation program to indicate how these particles might look in the detector
and describe how one might search for these new particles in the ATLAS data
stream.

by a new approach to generating ``in-face"" directions at each iteration, as
well as through new choice rules for selecting between in-face and ``regular""
Frank-Wolfe steps. Our framework for generating in-face directions generalizes
the notion of away-steps introduced by Wolfe. In particular, the in-face
directions always keep the next iterate within the minimal face containing the
current iterate. We present computational guarantees for the new method that
trade off efficiency in computing near-optimal solutions with upper bounds on
the dimension of minimal faces of iterates. We apply the new method to the
matrix completion problem, where low-dimensional faces correspond to low-rank
matrices. We present computational results that demonstrate the effectiveness
of our methodological approach at producing nearly-optimal solutions of very
low rank. On both artificial and real datasets, we demonstrate significant
speed-ups in computing very low-rank nearly-optimal solutions as compared to

Neither LRF nor EFM can be calculated from first principles due the lack of a
complete theory for turbulent eddies. Here the LRF and EFM for an idealized dry
atmosphere are computed by applying numerous localized weak forcings, one at a
time, to a GCM with Held-Suarez physics and calculating the mean-responses. The
LRF and EFM for zonally-averaged responses are then constructed using these
forcings and responses through matrix inversion. Tests demonstrate that LRF and
EFM are fairly accurate. Spectral analysis of the LRF shows that the most
excitable dynamical mode, the neutral vector, strongly resembles the model's
Annular Mode. The framework described here can be employed to compute the
LRF/EFM for zonally-asymmetric responses and more complex GCMs. The potential
applications of the LRF/EFM constructed here are i) forcing a specified
mean-flow for hypothesis-testing, ii) isolating/quantifying the eddy-feedbacks
in complex eddy-mean flow interaction problems, and iii) evaluating/improving
more generally-applicable methods currently used to construct LRFs or diagnose
eddy-feedbacks in comprehensive GCMs or observations. As an example for iii, in
Part 2, the LRF is also computed using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem

performs poorly in some cases. It is shown that dimension-reduction using
leading EOFs, which is commonly used to construct LRFs from the FDT, can
significantly degrade the accuracy due to the non-normality of the operator.

controlled by either tuning a global property, such as the packing fraction or
by applying shear strain, or at the micro-scale by tuning grain shape,
inter-particle friction or externally controlled organization. Here, we
introduce a novel way to change a local granular property by adding a weak
anisotropic magnetic interaction between particles. We measure the evolution of
the pressure, $P$, and coordination number, $Z$, for a packing of 2D
photo-elastic disks, subject to uniaxial compression. Some of the particles
have embedded cuboidal magnets. The strength of the magnetic interactions
between particles are too weak to have a strong direct effect on $P$ or $Z$
when the system is jammed. However, the magnetic interactions play an important
role in the evolution of latent force networks when systems containing a large
enough fraction of the particles with magnets are driven through unjammed
states. In this case, a statistically stable network of magnetic chains
self-organizes and overlaps with force chains, strengthening the granular
medium. We believe this property can be used to reversibly control mechanical
properties of granular materials.

prepare a density distribution where lattice sites are either empty or occupied

letting this disordered, out-of-equilibrium system evolve from a well-defined

inter-species interactions, a higher partial wave Feshbach resonance, and
excited Bloch-band population. When only the lighter fermions are allowed to
tunnel in the three-dimensional (3D) lattice, the system dynamics can be well
described by theory. However, in a regime where both fermions and bosons can
tunnel, we encounter correlated dynamics that is beyond the current capability
of numerical simulations. Furthermore, we show that we can probe the
microscopic distribution of the atomic gases in the lattice by measuring the
inelastic loss of doublons. These techniques realize tools that are generically
applicable to heteronuclear diatomic systems in optical lattices and can shed

we consider the edge as a quasi-one-dimensional quantum wire and describe it in
terms of a non-linear sigma model with a topological term. Neglecting
localization effects, we calculate the average distribution function of
transmission probabilities as a function of the sample length. We mainly focus
on the two experimentally relevant cases: a junction between two quantum Hall
(QH) states with different filling factors (unitary class) and a relatively
thick quantum well exhibiting quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect (symplectic
class). In a QH sample, the presence of topologically protected modes leads to
a strong suppression of diffusion in the other channels already at the scales
much shorter than the localization length. On the semiclassical level, this is
accompanied by the formation of a gap in the spectrum of transmission
probabilities close to unit transmission, thereby suppressing shot noise and
conductance fluctuations. In the case of a QSH system, there is at most one
topologically protected edge channel leading to weaker transport effects. In
order to describe `topological' suppression of nearly perfect transparencies,
we develop an exact mapping of the semiclassical limit of the one-dimensional
sigma model onto a zero-dimensional sigma model of a different symmetry class,
allowing us to identify the distribution of transmission probabilities with the
average spectral density of a certain random-matrix ensemble. We extend our
results to other symmetry classes with topologically protected edges in two

mass and momentum conservation are guaranteed on large scales, and results of
perturbation theory and the effective field theory can in principle be matched

model power spectrum is the halo stochasticity covariance, which has been
studied to a much lesser extent than other ingredients such as mass function,
bias, and profiles of halos. As written here, this approach still does not
describe the transition regime between perturbation theory and halo scales
realistically, which is left as an open problem. We also show explicitly that,
when implemented consistently, halo model predictions do not depend on any
properties of low-mass halos that are smaller than the scales of interest.

Our analytic calculations show that a DMC approaching a SMBH much closer than
the tidal radius undergoes significant compression along the axis perpendicular
to the orbital plane, shortly after pericenter passage. For DMCs composed of
self-annihilating dark-matter particles, we find that the boosted DMC density
and velocity dispersion lead to a flaring of the annihilation rate, most
pronounced for a velocity- dependent annihilation cross section. If the end
products of the annihilation are photons, this results in a gamma-ray flare,
detectable (and possibly already detected) by the Fermi telescope for a range
of model parameters. If the end products of dark-matter annihilation are
relativistic electrons and positrons and the local magnetic field is large
enough, TCEs of DMCs can lead to flares of synchrotron radiation. Finally, TCEs
of DMCs lead to a burst of gravitational waves, in addition to the ones
radiated by the orbital motion alone, and with a different frequency spectrum.
These transient phenomena provide interesting new avenues to explore the
properties of dark matter.

strength with scale using the two-point correlation function. We also
investigate how image boundary conditions and dust lanes affect the observed

orbital solution. Given the available data, it remains a challenge to reconcile
the observed properties of the combined light of LSR1610-0040AB with current
theoretical models of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. We present the results
of a joint fit to both astrometric and radial velocity measurements of this

$P = 633.0 \pm 1.7$ days, somewhat longer than previous results, with
eccentricity of $e = 0.42 \pm 0.03$, and we estimate that the semi-major axis
of the orbit of the primary is $a_1 \approx 0.32$ AU, consistent with previous
results. While a complete characterization of the system is limited by our
small number of radial velocity measurements, we establish a likely primary
mass range of $0.09 - 0.10 M_\odot$ from photometric and color-magnitude data.
For a primary mass in this range, the secondary is constrained to be $0.06 -
0.075 M_\odot$, making a negligible contribution to the total I-band
luminosity. This effectively rules out the possibility of the secondary being a
compact object such as an old, low-mass white dwarf. Based on our analysis, we
predict a likely angular separation at apoapsis comparable to the resolution
limits of current high-resolution imaging systems. Measuring the angular
separation of the A & B components would finally enable a full, unambiguous
solution for the masses of the components of this system.

star clusters starting with different structural and kinematical properties. We
show that the evolution of the radial anisotropy strength and its radial
variation within a cluster contain distinct imprints of the cluster initial
structural properties, dynamical history, and of the external tidal field of
its host galaxy. Initially isotropic and compact clusters with small initial
values of the ratio of the half-mass to Jacobi radius, $r_h/r_J$, develop a
strong radial anisotropy during their long-term dynamical evolution. Many
clusters, if formed with small values of $r_h/r_J$, should now be characterized
by a significant radial anisotropy increasing with the distance from the
cluster centre, reaching its maximum at a distance between 0.2 $r_J$ and 0.4
$r_J$, and then becoming more isotropic or mildly tangentially anisotropic in
the outermost regions. A similar radial variation of the anisotropy can also
result from an early violent relaxation phase. In both cases, as a cluster
continues its evolution and loses mass, the anisotropy eventually starts to
decrease and the system evolves toward an isotropic velocity distribution.
However, in order to completely erase the strong anisotropy developed by these
compact systems during their evolution, they must be in the advanced stages of
their evolution and lose a large fraction of their initial mass. Clusters that
are initially isotropic and characterized by larger initial values of
$r_h/r_J$, on the other hand, never develop a significant radial anisotropy.

everywhere type II or more special in the null alignment classification of
Coley et al., and (ii) the $3 \times 3$ matrix encoding the expansion, shear
and twist of the aligned null direction has rank 2. The dependence of the
solution on 2 coordinates is determined explicitly, so the Einstein equation
reduces to PDEs in the 3 remaining coordinates, just as for four-dimensional
algebraically special solutions. The solutions fall into several families. One
of these consists of warped products of four-dimensional algebraically special

individual halos in the context of the Multi-coupled Dark Energy (McDE)
scenario, which is characterised by the existence of two distinct dark matter
particle species with opposite couplings to a Dark Energy scalar field. We
compare the structural properties of the simulated halos to the standard
Lambda-CDM results. The zoomed-in initial conditions are set up using a
specifically designed code called ZInCo that we publicly release along with the
present paper. Our numerical results allow to investigate in detail and with
unprecedented resolution the halo segregation process that characterises McDE
cosmologies from its very early stages. In particular, we find that in contrast
to what could be inferred from previous numerical analysis at lower resolution,
the segregation process is already in place at redshifts as high as z ~ 7. Most
remarkably, we find that the subsequent evolution of the segregation leads to
the formation of cored total matter density profiles with a core size that
progressively increases in time. The shape of the cored profiles can be
accurately predicted as the superposition of two NFW profiles with an
increasing offset, thereby confirming the interpretation of the simulations
results in terms of the segregation of the two dark matter components of the
halo as a consequence of their different coupling to the Dark Energy field.

suggest that low-mass galaxies (log$_{10}$[M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$]<9.5) are likely
to remain star-forming unless they are affected by their local environment. To
test this premise, we compare and contrast the local environment of both
passive and star-forming galaxies as a function of stellar mass, using the
Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey. We find that passive fractions are higher in
both interacting pair and group galaxies than the field at all stellar masses,
and that this effect is most apparent in the lowest mass galaxies. We also find
that essentially all passive log$_{10}$[M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$]<8.5 galaxies are
found in pair/group environments, suggesting that local interactions with a
more massive neighbour cause them to cease forming new stars. We find that the
effects of immediate environment (local galaxy-galaxy interactions) in forming
passive systems increases with decreasing stellar mass, and highlight that this
is potentially due to increasing interaction timescales giving sufficient time
for the galaxy to become passive via starvation. We then present a simplistic
model to test this premise, and show that given our speculative assumptions, it
is consistent with our observed results.

fit the charge distribution of each orbital pair and use those fits wherever
they appear in the entire electron-electron (EE) interaction energy. The charge
distributions in quantum chemistry are typically represented as a sums over
products of Gaussian orbital basis functions. If fitted, they are also
represented as a sum over single-center Gaussian fitting basis functions. With
two representations of the charge distributions, the proper definition of
energy is ambiguous. To remedy this, we require that the variation of the
energy with respect to a product of orbitals generates a fitted potential. This
makes the quantum-mechanical energy robust, i.e. corrected to first order for
the error made using an incomplete fitting basis. The coupled orbital and
fitting equations are then the result of making the energy stationary with
respect to two independent sets of variables. We define the potentials and
unique energies for methods based on the Hartree Fock model and variationally
fit the full EE interaction in DFT. We compare implementations of variational
fitting in DFT at six different levels for three different functionals. Our
calculations are performed on transition metal atoms, for which first-order
Coulomb errors, due to an incomplete fitting basis sets, are significant.
Variational first-order exchange and correlation errors have similar magnitude

clearly observed from the splitting of streaks in reflection high-energy

Increasing deposition time will not lead to further increase in thickness,

the primary scintillation light with Xe and TMA mixture can be well
characterized by ~3% fluorescence transfer from Xe to TMA, with further
suppression due to TMA self-quenching. No evidence of the scintillation light

Wyner-Ziv setting where only a decoder has access to side information and the
distributed setting where independent encoders transmit over independent
channels to a central decoder. Prior work derived the necessary conditions for
optimality of the encoder and decoder mappings, along with a greedy
optimization algorithm that imposes these conditions iteratively, in
conjunction with the heuristic noisy channel relaxation method to mitigate poor
local minima. While noisy channel relaxation is arguably effective in simple
settings, it fails to provide accurate global optimization in more complicated
settings considered in this paper. We propose a powerful non-convex
optimization method based on the concept of deterministic annealing -- which is
derived from information theoretic principles and was successfully employed in
several problems including vector quantization, classification and regression.

Oshikawa and Hastings require that translationally invariant 2D spin systems

energy excitations, spontaneously break some symmetries, or exhibit topological
order with anyonic excitations. We establish a connection between these
constraints and a remarkably similar set of constraints at the surface of a 3D
interacting topological insulator. This, combined with recent work on
symmetry-enriched topological phases (SETs) with on-site unitary symmetries,
enables us to develop a framework for understanding the structure of SETs with
both translational and on-site unitary symmetries, including the effective
theory of symmetry defects. This framework places stringent constraints on the
possible types of symmetry fractionalization that can occur in 2D systems whose
unit cell contains fractional spin, fractional charge, or a projective
representation of the symmetry group. As a concrete application, we determine
when a topological phase must possess a ""spinon"" excitation, even in cases when
spin rotational invariance is broken down to a discrete subgroup by the crystal
structure. We also describe the phenomena of ""anyonic spin-orbit coupling"",
which may arise from the interplay of translational and on-site symmetries.
These include the possibility of on-site symmetry defect branch lines carrying
topological charge per unit length and lattice dislocations inducing on-site
symmetry protected degeneracies.

for stars other than the Sun because their surface is unresolved. In
particular, the effects of stellar surface inhomogeneities on observed stellar

optimal correction techniques to extract true stellar radial velocities is
extremely challenging. In this paper, we present preliminary results of a solar
telescope built to feed full-disk sunlight into the HARPS-N spectrograph, which
is in turn calibrated with an astro-comb. This setup enables long-term
observation of the Sun as a star with state-of-the-art sensitivity to radial
velocity changes. Over seven days of observing in 2014, we show an average
50\cms radial velocity rms over a few hours of observation. After correcting
observed radial velocities for spot and plage perturbations using full-disk
photometry of the Sun, we lower by a factor of two the weekly radial velocity
rms to 60\cms. The solar telescope is now entering routine operation, and will
observe the Sun every clear day for several hours. We will use these radial
velocities combined with data from solar satellites to improve our
understanding of stellar noise and develop optimal correction methods. If
successful, these new methods should enable the detection of Venus over the

Earth-twins around other solar-like stars using the radial velocity technique.

concentration. In this paper, we investigate the structural origins of binding
affinity and allosteric cooperativity of binding two calcium ions to each
domain of calmodulin (CaM) through simulations of a simple coarse-grained
model. In this model, the protein's conformational transitions between open and
closed conformational ensembles are simulated explicitly and ligand binding and
unbinding is treated implicitly within the Grand Canonical Ensemble. Ligand
binding is cooperative because the binding sites are coupled through a shift in
the dominant conformational ensemble upon binding. The classic
Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allostery with appropriate binding free energy to
the open and closed ensembles accurately describes the simulated binding
thermodynamics. The simulations predict that the two domains of CaM have
distinct binding affinity and cooperativity. In particular, C-terminal domain
binds calcium with higher affinity and greater cooperativity than the
N-terminal domain. From a structural point of view, the affinity of an
individual binding loop depends sensitively on the loop's structural
compatibility with the ligand in the bound ensemble, as well as the
conformational flexibility of the binding site in the unbound ensemble.

it follows a set of power laws, including the three-parameter Zipf's law on the

spectral efficiency by beamforming to multiple users at the same time. However,
multiuser beamforming requires channel state information (CSI) at the
transmitter, which leads to training overhead and reduces overall achievable
spectral efficiency. In this paper, we propose and analyze a sequential
beamforming strategy that utilizes full-duplex base station to implement
downlink data transmission concurrently with CSI acquisition via in-band closed

improve the spectral efficiency of uni-directional traffic, by leveraging it to
reduce the control overhead of CSI estimation. In moderate SNR regimes, we
analytically derive tight approximations for the optimal training duration and
characterize the associated respective spectral efficiency. We further
characterize the enhanced multiplexing gain performance in the high SNR regime.
In both regimes, the performance of the proposed full-duplex strategy is
compared to the half-duplex counterpart to quantify spectral efficiency
improvement. With experimental data [1] and 3D channel model [2] from 3GPP, in

first-order gravitational correction to the superfluid order parameter is given

the entanglement entropy bound. When the entanglement entropy bound is

this debate and provide reliable evolutionary classification. Integral field
spectrograph observations with VLT MUSE of the cluster SH 2-266 are used to
analyze the nature of MWC 137. A collimated outflow is discovered that is
geometrically centered on MWC 137. The central position of MWC 137 in the
cluster SH 2-266 within the larger nebula suggests strongly that it is a member
of this cluster and that it is both at the origin of the nebula and the newly
discovered jet. Comparison of the color-magnitude diagram of the brightest
cluster stars with stellar evolutionary models results in a distance of about
5.2$\pm$1.4 kpc. We estimate that the cluster is at least 3 Myr old. The jet
extends over 66"" (1.7 pc) projected on the plane of the sky, shows several
knots, and projected velocities of up to $\pm$450 km s$^{-1}$. From the Balmer
emission line decrement of the diffuse intracluster nebulosity we determine
E(B-V)=1.4 mag for the inner 1' cluster region. The spectral energy
distribution of the brightest cluster stars yield a slightly lower extinction
of E(B-V)~1.2 mag. The extinction towards MWC 137 is estimated to be E(B-V)~1.8
mag (A$_V$~5.6 mag). Our analysis of the optical and near-infrared
color-magnitude and color-color diagrams suggests a post-main sequence stage of

dielectric permittivity on the field-induced orientational order parameter.
Namely, the field-induced birefringence grows faster than the square of the
electric field; the dynamics of birefringence growth slows down as the field
increases. As a function of temperature, the field induced birefringence is
inversely proportional to the departure from an asymptotic critical

considered either when the bidder values are i.i.d, or when each bidder is

reasonable approach when the bidders can be classified into a few categories,
but there are many instances where the classification of bidders is a
continuum. For example, the classification of the bidders may be based on their
annual income, their propensity to buy an item based on past behavior, or in
the case of ad auctions, the click through rate of their ads. We introduce an
alternate model that captures this aspect, where bidders are a priori
identical, but can be distinguished based (only) on some side information the
auctioneer obtains at the time of the auction. We extend the sample complexity
approach of Dhangwatnotai et al. and Cole and Roughgarden to this model and
obtain almost matching upper and lower bounds. As an aside, we obtain a revenue

undergo conformational transitions upon addition of divalent salts over a wide
range of pH values below pKa: at low ionic strength, polybase brushes swell
upon salts addition; at high ionic strength, polybase brushes collapse with
salts addition. The extent and sensitive range of brushes conformational
transition induced by divalent ions are found to be grater and broader than

exploited. Therefore, we propose the framework of joint communication-motion
planning (JCMP) as well as the architecture for incorporating JCMP in WCRNs.
The proposed architecture is motivated by the observe-orient-decision-action
(OODA) model commonly adopted in robotic motion control and cognitive radio.
Then, we provide an overview of the orient module that quantify the
connectivity assessment. Afterwards, we highlight the JCMP module and compare
it with the conventional communication-planning, where the necessity of the
JCMP is validated via both theoretical analysis and simulation results of an
illustrative example. Finally, a series of open problems are discussed, which
picture the gap between the state-of-the-art and a practical WCRN.

children's books. Unlike standard language modelling benchmarks, it
distinguishes the task of predicting syntactic function words from that of
predicting lower-frequency words, which carry greater semantic content. We
compare a range of state-of-the-art models, each with a different way of
encoding what has been previously read. We show that models which store
explicit representations of long-term contexts outperform state-of-the-art
neural language models at predicting semantic content words, although this
advantage is not observed for syntactic function words. Interestingly, we find
that the amount of text encoded in a single memory representation is highly
influential to the performance: there is a sweet-spot, not too big and not too
small, between single words and full sentences that allows the most meaningful
information in a text to be effectively retained and recalled. Further, the
attention over such window-based memories can be trained effectively through
self-supervision. We then assess the generality of this principle by applying
it to the CNN QA benchmark, which involves identifying named entities in
paraphrased summaries of news articles, and achieve state-of-the-art

three-dimensional Dirac fermion systems at low temperature taking account of
screening of electron-acoustic phonon interaction. P is studied as a function
of electron temperature T_e and electron concentration n_e. Screening is found
to suppress P very significantly for about T_e < 0.5 K and its effect reduces
considerably for about T_e > 1K in Cd_3As_2 . In Bloch-Gruniesen (BG) regime,
for screened (unscreened) case T_e dependence is P ~ T_e^ 9 (T_e^ 5) and ne
dependence gives P ~ n_e ^-5/3(n_e^-1/3). The T_e dependence is characteristics
of 3D phonons and n_e dependence is characteristics of 3D Dirac fermions. In BG
regime, screening effect is found to enhance for larger n_e. Screening is found
to reduce the range of validity of BG regime temperature. Plot of P / T_e^ 4 vs
T_e shows a maximum at temperature T_e m which shifts to higher values for
larger n_e. Interesting observation is that maximum of P / T_e^4 is nearly same
for different n_e and T_em / n_e^ 1/3 appears to be nearly constant. More
importantly, we propose, the n_e dependent measurements of P would provide a
clearer signature to identify 3D Dirac semimetal phase.

and set-multilinear branching programs with the aim of showing lower bound
results. We define some natural restrictions of these models for which we are
able to show lower bound results. Some of our results extend existing lower
bounds, while others are new and raise open questions. More specifically, our
main results are the following:
  (1) We observe that set-multilinear arithmetic circuits can be transformed
into shallow set-multilinear circuits efficiently, similar to depth reduction
results of [VSBR83,RY08] for more general commutative circuits. As a
consequence, we note that polynomial size set-multilinear circuits have
quasi-polynomial size set-multilinear branching programs. We show that
\emph{narrow} set-multilinear ABPs (with a restricted number of set types)
computing the Permanent polynomial $\mathrm{PER}_n$ require $2^{n^{\Omega(1)}}$
size. A similar result for general set-multilinear ABPs appears difficult as it
would imply that the Permanent requires superpolynomial size set-multilinear
circuits. It would also imply that the noncommutative Permanent requires
superpolynomial size noncommutative arithmetic circuits.
  (2) Indeed, we also show that set-multilinear branching programs are
exponentially more powerful than \emph{interval} multilinear circuits (where
the index sets for each gate is restricted to be an interval w.r.t.\ some
ordering), assuming the sum-of-squares conjecture. This further underlines the
power of set-multilinear branching programs.
  (3) Finally, we consider set-multilinear circuits with restrictions on the
number of proof trees of monomials computed by it, and prove exponential lower
bounds results. This raises some new lower bound questions.

fields of view has become one of the most interesting and challenging subjects
in the area of intelligent video surveillance. Although several methods have
been developed and proposed, certain limitations and unresolved issues remain.
In all of the existing re-identification approaches, feature vectors are
extracted from segmented still images or video frames. Different similarity or
dissimilarity measures have been applied to these vectors. Some methods have
used simple constant metrics, whereas others have utilised models to obtain
optimised metrics. Some have created models based on local colour or texture
information, and others have built models based on the gait of people. In
general, the main objective of all these approaches is to achieve a
higher-accuracy rate and lowercomputational costs. This study summarises
several developments in recent literature and discusses the various available
methods used in person re-identification. Specifically, their advantages and
disadvantages are mentioned and compared.

PerfMatch of counting perfect matchings in a given input graph $G$. These
generalize the well-known tractable planar case, and they include the genus of
$G$, its apex number (the minimum number of vertices whose removal renders $G$
planar), and its Hadwiger number (the size of a largest clique minor).
  To study these parameters, we first introduce the notion of combined
matchgates, a general technique that bridges parameterized counting problems
and the theory of so-called Holants and matchgates: Using combined matchgates,
we can simulate certain non-existing gadgets $F$ as linear combinations of
$t=O(1)$ existing gadgets. If a graph $G$ features $k$ occurrences of $F$, we
can then reduce $G$ to $t^k$ graphs that feature only existing gadgets, thus
enabling parameterized reductions.
  As applications of this technique, we simplify known $4^g n^{O(1)}$ time
algorithms for PerfMatch on graphs of genus $g$. Orthogonally to this, we show
#W[1]-hardness of the permanent on $k$-apex graphs, implying its #W[1]-hardness
under the Hadwiger number. Additionally, we rule out $n^{o(k/\log k)}$ time
algorithms under the counting exponential-time hypothesis #ETH.
  Finally, we use combined matchgates to prove parity-W[1]-hardness of
evaluating the permanent modulo $2^k$, complementing an $O(n^{4k-3})$ time
algorithm by Valiant and answering an open question of Bj\""orklund. We also
obtain a lower bound of $n^{\Omega(k/\log k)}$ under the parity version of the
exponential-time hypothesis.

tensor computation and numerical multilinear algebra. This paper is devoted to
a semi-definite program algorithm for computing the maximum $H$-eigenvalue of a
class of tensors with sign structure called $W$-tensors. The class of
$W$-tensors extends the well-studied nonnegative tensors and essentially
nonnegative tensors, and covers some important tensors arising naturally from
spectral hypergraph theory. Our algorithm is based on a new structured
sums-of-squares (SOS) decomposition result for a nonnegative homogeneous
polynomial induced by a $W$-tensor. This SOS decomposition enables us to show
that computing the maximum $H$-eigenvalue of an even order symmetric $W$-tensor
is equivalent to solving a semi-definite program, and hence can be accomplished
in polynomial time. Numerical examples are given to illustrate that the
proposed algorithm can be used to find maximum $H$-eigenvalue of an even order
symmetric $W$-tensor with dimension up to $10,000$. We present two applications
for our proposed algorithm: we first provide a polynomial time algorithm for
computing the maximum $H$-eigenvalues of large size Laplacian tensors of
hyper-stars and hyper-trees; second, we show that the proposed SOS algorithm
can be used to test the copositivity of a multivariate form associated with
symmetric extended $Z$-tensors, whose order may be even or odd. Numerical
experiments illustrate that our structured semi-definite program algorithm is
effective and promising.

objects with an internal structure. We present in full generality the steps
needed to describe the viscous jets around their central line, and we argue
that the Taylor expansion of all fields around that line is conveniently
expressed in terms of symmetric trace-free tensors living in the two dimensions
of the fiber sections. We recover the standard results of axisymmetric jets and
we report the first and second corrections to the lowest order description,
also allowing for a rotational component around the axis of symmetry. When
applied to generally curved fibers, the lowest order description corresponds to
a viscous string model with circular sections. However, when including the
first corrections we find that curved jets generically develop elliptic
sections. Several subtle effects imply that the first corrections cannot be
described by a rod model, since it amounts to selectively discard some
corrections. For completeness, we also recover the constitutive relations for
forces and torques in rod models and exhibit a missing term in the lowest order
expression of viscous torque. Given that our method is based on tensors, the
complexity of all computations has been beaten down by using an appropriate
tensor algebra package such as {\it xAct}, allowing us to obtain a
one-dimensional description of curved viscous jets with all the first order
corrections consistently included. Finally, we find a description for straight
fibers with elliptic sections as a special case of these results, and recover
that ellipticity is dynamically damped by surface tension. An application to
toroidal viscous fibers is presented in the companion paper [Pitrou, Phys. Rev.

decrypted with probability one in principle by the Brute force attack in which
an eavesdropper tries all the possible keys based on the correct ciphertext and
some known plaintext. A cipher with quantum effects in physical layer may
protect the system from the Brute force attack by means of the quantum no

randomizations for the ciphertext which is the output from the mathematical

estimation of the order of a Markov chain from a given symbol sequence is an
open issue, especially when the order is moderately large. Here, parametric
significance tests of conditional mutual information (CMI) of increasing order
$m$, $I_c(m)$, on a symbol sequence are conducted for increasing orders $m$ in
order to estimate the true order $L$ of the underlying Markov chain. CMI of
order $m$ is the mutual information of two variables in the Markov chain being
$m$ time steps apart, conditioning on the intermediate variables of the chain.
The null distribution of CMI is approximated with a normal and gamma
distribution deriving analytic expressions of their parameters, and a gamma
distribution deriving its parameters from the mean and variance of the normal
distribution. The accuracy of order estimation is assessed with the three
parametric tests, and the parametric tests are compared to the randomization
significance test and other known order estimation criteria using Monte Carlo
simulations of Markov chains with different order $L$, length of symbol
sequence $N$ and number of symbols $K$. The parametric test using the gamma
distribution (with directly defined parameters) is consistently better than the

on a surface based on continuous piecewise linear approximation and gradient

gradient jump stabilization term is defined on the full faces of the
tetrahedra. The stabilization term serves two purposes: first the method is
stabilized and secondly the resulting linear system of equations is
algebraically stable. We establish stability results that are analogous to the
standard meshed flat case and prove $h^{3/2}$ order convergence in the natural
norm associated with the method and that the full gradient enjoys $h^{3/4}$

able to restore a focus, but it can also recover the injected polarization

an arbitrary rotation of the input polarization does not degrade the quality of
the focus. This unsupervised re-polarization - out of the originally scrambled

ADC takes advantages of TDMA and CSMA and guarantees that (1) each node can
fairly access channel based on its demand, (2) channel utilization can be
increased by reducing competition for channel access among neighboring nodes,
(3) every node has at least one rendezvous active time slot with each of its
neighboring nodes even under asynchronization. The latency bound of data
aggregation is analyzed under ADC to show that ADC can bound the latency under
both synchronization and asynchronization. We conduct extensive experiments in

fluid incurs the Joule effect. A current paradigm is that the corresponding
dissipation increases with the intensity of the magnetic field, and as a result
turbulent fluctuations are all the more damped as the magnetic field is strong.
While this idea finds apparent support in the phenomenology of decaying
turbulence, measurements of turbulence in duct flows and other, more complex
configurations have produced seemingly contradicting results. The root of the
controversy is that magnetic fields promote sufficient scale-dependent
anisotropy to profoundly reorganise the structure of turbulence, so their net
effect cannot be understood in terms of the additional dissipation only. Here
we show that when turbulence is forced in a magnetic field that acts on
turbulence itself rather than on the mechanisms that generate it, the field
promotes large, nearly 2D structures capturing sufficient energy to offset the
loss due to Joule dissipation, with the net effect of increasing the intensity
of turbulent fluctuations. This change of paradigm potentially carries
important consequences for systems as diverse as the liquid cores of planets,
accretion disks and a wide range of metallurgical and nuclear engineering
applications.

lasing properties of perovskite nanowire lasers via nano-manipulation. By
utilizing a tungsten probe, one nanowire has been lifted from the wafer and
re-positioned its two ends on two nearby perovskite blocks. Consequently, the
conventional Fabry-Perot lasers are completely suppressed and a single laser
peak has been observed. The corresponding numerical model reveals that the
single-mode lasing operation is formed by the whispering gallery mode in the
transverse plane of perovskite nanowire. Our research provides a simple way to

structure, similar to the well-defined shift operator in classical signal
processing, is a crucial problem in graph signal processing, since almost all
operations, such as filtering, transformation, prediction, are directly related
to the graph shift operator. We define a set of energy-preserving shift
operators that satisfy many properties similar to their counterparts in
classical signal processing. Our definition of the graph shift operator negates
the shift operators defined in the literature, such as the graph adjacency
matrix and Laplacian matrix based shift operators, which modify the energy of a
graph signal. We decouple the graph structure represented by eigengraphs and
the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix or the Laplacian matrix. We show that
the adjacency matrix of a graph is indeed a linear shift invariant (LSI) graph
filter with respect to the defined shift operator. We introduce graph finite
impulse response (GFIR) and graph infinite impulse response (GIIR) filters and
obtain explicit forms for such filters. We further define autocorrelation and
cross-correlation functions of signals on the graph, enabling us to obtain the
solution to the optimal filtering on graphs, i.e., the corresponding Wiener
filtering on graphs and the efficient spectra analysis and frequency domain
filtering in parallel with those in classical signal processing. This new shift
operator based GSP framework enables the signal analysis along a correlation
structure defined by a graph shift manifold as opposed to classical signal
processing operating on the assumption of the correlation structure with a
linear time shift manifold. We further provide the solution to the optimal
linear predictor problem over general graphs. Several illustrative simulations
are presented to validate the performance of the optimal LSI filters.

The partition
function is first expressed in the reciprocal space, it is argued that the
links (p,q) between 2 molecules can reasonably in the thermodynamical limit be
considered as a set nearly independent objects characterized by the dynamical
variables . It is then possible to derive an expression of the pair correlation
function. The results, which are independent of the exact shape of the
intermolecular potential, are applied to the simple case of hard sphere fluids.

has reduced the gaps among the individuals. Previously communication was a time
consuming and expensive task between the people. Social Media has earned fame
because it is a cheaper and faster communication provider. Besides, social
media has allowed us to reduce the gaps of physical distance, it also generates
and preserves huge amount of data. The data are very valuable and it presents
association degree between people and their opinions. The comprehensive
analysis of the methods which are used on user behavior prediction is presented
in this paper. This comparison will provide a detailed information, pros and
cons in the domain of sentiment and opinion mining.
