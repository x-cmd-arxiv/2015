dissipative tensor and hence the Hall angle become helicity dependent. The
skyrmion position and helicity dynamics are fully characterized by our model in
two particular examples of engineered DMI coupling: half-planes with
opposite-sign DMI and linearly varying DMI. In light of the experiment of

output sentences as sequences of characters rather than words. Since word-level
information provides a crucial source of bias, our input model composes
representations of character sequences into representations of words (as
determined by whitespace boundaries), and then these are translated using a
joint attention/translation model. In the target language, the translation is
modeled as a sequence of word vectors, but each word is generated one character
at a time, conditional on the previous character generations in each word. As
the representation and generation of words is performed at the character level,
our model is capable of interpreting and generating unseen word forms. A
secondary benefit of this approach is that it alleviates much of the challenges
associated with preprocessing/tokenization of the source and target languages.
We show that our model can achieve translation results that are on par with
conventional word-based models.

The precessional mechanism, typical for solids, is due to the condensate
displacement. The unconventional ""anomalous"" mechanism is due to the
spin-dependent velocity producing the distribution of the condensate spin
polarization. The condensate expansion is accompanied by a random displacement
and fragmentation, where it becomes sparse, as clearly revealed in the spin
dynamics. Thus, different stages of the evolution can be characterized by
looking at the condensate spin.

has attracted a great amount of attention recently. Rapid progress has been
made in terms of both developing novel algorithms and releasing new datasets.
Indeed, the state-of-the-art results on some of the standard datasets have been
pushed into the regime where it has become more and more difficult to make
significant improvements. Instead of proposing new models, this work
investigates the possibility of empirically establishing performance upper
bounds on various visual captioning datasets without extra data labelling
effort or human evaluation. In particular, it is assumed that visual captioning
is decomposed into two steps: from visual inputs to visual concepts, and from
visual concepts to natural language descriptions. One would be able to obtain
an upper bound when assuming the first step is perfect and only requiring
training a conditional language model for the second step. We demonstrate the
construction of such bounds on MS-COCO, YouTube2Text and LSMDC (a combination
of M-VAD and MPII-MD). Surprisingly, despite of the imperfect process we used
for visual concept extraction in the first step and the simplicity of the
language model for the second step, we show that current state-of-the-art
models fall short when being compared with the learned upper bounds.
Furthermore, with such a bound, we quantify several important factors
concerning image and video captioning: the number of visual concepts captured
by different models, the trade-off between the amount of visual elements
captured and their accuracy, and the intrinsic difficulty and blessing of
different datasets.

relies on the execution time of the flush instruction, which depends on whether

to any other cache attack. Thus, it causes no cache misses at all and the
number of cache hits is reduced to a minimum due to the constant cache flushes.
Therefore, Flush+Flush attacks are stealthy, i.e., the spy process cannot be
detected based on cache hits and misses, or state-of-the-art detection
mechanisms. The Flush+Flush attack runs in a higher frequency and thus is
faster than any existing cache attack. With 496 KB/s in a cross-core covert

conduction coefficient in two-dimensional lattices. It was reported that in
certain lattices with on-site potential, for which one-dimensional chain has
convergent conductivity, for the 2D case it turns out to diverge. We
demonstrate that this conclusion is an artifact caused by insufficient size of
the simulated system. To overcome computational restrictions, a ribbon of
relatively small width is simulated instead of the square specimen. It is
further demonstrated that the heat conduction coefficient in the ""long""
direction of the ribbon ceases to depend on the width, as the latter achieves
only 10 to 20 interparticle distances. So, one can consider the dynamics of
much longer systems, than in the traditional setting, and still can gain a
reliable information regarding the 2D lattice. It turns out that for all
considered models, for which the conductivity is convergent in the 1D case, it
is indeed convergent in the 2D case. In the same time, however, the length of
the system, necessary to reveal the convergence in the 2D case, may be much
bigger than in its 1D counterpart.

Talagrand established a lower bound on the correlation in terms of how much the
two families depend simultaneously on the same coordinates. Talagrand's method

  In this paper we present stronger correlation lower bounds that hold when the

leads to discriminative parts-based object features while DL seeks a more

to simultaneously maximize intra-class compactness and inter-class

\Ovi absorbing gas structures at high redshift using optical spectra with
intermediate ($\sim 6.6$ \kms FWHM) and high ($\sim 4.0$ \kms FWHM) resolution,
obtained with UVES/VLT. We complement our analysis with synthetic spectra
obtained from extensive cosmological simulations that are part of the OWLS
project (Schaye et al. 2010).
  Our main conclusions are:
  1) Both the observations and simulations imply that \Ovi absorbers at high
redshift arise in structures spanning a broad range of scales and different
physical conditions. When the \Ovi components are characterized by small
Doppler parameters, the ionizing mechanism is most likely photoionization;
otherwise, collisional ionization is the dominant mechanism.
  2) The baryon- and metal-content of the \Ovi absorbers at $z\approx2$ is less
than one per cent of the total mass-density of baryons and metals at that
redshift. Therefore, \Ovi absorbers do not trace the bulk of baryons and metals
at that epoch.
  3) The \Ovi gas density, metallicity and non-thermal broadening mechanisms
are significantly different at high redshift with respect to low redshift. In
particular, non-thermal broadening mechanisms appear less important at high
redshift as compared to low redshift, where the turbulence in the absorption
gas might be significant. This, together with the result that \Ovi arises in
different environments, embedded in small- and large-scale structures,
indicates that \Ovi does not trace characteristic regions in the circumgalactic
and intergalactic medium, but rather traces a gas phase with a characteristic
transition temperature ($T\sim10^{5}$K).
  4) The \Ovi absorbers at high redshift arise in gas with metallicities
significantly higher than the surrounding environment, which suggests an
inhomogeneous metal enrichment of the IGM.

different from the bulk behavior of single crystals: Yield strength increases
with decreasing size and plastic deformation comes together with strain bursts
or/and stress drops (depending on loading conditions) with a very strong
sensitivity of the stochasticity character on material preparation and
conditions. The character of the phenomenon is standing as a paradox: While
these bursts resemble the universal, widely independent of material conditions,
noise heard in bulk crystals using acoustic emission (AE) techniques, they
strongly emerge primarily with decreasing size and increasing strength in
nanopillars. In this paper, we present a realistic but minimal discrete
dislocation plasticity model for the elasto-plastic deformation of nanopillars
that is consistent with the main experimental observations of nano pillar
compression experiments and provides a clear insight to this paradox. With
increasing sample size, the model naturally transitions between the typical
progressive behavior of nanopillars to a behavior that resembles evidence for
bulk mesoscale plasticity. The combination of consistent strengthening, large
flow stress fluctuations and critical avalanches is only observed in the {\it
depinning regime} where obstacles are much stronger than dislocation sources;
in contrast, when dislocation source strength becomes comparable to obstacle
barriers, then yield strength size effects are absent but plasticity avalanche
dynamics is strongly universal, across sample width and aspect-ratio scales.
Finally, we elucidate the mechanism that leads to the connection between
depinning and size effects in our model dislocation dynamics. In this way, our
model builds a way towards unifying statistical aspects of mechanical
deformation across scales.

in which the graph topology $(V,E)$ is assumed to be public and the private
information consists only of the edge weights $w:E\to\mathbb{R}^+$. This can
express hiding congestion patterns in a known system of roads. Differential
privacy requires that the output of an algorithm provides little advantage,
measured by privacy parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, for distinguishing
between neighboring inputs, which are thought of as inputs that differ on the
contribution of one individual. In our model, two weight functions $w,w'$ are
considered to be neighboring if they have $\ell_1$ distance at most one.
  We study the problems of privately releasing a short path between a pair of
vertices and of privately releasing approximate distances between all pairs of
vertices. We are concerned with the approximation error, the difference between
the length of the released path or released distance and the length of the
shortest path or actual distance.
  For privately releasing a short path between a pair of vertices, we prove a
lower bound of $\Omega(|V|)$ on the additive approximation error for fixed
$\epsilon,\delta$. We provide a differentially private algorithm that matches
this error bound up to a logarithmic factor and releases paths between all
pairs of vertices. The approximation error of our algorithm can be bounded by
the number of edges on the shortest path, so we achieve better accuracy than
the worst-case bound for vertex pairs that are connected by a low-weight path
with $o(|V|)$ vertices.
  For privately releasing all-pairs distances, we show that for trees we can
release all distances with approximation error $O(\log^{2.5}|V|)$ for fixed
privacy parameters. For arbitrary bounded-weight graphs with edge weights in
$[0,M]$ we can release all distances with approximation error
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{|V|M})$.

builds on empirical and composite likelihood, taking advantage of the strengths
of each. Specifically, from empirical likelihood we borrow the ability to avoid

driven by computer at a fixed speed. Based on the collected data the
distributions of the headway distance, the car velocity, acceleration, and jerk
are constructed and compared with the available experimental data for the real
traffic flow. A new model for the car-following is proposed to capture the
found properties. As the main result, we draw a conclusion that human actions
in car driving should be categorized as generalized intermittent control with
noise-driven activation. Besides, we hypothesize that the car jerk together
with the car acceleration are additional phase variables required for
describing the dynamics of car motion governed by human drivers.

emission lines on astronomical spectra, especially in the near infrared, that
need to be removed before analysing the affected wavelength regions. These
lines are typically removed by comparison to A- or B-type stars used as
telluric standards that themselves have strong hydrogen lines, which
complicates the removal of telluric lines. We have developed a method to
circumvent that problem. For our IDL software package tellrem we used a recent
approach to model telluric absorption features with the line-by-line radiative
transfer model (LBLRTM). The broad wavelength coverage of the X-Shooter at VLT
allows us to expand their technique by determining the abundances of the most
important telluric molecules H2O, O2, CO2, and CH4 from sufficiently isolated
line groups. For individual observations we construct a telluric absorption
model for most of the spectral range that is used to remove the telluric
absorption from the object spectrum. We remove telluric absorption from both
continuum regions and emission lines without systematic residuals for most of
the processable spectral range; however, our method increases the statistical
errors. The errors of the corrected spectrum typically increase by 10% for
S/N~10 and by a factor of two for high-quality data (S/N~100), i.e. the method
is accurate on the percent level. Modelling telluric absorption can be an
alternative to the observation of standard stars for removing telluric
contamination.

peripheral sensor properties to behavior requires computational models of

stretch- and color-corrected fits of SN Ia light curves and assumed a resulting
fiducial mean and symmetric intrinsic dispersion for the resulting relative
luminosity. As systematics become the main contributors to the error budget, it
has become imperative to expand supernova cosmology analyses to include a more
general likelihood to model systematics to remove biases with losses in
precision. To illustrate an example likelihood analysis, we use a simple model
of two populations with a relative luminosity shift, independent intrinsic
dispersions, and linear redshift evolution of the relative fraction of each
population. Treating observationally viable two-population mock data using a
one-population model results in an inferred dark energy equation of state
parameter $w$ that is biased by roughly 2 times its statistical error for a
sample of N $ \gtrsim$ 2500 SNeIa. Modeling the two-population data with a
two-population model removes this bias at a cost of an approximately $\sim20\%$
increase in the statistical constraint on $w$. These significant biases can be
realized even if the support for two underlying SNeIa populations, in the form
of model selection criteria, is inconclusive. With the current
observationally-estimated difference in the two proposed populations, a sample
of N $ \gtrsim$ 10,000 SNeIa is necessary to yield conclusive evidence of two
populations.

is appealing to most application service providers to deliver their
applications in the cloud. Within this context, elasticity of applications has
become one of the most important features in cloud computing. This elasticity
enables real-time acquisition/release of compute resources to meet application
performance demands. In this thesis we investigate the problem of delivering
cost-effective elasticity services for cloud applications.
  Traditionally, the application level elasticity addresses the question of how
to scale applications up and down to meet their performance requirements, but
does not adequately address issues relating to minimising the costs of using
the service. With this current limitation in mind, we propose a scaling
approach that makes use of cost-aware criteria to detect the bottlenecks within
multi-tier cloud applications, and scale these applications only at bottleneck
tiers to reduce the costs incurred by consuming cloud infrastructure resources.
Our approach is generic for a wide class of multi-tier applications, and we
demonstrate its effectiveness by studying the behaviour of an example
electronic commerce site application.
  Furthermore, we consider the characteristics of the algorithm for
implementing the business logic of cloud applications, and investigate the
elasticity at the algorithm level: when dealing with large-scale data under
resource and time constraints, the algorithm's output should be elastic with
respect to the resource consumed. We propose a novel framework to guide the
development of elastic algorithms that adapt to the available budget while
guaranteeing the quality of output result, e.g. prediction accuracy for
classification tasks, improves monotonically with the used budget.

for inflationary gravitational waves. Measurements of large-scale B-modes of
the CMB are considered to be the best method for probing gravitational waves
from the cosmic inflation. Future CMB experiments will, however, suffer from
contamination by non-primordial B-modes, one source of which is the lensing
B-modes. Delensing, therefore, will be required for further improvement of the
detection sensitivity for gravitational waves. Analyzing the use of the
two-dimensional map of galaxy distribution provided by the SKA RC survey as a
lensing mass tracer, we find that joint delensing using near future CMB
experiments and the SKA phase 1 will improve the constraints on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio by more than a factor of $\sim 2$ compared to those
without the delensing analysis. Compared to the use of CMB data alone, the
inclusion of the SKA phase 1 data will increase the significance of the
constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio by a factor $1.2$-$1.6$. For LiteBIRD
combined with a ground-based experiment such as Simons Array and Advanced ACT,
the constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio when adding SKA phase 2 data is
improved by a factor of $2.3$-$2.7$, whereas delensing with CMB data alone
improves the constraints by only a factor $1.3$-$1.7$. We conclude that the use
of SKA data is a promising method for delensing upcoming CMB experiments such
as LiteBIRD.

nonlinear characteristics of Josephson junctions. The nonlinearity provides
quasi-periodic structure of the spectrum in both incident power and frequency.

This paper shows that deep activity recognition models (a) provide better

the most powerful tools for manipulating small particles, such as micron sized
beads or single atoms. The optical trapping mechanism is based on the
interaction energy of a dipole and the electric field of the laser light. In
atom trapping, the dominant contribution typically comes from the allowed
optical transition closest to the laser wavelength, whereas for mesoscopic
particles it is given by the bulk polarizability of the material. These two
different regimes of optical trapping have coexisted for decades without any
direct link, resulting in two very different contexts of applications: one
being the trapping of small objects mainly in biological settings, the other
one being dipole traps for individual neutral atoms in the field of quantum
optics. Here we show that for nanoscale diamond crystals containing artificial
atoms, so-called nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers, both regimes of optical
trapping can be observed at the same time even in a noisy liquid environment.
For wavelengths in the vicinity of the zero-phonon line transition of the color
centers, we observe a significant modification ($10\%$) of the overall trapping
strength. Most remarkably, our experimental findings suggest that owing to the
large number of artificial atoms, collective effects greatly contribute to the
observed trapping strength modification. Our approach adds the powerful
atomic-physics toolbox to the field of nano-manipulation.

conclusions have been drawn. In this work, using the abundancedecomposed
approach, we find that the metal-poor star HD 140283 is a weak r-process star.
Although this star is a weak r-process star, its Ba abundance mainly originates
from the main r-process. This is the reason that the ratio [Ba/Eu]= -0.58+-
0.15 for HD 140283 is close to the ratio of the main r-process. Based on the
comparison of the abundances in the six-weak r-process stars, we find that
their element abundances possess a robust nature. On the other hand, we find
that the robust nature of the abundance of the extreme main r-process stars
([r/Fe]>= 1.5) can be extended to the lighter neutron-capture elements.
Furthermore, the abundance characteristics of the weak r-process and main
r-process are investigated. The abundance robustness of the two category
r-process stars could be used as the constraint of the r-process theory and
could be used to investigate the astrophysical origins of the elements in the
metal-poor stars and population I stars.

the near IR spectra of medium resolution. Seven objects with T_eff above 2600K
are analyzed with the dust-free models. The M8.5 dwarf 2MASSI J1835379+325954
whose T_eff is 2275K is analyzed by the dusty model, in which the surface
temperature is higher by about 600K due to the blanketing effect of the dust,
and C and O abundances are higher by 0.25 and 0.15dex, respectively, compared
to the analysis by the dust-free model. Once dust forms in the photosphere, the
dust works as a kind of thermostat and temperatures of the surface layers
remain nearly the same as the condensation temperatures of the dust grains. For
this reason, the temperatures of the surface layers of the dusty dwarfs are not
sensitive to the fundamental parameters including T_eff. Also, 2MASS J1835379
+325954 is a rapid rotator, for which its EWs are thought to remain unchanged
by the rotational broadening. This is, however, true only when the true
continuum is well defined. Otherwise, the pseudo-continuum level depends on the
rotational velocity and hence the EWs as well. For this reason, the derived
abundances depend on the rotational velocity assumed: For the values of
V_rot*sin(i)=37.6 and 44.0km/s available in the literature, the derived C and O
abundances differ by 0.23 and 0.14dex, respectively, and we find that the
higher value provides a better account of the observed spectrum. The resulting
C and O abundances in our late M dwarfs show no systematic difference from our
results for the early and middle M dwarfs, and confirm the higher O/C ratio at
the lower metallicity. In late M dwarfs, CO and H2O remain as excellent
abundance indicators of C and O, respectively, except for additional
uncertainty due to the complexity associated with the dust formation in the
latest M dwarfs.

^{-1}$ and $P(X)= X^n+p_{n-1} X^{n-1}+\cdots$ is an arbitrary real polynomial
of degree $n$. This class contains the classical Carleman operator when $n =0$.
We show that a Hankel operator $H$ in this class can be reduced by an {\it
explicit} unitary transformation (essentially by the Mellin transform) to a
differential operator $A = v Q(D) v$ in the space $L^2 ({\Bbb R}) $. Here
$Q(X)= X^n+ q_{n-1} X^{n-1}+\cdots$ is a polynomial determined by $P(X)$ and
$v(\xi)=\pi^{1/2} (\cosh(\pi\xi))^{-1/2} $ is the universal function. Then the
operator $A = v Q(D) v$ reduces by the generalized Liouville transform to the
standard differential operator $B = D^n+ b_{n-1} (x)D^{n-1}+\cdots+ b_{0} (x)$
with the coefficients $b_{m}(x)$, $m=0,\ldots, n-1$, decaying sufficiently
rapidly as $|x|\to \infty$. This allows us to use the results of spectral
theory of differential operators for the study of spectral properties of
generalized Carleman operators. In particular, we show that the absolutely
continuous spectrum of $H$ is simple and coincides with $\Bbb R$ if $n$ is odd,
and it has multiplicity $2$ and coincides with $[0,\infty)$ if $n\geq 2$ is
even. The singular continuous spectrum of $H$ is empty, and its eigenvalues may
accumulate to the point $0$ only. As a by-product of our considerations, we
develop spectral theory of a new class of {\it degenerate} differential
operators $A = v Q(D) v$ where $Q(X)$ is an arbitrary real polynomial and
$v(\xi)$ is a sufficiently arbitrary real function decaying at infinity.

scales. A desired texture, within a scale range, is found by fitting a surface
to the local maximal responses in the spectral domain. A band above and below

application is proposed which can attenuate or enhance textures in the image in

we propose a macroblock (MB) level bit allocation method based on the minimum

circular dichroism (CD) and the enhancement for the signal of chiral molecules.
Different mechanisms have been proposed for explaining the plasmonic CD,
however, a quantitative one like ab initio mechanism in chiral molecules is
still unavailable. In this work, a mechanism similar to the chiral molecules is
analyzed. The giant extrinsic circular dichroism of plasmonic splitting
rectangle ring is quantitatively investigated theoretically. The interplay of
electric and magnetic modes of the meta-structure is proposed to explain the
giant CD. The interplay is analyzed both in an analytical coupled
electric-magnetic dipoles model and finite element method model. The surface
charge distributions show that the circular current yielded in the splitting
rectangle ring makes it behave like a magneton at some resonant modes, which
interact with electric modes and results in a mixing of the two kinds of modes.
The strong interplay of the two kinds of modes is mainly responsible for the
giant CD.The analysis of the chiral near field of the structure shows potential
applications in chiral molecule sensing.

impact of trigonal warping on magnetotransport and scaling properties of a
ballistic bilayer graphene in the Corbino geometry. Although the conductivity
at the charge-neutrality point and zero magnetic field exhibits a one-parameter
scaling, the shot-noise characteristics, quantified by the Fano factor
$\mathcal{F}$ and the third charge-transfer cumulant $\mathcal{R}$, remain
pseudodiffusive. This shows that the pseudodiffusive transport regime in
bilayer graphene is not related to the universal value of the conductivity but
can be identified by higher charge-transfer cumulants. For Corbino disks with
larger radii ratios the conductivity is suppressed by the trigonal warping,
mainly because the symmetry reduction amplifies backscattering for normal modes
corresponding to angular-momentum eigenvalues $\pm{}2\hbar$. Weak magnetic
fields enhance the conductivity, reaching the maximal value near the crossover
field $B_L=\frac{4}{3}\sqrt{3}\,({\hbar}/{e})\,t't_\perp\!\left[{t_0^2a(R_{\rm
o}-R_{\rm i})}\right]^{-1}$, where $t_0$ ($t_\perp$) is the nearest-neighbor
intra- (inter-)layer hopping integral, $t'$ is the skew-interlayer hopping
integral, and $R_{\rm o}$ ($R_{\rm i}$) is the outer (inner) disk radius. For
magnetic fields $B\gtrsim{}B_L$ we observe quasiperiodic conductance
oscillations characterized by the decreasing mean value
$\langle\sigma\rangle-\sigma_0\propto{}B_L/B$, where $\sigma_0=(8/\pi)\,e^2/h$.
The conductivity, as well as higher charge-transfer cumulants, show beating
patterns with an envelope period proportional to $\sqrt{B/B_L}$. This
constitutes a qualitative difference between the high-field ($B\gg{}B_L$)
magnetotransport in the $t'=0$ case (earlier discussed in Ref. [1]) and in the
$t'\neq{}0$ case, providing a finite-system analog of the Lifshitz transition.

expansion is still pending. What is making the situation even worst, it is
impossible to distinguish the vast majority of the proposed models of the
dynamical dark energy and modified gravity from the $\Lambda CDM$ in view of
recent geometrical and dynamical, observational data. On the other hand on
scales much smaller than the present Hubble scale, there are differences in the
growth of the matter perturbations for different modes of the perturbations in
the $\Lambda CDM$. In the view of the new planned observations that will give
insight into the perturbations of the dark sector this issue is being worth of
further investigation. We analyze the evolution of the dark matter
perturbations in the dynamical dark energy models with the singularities, such
as the sudden future singularity and the finite scale factor singularity. We
employ the Newtonian gauge formulation for derivation of the perturbation
equations for the growth function. We abandon the sub-Hubble approximation,
what leads to the scale dependent solutions for the perturbations. Treating the
growth function as a scale dependent allows to differentiate the dynamical dark
energy models with the singularities and the dynamical dark energy models and
the $\Lambda CDM$. The new data constraining growth of the perturbations will
be able to rule out the whole range of the values of the parameters allowed by
the present data of the dynamical dark energy models with the sudden future
singularity and the finite scale factor singularity.

In order to reduce the effect of this cancellation, we adopt the multiple
precision calculation for our discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) program,

From the obtained Zc(n,T), we calculate Lee--Yang zero distribution varying the

selected in the lepton+jets channel, requiring exactly one charged lepton and
at least four jets with at least two of the jets tagged as originating from a
$b$-quark. The measured spectra are corrected for detector effects and are
compared to several Monte Carlo simulations. The results are in fair agreement
with the predictions over a wide kinematic range. Nevertheless, most generators
predict a harder top-quark transverse momentum distribution at high values than
what is observed in the data. Predictions beyond NLO accuracy improve the
agreement with data at high top-quark transverse momenta. Using the current
settings and parton distribution functions, the rapidity distributions are not
well modelled by any generator under consideration. However, the level of

to power series having for coefficients the Riemann zeta function evaluated at
certain arithmetic sequences. A further generalization using arbitrary
Dirichlet series is also proposed. The resulting formulas are new, as far as we
know, since they could not be found in any of the classical or recent handbooks
of formulas that were at our disposal.

  with rough coefficients",,,,,"math.AP math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider existence and uniqueness issues for the initial value problem of
parabolic equations $\partial_{t} u = {\rm div} A \nabla u$ on the upper half
space, with initial data in $L^p$ spaces. The coefficient matrix $A$ is assumed
to be uniformly elliptic, but merely bounded measurable in space and time. For
real coefficients and a single equation, this is an old topic for which a
comprehensive theory is available, culminating in the work of Aronson. Much
less is understood for complex coefficients or systems of equations except for
the work of Lions, mainly because of the failure of maximum principles. In this
paper, we come back to this topic with new methods that do not rely on maximum
principles. This allows us to treat systems in this generality when $p\geq 2$,
or under certain assumptions such as bounded variation in the time variable (a
much weaker assumption that the usual H\""older continuity assumption) when $p<
2$. We reobtain results for real coefficients, and also complement them. For
instance, we obtain uniqueness for arbitrary $L^p$ data, $1\leq p \leq \infty$,
in the class $L^\infty(0,T; L^p({\mathbb{R}}^n))$. Our approach to the
existence problem relies on a careful construction of propagators for an
appropriate energy space, encompassing previous constructions. Our approach to
the uniqueness problem, the most novel aspect here, relies on a parabolic
version of the Kenig-Pipher maximal function, used in the context of elliptic
equations on non-smooth domains. We also prove comparison estimates involving
conical square functions of Lusin type and prove some Fatou type results about
non-tangential convergence of solutions. Recent results on maximal regularity
operators in tent spaces that do not require pointwise heat kernel bounds are
key tools in this study.

energy transfer between different modes. The perturbation interpreted as an
interaction between the modes is inferred as mode coupling. Mode coupling
process in an inhomogeneous medium such as solar spicules may lead to the
coupling of kink waves to local Alfven waves. This coupling occurs practically
in any conditions when there is smooth variation in density in the radial
direction. This process is seen as the decay of transverse kink waves in the
medium. To study the damping of kink waves due to mode coupling, a
2.5-dimensional numerical simulation of the initial wave is considered in
spicules. The initial perturbation is assumed to be in a plane perpendicular to
the spicule axis. The considered kink wave is a standing wave which shows an
exponential damping in the inhomogeneous layer after occurrence of the mode
coupling.

materials and structural components can be adversely affected due to external
stimuli, which include exposure to a corrosive chemical species, high
temperatures, temperature fluctuations (i.e., freezing-thawing), cyclic
mechanical loading, just to name a few. It is, therefore, of paramount
importance in several branches of engineering -- ranging from aerospace
engineering, civil engineering to biomedical engineering -- to have a
fundamental understanding of degradation of materials, as the materials in
these applications are often subjected to adverse environments. As a result of
recent advancements in material science, new materials like fiber-reinforced
polymers and multi-functional materials that exhibit high ductility have been
developed and widely used; for example, as infrastructural materials or in
medical devices (e.g., stents). The traditional small-strain approaches of
modeling these materials will not be adequate. In this paper, we study
degradation of materials due to an exposure to chemical species and temperature
under large-strain and large-deformations. In the first part of our research
work, we present a consistent mathematical model with firm thermodynamic
underpinning. We then obtain semi-analytical solutions of several canonical
problems to illustrate the nature of the quasi-static and unsteady behaviors of
degrading hyperelastic solids.
