field in connectomics. Entering dynamic functional connectivity by applying
sliding window techniques on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) time courses emerged
from this topic. We introduce frequency-resolved dynamic functional
connectivity (frdFC) by means of multivariate empirical mode decomposition
(MEMD) followed up by filter-bank investigations. We develop our method on the
most canonical form by applying a sliding window approach to the intrinsic mode
functions (IMFs) resulting from MEMD. We explore two modifications:
uniform-amplitude frequency scales by normalizing the IMFs by their
instantaneous amplitude and cumulative scales. By exploiting the well
established concept of scale-invariance in resting-state parameters, we compare
our frdFC approaches. In general, we find that MEMD is capable of generating
time courses to perform frdFC and we discover that the structure of
connectivity-states is robust over frequency scales and even becomes more
evident with decreasing frequency. This scale-stability varies with the number
of extracted clusters when applying k-means. We find a scale-stability drop-off
from k = 4 to k = 5 extracted connectivity-states, which is corroborated by
null-models, simulations, theoretical considerations, filter-banks, and
scale-adjusted windows. Our filter-bank studies show that filter design is more
delicate in the rs-fMRI than in the simulated case. Besides offering a baseline
for further frdFC research, we suggest and demonstrate the use of
scale-stability as a quality criterion for connectivity-state and model
selection. We present first evidence showing that scale-invariance plays an
important role in connectivity-state considerations. A data repository of our

a location of the Fermi level within the band gap region. More detailed

sites of these elements as well as to probe the evolution of the Galactic thin

Zr, La, Ce, Nd, Sm and Eu. We find that Nd, Sm, and Eu show trends similar to
what is observed for the alpha-elements when compared to [Fe/H]. [Sr/Fe] and
[Zr/Fe] show decreasing abundance ratios for increasing metallicity, reaching
sub-solar values at super-solar metallicities. [La/Fe] and [Ce/Fe] do not show
any clear trend with metallicity. The rapid neutron-capture process is active
early in the Galaxy, mainly in type II supernovae from stars in the mass range
8-10 M_sun. Eu is almost completely produced by r-process but Nd and Sm show
similar trends to Eu even if their s-process component is higher. Sr and Zr
show significant enrichment at low metallicity that requires extra r-process
production, that probably is different from the classical r-process. Finally,
La and Ce are mainly produced via s-process from AGB stars in mass range 2-4
M_sun. The trend of [X/Fe] with age found could be explained by considering
that the decrease in [X/Fe] for the thick disk stars can be due to the decrease
of type II supernovae with time meaning a reduced enrichment of r-process
elements in the interstellar medium. In the thin disk the trends are flatter
that probably is due to that the main production from s-process is balanced by
Fe production from type Ia supernovae.

constraints on the ATLAS online trigger reconstruction and selection system. To
cope with such increased constraints, the ATLAS High-Level Trigger, placed
after a first hardware-based Level 1 trigger, has been redesigned by merging
two previously separated software-based processing levels. In the new joint
processing level, the algorithms run in the same computing nodes, thus sharing
resources, minimizing the data transfer from the detector buffers and
increasing the algorithm flexibility.
  The jet trigger software selects events containing high transverse momentum
hadronic jets. It needs optimal jet energy resolution to help rejecting an
overwhelming background while retaining good efficiency for interesting jets.
In particular, this requires the CPU-intensive reconstruction of tridimensional
energy deposits in the ATLAS calorimeter to be used as the basic input to the
jet finding algorithms. To allow this costly reconstruction step, a partial
detector readout scheme was developed, that effectively suppresses the low
activity regions of the calorimeter and significantly reduces the needed
resources. In this paper we describe the overall jet trigger software and its
physics performance. We then focus on detailed studies of the algorithm timing

distinguishability of the sequence of interactions used by the tester and (ii)
maximum robustness is attained when the interactions are perfectly

scalar couplings from the requirement that the global minimum is not charge
breaking. We find that in highly fine-tuned regions of parameter space, the
ratio BR(h->tau mu)/BR(h->tau tau) can be enhanced by about three orders of
magnitude above the estimate from naive dimensional analysis, but still about
two orders of magnitude below the present bound. Thus, if h->tau mu is
experimentally established to be close to present bounds, the MSSM will be
excluded.

be improved either by increasing the perturbation order or by enlarging the

showing promising results. In this paper, we report an extension of SEET to
quantum chemical ab initio Hamiltonians for applications to molecular systems.
The self-consistent second-order Green's function (GF2) method is used to
describe the non-local correlations, while the full configuration interaction
(FCI) method is carried out to capture strong correlation within the active
space. Using few proof-of-concept examples, we show that SEET yields results of
comparable quality to $n-$electron valence state second-order perturbation
theory (NEVPT2) with the same active space, and furthermore, the full active
space can be split into smaller active spaces without further implementation.
Moreover, SEET avoids intruder states and does not require any high-order
reduced density matrices. These advantages show that SEET is a promising method

processes of Higgs production and decay that have been measured so far, six

procedures leads to asymptotically unbiased estimators of simple parameters

between variables. As a result, it generally leads to biased estimators of
bivariate parameters such as coefficients of correlation or odd-ratios.
Household and social surveys typically collect categorical variables, for which
missing values are usually handled by nearest-neighbour imputation or random
hot-deck imputation. In this paper, we propose a simple random imputation

the alteration in abundances that is produced by the accretion of material lost

two cases the companion is a white dwarf, and in the other two cases the

where it exits San Jos\'e (Southwest). We identified the urban parks with a
minimum area of approximately 5 000m2 and randomly selected a sample of 40
parks located along the passage of wind through the city. To measure lichen
coverage, we applied a previously validated 10 x 20cm template with 50 random

masses. The practical implication is that the air enters the city relatively
clean by the semi-rural and economically middle class area of Coronado, and
leaves through the developed neighborhoods of Escaz\'u and Santa Ana with a
significant amount of pollutants. In the dry season, the live lichen coverage

that chemical patterns of solar twins are characterised by the correlation
between the differential abundances relative to the Sun and the condensation
temperatures (Tc) of the elements. It has been suggested that the origin of
this relation is related to the chemical evolution of the Galactic disk, but
other processes, associated with the presence of planets around stars, might
also be involved.
  Aims: We analyse HIRES spectra of 14 solar twins and the Sun to provide new
insights on the mechanisms that can determine the relation between [X/H] and
Tc.
  Methods: Our spectroscopic analysis produced stellar parameters (Teff, log g,
[Fe/H], and $\xi$), ages, masses, and abundances of 22 elements (C, O, Na, Mg,
Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, and Ba). We
used these determinations to place new constraints on the chemical evolution of
the Galactic disk and to verify whether this process alone can explain the
different [X/H]-Tc slopes observed so far.
  Results: We confirm that the [X/Fe] ratios of all the species correlate with
age. The slopes of these relations allow us to describe the effect that the
chemical evolution of the Galactic disk has on the chemical patterns of the
solar twins. After subtracting the chemical evolution effect, we find that the
unevolved [X/H]-Tc slope values do not depend on the stellar ages anymore.
However, the wide diversity among these [X/H]-Tc slopes, covering a range of
$\pm$4~10$^{-5}$ dex K$^{-1}$, indicates that processes in addition to the
chemical evolution may affect the [X/H]-Tc slopes.
  Conclusions: The wide range of unevolved [X/H]-Tc slope values spanned at all
ages by our sample could reflect the wide diversity among exo-planetary systems
observed so far and the variety of fates that the matter in circumstellar disks
can experience.

conditions for a wave solver, including outflow boundary conditions, in 1D and
2D. The scheme works in a logically Cartesian fashion, and the boundary points
are embedded into the regular mesh, without incurring stability restrictions,
so that boundary conditions are imposed without any reduction in the order of

of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Further, we develop outflow and
periodic boundary conditions for the MOL$^T$ formulation. Our solver is
designed to couple with particle codes, and so special attention is also paid
to the implementation of point sources, and soft sources which can be used to
launch waves into waveguides.

estimates of LASSO and AMP, little is known about their behavior as a function
of the regularization parameter $\lambda$, or the thereshold parameters
$\tau^t$. For instance the following basic questions have not yet been studied
in the literature: (i) How does the size of the active set
$\|\hat{\beta}^\lambda\|_0/p$ behave as a function of $\lambda$? (ii) How does
the mean square error $\|\hat{\beta}_{\lambda} - \beta_o\|_2^2/p$ behave as a

However, a clear signal of a WIMP has not been found yet and it makes us to
suspect that WIMPs are questionable as a dark matter candidate. Taking into
account this situation, we propose two models in which dark matter relic
density is produced by decay of a metastable particle. In the first model, the
metastable particle is a feebly interacting massive particle, which is the
so-called FIMP produced by freeze-in mechanism in the early universe. In the
second model, the decaying particle is thermally produced the same as the usual
WIMP. However decay of the particle into dark matter is led by a higher
dimensional operator. As a phenomenologically interesting feature of nonthermal
dark matter discussed in this paper, a strong sharp gamma-ray emission as an
indirect detection signal occurs due to internal bremsstrahlung, although some
parameter space has already been ruled out by this process. Moreover combining
other experimental and theoretical constraints such as dark matter relic
density, big bang nucleosynthesis, collider, gamma-rays and perturbativity of
couplings, we discuss the two nonthermal DM models.

that galaxies in X-ray strong groups and clusters have preferentially low

stellar masses. The trends that we observe do not change when considering only
galaxies found within or outside of the X-ray radius of the host group. When
considering central and satellite galaxies separately we find that this
dependence on X-ray luminosity is only present for satellites, and we show that
our results are consistent with ""galaxy stangulation"" as a mechanism for
quenching these satellites. We investigate the dynamics of the groups and
clusters in the sample, and find that the velocity distributions of galaxies
beyond the virial radius in low X-ray luminosity halos tend to be less Gaussian

luminosity groups and clusters having enhanced populations of star-forming and

in the framework of linearized gravity. Although the effects are very small,
they may be of fundamental physical interest. It is shown that the
gravitational field of a linearly polarized light pulse is modulated as the
norm of the corresponding electric field strength, while no modulations arise
for circular polarization. In general, the gravitational field is independent
of the polarization direction. It is shown that all physical effects are
confined to spherical shells expanding with the speed of light, and that these
shells are associated with the emission and absorption of the pulse. Nearby
test particles at rest are attracted towards the pulse trajectory by the
gravitational field due to the emission of the pulse, and they are repelled
from the pulse trajectory by the gravitational field due to its absorption.
Examples are given for the size of the attractive effect. It is recovered that
massless test particles do not experience any physical effect if they are
co-propagating with the pulse, and that the acceleration of massless test
particles counter-propagating with respect to the pulse is four times stronger
than for massive particles at rest. The similarities between the gravitational
effect of a laser pulse and Newtonian gravity in two dimensions are pointed

normalization, reLU, max-pooling, and sub-sampling pipeline, possess more
complex forms of symmetry arising from scaling-based reparameterization of the
network weights. We propose to tackle the issue of the weight space symmetry by
constraining the filters to lie on the unit-norm manifold. Consequently,
training the network boils down to using stochastic gradient descent updates on
the unit-norm manifold. Our empirical evidence based on the MNIST dataset shows
that the proposed updates improve the test performance beyond what is achieved
with batch normalization and without sacrificing the computational efficiency

of reading is significantly cheaper than the cost of writing. Such asymmetry in
memory costs poses a fundamentally different model from the RAM for algorithm
design. In this paper we study lower and upper bounds for various problems
under such asymmetric read and write costs. We consider both the case in which
all but $O(1)$ memory has asymmetric cost, and the case of a small cache of
symmetric memory. We model both cases using the $(M,\omega)$-ARAM, in which
there is a small (symmetric) memory of size $M$ and a large unbounded
(asymmetric) memory, both random access, and where reading from the large
memory has unit cost, but writing has cost $\omega\gg 1$.
  For FFT and sorting networks we show a lower bound cost of $\Omega(\omega
n\log_{\omega M} n)$, which indicates that it is not possible to achieve
asymptotic improvements with cheaper reads when $\omega$ is bounded by a
polynomial in $M$. Also, there is an asymptotic gap (of $\min(\omega,\log
n)/\log(\omega M)$) between the cost of sorting networks and comparison sorting
in the model. This contrasts with the RAM, and most other models. We also show
a lower bound for computations on an $n\times n$ diamond DAG of $\Omega(\omega
n^2/M)$ cost, which indicates no asymptotic improvement is achievable with fast
reads. However, we show that for the edit distance problem (and related
problems), which would seem to be a diamond DAG, there exists an algorithm with
only $O(\omega n^2/(M\min(\omega^{1/3},M^{1/2})))$ cost. To achieve this we
make use of a ""path sketch"" technique that is forbidden in a strict DAG
computation. Finally, we show several interesting upper bounds for shortest
path problems, minimum spanning trees, and other problems. A common theme in
many of the upper bounds is to have redundant computation to tradeoff between
reads and writes.

to calculate photo-heating in an efficient and accurate way. In C$^2$-Ray, the
thermal calculation demands relatively small time-steps for accurate results.
We describe two novel methods to reduce the computational cost associated with
small time-steps, namely, an adaptive time-step algorithm and an asynchronous
evolution approach. The adaptive time-step algorithm determines an optimal
time-step for the next computational step. It uses a fast ray-tracing scheme to
quickly locate the relevant cells for this determination and only use these
cells for the calculation of the time-step. Asynchronous evolution allows
different cells to evolve with different time-steps. The asynchronized clocks
of the cells are synchronized at the times where outputs are produced. By only
evolving cells which may require short time-steps with these short time-steps
instead of imposing them to the whole grid, the computational cost of the
calculation can be substantially reduced. We show that our methods work well
for several cosmologically relevant test problems and validate our results by
comparing to the results of another time-dependent photo-ionization code.

Particle Image Velocimetry and 2D Particle Tracking were used to measure the
instantaneous velocities of the flow and the particles' trajectories
simultaneously. We find that for particles examined in this study (Rep = 0.4 -
123), settling velocity is either enhanced or unchanged relative to stagnant
flow for the range of investigated turbulence conditions. The smallest
particles scaled best with a Kolmogorov-based Stokes number indicating the
dissipative scales influence their dynamics. In contrast, the mid-sized
particles scaled better with a Stokes number based on the integral time scale.
The largest particles were largely unaffected by the flow conditions. Using
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), the flow pattern scales are compared to
particle trajectory curvature to complement results obtained through
dimensional analysis using Stokes numbers. The smallest particles are found to
have trajectories with curvatures of similar scale as the small flow scales
(higher POD modes) whilst mid-sized particle trajectories had curvatures that
were similar to the larger flow patterns (lower POD modes). The curvature
trajectories of the largest particles did not correspond to any particular flow
pattern scale suggesting that their trajectories were more random. These
results provide experimental evidence of the 'fast tracking' theory of settling
velocity enhancement in turbulence and demonstrate that particles align
themselves with flow scales in proportion to their size.

generalizing recent results by Shanmugam and Dimakis and by Mazumdar on the
complementarity between the optimal broadcast rate of an index coding problem
on a directed graph and the normalized rate of a locally recoverable
distributed storage problem on the same graph, it is shown that the capacity
region and the optimal rate region of these two problems are complementary. The
main ingredients in establishing this result are the notion of confusion graph
introduced by Alon et al. (2008), the vertex transitivity of a confusion graph,
the characterization of the index coding capacity region via the fractional
chromatic number of confusion graphs, and the characterization of the optimal
rate region of the locally recoverable distributed storage via the independence
number of confusion graphs. As the third and final facet of the
complementarity, guessing games on graphs by Riis are discussed as special
cases of the locally recoverable distributed storage problem, and it is shown
that the winning probability of the optimal strategy for a guessing game and
the ratio between the winning probabilities of the optimal strategy and a
random guess can be characterized, respectively, by the capacity region for

as an ad-hoc procedure involving the ugly collapse of the wave function. No
wonder we search for more satisfying alternatives to the Copenhagen

with modern measurement theory with its notions of the conditioned state and
quantum trajectory. In addition, what we know of as the Copenhagen
interpretation is a later 1950's development and some of the earlier pioneers
like Bohr did not talk of wave function collapse. In fact, if one takes these
earlier ideas and mixes them with later insights of decoherence, a much more
satisfying version of Copenhagen quantum mechanics emerges, one for which the
collapse of the wave function is seen to be a harmless book keeping device.
Along the way, we explain why chaotic systems lead to wave functions that
spread out quickly on macroscopic scales implying that Schrodinger cat states
are the norm rather than curiosities generated in physicists' laboratories. We
then describe how the conditioned state of a quantum system depends crucially
on how the system is monitored illustrating this with the example of a decaying
atom monitored with a time of arrival photon detector, leading to Bohr's
quantum jumps. On the other hand, other kinds of detection lead to much
smoother behaviour, providing yet another example of complementarity. Finally
we explain how classical behaviour emerges, including classical mechanics but

and grids of stellar models, we compute analytically an equivalent modified

frequency-averaged dissipation due to the viscous friction applied by turbulent
convection on tidal waves. It leads the conversion of their kinetic energy into
heat and tidal evolution of orbits and spin. During their Pre-Main-Sequence,
all low-mass stars have a decrease of the equivalent modified tidal quality
factor for a fixed angular velocity of their convective envelope. Next, it
evolves on the Main Sequence to an asymptotic value that is minimum for

the inner regions of the accretion flow and the corona that produces the
intense X-ray continuum. Techniques by which the geometry and extent of the
corona can be measured through the observed X-ray spectrum are reviewed along
with the evolution in the structure of the corona that is seen to accompany
variations in the X-ray luminosity both on long and short timescales. Detailed
analyses of the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies Markarian 335 and 1H0707-495,
over observations with XMM-Newton as well as Suzaku and NuSTAR spanning nearly
a decade reveal that increases in the X-ray luminosity coincide with an
expansion of the corona to cover a larger area of the inner accretion disc.
Underlying this long timescale variability lie more complex patterns of
behaviour on short timescales. Flares in the X-ray emission during a low flux
state of Mrk 335 observed in 2013 and 2014 are found to mark a reconfiguration
of the corona while there is evidence that the flares were caused by a vertical
collimation and ejection of coronal material, reminiscent of an aborted
jet-launching event. Measurements of the corona and reflecting accretion disc
are combined to infer the conditions on the inner disc that lead to the flaring

accreting significantly below the Eddington limit at z~2, in contrast to what
is generally found for luminous AGNs at high redshift. Our analysis of
observational selection biases indicates that the ""AGN cosmic downsizing""

number density at the bright end of the AGN luminosity function, together with
the corresponding selection effects. However, it might need to consider a
correlation between the AGN luminosity and the accretion rate of black holes
that luminous AGNs have higher Eddington ratios than low-luminosity AGNs in
order to understand the relatively small fraction of low-luminosity AGNs with

capture binary neutron star mergers, emphasizing the role played by the neutron
star spin. Dynamical capture mergers may take place in globular clusters, as
well as other dense stellar systems, where most neutron stars have large spins.
We find significant variability in the merger outcome as a function of initial
neutron star spin. For cases where the spin is aligned with the orbital angular
momentum, the additional centrifugal support in the remnant hypermassive
neutron star can prevent the prompt collapse to a black hole, while for
antialigned cases the decreased total angular momentum can facilitate the
collapse to a black hole. We show that even moderate spins can significantly
increase the amount of ejected material, including the amount unbound with
velocities greater than half the speed of light, leading to brighter
electromagnetic signatures associated with kilonovae and interaction of the
ejecta with the interstellar medium. Furthermore, we find that the initial
neutron star spin can strongly affect the already rich phenomenology in the
postmerger gravitational wave signatures that arise from the oscillation modes
of the hypermassive neutron star. In several of our simulations, the resulting
hypermassive neutron star develops the one-arm ($m=1$) spiral instability, the
most pronounced cases being those with small but non-negligible neutron star
spins. For long-lived hypermassive neutron stars, the presence of this
instability leads to improved prospects for detecting these events through

the haloes are never more elliptical than $e_{dm} = 0.2$, their stars can

N-body simulations of the ""Lambda Cold Dark Matter"" ({\Lambda}CDM) model: there
are far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in cold dark matter halos

massive substructures (the ""too-big-to-fail"" problem); and the brightest
satellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the ""planes of

halos and the evolution in the LG environment, the simulations reproduce the
observed relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individual
dwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in their
dark matter profiles. Satellite systems form with a range of spatial
anisotropies, including one similar to that of the MW, confirming that such a
configuration is not unexpected in {\Lambda}CDM. Finally, based on the observed
velocity dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide new estimates of the

probably vary in their velocity and/or in the rate of mass loss. Such
`episodic' ejection events have been observed during the Class 0 protostellar
phase (the early accretion stage), and continue during the subsequent class I
phase that marks the first one million years of star formation. Previously
observed episodic-ejection sources were relatively isolated; however, the most
common sites of star formation are clusters. Outflows link protostars with
their environment and provide a viable source of turbulence that is necessary
for regulating star formation in clusters, but it is not known how an
accretion-driven jet or outflow in a clustered environment manifests itself in
its earliest stage. This early stage is important in establishing the initial
conditions for momentum and energy transfer to the environment as the protostar
and cluster evolve. Here we report that an outflow from a very young class 0
protostar, at the hub of the very active and filamentary Serpens South
protostellar cluster, shows unambiguous episodic events. The $^{12}$CO (J=2-1)
emission from the protostar reveals 22 distinct features of outflow ejecta, the
most recent having the highest velocity. The outflow forms bipolar lobes ---
one of the first detectable signs of star formation --- which originate from
the peak of 1-mm continuum emission. Emission from the surrounding C$^{18}$O
envelope shows kinematics consistent with rotation and an infall of material
onto the protostar. The data suggest that episodic accretion-driven outflow
begins in the earliest phase of protostellar evolution, and that the outflow
remains intact in a very clustered environment, probably providing efficient

their absolute brightnesses. This analysis is completed in a blinded fashion,
ensuring that decisions made in implementing the method do not inadvertently

norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$ invariant under sign-flips and coordinate-permutations),

of $l$. Specifically, we provide nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the
space complexity of calculating a $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation to the norm of
the stream, for every $0<\epsilon\leq 1/2$. (The bounds match up to
$poly(\epsilon^{-1} \log n)$ factors.) We further extend those bounds to any
large approximation ratio $D\geq 1.1$, showing that the decrease in space
complexity is proportional to $D^2$, and that this factor the best possible.
All of the bounds depend on the median of $l(x)$ when $x$ is drawn uniformly
from the $l_2$ unit sphere. The same median governs many phenomena in
high-dimensional spaces, such as large-deviation bounds and the critical
dimension in Dvoretzky's Theorem.
  The family of symmetric norms contains several well-studied norms, such as
all $l_p$~norms, and indeed we provide a new explanation for the disparity in
space complexity between $p\le 2$ and $p>2$. In addition, we apply our general
results to easily derive bounds for several norms that were not studied before
in the streaming model, including the top-$k$ norm and the $k$-support norm,
which was recently employed for machine learning tasks.
  Overall, these results make progress on two outstanding problems in the area

dramatically alter the chemistry of the gas, opening the path to complex
molecules. Metals might enhance the ability of the gas to radiate away its
thermal energy, thus favoring the formation of gravitationally bound objects;
they can also condensate in a solid phase (dust grains), partly or totally
blocking radiation from luminous sources. Finally, they represent useful
tracers of energy deposition by stars and probe the physical properties of the

light of high-dimensional data analysis. We consider a new and simple screening
method that incorporates multiple predictors in each step of forward
regression, with decision on which variables to incorporate based on the same
criterion. If only one step is carried out, it actually reduces to the SIS.
Thus it can be regarded as a generalization and unification of the FR and the
SIS. More importantly, it preserves the sure screening property and has similar
computational complexity as FR in each step, yet it can discover the relevant
covariates in fewer steps. Thus, it reduces the computational burden of FR
drastically while retaining advantages of the latter over SIS. Furthermore, we
show that it can find all the true variables if the number of steps taken is

synthesis of new material combinations, combining superconductivity, low

that the interface between a one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor (Sm) with
strong SOC and a superconductor (S) hosts Majorana modes with nontrivial
topological properties [5-8]. Recently, epitaxial growth of Al on InAs
nanowires was shown to yield a high quality S-Sm system with uniformly
transparent interfaces [9] and a hard induced gap, indicted by strongly
suppressed sub gap tunneling conductance [10]. Here we report the realization
of a two-dimensional (2D) InAs/InGaAs heterostructure with epitaxial Al,
yielding a planar S-Sm system with structural and transport characteristics as
good as the epitaxial wires. The realization of 2D epitaxial S-Sm systems
represent a significant advance over wires, allowing extended networks via
top-down processing. Among numerous potential applications, this new material
system can serve as a platform for complex networks of topological
superconductors with gate-controlled Majorana zero modes [1-4]. We demonstrate
gateable Josephson junctions and a highly transparent 2D S-Sm interface based
on the product of excess current and normal state resistance.

rules on an observer's information acquisition. Our approach is purely
operational: we consider an observer O interrogating a system S with binary
questions and define S's state as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S. From
the rules we derive the state spaces for N elementary systems and show that (a)
they coincide with the set of density matrices over an N-qubit Hilbert space;
(b) states evolve unitarily under the group $\rm{PSU}(2^N)$ according to the
von Neumann evolution equation; and (c) O's binary questions correspond to
projective Pauli operator measurements with outcome probabilities given by the
Born rule. As a by-product, this results in a propositional formulation of
quantum theory. Aside from offering an informational explanation for the
theory's architecture, the reconstruction also unravels new structural
insights. We show that, in a derived quadratic information measure, (d) qubits
satisfy inequalities which bound the information content in any set of mutually
complementary questions to 1 bit; and (e) maximal sets of mutually
complementary questions for one and two qubits must carry precisely 1 bit of
information in pure states. The latter relations constitute conserved
informational charges which define the unitary groups and, together with their
conservation conditions, the sets of pure quantum states. These results
highlight information as a `charge of quantum theory' and the benefits of this
informational approach. This work emphasizes the sufficiency of restricting to
an observer's information to reconstruct the theory and completes the quantum

increasingly important, as they model practical settings more accurately. The
social welfare function, which is the standard measure of efficiency in
auctions, is inadequate for settings with budgets, since there may be a large
disconnect between the value a bidder derives from obtaining an item and what
can be liquidated from her. The Liquid Welfare objective function has been
suggested as a natural alternative for settings with budgets. Simple auctions,
like simultaneous item auctions, are evaluated by their performance at
equilibrium using the Price of Anarchy (PoA) measure -- the ratio of the
objective function value of the optimal outcome to the worst equilibrium.
Accordingly, we evaluate the performance of simultaneous item auctions in
budgeted settings by the Liquid Price of Anarchy (LPoA) measure -- the ratio of
the optimal Liquid Welfare to the Liquid Welfare obtained in the worst
equilibrium.
  Our main result is that the LPoA for mixed Nash equilibria is bounded by a
constant when bidders are additive and items can be divided into sufficiently
many discrete parts. Our proofs are robust, and can be extended to achieve
similar bounds for simultaneous second price auctions as well as Bayesian Nash
equilibria. For pure Nash equilibria, we establish tight bounds on the LPoA for
the larger class of fractionally-subadditive valuations. To derive our results,
we develop a new technique in which some bidders deviate (surprisingly) toward
a non-optimal solution. In particular, this technique does not fit into the
smoothness framework.

faint end, and an evolution in the production efficiency of Lyman-continuum
photons with cosmic time. Despite these uncertainties, plausible choices for
these parameters naturally predict a cosmic ionizing emissivity at z~6-10 whose

eigenstates of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) operator. The paraxial
solutions predict that beams with large OAM could be used to resolve
arbitrarily small distances - a dubious situation. Here we show how to solve
that situation by calculating the properties of beams free from the paraxial
approximation. We find the surprising result that indeed one can resolve
smaller distances with larger OAM, although with decreased visibility. If the
visibility is kept constant (for instance at the Rayleigh criterion, the limit
where two points are reasonably distinguishable), larger OAM does not provide
an advantage. The drop in visibility is due to a field in the direction of
propagation, which is neglected within the paraxial limit.

and constrain its high-mass end with unprecedented precision. We find that the
galaxy SMF in the densest regions has a different shape than that measured at
low densities, with an enhancement of massive galaxies and a hint of a flatter
(less negative) slope at $z<0.8$. We normalise each SMF to the comoving volume
occupied by the corresponding environment, and relate estimates from different
redshift bins. We observe an evolution of the SMF of VIPERS galaxies in high
densities, while the low-density one is nearly constant. We compare these
results to semi-analytical models and find consistent environmental signatures.
We discuss how the halo mass function and fraction of central/satellite
galaxies depend on the environments considered, making intrinsic and
environmental properties of galaxies physically coupled, and therefore
difficult to disentangle. The evolution of our low-density regions is well
described by the formalism introduced by Peng et al.~(2010), and is consistent
with the idea that galaxies become progressively passive because of internal
physical processes. The same formalism could also describe the evolution of the
SMF in the high density regions, but only if a significant contribution from
dry mergers is considered. [Abridged]

should be reformulated as a mapping between past and future representations of
an algebra of densities on the conformal boundary. These densities are best
thought of as living on the momentum space light cone dual to null infinity,
which describes the simultaneous eigenstates of the BMS generators. The
currents describe the flow of other quantum numbers through the holographic
screen at infinity. They are operator valued measures on the momentum light
cone, with non-zero support at $P = 0$, which is necessary to describe finite
flows of total momentum, with zero energy-momentum density, on the asymptotic
holographic screen. Jet states, the closest approximation to the conventional
notion of asymptotic particle state, have finite momentum flowing out through
spherical caps of finite opening angle, with the zero momentum currents
vanishing in annuli surrounding these caps. Although these notions are valid
both in field theory and quantum gravity, I'll argue that they form the basis
for understanding the holographic/covariant entropy principle in the latter
framework, where the densities form a complete set of operators. The variables
on a finite area holographic screen are restrictions of those at infinity. The
restriction is implemented by a cutoff on the Euclidean Dirac spectrum on the
screen, which is a generalized UV/IR correspondence.

anatomy reconstruction of biological specimen. During the last decade, high
resolution electron microscopy (EM) of serial sections has become the de-facto
standard for reconstruction of neural connectivity at ever increasing scales
(EM connectomics). In serial section microscopy, the axial dimension of the
volume is sampled by physically removing thin sections from the embedded
specimen and subsequently imaging either the block-face or the section series.
This process has limited precision leading to inhomogeneous non-planar sampling
of the axial dimension of the volume which, in turn, results in distorted image
volumes. This includes that section series may be collected and imaged in
unknown order.
  Results: We developed methods to identify and correct these distortions
through image-based signal analysis without any additional physical apparatus
or measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods in proof of
principle experiments and application to real world problems.

using a model that takes into account the effects of gravity, viscosity,
rotation, surface tension and wettability. Such a system can be considered as a
prototype for many other systems where the interplay of spatial heterogeneity
and a lateral driving force in the proximity of a first- or second-order phase
transition results in intricate behavior. So does a partially wetting drop on a
rotating cylinder undergo a depinning transition as the rotation speed is
increased, whereas for ideally wetting liquids the behavior \bfuwe{only changes

is increased for several values of the equilibrium contact angle of the
partially wetting liquids. This allows us to discuss how the entire bifurcation
structure and the flow behavior it encodes changes with changing wettability.

performance on several pattern recognition problems. However, the training of
RNNs is a computationally difficult task owing to the well-known
""vanishing/exploding"" gradient problem. Algorithms proposed for training RNNs
either exploit no (or limited) curvature information and have cheap
per-iteration complexity, or attempt to gain significant curvature information
at the cost of increased per-iteration cost. The former set includes
diagonally-scaled first-order methods such as ADAGRAD and ADAM, while the
latter consists of second-order algorithms like Hessian-Free Newton and K-FAC.
In this paper, we present adaQN, a stochastic quasi-Newton algorithm for
training RNNs. Our approach retains a low per-iteration cost while allowing for
non-diagonal scaling through a stochastic L-BFGS updating scheme. The method
uses a novel L-BFGS scaling initialization scheme and is judicious in storing
and retaining L-BFGS curvature pairs. We present numerical experiments on two
language modeling tasks and show that adaQN is competitive with popular RNN
training algorithms.

method is illustrated by solving the case of a planar $\theta$-boundary but can
also be applied for cylindrical and spherical geometries for which the

exploring the distance-decay parameter of the urban gravity model. Based on the
concepts from fractal geometry, several fractal parameter relations can be
derived from scaling laws of self-similar hierarchies of cities. Results show
that the distance exponent is just a scaling exponent, which equals the average
fractal dimension of the size measurements of the cities within a geographical
region. The scaling exponent can be evaluated with the product of Zipf's
exponent of size distributions and the fractal dimension of spatial
distributions of geographical elements such as cities and towns. The new
equations are applied to China's cities, and the empirical results accord with
the theoretical expectations. The findings lend further support to the
suggestion that the geographical gravity model is a fractal model, and its
distance exponent is associated with a fractal dimension and Zipf's exponent.
This work will help geographers understand the gravity model using fractal
theory and estimate the distance exponent using fractal modeling.

boundary dimension of a city is always numerically overestimated by the
traditional formula. An adjusting formula has been derived to revise the
overestimated boundary dimension and estimate the form dimension, but the
association between the global and local fractal parameters is not clear. This
paper is devoted to describing the urban evolution by using the improved
fractal parameters based on the area-perimeter measure relation. A system of 68
cities and towns in Yangtze River Delta, China, is taken as an example to make
a case study. A discovery is that the average values of the local fractal
parameters are approximately equal to the corresponding global fractal
parameters of cities. This suggests that the local parameters are the
decomposition of the global parameters. The novelty of this empirical study is
as follows: first, the form dimension and boundary dimension are integrated to
characterize the urban structure and texture; second, the global and local
parameters are combined to characterize an urban system and individual cities.
By illustrating how to carry out the area-perimeter scaling analysis in the
case of remote sensing images with low resolution, this work suggests a
possible new approach to researching fractal systems of cities.

the existence of multiple spiral arms in disks with a single planet, and
discover a scaling relation between the azimuthal separation of the primary and
secondary arm, $\phi_{\rm sep}$, and the planet-to-star mass ratio $q$:
$\phi_{\rm sep} = 102^{\circ} (q/0.001)^{0.2}$ for companions between Neptune
mass and 16 Jupiter masses around a 1 solar mass star, and $\phi_{\rm sep} =
180^{\circ}$ for brown dwarf mass companions. This relation is independent of
the disk's temperature, and can be used to infer a planet's mass to within an
accuracy of about 30% given only the morphology of a face-on disk. Combining
hydrodynamics and Monte-Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we verify that
our numerical measurements of $\phi_{\rm sep}$ are accurate representations of
what would be measured in near-infrared scattered light images, such as those
expected to be taken by Gemini/GPI, VLT/SPHERE, or Subaru/SCExAO in the future.
Finally, we are able to infer, using our scaling relation, that the planet
responsible for the spiral structure in SAO 206462 has a mass of about 6
Jupiter masses.

in dismantling of traditional culture, which then result in collective
depravity of a nationality. By quantitative analysis and mathematical modeling,
the causality between urbanization and ikization is discussed, and the theory
of replacement dynamics is employed to interpret the process of ikization.
Urbanization is in essence a nonlinear process of population replacement.
Urbanization may result in ikization because that the migration of population
from rural regions to urban regions always give rise to abrupt changes of
geographical environments and traditional culture. It is necessary to protect
the geographical environment against disruption, and to inherit and develop

K\Lambda, K\Sigma$ reaction data for $W\le 2.1$ GeV. We analyze
electron-induced reaction data for both proton and neutron targets to determine
the vector current form factors up to $Q^2\le$ 3.0 (GeV/$c$)$^2$. Axial-current
matrix elements are derived in accordance with the Partially Conserved Axial
Current (PCAC) relation to the $\pi N$ interactions of the DCC model. As a
result, we can uniquely determine the interference pattern between resonant and
non-resonant amplitudes. Our calculated cross sections for neutrino-induced
single-pion productions are compared with available data, and are found to be
in reasonable agreement with the data. We also calculate the double-pion
production cross sections in the resonance region, for the first time, with
relevant resonance contributions and channel couplings. The result is compared
with the double-pion production data. For a future development of a
neutrino-nucleus reaction model and/or a neutrino event generator for analyses
of neutrino experiments, the DCC model presented here can give a useful input.

largely unexplored time period in the history of our universe when the first
galaxies form, and to interpret these measurements. Early galaxies dramatically
impacted the gas around them in the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM) by
photoionzing the gas during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). This epoch likely
spanned an extended stretch in cosmic time: ionized regions formed and grew
around early generations of galaxies, gradually filling a larger and larger
fraction of the volume of the universe. At some time -- thus far uncertain, but
within the first billion years or so after the big bang -- essentially the
entire volume of the universe became filled with ionized gas. The properties of
the IGM provide valuable information regarding the formation time and nature of
early galaxy populations, and many approaches for studying the first luminous
sources are hence based on measurements of the surrounding intergalactic gas.
The prospects for improved reionization-era observations of the IGM and early
galaxy populations over the next decade are outstanding. Motivated by this, we
review the current state of models of the IGM during reionization. We focus on
a few key aspects of reionization-era phenomenology and describe: the redshift
evolution of the volume-averaged ionization fraction, the properties of the
sources and sinks of ionizing photons, along with models describing the spatial
variations in the ionization fraction, the ultraviolet radiation field, the
temperature of the IGM, and the gas density distribution.

systems such as urban traf- fic, social services institutions, economical and
ecosystems. Mathematically, the dynamical process of complex resource
allocation can be modeled as minority games in which the number of resources is
limited and agents tend to choose the less used resource based on available
information. Spontaneous evolution of the resource allocation dynamics,
however, often leads to a harmful herding behavior accompanied by strong
fluctuations in which a large majority of agents crowd temporarily for a few
resources, leaving many others unused. Developing effective control strategies
to suppress and elim- inate herding is an important but open problem. Here we
develop a pinning control method. That the fluctuations of the system consist
of intrinsic and systematic components allows us to design a control scheme
with separated control variables. A striking finding is the universal existence
of an optimal pinning fraction to minimize the variance of the system,
regardless of the pinning patterns and the network topology. We carry out a
detailed theoretical analysis to understand the emergence of optimal pinning
and to predict the dependence of the optimal pinning fraction on the network
topol- ogy. Our theory is generally applicable to systems with heterogeneous
resource capacities as well as varying control and network topological
parameters such as the average degree and the degree dis- tribution exponent.
Our work represents a general framework to deal with the broader problem of
controlling collective dynamics in complex systems with potential applications
in social, economical and political systems.

3-{\mu}m band shapes the asteroid population. Although a formal taxonomy is yet
to be fully established, the ""Pallas-type"" spectral group is most consistent
with the presence of phyllosilicates. If Ch class and Pallas type are both
indicative of phyllosilicates, then all Ch-class asteroids should also be
Pallas-type. In order to test this hypothesis, we obtained 42 observations of
36 Ch-class asteroids in the 2- to 4-{\mu}m spectral region. We found that 88%
of the spectra have 3-{\mu}m band shapes most consistent with the Pallas-type

been found. Because the Ch class is defined by the presence of an absorption
near 0.7 {\mu}m, this demonstrates that the 0.7-{\mu}m band serves not only as
a proxy for the presence of a band in the 3-{\mu}m region, but specifically for
the presence of Pallas-type bands. There is some evidence for a correlation
between band depth at 2.95 {\mu}m and absolute magnitude and/or albedo.
However, we find only weak correlations between 2.95-{\mu}m band depth and
semi-major axis. The connection between band depths in the 0.7- and 3-{\mu}m

efficient numerical simulations of the dynamics. With this model we studied the
contribution of radiation losses to the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth, as
measured with the stripline FMR. We found that for films with large
conductivity of metals the radiation losses are significantly smaller than for
magneto-insulating films. Excitation of microwave eddy currents in these
materials contributes to the total microwave impedance of the system. This
leads to impedance mismatch with the film environment resulting in decoupling
of the film from the environment and, ultimately, to smaller radiation losses.
We also show that the radiation losses drop with an increase in the stripline
width and when the sample is lifted up from the stripline surface. Hence, in
order to eliminate this measurement artifact one needs to use wide striplines
and introduce a spacer between the film and the sample surface. The radiation
losses contribution is larger for thicker films.

densities of the YSOs range from 1 pc$^{-2}$ to over 10,000 pc$^{-2}$, with
protostars tending to be in higher density regions. This range of densities is
similar to other surveyed molecular clouds with clusters, but broader than
clouds without clusters. By identifying clusters and groups as continuous
regions with surface densities $\ge10$ pc$^{-2}$, we find that 59% of the YSOs

YSOs are found in a distributed population. A lower fraction of protostars in
the distributed population is evidence that it is somewhat older than the

clusters and groups show that the peak surface densities of the clusters
increase approximately linearly with the number of members. Furthermore, all
clusters with more than 70 members exhibit asymmetric and/or highly elongated

suggesting that the cluster is only $\sim 2$ Myr in age. We find the star

SFEs of individual groups and clusters are an order of magnitude higher than
those of the clouds. Finally, we discuss the relationship between the young low
mass stars in the Orion clouds and the Orion OB 1 association, and we determine
upper limits to the fraction of disks that may be affected by UV radiation from

ferromagnetic-gated silicene-based junction. Silicene has buckled atomic
structure which allows us to take sublattice-dependent ferromagnetism into
account in the investigation. One of the study results show that transmission
at the junctions exhibits anisotropic property only in anti-parallel cases.
Interestingly, the studied junctions can be switched from a pure spin-polarizer
to a pure valley-polarizer by reversing directions of exchange fields in the
parallel junctions. The perfect control of spin-valley currents can be done
only in the parallel cases and its resolution can be enhanced by increasing
gate potential between the ferromagnetic barriers. The asymmetric barriers of
anti-parallel junction is found to destroy both spin and valley filtering
effects and yield a novel result, pure sub-lattice pseudo-spin polarization.
The current in the anti-parallel junctions can be controlled to flow solely in
either A or B sub-lattice, saying that the controllable lattice current in
silicene is created in double ferromagnetic-gated junction. Our work reveals
the potential of dual ferromagnetic-gated silicene junction which may be
possible for applications in spin-valleytronics and lattice-pseudospintronics.

Earth. A natural expectation would be the existence of TDEs with a relativistic
jet beaming away from Earth. The nearby TDE candidate IGR J12580+0134 provides
new insights into the jet phenomenon. Combining several constraints, we find
that the event invokes a $8-40$ Jupiter mass object tidally disrupted by a $3
\times 10^5 - 1.8 \times 10^7 M_\sun$ SMBH. Recently, a bright radio transient
was discovered by Irwin et al. in association with IGR J12580+0134. We perform
detailed modeling of the event based on a numerical jet model previously
developed for the radio emission of Sw J1644+57. We find that the radio data of
IGR J12580+0134 can be interpreted within an external forward shock model in
the Newtonian regime. Using Sw J1644+57 as a template and properly correcting
for its luminosity, we argue that the observed X-ray flux in early times is too
faint to allow an on-beam relativistic jet unless the Lorentz factor is very
small. Rather, the X-ray emission is likely from the disk or corona near the
black hole. From various constraints, we find that the data are consistent with
an off-beam relativistic jet with a viewing angle $\theta_{\rm obs} \gtrsim
30^{\rm o}$, and an initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma_j \gtrsim $ a few.This
scenario can readily be tested in the upcoming VLBI observations.

binary symmetric wiretap channels without the knowledge of instantaneous
channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. For this model, a coding
scheme that hierarchically utilizes polar codes is presented. In particular, on
polarization of different binary symmetric channels over different fading
blocks, each channel use is modeled as an appropriate binary erasure channel
over fading blocks. Polar codes are constructed for both coding over channel
uses for each fading block and coding over fading blocks for certain channel
uses. In order to guarantee security, random bits are introduced at appropriate
places to exhaust the observations of the eavesdropper. It is shown that this
coding scheme, without instantaneous CSI at the transmitter, is secrecy
capacity achieving for the simultaneous fading scenario. For the independent
fading case, the capacity is achieved when the fading realizations for the
eavesdropper channel is always degraded with respect to the receiver. For the
remaining cases, the gap is analyzed by comparing lower and upper bounds.
Remarkably, for the scenarios where the secrecy capacity is achieved, the
results imply that instantaneous CSI does not increase the secrecy capacity.

equation from the viewpoint of the integral reformulation. Moreover, we propose
a Chebyshev spectral method for the integral reformulation. The
well-conditioning of these methods is obvious by noting that the resulting
linear operator is a compact perturbation of the identity. The adaptive QR
approach for the ultraspherical spectral method still applies to the
almost-banded infinite-dimensional system arising in the Chebyshev spectral
method for the integral reformulation. Numerical examples are given to confirm
the well-conditioning of the Chebyshev spectral method.

background radiation play a crucial role for the study of the very early
Universe. However, in the real observation, the mixture of the E-mode and
B-mode can be caused by the partial sky surveys, which must be separated before
applied to the cosmological explanation. The separation method developed by
Smith (\citealt{PhysRevD.74.083002}) has been widely adopted, where the edge of
the top-hat mask should be smoothed to avoid the numerical errors. In this
paper, we compare three different smoothing methods, and investigate the
leakage residuals of the E-B mixture. We find that, if the less information
loss is needed and the smaller region is smoothed in the analysis, the
\textit{sin}- and \textit{cos}-smoothing methods are better. However, if we
need a clean constructed B-mode map, the larger region around the mask edge
should be smoothed. In this case, the \textit{Gaussian}-smoothing method
becomes much better. In addition, we find that the leakage caused by the
numerical errors in the \textit{Gaussian}-smoothing method mostly concentrates
on two bands, which is quite easy to be reduced for the further E-B
separations.

with open $f$ shells results in very large numbers of complex, chaotic
eigenstates that cannot be computed to any degree of accuracy. Describing the
processes which involve such states requires the use of a statistical theory.
Electron capture into these 'compound resonances' leads to electron-ion
recombination rates that are orders of magnitude greater than those of direct,
radiative recombination, and cannot be described by standard theories of
dielectronic recombination. Previous statistical theories considered this as a
two-electron capture process which populates a pair of single-particle
orbitals, followed by 'spreading' of the two-electron states into chaotically
mixed eigenstates. This method is similar to a configuration-average approach,
as it neglects potentially important effects of spectator electrons and
conservation of total angular momentum. In this work we develop a statistical
theory which considers electron capture into 'doorway' states with definite
angular momentum obtained by the configuration interaction method. We apply
this approach to electron recombination with W$^{20+}$, considering 2 million
doorway states. Despite strong effects from the spectator electrons, we find
that the results of the earlier theories largely hold. Finally, we extract the
fluorescence yield (the probability of photoemission and hence recombination)
by comparison with experiment.

characteristics of different devices such as screen size which is important for
mobile browsing. Today, the only W3C standard to support this adaptability is
CSS media queries. However, using media queries it is impossible to create
applications in a modular way, because responsive elements then always depend
on the global context. Hence, responsive elements can only be reused if the
global context is exactly the same, severely limiting their reusability. This
makes it extremely challenging to develop large responsive applications,
because the lack of true modularity makes certain requirement changes either
impossible or expensive to realize.
  In this paper we extend RWD to also include responsive modules, i.e., modules
that adapt their design based on their local context independently of the
global context. We present the ELQ project which implements our approach. ELQ
is a novel implementation of so-called element queries which generalize media
queries. Importantly, our design conforms to existing web specifications,
enabling adoption on a large scale. ELQ is designed to be heavily extensible
using plugins. Experimental results show speed-ups of the core algorithms of up

mergernova emission in ultraviolet/optical bands. Before the mergernova, the
early interaction between the NS wind and the ejecta can drive a forward shock
propagating outwards into the ejecta. As a result, a remarkable amount of heat
can be accumulated behind the shock front and the final escaping of this heat

Dense clumps found by C$^{18}$O emission are aligned along the dense ridge with
a regular interval about 2.8 pc, similar to the clump separation caused by
large-scale `sausage instability'. We confirm the identification of the giant

the background. The most representative problem formulation is the Robust
Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) solved via Principal Component Pursuit
(PCP) which decomposes a data matrix in a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix.
However, similar robust implicit or explicit decompositions can be made in the
following problem formulations: Robust Non-negative Matrix Factorization

Subspace Tracking (RST) and Robust Low-Rank Minimization (RLRM). The main goal
of these similar problem formulations is to obtain explicitly or implicitly a
decomposition into low-rank matrix plus additive matrices. In this context,
this work aims to initiate a rigorous and comprehensive review of the similar
problem formulations in robust subspace learning and tracking based on
decomposition into low-rank plus additive matrices for testing and ranking
existing algorithms for background/foreground separation. For this, we first
provide a preliminary review of the recent developments in the different
problem formulations which allows us to define a unified view that we called
Decomposition into Low-rank plus Additive Matrices (DLAM). Then, we examine
carefully each method in each robust subspace learning/tracking frameworks with
their decomposition, their loss functions, their optimization problem and their
solvers. Furthermore, we investigate if incremental algorithms and real-time
implementations can be achieved for background/foreground separation. Finally,
experimental results on a large-scale dataset called Background Models
Challenge (BMC 2012) show the comparative performance of 32 different robust
subspace learning/tracking methods.

been confirmed especially with the first confirmed identification of two strong
diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) with C60+. This justifies reassesing the
importance of interstellar fullerenes of various sizes with endohedral or
exohedral inclusions and heterofullerenes (EEHFs). The phenomenology of
fullerenes is complex. In addition to fullerene formation in shock shattering,
fully dehydrogenated PAHs in diffuse interstellar (IS) clouds could perhaps
efficiently transform into fullerenes including EEHFs. But it is extremely
difficult to assess their expected abundance, composition and size
distribution, except for C60+. EEHFs share many properties with C60, as regards
stability, formation/destruction and chemical processes, and many basic
spectral features. We address the interstellar importance of various EEHFs as
possible DIB carriers. Specifically, we discuss IS properties and the
contributions of fullerenes of various sizes and charge such as C60+,
metallofullerenes, heterofullerenes, fulleranes, fullerene-PAH compounds,
H2@C60. We conclude that the landscape of interstellar fullerenes is probably
much richer than heretofore realized. EEHFs, together with pure fullerenes of
various sizes, have properties necessary to be suitably carriers of DIBs:
carbonaceous nature; stability and resilience in the ISM; various heteroatoms
and ionization states; relatively easy formation; few stable isomers; right
spectral range; energy internal conversion; Jahn-Teller fine structure. This is
supported by the C60+ DIBs. But, the lack of information about optical spectra
other than C60 and IS abundances still precludes definitive assessment of the
importance of fullerenes as DIB carriers. Their compounds could significantly
contribute to DIBs, but it still seems difficult that they are the only
important DIB carriers.

computations are elementary, but they provide an expansion of the delta
distribution {\delta}_{1_G} into an infinite sum of G -invariant locally
integrable essentially compact distributions supported on the set of
topologically unipotent elements. When these distributions are transferred, by
the exponential map, to the Lie algebra, they give G -invariant distributions

propagation direction and the amplitude of KAWs that are randomly driven at a
transverse scale of about one fifth of the proton gyroradius in order to
maintain a prescribed level of turbulent fluctuations. The resulting turbulent

gravitational interactions. By considering a four-dimensional spacetime as a
hypersurface embedded in a five-dimensional bulk spacetime, we derive the
complete set of field equations in the four-dimensional spacetime from the
five-dimensional Einstein field equation. Besides the Einstein field equation
in the four-dimensional spacetime, an electromagnetic field equation is
derived: $\nabla_a F^{ab}-\xi R^b_{\;\,a}A^a=-4\pi J^b$ with $\xi=-2$, where
$F^{ab}$ is the antisymmetric electromagnetic field tensor defined by the
potential vector $A^a$, $R_{ab}$ is the Ricci curvature tensor of the
hypersurface, and $J^a$ is the electric current density vector. The
electromagnetic field equation differs from the Einstein-Maxwell equation by a
curvature-coupled term $\xi R^b_{\;\,a}A^a$, whose presence addresses the
problem of incompatibility of the Einstein-Maxwell equation with a universe
containing a uniformly distributed net charge as discussed in a previous paper
by the author [L.-X. Li, Gen. Relativ. Gravit. {\bf 48}, 28 (2016)]. Hence, the
new unified theory is physically different from the Kaluza-Klein theory and its
variants where the Einstein-Maxwell equation is derived. In the
four-dimensional Einstein field equation derived in the new theory, the source
term includes the stress-energy tensor of electromagnetic fields as well as the
stress-energy tensor of other unidentified matter. Under some conditions the
unidentified matter can be interpreted as a cosmological constant in the
four-dimensional spacetime. We argue that, the electromagnetic field equation
and hence the unified theory presented in this paper can be tested in an
environment with a high mass density, e.g., inside a neutron star or a white
dwarf, and in the early epoch of the universe.

isotones $^{37}$S and $^{35}$Si by $(d,p)$ transfer reactions. Values were
reported by using the major fragments of the states. An important reduction of
the $p$ splitting was observed, from $^{37}$S to $^{35}$Si, associated to a
strong modification of the spin--orbit potential in the central region of the
nucleus $^{35}$Si. We analyze $2p$ and $1f$ neutron spin--orbit splittings in
the $N=20$ isotones $^{40}$Ca, $^{36}$S, and $^{34}$Si. We employ several
Skyrme and Gogny interactions, to reliably isolate pure spin--orbit and
tensor--induced contributions, within the mean--field approximation. We use
interactions (i) without the tensor force; (ii) with the tensor force and with
tensor parameters adjusted on top of existing parametrizations; (iii) with the
tensor force and with tensor and spin--orbit parameters adjusted simultaneously
on top of existing parametrizations. We predict in cases (ii) and (iii) a non
negligible reduction of both $p$ and $f$ splittings, associated to
neutron--proton tensor effects, from $^{40}$Ca to $^{36}$S. The two splittings
are further decreased for the three types of interactions, going from $^{36}$S
to $^{34}$Si. This reduction is produced by the spin--orbit force and is not
affected by tensor--induced contributions. For both reductions, from $^{40}$Ca
to $^{36}$S and from $^{36}$S to $^{34}$Si, we predict in all cases that the
modification is more pronounced for $p$ than for $f$ splittings. The
measurement of the centroids for neutron $2p$ and $1f$ states in the nuclei
$^{36}$S and $^{34}$Si would be interesting to validate this prediction
experimentally. We show the importance of using interactions of type (iii),
because they provide $p$ and $f$ splittings in the nucleus $^{40}$Ca which are
in agreement with the corresponding experimental values.

the Newtonian potential generated by the matter source, while the corresponding
quantum state is given by a coherent superposition of scalar modes with
continuous occupation number. An attractive self-interaction is needed for
bound states to form, so that (approximately) one mode is allowed, and the
system of N bosons can be self-confined in a volume of the size of the
Schwarzschild radius. The HWF is then used to show that the radius of such a
system corresponds to a proper horizon. The uncertainty in the size of the
horizon is related to the typical energy of Hawking modes: it decreases with
the increasing of the black hole mass (larger number of gravitons), in
agreement with semiclassical calculations and different from a single very
massive particle. The spectrum contains a discrete ground state of energy $m$
(the bosons forming the black hole), and a continuous spectrum with energy
$\omega > m$ (representing the Hawking radiation and modelled with a Planckian
distribution at the expected Hawking temperature). The $N$-particle state can
be collectively described by a single-particle wave-function given by a
superposition of a total ground state with energy $M = N m$ and a Planckian
distribution for $E > M$ at the same Hawking temperature. The partition
function is then found to yield the usual area law for the entropy, with a
logarithmic correction related with the Hawking component. The backreaction of
modes with $\omega > m$ is also shown to reduce the Hawking flux and the
evaporation properly stops for vanishing mass.

(LambdaMART-MF), that learns a low rank latent representation of users and
items using gradient boosted trees. The algorithm factorizes lambdaMART by
defining relevance scores as the inner product of the learned representations
of the users and items. The low rank is essentially a model complexity
controller; on top of it we propose additional regularizers to constraint the
learned latent representations that reflect the user and item manifolds as
these are defined by their original feature based descriptors and the
preference behavior. Finally we also propose to use a weighted variant of NDCG
to reduce the penalty for similar items with large rating discrepancy.
  We experiment on two very different recommendation datasets, meta-mining and
movies-users, and evaluate the performance of LambdaMART-MF, with and without
regularization, in the cold start setting as well as in the simpler matrix
completion setting. In both cases it outperforms in a significant manner
current state of the art algorithms.

the Mn I 539.4 nm line has been observed for nearly three solar cycles using
the McMath telescope and the 13.5 m spectrograph in double-pass mode. These
full-disk spectrophotometric observations revealed an unusually strong change
of this line's parameters over the solar cycle. Optical pumping by the Mg II k
line was originally proposed to explain these variations. More recent studies
have proposed that this is not required and that the magnetic variability might
explain it. Magnetic variability is also the mechanism that drives the changes
in total solar irradiance variations (TSI). With this work we investigate this
proposition quantitatively by using using the model SATIRE-S. We applied
exactly the same model atmospheres and value of the free parameter as were used
in previous solar irradiance reconstructions to now model the variation in the
Mn I 539.4 nm line profile and in neighboring Fe I lines. We compared the
results of the theoretical model with KPNO observations. Our result confirms
that optical pumping of the Mn I 539.4 nm line by Mg II k is not the main cause
of its solar cycle change. It also provides independent confirmation of solar
irradiance models which are based on the assumption that irradiance variations
are caused by the evolution of the solar surface magnetic flux. The result
obtained here also supports the spectral irradiance variations computed by
these models.

vertex-coloring, edge-coloring, maximal matching, maximal independent set,
etc., is a long-standing challenge in distributed network computing. More
recently, it has also become a challenge in the framework of centralized local
computation. We introduce conflict coloring as a general symmetry-breaking task
that includes all the aforementioned tasks as specific instantiations ---
conflict coloring includes all locally checkable labeling tasks from
[Naor\&Stockmeyer, STOC 1993]. Conflict coloring is characterized by two
parameters $l$ and $d$, where the former measures the amount of freedom given
to the nodes for selecting their colors, and the latter measures the number of
constraints which colors of adjacent nodes are subject to.We show that, in the
standard LOCAL model for distributed network computing, if $l/d \textgreater{}
\Delta$, then conflict coloring can be solved in $\tilde
O(\sqrt{\Delta})+\log^*n$ rounds in $n$-node graphs with maximum degree
$\Delta$, where $\tilde O$ ignores the polylog factors in $\Delta$. The
dependency in~$n$ is optimal, as a consequence of the $\Omega(\log^*n)$ lower
bound by [Linial, SIAM J. Comp. 1992] for $(\Delta+1)$-coloring. An important
special case of our result is a significant improvement over the best known
algorithm for distributed $(\Delta+1)$-coloring due to [Barenboim, PODC 2015],
which required $\tilde O(\Delta^{3/4})+\log^*n$ rounds. Improvements for other
variants of coloring, including $(\Delta+1)$-list-coloring,
$(2\Delta-1)$-edge-coloring, $T$-coloring, etc., also follow from our general
result on conflict coloring. Likewise, in the framework of centralized local
computation algorithms (LCAs), our general result yields an LCA which requires
a smaller number of probes than the previously best known algorithm for
vertex-coloring, and works for a wide range of coloring problems.

Specifically, our model is that the patches of the underlying image(s) are

compressed sensing are highly efficient, and are guaranteed to converge to at
least the partial global and partial local minimizers of the highly non-convex

usually leads to better quality of image reconstructions in MRI compared to

biology and fluid dynamics. Recently, a major source of progress in 3D tracking
has been the study of collective behaviour in biological systems, where the
trajectories of individual animals moving within large and dense groups need to
be reconstructed to understand the behavioural interaction rules. Experimental
data in this field are generally noisy and at low spatial resolution, so that
individuals appear as small featureless objects and trajectories must be
retrieved by making use of epipolar information only. Moreover, optical
occlusions often occur: in a multi-camera system one or more objects become
indistinguishable in one view, potentially jeopardizing the conservation of
identity over long-time trajectories. The most advanced 3D tracking algorithms
overcome optical occlusions making use of set-cover techniques, which however
have to solve NP-hard optimization problems. Moreover, current methods are not
able to cope with occlusions arising from actual physical proximity of objects
in 3D space. Here, we present a new method designed to work directly in 3D
space and time, creating (3D+1) clouds of points representing the full
spatio-temporal evolution of the moving targets. We can then use a simple
connected components labeling routine, which is linear in time, to solve
optical occlusions, hence lowering from NP to P the complexity of the problem.
Finally, we use normalized cut spectral clustering to tackle 3D physical
proximity.

because of the complex interaction between the configurations of electrons and

structural degrees of freedom, often in less than one trillionth (10^-12) of a
second. Molecular dynamics induced by photoexcitation have been very
successfully studied with femtosecond optical spectroscopies, but electronic
and nuclear dynamics are often very difficult to disentangle. X-ray based
spectroscopies can reduce the ambiguity between theoretical models and
experimental data, but it is only with the recent development of bright
ultrafast X-ray sources, that key information during transient molecular
processes can be obtained on their intrinsic timescale. In this letter, Free
Electron Laser (FEL) radiation is used to measure ultrafast changes in the
X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) during the prototypical
photoreaction of a spin crossover compound. We reveal its transformation from
the ligand-located electronic photoexcitation to the structural trapping of the
high spin state. The results require a description beyond a kinetic model and
provide a direct observation of a dynamic breathing of the main structural
change. The coherent structural oscillations (period of ~265 fs) in the
photoproduct potential lose synchrony within ~330 fs, whereas incoherent
motions reveal the energy redistribution and vibrational cooling within ~1.6
ps. We foresee that ultrafast X-ray spectroscopies will provide invaluable
insight to understand the complex physics of fundamental light induced

revealed the presence of ongoing low-level star formation (SF) in the periphery
of ~10% of local early-type galaxies (ETGs), witnessing a still ongoing
inside-out galaxy growth process. A distinctive property of the nebular
component in these ETGs, classified i+, is a two-radial-zone structure, with
the inner zone displaying LINER emission with a H\alpha equivalent width
EW~1{\AA}, and the outer one (3{\AA}<EW<~20{\AA}) showing HII-region
characteristics. Using CALIFA IFS data, we empirically demonstrate that the
confinement of nebular emission to the galaxy periphery leads to a strong
aperture (or, redshift) bias in spectroscopic single-fiber studies of type i+
ETGs: At low redshift (<~0.45), SDSS spectroscopy is restricted to the inner
(SF-devoid LINER) zone, thereby leading to their erroneous classification as
""retired"" galaxies (systems lacking SF and whose faint emission is powered by
pAGB stars). Only at higher z's the SDSS aperture can encompass the outer SF
zone, permitting their unbiased classification as ""composite SF/LINER"". We also
demonstrate that the principal effect of a decreasing aperture on the
classification of i+ ETGs via standard BPT emission-line ratios consists in a
monotonic up-right shift precisely along the upper-right wing of the ""seagull""
distribution. Motivated by these insights, we also investigate theoretically
these biases in aperture-limited studies of inside-out growing galaxies as a
function of z. To this end, we devise a simple model, which involves an
outwardly propagating SF process, that reproduces the radial extent and
two-zone EW distribution of i+ ETGs. By simulating on this model the
spectroscopic SDSS aperture, we find that SDSS studies at z<~1 are
progressively restricted to the inner LINER-zone, and miss an increasingly
large portion of the H\alpha-emitting periphery.

nuclear reactions with gamma-rays is given. First of all, we discuss the impact
of phonon coupling (PC) on the photon strength function (PSF) because it
represents the most natural physical source of additional strength found for Sn
isotopes in recent experiments that could not be explained within the stan-
dard HFB+QRPA approach. The self-consistent version of the Extended Theory of
Finite Fermi Systems in the Quasiparticle Time Blocking Approximation, or
simply QTBA, is applied. It uses the HFB mean field and includes both the QRPA
and PC effects on the basis of the SLy4 Skyrme force. With our microscopic E1
PSFs, the following properties have been calculated for many stable and
unstable even-even semi-magic Sn and Ni isotopes as well as for double-magic
132Sn and 208Pb using the reaction codes EMPIRE and TALYS with several nuclear
level density (NLD) models: 1) the neutron capture cross sections, 2) the
corresponding neutron capture gamma spectra, 3) the av- erage radiative widths
of neutron resonances. In all the properties considered, the PC contribution
turned out to be significant, as compared with the standard QRPA one, and
necessary to explain the available experimental data. The results with the
phenomenological so-called generalized super- fluid NLD model turned out to be
worse, on the whole, than those obtained with the microscopic HFB+combinatorial
NLD model. Finally, we also discuss the modern microscopic NLD models based on
the self-consistent HFB method and show their relevance to explain experimental
data as compared with the phenomeno- logical models. The use of these
self-consistent microscopic approaches is of particular relevance for nuclear
astrophysics, but also for the study of double-magic nuclei.

The design efforts primarily concentrate on shifting the operation wavelength
or enhancing the local fields by manipulating the size and shape of the
nanoantenna. Here, we propose a design path to control the absorption and
scattering characteristics of a dipole nanoantenna by introducing a hollow
region inside the nanostructure. The resulting contour geometry can
significantly suppress the scattering of the dipole nanoantenna and enhance its
absorption simultaneously. Both the dipole and the contour dipole nanoantenna
couple to equivalent amount of the incident radiation. The dipole nanoantenna
scatters 84% of the coupled power (absorbs the remaining 16%) whereas the
contour dipole structure scatters only 28% of the coupled power (absorbs the
remaining 72%). This constitutes the transformation from scatter to absorber
nanoantenna. The scattering of a contour nanoantenna can be further suppressed
by incorporating a lossless dielectric in the hollow region without altering
its absorption. We also demonstrate the applicability of scattering suppression
and absorption enhancement features of the contour design in other nanoantenna
geometries such as the self-assembly compatible nanoantenna structures of
nanodisk and nanoring chains. The benefits of the contour design can be readily
utilized in diverse applications; including bioplasmonics, medical
diagnosis/therapy, cloaked sensing, photovoltaics and thermoplasmonics.

graphene always presents a non-vanishing minimum value independently of any
material and physical condition, the transmission coefficient being higher in
the presence of a substrate, and getting increasing when QED corrections higher
than alpha come into play. Explicit numerical calculations for typical cases
are carried out when an external magnetic field is applied to the sample,
showing that, in epitaxial graphene, a threshold effect exists leading to a non
trivial minimum transmission, for a non vanishing light frequency, only for
field values larger than a critical one, both in the large and in the
intermediate chemical potential regime. Such a threshold effect manifests even
in the maximum Faraday rotation polarization of light, which is substantially
controlled by the applied magnetic field. Instead, more transmission minima in
suspended graphene enters in the considered light frequency region for
increasing magnetic field, displaying an effective shift of frequency bands
where the sample gets more or less absorptive with a suitable tuning of the
external field. Two transition regions in different magnetic field ranges are
found, where the shift effect towards higher frequency values occurs both in
the transmission coefficient and in the Faraday rotation angle. Potential
technological application of the results presented are envisaged.

important because any evidence of its violation could be a signal of new
physics. In this paper we introduce a new method to test DDR based on strong
gravitational lensing systems and type Ia supernovae under a flat universe. The
method itself is worth attention, because unlike previously proposed
techniques, it does not depend on all other prior assumptions concerning the
details of cosmological model. We tested it using a new compilation of strong

companions to four binary radio millisecond pulsars, leading to the discovery
of companions to PSRs J0614-3329, J1231-1411 and J2017+0603. We place limits on
the brightness of the companion to PSR J0613-0200. Optical spectroscopy of the
companion to PSR J0614-3329 identifies it as a DA type white dwarf with a
temperature of Teff=6460+-80 K, a surface gravity log g=7.0+-0.2 cgs and a mass
of Mwd=0.24+-0.04 Msun. We find that the distance to PSR J0614-3329 is smaller
than previously estimated, removing the need for the pulsar to have an
unrealistically high gamma-ray efficiency. Comparing the photometry with
predictions from white dwarf cooling models allows us to estimate temperatures
and cooling ages of the companions to PSRs J0613-0200, J1231-1411 and
J2017+0603. We find that the white dwarfs in these systems are cool Teff<4000 K
and old >5 Gyr. Thin Hydrogen envelopes are required for these white dwarfs to
cool to the observed temperatures, and we suggest that besides Hydrogen shell
flashes, irradiation driven mass loss by the pulsar may have been important.

optical microscopy and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, we demonstrate that
ordered interfaces with well-defined orientations of adsorbed dipoles induce
planar anchoring locked along the adsorbed dipoles or the alkyl chains, which
play the role of easy axes. For two alternating orientations of the adsorbed
dipoles or dipoles and alkyl chains, bi-stability of anchoring can be obtained.
The results are explained using the introduction of fourth order terms in the
phenomenological anchoring potential, leading to the demonstration of first
order anchoring transition in these systems. Using this phenomenological
anchoring potential, we finally show how the nature of anchoring in presence of
dual easy axes (inducing bi-stability or average orientation between the two
easy axes) can be related to the microscopical nature of the interface.
Introduction Understanding the interactions between liquid crystal (LC) and a
solid substrate is of clear applied interest, the vast majority of LC displays
relying on control of interfaces. However this concerns also fundamental
problems like wetting phenomena and all phenomena of orientation of soft matter
bulk induced by the presence of an interface. In LCs at interfaces, the
so-called easy axes correspond to the favoured orientations of the LC director
close to the interface. If one easy axis only is defined for one given
interface, the bulk director orients along or close to this axis [1]. It is
well known that, in anchoring phenomena, two major effects compete to impose
the anchoring directions of a liquid crystal, first, the interactions between
molecules and the interface, second, the substrate roughness whose role has
been analyzed by Berreman [2]. The influence of adsorbed molecular functional
groups at the interface is most often dominant with, for example in carbon
substrates, a main influence of unsaturated carbon bonds orientation at the
interface [3]. In common LC displays, there is one unique easy axis, but
modifications of surfaces have allowed for the discovery of promising new
anchoring-related properties. For instance, the first anchoring bi-stability
has been established on rough surfaces, associated with electric
ordo-polarization [4] and the competition between a stabilizing short-range
term and a destabilizing long-range term induced by an external field, can
induce a continuous variation of anchoring orientation [5]. More recently,
surfaces with several easy axes have been studied extensively. It has been
shown that control of a continuous variation of director pretilt, obtained in
several systems [6, 7], is associated with the presence of two different easy
axes, one perpendicular to the substrate (homeotropic) and one planar [7, 8].
Similar models can explain the continuous evolution of anchoring between two
planar orientations observed on some crystalline substrates [9]. However, in
the same time, two easy axes can also lead to anchoring bi-stability [10, 11]
or discontinuous transitions of anchoring [9], which is not compatible with the
model established to interpret observed control of pretilt. In order to be able
to predict if bi-stability or continuous combination of the two easy axes
occurs for one given system, it becomes necessary to understand the microscopic
origin of the easy axes.

mixing of partially processed CNO material. Both our measurements of [C/Fe] and

the contribution of different nucleosynthesis sources over time to a not

the long time relaxation behavior is dominated by the mutual diffusion in

problems in solar flare physics. An accurate determination of the spectrum of
flare energized electrons over a broad energy range is crucial for our
understanding of aspects such as the acceleration mechanism and the total flare
energy. Recent years have seen a growing interest in the kappa-distribution as
representation of the total spectrum of flare accelerated electrons. In this
work we present the kappa-distribution as a differential emission measure. This
allows for inferring the electron distribution from X-ray observations and EUV
observations by simultaneously fitting the proposed function to RHESSI and
SDO/AIA data. This yields the spatially integrated electron spectra of a
coronal source between less than 0.1 keV up to several tens of keV. The method
is applied to a single-loop GOES C4.1 flare. The results show that the total
energy can only be determined accurately by combining RHESSI and AIA
observations. Simultaneously fitting the proposed representation of the
kappa-distribution reduces the electron number density in the analyzed flare by
a factor of ~30 and the total flare energy by a factor of ~5 compared with the
commonly used fitting of RHESSI spectra. The spatially integrated electron
spectrum of the investigated flare between 0.043 keV and 24 keV is consistent
with the combination of a low-temperature (~2 MK) component and a hot (~11 MK)
kappa-like component with spectral index 4, reminiscent of solar wind

We computed the resulting Poynting flux depending on the ratio~$R/\rlight$ and
on frame-dragging through the spin parameter~$\as$, $R$ is the neutron star

increase the total Poynting flux seen by a distant observer by a factor up to~2

proved straightforward in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and lens of the eye.
In skeletal muscle, measurements provided the best estimates of the predominant
(cell) membrane system that dominates electrical properties. In cardiac muscle,
measurements showed definitively that classical microelectrode voltage clamp
could not control the potential of the predominant membranes, that were in the
tubular system separated from the extracellular space by substantial
distributed resistance. In the lens of the eye, impedance spectroscopy changed
the basis of all recording and interpretation of electrical measurements and
laid the basis for Rae and Mathias extensive later experimental work. Many
tissues are riddled with extracellular space as clefts and tubules, for
example, cardiac muscle, the lens of the eye, most epithelia, and of course
frog muscle. These tissues are best analyzed with a bidomain theory that arose
from the work on electrical structure described here. There has been a great
deal of work since then on the bi-domain and this represents the most important
contribution to biology of the analysis of electrical structure in my view.

  High-Dimensional Binary Data","21 pages, 3 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new family of one factor distributions for high-dimensional
binary data. The model provides an explicit probability for each event, thus
avoiding the numeric approximations often made by existing methods. Model
interpretation is easy since each variable is described by two continuous
parameters (corresponding to its marginal probability and to its strength of
dependency with the other variables) and by one binary parameter (defining if
the dependencies are positive or negative). An extension of this new model is
proposed by assuming that the variables are split into independent blocks which
follow the new one factor distribution. Parameter estimation is performed by
the inference margin procedure where the second step is achieved by an
expectation-maximization algorithm. Model selection is carried out by a
deterministic approach which strongly reduces the number of competing models.
This approach uses a hierarchical ascendant classification of the variables
based on the empirical version of Cramer's V for selecting a narrow subset of
models. The consistency of such procedure is shown. The new model is evaluated
on numerical experiments and on a real data set. The procedure is implemented
in the R package MvBinary available on CRAN.

connections under random losses. Throughput expressions for TCP Compound under
a deterministic loss model exist in the literature. These are obtained assuming
the window sizes are continuous, i.e., a fluid behaviour is assumed. We
validate this model theoretically. We show that under the deterministic loss
model, the TCP window evolution for TCP Compound is periodic and is independent
of the initial window size. We then consider the case when packets are lost
randomly and independently of each other. We discuss Markov chain models to
analyze performance of TCP in this scenario. We use insights from the
deterministic loss model to get an appropriate scaling for the window size
process and show that these scaled processes, indexed by p, the packet error
rate, converge to a limit Markov chain process as p goes to 0. We show the
existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution for this limit process.
Using the stationary distribution for the limit process, we obtain
approximations for throughput, under random losses, for TCP Compound when
packet error rates are small. We compare our results with ns2 simulations which
show a good match.

magnetic monopoles that could have been created during an early high-energy

accelerated by cosmic magnetic fields and could reach high velocities that make
them visible in Cherenkov detectors such as IceCube.
  Equivalently to electrically charged particles, magnetic monopoles produce
direct and indirect Cherenkov light while traversing through matter at
relativistic velocities.
  This paper describes searches for relativistic (v>0.76c) and mildly
relativistic (v>0.51c) monopoles, each using one year of data taken in 2008/09
and 2011/12 respectively. No monopole candidate was detected. For a velocity
above 0.51c the monopole flux is constrained down to a level of 1.55x10^-18

measurements, especially at high redshift where sources are harder to resolve.
One measures either changes in the source density (magnification bias) or in
the shape of the flux distribution (e.g. magnitude-shift). The interpretation
of these measurements relies on theoretical estimates of how the observables
change under magnification. Here we present simulations to create multi-band
photometric mock catalogues of Lyman-break galaxies in a CFHTLenS-like survey
that include several observational effects that can change these relations,
making simple theoretical estimates unusable. In particular, we show how the
magnification bias can be affected by photometric noise, colour selection, and
dust extinction. We find that a simple measurement of the slope of the
number-counts is not sufficient for the precise interpretation of virtually all
observations of magnification bias. We also explore how sensitive the shift in
the mean magnitude of a source sample in different photometric bands is to
magnification including the same observational effects. Again we find
significant deviations from simple analytical estimates. We also discover a
wavelength-dependence of the magnitude-shift effect when applied to a
colour-selected noisy source sample. Such an effect can mimic the reddening by
dust in the lens. It has to be disentangled from the dust extinction before the
magnitude-shift/colour-excess can be used to measure the distribution of either
dark matter or extragalactic dust. Using simulations like the ones presented
here these observational effects can be studied and eventually removed from
observations making precise measurements of flux magnification possible.

its intimate coupling to an ultrathin Bi2Te2Se nanoplatelet within a van der

scales inversely with temperature, is detectable up to ~15 K. Our findings
establish topological insulators as prospective future components of spintronic
devices wherein spin manipulation is achieved by purely electrical means.

The SAW invokes a drift of mass in the liquid film, which is associated with
the Schlichting boundary layer flow (also known as the Schlichting streaming).
We study thin films that are governed by a balance between the drift and
capillary stress alone. We demonstrate weak capillary contributions, such as
for silicon oil films, support dynamic wetting and lead to the spreading of the
liquid over the solid substrate along the path of the SAW. Strong capillary
contributions, such as for water films, support however a concurrent dynamic
wetting and dewetting along the path of the SAW, such that the film displace
along the solid substrate. In addition, such films may support the formation of
a capillary train-wave that propagate along the the same path. We further note
the mechanism for film dynamics we discuss here is different to the more
familiar Eckart streaming mechanism, which is associated with a film thickness
that is greater than the wavelength of the sound leakage off the SAW and
usually observed to support the motion of drops. The thickness of the films we
discuss here is small in respect to the wavelength of the sound leakage,
rendering contributions from the Eckart streaming, acoustic radiation pressure,
and the attenuation of the SAW small.

circuits based on a general technique called Logic Relaxation (LoR). The
essence of LoR is to relax the formula to be solved and compute a superset S of
the set of new behaviors. Namely, S contains all new satisfying assignments
that appeared due to relaxation and does not contain assignments satisfying the
original formula. Set S is generated by a procedure called partial quantifier
elimination. If all possible bad behaviors are in S, the original formula
cannot have them and so the property described by this formula holds. The
appeal of EC by LoR is twofold. First, it facilitates generation of powerful
inductive proofs. Second, proving inequivalence comes down to checking the
presence of some bad behaviors in the relaxed formula i.e. in a simpler version
of the original formula. We give some experimental evidence that supports our
approach.

different directions. Coherent radiation emission in a downstream undulator is
expected to be dramatically suppressed as soon as the kick angle becomes larger
than the divergence of the output radiation. In fact, according to conventional
treatments, coherent radiation is emitted along the normal to the microbunching
wavefront. Here we show that kinematics predicts a surprising effect. Namely, a
description of coherent undulator radiation in the laboratory frame yields the
radical notion that, due light aberration, strong coherent radiation is
produced along the direction of the kick. We hold a recent FEL study made at
the LCLS as a direct experimental evidence that coherent undulator radiation
can be kicked by an angle of about five times the rms radiation divergence

within the LR run. In HR quantities such local Rossby number, horizontal
divergence, vertical velocity, and strain rate are amplified in winter, when
the mixed layer is deepest, as found in other basins. In the model
configuration considered this amplification occurs in surface waters over the
continental slope and off-shore but not over the shelf. Submesoscale structures
consist of a mixture of fronts and eddies generated by frontogenesis and mixed
layer instabilities, with elevated conversion rates of available potential
energy (APE) into eddy kinetic energy (EKE). In all quantities a secondary
maximum emerges during the summer season, when the mixed layer depth is
shallowest, barely 15-20 m. The secondary peak extends to the coast and is due
to the intense lateral density gradients created by the fresh water inflow from
the Mississippi River system. Submesoscale structures in summer consist
predominately of fronts, as observed in the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater
Horizon oil spill, and their secondary circulations are impeded due to the
limited depth of the mixed layer. Freshwater river input is key to the
submesoscale activity in summer but modulates it also in winter, as shown with
a sensitivity run in which the riverine inflow is absent. Implications for

The metastatic process was simplified here into two essential components --
dissemination and colonization -- which were mathematically formalized in terms
of simple quantitative laws. The resulting mathematical model was confronted to
in vivo experimental data of spontaneous metastasis after primary tumor
resection. We discuss how much information can be inferred from confrontation
of theories to the data with emphasis on identifiability issues. It is shown
that two mutually exclusive assumptions for the secondary growth law (namely
same or different from the primary tumor growth law) could fit equally well the

black hole (BH; 10^2 < M_BH < 10^6 Msun) embedded in a dense gas cloud with a
low abundance of metals, performing one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations
which include multi-frequency radiation transfer and non-equilibrium primordial
chemistry. We find that rapid gas supply from the Bondi radius at a
hyper-Eddington rate can occur without being impeded by radiation feedback when
(n/10^5 cm^-3) > (M_BH/10^4Msun)^{-1}(T/10^4 K)^{3/2}, where n and T are the
density and temperature of ambient gas outside of the Bondi radius. The
resulting accretion rate in this regime is steady, and larger than 3000 times
the Eddington rate. At lower Bondi rates, the accretion is episodic due to
radiative feedback and the average rate is limited below the Eddington rate.
For the hyper-Eddington case, the steady solution consists of two parts: a
radiation-dominated central core, where photon trapping due to electron
scattering is important, and an accreting envelope which follows a Bondi
profile with T~8000 K. When the emergent luminosity is limited below the
Eddington luminosity because of photon trapping, radiation from the central
region does not affect the gas dynamics at larger scales. We apply our result
to the rapid formation of massive BHs in protogalaxies with a virial
temperature of T_vir> 10^4 K. Once a seed BH forms at the center of the galaxy,
it can grow up to a maximum ~10^5 (T_vir/10^4 K) Msun via gas accretion
independent of the initial BH mass. Finally, we discuss possible observational
signatures of rapidly accreting BHs with/without allowance for dust. We suggest
that these systems could explain Lya emitters without X-rays and luminous
infrared sources with hot dust emission, respectively.

In this study, we extend the class of auxiliary equations of classical
Bernoulli equation which considered by various researchers [27, 31, 32, 33, 34,
35] to a variable-coefficient Bernoulli type equation. The proposed
variable-coefficient Bernoulli type auxiliary equation produces many new
solutions comparing to classical Bernoulli equation which produce two solutions
only. Consequently, we introduce new exact travelling wave solutions of some
physical systems in terms of these new solutions of the variable-coefficient
Bernoulli type equation.

would be important for both theoretical and applied physics. However, the

we theoretically show that a particle-antiparticle pair can form the so-called
packaged entangled states which encapsulate all the necessary physical
quantities for completely identifying the particles. The particles in the
packaged entangled states are indeterminate and exhibit unusual properties.
Thereafter, we discussed the possible applications of these new entangled
states, i.e., the protocol for teleporting the entire quantum state of a
particle (or an antiparticle) to an arbitrarily large distance without a
classical channel, transfer of the new entangled states from a particle pair to
another particle pair, and new interpretation to the matter-antimatter
asymmetry of the observable universe.

continental slope in the northern Gulf of Mexico at depths greater than 1000 m.
The investigation is performed using a regional model run at two horizontal
grid resolutions, 5 km and 1.6 km, over a three year period from January 2010
to December 2012. Ageostrophic submesoscale eddies, and vorticity filaments
populate the continental slope, and they are stronger and more abundant in the
simulation at higher resolution, as to be expected. They are formed from
horizontal shear layers at the edges of highly intermittent,
bottom-intensified, along-slope boundary currents and in the cores of those
currents when they are confined on steep slopes. The horizontal resolution
influences the representation of the lateral and vertical transport of
neutrally buoyant tracers. This is exemplified by a passive dye deployed near
the Macondo Prospect, where the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in 2010, and at
the largest known natural hydrocarbon seep in the northern Gulf, few hundred
kilometers to the west of the rig wellhead. The first site is characterized by
weak mean currents and, in the high resolution run, by intense submesoscale
eddies that form to the west of the Macondo Prospect. GC600, on the other hand,
is surrounded by a complicated bathymetry, and its flow is highly variable. The
trapping exerted by the submesoscale eddies and vorticity filaments near the
rig constrain the spreading in the vicinity of the Macondo Prospect, and as a
result, patchiness in the passive tracer distributions differs in the two
integrations, despite similar diffusivities expressing the average spreading
rate. The tracer released at GC600, on the other hand, is dispersed more
effectively in the first six months in the higher resolution case due to
enhanced near-bottom turbulent mixing.
