newly discovered superconductor FeS, which has an isostructure of the iron

revealed by both resistive and magnetization measurements. It is found that the
upper critical field is relatively low, with however an rather large anisotropy
$\Gamma=[(dH_{c2}^{ab}/dT)/(dH_{c2}^{c}/dT)]_{T_c}\approx5.8$. A huge
magnetoresistivity (290$\%$ at 9T and 10K, ${H}$ $\parallel$ c-axis) together
with a non-linear behavior of Hall resistivity vs. external field are observed.
A two-band model is applied to fit the magnetoresistance and non-linear
transverse resistivity, yielding the basic parameters of the electron and hole
bands.

branch switchings of complex functions. Using this representation, we obtain
the analytical gradient of the price of a vanilla option with respect to the

efficient implementation which is around ten times faster than a numerical
gradient. We choose the Levenberg-Marquardt method to calibrate the model and
do not observe multiple local minima reported in previous research.
Two-dimensional sections show that the objective function is shaped as a narrow

designated as either oxygen-rich or carbon-rich, although dual-dust chemistry
objects, whose infrared spectra reveal both silicate- and carbon-dust features,
are also known. The exact origin and nature of this dual-dust chemistry is not
yet understood. Spitzer-IRS mid-infrared spectroscopic imaging of the nearby,
oxygen-rich planetary nebula NGC6720 reveals the presence of the 11.3 micron
aromatic (PAH) emission band. It is attributed to emission from neutral PAHs,
since no band is observed in the 7 to 8 micron range. The spatial distribution
of PAHs is found to closely follow that of the warm clumpy molecular hydrogen
emission. Emission from both neutral PAHs and warm H2 is likely to arise from
photo-dissociation regions associated with dense knots that are located within
the main ring. The presence of PAHs together with the previously derived high
abundance of free carbon (relative to CO) suggest that the local conditions in
an oxygen-rich environment can also become conducive to in-situ formation of
large carbonaceous molecules, such as PAHs, via a bottom-up chemical pathway.
In this scenario, the same stellar source can enrich the interstellar medium
with both oxygen-rich dust and large carbonaceous molecules.

of the Hamiltonian function describing the resonant behaviour is studied on the
representative planes that allows us to investigate a large domain of the phase
space of the three-body problem without time-expensive numerical integrations
of the equations of motion, and without any restriction on the magnitude of the
planetary eccentricities. The families of the well known Apsidal Corotation

their stability is analyzed. The main dynamical features in the domains around
ACR are also investigated in detail by means of spectral analysis techniques,
which allow us to detect the regions of different regimes of motion of resonant
systems. The construction of dynamical maps for various values of the total
angular momentum shows the evolution of domains of stable motion with the
eccentricities, identifying possible configurations suitable for exoplanetary
systems.

capillarity-driven infiltration of mesoporous silica glass by hydrocarbons.
Square-root-of-time Lucas-Washburn invasion kinetics are found for linear
alkanes from n-decane (C10) to n-hexacontane (C60) and for squalane, a branched
alkane, in porous Vycor with 6.5 nm or 10 nm pore diameter, respectively.
Humidity-dependent experiments allow us to study the influence on the
imbibition kinetics of water layers adsorbed on the pore walls. Except for the
longest molecule studied, C60, the invasion kinetics can be described by bulk
fluidity and bulk capillarity, provided we assume a sticking, pore-wall
adsorbed boundary layer, i.e. a monolayer of water covered by a monolayer of
flat-laying hydrocarbons. For C60, however, an enhanced imbibition speed
compared to the value expected in the bulk is found. This suggests the onset of
velocity slippage at the silica walls or a reduced shear viscosity due to the
transition towards a polymer-like flow in confined geometries. Both, light
scattering and neutron imaging indicate a pronounced roughening of the
imbibition fronts. Their overall shape and width can be resolved by neutron
imaging. The fronts can be described by a superposition of independent wetting
fronts moving with pore size-dependent square-root-of-time laws and weighted
according to the pore size distributions obtained from nitrogen gas sorption
isotherms. This finding indicates that the shape of the imbibition front in a
porous medium, such as Vycor glass, with interconnected, elongated pores, is
solely determined by independent movements of liquid menisci. These are
dictated by the Laplace pressure and hydraulic permeability variations and thus
the pore size variation at the invasion front. Our results suggest that pore
size distributions can be derived from the broadening of imbibition fronts.

transverse RM gradients have been reported across a number of parsec-scale AGN
jets, the same is not true on kiloparsec scales, suggesting that other (e.g.
random) B-field components usually dominate on these larger scales. We have
identified an extended, monotonic transverse RM gradient across the Northern
lobe of a previously published Very Large Array (kiloparsec-scale) RM image of
5C4.114. We reanalyzed these VLA data in order to determine the significance of
this RM gradient. The RM gradient across the Northern kiloparsec-scale lobe
structure of 5C4.114 has a statistical significance of about 4sigma. There is
also a somewhat less prominent monotonic transverse RM gradient across the
Southern jet/lobe (significance ~ 3sigma). Other parts of the RM distribution
observed across the source are patchy and show no obvious order.This suggests
that we are observing a random RM component associated with the foreground
material in the cluster in which the radio source is located and through which
it is viewed, superposed on a more ordered RM component that arises in the
immediate vicinity of the AGN jets. We interpret the transverse RM gradient as
reflecting the systematic variations of the line-of-sight component of a
helical or toroidal B field associated with the jets of 5C4.114. These results
suggest that the helical field that arises due to the joint action of the
rotation of the central black hole and its accretion disc and the jet outflow
can survive to distances of thousands of parsec from the central engine.

satellites or field objects-- suffer from the so called ""too big to fail""
(TBTF) problem. Put simply, the TBTF problem consists of the fact that it is
difficult to explain both the measured kinematics of dwarfs and their observed
number density within the LCDM framework. The most popular proposed solutions
to the problem involve baryonic feedback processes. For example, reionization
and baryon depletion can decrease the abundance of halos that are expected to
host dwarf galaxies. Moreover, feedback related to star formation can alter the
dark matter density profile in the central regions of low-mass halos. In this
article we assess the TBTF problem for field dwarfs, taking explicitly into
account the baryonic effects mentioned above. We find that 1) reionization
feedback cannot resolve the TBTF problem on its own, because the halos in
question are too massive to be affected by it, and that 2) the degree to which
profile modification can be invoked as a solution to the TBTF problem depends
on the radius at which galactic kinematics are measured. Based on a literature
sample of about 90 dwarfs with interferometric observations in the 21cm line of
atomic hydrogen (HI), we conclude that the TBTF problem persists despite
baryonic effects. However, the preceding statement assumes that the sample
under consideration is representative of the general population of field
dwarfs. In addition, the unexplained excess of dwarf galaxies in LCDM could be
as small as a factor of ~ 1.8, given the current uncertainties in the
measurement of the galactic velocity function. Both of these caveats highlight
the importance of upcoming uniform surveys with HI interferometers for
advancing our understanding of the issue.

we introduce a model based on a natural bilateral communication channel
selection mechanism, which for one channel leads to consistent changes in the

the entries which does not only hold for all continuous distributions but also
for discrete ones in a generic sense. To our knowledge, this constitutes the
first universality result concerning the mean number of zeros of random
trigonometric polynomials. Besides, this is also the first time that one makes
use of the celebrated Kac-Rice formula not only for continuous random variables
as it was the case so far, but also for discrete ones. Beyond the proof of a

astronomy is the potential for new discoveries. Recognizing and characterizing
unanticipated signals requires data analysis techniques which do not depend on
theoretical predictions for the gravitational waveform. Past searches for
short-duration un-modeled gravitational wave signals have been hampered by
transient noise artifacts, or ""glitches,"" in the detectors. In some cases, even
high signal-to-noise simulated astrophysical signals have proven difficult to
distinguish from glitches, so that essentially any plausible signal could be
detected with at most 2-3 $\sigma$ level confidence. We have put forth the
BayesWave algorithm to differentiate between generic gravitational wave
transients and glitches, and to provide robust waveform reconstruction and
characterization of the astrophysical signals. Here we study BayesWave's
capabilities for rejecting glitches while assigning high confidence to
detection candidates through analytic approximations to the Bayesian evidence.

tenants is crucial. While the hypervisor enforces software isolation, shared
hardware, such as the CPU cache or memory bus, can leak sensitive information.
For security reasons, shared memory between tenants is typically disabled.
Furthermore, tenants often do not share a physical CPU. In this setting, cache
attacks do not work and only a slow cross-CPU covert channel over the memory
bus is known. In contrast, we demonstrate a high-speed covert channel as well
as the first side-channel attack working across processors and without any

mappings.
  We present two methods to reverse engineer the mapping of memory addresses to
DRAM channels, ranks, and banks. One uses physical probing of the memory bus,
the other runs entirely in software and is fully automated. Using this mapping,
we introduce DRAMA attacks, a novel class of attacks that exploit the DRAM row
buffer that is shared, even in multi-processor systems. Thus, our attacks work
in the most restrictive environments. First, we build a covert channel with a
capacity of up to 2 Mbps, which is three to four orders of magnitude faster
than memory-bus-based channels. Second, we build a side-channel template attack
that can automatically locate and monitor memory accesses. Third, we show how

it provides the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and a set of identities useful for
different applications in integrable systems. The dynamical $R$-matrices
satisfy the Gervais-Neveu-Felder (or dynamical Yang-Baxter) equation. Relation
between the dynamical and non-dynamical cases is described by the IRF-Vertex

purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we prove that the ACF elliptic
$R$-matrix satisfies the associative Yang-Baxter equation with shifted spectral
parameters. Second, we directly prove a simple relation of the IRF-Vertex type
between the Baxter-Belavin and the ACF elliptic $R$-matrices predicted
previously by Avan and Rollet. It provides the higher order $R$-matrix

the intertwining transformation as matrix extension of scalar theta function

major challenge is the design of a suitable quality metric of projections,

Pursuit algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a new information-theoretic
strategy for tackling this problem, based on quantifying the amount of
information the projection conveys to a user given their prior beliefs about
the data. The resulting projection index is a subjective quantity, explicitly
dependent on the intended user. As a useful illustration, we developed this
idea for two particular kinds of prior beliefs. The first kind leads to PCA
(Principal Component Analysis), shining new light on when PCA is (not)
appropriate. The second kind leads to a novel projection index, the
maximization of which can be regarded as a robust variant of PCA. We show how
this projection index, though non-convex, can be effectively maximized using a
modified power method as well as using a semidefinite programming relaxation.
The usefulness of this new projection index is demonstrated in comparative
empirical experiments against PCA and a popular Projection Pursuit method.

problems. These problems become intractable when the dimensionality of the data

construct convex relaxations of these combinatorial problems, which can be
solved efficiently for large scale datasets.
  Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations are among the most powerful
methods in this family, and are surprisingly well-suited for a broad range of
problems where data take the form of matrices or graphs. It has been observed
several times that, when the `statistical noise' is small enough, SDP
relaxations correctly detect the underlying combinatorial structures.
  In this paper we develop asymptotic predictions for several `detection
thresholds,' as well as for the estimation error above these thresholds. We
study some classical SDP relaxations for statistical problems motivated by
graph synchronization and community detection in networks. We map these
optimization problems to statistical mechanics models with vector spins, and
use non-rigorous techniques from statistical mechanics to characterize the
corresponding phase transitions. Our results clarify the effectiveness of SDP
relaxations in solving high-dimensional statistical problems.

small periodic annual deviations of the data points from an exponential decay -
of uncertain origin. We here analyze this dataset by power spectrum analysis
and by forming spectrograms and phasegrams. We confirm the occurrence of annual
oscillations but we also find evidence of oscillations in a band of frequencies
appropriate for the internal rotation of the Sun. Both datasets show clear
evidence of a transient oscillation with a frequency of 12.7 cycles per year
that falls in the range of rotational frequencies for the solar radiative zone.
We repeat these analyses for 358 neutrino measurements acquired by
Super-Kamiokande over the interval May 1986 to August 2001. Spectrogram
analysis yields a strong and steady oscillation at about 9.5 cycles per year
and an intermittent oscillation with frequency in the range 12.5 - 12.7 cycles
per year. We attribute the former to rotation of the solar core and the latter
to rotation in the radiative zone. Since the flux of neutrinos (8B neutrinos)
responsible for the Super-Kamiokande measurements is known, we are able to
estimate the cross sections for the beta-decay oscillations at 12.7 cycles per
year. These estimates are found to be 10-21.6 cm-2 for 36Cl and 10-18.4 cm-2
for 32Si. We suggest that the beta-decay process is influenced by neutrinos,
and that the solar neutrino flux is modulated by magnetic field in the deep
solar interior by Resonant Spin Flavor Precession.

order constraints of the form $\theta_i \leq \theta_j$ can be reparameterized
with auxiliary parameters $\eta\in [0,1]$ to replace the original parameters by
$\theta_i = \eta\cdot\theta_j$. This approach is especially common in
multinomial processing tree (MPT) modeling because the reparameterized, less
complex model also belongs to the MPT class. Here, we discuss the importance of
adjusting the prior distributions for the auxiliary parameters of a
reparameterized model. This adjustment is important for computing the Bayes
factor, a model selection criterion that measures the evidence in favor of an
order constraint by trading off model fit and complexity. We show that uniform
priors for the auxiliary parameters result in a Bayes factor that differs from
the one that is obtained using a multivariate uniform prior on the
order-constrained original parameters. As a remedy, we derive the adjusted
priors for the auxiliary parameters of the reparameterized model. The practical
relevance of the problem is underscored with a concrete example using the
multi-trial pair-clustering model.

conflicting optimization objectives, nondeterminism, and the need to reason

combine {\em logical} satisfiability criteria with traditional {\em numerical}
optimization, to reach a desired traffic flow outcome subject to given
constraints on the routing process. The method can then be used to probe
parameter sensitivity, trade-offs in the selection of optimization goals,
resilience to failure, and so forth. The theory is underpinned by a rigorous

groove is a narrow trough around a fixed angular momentum from which most stars
have been removed, rendering part of the disc unresponsive to spiral waves. We
find that a groove can dramatically alter a disc's eigenmode spectrum by giving
rise to a set of vigorously growing eigenmodes. These eigenmodes are particular
to the grooved disc and are absent from the original ungrooved disc's mode
spectrum. We discuss the properties and possible origin of the different
families of new modes.
  By the very nature of our technique, we prove that a narrow phase-space
groove can be a source of rapidly growing spiral patterns that are true
eigenmodes of the grooved disc and that no non-linear processes need to be
invoked to explain their presence in N-body simulations of disc galaxies. Our
results lend support to the idea that spiral structure can be a recurrent

collisionless N-body simulations of minor mergers and a particle tagging
technique to understand how these different ingredients shape each contribution
to the accreted halo, in both density and kinematics. I find that more massive
satellites deposit their stars deeper into the gravitational potential of the
host, with a clear segregation enforced by dynamical friction. Earlier
accretion events contribute more to the inner regions of the halo; more
concentrated subhaloes sink deeper through increased dynamical friction. The
orbital circularity of the progenitor at infall is only important for low-mass
satellites: dynamical friction efficiently radialises the most massive minor
mergers erasing the imprint of the infall orbit for satellite-to-host virial
mass ratios $\gtrsim1/20$. The kinematics of the stars contributed by each
satellite is also ordered with satellite mass: low-mass satellites contribute
fast-moving populations, in both ordered rotation and radial velocity
dispersion. In turn, contributions by massive satellites have lower velocity
dispersion and lose their angular momentum to dynamical friction, resulting in
a strong radial anisotropy.

bright prompt $\gamma$-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is still not
identified. One important observational clue that remains not properly
interpreted so far is the existence of time lags of broad light curve pulses in
different energy bands, named ""spectral lags"". Here we show that the
traditional view invoking the high-latitude emission ""curvature effect"" of a
relativistic jet cannot account for spectral lags. Rather, the observed
spectral lags demand the sweep of a spectral peak across the observing energy
band in a specific manner. The duration of the broad pulses and inferred
typical Lorentz factor of GRBs require that the emission region is in an
optically thin emission region far from the GRB central engine. We construct a
simple physical model invoking synchrotron radiation from a rapidly expanding
outflow. We show that the observed spectral lags appear naturally in our model
light-curves given that (1) the gamma-ray photon spectrum is curved (as
observed), (2) the magnetic field strength in the emitting region decreases
with radius as the region expands in space, and (3) the emission region itself
undergoes rapid bulk acceleration as the prompt $\gamma$-rays are produced.
These requirements are consistent with a Poynting-flux-dominated jet abruptly
dissipating magnetic energy at a large distance from the engine.

that the H{\alpha} flux correlates well with dust- corrected UV star-formation

also find a systematic offset in the SFR_H{\alpha}/SFR_UV ratios for z ~ 4-5

nebular regions and stellar light). We show that we can resolve the modest
tension in the inferred SFRs by assuming bluer intrinsic UV slopes (increasing
the dust correction), a rising star-formation history or assuming a low
metallicity stellar population with a hard ionizing spectrum (increasing the
L_H{\alpha}/SFR ratio). Using H{\alpha} as a SFR indicator, we find a
normalization of the star formation main sequence in good agreement with recent

extension of the convective zones are compared in both theories. The analysis

convective zones, temperature gradients of the ambient and of the convective

reasonably effective at low heights above the disk plane. At higher heights the
inclusion of the radial force becomes increasingly important. We also show that
the method is sensitive to uncertainties in the measured disk parameters,

more accurate measurements of the scale lengths may help reconcile conflicting

increases continuously from zero. We study the effects of thermal and quantum
fluctuations by mapping this structural instability to the six-state clock
model. A prominent implication of this mapping is that at finite temperature,
fluctuations split the buckling instability into two thermal transitions,
accompanied by the appearance of an intermediate critical phase. This phase is
characterized by quasi-long-range order in the spatial tripartite pattern. It
is manifested by broadened Bragg peaks at new wave vectors, whose line-shape
provides a direct measurement of the temperature dependent exponent $\eta(T)$
characteristic of the power-law correlations in the critical phase. A quantum
phase transition is found at the largest value of the critical transverse
frequency: here the critical intermediate phase shrinks to zero. Moreover,
within the ordered phase, we predict a crossover from classical to quantum

clock order. We discuss experimental realizations with trapped ions and
polarized dipolar gases, and propose that within accessible technology, such

launched from the inner region of accretion disks (~30 Schwarzschild radii). A
wide range of black hole masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) and Eddington ratios
($\varepsilon$) was investigated to study conditions for causing the
line-driven winds. For $M_{\rm BH} = 10^6-10^9 M_\odot$ and $\varepsilon =
0.1-0.7$, funnel-shaped disk winds appear, in which dense matter is accelerated
outward with an opening angle of 70-80 deg and with 10% of the light speed. If
we observe the wind along its direction, the velocity, the column density, and
the ionization state are consistent with those of the observed UFOs. As long as
the obscuration by the torus does not affect the observations of X-ray bands,
the UFOs could be statistically observed in about 13-28% of the luminous AGNs,
which is not inconsistent with the observed ratio (~40%). We also found that
the results are insensitive to the X-ray luminosity and the density of the disk
surface. Thus, we can conclude that the UFOs could exist in any luminous AGNs,
such as narrow-line Seyfert 1s (NLS1s) and quasars with $\varepsilon > 0.1$, in

propagating on the Planck-era isotropic cosmological quantum spacetime which
transitions to a classical spacetime in later times. The quantum effects modify
the isotropic spacetime such that effectively it exhibits anisotropies. Thus,
the interplay between this quantum background and modes of the field, when
disregarding the backreactions, gives rise to a theory of a quantum field on an
anisotropic, dressed spacetime. Different solutions are found whose components
depend on the quantum fluctuations of the background geometry. We construct a
formal expression for the power spectrum of the scalar field fluctuations on
such anisotropic background. It is shown that the anisotropy of this power
spectrum is due to the modified frequency of the propagating quantum modes.
This provides a quantitative estimate for the deviations from the isotropic
power spectrum which can lead to the potential observational signatures on the
cosmic microwave background. In addition, the problem of particle production
when transitioning from such an effective spacetime to a classical one is
reexamined. It is shown that particles are created, and the expectation value
of their number operator depends on the quantum geometry fluctuations.

studied as a low-energy theory stemming from the $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory
(GUT). We investigate the possibility of satisfying the minimal $SU(5)$
boundary condition $\mathbf{Y}^d=\mathbf{Y}^{e\,T}$ for the full $3\!\times\!3$
down-quark and lepton Yukawa matrices at the GUT scale within the $R$-parity
conserving MSSM.
  We give numerical evidence in favour of the statement:
  There exist regions in the parameter space of the R-parity conserving MSSM
for which the unification of the down-quark and lepton Yukawa matrices takes
place, while the predicted values of flavour, electroweak and other collider
observables are consistent with experimental constraints.
  Furthermore, we find evidence that the bottom-tau and strange-muon Yukawa
unification is possible with a stable MSSM vacuum in the standard form.
  We investigate two separate scenarios of the soft supersymmetry breaking
terms at the GUT scale. In the first one, it is assumed that the soft terms are
flavour-diagonal in the super-CKM basis. In such a case, the trilinear
Higgs-squark-squark $A$-terms can generate large threshold corrections to
$\mathbf{Y}^d$ at the superpartner decoupling scale. In effect, the condition
$\mathbf{Y}^d=\mathbf{Y}^{e\,T}$ imposed at the GUT scale can be satisfied.
However, the large trilinear terms make the usual Higgs vacuum metastable
(though sufficiently long-lived).
  In the second scenario, we consider non-vanishing flavour off-diagonal
entries in the soft SUSY-breaking mass matrices. We show that a non-trivial
flavour structure of the soft SUSY-breaking sector can allow a precise
bottom-tau and strange-muon Yukawa coupling unification, while satisfying all
phenomenological constraints.

polarization due to short range field non-uniformity caused by the EDL with
consequent particle motion due to interparticle electrostatic interactions acts
as another mode of transport. Coupled electrothermal diffusion arising out of
Brownian randomization in presence of the electric field has been determined as
the third dominant mode. An analytical model based on discrete interactions of
the charged particle fluid domains explains the various behavioral aspects of
such dispersions, as observed and validated from detailed experimental
analysis. The analysis is also predictive of the dominance and behavior of the
three modes with important nanocolloid parameters such as temperature and

class of white dwarfs. In addition to their deficiency of hydrogen and helium,
most of these stars are highly magnetic, and a large fraction vary in
luminosity. This variability has been ascribed to nonradial pulsations, but
increasing data call this explanation into question. We present studies of
short-term variability in seven hot DQ white dwarfs. Three (SDSS J1426+5752,
SDSS J2200-0741, and SDSS J2348-0942) were known to be variable. Their
photometric modulations are coherent over at least two years, and we find no
evidence for variability at frequencies that are not harmonics. We present the
first time-series photometry for three additional hot DQs (SDSS J0236-0734,
SDSS J1402+3818, and SDSS J1615+4543); none are observed to vary, but the
signal-to-noise is low. Finally, we present high speed photometry for SDSS
J0005-1002, known to exhibit a 2.1 d photometric variation; we do not observe
any short-term variability. Monoperiodicity is rare among pulsating white
dwarfs, so we contemplate whether the photometric variability is due to
rotation rather than pulsations; similar hypotheses have been raised by other
researchers. If the variability is due to rotation, then hot DQ white dwarfs as
a class contain many rapid rotators. Given the lack of companions to these
stars, the origin of any fast rotation is unclear -- both massive progenitor
stars and double degenerate merger remnants are possibilities. We end with
suggestions on future work that would best clarify the nature of these rare,
intriguing objects.

Lifshitz scaling. We consider the case of a Lifshitz dynamical exponent $z$
close to unity, where the non-relativistic field theory can be understood as a
specific deformation of the corresponding CFT and, hence, the standard
holographic dictionary can be applied. On the gravity side this amounts to
finding a dynamical bulk solution which interpolates between AdS and Lishitz
spacetimes as time evolves. We show that an asymptotically Lifshitz black hole
is always formed in the final state. This indicates that it is impossible to
reach the vacuum state of the Lifshitz theory from the CFT vacuum as a result
of the proposed quenching mechanism. The nonequilibrium dynamics following the
breaking of the relativistic scaling symmetry is also probed using both local

magnetic braking can provide the observed accretion rates for many progenitor

UnCAL for describing and manipulating graphs. Recently, the functional

an efficient graph transformation language which is useful for various
applications, such as bidirectional computation.
  In order to make UnCAL more flexible and fruitful for further extensions and
applications, in this paper, we give a more conceptual understanding of UnCAL
using categorical semantics. Our general interest of this paper is to clarify
what is the algebra of UnCAL. Thus, we give an equational axiomatisation and
categorical semantics of UnCAL, both of which are new. We show that the
axiomatisation is complete for the original bisimulation semantics of UnCAL.
Moreover, we provide a clean characterisation of the computation mechanism of
UnCAL called ""structural recursion on graphs"" using our categorical semantics.
We show a concrete model of UnCAL given by the lambdaG-calculus, which shows an
interesting connection to lazy functional programming.

Hamming Distance problem ($\mathsf{GHD}^n_{L, U}$): Alice and Bob are given
binary string of length $n$ and they are guaranteed that Hamming distance
between their inputs is either $\le L$ or $\ge U$ for some $L < U$. They have
to output 0, if the first inequality holds, and 1, if the second inequality
holds.
  In this paper we study the communication complexity of $\mathsf{GHD}^n_{L,

protocols. Our first result is a protocol which communicates
$O\left(\left(\frac{s}{U}\right)^\frac{1}{3} \cdot n\log n\right)$ bits and has
one-sided error probability $e^{-s}$ provided $s \ge \frac{(L +
\frac{10}{n})^3}{U^2}$.
  Our second result is about deterministic communication complexity of
$\mathsf{GHD}^n_{0,\, t}$. Surprisingly, it can be computed with logarithmic
precision: $$\mathrm{D}(\mathsf{GHD}^n_{0,\, t}) = n - \log_2 V_2\left(n,
\left\lfloor\frac{t}{2}\right\rfloor\right) + O(\log n),$$ where $V_2(n, r)$

No
computer system has been able to reach human levels of performance so far. The
only known computational system capable of proper language processing is the
human brain. While we gather more and more data about the brain, its
fundamental computational processes still remain obscure. The lack of a sound
computational brain theory also prevents the fundamental understanding of
Natural Language Processing. As always when science lacks a theoretical
foundation, statistical modeling is applied to accommodate as many sampled
real-world data as possible. An unsolved fundamental issue is the actual
representation of language (data) within the brain, denoted as the
Representational Problem. Starting with Jeff Hawkins' Hierarchical Temporal
Memory (HTM) theory, a consistent computational theory of the human cortex, we
have developed a corresponding theory of language data representation: The
Semantic Folding Theory. The process of encoding words, by using a topographic
semantic space as distributional reference frame into a sparse binary
representational vector is called Semantic Folding and is the central topic of
this document. Semantic Folding describes a method of converting language from
its symbolic representation (text) into an explicit, semantically grounded
representation that can be generically processed by Hawkins' HTM networks. As
it turned out, this change in representation, by itself, can solve many complex
NLP problems by applying Boolean operators and a generic similarity function
like the Euclidian Distance. Many practical problems of statistical NLP
systems, like the high cost of computation, the fundamental incongruity of
precision and recall , the complex tuning procedures etc., can be elegantly
overcome by applying Semantic Folding.

levels may be hyperfine or long-lived electronic states. An Ising spin model
governs the Ramsey dynamics, for which we derive an exact solution. Due to the
structure of Rydberg interactions, the dynamics differs significantly from that
in other spin systems. As one example, spin echo can increase the rate at which
coherence decays. The results also apply to bare (undressed) Rydberg states as
a special case, for which we quantitatively reproduce recent ultrafast

routing. However, little work has been done on security aspects of WSN. In a
typical WSN network, the tiny nodes installed on different locations sense the
surrounding environment, send the collected data to their neighbors, which in
turn is forwarded to a sink node. The sink node aggregate the data received
from different sensors and send it to the base station for further processing
and necessary actions. In highly critical sensor networks such as military and
law enforcement agencies networks, the transmission of such aggregated data via
the public network Internet is very sensitive and vulnerable to various attacks
and risks. Therefore, this paper provides a solution for addressing these
security issues based on steganography, where the aggregated data can be
embedded as a secret message inside an innocent-looking cover image. The stego
image containing the embedded data can be then sent to fusion center using
Internet. At the fusion center, the hidden data is extracted from the image,
the required processing is performed and decision is taken accordingly.
Experimentally, the proposed method is evaluated by objective analysis using
peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), normalized cross
correlation (NCC), and structural similarity index metric (SSIM), providing
promising results in terms of security and image quality, thus validating its
superiority.

to apply the inference framework in Loftus et al. (2015) for models determined
by quadratic constraints to the model that minimizes CV test error. Our only

Our dyadic Green's function formulation includes both (1) the electromagnetic

Plasticity-based Rate-Independent Model (APRIM), works for purely elastic

variable (representing interfacial plastic slip) to provide a fracture-mode
sensitivity. It relies on a particular concept of force-driven local solutions
(given by either vanishing-viscosity concept or maximum-dissipation principle).
The other model, referred to as Linear Elastic - (perfectly) Brittle Interface
Model (LEBIM), works visco-elastic bodies and rely on a conventional concept of
weak solution and needs no auxiliary interfacial variable. This model is
directly related to a usual phenomenological model of interface fracture by
Hutchinson and Suo used in engineering. This paper devises a way how the
phenomenology of the LEBIM can be fit to imitate the APRIM under relatively
very slow loading, where both models are essentially rate-independent. The
so-called effective dissipated energy is partitioned in both formulations to
the surface energy and the energy dissipated during the interface debonding
process, where the former is independent and the latter dependent on the
fracture mode mixity. A numerical comparison of these models, implemented in a
Boundary Element Method (BEM) code, is carried out on a suitable

percentage of the open cluster population, and these values are based on a
variety of methods and data. Therefore, a large and homogeneous sample is
highly desirable. In the third part of our series we compile a large sample of
homogenised open cluster metallicities using a wide variety of different
sources. These data and a sample of Cepheids are used to investigate the radial
metallicity gradient, age effects, and to test current models. We used
photometric and spectroscopic data to derive cluster metallicities. The
different sources were checked and tested for possible offsets and
correlations. In total, metallicities for 172 open cluster were derived. We
used the spectroscopic data of 100 objects for a study of the radial
metallicity distribution and the age-metallicity relation. We found a possible
increase of metallicity with age, which, if confirmed, would provide
observational evidence for radial migration. Although a statistical
significance is given, more studies are certainly needed to exclude selection
effects, for example. The comparison of open clusters and Cepheids with recent
Galactic models agrees well in general. However, the models do not reproduce
the flat gradient of the open clusters in the outer disc. Thus, the effect of
radial migration is either underestimated in the models, or an additional

multi-relay multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Y channel, where three user
nodes, each with M antennas, communicate via K geographically separated relay
nodes, each with N antennas. For this model, we establish a general DoF
achievability framework based on linear precoding and post-processing methods.
The framework poses a nonlinear problem with respect to user precoders and
post-processors, as well as relay precoders. To solve this problem, we adopt an
uplink-downlink asymmetric strategy, where the user precoders are designed for
signal alignment and the user post-processors are used for interference
neutralization. With the user precoder and post-processor designs fixed as
such, the original problem then reduces to a problem of relay precoder design.
To address the solvability of the system, we propose a general method for
solving matrix equations. This method is also useful to the DoF analysis of
many other multiway relay networks. Together with the techniques of antenna
disablement and symbol extension, an achievable DoF of the symmetric
multi-relay MIMO Y channel is derived for an arbitrary setup of (K, M, N). We
show that, for K >= 2, the optimal DoF is achieved for M/N in [0,
max{sqrt(3K)/3,1}) and [(3K+sqrt(9K^2-12K))/6,infinity). We also show that the
uplink-downlink asymmetric design proposed in this paper considerably
outperforms the conventional approach based on uplink-downlink symmetry.

area and applied load are shown as a function of the penetration, for loading

roughness leads to a hysteresis loading-unloading loop. This shows that energy
can be lost simply as a consequence of roughness and van der Waals forces, as
in this case a large number of local energy minima exist and the system may be
trapped in metastable states. We numerically quantify the hysteretic loss and
assess the influence of the surface statistical properties and the energy of

that in Sa-Sm galaxies, all core-collapse (CC) and vast majority of SNe Ia

SNe Ia in S0-S0/a galaxies is inconsistent with their distribution in Sa-Sm
hosts, which is probably due to the contribution of the outer bulge SNe Ia in
S0-S0/a galaxies. In Sa-Sbc galaxies, the radial distribution of CC SNe in
barred hosts is inconsistent with that in unbarred ones, while the
distributions of SNe Ia are not significantly different. At the same time, the
radial distributions of both types of SNe in Sc-Sm galaxies are not affected by
bars. We propose that the additional mechanism shaping the distributions of
Type Ia and CC SNe can be explained within the framework of substantial
suppression of massive star formation in the radial range swept by strong bars,
particularly in early-type spirals. The radial distribution of CC SNe in
unbarred Sa-Sbc galaxies is more centrally peaked and inconsistent with that in
unbarred Sc-Sm hosts, while the distribution of SNe Ia in unbarred galaxies is
not affected by host morphology. These results can be explained by the distinct
distributions of massive stars in the discs of early- and late-type spirals.

The goal of agents is to form communities in order to maximize their utility
for obtaining and producing content. We use this model to characterize the
structure of communities that emerge in this setting. While the proposed model
is very simple, the obtained results suggest that it indeed is able to capture
key properties of information communities.

randomly time-varying multi-agent network. Each agent has access to some local
objective function, and it only has unbiased estimates of the gradients of the
smooth component. We develop a dynamic stochastic proximal-gradient consensus
(DySPGC) algorithm, with the following key features: i) it works for both the
static and certain randomly time-varying networks, ii) it allows the agents to
utilize either the exact or stochastic gradient information, iii) it is
convergent with provable rate. In particular, we show that the proposed
algorithm converges to a global optimal solution, with a rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/r)$ [resp. $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{r})$] when the exact (resp.
stochastic) gradient is available, where r is the iteration counter.
  Interestingly, the developed algorithm bridges a number of (seemingly
unrelated) distributed optimization algorithms, such as the EXTRA (Shi et al.
2014), the PG-EXTRA (Shi et al. 2015), the IC/IDC-ADMM (Chang et al. 2014), and
the DLM (Ling et al. 2015) and the classical distributed subgradient method.
Identifying such relationship allows for significant generalization of these
methods. We also discuss one such generalization which accelerates the DySPGC
(hence accelerating EXTRA, PG-EXTRA, IC-ADMM).

forward. Quantum systems scan all possible available states and switch randomly
and very rapidly among them. The longer they remain in a given state, the
larger the probability of the system to be found in that state during a
measurement. A crucial property that we postulate is quantum inertia, that
increases whenever a constituent is added, or the system is perturbed with all
kinds of interactions. Once the quantum inertia $I_q$ reaches a critical value
$I_{cr}$ for an observable, the switching among the different eigenvalues of
that observable stops and the corresponding superposition comes to an end.
Consequently, increasing the mass, temperature, gravitational force, etc. of a
quantum system increases its quantum inertia until the superposition of states
disappears for all the observables and the system transmutes into a classical
one. The process could be reversible: decreasing the size, temperature,
gravitational force, etc. of a classical system one could revert the situation.
Entanglement can only occur between quantum systems, not between a quantum
system and a classical one, because an exact synchronization between the
switchings of the systems involved must be established in the first place and
classical systems do not have any switchings to start with. Future experiments
might determine the critical inertia $I_{cr}$ corresponding to different
observables. In addition, our proposal implies a new radiation mechanism in
strong gravitational fields, giving rise to non-thermal synchrotron emission,
that could contribute to neutron star formation. Superconductivity,
superfluidity, Bose-Einstein condensates, and any other physical phenomena at
very low temperatures must be reanalyzed in the light of this interpretation,
as well as mesoscopic systems in general.

variables to assess whether a risk factor is a cause of a disease outcome.
Increasingly, Mendelian randomization investigations are conducted on the basis
of summarized data, rather than individual-level data. These summarized data
comprise the coefficients and standard errors from univariate regression models
of the risk factor on each genetic variant, and of the outcome on each genetic
variant. A causal estimate can be derived from these associations for each
individual genetic variant, and a combined estimate can be obtained by
inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis of these causal estimates. Various
proposals have been made for how to calculate this inverse-variance weighted
estimate. In this paper, we show that the inverse-variance weighted method as
originally proposed (equivalent to a two-stage least squares or allele score
analysis using individual-level data) can lead to over-rejection of the null,
particularly when there is heterogeneity between the causal estimates from
different genetic variants. Random-effects models should be routinely employed
to allow for this possible heterogeneity. Additionally, over-rejection of the
null is observed when associations with the risk factor and the outcome are
obtained in overlapping participants. The use of weights including second-order
terms from the delta method is recommended in this case.
