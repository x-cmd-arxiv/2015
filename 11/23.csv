assumed to be sufficiently large with respect to the corresponding kinetic

have seen a significant revival in recent years. In this paper we consider a
general framework of local 2k + 1 point schemes containing LeVeque's scheme
(denoted as LTS-Godunov) as a member. A modified equation analysis allows us to
interpret each numerical cell interface coefficient of the framework as a
partial numerical viscosity coefficient.
  We identify the least and most diffusive TVD schemes in this framework. The
most diffusive scheme is the 2k + 1-point Lax-Friedrichs scheme (LTS-LxF). The
least diffusive scheme is the Large Time Step scheme of LeVeque based on Roe
upwinding (LTS-Roe). Herein, we prove a generalization of Harten's lemma: all
partial numerical viscosity coefficients of any local unconditionally TVD
scheme are bounded by the values of the corresponding coefficients of the
LTS-Roe and LTS-LxF schemes.
  We discuss the nature of entropy violations associated with the LTS-Roe
scheme, in particular we extend the notion of transonic rarefactions to the LTS
framework. We provide explicit inequalities relating the numerical viscosities
of LTS-Roe and LTS-Godunov across such generalized transonic rarefactions, and
discuss numerical entropy fixes. Finally, we propose a one-parameter family of
Large Time Step TVD schemes spanning the entire range of the admissible total
numerical viscosity. Extensions to nonlinear systems are obtained through the
Roe linearization. The 1D Burgers equation and the Euler system are used as
numerical illustrations.

matrices and is used in seismology, meteorology, oceanography, neuroscience and
elsewhere. If the number of complex degrees of freedom only slightly exceeds
the dimension of the multivariate stationary time series, spectral matrices are
poorly conditioned and shrinkage techniques suggest themselves. When true
partial coherencies are quite large then for shrinkage estimators of the
diagonal weighting kind it is shown empirically that the minimization of risk
using quadratic loss (QL) leads to oracle partial coherence estimators superior
to those derived by minimizing risk using Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) loss. When true
partial coherencies are small the methods behave similarly. We derive two new
QL estimators for spectral matrices, and new QL and HS estimators for precision
matrices. In addition for the full estimation (non-oracle) case where certain
trace expressions must also be estimated, we examine the behaviour of three
different QL estimators, the precision matrix one seeming particularly robust
and reliable. For the empirical study we carry out exact simulations derived

partial coherencies. This ensures our study covers cases of real-world

molecular emission, we show that as the time-slot duration increases, the input

because many real vortices have similar structure near their centers. We
analyze both cyclonic and anticyclonic cases and show that the stability of the
solution depends only on the ratio of the vorticity to the Coriolis parameter.
Using a very delicate analysis along with computer aided proof, we show that
the stability of solutions can take place only for a narrow range of this
ratio. Our results imply that the rotation of the coordinate frame can
stabilize the compressible vortex. Further, we perform both analytical and

geometry of the Universe is fixed four dimensional Euclidean space and gravity
is a vector field $A_k$ in this space which breaks the Euclidean symmetry.
Direction of $A_k$ gives the time coordinate, while perpendicular directions
are spatial coordinates. Vector gravitational field is coupled to matter
universally and minimally through the equivalent metric $f_{ik}$ which is a
functional of $A_k$. We show that such assumptions yield a unique theory of
gravity, it is free of black holes and, to the best of our knowledge, passes
all available tests. For cosmology our theory predicts the same evolution of
the Universe as general relativity with cosmological constant and zero spatial
curvature. However, the present theory provides explanation of the dark energy
as energy of longitudinal gravitational field induced by the Universe expansion
and yields, with no free parameters, the value of $\Omega _{\Lambda
}=2/3\approx 0.67$ which agrees with the recent Planck result $\Omega _{\Lambda
}=0.686\pm 0.02$. Such striking agreement indicates that gravity has a vector,
rather than tensor, origin. We demonstrate that gravitational wave signals
measured by LIGO are compatible with vector gravity. They are produced by
orbital inspiral of massive neutron stars which can exist in the present
theory. We also quantize gravitational field and show that quantum vector
gravity is equivalent to QED. Vector gravity can be tested by making more
accurate measurement of the time delay of radar signal traveling near the Sun;
by improving accuracy of the light deflection experiments; or by measuring
propagation direction of gravitational waves relative to laser interferometer
arms. Resolving the supermassive object at the center of our Galaxy with VLBA
could provide another test of gravity and also shed light on the nature of dark
matter.

majority of mpDLAs inhabit regions $\ge 20$~kpc from the host galaxy center on
infalling cold gas streams originating from the intergalactic medium, with
infall velocity of $\sim 100$ km/s and temperature of $\sim 10^{4}$ K. For each
host galaxy, on average, about $1\%$ of the area within a radius $150$~kpc is
covered by mpDLAs. The mpDLAs are relatively diffuse ($n_{\rm{gas}} \sim
10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$), Jeans quasi-stable, and have very low star formation rate
($\dot{\Sigma} \le 10^{-4} M_{\odot} \rm{\ yr}^{-1} \rm{\ kpc}^{-2}$). As
mpDLAs migrate inward to the galaxy center, they mix with high metallicity gas
and stellar outflows in the process, removing themselves from the metal-poor
category and rendering the central ($\le 5$ kpc) regions of galaxies devoid of
mpDLAs. Thus, the central regions of the host galaxies are populated by mostly
metal-rich DLAs instead of mpDLAs. All observables of the simulated mpDLAs are
in excellent agreement with observations, except the gas density, which is
about a factor of ten lower than the value inferred observationally. However,
the observationally inferred value is based on simplified assumptions that are
not borne out in the simulations.

dimensional integral that one obtains after localization of supergravity on
AdS_2xS^2. This measure is determined entirely by an anomaly in supersymmetric
Chern-Simons theory on local AdS_3 and takes into account the contribution from
all the supergravity multiplets. In Chern-Simons theory on compact manifolds
this is the anomaly that computes a certain one-loop dependence on the volume
of the manifold. For one-eighth BPS black holes our results are a first
principles derivation of a measure proposed in arXiv:1111.1161, while in the
case of one-quarter BPS black holes our result computes exactly all the
perturbative or area corrections. Moreover, we argue that instantonic
contributions can be incorporated and give evidence by computing the measure
which matches precisely the microscopics. Along with this, we find an unitary
condition that truncates the answer to a finite sum of instantons in perfect
agreement with a microscopic formula. Our results solve a number of puzzles

recognition, many approaches to fine-grained recognition rely on anchoring

discounts pose variation so that features can be tuned to appearance. To this
end previous methods have examined how to find parts and extract
pose-normalized features. These methods have generally separated fine-grained
recognition into stages which first localize parts using hand-engineered and
coarsely-localized proposal features, and then separately learn deep

end-to-end trainable network supervised by keypoint locations and class labels

  Using Abstract Scenes","15 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a model to learn visually grounded word embeddings (vis-w2v) to
capture visual notions of semantic relatedness. While word embeddings trained
using text have been extremely successful, they cannot uncover notions of
semantic relatedness implicit in our visual world. For instance, although
""eats"" and ""stares at"" seem unrelated in text, they share semantics visually.
When people are eating something, they also tend to stare at the food.
Grounding diverse relations like ""eats"" and ""stares at"" into vision remains
challenging, despite recent progress in vision. We note that the visual
grounding of words depends on semantics, and not the literal pixels. We thus
use abstract scenes created from clipart to provide the visual grounding. We
find that the embeddings we learn capture fine-grained, visually grounded
notions of semantic relatedness. We show improvements over text-only word
embeddings (word2vec) on three tasks: common-sense assertion classification,
visual paraphrasing and text-based image retrieval. Our code and datasets are
available online.

and are frequently used in computer science to define search patterns. A
classic algorithm for these problems constructs and simulates a
non-deterministic finite automaton corresponding to the expression, resulting
in an $O(mn)$ running time (where $m$ is the length of the pattern and $n$ is
the length of the text). This running time can be improved slightly (by a
polylogarithmic factor), but no significantly faster solutions are known. At
the same time, much faster algorithms exist for various special cases of
regular expressions, including dictionary matching, wildcard matching, subset
matching, word break problem etc.
  In this paper, we show that the complexity of regular expression matching can
be characterized based on its {\em depth} (when interpreted as a formula). Our
results hold for expressions involving concatenation, OR, Kleene star and
Kleene plus. For regular expressions of depth two (involving any combination of
the above operators), we show the following dichotomy: matching and membership
testing can be solved in near-linear time, except for ""concatenations of
stars"", which cannot be solved in strongly sub-quadratic time assuming the
Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For regular expressions of depth
three the picture is more complex. Nevertheless, we show that all problems can
either be solved in strongly sub-quadratic time, or cannot be solved in
strongly sub-quadratic time assuming SETH.
  An intriguing special case of membership testing involves regular expressions
of the form ""a star of an OR of concatenations"", e.g., $[a|ab|bc]^*$. This
corresponds to the so-called {\em word break} problem, for which a dynamic
programming algorithm with a runtime of (roughly) $O(n\sqrt{m})$ is known. We
show that the latter bound is not tight and improve the runtime to
$O(nm^{0.44\ldots})$.

$S$ such that $f(S)$ is maximized. The \emph{sum-dispersion} function $f(S) =

diversity maximization is the \emph{max-sum} or \emph{sum-sum diversification}.
Many recent results deal with the design of constant-factor approximation
algorithms of diversification problems involving sum-dispersion function under
a matroid constraint. In this paper, we present a PTAS for the max-sum
diversification problem under a matroid constraint for distances
$d(\cdot,\cdot)$ of \emph{negative type}. Distances of negative type are, for

which define and solve an accessory minimum problem (AMP) to design the NOG,
the core of the proposed method is to construct a parameterized family of
neighboring extremals around a nominal one. A geometric analysis on the
projection behavior of the parameterized neighboring extremals shows that it is
impossible to establish the NOG unless not only the typical Jacobi condition
(JC) between switching times but also a transversal condition (TC) at each
switching time is satisfied. According to the theory of field of extremals, the
JC and the TC, once satisfied, are also sufficient to ensure a multi-burn
extremal trajectory to be locally optimal. Then, through deriving the
first-order Taylor expansion of the parameterized neighboring extremals, the
neighboring optimal feedbacks on thrust direction and switching times are
obtained. Finally, to verify the development of this paper, a fixed-time

of Cepheid variable stars in the Galaxy and the Magellanic clouds. The leading
uncertainties involved concern projection factors required to translate
observed radial velocities (RVs) to pulsational velocities and recently
discovered modulated variability. We carried out an unprecedented observational
campaign involving long-baseline interferometry (VLTI/PIONIER) and spectroscopy
(Euler/Coralie) to search for modulated variability in the long-period (P
$\sim$ 35.5 d) Cepheid Carinae. We determine highly precise angular diameters
from squared visibilities and investigate possible differences between two
consecutive maximal diameters, $\Delta_{\rm{max}} \Theta$. We characterize the
modulated variability along the line-of-sight using 360 high-precision RVs.
Here we report tentative evidence for modulated angular variability and confirm
cycle-to-cycle differences of $\ell$ Carinae's RV variability. Two successive
maxima yield $\Delta_{\rm{max}} \Theta$ = 13.1 $\pm$ 0.7 (stat.) {\mu}as for
uniform disk models and 22.5 $\pm$ 1.4 (stat.) {\mu}as (4% of the total angular
variation) for limb-darkened models. By comparing new RVs with 2014 RVs we show
modulation to vary in strength. Barring confirmation, our results suggest the
optical continuum (traced by interferometry) to be differently affected by
modulation than gas motions (traced by spectroscopy). This implies a previously
unknown time-dependence of projection factors, which can vary by 5% between
consecutive cycles of expansion and contraction. Additional interferometric
data are required to confirm modulated angular diameter variations. By
understanding the origin of modulated variability and monitoring its long-term
behavior, we aim to improve the accuracy of BW distances and further the
understanding of stellar pulsations.

cross-correlation function of the EGB taken from the Fermi Large Area Telescope
with the LRGs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Statistical errors are
calculated using a large set of realistic mock LRG catalogs. The amplitude of
the measured cross-correlation is consistent with null detection. Based on an
accurate theoretical model of the distribution of dark matter associated with
LRGs, we exclude dark matter annihilation cross-sections over $\langle \sigma
v\rangle =3\times10^{-25}-10^{-26}\, {\rm cm}^3 \,{\rm s}^{-1}$ for a 10 GeV

the Galactic gamma-ray foreground emission, which we find to be an order of
magnitude smaller than the current statistical uncertainty. We also estimate
the contamination from astrophysical sources in the LRGs by using known scaling
relations between gamma-ray luminosity and star-formation rate, finding them to
be negligibly small. Based on these results, we suggest that LRGs remain ideal
targets for probing dark matter annihilation with future EGB measurement and
galaxy surveys. Increasing the number of LRGs in upcoming galaxy surveys such

angular dependence of the radiation of the accretion disc, and the relation
between the critical angle of torus and the Eddington ratio, there are eight
possible models investigated in our work. We fit the observed CF with these
models to determine the parameters of them. As a result, clumpy torus models
can generally explain the observed correlations of tori, while the smooth
models fail to produce the required CFs. However, there is still significant
scatter even for the best-fitting model, which is the combination of a clumpy
torus illuminated by the anisotropic radiation of accretion disc in an AGN.
Although some of the observed scatter is due to the uncertainties in measuring
$L_{\rm{bol}}$ and $M_{\rm{BH}}$, other factors are required in more realistic

characteristics of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) ferroelectrics exhibiting
a very large piezoelectric response. For nearly two decades, Rayleigh analysis
of dielectric and piezoelectric response at sub-coercive fields has been used
as a phenomenological tool to determine the relative contribution of domain
walls in influencing polar properties in these systems. The high value of the
extrinsic Rayleigh coefficient at the MPB is generally attributed to enhanced
domain mobility. Using coercive field as a measure of hindrance to domain
mobility, in this paper, we have examined the correlation between the extrinsic
Rayleigh coefficient, piezoelectric response, and coercive field (EC) by a
comparative study on three different high performance piezoelectrics (i)
(BaTi0.88Sn0.12)-(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3, (ii) Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 and (iii) PbTiO3-BiScO3
across their respective MPBs. Our study shows that although the three systems
exhibit maximum piezoelectric response and maximum extrinsic Rayleigh
coefficient for their respective MPB compositions, the domain mobility in the
MPB compositions of the Pb-based systems is not the highest. The lead-free
system, on the other hand, exhibits highest domain mobility for the critical
MPB composition. Contrary to the common perception, our study reveals that
large value of the Rayleigh coefficient at the MPB is not necessarily
indicative of enhanced domain mobility. We argue that the large piezoresponse
in MPB systems is a result of complex interplay of field induced motion of the
interphase boundaries and domain walls. In the lead-based systems the
interphase boundary motion hinders domain wall mobility. The large value of the
Rayleigh coefficient and piezoresponse in the Pb-based systems is because of
the dominant role of the interphase boundary motion instead of the enhanced
domain wall mobility.

  Diversity-Inducing Mutual Angular Regularization",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently diversity-inducing regularization methods for latent variable models
(LVMs), which encourage the components in LVMs to be diverse, have been studied
to address several issues involved in latent variable modeling: (1) how to
capture long-tail patterns underlying data; (2) how to reduce model complexity
without sacrificing expressivity; (3) how to improve the interpretability of
learned patterns. While the effectiveness of diversity-inducing regularizers
such as the mutual angular regularizer has been demonstrated empirically, a
rigorous theoretical analysis of them is still missing. In this paper, we aim
to bridge this gap and analyze how the mutual angular regularizer (MAR) affects
the generalization performance of supervised LVMs. We use neural network (NN)
as a model instance to carry out the study and the analysis shows that
increasing the diversity of hidden units in NN would reduce estimation error
and increase approximation error. In addition to theoretical analysis, we also
present empirical study which demonstrates that the MAR can greatly improve the
performance of NN and the empirical observations are in accordance with the
theoretical analysis.

from the robot's prior training environment. For many robotic control tasks,
real world experience is expensive to obtain, but data is easy to collect in
either an instrumented environment or in simulation. We propose a novel domain
adaptation approach for robot perception that adapts visual representations
learned on a large easy-to-obtain source dataset (e.g. synthetic images) to a
target real-world domain, without requiring expensive manual data annotation of
real world data before policy search. Supervised domain adaptation methods
minimize cross-domain differences using pairs of aligned images that contain
the same object or scene in both the source and target domains, thus learning a
domain-invariant representation. However, they require manual alignment of such
image pairs. Fully unsupervised adaptation methods rely on minimizing the
discrepancy between the feature distributions across domains. We propose a
novel, more powerful combination of both distribution and pairwise image
alignment, and remove the requirement for expensive annotation by using weakly
aligned pairs of images in the source and target domains. Focusing on adapting
from simulation to real world data using a PR2 robot, we evaluate our approach
on a manipulation task and show that by using weakly paired images, our method
compensates for domain shift more effectively than previous techniques,
enabling better robot performance in the real world.

electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) comparison of co-deposited tetra- and
intra-molecular G4-DNA reveals variations in morphology and different
sensitivity to the applied electric field, suggesting that the folding
orientation of the strands affects the molecular structure, i.e. either the
tetrad unit or the tetrad-tetrad stacking or both, and therefore the charge
mobility. Tetra-molecular G4-DNA is found to be twice as polarizable as
intra-molecular G4-DNA, suggesting it has greater charge mobility. These
promising results motivated direct electrical transport measurements on
tetra-molecular G4-DNA using a special conductive AFM setup, profiling the
conductance along the molecule. Reproducible currents of tens to over 100 pA
were measured in many tetra-molecular G4-DNA molecules over distances ranging
from tens to over 100 nm. The measured charge transport is compatible with
long-range thermally activated hopping between multi-tetrad segments. To form
the stationary electrical contact, a new variant of stencil lithography was
developed, based on reversible electrostatic clamping, overcoming indeterminate
blurring effects associated with the problem of metal penetration in standard
mask patterning techniques. This method enabled to demonstrate full mask
compliance in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and AFM measurements. The
pull-in instability was demonstrated inside an SEM chamber and was confirmed by
a non-linear transient response computation. New mechanisms were proposed for
the replica formation and the blurring effect based on cluster evaporation and
mobile source decay, explaining the ultimate resolution of the masking

expansion, the on-site Coulomb interaction of Fe $3d$ electrons, and the
antiferromagnetic order in BiFeO$_3$. The injected holes tend to be delocalized
if the on-site Coulomb interaction of O $2p$ is weak (in other words,
$U_\mathrm{O}$ is small). Single center polarons and multi-center polarons are
formed with large and intermediate $U_\mathrm{O}$, respectively. With

hole concentration over 8.7$\times10^{19} cm^{-3}$. The change of the
off-centering is mainly due to the change of the lattice volume. The
understanding of the carrier localization mechanism can help to optimize the
functionality of ferroelectric diodes and the ferroelectric photovoltage
devices, while the understanding of the evolution of the lattice with carriers
can help tuning the ferroelectric properties by the carriers in BiFeO$_3$.

to TTZ at around $\sim$ 39-43 GPa followed by TTZ to HNS-1 at around 80-90 GPa

compression of $a$ and $c$ lattice constants suggest that the ambient phase of
AA transforms to a tetragonal phase and then to a low symmetry structure with
less anisotropy up on further compression. We have noticed that the angle made
by Type-II azides with $c$-axis shows a rapid decrease and reaches a minimum
value at 12 GPa, and thereafter increases up to 50 GPa. Softening of the shear
elastic moduli is suggestive of a mechanical instability of AA under high

the components(in these coordinates) of Killing Vectors, when suitably scaled
by functions, are \emph{zero modes} of the corresponding \emph{scalar}
Laplacian. The complete such set of zero modes(infinitely many) are explicitly
constructed for the two-sphere. They are parametrised by an integer n. For
$n\,\ge\,2$, all the solutions are \emph{irregular} (in the sense that they are
neither well defined everywhere nor are \emph{square-integrable}). The
associated 2-d vectors are also \emph{not normalisable}. The $n=0$ solutions
being constants (these correspond to the zero angular momentum solutions) are
regular and normalizable. Not all of the $n=1$ solutions are regular but the
associated vectors are normalizable. Of course, the action of scalar Laplacian
coordinate independent significance only when acting on scalars. However, our
conclusions have an unambiguous meaning as long as one works in this coordinate
system. As an intermediate step, the covariant Laplacians(vector Laplacians) of
Killing vectors are worked out for four-manifolds in two different ways, both
of which have the novelty of not explicitly needing the connections. It is
further shown that for certain maximally symmetric sub-manifolds(hypersurfaces
of one or more constant comoving coordinates) of the FLRW-spaces also, the
scaled Killing vector components are zero modes of their corresponding scalar
Laplacians. The Killing vectors for the maximally symmetric four-manifolds are
worked out using the elegant embedding formalism originally due to
Schr\""odinger . Some consequences of our results are worked out. Relevance to

would be ruled out by the neutron star (NS) stability. Second, with the
inclusion of the isovector-scalar interaction the symmetry energy exhibits a
general softening at high densities even for the large slope parameter of the

accord with the observations. The NS maximum mass obtained with various

we use the 353 GHz maps from the Planck/HFI instrument to complement the
ground-based APEX/LABOCA observations with information on larger angular
scales. The resulting maps reveal the distribution of cold dust in the inner
Galaxy with a larger spatial dynamic range. We find examples of elongated
structures extending over angular scales of 0.5 degree. Corresponding to >30 pc
structures in projection at a distance of 3 kpc, these dust lanes are very
extended and show large aspect ratios. Furthermore, we assess the fraction of
dense gas ($f_{\rm DG}$), and estimate 2-5% (above A$_{\rm{v}}>$7 mag) on
average in the Galactic plane. PDFs of the column density reveal the typically
observed log-normal distribution for low- and exhibit an excess at high column
densities. As a reference for extragalactic studies, we show the line-of-sight
integrated N-PDF of the inner Galaxy, and derive a contribution of this excess
to the total column density of $\sim2.2$%, above $N_{\rm H_2} =
2.92\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Taking the total flux density, we provide an
independent estimate of the mass of molecular gas in the inner Galaxy of
$\sim1\times10^9\,M_{\odot}$, which is consistent with previous estimates using
CO emission. From the mass and $f_{\rm DG}$ we estimate a Galactic SFR of $\dot
M = 1.3\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. While the distribution of diffuse gas is
homogenous in the inner Galaxy, the CMZ stands out with a higher dense gas
fraction. The low star formation efficiency of the Milky Way is well explained
by the low $f_{\rm DG}$ in the Galactic ISM, while the high $f_{\rm DG}$
towards the CMZ, despite its low star formation activity, suggests that, in
that particular region of our Galaxy, high-density gas is not the bottleneck
for star formation.

large-scale distributed online social networks organized as peer-to-peer

we focus on minimizing the network cost while guaranteeing good search quality.
Our algorithm is based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), which limits the
search to collections of objects, called buckets, that have a high probability
to be similar to the query. More specifically, NearBucket-LSH employs an LSH
extension that searches in near buckets, and improves search quality but also
significantly increases the network cost. We decrease the network cost by
considering the internals of both LSH and the P2P overlay, and harnessing their
properties to our needs. We show that our NearBucket-LSH increases search
quality for a given network cost compared to previous art. In many cases, the
search quality increases by more than 50%.

recently formed, embedded planets. Planet-disk interaction models predict that
planets clear a gap in the gas while trapping dust at larger radii. Other
physical mechanisms could be responsible for cavities as well. Previous
observations have revealed that gas is still present inside these cavities, but
the spatial distribution of this gas remains uncertain. We present high spatial
resolution observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) of 13CO and C18O lines of four well-studied transitional disks. The
observations are used to set constraints on the gas surface density,
specifically cavity size and density drop inside the cavity. The
physical-chemical model DALI is used to analyze the gas images of SR21,
HD135344B, DoAr44 and IRS48. The main parameters of interest are the size,
depth and shape of the gas cavity. CO isotope-selective photodissociation is
included to properly constrain the surface density in the outer disk from C18O
emission. The gas cavities are up to 3 times smaller than those of the dust in
all four disks. Model fits indicate that the surface density inside the gas
cavities decreases by a factor of 100-10000 compared with the surface density
profile derived from the outer disk. A comparison with an analytical model of
gap depths by planet-disk interaction shows that the disk viscosities are
likely low, with a<1E-3 for planet masses <10 MJup. The resolved measurements
of the gas and dust in transition disk cavities support the predictions of
models that describe how planet-disk interactions sculpt gas disk structures
and influence the evolution of dust grains. These observed structures strongly
suggest the presence of giant planetary companions in transition disk cavities,
although at smaller orbital radii than is typically indicated from the dust
cavity radii alone.

scheduler, the goal of synchronization synthesis is to automatically insert
synchronization primitives to ensure that the modified program behaves
correctly, even with a preemptive scheduler. In this work, we focus on the
quality of the synthesized solution: we aim to infer synchronization placements
that not only ensure correctness, but also meet some quantitative objectives
such as optimal program performance on a given computing platform.
  The key step that enables solution optimization is the construction of a set
of global constraints over synchronization placements such that each model of
the constraints set corresponds to a correctness-ensuring synchronization
placement. We extract the global constraints from generalizations of
counterexample traces and the control-flow graph of the program. The global
constraints enable us to choose from among the encoded synchronization
solutions using an objective function. We consider two types of objective
functions: ones that are solely dependent on the program (e.g., minimizing the
size of critical sections) and ones that are also dependent on the computing
platform. For the latter, given a program and a computing platform, we
construct a performance model based on measuring average contention for
critical sections and the average time taken to acquire and release a lock
under a given average contention.
  We empirically evaluated that our approach scales to typical module sizes of
many real world concurrent programs such as device drivers and multithreaded
servers, and that the performance predictions match reality. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach for optimizing the
placement of synthesized synchronization.

In the linear regime, we have developed the gauge dependent formalism to
calculate the quasi-normal modes by gauge fixing, which turns out be
considerably convenient. Furthermore, by giving different Gaussian wave packets
as perturbations at the initial time, we numerically evolve the full nonlinear
system until it arrives at the final equilibrium state. Our results show that
the dynamical stability is consistent with the thermodynamical stability.
Interestingly, the dynamical evolution, as well as the quasi-normal modes,
shows that the relaxation time of this model is generically much longer than
the simplest holographic system. We also find that the late time behavior can
be well captured by the lowest lying quasi-normal modes except for the
non-vanishing order towards the single ordered phase. To our knowledge, this
exception is the first counter example to the general belief that the late time
behavior towards a final stable state can be captured by the lowest lying
quasi-normal modes. In particular, a double relation is found for this

MapReduce, a programming framework for processing large amounts of data using

multiple clouds to adapt to this evolution. The challenge of building a
multi-cloud distributed architecture is substantial. Notwithstanding, the
ability to deal with the new types of faults introduced by such setting, such

Second, it does not require any modification to the widely used Hadoop

offered by MapReduce to tolerate arbitrary faults, cloud outages, and even
malicious faults caused by corrupt cloud insiders. Fourth, it achieves this
increased level of fault tolerance at reasonable cost. We performed an

combining dynamical and structural synchrotron techniques, for the first time
we directly connect previously identified microscopic structural mechanisms
with the peculiar atomic motion, providing a broader unique view of their
complexity. We show that the atomic scale is dominated by the interplay between
two processes: rearrangements releasing residual stresses related to a cascade
mechanism of relaxation, and medium range ordering processes, which do not
affect the local density, likely due to localized relaxations of liquid-like

process sets in, together with a faster medium range ordering, likely
precursors of crystallization.

applications in science and technology. Morpholinium-based ionic liquids

sustainable electrolyte systems for electrochemistry. We investigate local
structures of protic and propton-free morpholinium cations in acetonitrile
(ACN) using semi-empirical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. An impact of an
anion (acetate) on the cation solvation regularities is discussed. Unlike
oxygen, nitrogen of the morpholine ring is a strong electrophilic binding
center. This site is responsible for the interactions of the cation with the
solvent and with the anion. In protic MBILs, the role of nitrogen is delegated
to the proton, which is linked to nitrogen. The acetate anion weakens solvation
of the cation due to occupation of space near nitrogen or proton. The analysis
reveals a favorable solvation of MBILs in ACN, which is a prerequisite for a
new high-performance electrolyte system. The reported structural data are
validated through a point-to-point comparison with the MP2 post-Hartree-Fock

non-ideal-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects including Ohmic resistivity, the
Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion (AD), and the resulting magnetic
diffusivities ($\eta_O, \eta_H$ and $\eta_A$) largely control the disk gas
dynamics. The presence of grains not only strongly reduces disk ionization
fraction, but also modify the scalings of $\eta_H$ and $\eta_A$ with magnetic
field strength. We derive analytically asymptotic expressions of $\eta_H$ and
$\eta_A$ in both strong and weak field limits and show that towards strong
field, $\eta_H$ can change sign (at a threshold field strength $B_{\rm th}$),
mimicking a flip of field polarity, and AD is substantially reduced. Applying
to PPDs, we find that when small $\sim0.1$ ($0.01$)$\mu$m grains are
sufficiently abundant [mass ratio $\sim0.01$ ($10^{-4}$)], $\eta_H$ can change
sign up to $\sim2-3$ scale heights above midplane at modest field strength
(plasma $\beta\sim100$) over a wide range of disk radii. Reduction of AD is
also substantial towards the AD dominated outer disk and may activate the
magneto-rotational instability. We further perform local non-ideal MHD
simulations of the inner disk (within 10 AU) and show that with sufficiently
abundant small grains, magnetic field amplification due to the Hall-shear
instability saturates at very low level near the threshold field strength
$B_{\rm th}$. Together with previous studies, we conclude by discussing the
grain-abundance-dependent phenomenology of PPD gas dynamics.

the purpose of algorithmic development by the existence of the notion of
nearness among the data points. The recent trend of research is on large,
complex networks and their structural analysis, where nodes represent entities
and edges represent any kind of relation between entities. Community detection
in complex network is an important problem of much interest. In general, a
community detection algorithm represents an objective function and captures the
communities by optimizing it to extract the interesting communities for the
user. In this article, we have studied the nearest neighbor search problem in
complex network via the development of a suitable notion of nearness.
Initially, we have studied and analyzed the exact nearest neighbor search using
metric tree on proposed metric space constructed from complex network. After,
the approximate nearest neighbor search problem is studied using locality
sensitive hashing. For evaluation of the proposed nearest neighbor search on

across large poses, ranging from frontal view to profile view. Thirdly,
labelling landmarks in large poses is extremely challenging since the invisible
landmarks have to be guessed. In this paper, we propose a solution to the three
problems in an new alignment framework, called 3D Dense Face Alignment (3DDFA),
in which a dense 3D face model is fitted to the image via convolutional neutral
network (CNN). We also propose a method to synthesize large-scale training
samples in profile views to solve the third problem of data labelling.
Experiments on the challenging AFLW database show that our approach achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

curves of transiting exoplanets or eclipsing binaries, as well as
interferometric measurements of a star or microlensing events is how the
intensity and polarization of a light change from the center to the limb.
Scattering and absorption processes in stellar atmosphere affect both the
center-to limb variation of intensity (CLVI) and polarization (CLVP). In this
paper, we present a study of the CLVI and CLVP in continuum spectra considering
different contributions of scattering and absorption opacity for different
spectral type stars with spherical atmospheres. We solve the polarized
radiative transfer equation in the presence of continuum scattering,
considering spherical stellar model atmospheres. We developed two independent
codes based on Feautrier and short characteristics methods to cross-check our
results. We calculate the CLVI and CLVP in continuum for the Phoenix grid of
spherical stellar model atmospheres for a range of $T_{eff} = 4000 - 7000 \rm
K$, $\log g = 1.0 - 5.5$ and $\lambda = 4000 - 7000 \rm \AA$, which are
tabulated and available at the CDS. For sub-giant and dwarf stars ($\log g =
3.0 - 4.5$), lower $\log g$ and lower $T_{eff}$ of a star lead to higher limb
polarization of the star. For giant and supergiant stars ($\log g = 1.0 -
2.5$), the highest effective temperature yields the largest polarization. By
decreasing of the $T_{eff}$ of a star down to $4500 - 5500 \rm K$ (depending on
$\log g$) the limb polarization decreases and reaches a local minimum. It
increases again down to $T_{eff}$ of $4000 \rm K$. For the most compact dwarf
stars ($\log g = 5.0 - 5.5$) the limb polarization degree shows a maximum for
models with $T_{eff}$ in the range $4200 - 4600 \rm K$ (depending on $\log g$)
and decreases toward higher and lower temperatures.

consistent influence on connection features. This parameter was strongly
associated with the presence or absence of inter-areal connections and when
integrated with spatial distance, the model allowed predicting the existence of

address the problem of estimating an atmospheric turbulence strength profile
and reconstructing the refractive index fluctuations simultaneously, where we
only use wavefront measurements of incoming light from guide stars. Most

as well. We propose two different algorithms for solving the maximum a
posteriori estimate: the first approach is based on alternating minimization
and has the advantage of integrability into existing atmospheric tomography
methods. In the second approach, we formulate a convex non-differentiable
optimization problem, which is solved by an iterative thresholding method. This
approach clearly illustrates the underlying sparsity-enforcing mechanism for
the strength profile. By introducing a tuning/regularization parameter, an
automated model reduction of the layer structure of the atmosphere is achieved.
Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the performance of our method in

  Construction?",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gaussian approximation (GA) is widely used to construct polar codes. However
when the code length is long, the subchannel selection inaccuracy due to the
calculation error of conventional approximate GA (AGA), which uses a
two-segment approximation function, results in a catastrophic performance loss.
In this paper, new principles to design the GA approximation functions for
polar codes are proposed. First, we introduce the concepts of polarization
violation set (PVS) and polarization reversal set (PRS) to explain the
essential reasons that the conventional AGA scheme cannot work well for the
long-length polar code construction. In fact, these two sets will lead to the
rank error of subsequent subchannels, which means the orders of subchannels are
misaligned, which is a severe problem for polar code construction. Second, we
propose a new metric, named cumulative-logarithmic error (CLE), to
quantitatively evaluate the remainder approximation error of AGA in logarithm.
We derive the upper bound of CLE to simplify its calculation. Finally, guided
by PVS, PRS and CLE bound analysis, we propose new construction rules based on
a multi-segment approximation function, which obviously improve the calculation
accuracy of AGA so as to ensure the excellent performance of polar codes
especially for the long code lengths. Numerical and simulation results indicate
that the proposed AGA schemes are critical to construct the high-performance
polar codes.

selected test queries, from which we would ideally like to draw conclusions in
terms of relevance of the results for general (e.g., future, unknown) users. In
practice however, most evaluation scenarios only allow us to conclusively
determine the relevance towards the particular assessor that provided the
judgments. A factor that cannot be ignored when extending conclusions made from
assessors towards users, is the possible disagreement on relevance, assuming
that a single gold truth label does not exist. This paper presents and analyzes
the Predicted Relevance Model (PRM), which allows predicting a particular
result's relevance for a random user, based on an observed assessment and
knowledge on the average disagreement between assessors. With the PRM, existing
evaluation metrics designed to measure binary assessor relevance, can be
transformed into more robust and effectively graded measures that evaluate
relevance towards a random user. It also leads to a principled way of
quantifying multiple graded or categorical relevance levels for use as gains in
established graded relevance measures, such as normalized discounted cumulative
gain (nDCG), which nowadays often use heuristic and data-independent gain
values. Given a set of test topics with graded relevance judgments, the PRM
allows evaluating systems on different scenarios, such as their capability of
retrieving top results, or how well they are able to filter out non-relevant
ones. Its use in actual evaluation scenarios is illustrated on several
information retrieval test collections.

the CH3 radical can be etched by forming a volatile CH4 compound which leaves
the surface, either in the CH4 form or breaking into CH3+H fragments, without
further defect formation. At this energy, adsorption of H atoms on graphene is
possible and further annealing will be required to recover pristine graphene.

understood, and applicable to many fluid flows directly and through its
relationship to multi-mode Rayleigh-Taylor models. This study reproduces three
low-Atwood smRTI experimental runs (Wilkinson and Jacobs, 2007) in a
specialized version of the Nek5000 spectral element code. The simulations use
the initial amplitude, wavelength, acceleration, Atwood number, and viscosity
from the three specific experiments and impose no-slip and no-flux boundaries
on the velocity and scalar, respectively. The simulations are shown to
reproduce the linear, saturation, stagnation, and re-acceleration phases of the
smRTI seen in the experiments. Additionally, access to the full velocity and
scalar fields demonstrates three different finite size effects: wall drag, wall
lift, and a long wavelength mode along the diagonal. One of the simulations is
extended by a factor of two in the vertical direction and the resulting
late-time dynamics reach Froude numbers around 1.8, higher than previously
reported. Finally, inspection of the span-wise flow reveals secondary flows of
the first kind that transport the scalar from the bubble-spike interfaces into
the bubble and spike centers. The agreement between simulations and experiments
inspires confidence in the spectral element method for studying the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

which has proven to be successful at treating multi-electron atomic systems

of developing an ab initio method for solving the Time-dependent Schr\""odinger

time-dependent potential field. The theoretical formulation is developed in
detail for the molecular hydrogen ion where all the multi-electron and
inter-nuclei complications are absent. As in the atomic case, the configuration
space of the electron's coordinates are separated artificially over two
regions; the inner (I) and outer (II) regions. In the region I the
time-dependent wavefunction is expanded on the eigenstate basis corresponding
to the molecule's Hamiltonian augmented by Bloch operators, while in region II
a grid representation is used. We demonstrate the independence of our results
on the introduced artificial boundary-surface by calculating observables that
are directly accessed experimentally and also by showing gauge-dependent
quantities are also invariant with the region I box size. We also compare with

of its [Ca II] lines suggests that the emission originates in its hot, ionized
circumbinary disc. As none of the B[e] stars of lower mass displays [Ca II]
line emission, we conclude that these lines are more likely observable in
massive stars with dense discs, supporting and strengthening the suggestion
that their appearance requires high-density environments.

communication systems, as they allow engineers to perform network simulations
for systems with arbitrary antenna patterns. At millimeter-wave frequencies,
channel measurements are frequently conducted using steerable highgain
directional antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to make up for the
significant increase in free space path loss at these frequencies compared to
traditional cellular systems that operate at lower frequencies. The
omnidirectional antenna pattern, and resulting omnidirectional received power
must therefore be synthesized from many unique pointing angles, where the
transmit and receive antennas are rotated over many different azimuth and
elevation planes. In this paper, the equivalent omnidirectional antenna pattern
and omnidirectional received power are synthesized by summing the received
powers from all measured unique pointing angles obtained at antenna halfpower
beamwidth step increments in the azimuth and elevation planes, and this method
is validated by demonstrating that the synthesized omnidirectional received
power and path loss are independent of antenna beamwidth, through theoretical
analyses and millimeter-wave propagation measurements using antennas with
different beamwidths. The method in this paper is shown to provide accurate
results while enhancing the measurement range substantially through the use of
directional antennas.

study of their transport properties is an active area of research. A well-known
analytic construction is the augmentation of phase space with an additional
time dimension; in this augmented space, the flow becomes autonomous or
time-independent. We prove several results concerning the connections between
the original time-periodic representation and the time-extended representation,
focusing on transport properties. In the deterministic setting, these include
single-period outflows and time-asymptotic escape rates from time-parameterized
families of sets. We also consider stochastic differential equations with
time-periodic advection term. In this stochastic setting one has a
time-periodic generator (the differential operator given by the right-hand-side
of the corresponding time-periodic Fokker-Planck equation). We define in a
natural way an autonomous generator corresponding to the flow on time-extended
phase space. We prove relationships between these two generator representations
and use these to quantify decay rates of observables and to determine
time-periodic families of sets with slow escape rate. Finally, we use the
generator on the time-extended phase space to create efficient numerical
schemes to implement the various theoretical constructions. These ideas build
on the work of Froyland et al (SINUM, 2013), and no expensive time integration

types of waveform distortion are differentiated based on their features.
Similar to other quasi-stationary signals, PQ disturbances can be decomposed
into time-frequency dependent components by using time-frequency or time-scale
transforms, also known as dictionaries. These dictionaries are used in the
feature extraction step in pattern recognition systems. Short-time Fourier,
Wavelets and Stockwell transforms are some of the most common dictionaries used
in the PQ community, aiming to achieve a better signal representation. To the
best of our knowledge, previous works about PQ disturbance classification have
been restricted to the use of one among several available dictionaries. Taking
advantage of the theory behind sparse linear models (SLM), we introduce a
sparse method for PQ representation, starting from overcomplete dictionaries.
In particular, we apply Group Lasso. We employ different types of
time-frequency (or time-scale) dictionaries to characterize the PQ
disturbances, and evaluate their performance under different pattern
recognition algorithms. We show that the SLM reduce the PQ classification
complexity promoting sparse basis selection, and improving the classification
accuracy.

clear differences for rotations rates of 1-16x present Earth sidereal day

using FCOs whenever possible. The latter was recently demonstrated quite
clearly by Hu & Yang 2014 in their aquaworld study with a FCO when compared

positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared
to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have
negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero
like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts
toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the
unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and
PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust
deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and
thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore,
ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while
they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments,
ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better
generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5
layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with
batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks.
ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best
published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or
model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning

the development of particle physics and the Standard Model, we have accumulated
a great deal of knowledge about the relationships among various subatomic

that these relevant variables do not represent properties per se, but rather
the relationship between the observer and the observed. That is, they reflect
details about how the electron influences the observer, and vice versa. Here we
attempt to understand this by considering a simple model where particles
influence one another in a discrete and direct fashion. The resulting

considerably from a normal distribution. To improve the normality of those data
we transform them by the Box-Cox transformation with appropriate parameters.
The Box-Cox transformation parameters are determined so that the transformed
data best show the kurtosis of a normal distribution. It is found that the two
firm size data transformed by the Box-Cox transformation show strong linearity.
This indicates that the number of employees and sale have the similar property
as a firm size indicator. The Box-Cox parameters obtained for the firm size
data are found to be very close to zero. In this case the Box-Cox
transformations are approximately a log-transformation. This suggests that the
firm size data we used are approximately log-normal distributions.

chemical composition of celadon body and glaze in Longquan kiln (at Dayao
County) and Jingdezhen kiln. Forty typical shards in four cultural eras were
selected to investigate the raw materials and firing technology. Random
forests, a relatively new statistical technique, has been adopted to identify
chemical elements that are strongest explanatory variables to classify samples
into defferent cultural eras and kilns. The results indicated that the contents
of Na2O, Fe2O3, TiO2, SiO2 and CaO vary in celadon bodies from Longquan and
Jingdezhen, which implies that local clay was used to manufacture celadon
bodies in Jingdezhen kiln. By comparing the chemical composition in glaze, we
find that the chemical elements and firing technology of Jingdezhen kiln are
very similar to those in Longquan kiln, especially for Ming dynasty. This study
reveals the inheritance between Jingdezhen kiln and Longquan kiln, and explains
the differences between those two kilns.

or have a minimum at negative values of the potential, generically predict a
future collapse of the scale factor to a ""doomsday"" singularity. We show that
this doomsday is generically avoided in models with a proper non-minimal
coupling of the quintessence scalar field to the curvature scalar $R$. For
simplicity we consider linear quintessence potential $V=-s\phi$ and linear
non-minimal coupling $F=1-\lambda \phi$. However our result is generic and is
due to the fact that the non-minimal coupling modifies the effective potential
that determines the dynamics of the scalar field. Thus for each positive value
of the parameter $s$ we find a critical value $\lambda_{crit}(s)$ such that for
$\lambda>\lambda_{crit}(s)$ the negative potential energy does not dominate the
universe and the cosmic doomsday Big Crunch singularity is avoided because the
scalar field eventually rolls up its potential. We find that
$\lambda_{crit}(s)$ increases approximately linearly with $s$. For
$\lambda>\lambda_{crit}(s)$ the potential energy of the scalar field becomes
positive and it eventually dominates while the dark energy equation of state
parameter tends to $w=-1$ leading to a deSitter Universe.

geometric methods and the relation with the singularity theory approach is also
highlighted. The geometric approach is the most straightforward way to obtain a
general picture of the phase-space dynamics of the family as is defined by a
complete subset in the space of control parameters complying with the symmetry
constraint. It is shown how to find an energy-momentum map describing the phase
space structure of each member of the family, a catastrophe map that captures
its global features and formal expressions for action-angle variables. Several
examples, mainly taken from astrodynamics, are used as applications.

scenarios where observations of multi-partite systems cannot be adequately
described by compositions of non-signaling subsystems. In this paper we apply
these frameworks to economics. First we construct a empirical model of choice,
where choices are understood as observable outcomes in a certain sense. An
analysis of contextuality within this framework allows us to characterize which
scenarios allow for the possible construction of an adequate global choice
rule. In essence, we mathematically characterize when it makes sense to
consider the choices of a group as composed of individual choices. We then map
out the logical space of some relevant empirical principles, relating
properties of these contextual choice scenarios to no-signalling theories and
to the weak axiom of revealed preference.

that the empirical distribution of the appropriately normalized roots of the
$n^{th}$ monic Hermite polynomial $H_n$ converges weakly to the semicircle law,
which is also the weak limit of the empirical distribution of appropriately
normalized eigenvalues of a Wigner matrix. In the first proof -- based on the
recursion satisfied by the Hermite polynomials -- we show that the generating
function of the moments of roots of $H_n$ is convergent and it satisfies a
fixed point equation, which is also satisfied by $c(z^2)$, where $c(z)$ is the
generating function of the Catalan numbers $C_k$. In the second proof we
compute the leading and the second leading term of the $k^{th}$ moments (as a
polynomial in $n$) of $H_n$ and show that the first one coincides with
$C_{k/2}$, the $(k/2)^{\rm th}$ Catalan number, where $k$ is even and the
second one is given by $-(2^{2k-1}-\binom{2k-1}{k})$. We also mention the known
result that the expectation of the characteristic polynomial ($p_n$) of a
Wigner random matrix is exactly the Hermite polynomial ($H_n$), i.e.
$Ep_n(x)=H_n(x)$, which suggest the presence of a deep connection between the
Hermite polynomials and Wigner matrices.

modulus of continuity and in terms of a $K$-functional, for the generalized
multivariate Bernstein-Durrmeyer operator $M_{n, \Gamma_{n, x}}$, written in
terms of the Choquet integral with respect to a family of monotone and
submodular set functions, $\Gamma_{n, x}$, on the standard $d$-dimensional
simplex. When $\Gamma_{n, x}$ reduces to two elements, one a Choquet submodular
set function and the other one a Borel measure, for suitable modified
Bernstein-Durrmeyer operators, univariate $L^{p}$-approximations, $p\ge 1$,
with estimates in terms of a $K$-functional are proved. In the particular cases
when $d=1$ and the Choquet integral is taken with respect to some concrete
possibility measures, the pointwise estimate in terms of the modulus of
continuity is detailed. Some simple concrete examples of operators improving
the classical error estimates are presented. Potential applications to
practical methods dealing with data, like learning theory and regression
models, also are mentioned.

then, we apply design procedures relying on the GLRT, the Rao test, and the

algorithm whose convergence and quality guarantee is thoroughly proved. The
performance analysis, both on simulated and on real radar data, confirms the
superiority of the considered architectures over their conventional
counterparts which do not take advantage of the clutter spectral symmetry.
