production in superfluid helium (4He). The PIK reactor is chosen as a
perspective example of the application of this idea, which consists of
installing a 4He UCN source in a beam of thermal or cold neutrons and
surrounding the source with a moderator-reflector, which plays the role of a
source of cold neutrons (CNs) feeding the UCN source. The CN flux in the source
can be several times larger than the incident flux, due to multiple neutron
reflections from the moderator-reflector. We show that such a source at the PIK
reactor would provide an order of magnitude larger density and production rate
than an analogous source at the ILL reactor.
  We estimate parameters of a 4He source with solid methane (CH4) or/and liquid
deuterium (D2) moderator-reflector. We show that such a source with CH4
moderator-reflector at the PIK reactor would provide the UCN density of ~1x10^5
1/cm^3, and the UCN production rate of ~2x10^7 1/s. These values are
respectively 1000 and 20 times larger than those for the most intense UCN user
source. The UCN density in a source with D2 moderator-reflector would reach the
value of ~2x10^5 1/cm^3, and the UCN production rate would be equal ~8x10^7
1/s. Installation of such sources in beams of CNs with equal flux would
slightly increase the density and production rate.

with the energy losses experienced by SPWs during their propagation. To
compensate for the losses, amplifiers have been designed, which are all
extrinsic and need an external agent to supply the energy. Here we
theoretically show that there exists an intrinsic amplification channel for
SPWs in the collision-less limit. We pin down the origin of this channel and

easily seen that $T(H) \ge n!/2^{e(H)}$ as the latter is the expected number of
such copies in a random tournament. For $n$ odd, let $R(H)$ denote the maximum
possible number of labeled copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex regular tournament.
Adler et al. proved that, in fact, for $H=C_n$ the directed Hamilton cycle,
$T(C_n) \ge (e-o(1))n!/2^{n}$ and it was observed by Alon that already $R(C_n)

$P_n$. In other words, for the Hamilton path and cycle, the lower bound derived
from the expectation argument can be improved by a constant factor. In this
paper we significantly extend these results and prove that they hold for a
larger family of orientations $H$ which includes all bounded degree Eulerian
orientations and all bounded degree balanced orientations, as well as many

allows one to control independent collective spin waves within the same cold
atomic ensemble. Generally speaking, there are transverse and longitudinal
degrees of freedom of the memory that one can address by a proper choice of the
pump (control) field spatial pattern. Here we concentrate on the mutual
evolution and transformation of quantum states of the longitudinal modes of
collective spin coherence in the cavity-based memory scheme. We assume that
these modes are coherently controlled by the pump waves of the on--demand
transverse profile, that is, by the superpositions of waves propagating in the
directions, close to orthogonal to the cavity axis. By the write-in, this
allows one to couple a time sequence of the incoming quantized signals to a
given set of superpositions of orthogonal spin waves. By the readout, one can
retrieve quantum states of the collective spin waves that are controllable
superpositions of the initial ones and are on demand coupled to the output
signal sequence. In general case, the memory is able to operate as a
controllable delayed multi-port beamsplitter, capable of transformation of the
delays, the durations and time shapes of signals in the sequence.
  We elaborate the theory of such light--matter interface for the spatially
multivariate cavity-based off--resonant Raman--type quantum memory. Since in
order to speed up the manipulation of complex signals in multivariate memories
it might be of interest to store relatively short light pulses of a given time
shape, we also address some issues of the cavity-based memory operation beyond
the bad cavity limit.

redshift surveys. Exploiting the symmetries of the redshift-space correlation
function, we provide a masked-field generalisation of the Hankel transform
relation between the multipole moments in real and Fourier space. Using this
result, we detail how a likelihood analysis requiring computation for a broad
range of desired $P(k)$ models may be executed $10^3-10^4$ times faster than
with other common approaches, together with significant gains in spectral
resolution. We present a concrete application to the complex angular geometry
of the VIPERS PDR-1 release and discuss the validity of this technique for

parallelized three-dimensional Navier--Stokes flow solver known as TPLS. We
demonstrate how the simplified version can be used as a pedagogical tool for
the study of computational fluid dynamics and parallel computing. TPLS is at
its heart a two-phase flow solver, and uses calls to a range of external
libraries to accelerate its performance. However, in the present context we
narrow the focus of the study to basic hydrodynamics and parallel computing
techniques, and the code is therefore simplified and modified to simulate
pressure-driven single-phase flow in a channel, using only relatively simple
Fortran 90 code with MPI parallelization, but no calls to any other external
libraries. The modified code is analysed in order to both validate its accuracy
and investigate its scalability up to 1000 CPU cores. Simulations are performed
for several benchmark cases in pressure-driven channel flow, including a
turbulent simulation, wherein the turbulence is incorporated via the large-eddy
simulation technique. The work may be of use to advanced undergraduate and
graduate students as an introductory study in computational fluid dynamics,
while also providing insight for those interested in more general aspects of
high-performance computing.

around recombination. As tight-coupling is gradually lost when approaching
$z\simeq 1100$, the velocity difference between photons and baryons starts to
increase, leading to an increasing Compton drag of the photons on the
electrons. The protons are then forced to follow the electrons due to the
electric field created by the charge displacement; the same field, following
Maxwell's laws, eventually induces a magnetic field on cosmological scales.
Since scalar perturbations do not generate any magnetic field as they are
curl-free, one has to resort to second-order perturbation theory to compute the
magnetic field generated by this effect. We reinvestigate this problem
numerically using the powerful second-order Boltzmann code SONG. We show that:
i) all previous studies do not have a high enough angular resolution to reach a
precise and consistent estimation of the magnetic field spectrum; ii) the
magnetic field is generated up to $z\simeq 10$; iii) it is in practice
impossible to compute the magnetic field with a Boltzmann code for scales
smaller than $1\,{\rm Mpc}$. Finally we confirm that for scales of a few ${\rm
Mpc}$, this magnetic field is of order $2\times 10^{-29}{\rm G}$, many orders
of magnitude smaller than what is currently observed on intergalactic scales.

no ribbon structure, introduced first by Kontsevich). The link between the two

roots in the deformation theory of quantum $A_\infty$ algebras and the theory
of Kontsevich compactifications of moduli spaces of curves $\overline{\mathcal

the prop of involutive Lie bialgebras as a subprop we find new algebraic
structures on the classical ribbon graph complex computing $H^\bullet(\mathcal

their enrichment in carbon and the slow neutron-capture (s-process) elements to
mass transfer from a former asymptotic giant-branch (AGB) binary companion. The
most Fe-poor CEMP stars are normally single, exhibit somewhat lower [C/H] than
CEMP-s stars, but show no s-process element enhancement (CEMP-no stars). CNO
abundance determinations offer clues to their formation sites. C, N, Sr, and Ba
abundances (or limits) and 12C/13C ratios where possible are derived for a
sample of 27 faint metal-poor stars for which the X-shooter spectra have
sufficient S/N ratios. These moderate resolution, low S/N (~10-40) spectra
prove sufficient to perform limited chemical tagging and enable assignment of
these stars into the CEMP sub-classes (CEMP-s and CEMP-no). According to the
derived abundances, 17 of our sample stars are CEMP-s and three are CEMP-no,
while the remaining seven are carbon-normal. For four CEMP stars, the
sub-classification remains uncertain, and two of them may be pulsating AGB
stars. The derived stellar abundances trace the formation processes and sites
of our sample stars. The [C/N] abundance ratio is useful to identify stars with
chemical compositions unaffected by internal mixing, and the [Sr/Ba] abundance
ratio allows us to distinguish between CEMP-s stars with AGB progenitors and
the CEMP-no stars. Suggested formation sites for the latter include faint
supernovae with mixing and fallback and/or primordial, rapidly-rotating,
massive stars (spinstars). X-shooter spectra have thus proved to be valuable
tools in the continued search for their origin. Abridged.

$1<p<\infty$), the time discretization by a linear multistep method or
Runge--Kutta method has maximal $\ell^p$-regularity uniformly in the stepsize
if the method is A-stable (and satisfies minor additional conditions). In
particular, the implicit Euler method, the Crank-Nicolson method, the
second-order backward difference formula (BDF), and the Radau IIA and Gauss
Runge--Kutta methods of all orders preserve maximal regularity. The proof uses
Weis' characterization of maximal $L^p$-regularity in terms of $R$-boundedness
of the resolvent, a discrete operator-valued Fourier multiplier theorem by
Blunck, and generating function techniques that have been familiar in the
stability analysis of time discretization methods since the work of Dahlquist.
The A($\alpha$)-stable higher-order BDF methods have maximal
$\ell^p$-regularity under an $R$-boundedness condition in a larger sector. As
an illustration of the use of maximal regularity in the error analysis of
discretized nonlinear parabolic equations, it is shown how error bounds are
obtained without using any growth condition on the nonlinearity or for
nonlinearities having singularities.

total variation is replaced by the more general $E_{\gamma}$ distance. A
general one-shot achievability bound for the precision of such an approximation
is developed. Let $Q_{\sf X|U}$ be a random transformation, $n$ be an integer,
and $E\in(0,+\infty)$. We show that in the asymptotic setting where
$\gamma=\exp(nE)$, a (nonnegative) randomness rate above $\inf_{Q_{\sf U}:
D(Q_{\sf X}\|{{\pi}}_{\sf X})\le E} \{D(Q_{\sf X}\|{{\pi}}_{\sf X})+I(Q_{\sf

${{\pi}}_{\sf X}^{\otimes n}$ using the channel $Q_{\sf X|U}^{\otimes n}$,
where $Q_{\sf U}\to Q_{\sf X|U}\to Q_{\sf X}$, and is also necessary in the
case of finite $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{X}$. In particular, a randomness
rate of $\inf_{Q_{\sf U}}I(Q_{\sf U},Q_{\sf X|U})-E$ is always sufficient. We
also study the convergence of the approximation error under the high
probability criteria in the case of random codebooks. Moreover, by developing
simple bounds relating $E_{\gamma}$ and other distance measures, we are able to
determine the exact linear growth rate of the approximation errors measured in
relative entropy and smooth R\'{e}nyi divergences for a fixed-input randomness
rate. The new resolvability result is then used to derive 1) a one-shot upper
bound on the probability of excess distortion in lossy compression, which is
exponentially tight in the i.i.d.~setting, 2) a one-shot version of the mutual
covering lemma, and 3) a lower bound on the size of the eavesdropper list to

applies not only to all schemes (without any local Noetherian hypothesis), but
also to arbitrary higher stacks on the \'etale site of such schemes, and in
particular to all algebraic stacks. This approach also produces a more refined
invariant, namely a pro-object in the infinity category of spaces, rather than
in the homotopy category. We prove a profinite comparison theorem at this level
of generality, which states that if $\mathcal{X}$ is an arbitrary higher stack
on the \'etale site of affine schemes of finite type over $\mathbb{C},$ then
the \'etale homotopy type of $\mathcal{X}$ agrees with the homotopy type of the
underlying stack $\mathcal{X}_{top}$ on the topological site, after profinite
completion. In particular, if $\mathcal{X}$ is an Artin stack locally of finite
type over $\mathbb{C}$, our definition of the \'etale homotopy type of
$\mathcal{X}$ agrees up to profinite completion with the homotopy type of the
underlying topological stack $\mathcal{X}_{top}$ of $\mathcal{X}$ in the sense
of Noohi. In order to prove our comparison theorem, we provide a modern
reformulation of the theory of local systems and their cohomology using the
language of $\infty$-categories which we believe to be of independent interest.

however, habitability would be accidental and likely brief. In this letter I
propose stabilizing climate feedbacks for such a planet that require only that
biological functions have an optimal temperature and operate less efficiently
at other temperatures. For example, on a planet with a net source of H2 from
its interior, H2-consuming life (such as methanogens) could establish a stable
climate. If a positive perturbation is added to the equilibrium temperature, H2
consumption by life will increase (cooling the planet) until the equilibrium
climate is reestablished. The potential existence of such feedbacks makes
H2-warmed planets more attractive astrobiological targets.

solving large-scale strongly convex quadratic programming (QP). In this paper
we propose some generalized CG (GCG) methods for solving the
$\ell_1$-regularized (possibly not strongly) convex QP that terminate at an
optimal solution in a finite number of iterations. At each iteration, our
methods first identify a face of an orthant and then either perform an exact
line search along the direction of the negative projected minimum-norm
subgradient of the objective function or execute a CG subroutine that conducts
a sequence of CG iterations until a CG iterate crosses the boundary of this
face or an approximate minimizer of over this face or a subface is found. We
determine which type of step should be taken by comparing the magnitude of some
components of the minimum-norm subgradient of the objective function to that of
its rest components. Our analysis on finite convergence of these methods makes
use of an error bound result and some key properties of the aforementioned
exact line search and the CG subroutine. We also show that the proposed methods
are capable of finding an approximate solution of the problem by allowing some
inexactness on the execution of the CG subroutine. The overall arithmetic
operation cost of our GCG methods for finding an $\epsilon$-optimal solution
depends on $\epsilon$ in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$, which is superior to the
accelerated proximal gradient method [2,23] that depends on $\epsilon$ in
$O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$. In addition, our GCG methods can be extended
straightforwardly to solve box-constrained convex QP with finite convergence.
Numerical results demonstrate that our methods are very favorable for solving
ill-conditioned problems.

predictors. It is natural to test for the presence of simultaneous group-wide
signal for groups in isolation, or for multiple groups together. Classical
tests for the presence of such signals rely either on tests for the omission of
the entire block of variables (the classical F-test) or on the creation of an
unsupervised prototype for the group (either a group centroid or first
principal component) and subsequent t-tests on these prototypes.
  In this paper, we propose test statistics that aim for power improvements
over these classical approaches. In particular, we first create group
prototypes, with reference to the response, hopefully improving on the
unsupervised prototypes, and then testing with likelihood ratio statistics
incorporating only these prototypes. We propose a (potentially) novel model,
called the ""prototype model"", which naturally models the two-step
prototype-then-test procedure. Furthermore, we introduce an inferential schema
detailing the unique considerations for different combinations of prototype
formation and univariate/multivariate testing models. The prototype model also
suggests new applications to estimation and prediction.
  Prototype formation often relies on variable selection, which invalidates
classical Gaussian test theory. We use recent advances in selective inference
to account for selection in the prototyping step and retain test validity.
Simulation experiments suggest that our testing procedure enjoys more power

Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) to search for a massive vector
boson, the heavy photon (a.k.a. dark photon, \Aprimebold{}), in the mass range
20-500~MeV/c$^{2}$ and with a weak coupling to ordinary matter. An
\Aprimebold{} can be radiated from an incoming electron as it interacts with a
charged nucleus in the target, accessing a large open parameter space where the
\Aprimebold{} is relatively long-lived, leading to displaced vertices. HPS
searches for these displaced \Aprimebold{} to e$^+$e$^-$ decays using actively
cooled silicon microstrip sensors with fast readout electronics placed
immediately downstream of the target and inside a dipole magnet to instrument a
large acceptance with a relatively small detector. With typical particle
momenta of 0.5-2~GeV/c, the low material budget of 0.7\% $\mathbf{X_0}$ per
tracking layer is key to limiting the dominant multiple scattering uncertainty
and allowing efficient separation of the decay vertex from the prompt QED
trident background processes. Achieving the desired low-mass acceptance
requires placing the edge of the silicon only 0.5~mm from the electron beam.
This results in localized hit rates above 4~MHz/mm$^2$ and radiation levels
above $\mathbf{10^{14}}$ 1~MeV neutron equivalent /cm$^2$ dose. Hit timing at
the ns level is crucial to reject out-of time hits not associated with the
\Aprimebold{} decay products from the almost continuous CEBAF accelerator beam.
To avoid excessive beam-gas interactions the tracking detector is placed inside
the accelerator beam vacuum envelope and is retractable to allow safe operation
in case of beam motion. This contribution will discuss the design, construction
and first performance results from the first data-taking period in the spring

insolation is low enough ($F_* < 2\times10^8\; \text{erg}\; \text{s}^{-1}\;
\text{cm}^{-2}$, or roughly $T_\text{eff} < 1000$) that they are not affected
by the hot Jupiter radius inflation mechanism(s). We compute a set of new
thermal and structural evolution models and use these models in comparison with
properties of the 47 transiting planets (mass, radius, age) to determine their
heavy element masses. A clear correlation emerges between the planetary heavy
element mass $M_z$ and the total planet mass, approximately of the form $M_z
\propto \sqrt{M}$. This finding is consistent with the core accretion model of
planet formation. We also study how stellar metallicity [Fe/H] affects
planetary metal-enrichment and find a weaker correlation than has been
previously reported from studies with smaller sample sizes. We confirm a strong
relationship between the planetary metal-enrichment relative to the parent star
$Z_{\rm planet}/Z_{\rm star}$ and the planetary mass, but see no relation in
$Z_{\rm planet}/Z_{\rm star}$ with planet orbital properties or stellar mass.
The large heavy element masses of many planets ($>50$ $M_{\oplus}$) suggest
significant amounts of heavy elements in H/He envelopes, rather than cores,
such that metal-enriched giant planet atmospheres should be the rule. We also
discuss a model of core-accretion planet formation in a one-dimensional disk

simulated. It was investigated in our previous work since it is in many ways a
prototype metal presenting a close-packed surface here. These hydrogen
molecules are adsorbed at Cu(111) and fixed geometries on the dissociation
reaction pathway for stretched and distant equilibrium H$_2$ are given by using
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations in a plane wave basis. The PBE
wave-functions at these bond-lengths serve as trial input for Quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) simulations of the ground states to obtain highly accurate
correlated results for the associated activation barriers indicating the
catalytic effect on this dissociation. This correlation varies as bonds
dissociate, requiring its accurate evaluation. Finite size effects and
fixed-node error are possible limitations to accuracy of this type of QMC
study. We are able to limit fixed node error, using certain trial
wave-functions. The finite size effect is considerable, although comparing two
adsorbed geometries cancels about 90% with respect to clean surfaces. The

  Proof Construction in Horn Clause Logic","A working draft",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Logic programming (LP) is a programming language based on first-order Horn
clause logic that uses SLD-resolution as a semi-decision procedure. Finite
SLD-computations are inductively sound and complete with respect to least
Herbrand models of logic programs. Dually, the corecursive approach to
SLD-resolution views infinite SLD-computations as successively approximating
infinite terms contained in programs' greatest complete Herbrand models.
State-of-the-art algorithms implementing corecursion in LP are based on loop
detection. However, such algorithms support inference of logical entailment
only for rational terms, and they do not account for the important property of
productivity in infinite SLD-computations. Loop detection thus lags behind
coinductive methods in interactive theorem proving (ITP) and term-rewriting
systems (TRS).
  Structural resolution is a newly proposed alternative to SLD-resolution that
makes it possible to define and semi-decide a notion of productivity
appropriate to LP. In this paper, we prove soundness of structural resolution
relative to Herbrand model semantics for productive inductive, coinductive, and
mixed inductive-coinductive logic programs.
  We introduce two algorithms that support coinductive proof search for
infinite productive terms. One algorithm combines the method of loop detection
with productive structural resolution, thus guaranteeing productivity of
coinductive proofs for infinite rational terms. The other allows to make lazy
sound observations of fragments of infinite irrational productive terms. This
puts coinductive methods in LP on par with productivity-based observational
approaches to coinduction in ITP and TRS.

homomorphisms from a edge $K_2$ into $G$ and study its (topological)
connectivity. This approach dates back to the neighborhood complexes introduced
by Lov\'asz in his proof of the Kneser conjecture. In another direction
Brightwell and Winkler introduced a graph parameter called the warmth
$\zeta(G)$ of a graph $G$, based on asymptotic behavior of $d$-branching walks
in $G$ and inspired by constructions in statistical physics. Both the warmth of
$G$ and the connectivity of $\text{Hom}(K_2,G)$ provide lower bounds on the
chromatic number of $G$.
  Here we seek to relate these two constructions, and in particular we provide
evidence for the conjecture that the warmth of a graph $G$ is always less than
three plus the connectivity of $\text{Hom}(K_2, G)$. We succeed in establishing
a first nontrivial case of the conjecture, by showing that $\zeta(G) \leq 3$ if
$\text{Hom}(K_2,G)$ has an infinite first homology group. We also calculate
warmth for a family of `twisted toroidal' graphs that are important extremal
examples in the context of $\text{Hom}$ complexes. Finally we show that
$\zeta(G) \leq n-1$ if a graph $G$ does not have the complete bipartite graph
$K_{a,b}$ for $a+b=n$. This provides an analogue for a similar result in the
context of $\text{Hom}$ complexes.

the ground states of this classical system may be distinguished by local

topological degeneracy is not a sufficient condition for topological quantum

This is currently the largest published spectroscopic sample of X-ray selected

distribution of optical line widths allowing a separation between broad- and

the relatively bright X-ray flux limit and the optical BOSS magnitude limit. We
classify the narrow emission line objects (22 per cent of full sample) using
standard BPT diagnostics: the majority have line ratios indicating the dominant
source of ionization is the AGN. A small number (8 per cent of full sample)
exhibit the typical narrow line ratios of star-forming galaxies, or only have
absorption lines in their spectra. We term the latter two classes ""elusive''

between the selections, which is a strong function of the imaging depth in a

performed with the Prometheus-Vertex code for 18 pre-supernova models in the
range of 11-28 solar masses, including progenitors recently investigated by
other groups. All models develop explosions, but depending on the progenitor
structure, they can be divided into two classes. With a steep density decline
at the Si/Si-O interface, the arrival of this interface at the shock front
leads to a sudden drop of the mass-accretion rate, triggering a rapid approach
to explosion. With a more gradually decreasing accretion rate, it takes longer
for the neutrino heating to overcome the accretion ram pressure and explosions
set in later. Early explosions are facilitated by high mass-accretion rates
after bounce and correspondingly high neutrino luminosities combined with a
pronounced drop of the accretion rate and ram pressure at the Si/Si-O
interface. Because of rapidly shrinking neutron star radii and receding shock
fronts after the passage through their maxima, our models exhibit short
advection time scales, which favor the efficient growth of the standing
accretion-shock instability. The latter plays a supportive role at least for
the initiation of the re-expansion of the stalled shock before runaway. Taking
into account the effects of turbulent pressure in the gain layer, we derive a
generalized condition for the critical neutrino luminosity that captures the
explosion behavior of all models very well. We validate the robustness of our
findings by testing the influence of stochasticity, numerical resolution, and
approximations in some aspects of the microphysics.

caustic technique. The hydrostatic and caustic masses agree to better than
$\approx20\%$ on average across the radial range covered by both techniques
$(\sim[0.2-1.25]R_{500})$. The mass profiles were measured independently and do
not assume a common functional form. Previous studies suggest that, at
$R_{500}$, the hydrostatic and caustic masses are biased low and high
respectively. We find that the ratio of hydrostatic to caustic mass at
$R_{500}$ is $1.20^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$; thus it is larger than 0.9 at
$\approx3\sigma$ and the combination of under- and over-estimation of the mass
by these two techniques is $\approx10\%$ at most. There is no indication of any
dependence of the mass ratio on the X-ray morphology of the clusters,
indicating that the hydrostatic masses are not strongly systematically affected
by the dynamical state of the clusters. Overall, our results favour a small
value of the so-called hydrostatic bias due to non-thermal pressure sources.

those obtained by previous clustering studies in a UV-magnitude vs. M_h plane,
and allow us to calculate stellar-to-halo mass ratios (SHMRs) of LBGs. By
comparison with the z~0 SHMR, we identify evolution of the SHMR from z~0 to
z~4, and z~4 to z~7 at the >98% confidence levels. The SHMR decreases by a
factor of ~2 from z~0 to 4, and increases by a factor of ~4 from z~4 to 7. We
compare our SHMRs with results of a hydrodynamic simulation and a semi-analytic
model, and find that these theoretical studies do not predict the SHMR increase

and find that the BCE increases with increasing dark matter halo mass. Finally,
we compare our clustering+HOD estimates with results from abundance matching
techniques, and conclude that the M_h estimates of the clustering+HOD analyses
agree with those of the simple abundance matching within a factor of 3, and
that the agreement improves when using more sophisticated abundance matching
techniques that include subhalos, incompleteness, and/or evolution in the star
formation and stellar mass functions.

sources by fitting combined SF and WISE-based torus templates. We also obtained
statistically significant stacks for the undetected sources in two luminosity
groups. The sample properties are compared with those of very luminous AGNs at
z>4.5. The main findings are: 1) The mean and the median SFRs of the detected
sources are 1176 and 1010 Msun/yr, respectively. The mean SFR of the undetected
sources is 148 Msun/yr. The ratio of SFR to BH accretion rate is approximately
80 for the detected sources and less than 10 for the undetected sources. There
is no difference in LAGN and only a very small difference in L(torus) between
detected and undetected sources. 2) The redshift distribution of LSF and LAGN
for the most luminous, redshift 2-7 AGNs are different. The highest LAGN are
found at z=~3. However, LSF of such sources peaks at z=~5. Assuming the objects
in our sample are hosted by the most massive galaxies at those redshifts, we
find many of them are below the main-sequence of SF galaxies at z=2-3.5. 3) The
SEDs of dusty tori at high redshift are similar to those found in low redshift,
low luminosity AGNs. Herschel upper limits put strong constraints on the long
wavelength SED ruling out several earlier suggested torus templates. 4) We find
no evidence for a luminosity dependence of the torus covering factor in sources
with log(LAGN)=44-47.5. This conclusion is based on the highly uncertain and
non-uniformally treated LAGN in many earlier studies. The median covering

several theoretical motivations for existence of a preferred reference frame
(or aether) in a consistent theory of quantum gravity. However, if quantum
gravity had a preferred reference frame, why would high energy processes enjoy
such a high degree of Lorentz symmetry? While this is often considered as an
argument against aether, here I provide three independent arguments for why
perturbative unitarity (or weak coupling) of the Lorentz-violating effective
field theories put stringent constraints on possible observable violations of
Lorentz symmetry at high energies. In particular, the interaction with the
scalar graviton in a consistent low-energy theory of gravity and a (radiatively
and dynamically) stable cosmological framework, leads to these constraints. The
violation (quantified by the relative difference in maximum speed of
propagation) is limited to $\lesssim 10^{-10} E({\rm eV})^{-4}$ (superseding
all current empirical bounds), or the theory will be strongly coupled beyond
meV scale. The latter happens in extended Horava-Lifshitz gravities, as a
result of a previously ignored quantum anomaly. Finally, given that all
cosmologically viable theories with significant Lorentz violation appear to be
strongly coupled beyond meV scale, we conjecture that, similar to color
confinement in QCD, or Vainshetin screening for massive gravity, high energy
theories (that interact with gravity) are shielded from Lorentz violation (at
least, up to the scale where gravity is UV-completed). In contrast, microwave
or radio photons, cosmic background neutrinos, or gravitational waves may
provide more promising candidates for discovery of violations of Lorentz
symmetry.

sine-Gordon model. We find a deviation from the Lorentz invariant dispersion
for the single-soliton resonance. Furthermore, our calculations only confirm
the presence of the strongest boundary bound state previously derived from a
boundary sine-Gordon field theory, while composite boundary-bulk excitations
have too low intensities to be observable. Upon increasing the temperature, we
find a temperature-induced crossover of the soliton and the emergence of new
features, such as interbreather transitions. The latter observation is
confirmed by our ESR experiments on Cu-PM over a wide range of the applied
field.

surface magnetic field. Its topology was previously studied with the Zeeman
Doppler imaging (ZDI) modelling of high-resolution circular polarisation
(Stokes V) observations. Here we assess the robustness of the Stokes V ZDI
reconstruction of the magnetic field geometry of tau Sco and explore the
consequences of using different parameterisations of the surface magnetic maps.
We succeeded in reproducing previously published magnetic field maps of tau Sco
using both general harmonic expansion and a direct, pixel-based representation
of the magnetic field. These maps suggest that the field topology of tau Sco is
comprised of comparable contributions of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic
components. At the same time, we also found that available Stokes V
observations can be successfully fitted employing restricted harmonic
expansions, by either neglecting the toroidal field altogether or linking the
radial and horizontal components of the poloidal field as required by the
widely used potential field extrapolation technique. These alternative
modelling approaches lead to a stronger and topologically more complex surface
field structure. The field distributions recovered with different ZDI options
differ significantly, yielding indistinguishable Stokes V profiles but
different linear polarisation (Stokes Q and U) signatures. Our investigation
underscores the well-known problem of non-uniqueness of the Stokes V ZDI
inversions. For the magnetic stars with properties similar to tau Sco
(relatively complex field, slow rotation) the outcome of magnetic
reconstruction depends sensitively on the adopted field parameterisation.
Stokes Q and U spectropolarimetric observations represent the only way of
breaking the degeneracy of surface magnetic field models.

frequently found near supermassive black holes (SMBHs). As a result,
core-collapse supernovae in these regions should also be expected. In this
paper, we consider the observational consequences of predicting the fate of
supernova remnants (SNRs) in the sphere of influence of quiescent SMBHs. We
present these results in the context of `autarkic' nuclei, a model that
describes quiescent nuclei as steady-state and self-sufficient environments
where the SMBH accretes stellar winds with no appreciable inflow of material
from beyond the sphere of influence. These regions have properties such as gas
density that scale with the mass of the SMBH. Using predictions of the X-ray
lifetimes of SNRs originating in the sphere of influence, we make estimates of
the number of core collapse SNRs present at a given time. With the knowledge of
lifetimes of SNRs and their association with young stars, we predict a number
of core-collapse SNRs that grows from ~1 around Milky Way-like (4.3 x 10^6
Msun) SMBHs to ~100 around the highest mass (10^10 Msun) SMBHs. The presence of
young SNRs will amplify the X-ray emission near quiescent SMBHs, and we show
that the total core-collapse SNR emission has the potential to influence soft
X-ray searches for very low-luminosity SMBHs. Our SNR lifetime estimates also
allow us to predict star formation rates in these regions. Assuming a
steady-state replenishment of massive stars, we estimate a star formation rate
density of 2 x 10^-4 Msun/yr/pc^2 around the Milky Way SMBH, and a similar
value around other SMBHs due to a weak dependence on SMBH mass. This value is
consistent with currently available observations.

found to be significantly faster than the corresponding QM/MM calculations. We
showed that multi-layer perceptrons can successfully reproduce the energies of
QM/MM calculations to a high degree of accuracy with prediction errors

plausible star formation histories of the galaxies by fitting Simple Stellar

stellar component superimposed on an intermediate/old stellar component, to
accurately constrain their star formation histories. We detect prominent young
(~200 Myr) stellar populations in 4 of the 19 galaxies. Of the four, the BCG in
Abell 1835 shows remarkable A-type stellar features indicating a relatively
large population of young stars, which is extremely unusual even amongst star
forming BCGs. We constrain the mass contribution of these young components to
the total stellar mass to be typically between 1% to 3%, but rising to 7% in
Abell 1835. We find that the four of the BCGs with strong evidence for recent

investigate the static and dynamic density response of the nodal line semimetal

line semimetal in the absence of doping is characterized by a ring-shape zero
energy contour in momentum space, which may be considered as a collection of
Dirac points. In the doped case, the Fermi surface has a torus shape and two
independent processes of the momentum transfer contribute to the singular
features of the polarizability even though we only have a single Fermi surface.
In the static limit, there exist two independent singularities in the second
derivative of the static polarizability. This results in the highly anisotropic
Friedel oscillations which show the angle-dependent algebraic power law and the
beat phenomena in the oscillatory electron density near a charged impurity.
Furthermore, the dynamical polarizability has two singular lines along
$\hbar\omega = \gamma p$ and $\hbar\omega = \gamma p \sin\eta$, where $\eta$ is
the angle between the external momentum $\vec{p}$ and the plane where the nodal
ring lies. From the dynamical polarizability, we obtain the plasmon modes in
the doped case, which show anisotropic dispersions and angle-dependent plasma
frequencies. Qualitative differences between the low and high doping regimes
are discussed in light of future experiments.

a barrier that correlates with the SC cohesive energy and can be overcame even

the VX from commonly-believed harmful carrier-traps to electronically benign

chromosphere of sunspot penumbrae, first characterized by Katsukawa et al
(2007) using the \CaII\ H-line filter on {\it Hinode}'s Solar Optical Telescope
(SOT). It was proposed that the PJs form as a result of reconnection between
two magnetic components of penumbra (spines and interspines), and that they
could contribute to the transition region (TR) and coronal heating above
sunspot penumbrae. We propose a modified picture of formation of PJs based on
recent results on internal structure of sunspot penumbral filaments. Using data
of a sunspot from {\it Hinode}/SOT, High Resolution Coronal Imager, and
different passbands of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the {\it
Solar Dynamics Observatory}, we examine whether PJs have signatures in the TR
and corona. We find hardly any discernible signature of normal PJs in any AIA
passbands, except a few of them showing up in the 1600 \AA\ images. However, we
discovered exceptionally stronger jets with similar lifetimes but bigger sizes
(up to 600 km wide) occurring repeatedly in a few locations in the penumbra,
where evidence of patches of opposite polarity fields at the tails of some
penumbral filaments is seen in Stokes-V images. These large tail PJs do display
signatures in the TR. Whether they have any coronal-temperature plasma is
ambiguous. We infer that none of the PJs, including the large tail PJs,
directly heat the corona in ARs significantly, but any penumbral jet might
drive some coronal heating indirectly via generation of Alfv\'en waves and/or
braiding of the coronal field.

The presented model is based on stochastic geometry and accounts for the
intrinsic vulnerability of uplink transmissions. The results show that FD UEs
are not necessarily required to harvest rate gains from FD BSs. In particular,
the results show that adding FD UEs to FD BSs offers a maximum of $5\%$ rate
gain over FD BSs and HD UEs case if multi-user diversity is exploited, which is
a marginal gain compared to the burden required to implement FD transceivers at
the UEs' side. To this end, we shed light on practical scenarios where HD UEs
operation with FD BSs outperforms the operation when both the BSs and UEs are

spectra taken with the Suzaku satellite and measured the Doppler shift of Fe-K
line emission from eight nearby clusters of galaxies with various X-ray
morphologies. In the cores of the Centaurus and Perseus clusters, the gas bulk
velocity does not exceed the sound velocity, which confirms the results of
previous research. For the Cen45 subcluster, we found that the radial velocity
relative to the Centaurus core, <780 km s^-1, is significantly smaller than
that reported in the optical band at the 3.9 sigma level, which suggests an
offset between the gas and galaxy distributions along the line of sight due to
the subcluster merger. In A2199, A2142, A3667, and A133, no significant bulk
motion was detected, indicating an upper limit on the radial velocity of
3000-4000 km s^-1. A sign of large bulk velocity in excess of the instrumental
calibration uncertainty was found near the center of cool-core cluster A2029
and in the subcluster of the merging cluster A2255, suggesting that the
nonthermal pressure support is not negligible in estimating the total
gravitational mass of not only merging clusters but also relaxed clusters as
predicted by numerical simulations. To improve the significance of the
detection, however, a further examination by follow-up observations is

approaches to charge transport through molecular junctions postulate or attempt
to justify microscopically the existence of a dominant molecular orbital (MO).
Within such single level descriptions, experimental current-voltage I-V curves
are sometimes/often analyzed by using analytical formulas expressing the
current as a cubic expansion in terms of the applied voltage V, and relate
possible V-driven shifts of the level energy offset relative to the metallic
Fermi energy \varepsilon_{0} to an asymmetry of molecule-electrode couplings or
to an asymmetric location of the ""center of gravity"" of the MO with respect to
electrodes. In this paper, we present results demonstrating the failure of
these intuitive expectations. For example, we show how typical data processing
based on cubic expansions yields a value of \varepsilon_0 underestimated by a
typical factor of about two. When compared to theoretical results of DFT
approaches, which typically underestimate the HOMO-LUMO gap by a similar
factor, this may create the false impression of ""agreement"" with experiments in
situations where this is actually not the case. Further, such cubic expansions
yield model parameter values dependent on the bias range width employed for
fitting, which is unacceptable physically. Finally, we present an example
demonstrating that, counter-intuitively, the bias-induced change in the energy
of an MO located much closer to an electrode can occur in a direction that is
opposite to the change in the Fermi energy of that electrode. This is contrary
to what one expects based on a ""lever rule"" argument, according to which the MO
""feels"" the local value of the electric potential, which is assumed to vary
linearly across the junction and is closer to the potential of the closer
electrode.

selects a charging station by considering the charging prices, waiting times,
and travel distances. Each charging station optimizes its charging price based
on the prediction of the PEVs' charging station selection decisions and the
other station's pricing decision, in order to maximize its profit. To obtain
insights of such a highly coupled system, we consider a one-dimensional system
with two competing charging stations and Poisson arriving PEVs. We propose a
multi-leader-multi-follower Stackelberg game model, in which the charging
stations (leaders) announce their charging prices in Stage I, and the PEVs
(followers) make their charging station selections in Stage II. We show that
there always exists a unique charging station selection equilibrium in Stage
II, and such equilibrium depends on the charging stations' service capacities
and the price difference between them. We then characterize the sufficient
conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the pricing equilibrium in Stage
I. We also develop a low complexity algorithm that efficiently computes the
pricing equilibrium and the subgame perfect equilibrium of the two-stage
Stackelberg game.

in LDA+DMFT is solved through exact diagonalization and in the Hubbard-I

from LSDA, LSDA+U and LDA+DMFT show the importance of dynamical correlations

the magnetic anisotropy and found that neither LSDA, nor LSDA+U can explain the
measured, high values of the axial and transverse anisotropy parameters.
Instead, the spin excitation energies obtained from our LDA+DMFT approach with
exact diagonalization agree significantly better with experimental data. This
affirms the importance of treating fluctuating magnetic moments through a
realistic many-body treatment when describing this class of nano-magnetic
systems. Moreover, it facilitates insight to the role of the hybridization with

multiplexing (GFDM) and circular filter bank multicarrier (C-FBMC) are two
candidate waveforms that fulfill these requirements. Both GFDM and C-FBMC
operate based on circular convolution, and use cyclic prefix to combat channel

OOB emission and multiuser interference (MUI) in circularly shaped waveforms,
like GFDM and C-FBMC. To stay focused, the study in this paper is limited to
C-FBMC modulation. However, the approach we take is trivially extendable to
other waveforms as well. We derive equations that quantify OOB emission and

This leads us to quantify the methods proposed by other researchers to decrease

Wires (PW), have been previously suggested as novel bio- electronic components.
Until recently, practical examples of electronic circuits using PWs have been
limited. These PWs have been shown to be self repairing, offering significant
advantage over traditional electronic components. This article documents work
performed to produce practical circuits using PWs. Method: We have demonstrated
through manufacture and testing of hybrid circuits that PWs can be used to
produce a variety of practical electronic circuits. A purality of different
applications of PWs have been tested to show the universality of PWs in
analogue and digital electronics. Results: Voltage dividers can be produced
using a pair of PWs in series with an output voltage accurate to within 12%.
PWs can also transmit analogue and digital data with a frequency of up to 19
kHz, which with the addition of a buffer, can drive high current circuits. We
have demonstrated that PWs can last approximately two months, a 4 fold increase
on previous literature. Protoplasmic tubes can be modified with the addition of
conductive or magnetic nano-particles to provide changes in functionality.
Conclusion This work has documented novel macro-scale data transmission through
biological material; it has advanced the field of bio-electronics by providing
a cheap and easy to grow conducting bio-material which may be used in future

elementary field operators, $\Psi (x)$, of the standard model by
$\hat{\Psi}^{j}_{mm'}(x) D^{j}_{mm'}$ where $D^{j}_{mm'}$ is an element of the
$2j + 1$ dimensional representation of the SLq(2) algebra, which is also the
knot algebra. The allowed quantum states $(j,m,m')$ are restricted by the
topological conditions \begin{equation*} (j,m,m') = \frac{1}{2}(N,w,r+o)
\end{equation*} postulated between the states of the quantum knot $(j,m,m')$
and the corresponding classical knot $(N,w,r+o)$ where the $(N,w,r)$ are (the
number of crossings, the writhe, the rotation) of the 2d projection of the
corresponding oriented classical knot. Here $o$ is an odd number that is
required by the difference in parity between $w$ and $r$. There is also the
empirical restriction on the allowed states \begin{equation*}
(j,m,m')=3(t,-t_3,-t_0)_L \end{equation*} that holds at the $j=\frac{3}{2}$
level, connecting quantum trefoils $(\frac{3}{2},m,m')$ with leptons and quarks
$(\frac{1}{2}, -t_3, -t_0)_L$. The so constructed knotted leptons and quarks
turn out to be composed of three $j=\frac{1}{2}$ particles which unexpectedly
agree with the preon models of Harrari and Shupe. The $j=0$ particles, being
electroweak neutral, are dark and plausibly greatly outnumber the quarks and
leptons. The SLq(2) or $(j,m,m')$ measure of charge has a direct physical
interpretation since $2j$ is the total number of preonic charges while $2m$ and
$2m'$ are the numbers of writhe and rotation sources of preonic charge. The
total SLq(2) charge of a particle, measured by writhe and rotation and composed
of preons, sums the signs of the counterclockwise turns $(+1)$ and clockwise

observed in Au+Au (sqrt(sNN)=19.6 GeV) and Cu+Cu (22.4 GeV) collisions at high

bound Helium ($\alpha$), with Lithium, Beryllium, and Boron all clearly seen as
a function of collision centrality and pseudorapidity. We observe that in Cu+Cu
collisions, it becomes much more favorable for the $\alpha$ fragments to be
released than Lithium. The yields of fragments approximately scale with the
number of spectator nucleons, independent of the colliding ion. The shapes of
the pseudorapidity distributions of fragments indicate that the average
deflection of the fragments away from the beam direction increases for more
central collisions. A detailed comparison of the shapes for $\alpha$ and

favors a scaling with the number of participants in the collision.

governed by a second-order differential equation of $A_\phi$ depending on two

the vector potential of the electromagnetic field, $\Omega$ is the angular
velocity of the magnetic field lines and $I$ is the poloidal electric current.
While the two functions $\Omega$ and $I$ are not arbitrarily given, which need
to be self-consistently determined along with the differential equation. Based
on the perturbation approach we proposed in paper I \citep{Pan2015a}, in this
paper, we self-consistently sort out two boundary conditions governing $\Omega$

use of the boundary conditions, we prove that all magnetic field lines crossing
the infinite-redshift surface also penetrate the event horizon. Furthermore, we
argue that the BH Meissner effect does not work in force-free magnetosphere due
to the perfect conductivity.

symmetry about the disk's rotation axis. We interpret this feature as arising
from the fact that the whole separatrix sheets have a unique value of
Bernoulli's constant, and that this constant does not depend on altitude, but
only on the cylindrical radius, in barotropic disks. We next derive an
expression for the torque exerted by the horseshoe region onto the planet, or
horseshoe drag. Potential vorticity is not materially conserved as in
two-dimensional flows, but it obeys a slightly more general conservation law
(Ertel's theorem) which allows to obtain an expression for the horseshoe drag
identical to the expression in a two-dimensional disk. Our results are
illustrated and validated by three-dimensional numerical simulations. The
horseshoe region is found to be slightly more narrow than previously
extrapolated from two-dimensional analyses with a suitable softening length of
the potential. We discuss the implications of our results for the saturation of
the corotation torque, and the possible connection to the flow at the Bondi

the two leading lower-bounds on communication complexity as its natural
relaxations: (external) information complexity ($IC$) and logarithm of
partition complexity ($\text{prt}$), which have so far appeared conceptually
quite different from each other. $IC_\infty$ is an external information
complexity measure based on R\'enyi mutual information of order infinity. In
the definition of $IC_\infty$, relaxing the order of R\'enyi mutual information
from infinity to 1 yields $IC$, while $\log \text{prt}$ is obtained by
replacing protocol transcripts with what we term ""pseudotranscripts,"" which
omits the interactive nature of a protocol, but only requires that the
probability of any transcript given the inputs $x$ and $y$ to the two parties,
factorizes into two terms which depend on $x$ and $y$ separately. Further
understanding $IC_\infty$ might have consequences for important direct-sum
problems in communication complexity, as it lies between communication
complexity and information complexity.
  We also show that applying both the above relaxations simultaneously to
$IC_\infty$ gives a complexity measure that is lower-bounded by the (log of)
relaxed partition complexity, a complexity measure introduced by Kerenidis et
al. (FOCS 2012). We obtain a sharper connection between (external) information
complexity and relaxed partition complexity than Kerenidis et al., using an

immediately ignited efforts to identify the mechanism for the dramatically
enhanced Tc from its bulk value of 7 K. Currently, there are two main views on
the origin of the enhanced Tc; in the first view, the enhancement comes from an
interfacial effect while in the other it is from excess electrons with strong
correlation strength. The issue is controversial and there are evidences that
support each view. Finding the origin of the Tc enhancement could be the key to
achieving even higher Tc and to identifying the microscopic mechanism for the
superconductivity in iron-based materials. Here, we report the observation of
20 K superconductivity in the electron doped surface layer of FeSe. The
electronic state of the surface layer possesses all the key spectroscopic
aspects of the 1ML FeSe on STO. Without any interface effect, the surface layer
state is found to have a moderate Tc of 20 K with a smaller gap opening of 4
meV. Our results clearly show that excess electrons with strong correlation
strength alone cannot induce the maximum Tc, which in turn strongly suggests
need for an interfacial effect to reach the enhanced Tc found in 1ML FeSe/STO.

the onset of instability assumes the liquid to be equipotential and interprets
those configurations as local minimizers of the energy consisting of the sum of

surprisingly, this classical geometric variational model is mathematically
ill-posed irrespectively of the degree to which the liquid is electrified.
Specifically, we demonstrate that an isolated spherical droplet is never a
local minimizer, no matter how small is the total charge on the droplet, since
the energy can always be lowered by a smooth, arbitrarily small distortion of
the droplet's surface. This is in sharp contrast with the experimental
observations that a critical amount of charge is needed in order to destabilize
a spherical droplet. We discuss several possible regularization mechanisms for

restored by the inclusion of the entropic effects resulting in finite screening

unknowns in modern science. Only one example of life exists--one that proceeded
from a single self-replicating organism (or a set of replicating hyper-cycles)
to the vast complexity we see today in Earth's biosphere. We know that emergent
life has the potential to evolve great increases in complexity, but it is
unknown if evolvability is automatic given any self-replicating organism. At
the same time, it is difficult to test such questions in biochemical systems.
Laboratory studies with RNA replicators have had some success with exploring
the capacities of simple self-replicators, but these experiments are still
limited in both capabilities and scope. Here, we use the digital evolution
system Avida to explore the interaction between emergent replicators (rare
randomly-assembled self-replicators) and evolvability. We find that we can
classify fixed-length emergent replicators in Avida into two classes based on
functional analysis. One class is more evolvable in the sense of optimizing
their replication abilities. However, the other class is more evolvable in the
sense of acquiring evolutionary innovations. We tie this trade-off in
evolvability to the structure of the respective classes' replication machinery,
and speculate on the relevance of these results to biochemical replicators.

infer latent skill levels by relating them to individuals' observed responses

measure a latent skill if individuals' responses on them conform to a Guttman

levels span the entire range from most basic to the advanced. In practice,
education researchers manually devise items (quiz questions) while optimising
well-scaled conformance. Due to the costly nature and expert requirements of
this process, psychometric testing has found limited use in everyday teaching.
We aim to develop usable measurement models for highly-instrumented MOOC

orbiting jet source model that includes a position shift due to proper motion
of the jet, indicating that the wiggle propagates along the jet axis. Thus,
this suggests the wiggle is indeed due to an orbital motion of the jet source.
Proper motions of the knots are measured by using the peak positions of the
knots in four epochs, and they are roughly the same and independent of the
distance from the central source. The mean proper motion of the knots is $\sim$
0.087 arcsec per year, resulting in a transverse velocity of $\sim$ 114 km
s$^{-1}$, about 30\% lower than that measured before. Knots BK2 and BK3 have a
well-defined linear velocity structure, with the fast jet material upstream to
the slow jet material. The gradient of the velocity structure decreases from
knot BK2 to BK3. In addition, for each knot, the gradient decreases with time,
as the knot propagates away from the central source. These results are both
expected if the two knots trace internal shocks produced by a small periodical
variation in ejection velocity of the jet.

1-3 keV, and optical thickness ~10) corona. The fit results can be
characterized by two new parameters. One is Q (defined as the electron
temerature divided by the inner radius temperature) which describes balance
between the Compton cooling and gravitational heating of the coronal electrons,
while the other is F, namely, the covering fraction of the MCD by the corona.
Here, F is calculated from the percentage of the directly-visible disk
luminosity in the total radiation. Then, the PL-state spectra have been found

the two states are clearly separated in terms of Q and F. The obtained results

impact on public health.
  We show that flux strength is independent of EC50 and sweet potency. Sweet
potency-EC50 relation is non-linear and anti-correlated. Single point mutants
affecting receptor efficiency, without significant shift in EC50 have been
published, indicating flux strength is independent of ligand binding. G-protein
coupling step is likely observed in the assay. Thus, years have been spent
generating uncorrelated data. Data from uncorrelated observables does not give
meaningful results. Still, majority of research in the field, uses change in
calcium flux strength to study the receptor. Methodology away from flux
strength monitor is required for sweetener development, reestablish binding
localization of sweeteners established by flux strength method. This article

Dark Matter (DM) dominated objects from the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies to
clusters of galaxies that span the mass range from $10^{6} M_{\odot}$ to
$10^{15} M_{\odot}$. To analyze data of this divers collection of objects we
used a simple toy model of spherical DM halo formation that was initially
proposed by Peebles. This model introduced the concept of the epoch or redshift
of halo formation. Using this concept we analyzed selected sample of DM
dominated objects and we have found empirical correlations between the virial
mass, $M_{vir}$, of halos and basic parameters of their cores, namely, the mean
DM density, pressure and entropy. These correlations are a natural result of
similar evolution of all such objects. It is driven mainly by gravitational
interactions what implies a high degree of self similarity of both the process
of halos formation and their internal structure.
  We confirmed the CDM--like shape of both the small and large scale power
spectrum. However, our reconstruction of the evolutionary history of observed
objects differs from expectations of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and
requires either a multicomponent composition of DM or a more complex primordial
power spectrum of density perturbations with significant excess of power at
scales of clusters of galaxies and larger. We demonstrated that a model with
suitable combination of the heavy DM particles (CDM) and DM particles with
large damping scale (HDM) could provide a successful description of the
observational data in a wide range of masses.

  Our second result concerns the continuity of spectral shift functions
$\xi(\cdot; B,B_0)$ with respect to the operator parameter $B$. For $T$
self-adjoint in $\mathcal{H}$ we denote by $\Gamma_m(T)$, $m \in \mathbb{N}$
odd, the set of all self-adjoint operators $S$ in $\mathcal{H}$ satisfying
$\big[(S - z I_{\mathcal{H}})^{-m} - (T - z I_{\mathcal{H}})^{-m}\big] \in
\mathcal{B}_1(\mathcal{H})$, $z \in \mathbb{C}\backslash \mathbb{R}$. Employing
a suitable topology on $\Gamma_m(T)$ (cf. (1.9), we prove the following:
Suppose that $B_1\in \Gamma_m(B_0)$ and let $\{B_{\tau}\}_{\tau\in
[0,1]}\subset \Gamma_m(B_0)$ denote a path from $B_0$ to $B_1$ in
$\Gamma_m(B_0)$ depending continuously on $\tau\in [0,1]$ with respect to the
topology on $\Gamma_m(B_0)$. If $f \in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$, then $$
\lim_{\tau\to 0^+} \|\xi(\, \cdot \, ; B_{\tau}, A_0) f - \xi(\, \cdot \, ;
B_0, A_0) f\|_{L^1(\mathbb{R}; (|\nu|^{m+1} + 1)^{-1}d\nu)} = 0. $$

  It is found that irrespective of their morphological types, $red$ and $blue$
sources occupy environments with more or less similar densities (i.e., the
$\Sigma_5$ parameter). From the analysis of the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of galaxies in our samples based on MAGPHYS, we find that galaxies in
the $red$ sample (of any morphological type) have dust masses similar to those
in the $blue$ sample (i.e. normal spiral/star-forming systems). However, in
comparison to the $red$-spirals and in particular $blue$ systems,
$red$-ellipticals have lower mean dust-to-stellar mass ratios. Besides galaxies
in the $red$-elliptical sample have much lower mean
star-formation/specific-star-formation rates in contrast to their counterparts
in the $blue$ sample. Our results support a scenario where dust in early-type
systems is likely to be of an external origin.

estimators robust to outliers and heavy-tailed errors, they are not robust

method combining MM and bridge regression estimation methods. The MM bridge
regression estimator obtained from the proposed method is robust against
outliers and leverage points. Furthermore, for appropriate choices of the
penalty function, the proposed method is able to perform variable selection and
parameter estimation simultaneously. Consistency, asymptotic normality, and
sparsity of the MM bridge regression estimator are achieved. We propose an

a real data example are provided to demonstrate the performance of the MM

particles is affected by inertial forces originating from the curvature of the
embedding space. Here we reveal a fundamental process underlying fluid dynamics
in curved space: the free motion of fluids, in the complete absence of solid
walls or obstacles, exhibits loss of energy due exclusively to the intrinsic
curvature of space. We find that local sources of curvature generate viscous
stresses as a result of the inertial forces. The curvature-induced viscous
forces are shown to cause hitherto unnoticed and yet appreciable energy
dissipation, which might play a significant role for a variety of physical

first uncertainties are statistical, the second are systematic, the third are
due to the knowledge of the LHC beam energy and the fourth are due to the

with centre-of-mass energy is studied using previously reported measurements
with $1.0\mathrm{\,fb}^{-1}$ of data at $7\mathrm{\,Te\kern -0.1em V}$.
Differential distributions are also presented. Results are in good agreement
with theoretical predictions at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative
quantum chromodynamics.

extended Krylov subspace methods, a class of iterative methods which do not
fall into this category are also proposed in this paper. Comparing with
traditional Krylov subspace methods which always depend on the matrix-vector
multiplication with a fixed matrix, the newly introduced methods(the so-called
(progressively) accumulated projection methods, or AP (PAP) for short) use a
projection matrix which varies in every iteration to form a subspace from which
an approximate solution is sought. More importantly an accelerative
approach(called APAP) is introduced to improve the convergence of PAP method.
Numerical experiments demonstrate some surprisingly improved convergence
behavior. Comparison between benchmark extended Krylov subspace methods(Block
Jacobi and GMRES) are made and one can also see remarkable advantage of APAP in
some examples. APAP is also used to solve systems with extremely
ill-conditioned coefficient matrix (the Hilbert matrix) and numerical
experiments shows that it can bring very satisfactory results even when the
size of system is up to a few thousands.

nanostructure consisting of a semiconducting nanowire covered by a

interaction in these devices. Our main result is that Coulomb interaction
causes the chemical potential to respond to an applied magnetic field, while
spin-orbit interaction and screening by the superconducting lead suppress this
response. Consequently, the electrostatic environment influences two properties
of Majorana devices: the shape of the topological phase boundary and the
oscillations of the Majorana splitting energy. We demonstrate that both
properties show a non-universal behavior, and depend on the details of the
electrostatic environment. We show that when the wire only contains a single
electron mode, the experimentally accessible inverse self-capacitance of this
mode fully captures the interplay between electrostatics and Zeeman field. This
offers a way to compare theoretical predictions with experiments.

achieved by homogeneously incorporating Si atoms in single quantum wells of
high quality GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. Several materials were grown this
way with different densities of Si atoms. At low temperature the mobility
decreases monotonically with increasing impurity density. In materials with
incorporated impurities, effects are observed with increasing temperatures. On
the one hand, a minimum in mobility appears, marking a transition between
scattering enhancement due to acoustic phonon and mobility enhancement due to
impurity driven conductivity. The temperature at which the transition takes
place decreases with increasing impurity density. On the other hand, the
incorporated impurities induce a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the
electron density. The magnitude of this variation rises with increasing
impurity density. The theory of electron-electron interaction correction to the
conductivity alone fails to explain our results.

aligned with the way domain experts reason about a software component. The
development of DSLs is usually centered around a grammar and transformations
that generate implementation code or analysis models. The semantics of the
language is often defined implicitly and in terms of a transformation to
implementation code. In the presence of multiple transformations from the DSL,
the consistency of the generated artifacts with respect to the semantics of the
DSL is a relevant issue. We show that a formal semantics is essential for
checking the consistency between the generated artifacts. We exploit the formal
semantics in an industrial project and use formal techniques based on
equivalence checking and model-based testing for consistency checking. We
report about our experience with this approach in an industrial development

Milton and Nicorovici in \cite{MiltonNicorovici}. A general setting in which
cloaking a source via ALR takes place is the settting of doubly complementary
media. This was introduced and studied in \cite{Ng-CALR} for the quasistatic
regime. In this paper, we study cloaking a source via ALR for doubly
complementary media in the finite frequency regime as a natural continuation of
\cite{Ng-CALR}. We establish the following results: 1) Cloaking a source via
ALR appears if and only if the power blows up; 2) The power blows up if the
source is ``placed"" near the plasmonic structure; 3) The power remains bounded
if the source is far away from the plasmonic structure. Concerning the
analysis, we extend ideas from \cite{Ng-CALR} and add new insights on the
problem which allows us to overcome difficulties related to the finite
frequency regime and to obtain new information on the problem. In particular,
we are able to characterize the behaviour of the fields far enough from the
plasmonic shell as the loss goes to 0 for an {\bf arbitrary source} outside the
core-shell structure in the doubly complementary media setting.

ability to represent complex non-treelike evolutionary events such as
recombination or hybridization. Popular combinatorial objects used to construct
them are triplet systems and cluster systems, the motivation being that any
network $N$ induces a triplet system $\mathcal R(N)$ and a softwired cluster
system $\mathcal S(N)$. Since in real-world studies it cannot be guaranteed
that all triplets/softwired clusters induced by a network are available it is
of particular interest to understand whether subsets of $\mathcal R(N)$ or
$\mathcal S(N)$ allow one to uniquely reconstruct the underlying network $N$.
Here we show that even within the highly restricted yet biologically
interesting space of level-1 phylogenetic networks it is not always possible to
uniquely reconstruct a level-1 network $N$ even when all triplets in $\mathcal
R(N)$ or all clusters in $\mathcal S(N)$ are available. On the positive side,
we introduce a reasonably large subclass of level-1 networks the members of
which are uniquely determined by their induced triplet/softwired cluster
systems. Along the way, we also establish various enumerative results, both
positive and negative, including results which show that certain special
subclasses of level-1 networks $N$ can be uniquely reconstructed from proper
subsets of $\mathcal R(N)$ and $\mathcal S(N)$. We anticipate these results to
be of use in the design of, for example, algorithms for phylogenetic network
inference.

effective and efficient pedestrian detection. However, most state-of-the-art

Inspired by some simple inherent attributes of pedestrians (i.e., appearance
constancy and shape symmetry), we propose two new types of non-neighboring
features (NNF): side-inner difference features (SIDF) and symmetrical
similarity features (SSF). SIDF can characterize the difference between the
background and pedestrian and the difference between the pedestrian contour and
its inner part. SSF can capture the symmetrical similarity of pedestrian shape.
However, it's difficult for neighboring features to have such above
characterization abilities. Finally, we propose to combine both non-neighboring
and neighboring features for pedestrian detection. It's found that
non-neighboring features can further decrease the average miss rate by 4.44%.
Experimental results on INRIA and Caltech pedestrian datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Compared to the
state-of-the-art methods without using CNN, our method achieves the best
detection performance on Caltech, outperforming the second best method (i.e.,
Checkboards) by 1.63%.

approximating the smooth component of the objective function. We apply our

velocity-vorticity discretization of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. The scheme
begins with a formulation that uses the Lamb vector to couple the usual
velocity-pressure system to the vorticity dynamics equation, and then
discretizes with the finite element method in space and implicit-explicit BDF2
in time, with the vorticity equation decoupling at each time step. We prove the
method's vorticity and velocity are both long-time stable in the $L^2$ and
$H^1$ norms, without any timestep restriction. Moreover, our analysis avoids
the use of Gronwall-type estimates, which leads us to stability bounds with
only polynomial (instead of exponential) dependence on the Reynolds number.
Numerical experiments are given that demonstrate the effectiveness of the

We finally provide a multiple testing procedure which can be geared
specifically to the types of multiple regulators of interest, and we establish
that, under standard regularity conditions, the familywise error rate will
approach 0 as sample size diverges. Simulation results indicate that our
approach can improve over unregularized methods both in reducing bias in

is employed to value the client's quality of experience across various possible

proposed scheme is that the complexity of the optimization is independent of
the number of clients. Additionally, a convex formulation is proposed that
attains close to the best performance and offers a reliable alternative when
further reduction in computational complexity is desired. The optimization is
extended to perform suppression of QoE fluctuations for clients with marginal
channel qualities. The scheme offers a means to trade-off service utility for
the entire multicast group and clients with the worst channels. According to

detect clear anisotropy due to redshift-space distortions (RSD) both in the
correlation function as a function of separations parallel and perpendicular to
the line of sight and its quadrupole moment. RSD has been extensively used to
test general relativity on cosmological scales at $z<1$. Adopting a LCDM
cosmology with the fixed expansion history and no velocity dispersion
$\sigma_{\rm v}=0$, and using the RSD measurements on scales above 8Mpc/h, we
obtain the first constraint on the growth rate at the redshift,
$f(z)\sigma_8(z)=0.482\pm 0.116$ at $z\sim 1.4$ after marginalizing over the
galaxy bias parameter $b(z)\sigma_8(z)$. This corresponds to $4.2\sigma$
detection of RSD. Our constraint is consistent with the prediction of general
relativity $f\sigma_8\sim 0.392$ within the $1-\sigma$ confidence level. When
we allow $\sigma_{\rm v}$ to vary and marginalize it over, the growth rate
constraint becomes $f\sigma_8=0.494^{+0.126}_{-0.120}$. We also demonstrate
that by combining with the low-z constraints on $f\sigma_8$, high-z galaxy
surveys like the FastSound can be useful to distinguish modified gravity models
without relying on CMB anisotropy experiments.

time-invariant elevation component and a time-varying azimuth component, by
means of a layered precoding approach, so as to reduce the fronthaul overhead.
According to this scheme, separate precoding matrices are applied for the
azimuth and elevation channel components, with different rates of adaptation to
the channel variations and correspondingly different impacts on the fronthaul
capacity. Moreover, we consider two different Central Unit (CU) - Radio Unit
(RU) functional splits at the physical layer, namely the conventional C-RAN
implementation and an alternative one in which coding and precoding are
performed at the RUs. Via numerical results, it is shown that the layered
schemes significantly outperform conventional non-layered schemes, especially

is a new test of MOND, different from rotation-curve analysis. A nontrivial
accomplishment of MOND -- not discussed by Angus et al. -- is that the shapes
of $\sigma_M$ and $\sigma$ agree very well, i.e,
$\eta(r)\equiv\sigma_M(r)/\sigma(r)$ is well consistent with being
$r$-independent (while $\sigma$ and $\sigma_M$ are strongly $r$ dependent). The
fault found with MOND was that $\eta$ is systematically above 1 (with an
average of about 1.3). I have suggested to Angus et al. that the fault may lie
with the DiskMass dispersions, which may well be too low for the purpose at
hand: Being based on population-integrated line profiles, they may be
overweighed by younger populations, known to have much smaller dispersions, and
scale heights, than the older populations, which weigh more heavily on the
light distributions. I discuss independent evidence that supports this view,
and show, besides, that if the DiskMas dispersions are underestimates by only
25 %, on average, the MOND predictions are in full agreement with the data, in
shape and magnitude. Now, Aniyan et al. (2015) have questioned the DiskMass
$\sigma$ on the same basis. They show for the solar column in the Milky Way
that: "" Combining the (single) measured velocity dispersion of the total young
+ old disc population... with the scale height estimated for the older
population would underestimate the disc surface density by a factor of $\sim
2.$"" If this mismatch found for the Milky Way is typical, correcting for it
would bring the measured DiskMass $\sigma(r)$ to a remarkable agreement with
the predicted MOND $\sigma_M(r)$.

systematic study of those matrix product operators, and show how this relates
entanglement properties of projected entangled-pair states to the formalism of

acting purely on the virtual level of the tensor network, the ensuing Wilson
loops are not fattened when perturbing the system, and this opens up the
possibility of simulating topological theories away from renormalization group
fixed points. We illustrate the general formalism for the special cases of

consistently in such a scenario for a time-dependent Dyson map and

the cost of rendering the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to be a non-observable

efficient Monte Carlo sampling schemes (MC dynamics, MC replica-exchange, and

force-field, which is largely defined using one-dimensional structural
properties of proteins, including protein secondary structure. This chapter

the velocity to be delta-correlated in time. We generalize this model to
include the effects of a finite correlation time, $\tau$, using renewing flows.
The resulting equation for the 3-D passive scalar spectrum $\hat{M}(k,t)$ or
its correlation function $M(r,t)$, gives the Kraichnan equation when $\tau \to
0$, and extends it to the next order in $\tau$. It involves third and fourth
order derivatives of $M$ or $\hat{M}$ (in the high $k$ limit). For
small-$\tau$, it can be recast using the Landau-Lifshitz approach, to one with
at most second derivatives of $\hat{M}$. We present both a scaling solution to
this equation neglecting diffusion and a more exact solution including
diffusive effects. We show that the steady state 1-D passive scalar spectrum,
preserves the Batchelor form, $E_\theta(k) \propto k^{-1}$, in the
viscous-convective limit, independent of $\tau$. This result can also be
obtained in a general manner using Lagrangian methods. Interestingly, in the
absence of sources, when passive scalar fluctuations decay, we show that the
spectrum in the Batchelor regime and at late times, is of the form $E_\theta(k)
\propto k^{1/2}$ and also independent of $\tau$. More generally, finite $\tau$
does not qualitatively change the shape of the spectrum during decay, although
the decay rate is reduced. From high resolution ($1024^3$) direct numerical
simulations of passive scalar mixing and decay, We find reasonable agreement
with predictions of the Batchelor spectrum, during steady state. The scalar
spectrum during decay agrees qualitatively with analytic predictions when power
is dominantly in wavenumbers corresponding to the Batchelor regime, but is
however shallower when box scale fluctuations dominate during decay (abridged).

toward Planck Galactic cold clumps (PGCCs) in the $\lambda$ Orionis complex in
order to systematically investigate the effects of stellar feedback. In the
particular case of PGCC G192.32-11.88, we discovered an extremely young Class 0
protostellar object (G192N) and a proto-brown dwarf candidate (G192S). G192N
and G192S are located in a gravitationally bound bright-rimmed clump. The
velocity and temperature gradients seen in line emission of CO isotopologues
indicate that PGCC G192.32-11.88 is externally heated and compressed. G192N
probably has the lowest bolometric luminosity ($\sim0.8$ L$_{\sun}$) and
accretion rate (6.3$\times10^{-7}$ M$_{\sun}$~yr$^{-1}$) when compared with
other young Class 0 sources (e.g. PACS Bright Red sources (PBRs)) in the Orion
complex. It has slightly larger internal luminosity ($0.21\pm0.01$ L$_{\sun}$)
and outflow velocity ($\sim$14 km~s$^{-1}$) than the predictions of first
hydrostatic cores (FHSCs). G192N might be among the youngest Class 0 sources,
which are slightly more evolved than a FHSC. Considering its low internal
luminosity ($0.08\pm0.01$ L$_{\odot}$) and accretion rate (2.8$\times10^{-8}$
M$_{\sun}$~yr$^{-1}$), G192S is an ideal proto-brown dwarf candidate. The star
formation efficiency ($\sim$0.3\%-0.4\%) and core formation efficiency
($\sim$1\%) in PGCC G192.32-11.88 are significantly smaller than in other giant
molecular clouds or filaments, indicating that the star formation therein is
greatly suppressed due to stellar feedback.

clustering algorithm is expected to divide the set of data instances into the
subsets which maximize the intra-subset similarity and inter-subset
dissimilarity, where a similarity measure is defined beforehand. In this work,
the state-of-the-arts clustering algorithms are reviewed from design concept to

$89.33$ milliseconds) are predicted by adopting a recently-constructed unified
treatment of all parts of neutron stars: the outer crust, the inner crust and
the core based on modern microscopic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations. To
take the pulsar mass ranging from $1.0M_{\odot}$ to $2.0M_{\odot}$, we
calculate the central density, the core/crust radii, the core/crust mass, the
core/crustal thickness, the moment of inertia, and the crustal moment of
inertia. Among them, the crustal moment of inertia could be effectively
constrained from the accumulated glitch observations, which has been a great
debate recently, known as ""glitch crisis"". Namely, superfluid neutrons
contained in the inner crust, which are regarded as the origin of the glitch in
the standard two-component model, could be largely entrained in the nuclei
lattices, then there may not be enough superfluid neutrons ($\sim 4/5$ less
than the previous value) to trigger the large glitches ($\Delta \nu/\nu_0 \sim
10^{-6}$) in the Vela pulsar. We then provide the first analysis of the crisis
based on the microscopic basis, by confronting the glitch observations with the
theoretical calculations for the crustal moment of inertia. We find that
despite some recent opposition to the crisis argument, the glitch crisis is
still present, which means that besides the crust superfluid neutrons, core
neutrons might be necessary for explaining the large glitches of the Vela
pulsar.

is being probed in greater depth than ever before. Taking advantage of
available resources, we have established a comprehensive database of black hole
(and black hole candidate) X-ray binary (BHXB) activity between 1996 and 2015
as revealed by all-sky instruments, scanning surveys, and select narrow-field
X-ray instruments aboard the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory
(INTEGRAL), Monitor of All-Sky X-ray Image (MAXI), Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer

black-Hole Database Of the Galaxy or WATCHDOG. Over the past two decades, we
have detected 132 transient outbursts, tracked and classified behavior
occurring in 47 transient and 10 persistently accreting BHs, and performed a
statistical study on a number of outburst properties across the Galactic
population. We find that outbursts undergone by BHXBs that do not reach the
thermally dominant accretion state make up a substantial fraction ($\sim$ 40%)
of the Galactic transient BHXB outburst sample over the past $\sim20$ years.
Our findings suggest that this ""hard-only"" behavior, observed in transient and
persistently accreting BHXBs, is neither a rare nor recent phenomenon and may
be indicative of an underlying physical process, relatively common among binary
BHs, involving the mass-transfer rate onto the BH remaining at a low level
rather than increasing as the outburst evolves. We discuss how the larger
number of these ""hard-only"" outbursts and detected outbursts in general have
significant implications for both the luminosity function and mass-transfer
history of the Galactic BHXB population.

while varying both subgraph composition and distribution of subgraphs around

control of key network parameters, the ability to specify to what subgraphs a
node belongs to, come at a considerable complexity cost or, critically, sample
from a limited ensemble of networks. To enable controlled investigations of the
impact and role of subgraphs, especially for epidemics, neuronal activity or
complex contagion, it is essential that the generation process be versatile and
the generated networks as diverse as possible. In this paper, we present two
new network generation algorithms that use subgraphs as building blocks to
construct networks preserving a given degree sequence. Additionally, these
algorithms provide control over clustering both at node and global level. In
both cases, we show that, despite being constrained by a degree sequence and
global clustering, generated networks have markedly different topologies as
evidenced by both subgraph prevalence and distribution around nodes, and
large-scale network structure metrics such as path length and betweenness
measures. Simulations of standard epidemic and complex contagion models on
those networks reveal that degree distribution and global clustering do not
always accurately predict the outcome of dynamical processes taking place on
them. We conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of both methods.

linearization and subsequent finite element approximation of the linearized
equations. Extensively conducted simulations show that: 1) the spatial and
temporal evolution of the cellular populations are in good agrement with the
local growth/production conditions predicted by the mechanobiological

are strongly influenced by both maximum cell specific growth rate and

principle is not straightforward, because mass conservation must be added as an
additional constraint to make rest-frame mass density variable in reaction to
metric variation. This can be avoided by introducing a constraint
$\delta(\sqrt{-g}) = 0$ to metric variations $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$, and then the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ emerges as an integration constant. This is a
removal of one of the four constraints on initial conditions forced by EFE at
the birth of the universe, and it may imply that EFE are unnecessarily
restrictive about initial conditions. I then adopt a principle that the theory
of gravity should be able to solve time evolution starting from arbitrary
inhomogeneous initial conditions about spacetime and matter. The equations of
gravitational fields satisfying this principle are obtained, by setting four
auxiliary constraints on $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$ to extract six degrees of freedom
for gravity. The cost of achieving this is a loss of general covariance, but
these equations constitute a consistent theory if they hold in the special
coordinate systems that can be uniquely specified with respect to the initial
space-like hypersurface when the universe was born. This theory predicts that
gravity is described by EFE with non-zero $\Lambda$ in a homogeneous patch of
the universe created by inflation, but $\Lambda$ changes continuously across
different patches. Then both the smallness and coincidence problems of the
cosmological constant are solved by the anthropic argument. This is just a
result of inhomogeneous initial conditions, not requiring any change of the
fundamental physical laws in different patches.
