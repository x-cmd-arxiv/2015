  the previous one, and also the application to Quot schemes",,,,"math.AC math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $ \Bbbk$ be a field of arbitrary characteristic, $A$ a Noetherian $
\Bbbk$-algebra and consider the polynomial ring $A[\mathbf
x]=A[x_0,\dots,x_n]$. We consider homogeneous submodules of $A[\mathbf x]^m$
having a special set of generators: a marked basis over a quasi-stable module.
Such a marked basis inherits several good properties of a Gr\""obner basis,
including a Noetherian reduction relation. The set of submodules of $A[\mathbf
x]^m$ having a marked basis over a given quasi-stable module has an affine
scheme structure that we are able to exhibit. Furthermore, the syzygies of a
module generated by such a marked basis are generated by a marked basis, too
(over a suitable quasi-stable module in $\oplus^{m'}_{i=1} A[\mathbf
x](-d_i)$). We apply the construction of marked bases and related properties to
the investigation of Quot functors (and schemes). More precisely, for a given
Hilbert polynomial, we can explicitely construct (up to the action of a general
linear group) an open cover of the corresponding Quot functor made up of open
functors represented by affine schemes. This gives a new proof that the Quot
functor is the functor of points of a scheme. We also exhibit a procedure to
obtain the equations defining a given Quot scheme as a subscheme of a suitable
Grassmannian. Thanks to the good behaviour of marked bases with respect to
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, we can adapt our methods in order to study the
locus of the Quot scheme given by an upper bound on the regularity of its
points.

  We analysed 58 kink oscillation events observed by the Atmospheric Imaging

amplitude, period, length of the oscillating loop, and damping are studied for
120 individual loop oscillations.
  Analysis of the initial loop displacement and oscillation amplitude leads to
the conclusion that the initial loop displacement prescribes the initial
amplitude of oscillation in general. The period is found to scale with the loop
length, and a linear fit of the data cloud gives a kink speed of Ck
=(1330+/-50) km s-1 . The main body of the data corresponds to kink speeds in
the range Ck =(800-3300) km s-1. Measurements of 52 exponential damping times
were made, and it was noted that at least 22 of the damping profiles may be
better approximated by a combination of non-exponential and exponential
profiles, rather than a purely exponential damping envelope. There are an
additional 10 cases where the profile appears to be purely non-exponential, and
no damping time was measured. A scaling of the exponential damping time with
the period is found, following the previously established linear scaling
between these two parameters.

  mixed dispersal syndromes","15 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mixed dispersal syndromes have historically been regarded as bet-hedging
mechanisms that enhance survival in unpredictable environments, ensuring that
some propagules stay in the maternal environment while others can potentially
colonize new sites. However, this entails paying the costs of both dispersal
and non-dispersal. Propagules that disperse are likely to encounter unfavorable
conditions for establishment, while non-dispersing propagules might form
populations of close relatives burdened with inbreeding. Here, we investigate
the conditions under which mixed dispersal syndromes emerge and are
evolutionarily stable, taking into account the risks of both environmental
unpredictability and inbreeding. Using mathematical and computational modeling
we show that high dispersal propensity is favored whenever temporal
environmental unpredictability is low and inbreeding depression high, whereas
mixed dispersal syndromes are adaptive under conditions of high environmental
unpredictability, but more particularly if also inbreeding depression is small.
Although pure dispersers can be selected for under some circumstances, mixed
dispersal provides the optimal strategy under most parameterizations of our
models, indicating that this strategy is likely to be favored under a wide
variety of conditions. Furthermore, populations exhibiting any single phenotype
go inevitably extinct when environmental and genetic costs are high, whilst
mixed strategies can maintain viable populations even under such conditions.
Our models support the hypothesis that the interplay between inbreeding
depression and environmental unpredictability shapes dispersal syndromes, often
resulting in mixed strategies. Moreover, mixed dispersal seems to facilitate
persistence whenever conditions are critical or nearly critical for survival.

The aim is to minimize the sum power of BSs while satisfying user-specific SINR

algorithms for multi-cell multigroup systems. The NP-hard multicast problem is
tackled by approximating it as a convex problem using the standard semidefinite
relaxation method. The resulting semidefinite program (SDP) can be solved via
centralized processing if global channel knowledge is available. To allow a
distributed implementation, the primal decomposition method is used to turn the
SDP into two optimization levels. The higher level is in charge of optimizing
inter-cell interference while the lower level optimizes beamformers for given
inter-cell interference constraints. The distributed algorithm requires local
channel knowledge at each BS and scalar information exchange between BSs. If
the solution has unit rank, it is optimal for the original problem. Otherwise,
the Gaussian randomization method is used to find a feasible solution. The
superiority of the proposed algorithms over conventional schemes is
demonstrated via numerical evaluation.

resolution to the firewall paradox is presented. It is emphasized that if an
observer has the singularity as a part of his spacetime, then the
semi-classical evolution would be non-unitary as viewed by him. Specifically, a
free-falling observer inside the black hole would have a Hilbert space with
non-unitary evolution; a quantum jump for particles encountering the
singularity to outside of the horizon as late Hawking radiations. The
non-unitariness in the jump resembles the one in collapse of wave function, but
preserves entanglements. Accordingly, we elaborate the first postulate of black
hole complementarity: freely falling observers who pass through the event
horizon would have non-unitary evolution, while it does not have physically
measurable effects for them. Besides, no information would be lost in the
singularity. Taking the modified picture into account, the firewall paradox can
be resolved, respecting No Drama. A by-product of our modification is that
roughly half of the entropy of the black hole is released close to the end of
evaporation in the shape of very hot Hawking radiation.

PTS correlations to agnostically capture any type of growing order in liquids,

distinction between slowing down due to conventional critical ordering and that
due to glassiness, and provides a unified framework to assess the relative
importance of specific local order and generic amorphous order in glass
formation.

optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are
distributed (unevenly) over an extremely large number of \nodes, but the goal
remains to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as
Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of utmost
importance.
  A motivating example for federated optimization arises when we keep the
training data locally on users' mobile devices rather than logging it to a data
center for training. Instead, the mobile devices are used as nodes performing
computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose
that we have an extremely large number of devices in our network, each of which
has only a tiny fraction of data available totally; in particular, we expect
the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number
of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different
patterns, we assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall
distribution.
  We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and
propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results. This work
also sets a path for future research needed in the context of federated
optimization.

to the field of data management. Classification is one of the most important
data mining tasks for label prediction, categorization of objects into groups,
advertisement and data management. In this paper, we focus on the standard
classification problem which is predicting unknown labels in Euclidean space.
Most efforts in Machine Learning communities are devoted to methods that use
probabilistic algorithms which are heavy on Calculus and Linear Algebra. Most
of these techniques have scalability issues for big data, and are hardly
parallelizable if they are to maintain their high accuracies in their standard
form. Sampling is a new direction for improving scalability, using many small
parallel classifiers. In this paper, rather than conventional sampling methods,
we focus on a discrete classification algorithm with O(n) expected running
time. Our approach performs a similar task as sampling methods. However, we use
column-wise sampling of data, rather than the row-wise sampling used in the
literature. In either case, our algorithm is completely deterministic. Our
algorithm, proposes a way of combining 2D convex hulls in order to achieve high
classification accuracy as well as scalability in the same time. First, we
thoroughly describe and prove our O(n) algorithm for finding the convex hull of
a point set in 2D. Then, we show with experiments our classifier model built
based on this idea is very competitive compared with existing sophisticated
classification algorithms included in commercial statistical applications such
as MATLAB.

lateral interaction with the ambient plasma. We trace the generation and
evolution of the toroidal magnetic field generated by both kinetic
Kelvin-Helmholtz (kKH) and Mushroom instabilities (MI). This magnetic field
collimates the jet. We show that in electron-proton jet, electrons are
perpendicularly accelerated with jet collimation. The magnetic polarity
switches from the clockwise to anti-clockwise in the middle of jet, as the
instabilities weaken. For the electron-positron jet, we find strong mixture of
electron-positron with the ambient plasma, that results in the creation of a
bow shock. Merger of magnetic field current filaments generate density bumps
which initiate a forward shock. The strong mixing between jet and ambient
particles prevents full development of the jet on the studied scale. Our
results therefore provide a direct evidence for both jet collimation and
particle acceleration in the created bow shock. Differences in the magnetic
field structures generated by electron-proton and electron-positron jets may
contribute to observable differences in the polarized properties of emission by
electrons.

the form $X = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$, where the $X_i$'s are independent random
vectors supported on the set of standard basis vectors in $\mathbb{R}^k.$ In
this paper, we obtain a refined structural understanding of PMDs by analyzing
their Fourier transform. As our core structural result, we prove that the
Fourier transform of PMDs is {\em approximately sparse}, i.e., roughly
speaking, its $L_1$-norm is small outside a small set. By building on this
result, we obtain the following applications:
  {\bf Learning Theory.} We design the first computationally efficient learning
algorithm for PMDs with respect to the total variation distance. Our algorithm
learns an arbitrary $(n, k)$-PMD within variation distance $\epsilon$ using a
near-optimal sample size of $\widetilde{O}_k(1/\epsilon^2),$ and runs in time
$\widetilde{O}_k(1/\epsilon^2) \cdot \log n.$ Previously, no algorithm with a
$\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ runtime was known, even for $k=3.$
  {\bf Game Theory.} We give the first efficient polynomial-time approximation
scheme (EPTAS) for computing Nash equilibria in anonymous games. For normalized
anonymous games with $n$ players and $k$ strategies, our algorithm computes a
well-supported $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium in time $n^{O(k^3)} \cdot
(k/\epsilon)^{O(k^3\log(k/\epsilon)/\log\log(k/\epsilon))^{k-1}}.$ The best
previous algorithm for this problem had running time $n^{(f(k)/\epsilon)^k},$
where $f(k) = \Omega(k^{k^2})$, for any $k>2.$
  {\bf Statistics.} We prove a multivariate central limit theorem (CLT) that
relates an arbitrary PMD to a discretized multivariate Gaussian with the same
mean and covariance, in total variation distance. Our new CLT strengthens the
CLT of Valiant and Valiant by completely removing the dependence on $n$ in the
error bound.

electron system can be dynamically transferred to nuclear spins in its vicinity
through the hyperfine interaction. The resulting nuclear field typically acts
back locally, modifying the local electronic Zeeman energy. Here we report a
non-local effect arising from the interplay between nuclear polarization and
the spatial structure of electronic domains in a $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum
Hall state. In our experiments, we use a quantum point contact to locally
control and probe the domain structure of different spin configurations
emerging at the spin phase transition. Feedback between nuclear and electronic
degrees of freedom gives rise to memristive behavior, where electronic
transport through the quantum point contact depends on the history of current
flow. We propose a model for this effect which suggests a novel route to
studying edge states in fractional quantum Hall systems and may account for
so-far unexplained oscillatory electronic-transport features observed in
previous studies.

in recent years and with the advent of the next generation of space-based
survey telescopes, the sample will reach into the thousands. The accuracy of
strong lens models relies on robust identification of multiple image families
of lensed galaxies. For the most massive lenses, often more than one background
galaxy is magnified and multiply-imaged, and even in the cases of only a single
lensed source, identification of counter images is not always robust. Recently,
we have shown that the Gini coefficient in space-telescope-quality imaging is a
measurement of galaxy morphology that is relatively well-preserved by strong
gravitational lensing. Here, we investigate its usefulness as a diagnostic for
the purposes of image family identification and show that it can remove some of
the degeneracies encountered when using color as the sole diagnostic, and can
do so without the need for additional observations since whenever a color is
available, two Gini coefficients are as well.

operations with applications in program analysis and verification. However, the
complexity of the classical procedures for determinisation and completion is

very small ones. In this paper we develop an algorithm for determinisation and
completion of finite tree automata, whose worst-case complexity remains
unchanged, but which performs far better than existing algorithms in practice.
The critical aspect of the algorithm is that the transitions of the
determinised (and possibly completed) automaton are generated in a potentially
very compact form called product form, which can reduce the size of the
representation dramatically. Furthermore, the representation can often be used
directly when manipulating the determinised automaton. The paper contains an

many applications in the warm dense matter regime, e.g. dense plasmas and laser

present new thermodynamic results for higher temperatures. Finally, to overcome
the limitations of CPIMC towards strong coupling, we invoke an independent

explore two different methods for achieving this, the first makes use of

our polyphase filter when using lower precision input data is limited by type
conversions rather than device bandwidth. We compare these results to an

performance that is 1.47x to 1.95x greater than our CPU implementation, however
is not insufficient to compete with the performance of GPUs. We conclude with a

no disadvantage in the second scenario: Alice and Bob, without knowing the
other party's string, can achieve almost optimal compression in the sense of
Kolmogorov complexity. Furthermore, compression takes polynomial time and can
be made at any combination of lengths that satisfy some necessary conditions
(modulo additive polylog terms). More precisely, there exist probabilistic
algorithms E_1, E_2, and deterministic algorithm D, with E_1 and E_2 running in
polynomial time, having the following behavior: if n_1, n_2 are two integers
satisfying n_1 + n_2 \geq C(x_1,x_2), n_1 \geq C(x_1 | x_2), n_2 \geq C(x_2 |

more general, as it deals with the compression of any constant number of

theory of the classic Slepian-Wolf Theorem, a fundamental result in network
information theory, in which x_1 and x_2 are realizations of two discrete
random variables formed by drawing independently n times from a joint
distribution. Also, in the classical result, the decompressor needs to know the
joint distribution of the sources. In our result no type of independence is
assumed and the decompressor does not have any apriori information about the
sources that are compressed, and it still is the case that distributed
compression is on a par with centralized compression.

have a dS vacuum with $R=4\Lambda$, where Lambda is a positive cosmological

is below the present experimental upper bounds, and such correction may be
observed in the next years with more precise measurements. By considering the
value of $R$ inside some astrophysical sources and environments we find that

far from being secure. Moreover, many embedded systems rely on web interfaces
for user interaction or administration. Unfortunately, web security is known to
be difficult, and therefore the web interfaces of embedded systems represent a
considerable attack surface.
  In this paper, we present the first fully automated framework that applies
dynamic firmware analysis techniques to achieve, in a scalable manner,
automated vulnerability discovery within embedded firmware images. We apply our
framework to study the security of embedded web interfaces running in
Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) embedded devices, such as routers, DSL/cable
modems, VoIP phones, IP/CCTV cameras. We introduce a methodology and implement
a scalable framework for discovery of vulnerabilities in embedded web
interfaces regardless of the vendor, device, or architecture. To achieve this
goal, our framework performs full system emulation to achieve the execution of
firmware images in a software-only environment, i.e., without involving any
physical embedded devices. Then, we analyze the web interfaces within the
firmware using both static and dynamic tools. We also present some interesting
case-studies, and discuss the main challenges associated with the dynamic
analysis of firmware images and their web interfaces and network services. The
observations we make in this paper shed light on an important aspect of
embedded devices which was not previously studied at a large scale.
  We validate our framework by testing it on 1925 firmware images from 54
different vendors. We discover important vulnerabilities in 185 firmware
images, affecting nearly a quarter of vendors in our dataset. These
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Babcock-Leighton/Flux Transport dynamo model in which the source of poloidal
field is the explicit emergence, distortion, and dispersal of bipolar magnetic
regions (BMRs). Here we describe the STABLE model in more detail than we have
previously and we verify it by reproducing a 2D mean-field benchmark. We also
present some representative dynamo simulations, focusing on the special case of
kinematic magnetic induction and axisymmetric flow fields. Not all solutions
are supercritical; it can be a challenge for the BL mechanism to sustain the
dynamo when the turbulent diffusion near the surface is $\geq 10^{12}$ cm$^2$
s$^{-1}$. However, if BMRs are sufficiently large, deep, and numerous, then
sustained, cyclic, dynamo solutions can be found that exhibit solar-like
features. Furthermore, we find that the shearing of radial magnetic flux by the
surface differential rotation can account for most of the net toroidal flux
generation in each hemisphere, as has been recently argued for the Sun by
Cameron & Schussler (2015).

because images of such galaxies are typically highly distorted. Lens modeling
and source plane reconstruction is one approach that can provide reasonably
undistorted images from which morphological measurements can be made, although
at the expense of a highly spatially variable telescope PSF when mapped back to
the source plane. Unfortunately, modeling the lensing mass is a time and
resource intensive process, and in many cases there are too few constraints to
precisely model the lensing mass. If, however, useful morphological
measurements could be made in the image plane rather than the source plane, it
would bypass this issue and obviate the need for a source reconstruction
process for some applications. We examine the use of the Gini coefficient as
one such measurement. Because it depends on the cumulative distribution of the
light of a galaxy, but not the relative spatial positions, the fact that
surface brightness is conserved by lensing means that the Gini coefficient may
be well-preserved by strong gravitational lensing. Through simulations, we test
the extent to which the Gini coefficient is conserved, including by effects due
to PSF convolution and pixelization, to determine whether it is invariant
enough under lensing to be used as a measurement of galaxy morphology that can
be made in the image plane.

ordered family of at least k vectors in (F_q)^k in which every subfamily of

unless q is even and k=3 or k=q-1, in which case it has size at most q+2.
  We propose a conjecture which would imply that the MDS conjecture is true for
almost all values of k when q is odd. We prove our conjecture in two cases and
thus give simpler proofs of the MDS conjecture when k <= p, and if q is not
prime, for k <= 2p-2. To accomplish this, given an arc G of (F_q)^k and a
nonnegative integer n, we construct a matrix M_G^{\uparrow n}, which is related
to an inclusion matrix, a well-studied object in combinatorics. Our main
results relate algebraic properties of the matrix M_G^{\uparrow n} to
properties of the arc G and may provide new tools in the computational
classification of large arcs.

technologically relevant material properties including ferroelectricity,
thermoelectricity, and phase-change behaviour. In the case of many group IV-VI,
V, and related materials, these interactions are strong and the materials exist
near electronic and structural phase transitions. Their close proximity to
phase instability produces a fragile balance among the various properties. The
prototypical example is PbTe whose incipient ferroelectric behaviour has been
associated with large phonon anharmonicity and thermoelectricity. Experimental
measurements on PbTe reveal anomalous lattice dynamics, especially in the soft
transverse optical phonon branch. This has been interpreted in terms of both
giant anharmonicity and local symmetry breaking due to off-centering of the Pb
ions. The observed anomalies have prompted renewed theoretical and
computational interest, which has in turn revived focus on the extent that
electron-phonon interactions drive lattice instabilities in PbTe and related
materials. Here, we use Fourier-transform inelastic x-ray scattering (FT-IXS)
to show that photo-injection of free carriers stabilizes the paraelectric
state. With support from constrained density functional theory (CDFT)
calculations, we find that photoexcitation weakens the long-range forces along
the cubic direction tied to resonant bonding and incipient ferroelectricity.

determining the equilibrium structure.

that affects more that 6 million people worldwide. Motor dysfunction gradually
increases as the disease progress. It is usually mild in the early stages of
the disease but it relentlessly progresses to a severe or very severe
disability that is characterized by increasing degrees of bradykinesia,
hypokinesia, muscle rigidity, loss of postural reflexes and balance control as
well as freezing of gait. In addition to a line of treatment based on
dopaminergic PD-specific drugs, attending neurologists strongly recommend
regular exercise combined with physiotherapy. However, the routine of
traditional rehabilitation often create boredom and loss of interest.
Opportunities to liven up a daily exercise schedule may well take the form of
character-based virtual reality games which engage the player to physically
train in a non-linear and looser fashion, providing an experience that varies
from one game loop the next. Such ""exergames"", a word that results from the
amalgamation of the words ""exercise"" and ""game"" challenge patients into
performing movements of varying complexity in a playful and immersive virtual
environment. In fact, today's game consoles using controllers like Nintendo's
Wii, Sony PlayStation Eye and the Microsoft Kinect sensor present new
opportunities to infuse motivation and variety to an otherwise mundane
physiotherapy routine. But are these controllers and the games built for them
appropriate for PD patients? In this paper we present some of these approaches
and discuss their suitability for these patients mainly on the basis of demands
made on balance, agility and gesture precision.

existence of a collective mode in the superconducting state. We show that both

magnetically-mediated Raman intensity at the leading two-loop order and then
include interactions between pairs of magnetic fluctuations. We show that the
full Raman intensity in the $B_{1g}$ channel can be viewed as the result of the
coupling of light to Ising-nematic susceptibility via Aslamazov-Larkin process.
We argue that the singular temperature dependence in the normal state is the
combination of the temperature dependencies of the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex and
of Ising-nematic susceptibility. We discuss two scenarios for the resonance
below $T_c$. In one, the resonance is due to the development of a pole in the

projecting out all but a single gravitational sector, in order to achieve
correct semi-classical behavior. In this paper we calculate the gravitational
two-point function predicted by the proper spin-foam vertex to lowest order in
the vertex expansion. We find the same answer as in the EPRL case in the
`continuum spectrum' limit, so that the theory is consistent with the
predictions of linearized gravity in the regime of small curvature. The method
for calculating the two-point function is similar to that used in prior works:
we cast it in terms of an action integral and to use stationary phase methods.
Thus, the calculation of the Hessian matrix plays a key role. Once the Hessian
is calculated, it is used not only to calculate the two-point function, but
also to calculate the coefficient appearing in the semi-classical limit of the
proper vertex amplitude itself. This coefficient is the effective discrete
""measure factor"" encoded in the spin-foam model. Through a non-trivial
cancellation of different factors, we find that this coefficient is the same as
the coefficient in front of the term in the asymptotics of the EPRL vertex
corresponding to the selected gravitational sector.

  Problems","Submitted to SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing (SISC)",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One difficulty in developing numerical methods for hyperbolic systems of
conservation laws is the fact that solutions often contain regions where much
higher resolution is required than elsewhere in the domain, particularly since
the solution may contain discontinuities or other localized features. The
Clawpack software deals with this issue by using block-structured adaptive mesh
refinement to selectively refine around propagating waves. For problems where
only a target area of the total solution is of interest, a method that allows
identifying and refining the grid only in regions that influence this target
area would significantly reduce the computational cost of finding a solution.
  In this work, we show that solving the time-dependent adjoint equation and
using a suitable inner product with the forward solution allows more precise
refinement of the relevant waves. We present acoustics examples in one and two
dimensions and a tsunami propagation example. To perform these simulations, the
use of the adjoint method has been integrated into the adaptive mesh refinement
strategy of the open source Clawpack and GeoClaw software. We also present
results that show that the accuracy of the solution is maintained and the
computational time required is significantly reduced through the integration of
the adjoint method into AMR.

stability within the Standard Model (SM) by the knowledge of the behaviour of
the Higgs quartic coupling up to high energy scales and using the new data on
the Higgs mass given by ATLAS and CMS as an input parameter. The Higgs mass
value observed by ATLAS and CMS leads to a negative value of the quartic
coupling, making metastable the vacuum of the Standard Model, as it is seen by
the renormalization group improved (RGI) effective potential. The stability
status of SM crucially depends upon the precise values of the top and Higgs
masses, a more precision determination of those masses and related
uncertainties can modify drastically our conclusions about the SM stability
properties. For this reason, we have computed the vacuum bubbles and the Higgs
tadpole diagrams, at two-loop level of accuracy, in a renormalization scheme
proposed by A. Sirlin and R. Zucchini, where the input parameters are obtained
in terms of physical observables related with muon decay, and where the
threshold effects are included. In particular, we focus on the analytic
computation of the Higgs tadpoles contributions by two different methods. From
one side we have computed the sum of the tadpoles as the first derivative of
the two-loop Higgs 1PI effective potential in the Sirlin-Zucchini scheme, on
the other side we have checked the obtained result toward the direct
diagrammatic two- loop computation, by proposing a way of automatization of our
procedure based on the generation of Feynman diagrams, reduction of their
integrands and evaluation of scalar integrals and sum of all contributions in a
non-redundant way. We used the code TARCER that implements the Tarasov method

supermassive black holes, and is an important ingredient in models of the

determine quasar lifetimes, current estimates from a variety of methods are
uncertain by orders of magnitude. This work combines cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations and 1D radiative transfer to investigate the
structure and evolution of the He II Ly$\alpha$ proximity zones around quasars
at $z \simeq 3-4$. We show that the time evolution in the proximity zone can be
described by a simple analytical model for the approach of the He II fraction
$x_{\rm HeII}\left( t \right)$ to ionization equilibrium, and use this picture
to illustrate how the transmission profile depends on the quasar lifetime,
quasar UV luminosity, and the ionization state of helium in the ambient IGM
(i.e. the average He II fraction, or equivalently the metagalactic He II
ionizing background). A significant degeneracy exists between the lifetime and
the average He II fraction, however the latter can be determined from
measurements of the He II Ly$\alpha$ optical depth far from quasars, allowing
the lifetime to be measured. We advocate stacking existing He II quasar spectra
at $z\sim 3$, and show that the shape of this average proximity zone profile is
sensitive to lifetimes as long as $\sim 30$ Myr. At higher redshift $z\sim 4$
where the He II fraction is poorly constrained, degeneracies will make it
challenging to determine these parameters independently. Our analytical model
for He II proximity zones should also provide a useful description of the

provide information on the nature of the turbulence cascade. However, the
Fourier power spectrum only contains the Fourier amplitudes and rejects all
information regarding the Fourier phases. Here we investigate the utility of
two statistical diagnostics for recovering information on Fourier phases in ISM
density data: the averaged amplitudes of the bispectrum and the phase coherence
index (PCI), a new phase technique for the ISM. We create 3D density and 2D
column density maps using a set of simulations of isothermal ideal MHD
turbulence with a wide range of sonic and Alfv\'enic Mach numbers. We find that
the bispectrum averaged along different angles with respect to either the $k_1$
or $k_2$ axis is primarily sensitive to the sonic Mach number while averaging
the bispectral amplitudes over different annuli is sensitive to both the sonic
and Alfv\'enic Mach numbers. The PCI of density suggests that the most
correlated phases occur in supersonic sub-Alfv\'enic turbulence and also near
the numerical dissipation regime. This suggests that non-linear interactions
with correlated phases are strongest in shock dominated regions, in agreement
with findings from the solar wind. Additionally, our results are particularly
encouraging as they suggests the phase information contained in the bispectrum

work by further exploring the effects of priors on the kinematics of the lens

results coming from RXJ1131-1231 are given in a simple analytic form so that
they can be easily combined with constraints coming from other cosmological

size are subdominant for the statistical errors for $H_0$ measurements of this
systems. The choice of prior for the source is sub-dominant at present (2%
uncertainty on $H_0$) but may be relevant for future studies. More importantly,
we find that the priors on the kinematic anisotropy of the lens galaxy have a
significant impact on our cosmological inference. When incorporating all the
above modeling uncertainties, we find $H_0 = 86.6^{+6.8}_{-6.9}$ km
s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, when using kinematic priors similar to other studies. When
we use a different kinematic prior motivated by Barnab\`e et al. (2012) but
covering the same anisotropic range, we find $H_0 = 74.5^{+8.0}_{-7.8}$ km
s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. This means that the choice of kinematic modeling and priors
have a significant impact on cosmographic inferences. The way forward is either
to get better velocity dispersion measures which would down weight the impact
of the priors or to construct physically motivated priors for the velocity
dispersion model.

perfect accretion, and many of these studies lack the large number of
realizations needed to account for the chaotic nature of N-body systems. We
improve on these limitations by performing 280 simulations of planet formation
around a Sun-like star, half of which used an N-body algorithm that has
recently been modified to include fragmentation and hit-and-run (bouncing)
collisions. We find that when fragmentation is included, the final planets
formed are comparable in terms of mass and number, however their collision
histories differ significantly and the accretion time approximately doubles. We
explored impacts onto Earth-like planets which we parameterized in terms of
their specific impact energies. Only 15 of our 164 Earth-analogs experienced an
impact that was energetic enough to strip an entire atmosphere. To strip about
half of an atmosphere requires energies comparable to recent models of the
Moon-forming giant impact. Almost all Earth-analogs received at least one
impact that met this criteria during the 2 Gyr simulations and the median was
three giant impacts. The median time of the final giant impact was 43 Myr after
the start of the simulations, leading us to conclude that the time-frame of the
Moon-forming impact is typical amongst planetary systems around Sun-like stars.

sum of black-hole entropy, $S_{\text{BH}}=Ac^3/4\hbar G$ (here $A$ is the
black-hole surface area), and the ordinary entropy of matter and radiation
fields in the black-hole exterior region never decreases. We here re-analyze an
intriguing gedanken experiment which was designed by Bekenstein to challenge
the GSL. In this historical gedanken experiment an entropy-bearing box is
lowered into a charged Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole. For the GSL to work,
the resulting increase in the black-hole surface area (entropy) must compensate
for the loss of the box's entropy. We show that if the box can be lowered
adiabatically all the way down to the black-hole horizon, as previously assumed
in the literature, then for near-extremal black holes the resulting increase in
black-hole surface-area (due to the assimilation of the box by the black hole)
may become too small to compensate for the loss of the box's entropy. In order
to resolve this apparent violation of the GSL, we here suggest to use a
generalized version of the hoop conjecture. In particular, assuming that a
physical system of mass $M$ and electric charge $Q$ forms a black hole if its
circumference radius $r_{\text{c}}$ is equal to (or smaller than) the
corresponding Reissner-Nordstr\""om black-hole radius
$r_{\text{RN}}=M+\sqrt{M^2-Q^2}$, we prove that a new (and larger) horizon is
already formed before the entropy-bearing box reaches the horizon of the
original near-extremal black hole. This result, which seems to have been
overlooked in previous analyzes of the composed black-hole-box system, ensures
the validity of Bekenstein's GSL in this famous gedanken experiment.

volume decrease in our dual gravity model, which consists of a codimension one
hypersurface embedded in a BTZ black hole background in three dimensions. There
are matter fields defined on this hypersurface which are dual to Kondo field
theory operators. In the large N limit, the formation of the Kondo cloud
corresponds to the condensation of a scalar field. The entropy is calculated
according to the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription. This requires to determine the
backreaction of the hypersurface on the BTZ geometry, which is achieved by
solving the Israel junction conditions. We find that the larger the scalar
condensate gets, the more the volume of constant time slices in the bulk is
reduced, shortening the bulk geodesics and reducing the impurity entropy. This
provides a new non-trivial example of an RG flow satisfying the g-theorem.
Moreover, we find explicit expressions for the impurity entropy which are in
agreement with previous field theory results for free electrons. This
demonstrates the universality of perturbing about an IR fixed point.

ascribed to turbulence acting against the gravitational collapse, or to the
self-gravity itself driving the rapid global collapse. The dependence between
velocity dispersion, radius and clouds surface density found by Heyer et al.
(2009), $\sigma/R^{1/2}\propto \Sigma^{1/2}$, has been interpreted in terms of
global collapse of clouds. In this work we demonstrate that this relation is an
expression of a more general relation between accelerations. We introduce the
gravo-turbulent acceleration, a$_k$, which describe the non-thermal motions in
each region, and the acceleration generated by the gravitational field a$_G$,
which is proportional to $\Sigma$. We also introduce a new coefficient, the
force partition coefficient $\alpha_{for}$ which is equivalent to the virial
parameter but does not distinguish between collapsing and non-collapsing
regions. In this work we use the a$_k$ - a$_G$ formalism in the analysis of a
new sample of 16 massive starless clumps (MSCls) combined with data from the
literature. We show that a$_k$ and a$_G$ are not independent. The non-thermal
motions in each region can originate from both local turbulence and
self-gravity but overall the data in the a$_k$ vs. a$_G$ diagram demonstrate
that the majority of the non-thermal motions originate from self-gravity. We

overlap valence quarks on 2+1-flavor domain-wall fermion gauge configurations
on a $24^3 \times 64$ lattice with the light sea mass at $m_{\pi} = 330$ MeV.
To satisfy the AWI, the overlap fermion for the pseudoscalar density and the
overlap Dirac operator for the topological density, which do not have
multiplicative renormalization, are used to normalize the form factor of the
local axial-vector current at finite $q^2$. For the charm quark, we find that
the negative pseudoscalar term almost cancels the positive topological term.
For the strange quark, the pseudoscalar term is less negative than that of the
charm. By imposing the AWI, the strange $g_A(q^2)$ at $q^2 =0$ is obtained by a
global fit of the pseudoscalar and the topological form factors, together with
$g_A(q^2)$ and the induced pseudoscalar form factor $h_A(q^2)$ at finite $q^2$.

gravitational lensing, in particular, probes the properties of the dense cores

the distant universe at flux levels and spatial resolutions otherwise

scientific opportunities. One of the challenges in realizing the potential of
strong lensing is to understand the statistical context of both the individual
systems that receive extensive follow-up study, as well as that of the larger
samples of strong lenses that are now emerging from survey efforts. Motivated
by these challenges, we have developed an image-simulation pipeline, PICS
(Pipeline for Images of Cosmological Strong lensing) to generate realistic
strong gravitational lensing signals from group and cluster scale lenses. PICS
uses a low-noise and unbiased density estimator based on (resampled) Delaunay
Tessellations to calculate the density field; lensed images are produced by
ray-tracing images of actual galaxies from deep Hubble Space Telescope
observations. Other galaxies, similarly sampled, are added to fill in the light
cone. The pipeline further adds cluster-member galaxies and foreground stars
into the lensed images. The entire image ensemble is then observed using a
realistic point spread function which includes appropriate detector artifacts
for bright stars. Noise is further added, including such non-Gaussian elements
as noise window-paning from mosaiced observations, residual bad pixels, and
cosmic rays. The aim is to produced simulated images that appear identical - to
the eye (expert or otherwise) - to real observations in various imaging
surveys.

thermalizes through a many-body process involving exchange of a diverging

Our model implicitly accounts for the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, which we show

reveal a strong eastward motion of the atmosphere of HD$\,$189733b, with a
redshift of $2.3^{+1.3}_{-1.5}$$\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$ on the leading limb of the

planetary rotation and an eastward equatorial jet; closely matching the
predictions of atmospheric circulation models. Our results show that the sodium
absorption of HD$\,$189733b is intrinsically velocity broadened and so previous
studies of the average transmission spectrum are likely to have overestimated
the role of pressure and thermal broadening.

important Galactic foreground in the microwave frequencies, and its
polarization level may pose great challenges for achieving reliable
measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode signal. To obtain
theoretical constraints on the polarization of MDE, we first compute the degree
of alignment of big silicate grains incorporated with magnetic inclusions. We
find that, in realistic conditions of the interstellar medium, thermally
rotating big grains with magnetic inclusions are weakly aligned and achieve
{\it alignment saturation} when the magnetic alignment rate becomes much faster
than the rotational damping rate. We then compute the degree of alignment for
free-flying magnetic nanoparticles, taking into account various interaction
processes of grains with the ambient gas and radiation field, including neutral
collisions, ion collisions, and infrared emission. We find that the rotational
damping by infrared emission can significantly decrease the degree of alignment
of small particles from the saturation level, whereas the excitation by ion
collisions can enhance the alignment of ultrasmall particles. Using the
computed degrees of alignment, we predict the polarization level of MDE from
free-flying magnetic nanoparticles to be rather low. Such a polarization level
is within the upper limits measured for anomalous microwave emission (AME),
which indicates that MDE from free-flying iron particles may not be ruled out
as a source of AME. We also quantify spinning dust emission from free-flying
iron nanoparticles with permanent magnetic moments and find that its emissivity
is one order of magnitude lower than that from spinning polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs). Finally, we compute the polarization spectra of spinning
dust emission from PAHs for the different interstellar magnetic fields.

counterparts, emit the bulk of their pulsed emission as a hard-to-soft
component that can be fitted by the Norris et al. (2005) empirical pulse model.
This signal is overlaid by a fainter, three-peaked signal that can be modeled
by an empirical wave-like function (Hakkila and Preece, 2014): the two fits
combine to reproduce GRB pulses with distinctive three-peaked shapes. The
precursor peak appears on or before the pulse rise and is often the hardest
component, the central peak is the brightest, and the decay peak converts
exponentially decaying emission into a long, soft, power-law tail. Accounting
for systematic instrumental differences, the general characteristics of the
fitted pulses are remarkably similar. Isolated GRB pulses are dominated by
hard-to-soft evolution; this is more pronounced for asymmetric pulses than for
symmetric ones. Isolated GRB pulses can also exhibit intensity tracking
behaviors that, when observed, are tied to the timing of the three peaks:
pulses with the largest maximum hardnesses are hardest during the precursor,
those with smaller maximum hardnesses are hardest during the central peak, and
all pulses can re-harden during the central peak and/or during the decay peak.
Since these behaviors are essentially seen in all isolated pulses, the
distinction between ""hard-to-soft"" and ""intensity-tracking"" pulses really no
longer applies. Additionally, the triple-peaked nature of isolated GRB pulses
seems to indicate that energy is injected on three separate occasions during
the pulse duration: theoretical pulse models need to account for this.

detect strong, variable H-alpha emission lines, consisting of multiple
components which vary with orbital phase. We estimate the extinction to the

Since a portfolio is essentially the same after a wash sale, any tax advantage

unchanged so any loss captured by the wash sale is deemed to be solely for tax
advantage and not investment purposes.
  This paper starts by exploring variations of the birthday problem to model
wash sales. The birthday problem is: Determine the number of independent and
identically distributed random variables required so there is a probability of
at least 1/2 that two or more of these random variables share the same outcome.
This paper gives necessary conditions for wash sales based on variations on the
birthday problem. This allows us to answer questions such as: What is the
likelihood of a wash sale in an unmanaged portfolio where purchases and sales
are independent, uniform, and random? This paper ends by exploring the

inherent structure of the equilibrium liquid, originating solely from cluster
connections; this trait can then be inherited in the metallic glass formed via
subsequent quenching of the parent liquid through the glass transition, in the
absence of any additional type of local structural order. Increasing ordering

sensitivity to the velocity power spectrum in high opacity regimes of the
interstellar medium (ISM). For our analysis we use synthetic
Position-Position-Velocity (PPV) cubes of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations, post processed to include radiative
transfer effects from CO. We find that PCA analysis is very different from the
tools based on the traditional power spectrum of PPV data cubes. Our major
finding is that PCA is also sensitive to the phase information of PPV cubes and
this allows PCA to detect the changes of the underlying velocity and density
spectra at high opacities, where the spectral analysis of the maps provides the
universal -3 spectrum in accordance with the predictions of Lazarian \&
Pogosyan (2004) theory. This makes PCA potentially a valuable tool for studies
of turbulence at high opacities provided that the proper gauging of the PCA
index is made. The later, however, we found to be not easy, as the PCA results
change in an irregular way for data with high sonic Mach numbers. This is in
contrast to synthetic Brownian noise data used for velocity and density fields
that show monotonic PCA behavior. We attribute this difference to the PCA's
sensitivity to Fourier phase information.

still unclear. Aims: We study the self-organisation of initially uniform
sub-equipartition magnetic fields by highly stratified turbulent convection.
Methods: We perform simulations of magnetoconvection in Cartesian domains that
are $8.5$-$24$ Mm deep and $34$-$96$ Mm wide. We impose either a vertical or a
horizontal uniform magnetic field in a convection-driven turbulent flow.
Results: We find that super-equipartition magnetic flux concentrations are
formed near the surface with domain depths of $12.5$ and $24$ Mm. The size of
the concentrations increases as the box size increases and the largest
structures ($20$ Mm horizontally) are obtained in the 24 Mm deep models. The
field strength in the concentrations is in the range of $3$-$5$ kG. The
concentrations grow approximately linearly in time. The effective magnetic
pressure measured in the simulations is positive near the surface and negative
in the bulk of the convection zone. Its derivative with respect to the mean
magnetic field, however, is positive in the majority of the domain, which is
unfavourable for the negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI).
Furthermore, we find that magnetic flux is concentrated in regions of
converging flow corresponding to large-scale supergranulation convection
pattern. Conclusions: The linear growth of large-scale flux concentrations
implies that their dominant formation process is tangling of the large-scale
field rather than an instability. One plausible mechanism explaining both the
linear growth and the concentrate on of the flux in the regions of converging
flow pattern is flux expulsion. Possible reasons for the absence of NEMPI are
that the derivative of the effective magnetic pressure with respect to the mean
magnetic field has an unfavourable sign and that there may not be sufficient
scale separation.

recordings of brain activity with high temporal resolution, and thus provide a
unique window to study fast time-scale neural dynamics in humans. However, the
accuracy of brain activity estimates resulting from these data is limited
mainly because 1) the number of sensors is much smaller than the number of
sources, and 2) the low sensitivity of the recording device to deep or radially
oriented sources. These factors limit the number of sources that can be
recovered and bias estimates to superficial cortical areas, resulting in the
need to include a priori information about the source activity. The question of
how to specify this information and how it might lead to improved solutions
remains a critical open problem. In this paper we show that the incorporation
of knowledge about the brain's underlying connectivity and spatiotemporal
dynamics could dramatically improve inverse solutions. To do this, we develop
the concept of the \textit{dynamic lead field mapping}, which expresses how
information about source activity at a given time is mapped not only to the
immediate measurement, but to a time series of measurements. With this mapping
we show that the number of source parameters that can be recovered could
increase by up to a factor of ${\sim20}$, and that such improvement is
primarily represented by deep cortical areas. Our result implies that future
developments in MEG/EEG analysis that model spatialtemporal dynamics have the
potential to dramatically increase source resolution.

celebrated polynomial identity testing (PIT) for symbolic determinants. In
contrast to the commutative case, which has an efficient probabilistic
algorithm, the best previous algorithm for the non-commutative setting required
exponential time (whether or not randomization is allowed). The algorithm
efficiently solves the ""word problem"" for the free skew field, and the identity
testing problem for arithmetic formulae with division over non-commuting
variables, two problems which had only exponential-time algorithms prior to
this work.
  The main contribution of this paper is a complexity analysis of an existing
algorithm due to Gurvits, who proved it was polynomial time for certain classes
of inputs. We prove it always runs in polynomial time. The main component of
our analysis is a simple (given the necessary known tools) lower bound on
central notion of capacity of operators (introduced by Gurvits). We extend the
algorithm to actually approximate capacity to any accuracy in polynomial time,
and use this analysis to give quantitative bounds on the continuity of capacity
(the latter is used in a subsequent paper on Brascamp-Lieb inequalities).
  Symbolic matrices in non-commuting variables, and the related structural and
algorithmic questions, have a remarkable number of diverse origins and
motivations. They arise independently in (commutative) invariant theory and
representation theory, linear algebra, optimization, linear system theory,
quantum information theory, approximation of the permanent and naturally in
non-commutative algebra. We provide a detailed account of some of these sources

crit}$ = 1.1$\times$10$^{15}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) in a $\Lambda$CDM universe using
10 different codes (RAMSES, 2 incarnations of AREPO and 7 of GADGET), modeling
hydrodynamics with full radiative subgrid physics. These codes include
Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), spanning traditional and advanced SPH
schemes, adaptive mesh and moving mesh codes. Our goal is to study the
consistency between simulated clusters modeled with different radiative
physical implementations - such as cooling, star formation and AGN feedback. We
compare images of the cluster at $z=0$, global properties such as mass, and
radial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. We find
that, with respect to non-radiative simulations, dark matter is more centrally
concentrated, the extent not simply depending on the presence/absence of AGN
feedback. The scatter in global quantities is substantially higher than for
non-radiative runs. Intriguingly, adding radiative physics seems to have washed
away the marked code-based differences present in the entropy profile seen for
non-radiative simulations in Sembolini et al. (2015): radiative physics +
classic SPH can produce entropy cores. Furthermore, the inclusion/absence of
AGN feedback is not the dividing line -as in the case of describing the stellar
content- for whether a code produces an unrealistic temperature inversion and a
falling central entropy profile. However, AGN feedback does strongly affect the
overall stellar distribution, limiting the effect of overcooling and reducing
sensibly the stellar fraction.

they have been shown to possess a chiral phase of intact global $U(N_f)\times

infinite volume limit. Extension to weaker coupling does not appear feasible in
the presence of complex fermion determinant. For theories with real
determinant, however, such as 2-color QCD with fundamental fermions, or any
$N_c$ with even $N_f$ and adjoint fermions, such large $\mu$ cluster expansions
can be used to show chiral behavior of fermionic lattice observables at any
gauge coupling. Unfortunately, this absence of color
superfluidity/superconductivity at high $\mu$ appears to be a lattice artifact
due to lattice saturation, a serious problem plaguing the standard finite

of galaxies via galaxy density and clustering analyses up to $z \sim 2.5$. The
clustering strength of quiescent galaxies exceeds that of star-forming
galaxies, implying that quiescent galaxies are preferentially located in more
massive halos. When using local density measurement, we find a clear positive
quiescent fraction--density relation at $z < 1$, consistent with earlier
results. However, the quiescent fraction--density relation reverses its trend
at intermediate redshifts ($1 < z < 1.5$) with marginal significance
(<1.8$\sigma$) and is found to be scale dependent (1.6$\sigma$). The lower
fraction of quiescent galaxies seen in large-scale dense environments, if
confirmed to be true, may be associated with the fact that the star formation
can be more easily sustained via cold stream accretion in `large-scale'
high-density regions, preventing galaxies from permanent quenching. Finally, at
$z > 1.5$, the quiescent fraction depends little on the local density, even
though clustering shows that quiescent galaxies are in more massive halos. We
argue that at high redshift the typical halo size falls below $10^{13}$
$M_{\odot}$, where intrinsically the local density measurements are so varied
that they do not trace the halo mass. Our results thus suggest that in the
high-redshift Universe, halo mass may be the key in quenching the star
formation in galaxies, rather than the conventionally measured galaxy density.

we can relax the constraint that $d_{max} = O(S^{\frac{1}{2}-\tau})$ and
replace it with $a_{max} b_{max} = O(S^{1-\tau})$. where $a_{max}$ and
$b_{max}$ are the maximum values for $a$ and $b$ respectively. The previous

matrix factorization based dual regularization framework SimMF is proposed to
flexibly integrate different types of information through adopting the

signals directly in compressed form, using far fewer measurements than
traditional theory dictates. Recently, many so-called signal space methods have
been developed to extend this body of work to signals sparse in arbitrary
dictionaries rather than orthonormal bases. In doing so, CS can be utilized in
a much broader array of practical settings. Often, such approaches often rely
on the ability to optimally project a signal onto a small number of dictionary
atoms. Such optimal, or even approximate, projections have been difficult to
derive theoretically. Nonetheless, it has been observed experimentally that
conventional CS approaches can be used for such projections, and still provide
accurate signal recovery. In this letter, we summarize the empirical evidence
and clearly demonstrate for what signal types certain CS methods may be used as
approximate projections. In addition, we provide theoretical guarantees for
such methods for certain sparse signal structures. Our theoretical results
match those observed in experimental studies, and we thus establish both
experimentally and theoretically that these CS methods can be used in this

describe the mechanisms responsible for the decay of the persistent currents

as follows. We are given $n$ stochastic bandit arms. The $i$th arm has a reward
distribution $D_i$ with an unknown mean $\mu_{i}$. Upon each play of the $i$th
arm, we can get a reward, sampled i.i.d. from $D_i$. We would like to identify
the arm with the largest mean with probability at least $1-\delta$, using as
few samples as possible. We provide a nontrivial algorithm for BEST-1-ARM,
which improves upon several prior upper bounds on the same problem. We also
study an important special case where there are only two arms, which we call
the sign problem. We provide a new lower bound of sign, simplifying and
significantly extending a classical result by Farrell in 1964, with a
completely new proof. Using the new lower bound for sign, we obtain the first
lower bound for BEST-1-ARM that goes beyond the classic Mannor-Tsitsiklis lower
bound, by an interesting reduction from Sign to BEST-1-ARM. We propose an
interesting conjecture concerning the optimal sample complexity of BEST-1-ARM
from the perspective of instance-wise optimality.

spontaneous emission from a single emitter near the tip is investigated
systematically for the side-illumination tip enhanced spectroscopy (TES). In
contrast with the bare tapered metal tip in conventional side-illumination TES,
the corrugated probe not only enhances strongly local excitation field but also
concentrates the emission directivity, which leads to high collection
efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio. In particular, we propose an asymmetric
TES tip based on two coupling nanorods with different length at the apex to
realize unidirectional enhanced emission rate from a single emitter.
Interestingly, we find that the radiation pattern is sensitive to the emission
wavelength and the emitter positions respective to the apex, which can result
in an increase of signal-to-noise ratio by suppressing undesired signal. The
proposed asymmetrical corrugated probe opens up a broad range of practical
applications, e.g. increasing the detection efficiency of tip enhanced
spectroscopy at the single-molecule level.

holding different opinions about the public available information. The
deleveraging shock forces the high confidence investors to liquidate their
risky assets to pay back their margin loans. When short sales are constrained,
the deleveraging shock creates a liquidity vacuum in which no trades can occur
between the two representative investors until the price drop to a threshold
below which low confidence investors take over the reduced demands. There are
two roles short sellers could play to stabilize the market. First, short
sellers provide extra supply in a bullish market so that the price of the asset
is settled lower than otherwise. Second, short sellers catch the falling price
earlier in the deleveraging process if they are previously allowed to hold a
larger short position. We apply our model to explain the recent deleveraging
crisis of the Chinese market with great success.

of six nearby galaxies are modeled, employing a three dimensional Monte Carlo

Explorer FUV band images were fitted with the model. The observed images are in
general well reproduced by two dust layers and one light-source layer, whose
vertical and radial distributions have exponential profiles. We obtained
several important physical parameters, such as star formation rate (SFR_UV),
face-on optical depth, and scale-heights. Three galaxies (NGC 891, NGC 3628,

However, it is found that the rest three targets (IC 5249, NGC 24, and NGC
4173) do not necessarily need a thick dust disk to model the ultraviolet (UV)
halo, because its contribution is too small and the UV halo may be caused by
the wing part of the GALEX point spread function. This indicates that the
galaxy samples reported to have UV halos may be contaminated by galaxies with
negligible extraplanar (halo) dust. The galaxies showing evidence of the
extraplanar dust layer fall within a narrow range on the scatter plots between
physical parameters such as SFR_UV and extraplanar dust mass. Several
mechanisms possible to produce the extraplanar dust are discussed. We also
found a hint that the extraplanar dust scale-height might not be much different

many dispatch frameworks have been proposed, including robust unit commitment
(RUC) considering wind variation. One of the drawbacks that commonly exist in
those dispatch frameworks is increased demand on flexibility resources and
associated costs. To improve wind dispatchability and reduce flexibility
resource costs, in this paper, we propose a novel RUC model considering
strategic wind generation curtailment (WGC). Strategic WGC can reduce wind
uncertainty and variability and increase the visibility of wind generation
capacity. As a result, the ramping requirement for wind generation will be
reduced and ramp-up capability of wind generation can be increased, leading to
reduced day-ahead operational cost with guaranteed operational reliability
requirement of power systems. The economic benefits also include profits gained
by wind farm by providing ramping-up capacities other auxiliary services. We
also propose a solution algorithm based on the column and constraint generation

soft matter systems. In many systems, bundles are formed when a short-range
attraction of diverse physical origin like charge-bridging, hydrogen-bonding or
hydrophobic interaction, overcomes the longer- range charge repulsion. In this
Letter, we present a general mechanism of bundle formation in these systems as
the breaking of the translational invariance in parallel aligned polymers with
competing interactions of this type. We derive a criterion for finite-sized

apply this framework to estimating scale-free graphs and learning multiple

transduction. Accordingly, the thermodynamic efficiency of this conversion
process is one of the most essential characteristics of living organisms.
However, although these processes occur under conditions of dynamic metabolism,
most studies of cellular thermodynamic efficiency have been restricted to
examining steady states; thus, the relevance of dynamics to this efficiency has
not yet been elucidated. Here, we develop a simple model of metabolic reactions
with anabolism-catabolism coupling catalysed by enzymes. Through application of
external oscillation in the enzyme abundances, the thermodynamic efficiency of
metabolism was found to be improved. This result is in strong contrast with
that observed in the oscillatory input, in which the efficiency always
decreased with oscillation. This improvement was effectively achieved by
separating the anabolic and catabolic reactions, which tend to disequilibrate
each other, and taking advantage of the temporal oscillations so that each of
the antagonistic reactions could progress near equilibrium. In this case,
anti-phase oscillation between the reaction flux and chemical affinity through
oscillation of enzyme abundances is essential. This improvement was also
confirmed in a model capable of generating autonomous oscillations in enzyme
abundances. Finally, the possible relevance of the improvement in thermodynamic
efficiency is discussed with respect to the potential for manipulation of
metabolic oscillations in microorganisms.

given by a coarse graining of the Wigner function within the minimum

semi-classical approximation with the use of classical YM equation. It should
be noted that the semi-classical approximation is valid in the systems of
physical interest including the early stage of heavy-ion collisions. Using a
product ansatz for the Husimi function, which is confirmed to reproduce the HW
entropy within 20% error (overestimate) for a few-body quantum system, we
succeed in a numerical evaluation of HW entropy of YM fields and show that it
surely has a finite value and increases in time.

the key features of multiplier Hopf algebras (over fields) remain valid in this
more general context. Namely, for a multiplier Hopf monoid A, the existence of
a unique antipode is proved --- in an appropriate, multiplier-valued sense ---
which is shown to be a morphism of multiplier bimonoids from a twisted version
of A to A. For a regular multiplier Hopf monoid (whose twisted versions are
multiplier Hopf monoids as well) the antipode is proved to factorize through a
proper automorphism of the object A. Under mild further assumptions, duals in
the base category are shown to lift to the monoidal categories of modules and
of comodules over a regular multiplier Hopf monoid. Finally, the so-called
Fundamental Theorem of Hopf modules is proved --- which states an equivalence
between the base category and the category of Hopf modules over a multiplier

using the different ways from Hirayama \cite{Hirayama}. Furthermore, we prove
the nonsqueezing property of the periodic higher-order KdV-type equation as
well. The proof relies on Gromov's nonsqueezing theorem for the finite
dimensional Hamiltonian system and approximation for the solution flow. More
precisely, after taking the frequency truncation to the solution flow, we
applied the nonsqueezing theorem and then the result is transferred to the
infinite dimensional original flow. This argument was introduced by Kuksin
\cite{Kuksin:1995ue} and made concretely by Bourgain \cite{Bourgain:1994tr} for
1D cubic NLS flow, and Colliander et. al. \cite{CKSTT3} for the KdV flow. One
of our observation is that the higher-order KdV-type equation has the better
modulation effect from the non-resonant interaction than KdV equation. Hence,
unlike the work of Colliander et. al. \cite{CKSTT3}, we can get the

Based on a physically motivated channel model, we first establish a
relationship between channel space-frequency correlations and the channel power
angle-delay spectrum in the massive antenna array regime, which reveals the
channel sparsity in massive MIMO-OFDM. With this channel model, we then
investigate channel acquisition, including channel estimation and channel
prediction, for massive MIMO-OFDM with APSPs. We show that channel acquisition
performance in terms of sum mean square error can be minimized if the user
terminals' channel power distributions in the angle-delay domain can be made
non-overlapping with proper phase shift scheduling. A simplified pilot phase
shift scheduling algorithm is developed based on this optimal channel
acquisition condition. The performance of APSPs is investigated for both one
symbol and multiple symbol data models. Simulations demonstrate that the
proposed APSP approach can provide substantial performance gains in terms of
achievable spectral efficiency over the conventional phase shift orthogonal
pilot approach in typical mobility scenarios.

mean-field using a set of independent mean-field trajectories with appropriate
choice of fluctuating initial conditions. We show here, that this approach is
equivalent to a simplified version of the Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon
(BBGKY) hierarchy between one-, two-, ..., N-body degrees of freedom. In this
simplified version, one-body degrees of freedom are coupled to fluctuations to
all orders while retaining only specific terms of the general BBGKY hierarchy.
The use of the simplified BBGKY is illustrated with the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
(LMG) model. We show that a truncated version of this hierarchy can be useful,
as an alternative to the SMF, especially in the weak coupling regime to get
physical insight in the effect beyond mean-field. In particular, it leads to
approximate analytical expressions for the quantum fluctuations both in the
weak and strong coupling regime. In the strong coupling regime, it can only be
used for short time evolution. In that case, it gives information on the
evolution time-scale close to a saddle point associated to a quantum
phase-transition. For long time evolution and strong coupling, we observed that
the simplified BBGKY hierarchy cannot be truncated and only the full SMF with
initial sampling leads to reasonable results.

Extensive efforts have been made to identify the origin of the neutrino flux

perspectives. In addition, the search for neutrino fluxes beyond the observed
level has become increasingly important for further understanding the origin of
the observed cosmic-ray up to $10^{20}$ eV. Although the IceCube Neutrino
Observatory is the only experiment currently measuring this neutrino flux, its
initial measurements have been confirmed via analysis using several independent
detection channels. Further, there have been a number of developments in the
search for neutrino point sources, while no successful observations have yet
been reported. Following the IceCube observations, a large number of studies of
next-generation neutrino detectors, including up-scaled underground Cherenkov

incoherent heat fluxes that make no net contribution to heat transport, and at
the same time to \textit{increase} the coherency of temperature and velocity
fields. The suppression of small-scale turbulent fluctuations leads to more
coherent thermal plumes that result in the heat transport enhancement. The fact
that polymer additives can increase the coherency of thermal plumes is
supported by the measurements of a number of local quantities, such as the
extracted plume amplitude and width, the velocity autocorrelation functions and
the velocity-temperature cross-correlation coefficient. The results from local
measurements also suggest the existence of a threshold value for the polymer
concentration, only above which can significant modification of the plume

Estimation of the plume emission rate suggests that the second effect of

and with significantly lower values of the dipolar magnetic field than the
average radio-pulsar population has motivated a lively debate about their
formation and origin, with controversial interpretations. A possible
explanation requires the slow rotation of the proto-neutron star at birth,
which is unable to amplify its magnetic field to typical pulsar levels. An
alternative possibility, the hidden magnetic field scenario, considers the
accretion of the fallback of the supernova debris onto the neutron star as
responsible for the submergence (or screening) of the field and its apparently
low value. In this paper we study under which conditions the magnetic field of
a neutron star can be buried into the crust due to an accreting, conducting
fluid. For this purpose, we consider a spherically symmetric calculation in
general relativity to estimate the balance between the incoming accretion flow
and the magnetosphere. Our study analyses several models with different
specific entropy, composition, and neutron star masses. The main conclusion of
our work is that typical magnetic fields of a few times 1e12 G can be buried by
accreting only 1e-3 - 1e-2 solar mass, a relatively modest amount of mass. In
view of this result, the Central Compact Object scenario should not be
considered unusual, and we predict that anomalously weak magnetic fields should
be common in very young (< few kyr) neutron stars.

varying the laser intensity and the cell thickness from $L = \lambda / 2$ to $L

absorption spectrum is observed for $L = \lambda/2$ ($\sim \unit[120]{ MHz}$ at

characteristics of capital importance in photonics. This kind of two-phase

determine the properties of the glass-ceramic. Among these properties
transparency is crucial, in particular when confined structures, such as
dielectric optical waveguides and optical fibers, are considered, and the
number of papers devoted to this topic is continuously increasing. Another
important point is the role of the nanocrystals when activated by luminescent
species, as rare earth ions, and their effect on the spectroscopic properties
of the glass-ceramic. The presence of the crystalline environment around the
rare earth ion allows high absorption and emission cross sections, reduction of
the non-radiative relaxation thanks to the lower phonon cutoff energy, and
tailoring of the ion-ion interaction by the control of the rare earth ion
partition. This last point is crucial and still object of intense experimental
and theoretical studies. The composition of the glass matrix also impacts the
properties of the rare earth ions located in nanoparticles. Moreover, some
kinds of nanocrystals can play as effective rare earth sensitizers.

measurements. As a first con- tribution, it is shown that, under a quantum
nondemolition measurement scheme applied to a system initially at the ground
state, (i) the observed sequence of measurements (quantum tracks) corresponding
to a single experiment converges to a limit point, and that (ii) the limit
point is random over the ensemble of the experiments, being distributed as a
zero-mean Gaussian random variable with a variance at most equal to the
ground-state variance. As a second contribution, the richer scenario where the
oscillator is coupled with a frozen (i.e., at the ground state) ensemble of
independent quantum oscillators is considered. A sharply different behavior
emerges: under the same measurement scheme, here we observe that the
measurement sequences are essentially divergent. Such a rigorous statistical
analysis of the sequential measurement process might be useful for
characterizing the main quantities that are currently used for inference,
manipulation, and monitoring of many quantum systems. Several interesting
properties of the quantum tracks evolution, as well as of the associated
(quantum) threshold crossing times, are discussed and the dependence upon the
main system parameters (e.g., the choice of the measurement sampling time, the
degree of interaction with the environment, the measurement device accuracy) is
elucidated. At a more fundamental level, it is seen that, as an application of
basic quantum mechanics principles, a sharp difference exists between the
intrinsic randomness unavoidably present in any quantum system, and the
extrinsic randomness arising from the environmental coupling, i.e., the
randomness induced by an external source of disturbance.

plays an important role in mirror symmetry for Calabi--Yau varieties. A
horospherical $G$-variety of complexity one is a normal $G$-variety which is
equivariantly birational to a product $C \times G/H$, where $C$ is a smooth
projective curve and the closed subgroup $H$ contains a maximal unipotent
subgroup of $G$. The simplest example of such a variety is a normal surface
with a non-trivial $\mathbb{C}^{\star}$-action. Our formula extends the results

The proof involves the study of the arc space of a horospherical variety of

[BM13], the number of orbits is no longer countable, which adds significant
difficulties to the problem. As a corollary of our main theorem, we obtain a

retrieval. However, most existing hashing methods are based on hand-crafted
features which might not be optimally compatible with the hashing procedure.
Recently, deep hashing methods have been proposed to perform simultaneous
feature learning and hash-code learning with deep neural networks, which have
shown better performance than traditional hashing methods with hand-crafted
features. Most of these deep hashing methods are supervised whose supervised
information is given with triplet labels. For another common application
scenario with pairwise labels, there have not existed methods for simultaneous
feature learning and hash-code learning. In this paper, we propose a novel deep
hashing method, called deep pairwise-supervised hashing(DPSH), to perform
simultaneous feature learning and hash-code learning for applications with
pairwise labels. Experiments on real datasets show that our DPSH method can
outperform other methods to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image
retrieval applications.

compositions of Mg-rich olivines found in diogenites. The liquidus of a mantle
with Mg# (=100*(Mg/(Mg+Fe))) 80 is ~1625oC and, under equilibrium conditions
the melt crystallises olivine alone until it is joined by orthopyroxene at
1350oC. We synthesized melt from our 1350oC experiment and simulated its
fractional crystallization path. Orthopyroxene crystallizes until it is
replaced by pigeonite at 1200oC. Liquids become eucritic and crystal
assemblages resemble diogenites below 1250oC. MELTS correctly predicts the
olivine liquidus but overestimates the orthopyroxene liquidus by ~70oC.
Predicted melt compositions are in reasonable agreement with those generated
experimentally. We used MELTS to determine that the range of mantle

information of the cluster structure of the $^{20}$Ne nucleus in its ground
state through the cross section of the $\alpha$-transfer reaction
$^{16}$O($^6$Li,~$d$)$^{20}$Ne. For the analysis of the transfer reaction, we
work with the coupled-channel Born approximation (CCBA) approach, in which the
breakup effect of $^6$Li is explicitly taken into account by means of the
continuum-discretized coupled-channel method based on the three-body $\alpha +
d + {}^{16}$O model. The two methods are adopted to calculate the overlap
function between $^{20}$Ne and $\alpha + {}^{16}$O; one is the microscopic
cluster model (MCM) with the generator coordinate method, and the other is the
phenomenological two-body potential model (PM). We show that the CCBA
calculation with the MCM wave function gives a significant improvement of the
theoretical result on the angular distribution of the transfer cross section,
which is consistent with the experimental data. Employing the PM, it is
discussed which region of the cluster wave function is probed on the transfer
cross section. It is found that the surface region of the cluster wave function
is sensitive to the cross section. The present work is situated as the first
step in obtaining important information to systematically investigate the

is by penalized likelihood maximization, where the smoothing parameters
controlling the extent of penalization are estimated by Laplace approximate

that is twice as fast as without it, on average. Thus the internal state of
discrete-time quantum walks holds valuable information that can be utilized to
improve algorithms. Furthermore, we determine conditions for which spatial

also polarizes over finite fields. With it the direct encoding of q-ary sources

algorithms. However, direct polar decoding of q-ary sources and channels is
more involved. In this paper we obtain a recursive equation for the likelihood
ratio expressed as a LR vector. With it successive cancellation (SC) decoding
is applied in a straightforward way. The complexity is quadratic in the order
of the field, but the use of the LR vector introduces factors that soften that
complexity. We also show that operations can be parallelized in the decoder.
The Bhattacharyya parameters are expressed as a function of the LR vectors, as
in the binary case, simplifying the construction of the codes. We have applied
direct polar coding to several sources and channels and we have compared it
with other multilevel strategies. The direct q-ary polar coding is closer to
the theoretical limit than other techniques when the alphabet size is large.
Our results suggest that direct q-ary polar coding could be used in real

the homotopy continuation concept [6] that transforms optimal quadrature rules
from source spaces to target spaces, we derive optimal rules for splines
generated above finite domains. Starting with the classical Gaussian quadrature
for polynomials, which is an optimal rule for a discontinuous odd-degree space,
we derive rules for target spaces of higher continuity. We further show how the
homotopy methodology handles cases where the source and target rules require
different numbers of optimal quadrature points. We demonstrate it by deriving
optimal rules for various odd-degree spline spaces, particularly with
non-uniform knot sequences and non-uniform multiplicities. We also discuss
convergence of our rules to their asymptotic counterparts, that is, the
analogues of the midpoint rule of Hughes et al. [34], that are exact and
optimal for infinite domains. For spaces of low continuities, we numerically
show that the derived rules quickly converge to their asymptotic counterparts
as the weights and nodes of a few boundary elements differ from the asymptotic

the added OpenMP directives yield an additional 5-16\% speedup. We also
identify further code optimisations which could yield yet greater improvement

the investment of months in analysis and optimisation has yielded performance
gains that correspond to the saving of tens of millions of core-hours on

In
pebble accretion, gravity and gas drag conspire to yield large collisional
cross sections for small particles in protoplanetary disks. However, before
pebble accretion commences, aerodynamical deflection may act to prevent
planetesimals from becoming large, because particles tend to follow gas
streamlines. We derive the planetesimal radius where pebble accretion is
initiated and determine the growth timescales of planetesimals by sweepup of
small particles. We obtain the collision efficiency factor as the ratio of the
numerically-obtained collisional cross section to the planetesimal surface
area, from which we obtain the growth timescales. Integrations are conducted in
the potential flow limit (steady, inviscid) and in the Stokes flow regime
(steady, viscid). Only particles of stopping time $t_s \ll t_X$ where
$t_X\approx10^3$ s experience aerodynamic deflection. Even in that case, the
planetesimal's gravity always ensures positive collision factors. The maximum
growth timescale occurs typically at around $R\approx100 \ \mathrm{km}$, but is
less for colder disks, corresponding to interactions shifting to the Safronov
focusing regime. For particles $t_s \gg t_X$ pebble accretion commences only
after this phase and is characterized by a steep drop in growth timescales.
Consequently, at distances beyond ~10 AU sweepup growth timescales are always
longer than $10$ Myr, while in the inner disk (~<3 AU) the viability of the
sweepup scenario is determined by the outcome of pebble-planetesimal collisions
in the geometric regime. We present analytical fits for the collision
efficiency factors and the minimum planetesimal size needed for pebble
accretion. (Abridged)

speedups in quantum optimization via quantum annealing (QA), especially for
problems featuring a cost function with tall and thin barriers. We present and
analyze several counterexamples from the class of perturbed Hamming-weight
optimization problems with qubit permutation symmetry. We first show that, for
these problems, the adiabatic dynamics that make tunneling possible should be
understood not in terms of the cost function but rather the semi-classical
potential arising from the spin-coherent path integral formalism. We then
provide an example where the shape of the barrier in the final cost function is
short and wide, which might suggest no quantum advantage for QA, yet where
tunneling renders QA superior to simulated annealing in the adiabatic regime.
However, the adiabatic dynamics turn out not be optimal. Instead, an evolution
involving a sequence of diabatic transitions through many avoided
level-crossings, involving no tunneling, is optimal and outperforms adiabatic
QA. We show that this phenomenon of speedup by diabatic transitions is not
unique to this example, and we provide an example where it provides an
exponential speedup over adiabatic QA. In yet another twist, we show that a
classical algorithm, spin vector dynamics, is at least as efficient as diabatic
QA. Finally, in a different example with a convex cost function, the diabatic
transitions result in a speedup relative to both adiabatic QA with tunneling
and classical spin vector dynamics.

assumptions of the model. Tumor volume is composed of proliferating (or
dividing) cancer cells and non-dividing (or dead) cells. Tumor growth rate (or
tumor volume doubling time, Td) is proportional to the ratio of the volumes of
tumor vasculature and the tumor. The vascular volume grows slower than the
tumor by introducing the vascular growth retardation factor, theta. Upon
irradiation the proliferating cells gradually die over a fixed time period
after irradiation. Dead cells are cleared away with cell clearance time, Tcl.
The model was applied to simulate pre-treatment growth and post-treatment
radiation response of rat rhabdomyosarcoma tumor and metastatic brain tumors of
five patients who were treated by Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery

the system. Here the representation formula is used to get an asymptotic
expansion of respectively velocity and its gradient, and to establish pointwise
decay estimates of remainder terms. Our results are based on a fundamental

that the emission of bremsstrahlung radiation leads to non-monotonic features
in the electron distribution function and describe how the simultaneous
inclusion of synchrotron and bremsstrahlung radiation losses affects the
dynamics of fast electrons. We give quantitative expressions for (1) the
maximum electron energy attainable in the presence of bremsstrahlung losses and
(2) when bremsstrahlung radiation losses are expected to have a stronger effect

that, in typical tokamak scenarios, synchrotron radiation losses will dominate

The aim of this work is the study of abundances of the heavy elements
Ba, La, Ce, Nd, and Eu in 56 bulge giants (red giant branch and red clump) with
metallicities ranging from -1.3 dex to 0.5 dex. Methods. We obtained
high-resolution spectra of our giant stars using the FLAMES-UVES spectrograph
on the Very Large Telescope. We inspected four bulge fields along the minor
axis. Results. We measure the chemical evolution of heavy elements, as a
function of metallicity, in the Galactic bulge. Conclusions. The [Ba, La, Ce,
Nd/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] ratios decrease with increasing metallicity, in which aspect
they differ from disc stars. In our metal-poor bulge stars, La and Ba are
enhanced relative to their thick disc counterpart, while in our metal-rich
bulge stars La and Ba are underabundant relative to their disc counterpart.
Therefore, this contrast between bulge and discs trends indicates that bulge
and (solar neighbourhood) thick disc stars could behave differently. An
increase in [La, Nd/Eu] with increasing metallicity, for metal-rich stars with
[Fe/H] > 0 dex, may indicate that the s-process from AGB stars starts to
operate at a metallicity around solar. Finally, [Eu/Fe] follows the
[{\alpha}/Fe] behaviour, as expected, since these elements are produced by SNe
type II.

well. In this setting, we can explicitly see the influence of the correlations

multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising technique for dynamic spectrum access.
However, the out-of-band (OOB) power radiation of OFDM introduces significant
interference to the adjacent users. This problem is serious in cognitive radio
(CR) networks, which enables the secondary system to access the instantaneous
spectrum hole. Existing methods either do not effectively reduce the OOB power
leakage or introduce significant bit-error-rate (BER) performance deterioration
in the receiver. In this paper, a joint spectral precoding (JSP) scheme is
developed for OOB power reduction by the matrix operations of orthogonal
projection and singular value decomposition (SVD). We also propose an algorithm
to design the precoding matrix under receive performance constraint, which is
converted to matrix condition number constraint in practice. This method well
achieves the desirable spectrum envelope and receive performance by selecting
zero-forcing frequencies. Simulation results show that the OOB power decreases
significantly by the proposed scheme under condition number constraint.

resulting in significantly larger load reductions compared to those achieved
with conventional delivery schemes. However, prior work does not exploit the
properties of video and simply treats content as fixed-size files that users
would like to fully download. Our work is motivated by the fact that video can
be coded in a scalable fashion and that the decoded video quality depends on
the number of layers a user is able to receive. Using a Gaussian source model,

equations in two-dimensional unbounded domains. First, the main results on the
construction of the weak solutions and on their asymptotic behavior are
reviewed and structured so that all the cases can be treated in one concise
way. Most of the open problems are linked with the case of a vanishing velocity
field at infinity and this will be the main subject of the remainder of this
study. The linearization of the Navier-Stokes around the zero solution leads to
the Stokes equations which are ill-posed in two dimensions. It is the
well-known Stokes paradox which states that if the net force is nonzero, the
solution of the Stokes equations will grow at infinity. By studying the link
between the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, it is proven that even if the
net force vanishes, the velocity and pressure fields of the Navier-Stokes
equations cannot be asymptotic to those of the Stokes equations. However, the
velocity field can be in some cases asymptotic to two exact solutions of the
Stokes equations which also solve the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, a
formal asymptotic expansion at infinity for the solutions of the
two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations having a nonzero net force is
established based physical arguments. The leading term of the velocity field in
this expansion decays like $|\boldsymbol{x}|^{-1/3}$ and exhibits a wake
behavior. Numerical simulations are performed to validate this asymptotic
expansion when is net force is nonzero and to analyze the asymptotic behavior
in the case where the net force is vanishing. This indicates that the
Navier-Stokes equations admit solutions whose velocity field goes to zero at
infinity in contrast to the Stokes linearization and moreover this shows that
the set of possible asymptotes is very rich.

universe, where the entropy can be considered to behave as if it were related
to the exchange (the transfer) of energy. To discuss this exchangeability, the
consistency of the two continuity equations obtained from two different methods
is examined, focusing on a homogeneous, isotropic, spatially flat, and
matter-dominated universe. The first continuity equation is derived from the
first law of thermodynamics, whereas the second equation is from the Friedmann
and acceleration equations. To study the influence of forms of entropy on the
consistency, a phenomenological entropic-force model is examined, using a
general form of entropy proportional to the $n$-th power of the Hubble horizon.
In this formulation, the Bekenstein entropy (an area entropy), the
Tsallis--Cirto black-hole entropy (a volume entropy), and a quartic entropy are
represented by $n=2$, $3$, and $4$, respectively. The two continuity equations
for the present model are found to be consistent with each other, especially
when $n=2$, i.e., the Bekenstein entropy. The exchange of energy between the
bulk (the universe) and the boundary (the horizon of the universe) should be a
viable scenario consistent with the holographic principle.

accompanied by an electric current. The closing of the electric current occurs
in the crust of a neutron stars in the polar region across the magnetic field.
But the conductivity of the crust along the magnetic field greatly exceeds the
conductivity across the field, so the current penetrates deep into the crust
down up to the super conducting core. The magnetic field, generated by the
accretion current, increases greatly with the depth of penetration due to the
Hall conductivity of the crust is also much larger than the transverse
conductivity. As a result, the current begins to flow mainly in the toroidal
direction, creating a strong longitudinal magnetic field, far exceeding an
initial dipole field. This field exists only in the narrow polar tube of $r$
width, narrowing with the depth, i.e. with increasing of the crust density
$\rho$, $r\propto \rho^{-1/4}$. Accordingly, the magnetic field $B$ in the tube
increases with the depth, $B\propto \rho^{1/2}$, and reaches the value of about
$10^{17}$ Gauss in the core. It destroys super conducting vortices in the core
of a star in the narrow region of the size of the order of ten centimeters.
Because of generated density gradient of vortices they constantly flow into
this dead zone and the number of vortices decreases, the magnetic field of a
star decreases as well. The attenuation of the magnetic field is exponential,
$B=B_0(1+t/\tau)^{-1}$. The characteristic time of decreasing of the magnetic
field $\tau$ is equal to $\tau\simeq 10^3$ years. Thus, the magnetic field of

describes the extension, torque and supercoiling in single, stretched and
twisted DNA molecules, which consists of a mixture of extended and supercoiled
state, using now a more accurate form of the free energy for the untwisted but
stretched DNA. The original model uses an approximate form of this free energy
and the agreement with experiment is only qualitative. We find that this more
accurate free energy significantly improves the results, bring them into
quantitative agreement with experiment, throughout the entire force regime.
This is rather surprising, considering that the theory is completely
parameter-free.
