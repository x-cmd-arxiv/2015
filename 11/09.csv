variable into a Gaussian one. This transform is important and appealing, as it
is easy to compute, and becomes handy in various inverse problems with Poisson
noise contamination. Solution to such problems can be done by first applying
the Anscombe transform, then applying a Gaussian-noise-oriented restoration
algorithm of choice, and finally applying an inverse Anscombe transform. The
appeal in this approach is due to the abundance of high-performance restoration
algorithms designed for white additive Gaussian noise (we will refer to these
hereafter as ""Gaussian-solvers""). This process is known to work well for high
SNR images, where the Anscombe transform provides a rather accurate
approximation. When the noise level is high, the above path loses much of its
effectiveness, and the common practice is to replace it with a direct treatment
of the Poisson distribution. Naturally, with this we lose the ability to
leverage on vastly available Gaussian-solvers.
  In this work we suggest a novel method for coupling Gaussian denoising
algorithms to Poisson noisy inverse problems, which is based on a general
approach termed ""Plug-and-Play"". Deploying the Plug-and-Play approach to such
problems leads to an iterative scheme that repeats several key steps: 1) A
convex programming task of simple form that can be easily treated; 2) A
powerful Gaussian denoising algorithm of choice; and 3) A simple update step.
  Such a modular method, just like the Anscombe transform, enables other
developers to plug their own Gaussian denoising algorithms to our scheme in an
easy way. While the proposed method bares some similarity to the Anscombe
operation, it is in fact based on a different mathematical basis, which holds
true for all SNR ranges.

\emph{ii}) the complex equilibria regulating the MACC speciation after

to untangle the complex structure of electrolytes, ionic liquids and other
liquid media is presented. The analysis of formation energies and
grand-potential phase diagrams of Mg-Al-Cl-THF suggests that the MACC
electrolyte bears a simple chemical structure with few simple constituents,
namely the electro-active species MgCl$^+$ and AlCl$_4^-$ in equilibrium with
MgCl$_2$ and AlCl$_3$. Knowledge of the stable species of the MACC electrolyte
allows us to determine the most important equilibria occurring during
electrochemical cycling. We observe that Al deposition is always preferred to
Mg deposition, explaining why freshly synthesized MACC cannot operate and needs
to undergo preparatory conditioning. Similarly, we suggest that aluminum
displacement and depletion from the solution upon electrolyte resting (along
with continuous MgCl$_2$ regeneration) represents one of the causes of
electrolyte aging. Finally, we compute the NMR shifts from shielding tensors of

division and generating cell diversity during development. Proper position in
the single-cell embryo of Caenorhabditis elegans is achieved initially by the
migration and rotation of the pronuclear complex (PNC) and its two associated
centrosomal arrays of microtubules (MTs). We present here the first systematic
theoretical study of how these $O(1000)$ centrosomal microtubules (MTs)
interact through the immersing cytoplasm, the cell periphery and PNC, and with
each other, to achieve proper position. This study is made possible through our
development of a highly efficient and parallelized computational framework that
accounts explicitly for long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) between the
MTs, while also capturing their flexibility, dynamic instability, and
interactions with molecular motors and boundaries. First, we show through
direct simulation that previous estimates of the PNC drag coefficient, based on
either ignoring or partially including HIs, lead to misprediction of the active
forces and time-scales of migration. We then directly study the dynamics of PNC
migration under various force-transduction models, including the pushing or
pulling of MTs at the cortex, and the pulling of MTs by cytoplasmically-bound
force generators. While achieving proper position and orientation on
physiologically reasonable time-scales does not uniquely choose a model, we
find that each model produces a different signature in its induced cytoplasmic
flow and MT conformations. We suggest then that cytoplasmic flows and MT
conformations can be used to differentiate between mechanisms and to determine
their contribution to the migration process.

additional variable related to the angle between the two pions. In particular,
we realize that not all invariant amplitudes in the underlying correlation
function can be used, some of them generating kinematical singularities in the
dispersion relation. The two sum rules that are free from these ambiguities are
obtained in the leading twist-2 approximation, predicting the $\bar{B}^0\to

axial $b\to u$ current, respectively. We calculate these form factors at the
momentum transfers $0<q^2\lesssim 12 $ GeV$^2$ and at the dipion mass close to
the threshold $4m_\pi^2$. The sum rule results indicate that the contributions
of the higher partial waves to the form factors are suppressed with respect to
the lowest $P$-wave contribution and that the latter is not completely

to ask about a dataset often depends on previous interactions with the same
dataset. However, statistical validity is typically studied in a nonadaptive
model, where all questions are specified before the dataset is drawn. Recent
work by Dwork et al. (STOC, 2015) and Hardt and Ullman (FOCS, 2014) initiated
the formal study of this problem, and gave the first upper and lower bounds on
the achievable generalization error for adaptive data analysis.
  Specifically, suppose there is an unknown distribution $\mathbf{P}$ and a set
of $n$ independent samples $\mathbf{x}$ is drawn from $\mathbf{P}$. We seek an
algorithm that, given $\mathbf{x}$ as input, accurately answers a sequence of
adaptively chosen queries about the unknown distribution $\mathbf{P}$. How many
samples $n$ must we draw from the distribution, as a function of the type of
queries, the number of queries, and the desired level of accuracy?
  In this work we make two new contributions:
  (i) We give upper bounds on the number of samples $n$ that are needed to
answer statistical queries. The bounds improve and simplify the work of Dwork
et al. (STOC, 2015), and have been applied in subsequent work by those authors
(Science, 2015, NIPS, 2015).
  (ii) We prove the first upper bounds on the number of samples required to
answer more general families of queries. These include arbitrary
low-sensitivity queries and an important class of optimization queries.
  As in Dwork et al., our algorithms are based on a connection with algorithmic
stability in the form of differential privacy. We extend their work by giving a
quantitatively optimal, more general, and simpler proof of their main theorem
that stability implies low generalization error. We also study weaker stability

visual representation of the possible inertias of a given graph. The inertia of
a graph counts the number of real positive and negative eigenvalues of its
corresponding adjacency matrix. The problem of studying inertia tables is
directly related to the inverse eigenvalue problem and can be used as a tool
for the minimum rank problem. This paper describes the inverse eigenvalue
problem, and tools used. We describe a number of new general formulas for
various simple undirected graphs and improved upon an established notation for

spectroscopic campaign provided more than 4000 reliable redshifts, including
~800 cluster member galaxies. The unprecedented sample of cluster members at
this redshift allows us to perform a highly detailed dynamical and structural
analysis of the cluster out to ~2.2$r_{200}$ (~4Mpc). Our analysis of
substructures reveals a complex system composed of a main massive cluster
($M_{200}$~0.9$\times 10^{15} M_{\odot}$) presenting two major features: i) a
bimodal velocity distribution, showing two central peaks separated by $\Delta
V_{rf}$~1100 km s$^{-1}$ with comparable galaxy content and velocity
dispersion, ii) a projected elongation of the main substructures along the
NE-SW direction, with a prominent subclump ~600 kpc SW of the center and an
isolated BCG approximately halfway between the center and the SW clump. We also
detect a low mass structure at z~0.390, ~10' S of the cluster center, projected
at ~3Mpc, with a relative line-of-sight velocity of $\Delta V_{rf}$~-1700 km
s$^{-1}$. The cluster mass profile that we obtain through our dynamical
analysis deviates significantly from the ""universal"" NFW, being best fit by a
Softened Isothermal Sphere model instead. The mass profile measured from the
galaxy dynamics is found to be in relatively good agreement with those obtained
from strong and weak lensing, as well as with that from the X-rays, despite the
clearly unrelaxed nature of the cluster. Our results reveal overall a complex
dynamical state of this massive cluster and support the hypothesis that the two
main subclusters are being observed in a pre-collisional phase, in line with
recent findings from radio and deep X-ray data. With this article we also
release the entire redshift catalog of 4386 sources in the field of this
cluster.

kernel method, along with a rigorous computer algebra approach, to show that 23
of the 79 models admit D-finite generating functions. In 2009, Bostan and
Kauers used Pad\'e-Hermite approximants to guess differential equations which
these 23 generating functions satisfy, in the process guessing asymptotics of
their coefficient sequences. In this article we provide, for the first time, a
complete rigorous verification of these guesses. Our technique is to use the
kernel method to express 19 of the 23 generating functions as diagonals of
tri-variate rational functions and apply the methods of analytic combinatorics
in several variables (the remaining 4 models have algebraic generating
functions and can thus be handled by univariate techniques). This approach also
shows the link between combinatorial properties of the models and features of
its asymptotics such as asymptotic and polynomial growth factors. In addition,
we give expressions for the number of walks returning to the x-axis, the
y-axis, and the origin, proving recently conjectured asymptotics of Bostan,

the lessons learned from making formal methods for the verification and
analysis of realistic systems. Examples are:
  (1) Which formalism is chosen, and why?
  (2) Which abstractions have to be made and why?
  (3) How are important characteristics of the system modelled?
  (4) Were there any complications while modelling the system?
  (5) Which measures were taken to guarantee the accuracy of the model?
  We invited papers that present full models of real systems, which may lay the
basis for future comparison and analysis. An aim of the workshop is to present
different modelling approaches and discuss pros and cons for each of them.
Alternative formal descriptions of the systems presented at this workshop are
encouraged, which should foster the development of improved specification

phase where invertible sequent rules are applied exhaustively and a chaining
phase where it selects a formula and decomposes it maximally using
non-invertible rules. Focusing is one of the most exciting recent developments
in computational logic: it is complete for many logics of interest and provides
a foundation for their use as programming languages and rewriting calculi.

mean-field approximations as well as multi-variable variational Monte Carlo
(MVMC) methods for Dirac electrons on honeycomb lattices. The topological
insulator phases predicted in the previous studies by the mean-field
approximation for an extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice turn out
to disappear, when we consider the possibility of a long-period
charge-density-wave (CDW) order taking over the TMI phase. Nevertheless, we
further show that the TMI phase is still stabilized when we are able to tune
the Fermi velocity of the Dirac point of the electron band. Beyond the
limitation of the mean-field calculation, we apply the newly developed MVMC to
make accurate predictions after including the many-body and quantum
fluctuations. By taking the extrapolation to the thermodynamic and weak
external field limit, we present realistic criteria for the emergence of the
topological insulator caused by the electron correlations. By suppressing the
Fermi velocity to a tenth of that of the original honeycomb lattice, the
topological insulator emerges in an extended region as a spontaneous symmetry
breaking surviving competitions with other orders. We discuss experimental ways
to realize it in a bilayer graphenesystem.

complementary window to light curves and spectra for studying these enigmatic

near-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf star in a
""delayed-detonation"". We calculate a three-dimensional hydrodynamic explosion
for the N100 delayed-detonation model extensively discussed in the literature,
taking the dynamical effects of neutrino emission from all important
contributing source terms into account. Although neutrinos carry away $2 \times
10^{49}$ erg of energy, we confirm the common view that neutrino energy losses
are dynamically not very important, resulting in only a modest reduction of the
final kinetic energy by two per cent. We then calculate the gravitational wave
signal from the time evolution of the quadrupole moment. Our model radiates $7
\times 10^{39}$ erg in gravitational waves and the spectrum has a pronounced
peak around 0.4 Hz. Depending on viewing angle and polarization, we find that
the future space-based gravitational wave missions DECIGO and BBO would be able
to detect our source to a distance of 1.3 Mpc. We predict a clear signature of
the deflagration-to-detonation transition in the neutrino and the gravitational

common signals of sentiment expression on social media the relationship between
emoticons and sentiment polarity are not always clear. Thus, any algorithm that
deals with sentiment polarity should take emoticons into account but extreme
cau- tion should be exercised in which emoticons to depend on. First, to
demonstrate the prevalence of emoticons on social media, we analyzed the
frequency of emoticons in a large re- cent Twitter data set. Then we carried
out four analyses to examine the relationship between emoticons and sentiment
polarity as well as the contexts in which emoticons are used. The first
analysis surveyed a group of participants for their perceived sentiment
polarity of the most frequent emoticons. The second analysis examined
clustering of words and emoti- cons to better understand the meaning conveyed
by the emoti- cons. The third analysis compared the sentiment polarity of
microblog posts before and after emoticons were removed from the text. The last
analysis tested the hypothesis that removing emoticons from text hurts
sentiment classification by training two machine learning models with and
without emoticons in the text respectively. The results confirms the arguments
that: 1) a few emoticons are strong and reliable signals of sentiment polarity
and one should take advantage of them in any senti- ment analysis; 2) a large
group of the emoticons conveys com- plicated sentiment hence they should be
treated with extreme caution.

  Distributions",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well-known that many networks follow a power-law degree distribution;
however, the factors that influence the formation of their distributions are
still unclear. How can one model the connection between individual actions and
network distributions? How can one explain the formation of group phenomena and
their evolutionary patterns?
  In this paper, we propose a unified framework, M3D, to model human dynamics
in social networks from three perspectives: macro, meso, and micro. At the
micro-level, we seek to capture the way in which an individual user decides
whether to perform an action. At the meso-level, we study how group behavior
develops and evolves over time, based on individual actions. At the
macro-level, we try to understand how network distributions such as power-law
(or heavy-tailed phenomena) can be explained by group behavior. We provide
theoretical analysis for the proposed framework, and discuss the connection of
our framework with existing work.
  The framework offers a new, flexible way to explain the interplay between
individual user actions and network distributions, and can benefit many
applications. To model heavy-tailed distributions from partially observed
individual actions and to predict the formation of group behaviors, we apply
M3D to three different genres of networks: Tencent Weibo, Citation, and Flickr.
We also use information-burst prediction as a particular application to
quantitatively evaluate the predictive power of the proposed framework. Our
results on the Weibo indicate that M3D's prediction performance exceeds that of
several alternative methods by up to 30\%.

interaction effects, they can have a positive chemical potential and therefore
behave similarly to non-relativistic bosons. Relevant properties of this dense

rather general grounds from Maxwell's relation.

uniformly distributed at random over the network area. We let each node with
storage capacity $M$ cache files from a library of size $m \geq M$. Each node
in the network requests a file from the library independently at random,
according to a popularity distribution, and is served by other nodes having the
requested file in their local cache via (possibly) multihop transmissions.
Under the classical ""protocol model"" of wireless networks, we characterize the
optimal per-node capacity scaling law for a broad class of heavy-tailed
popularity distributions including Zipf distributions with exponent less than
one. In the parameter regimes of interest, we show that a decentralized random
caching strategy with uniform probability over the library yields the optimal
per-node capacity scaling of $\Theta(\sqrt{M/m})$, which is constant with $n$,
thus yielding throughput scalability with the network size. Furthermore, the
multihop capacity scaling can be significantly better than for the case of
single-hop caching networks, for which the per-node capacity is $\Theta(M/m)$.
The multihop capacity scaling law can be further improved for a Zipf
distribution with exponent larger than some threshold $> 1$, by using a
decentralized random caching uniformly across a subset of most popular files in
the library. Namely, ignoring a subset of less popular files (i.e., effectively
reducing the size of the library) can significantly improve the throughput
scaling while guaranteeing that all nodes will be served with high probability
as $n$ increases.

the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase. In particular situations, the
BKT phase exists as an intermediate temperature phase. There have been
scenarios for the phase transitions at the two endpoints of the intermediate
BKT phase, i.e., the phase transition at the low-temperature endpoint is a BKT
transition and that at the high-temperature endpoint is either a BKT transition
or a first-order transition. The present study gives a novel scenario, i.e., a
second-order transition with a new critical universality and a BKT transition.
We found that this new phase transition is realized in spin-crossover systems
on a triangular lattice with an antiferromagnetic short-range interaction. At
the low-temperature transition the elastic interaction plays as a ferromagnetic
infinite-range interaction and encourages the breaking of $Z_2$ symmetry
between high-spin rich and low-spin rich states.

Network (MIN), which can enhance model discriminability and facilitate the
process of information abstraction within the receptive field. The proposed
network adopts the framework of the recently developed Network In Network
structure, which slides a universal approximator, multilayer perceptron (MLP)
with rectifier units, to exact features. Instead of MLP, we employ maxout MLP
to learn a variety of piecewise linear activation functions and to mediate the
problem of vanishing gradients that can occur when using rectifier units.
Moreover, batch normalization is applied to reduce the saturation of maxout
units by pre-conditioning the model and dropout is applied to prevent
overfitting. Finally, average pooling is used in all pooling layers to
regularize maxout MLP in order to facilitate information abstraction in every
receptive field while tolerating the change of object position. Because average
pooling preserves all features in the local patch, the proposed MIN model can
enforce the suppression of irrelevant information during training. Our
experiments demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performance when
the MIN model was applied to MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets and

and much studied model is that in which the shear flow has constant vorticity.
Recently it was shown by Constantin [Eur. J. Mech. B/Fluids 30 (2011) 12-16]
that a flow of constant vorticity can only permit waves travelling exactly
upstream or downstream, but not at oblique angles to the current, and several
proofs to the same effect have appeared thereafter. Physical waves cannot
possibly adhere to such a restriction, however. We resolve the paradox by
showing that an oblique plane wave propagating atop a current of constant
vorticity according to the linearized Euler equation carries with it an
undulating perturbation of the vorticity field, hence is not prohibited by the
Constantin theorem since vorticity is not constant. The perturbation of the
vorticity field is readily interpreted in a Lagrangian perspective as the wave
motion gently shifting and twisting the vortex lines as the wave passes. In the
special case of upstream or downstream propagation, the wave advection of
vortex lines does not affect the Eulerian vorticity field, in accordance with
the theorem. We conclude that the study of oblique waves on shear currents
requires a formalism allowing undulating perturbations of the vorticity field,
and the constant vorticity model is helpful only in certain 2D systems.

distributed computation on clusters. In distributed computation, graph
partitioning (GP) methods assign the vertices or edges of a graph to different
machines in a balanced way so that some distributed algorithms can be adapted
for. Most of traditional GP methods are offline, which means that the whole
graph has been observed before partitioning. However, the offline methods often
incur high computation cost. Hence, streaming graph partitioning (SGP) methods,
which can partition graphs in an online way, have recently attracted great
attention in distributed computation. There exist two typical GP strategies:
edge-cut and vertex-cut. Most SGP methods adopt edge-cut, but few vertex-cut
methods have been proposed for SGP. However, the vertex-cut strategy would be a
better choice than the edge-cut strategy because the degree of a natural graph
in general follows a highly skewed power-law distribution. Thus, we propose a
novel method, called S-PowerGraph, for SGP of natural graphs by vertex-cut. Our
S-PowerGraph method is simple but effective. Experiments on several large
natural graphs and synthetic graphs show that our S-PowerGraph can outperform
the state-of-the-art baselines.

by the treatment of complex source processes. Scenario-based seismic hazard
maps are purely based on geophysical and seismotectonic features of a region
and take into account the occurrence frequency of earthquakes only for their
classification into exceptional (catastrophic), rare (disastrous), sporadic
(very strong), occasional (strong) and frequent. Therefore they may provide an
upper bound for the ground motion levels to be expected for most regions of the
world, more appropriate than probabilities of exceedance in view of the long
time scales required for the protection of historical buildings. The
neo-deterministic approach naturally supplies realistic time series of ground
motion, which represent also reliable estimates of ground displacement readily
applicable to seismic isolation techniques, useful to preserve historical
monuments and relevant man made structures. This methodology has been
successfully applied to many urban areas worldwide for the purpose of seismic
microzoning, to strategic buildings, lifelines and cultural heritage sites; we
will discuss its application to the cities of Rome and Florence.

increasing centrality in our digital lives make a framework for mobile app
optimization an imperative. While tuning strategies for desktop and server
applications have a long history, it is difficult to adapt them for use on
mobile phones.
  Reference inputs which trigger behavior similar to a mobile application's
typical are hard to construct. For many classes of applications the very
concept of typical behavior is nonexistent, each user interacting with the
application in very different ways. In contexts like this, optimization
strategies need to evaluate their effectiveness against real user input, but
doing so online runs the risk of user dissatisfaction when suboptimal
optimizations are evaluated.
  In this paper we present an iterative compiler which employs a novel capture
and replay technique in order to collect real user input and use it later to
evaluate different transformations offline. The proposed mechanism identifies
and stores only the set of memory pages needed to replay the most heavily used
functions of the application. At idle periods, this minimal state is combined
with different binaries of the application, each one build with different
optimizations enabled. Replaying the targeted functions allows us to evaluate
the effectiveness of each set of optimizations for the actual way the user
interacts with the application.
  For the BEEBS benchmark suite, our approach was able to improve performance
by up to 57%, while keeping the slowdown experienced by the user on average at
0.8%. By focusing only on heavily used functions, we are able to conserve
storage space by between two and three orders of magnitude compared to typical
capture and replay implementations.

averaging: a polynomial, an entropic, and a scaling-invariant protocol, where
terminology characterizes the particular non-linearity appearing in the
respective differential protocol equation. We prove exponential convergence to
consensus for positive initial conditions. For the novel protocols we highlight
connections to applied network problems: The polynomial consensus system is
structured like a system of chemical kinetics on a graph. The entropic
consensus system converges to the weighted geometric mean of the initial
condition, which is an immediate extension of the (weighted) average consensus
problem. We find that all three protocols generate gradient flows of free
energy on the simplex of constant mass distribution vectors albeit in different

geometric mean as the solution of a non-linear constrained optimization problem
involving free energy as cost function. We illustrate our findings in numerical

show a spectral steepening above 30 GHz, consistent with synchrotron emission
becoming optically thin. Thus, the classical dichotomy between
flat-spectrum/compact and steep-spectrum/extended radio sources, well
established at cm wavelengths, breaks down at mm wavelengths. The mm-wave

since such information can be provided by the phonon spectral energy density

framework of equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation (EMD). However, until
now it has not been realized in non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations
(NEMD), the other widely used computational method for calculating thermal
transport of materials in addition to EMD. In this work, a computational scheme
based on time Fourier transform of atomistic heat current, called frequency

contributions of frequency dependent thermal conductivity in NEMD simulations.
The FDDDM results of Lennard-Jones (LJ) Argon and Stillinger-Weber (SW) Si are
compared with TDNMA method from EMD simulation. Similar trends are found for
both cases, which confirm the validity of our FDDDM approach. Benefiting from
the inherent nature of NEMD and the theoretical formula that does not require
any temperature assumption, the FDDDM can be directly used to investigate the
size and temperature effect. Moreover, the unique advantage of FDDDM prior to
previous methods (such as SED and TDNMA) is that it can be straightforwardly
used to characterize the phonon frequency dependent thermal conductivity of
disordered systems, such as amorphous materials. The FDDDM approach can also be
a good candidate to be used to understand the phonon behaviors and thus

time-dependent surface pressure distribution, in the presence of a shear
current of uniform vorticity beneath the surface, in three dimensions.
Linearized governing equations and boundary conditions including the effects of
gravity, a distributed external pressure disturbance, and constant finite
depth, are solved analytically, and particular attention is paid to classic
initial value problems: an initial pressure impulse and a steady pressure
distribution which appears suddenly. In the present paper, good agreement with
previous results is demonstrated. We subsequently show both analytically and
numerically how transient waves from a suddenly appearing steady pressure
distribution vanis for large times, and steady ship waves remain. The transient
contribution to wave resistance was derived. The results show that a shear
current has significant impact on the transient wave motions, resulting in
asymmetry between upstream and downstream waves. The case of the suddenly
appearing steady pressure is an intermediate case between ring waves and ship
waves, starting out as the former and evolving gradually into the latter. The
ship's direction of motion relative to the current is found to be crucial in
determining how quickly effects of transient waves die out. Transient effects
take much longer to doe out for a ship going against the shear flow than for
one going downstream, when the two ships have the same velocity relative to the
water surface. For ship motion against the shear current, thus, wave effects of
transients, e.g., due to maneuvering could accumulate and be far more
significant than on a uniform current.

calculates the longest common prefix of two strings. We present an efficient
data structure for this problem, where an update requires only $O(\log n)$
worst-case time with high probability, with $n$ being the total length of all

dark matter used predefined spatial templates to describe the background of
$\gamma$-ray emission from astrophysical processes like cosmic ray
interactions. In this work, we aim to establish an alternative approach, in
which the astrophysical components are identified solely by their spectral and
morphological properties. To this end, we adopt the recent reconstruction of
the diffuse $\gamma$-ray sky from Fermi data by the D$^{3}$PO algorithm and the
fact that more than 90\% of its flux can be represented by only two spectral
components, resulting form the dense and dilute interstellar medium. Under
these presumptions, we confirm the reported DM annihilation-like signal in the
inner Galaxy and derive upper limits for dark matter annihilation cross
sections. We investigate whether the DM signal could be a residual of the
simplified modeling of astrophysical emission by inspecting the morphology of
the regions, which favor a dark matter component. The central galactic region
favors strongest for such a component with the expected spherically symmetric
and radially declining profile. However, astrophysical structures, in
particular sky regions which seem to host most of the dilute interstellar
medium, obviously would benefit from a DM annihilation-like component as well.
Although these regions do not drive the fit, they warn that a more detailed
understanding of astrophysical $\gamma$-ray emitting processes in the galactic
center region are necessary before definite claims about a DM annihilation
signal can be made. The regions off the Galactic plane actually disfavor the
best fit DM annihilation cross section from the inner Galactic region unless
the radial decline of the Galactic DM density profile in the outer regions is
significantly steeper than that usually assumed.

equivalence between the $\Phi$-Sobolev inequalities and an exponential decrease
of the $\Phi$-entropies. In this work, we develop a framework of Markov
semigroups on matrix-valued functions and generalize the above equivalence to
the exponential decay of matrix $\Phi$-entropies. This result also specializes
to spectral gap inequalities and modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities in
the random matrix setting. To establish the main result, we define a
non-commutative generalization of the carr\'e du champ operator, and prove a de
Bruijn's identity for matrix-valued functions.
  The proposed Markov semigroups acting on matrix-valued functions have
immediate applications in the characterization of the dynamical evolution of
quantum ensembles. We consider two special cases of quantum unital channels,
namely, the depolarizing channel and the phase-damping channel. In the former,
since there exists a unique equilibrium state, we show that the matrix
$\Phi$-entropy of the resulting quantum ensemble decays exponentially as time
goes on. Consequently, we obtain a stronger notion of monotonicity of the
Holevo quantity - the Holevo quantity of the quantum ensemble decays
exponentially in time and the convergence rate is determined by the modified
log-Sobolev inequalities. However, in the latter, the matrix $\Phi$-entropy of
the quantum ensemble that undergoes the phase-damping Markovian evolution
generally will not decay exponentially. This is because there are multiple
equilibrium states for such a channel.
  Finally, we also consider examples of statistical mixing of Markov semigroups
on matrix-valued functions. We can explicitly calculate the convergence rate of
a Markovian jump process defined on Boolean hypercubes, and provide upper
bounds of the mixing time on these types of examples.

vacancies and nano grain size on the spin polarized current, which are
controlled by growing the Co-doped ZnO thin-films at room temperature in a
reducing atmosphere [Ar + (1% ~ 30%) H2]. We found that the conductivity
increases with an increase in oxygen vacancies via two independent channels:
the variable range hopping (VRH) within localized states and the itinerant
transport in the conduction band. The Andreev Reflection measurements prove
that the VRH conduction is equivalent to spin polarized current. Transport
measurements show that the best way to increase the VRH content, or the
percentage of spin polarized current, is to increase oxygen vacancy
concentration and to reduce grain size and lattice constants of the films.

in Antarctica, Chile, New Zealand, and South Africa to monitor the jets of
radio-loud active galaxies in the southern hemisphere. Lower resolution radio
flux density measurements at multiple radio frequencies over four years of
observations were obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA).
The TANAMI VLBI image at 8.4 GHz shows an extended one-sided jet with a
dominant compact VLBI core. Its brightness temperature is consistent with
equipartition, but it is an order of magnitude below other g-NLS1s with the
sample value varying over two orders of magnitude. We find a compact morphology
with a projected large-scale size <11 kpc and a persistent steep radio spectrum
with moderate flux-density variability. PKS 2004-447 appears to be a unique
member of the g-NLS1 sample. It exhibits blazar-like features, such as a flat
featureless X-ray spectrum and a core dominated, one-sided parsec-scale jet
with indications for relativistic beaming. However, the data also reveal
properties atypical for blazars, such as a radio spectrum and large-scale size
consistent with Compact-Steep-Spectrum (CSS) objects, which are usually

turbulence in vertically elongated boxes in order to warrant better
decorrelation of the Lagrangian signals in the direction of gravity. Since only
a limited number of Fourier modes are forced, it is possible to evaluate the

development. It aims at a higher target-to-background activity ratio implying
both a smaller radiopharmaceutical activity and the possibility of extending
the technique to cases with a large uptake of surrounding healthy organs. Such
technique requires a dedicated intraoperative probe detecting $\beta^-$
radiation. A first prototype has been developed relying on the low density and
high light yield of the diphenylbutadiene doped para-therphenyl organic
scintillator. The scintillation light produced in a cylindrical crystal, 5 mm
in diameter and 3 mm in height, is guided to a photo-multiplier tube by optical
fibres. The custom readout electronics is designed to optimize its usage in
terms of feedback to the surgeon, portability and remote monitoring of the
signal. Tests show that with a radiotracer activity comparable to those
administered for diagnostic purposes the developed probe can detect a 0.1 ml
cancerous residual of meningioma in a few seconds.

the presence of turbulence and the magnetic fields existence has been proved
through observations of Faraday Rotation and synchrotron emission. The ICM is
also known to be filled by a rarefied weakly collisional plasma. In this work
we study the possible signatures left on Faraday Rotation maps by collisionless
instabilities. For this purpose we use a numerical approach to investigate the
dynamics of the turbulence in collisionless plasmas based on an
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) formalism taking into account different levels of
pressure anisotropy. We consider models covering the sub/super-Alfv\'enic and
trans/supersonic regimes, one of them representing the fiducial conditions
corresponding to the ICM. From the simulated models we compute Faraday Rotation
maps and analyze several statistical indicators in order to characterize the
magnetic field structure and compare the results obtained with the
collisionless model to those obtained using standard collisional MHD framework.
We find that important imprints of the pressure anisotropy prevails in the
magnetic field and also manifest in the associated Faraday Rotation maps which
evidence smaller correlation lengths in the collisionless MHD case. These
points are remarkably noticeable for the case mimicking the conditions
prevailing in ICM. Nevertheless, in this study we have neglected the decrease
of pressure anisotropy due to the feedback of the instabilities that naturally
arise in collisionless plasmas at small scales. This decrease may not affect
the statistical imprint differences described above, but should be examined
elsewhere.

into quantum physics but also offers a crucial basis for practical
applications. For continuous-variable (CV) systems, Gaussian states among
others have been extensively studied, however, mostly confined to Gaussian
measurements. While the fulfillment of Gaussian criterion is sufficient to
detect CV steering, whether it is also necessary for Gaussian states is a
question of fundamental importance in many contexts. This critically questions
the validity of characterizations established only under Gaussian measurements
like the quantification of steering and the monogamy relations. Here, we
introduce a formalism based on local uncertainty relations of non-Gaussian
measurements, which is shown to manifest quantum steering of some Gaussian
states that Gaussian criterion fails to detect. To this aim, we look into
Gaussian states of practical relevance, i.e. two-mode squeezed states under a
lossy and an amplifying Gaussian channel. Our finding significantly modifies
the characteristics of Gaussian-state steering so far established such as
monogamy relations and one-way steering under Gaussian measurements, thus
opening a new direction for critical studies beyond Gaussian regime.

models (that have only one more additional parameter than $\Lambda$CDM), i.e.,
the $w$CDM model and the holographic dark energy (HDE) model, as examples, to
make an analysis. In the cosmological fits, we use the Planck 2015 temperature
and polarization data, in combination with other low-redshift observations,
including the baryon acoustic oscillations, type Ia supernovae, and Hubble
constant measurement, as well as the Planck lensing measurements. We find that,
once dynamical dark energy is considered, the degeneracy between $\sum m_\nu$
and $H_0$ will be changed, i.e., in the $\Lambda$CDM model, $\sum m_\nu$ is
anti-correlated with $H_0$, but in the $w$CDM and HDE models, $\sum m_\nu$
becomes positively correlated with $H_0$. Compared to $\Lambda$CDM, in the
$w$CDM model the limit on $\sum m_\nu$ becomes much looser, but in the HDE
model the limit becomes much tighter. In the HDE model, we obtain $\sum
m_\nu<0.113$ eV ($95\%$ CL) with the combined data sets, which is perhaps the
most stringent upper limit by far on neutrino mass. Thus, our result in the HDE

individually. Entanglement entropy gives quantitative understanding to the
entanglement. We use decomposition of the Hilbert space to discuss properties
of the entanglement. Therefore, partial trace operator becomes important to
define the reduced density matrix from different centers, which commutes with
all elements in the Hilbert space, corresponding to different entanglement
choices or different observations on entangling surface. Entanglement entropy
is expected to satisfy the strong subadditivity. We discuss decomposition of
the Hilbert space for the strong subadditivity and other related inequalities.
The entanglement entropy with centers can be computed from the Hamitonian
formulations systematically, provided that we know wavefunctional. In the
Hamitonian formulation, it is easier to obtain symmetry structure. We consider
massless $p$-form theory as an example. The massless $p$-form theory in
($2p+2)$-dimensions has global symmetry, similar to the electric-magnetic
duality, connecting centers in ground state. This defines a duality structure
in centers. Because it is hard to exactly compute the entanglement entropy from
partial trace operator, we propose the Lagrangian formulation from the
Hamitonian formulation to compute the entanglement entropy with centers. From
the Lagrangian method and saddle point approximation, the codimension two
surface term (leading order) in the Einstein gravity theory or holographic
entanglement entropy should correspond to non-tensor product decomposition
(center is not identity). Finally, we compute the entanglement entropy of the
$SU(N)$ Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory in the fundamental representation using
the strong coupling expansion in the extended lattice model to obtain spatial
area term in total dimensions larger than two for $N>1$.

gravitational-wave and electromagnetic astronomy. The goal of this work is to
investigate the strategy of using gravitational wave sky-localizations for
binary neutron star systems, to search for electromagnetic counterparts using
wide field of view optical telescopes. We examine various strategies of
scanning the gravitational wave sky-localizations on the mock 2015-16
gravitational-wave events. We propose an optimal tiling-strategy that would
ensure the most economical coverage of the gravitational wave sky-localization,
while keeping in mind the realistic constrains of transient optical astronomy.
Our analysis reveals that the proposed tiling strategy improves the
sky-localization coverage over naive contour-covering method. The improvement
is more significant for observations conducted using larger field of view
telescopes, or for observations conducted over smaller confidence interval of
gravitational wave sky-localization probability distribution. Next, we
investigate the performance of the tiling strategy for telescope arrays and
compare their performance against monolithic giant field of view telescopes. We
observed that distributing the field of view of the telescopes into arrays of
multiple telescopes significantly improves the coverage efficiency by as much
as 50% over a single large FOV telescope in 2016 localizations while scanning
around 100 sq. degrees. Finally, we studied the ability of optical counterpart
detection by various types of telescopes. In Our analysis for a range of wide
field-of-view telescopes we found improvement in detection upon sacrificing
coverage of localization in order to achieve greater observation depth for very
large field-of-view - small aperture telescopes, especially if the intrinsic
brightness of the optical counterparts are weak.

fully convolutional networks (FCNs). However, FCNs use large receptive fields
and many pooling layers, both of which cause blurring and low spatial
resolution in the deep layers. As a result FCNs tend to produce segmentations
that are poorly localized around object boundaries. Prior work has attempted to
address this issue in post-processing steps, for example using a color-based
CRF on top of the FCN predictions. However, these approaches require additional
parameters and low-level features that are difficult to tune and integrate into
the original network architecture. Additionally, most CRFs use color-based
pixel affinities, which are not well suited for semantic segmentation and lead
to spatially disjoint predictions.
  To overcome these problems, we introduce a Boundary Neural Field (BNF), which
is a global energy model integrating FCN predictions with boundary cues. The
boundary information is used to enhance semantic segment coherence and to
improve object localization. Specifically, we first show that the convolutional
filters of semantic FCNs provide good features for boundary detection. We then
employ the predicted boundaries to define pairwise potentials in our energy.
Finally, we show that our energy decomposes semantic segmentation into multiple
binary problems, which can be relaxed for efficient global optimization. We
report extensive experiments demonstrating that minimization of our global
boundary-based energy yields results superior to prior globalization methods,
both quantitatively as well as qualitatively.

and the respective parameter $\alpha$ is changing in the interval

guaranteed lower bound of $\zeta_{lim}$. Reduction of the problem to a finite

bound $\zeta_{lim,h}$. Under certain assumptions, we prove that $\zeta_{lim,h}$

objects that barely register on a conscious level. Recent neuroscientific
research demonstrates that humans have a fixed size prior for salient objects.
This suggests that a salient object in 3D undergoes a consistent transformation
such that people's visual system perceives it with an approximately fixed size.
This finding indicates that there exists a consistent egocentric object prior
that can be characterized by shape, size, depth, and location in the first
person view.
  In this paper, we develop an EgoObject Representation, which encodes these
characteristics by incorporating shape, location, size and depth features from
an egocentric RGBD image. We empirically show that this representation can
accurately characterize the egocentric object prior by testing it on an
egocentric RGBD dataset for three tasks: the 3D saliency detection, future
saliency prediction, and interaction classification. This representation is
evaluated on our new Egocentric RGBD Saliency dataset that includes various
activities such as cooking, dining, and shopping. By using our EgoObject
representation, we outperform previously proposed models for saliency detection
(relative 30% improvement for 3D saliency detection task) on our dataset.
Additionally, we demonstrate that this representation allows us to predict
future salient objects based on the gaze cue and classify people's interactions
with objects.

  Information Forensics and Security, 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The volume of convolutional neural network (CNN) models proposed for face
recognition has been continuously growing larger to better fit large amount of
training data. When training data are obtained from internet, the labels are
likely to be ambiguous and inaccurate. This paper presents a Light CNN
framework to learn a compact embedding on the large-scale face data with
massive noisy labels. First, we introduce a variation of maxout activation,
called Max-Feature-Map (MFM), into each convolutional layer of CNN. Different
from maxout activation that uses many feature maps to linearly approximate an
arbitrary convex activation function, MFM does so via a competitive
relationship. MFM can not only separate noisy and informative signals but also
play the role of feature selection between two feature maps. Second, three
networks are carefully designed to obtain better performance meanwhile reducing
the number of parameters and computational costs. Lastly, a semantic
bootstrapping method is proposed to make the prediction of the networks more
consistent with noisy labels. Experimental results show that the proposed
framework can utilize large-scale noisy data to learn a Light model that is
efficient in computational costs and storage spaces. The learned single network
with a 256-D representation achieves state-of-the-art results on various face
benchmarks without fine-tuning. The code is released on

generalizing Majorana fermions, which correspond to the case $d=2$. In contrast
to Majorana fermions, braiding of parafermions with $d>2$ allows to perform an
entangling gate. This has spurred interest in parafermions and a variety of
condensed matter systems have been proposed as potential hosts for them. In
this work, we study the computational power of braiding parafermions more
systematically. We make no assumptions on the underlying physical model but
derive all our results from the algebraical relations that define parafermions.
We find a familiy of $2d$ representations of the braid group that are
compatible with these relations. The braiding operators derived this way
reproduce those derived previously from physical grounds as special cases. We

However, to date, attempts to experimentally observe either the strength of SOC

bulk-sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with

with relativity in terms of the strength of SOC and average atomic numbers,
indicating strong relativistic effects on NMR parameters. According to
first-principles calculations, we further claim that nuclear magnetic
shieldings from relativistic p1/2 states and paramagnetic contributions from
low-lying unoccupied p3/2 states are both sensitive to the details of band
structures tuned by relativity, which explains why the hidden relativistic

the quantum enhancement to a constant factor, and thus bound the error to the
standard asymptotic scaling. In particular, that is the case of
time-homogeneous (Lindbladian) dephasing and, more generally, all semigroup
dynamics that include phase covariant terms, which commute with the system

this case, the ultimate precision is determined by the system short-time

non-standard asymptotic resolution. In particular, we demonstrate that the

are the velocities indicative of virialised structures or have they been

spectral estimation while $s$ true frequencies are located on the continuum of
a bounded domain. Inspired by the matrix pencil form, we construct a D-fold
Hankel matrix from the measurements and exploit its Vandermonde decomposition
in the noiseless case. MUSIC amounts to identifying a noise subspace,
evaluating a noise-space correlation function, and localizing frequencies by
searching the $s$ smallest local minima of the noise-space correlation
function.
  In the noiseless case, $(2s)^D$ measurements guarantee an exact
reconstruction by MUSIC as the noise-space correlation function vanishes
exactly at true frequencies. When noise exists, we provide an explicit estimate
on the perturbation of the noise-space correlation function in terms of noise
level, dimension $D$, the minimum separation among frequencies, the maximum and
minimum amplitudes while frequencies are separated by two Rayleigh Length (RL)
at each direction. As a by-product the maximum and minimum non-zero singular
values of the multidimensional Vandermonde matrix whose nodes are on the unit
sphere are estimated under a gap condition of the nodes. Under the 2-RL
separation condition, if noise is i.i.d. gaussian, we show that perturbation of
the noise-space correlation function decays like
$\sqrt{\log(\#(\mathbf{N}))/\#(\mathbf{N})}$ as the sample size
$\#(\mathbf{N})$ increases.
  When the separation among frequencies drops below 2 RL, our numerical
experiments show that the noise tolerance of MUSIC obeys a power law with the
minimum separation of frequencies.

diversified physical properties, such as spin degrees of freedom or particle

develop several rotation properties of the generalized Wiener integral

a growing need for the fabrication of miniaturized devices at micro- and
nanoscales. The traditional phenomenological laws, such as Fourier's law of
heat conduction, are challenged in the microscale regime and a hyperbolic or
dual phase lag model should be employed. During ultrafast laser interaction
with metal, the electrons and lattices are not in equilibrium. Various
two-temperature models that can be used to describe the nonequilibrium heat
transfer are presented. A semi-classical two-step heating model to investigate
thermal transport in metals caused by ultrashort laser heating is also
presented. The main difference between the semiclassical and the
phenomenological two-temperature models is that the former includes the effects
of electron drifting, which could result in significantly different electron
and lattice temperature response from the latter for higher-intensity and
shorter-pulse laser heating. Under higher laser fluence and/or short pulse, the
lattice temperature can exceed the melting point and melting takes place. The
liquid phase will be resolidified when the lattice is cooled by conducting heat
away. Ultrafast melting and resolidification of the thin gold film and
microparticles were investigated. At even shorter pulse width, femtosecond
laser heating on metals produces a blasting force from hot electrons in the
sub-picosecond domain, which exerts on the metal lattices along with the
non-equilibrium heat flow. Our work that employs the parabolic two-step heating
model to study the effect of the hot-electron blast in multi-layered thin metal
films is also presented.

since the major obstacle is the lack of adequate knowledge of rate coefficients
of various reactions which take place in interstellar conditions. In this work,
we study the possibility of forming three pyrimidine bases, namely, cytosine,
uracil and thymine in interstellar regions. Our study reveals that the
synthesis of uracil from cytosine and water is quite impossible under
interstellar circumstances. For the synthesis of thymine, reaction between
uracil and :CH2 is investigated. Since no other relevant pathways for the
formation of uracil and thymine were available in the literature, we consider a
large gas-grain chemical network to study the chemical evolution of cytosine in
gas and ice phases. Our modeling result shows that cytosine would be produced
in cold, dense interstellar conditions. However, presence of cytosine is yet to
be established. We propose that a new molecule, namely, C4N3OH5 could be
observable in the interstellar region. C4N3OH5 is a precursor (Z isomer of
cytosine) of cytosine and far more abundant than cytosine. We hope that
observation of this precursor molecule would enable us to estimate the
abundance of cytosine in interstellar regions. We also carry out quantum
chemical calculations to find out the vibrational as well as rotational
transitions of this precursor molecule along with three pyrimidine bases.

by Mazur and Mottola of a neutral gravastar \cite{Mazur2001,Mazur2004} have
been observed as an alternative to $D$-dimensional versions of the
Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. To tackle the spherical system in a
convenient way we have configured that the gravastar consists of three distinct
regions with different equations of state as follows: [I] Interior region $0
\leq r < r_1$,$\rho = -p$, [II] Thin shell region $r_1 \leq r < r_2$,$\rho =
p$, and [III] Exterior region $r_2 < r$,$\rho = p =0$. The outer region of this
gravastar model therefore corresponds to a higher dimensional
Reissner-Nordstr{\""o}m black hole. In connection to this junction conditions
are provided and therefore we have formulated mass and the related Equation of
State of the gravastar. It has been shown that the model satisfies all the
requirements of the physical features. However, overall observational survey of
the results also provide probable indication of non-applicability of higher
dimensional approach for construction of a gravastar with or without charge
from an ordinary $4$-dimensional seed as far as physical ground is concerned.
