classical by now isopereimetric inequalities which can be proved in a unified
way. This unified approach reduces them to the so-called exterior differential
systems studied by Robert Bryant and Phillip Griffiths. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first article where this connection is used. After
reviewing a list of classical inequalities (log-Sobolev inequality, Beckner's
inequality, Bobkov's functional isoperimetric inequality and several other
inequalities) we use our method to generate new isoperimetric inequalities, in
particular, we found the sharpening of Beckner--Sobolev inequalities with

interest in studying the progression to higher level degree courses during the
academic career. In particular, after the achievement of the first level
qualification (Bachelor degree), students have to decide whether to continue
their university studies, by enrolling in a second level (Master) programme, or
to conclude their training experience. In this work we propose a binary
quantile regression approach to analyze the Bachelor-Master transition
phenomenon with the adoption of the Bayesian inferential perspective. In
addition to the traditional predictors of academic outcomes, such as the
personal characteristics and the field of study, different aspects of the
student's performance are considered. Moreover, a new contextual variable,
indicating the type of university regulations, is taken into account in the
model specification. The utility of the Bayesian binary quantile regression to
characterize the non-continuation decision after the first cycle studies is
illustrated with an application to administrative data of Bachelor graduates at
the School of Economics of Sapienza University of Rome and compared with a more
conventional logistic regression approach.

radii significantly larger than predicted by standard models. It has been

estimating the radii of low-mass stars in three young clusters (NGC 2264, NGC
2547, NGC 2516, with ages of 5, 35 and 140 Myr respectively), we aim to
establish whether similar radius inflation is seen in single, magnetically
active stars. We use radial velocities from the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) and
published photometry to establish cluster membership and combine GES
measurements of vsini with published rotation periods to estimate average radii
for groups of fast-rotating cluster members as a function of their luminosity
and age. The average radii are compared with the predictions of both standard
evolutionary models and variants that include magnetic inhibition of convection
and starspots. At a given luminosity, the stellar radii in NGC 2516 and NGC
2547 are larger than predicted by standard evolutionary models at the ages of
these clusters. The discrepancy is least pronounced and not significant ~10
percent) in ZAMS stars with radiative cores, but more significant in
lower-mass, fully convective pre main-sequence cluster members, reaching
30+/-10 percent. The uncertain age and distance of NGC 2264 preclude a reliable
determination of any discrepancy for its members. The median radii we have
estimated for low-mass fully convective stars in the older clusters are
inconsistent (at the 2-3 sigma level) with non-magnetic evolutionary models and
more consistent with models that incorporate the effects of magnetic fields or
dark starspots. The available models suggest this requires either surface
magnetic fields exceeding 2.5 kG, spots that block about 30 per cent of the
photospheric flux, or a more moderate combination of both. [Abridged]

the output layer, wherein we use a discriminative training loss and a weighted

importance sampling, and noise contrastive estimation (NCE). Our experiments,
on the recently released one billion word language modeling benchmark,
demonstrate scalability and accuracy of BlackOut; we outperform the

noise and redundancies in data. In this paper, we investigate the effect of
feature selection in improving the prediction of patient deterioration in ICUs.
We consider lab tests as features. Thus, choosing a subset of features would
mean choosing the most important lab tests to perform. If the number of tests
can be reduced by identifying the most important tests, then we could also
identify the redundant tests. By omitting the redundant tests, observation time
could be reduced and early treatment could be provided to avoid the risk.
Additionally, unnecessary monetary cost would be avoided. Our approach uses
state-ofthe- art feature selection for predicting ICU patient deterioration
using the medical lab results. We apply our technique on the publicly available

provide a detailed analysis of the best features identified by our approach.

fields have been published in literature. Furthermore, several authors recently
claimed existence of the helicity=0 fundamental field. We re-examine the theory
of antisymmetric tensor fields and 4-vector potentials. We study the massless
limits. In fact, a theoretical motivation for this venture is the old papers of
Ogievetskii and Polubarinov, Hayashi, and Kalb and Ramond. They proposed the
concept of the notoph, whose helicity properties are complementary to those of
the photon. We analyze the quantum field theory with taking into account mass
dimensions of the notoph and the photon. It appears to be possible to describe
both photon and notoph degrees of freedom on the basis of the modified
Bargmann-Wigner formalism for the symmetric second-rank spinor. Next, we
proceed to derive equations for the symmetric tensor of the second rank on the
basis of the Bargmann-Wigner formalism in a straightforward way. The symmetric
multispinor of the fourth rank is used. Due to serious problems with the
interpretation of the results obtained on using the standard procedure we
generalize it and obtain the spin-2 relativistic equations, which are
consistent with the general relativity. Thus, in fact we deduced the
gravitational field equations from relativistic quantum mechanics. The
relations of this theory with the scalar-tensor theories of gravitation and
f(R) are discussed. Particular attention has been paid to the correct
definitions of the energy-momentum tensor and other Noether currents in the
electromagnetic theory, the relativistic theory of gravitation, the general
relativity, and their generalizations. We estimate possible interactions,

establishes LDPs with respect to stronger Wasserstein-type topologies. Our

validity against numerical simulations in a statistical fashion, there are few
analyses to compare the TSC dynamics in an individual object-wise basis, which
is what we attempt in the present paper. We extract 100 halos at z = 0 from a
cosmological N-body simulation according to the conventional TSC criterion for
the spherical over-density. Then we trace back their spherical counter-parts at
earlier epochs. Just prior to the turn-around epoch of the halos, their
dynamics is well approximated by TSC, but their turn-around epochs are
systematically delayed and the virial radii are larger by ~ 20 percent on
average relative to the TSC predictions. We find that this systematic deviation
is mainly ascribed to the non-uniformity/inhomogeneity of dark matter density
profiles and the non-zero velocity dispersions, both of which are neglected in
TSC. In particular, the inside-out-collapse and shell-crossing of dark matter
halos play an important role in generating the significant velocity dispersion.
The implications of the present result are briefly discussed.

nonthermal electron distribution at low energies derived from the X-ray
spectral fit, while the remaining parameters, unconstrained by the X-ray data,

modeling suggests that the accelerated electrons are trapped in the coronal
part of the flaring loop, but away from where the magnetic field is minimal,
and, thus, demonstrates that the data are clearly inconsistent with electron
magnetic trapping in the weak diffusion regime mediated by the Coulomb
collisions. Thus, the modeling supports the interpretation of the coronal
thick-target sources as sites of electron acceleration in flares and supplies
us with a realistic 3D model with physical parameters of the acceleration

strategic vendors and a single buyer, modeling a scenario in which multiple
competing vendors have very good knowledge of a buyer, as is common in online
markets. We add to this model the realistic assumption that the buyer has a
fixed budget and does not have unlimited funds. When the buyer's valuation
function is additive, we are able to completely characterize the different
possible pure Nash Equilibria (PNE) and in particular obtain a necessary and
sufficient condition for uniqueness. Furthermore, we characterize the market
clearing (or Walresian) equilibria for all submodular valuations.
  Surprisingly, for certain monotone submodular function valuations, we show
that the pure NE can exhibit some counterintuitive phenomena; namely, there is
a valuation such that the pricing will be market clearing and within budget if
the buyer does not reveal the budget but will result in a smaller set of
allocated items (and higher prices for items) if the buyer does reveal the
budget. It is also the case that the conditions that guarantee market clearing
in Babaioff et al for submodular functions are not necessarily market clearing
when there is a budget. Furthermore, with respect to social welfare, while
without budgets all equilibria are optimal (i.e. POA = POS = 1), we show that
with budgets the worst equilibrium may only achieve 1/(n-2) of the best
equilibrium.

using SGL is difficult to effectively constrain the model parameters. However,
when the SGL data are combined with CBS (CMB+BAO+SN) data, the reasonable
estimations can be given and the constraint precision is improved to a certain
extent, relative to the case of CBS only. Therefore, SGL is an useful way to
tighten constraints on model parameters.

important supplement to current cosmological observations because it measures
the redshift drift in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of distant
quasars, covering the ""redshift desert"" of $2 \lesssim z \lesssim5$. To avoid
data inconsistency, we use the best-fit models based on current combined
observational data as fiducial models to simulate 30 mock SL test data. We
quantify the impact of these SL test data on parameter estimation for $f(T)$

$f(T)_{PL}$ and the exponential-form model $f(T)_{EXP}$. The results show that
the SL test can effectively break the existing strong degeneracy between the
present-day matter density $\Omega_m$ and the Hubble constant $H_0$ in other
cosmological observations. For the considered $f(T)$ models, a 30-year
observation of the SL test can improve the constraint precision of $\Omega_m$

that allow universes to be habitable. We focus on the fine structure constant
$\alpha$ and the gravitational structure constant $\alpha_G$, and find the
region in the $\alpha$-$\alpha_G$ plane that supports working stars and
habitable planets. This work is motivated, in part, by the possibility that
different versions of the laws of physics could be realized within other
universes. The following constraints are enforced: [A] long-lived stable
nuclear burning stars exist, [B] planetary surface temperatures are hot enough
to support chemical reactions, [C] stellar lifetimes are long enough to allow
biological evolution, [D] planets are massive enough to maintain atmospheres,
[E] planets are small enough in mass to remain non-degenerate, [F] planets are
massive enough to support sufficiently complex biospheres, [G] planets are
smaller in mass than their host stars, and [H] stars are smaller in mass than
their host galaxies. This paper delineates the portion of the
$\alpha$-$\alpha_G$ plane that satisfies all of these constraints. The results
indicate that viable universes --- with working stars and habitable planets ---
can exist within a parameter space where the structure constants $\alpha$ and
$\alpha_G$ vary by several orders of magnitude. These constraints also provide
upper bounds on the structure constants ($\alpha,\alpha_G$) and their ratio. We
find the limit $\alpha_G/\alpha<10^{-34}$, which shows that habitable universes
must have a large hierarchy between the strengths of the gravitational force
and the electromagnetic force.

accurately predicting pressure losses due to wake mixing in turbomachinery
applications. An unsteady adjoint of such high fidelity simulations is useful
for design optimization in these aerodynamic applications. In this paper we
present unsteady adjoint solutions using a large eddy simulation model for a
vane from VKI using aerothermal objectives. The unsteady adjoint method is
effective in capturing the gradient for a short time interval aerothermal
objective, whereas the method provides diverging gradients for long
time-averaged thermal objectives. As the boundary layer on the suction side
near the trailing edge of the vane is turbulent, it poses a challenge for the
adjoint solver. The chaotic dynamics cause the adjoint solution to diverge
exponentially from the trailing edge region when solved backwards in time. This
results in the corruption of the sensitivities obtained from the adjoint
solutions. An energy analysis of the unsteady compressible Navier-Stokes
adjoint equations indicates that adding artificial viscosity to the adjoint
equations can potentially dissipate the adjoint energy while potentially
maintain the accuracy of the adjoint sensitivities. Analyzing the growth term
of the adjoint energy provides a metric for identifying the regions in the flow
where the adjoint term is diverging. Results for the vane from simulations
performed on the Titan supercomputer are demonstrated.

correction of erasures. They have received considerable attention in recent
years due to their applications in distributed storage. Most existing results
on LRCs do not explicitly take into consideration the field size $q$, i.e., the
size of the code alphabet. In particular, for the binary case, only a few
results are known.
  In this work, we present an upper bound on the minimum distance $d$ of linear
LRCs with availability, based on the work of Cadambe and Mazumdar. The bound
takes into account the code length $n$, dimension $k$, locality $r$,
availability $t$, and field size $q$. Then, we study binary linear LRCs in
three aspects. First, we focus on analyzing the locality of some classical
codes, i.e., cyclic codes and Reed-Muller codes, and their modified versions,
which are obtained by applying the operations of extend, shorten, expurgate,
augment, and lengthen. Next, we construct LRCs using phantom parity-check
symbols and multi-level tensor product structure, respectively. Compared to
other previous constructions of binary LRCs with fixed locality or minimum
distance, our construction is much more flexible in terms of code parameters,
and gives various families of high-rate LRCs, some of which are shown to be
optimal with respect to their minimum distance. Finally, availability of LRCs
is studied. We investigate the locality and availability properties of several
classes of one-step majority-logic decodable codes, including cyclic simplex
codes, cyclic difference-set codes, and $4$-cycle free regular low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes. We also show the construction of a long LRC with

semantics and their use lies at the heart of the theory of abstract
interpretation. Yet, mechanization of Galois connections remains limited to
restricted modes of use, preventing their general application in mechanized
metatheory and certified programming.
  This paper presents constructive Galois connections, a variant of Galois
connections that is effective both on paper and in proof assistants; is
complete with respect to a large subset of classical Galois connections; and
enables more general reasoning principles, including the ""calculational"" style
advocated by Cousot.
  To design constructive Galois connection we identify a restricted mode of use
of classical ones which is both general and amenable to mechanization in
dependently-typed functional programming languages. Crucial to our metatheory
is the addition of monadic structure to Galois connections to control a
""specification effect"". Effectful calculations may reason classically, while
pure calculations have extractable computational content. Explicitly moving
between the worlds of specification and implementation is enabled by our
metatheory.
  To validate our approach, we provide two case studies in mechanizing existing
proofs from the literature: one uses calculational abstract interpretation to
design a static analyzer, the other forms a semantic basis for gradual typing.
Both mechanized proofs closely follow their original paper-and-pencil
counterparts, employ reasoning principles not captured by previous
mechanization approaches, support the extraction of verified algorithms, and
are novel.

words, asynchronous elementary cellular automata (ECA) defined using ECA rules
150 and 105. Each of these SDS defines a group action on the set $\mathbb
F_2^n$ of $n$-bit binary vectors. Because the SDS maps are products of
involutions, this relates to \emph{generalized toggle groups}, which Striker
recently defined. In this paper, we further generalize the notion of a
generalized toggle group to that of a \emph{flexible toggle group}; the SDS

  Our main result is the complete classification of the dynamics of symmetric

the SDS map of such an SDS, then we obtain an explicit formula for

$T$, then $|\text{Per}_r(T)|$ only takes at most three nonzero values.

Traditional programming models for reconfigurable logic use low-level hardware
description languages like Verilog and VHDL, which have none of the pro-

efficient designs, and low-level software lan- guages like C and OpenCL coupled
with high-level synthesis (HLS) tools that typically produce designs that are
far less efficient. Functional languages with parallel patterns are a better
fit for hardware generation because they both provide high-level abstractions

the problems faced when gen- erating hardware from imperative languages. In
this paper, we identify two optimizations that are important when using par-

general representation of tiled parallel patterns, and provide rules for
automatically tiling patterns and gen- erating metapipelines. We demonstrate

E-Commerce domain and the huge investments required to attract new customers,
firms are now giving more focus to reduce their customer churn rate. Churn rate
is the ratio of customers who part away with the firm in a specific time
period. One of the best mechanism to retain current customers is to identify
any potential churn and respond fast to prevent it. Detecting early signs of a
potential churn, recognizing what the customer is looking for by the movement
and automating personalized win back campaigns are essential to sustain
business in this era of competition. E-Commerce firms normally possess large
volume of data pertaining to their existing customers like transaction history,
search history, periodicity of purchases, etc. Data mining techniques can be
applied to analyse customer behaviour and to predict the potential customer
attrition so that special marketing strategies can be adopted to retain them.
This paper proposes an integrated model that can predict customer churn and
also recommend personalized win back actions.

control problems with dynamic, time-consistent risk constraints. Constrained
stochastic optimal control problems, which naturally arise when one has to
consider multiple objectives, have been extensively investigated in the past 20
years, however, in most formulations, the constraints are formulated as either
risk-neutral (i.e., by considering an expected cost), or by applying static,
single-period risk metrics with limited attention to ""time-consistency"" (i.e.,
to whether such metrics ensure rational consistency of risk preferences across
multiple periods). Recently, significant strides have been made in the
development of a rigorous theory of dynamic, \emph{time-consistent} risk
metrics for multi-period (risk-sensitive) decision processes, however, their
integration within constrained stochastic optimal control problems has received
little attention. The goal of this paper is to bridge this gap. First, we
formulate the stochastic optimal control problem with dynamic, time-consistent
risk constraints and we characterize the tail subproblems (which requires the
addition of a Markovian structure to the risk metrics). Second, we develop a
dynamic programming approach for its solution, which allows to compute the
optimal costs by value iteration. Finally, we discuss both theoretical and
practical features of our approach, such as generalizations, construction of
optimal control policies, and computational aspects. A simple, two-state
example is given to illustrate the problem setup and the solution approach.

amenable to implementation on embedded systems. Simulation results are

build up the links behind these three layers. These important links include an
image encoder that extracts high level info from image, a segmentation encoder
that extracts high level info from segmentation, and a hybrid decoder that
outputs semantic segmentation from the high level prior and input image. We
theoretically derive the semantic segmentation as an optimization problem

fixed to be 2, implying that the rho meson at this order is treated just like a
point-like spin-1 particle. Beyond the leading order, one finds anomalous
magnetic interactions of the charged rho meson, involving the anomalous
magnetic moment, which give corrections to the effective mass. It is then
suggested that up to O(p^4) the charged rho meson tends to become massless. Of
interest is that nontrivial magnetic-dependence of neutral mesons emerges to
give rise to the significant mixing among neutral mesons. Consequently, it
leads to the dramatic enhancement of the omega meson mass, which is testable in
future lattice simulations. Corrections from terms beyond O(p^4) are also

for various ranges of the height and width of the barrier. Our main result is a
rigorous polynomial lower bound on the minimum spectral gap for the adiabatic
evolution when the bit-symmetric cost function has a thin but polynomially high
barrier. This is accomplished by the use of a variational argument with an
improved ansatz for the ground state, along with a comparison to the spectrum
of the system when no spike term is present. We also give a more detailed
treatment of the spin coherent path-integral instanton method which was used by
Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann in arXiv:quant-ph/0201031, and consider its
applicability for estimating the gap for different scalings of barrier height
and width. We adapt the discrete WKB method for an abruptly changing potential,
and apply it to the construction of approximate wave functions which can be
used to estimate the gap. Finally, the improved ansatz for the ground state
leads to a method for predicting the location of avoided crossings in the
excited states of the energy spectrum of the thin spike Hamiltonian, and we use
a recursion relation to determine the ordering of some of these avoided
crossings, which may be a useful step towards understanding the diabatic

sentential form but whose meaning can be inferred from the dialogue context,
such as ""OK"", ""where?"", ""probably at his apartment"". The interpretation of
non-sentential utterances is an important problem in computational linguistics
since they constitute a frequent phenomena in dialogue and they are
intrinsically context-dependent. The interpretation of NSUs is the task of
retrieving their full semantic content from their form and the dialogue
context. The first half of this thesis is devoted to the NSU classification
task. Our work builds upon Fern\'andez et al. (2007) which present a series of
machine-learning experiments on the classification of NSUs. We extended their
approach with a combination of new features and semi-supervised learning
techniques. The empirical results presented in this thesis show a modest but
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art classification performance.
The consecutive, yet independent, problem is how to infer an appropriate
semantic representation of such NSUs on the basis of the dialogue context.
Fern\'andez (2006) formalizes this task in terms of ""resolution rules"" built on
top of the Type Theory with Records (TTR). Our work is focused on the
reimplementation of the resolution rules from Fern\'andez (2006) with a
probabilistic account of the dialogue state. The probabilistic rules formalism
Lison (2014) is particularly suited for this task because, similarly to the
framework developed by Ginzburg (2012) and Fern\'andez (2006), it involves the
specification of update rules on the variables of the dialogue state to capture
the dynamics of the conversation. However, the probabilistic rules can also

f_0(980)$ final state in the $\pi^-p\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^- p$ process by the
COMPASS collaboration seems unlikely to be an ordinary $\bar qq$ mesonic state.
Available theoretical explanations include tetraquark or rescattering effects
due to $a_1(1260)$ decays. If the $a_1(1420)$ were induced by the rescattering,
its production rates are completely determined by those of the $a_1(1260)$. In
this work, we propose to explore the ratios of branching fractions of heavy
meson weak decays into the $a_1(1420)$ and $a_1(1260)$, and testing the
universality of these ratios would be a straightforward way to
validate/invalidate the rescattering explanation. The decay modes include in
the charm sector the $D^0\to a_1^-\ell^+\nu$ and $D^0\to \pi^\pm a_1^\mp$, and
in the bottom sector $\overline B^0\to a_1^+ \ell^- \bar\nu$, $B\to D a_1,
\pi^\pm a_1^\mp$, $B_c\to J/\psi a_1$ and $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda_c a_1$. We
calculate the branching ratios for various decay modes into the $a_1(1260)$.
The numerical results indicate that there is a promising prospect to study
these decays on experiments including BES-III, LHCb, Babar, Belle and CLEO-c,
the forthcoming Super-KEKB factory and the under-design Circular
Electron-Positron Collider. Experimental analyses in future will lead to a
deeper understanding of the nature of the $a_1(1420)$.

are demonstrated. As a result, stable passively Q-switched EDFL pulses with
maximum output pulse energy of 23.76 nJ, repetition rate of 33.3 kHz, and pulse
width of 3.2 {\mu}s are achieved when the input pump power is 110 mW at the
wavelength of 980 nm. The laser features a low threshold pump power of ~15 mW.

important problem of data mining. Apriori is the most popular and simplest
algorithm for frequent itemset mining. To enhance the efficiency and
scalability of Apriori, a number of algorithms have been proposed addressing
the design of efficient data structures, minimizing database scan and parallel
and distributed processing. MapReduce is the emerging parallel and distributed
technology to process big datasets on Hadoop Cluster. To mine big datasets it
is essential to re-design the data mining algorithm on this new paradigm. In
this paper, we implement three variations of Apriori algorithm using data
structures hash tree, trie and hash table trie i.e. trie with hash technique on
MapReduce paradigm. We emphasize and investigate the significance of these
three data structures for Apriori algorithm on Hadoop cluster, which has not
been given attention yet. Experiments are carried out on both real life and
synthetic datasets which shows that hash table trie data structures performs
far better than trie and hash tree in terms of execution time. Moreover the
performance in case of hash tree becomes worst.

spectra in the framework of 5-dimension dynamical holographic QCD model, where
the metric structure is deformed self-consistently by the dilaton field. For
comparison, the glueball spectra are also calculated in the hard-wall and

dilaton field and glueballs, and for higher spin glueballs, we introduce a
deformed 5-dimension mass. With this set-up, there is only one free parameter
from the quadratic dilaton profile in the dynamical holographic QCD model,
which is fixed by the scalar glueball spectra. It is found that the two-gluon
glueball spectra produced in the dynamical holographic QCD model are in good
agreement with lattice data. Among six trigluon glueballs, the produced masses
for $1^{\pm -}$ and $2^{--}$ are in good agreement with lattice data, and the
produced masses for $0^{--}$, $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ are around 1.5 {\rm GeV}

mold) for solving linear programs [NTY00, IJNT11, JZ12]. These dynamics are
arrived at by a local and mechanistic interpretation of the inner workings of
the slime mold and a global optimization perspective has been lacking even in
the simplest of instances. Our first result is an interpretation of the
dynamics as an optimization process. We show that Physarum dynamics can be seen
as a steepest-descent type algorithm on a certain Riemannian manifold.
Moreover, we prove that the trajectories of Physarum are in fact paths of
optimizers to a parametrized family of convex programs, in which the objective
is a linear cost function regularized by an entropy barrier. Subsequently, we
rigorously establish several important properties of solution curves of
Physarum. We prove global existence of such solutions and show that they have
limits, being optimal solutions of the underlying LP. Finally, we show that the
discretization of the Physarum dynamics is efficient for a class of linear
programs, which include unimodular constraint matrices. Thus, together, our
results shed some light on how nature might be solving instances of perhaps the
most complex problem in P: linear programming.

repulsive confinement force density. The latter requires evaluating the
divergence of the stress tensor for the 1s solution of the Dirac equation. Such
a local force balance goes beyond the global stability criteria that are
