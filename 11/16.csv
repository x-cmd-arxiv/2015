$""$Suppose that $F_{2,m}$ is a $2$-generated associative ring with the identity
$x^m=0$. Is it true, that the nilpotency degree of $F_{2,m}$ has exponential
growth?$""$ We show that the nilpotency degree of $l$-generated associative
algebra with the identity $x^d=0$ is smaller than $\Psi(d,d,l)$, where
$\Phi(n,d,l)=l(nd)^{C\log(nd)}$ and $C$ is a constant. We give the definitive
answer to E. I. Zelmanov by this result. It is the consequence of one fact,
which is based on combinatorics of words. Let $l$, $n$ and $d\ge n$ be positive
integers. Then all the words over alphabet of cardinality $l$ which length is
greater than $\Psi(n,d,l)$ are either $n$-divided or contain $d$-th power of
subword, where a word $W$ is $n$-divided, if it can be represented in the
following form $W=W_0W_1\dots W_n$ such that $W_n\succ W_{n-1}\succ\cdots\succ
W_1$. The symbol $\succ$ means lexicographical order here. A. I. Shirshov
proved that the set of non $n$-divided words over alphabet of cardinality $l$
has bounded height $h$ over the set $Y$ consisting of all the words of degree
$<n$. Original Shirshov's estimation was just recursive, in 1982 double
exponent was obtained by A. G. Kolotov and in 1993 A. Ya. Belov obtained
exponential estimation. We show, that $h<\Phi(n,l)$, where $\Phi(n,l)=n^{C\log
n} l$ and $C$ is a constant. Our proof uses Latyshev idea of Dilworth theorem

locations surrounding the vacuum vessel. The resolution of this inverse problem
takes two steps. In the first one we transform the set of measurements into
Cauchy conditions on a fixed contour $\Gamma\_O$ close to the measurement
points. This is done by least square fitting a truncated series of toroidal
harmonic functions to the measurements. The second step consists in solving a
Cauchy problem for the elliptic equation satisfied by the flux in the vacuum
and for the overdetermined boundary conditions on $\Gamma\_O$ previously
obtained with the help of toroidal harmonics. It is reformulated as an optimal
control problem on a fixed annular domain of external boundary $\Gamma\_O$ and
fictitious inner boundary $\Gamma\_I$. A regularized Kohn-Vogelius cost
function depending on the value of the flux on $\Gamma\_I$ and measuring the
discrepency between the solution to the equation satisfied by the flux obtained
using Dirichlet conditions on $\Gamma\_O$ and the one obtained using Neumann

of a software, called VacTH-KV, which enables plasma boundary reconstruction in

reach higher solar cell efficiencies becomes ever more difficult as they
approach the limiting efficiency. The so-called third generation concepts
attempt to break this limit through a combination of novel physical processes
and new materials and concepts in organic and inorganic systems. Some examples
of semi-empirical modelling in the field are reviewed, in particular for
multispectral solar cells on silicon (french ANR project MULTISOLSI). Their
achievements are outlined, and the limits of these approaches shown. This
introduces the main topic of this contribution, which is the use of multiscale
experimental and theoretical techniques to go beyond the semi-empirical
understanding of these systems. This approach has already led to great advances
at modelling which have led to modelling software which is widely known. Yet a
survey of the topic reveals a fragmentation of efforts across disciplines,
firstly, such as organic and inorganic fields, but also between the high
efficiency concepts such as hot carrier cells and intermediate band concepts.
We show how this obstacle to the resolution of practical research obstacles may
be lifted by inter-disciplinary cooperation across length scales, and across
experimental and theoretical fields, and finally across materials systems. We
present a European COST Action MultiscaleSolar kicking off in early 2015 which
brings together experimental and theoretical partners in order to develop
multiscale research in organic and inorganic materials. The goal of this
defragmentation and interdisciplinary collaboration is to develop understanding
across length scales which will enable the full potential of third generation
concepts to be evaluated in practise, for societal and industrial applications.

which both the high order spatial reconstruction as well as the time evolution
of the reconstruction polynomials in the local space-time predictor stage are
performed in primitive variables, rather than in conserved ones. Since the
underlying finite volume scheme is still written in terms of cell averages of
the conserved quantities, our new approach performs the spatial WENO
reconstruction twice: the first WENO reconstruction is carried out on the known
cell averages of the conservative variables. The WENO polynomials are then used
at the cell centers to compute point values of the conserved variables, which
are converted into point values of the primitive variables. A second WENO
reconstruction is performed on the point values of the primitive variables to
obtain piecewise high order reconstruction polynomials of the primitive
variables. The reconstruction polynomials are subsequently evolved in time with
a novel space-time finite element predictor that is directly applied to the
governing PDE written in primitive form. We have verified the validity of the
new approach over the classical Euler equations of gas dynamics, the special
relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) and ideal magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD)
equations, as well as the Baer-Nunziato model for compressible two-phase flows.
In all cases we have noticed that the new ADER schemes provide less oscillatory
solutions when compared to ADER finite volume schemes based on the
reconstruction in conserved variables, especially for the RMHD and the
Baer-Nunziato equations. For the RHD and RMHD equations, the accuracy is
improved and the CPU time is reduced by about 25%. We recommend to use this
version of ADER as the standard one in the relativistic framework. The new
approach can be extended to ADER-DG schemes on space-time adaptive grids.

chimera states for SPPs, i.e., one group of particles synchronizes while others
wander around chaotically. Compared to chimeras in coupled oscillators where
the site position is fixed, SPPs give rise to new distinctive forms of chimeric

valuations over n heterogeneous, independent items. It is known that in this
important setting optimal mechanisms may require randomization [HR12], use
menus of infinite size [DDT15], and may be computationally intractable [DDT14].
This has sparked recent interest in finding simple mechanisms that obtain
reasonable approximations to the optimal revenue [HN12, LY13, BILW14]. In this
work we attempt to find the optimal simple mechanism.
  There are many ways to define simple mechanisms. Here we restrict our search
to partition mechanisms, where the seller partitions the items into disjoint
bundles and posts a price for each bundle; the buyer is allowed to buy any
number of bundles.
  We give a PTAS for the problem of finding a revenue-maximizing partition
mechanism, and prove that the problem is strongly NP-hard. En route, we prove
structural properties of near-optimal partition mechanisms which may be of
independent interest: for example, there always exists a near-optimal partition
mechanism that uses only a constant number of non-trivial bundles (i.e. bundles
with more than one item).

alternative point of view to the usual indicators for inclusion of covariates
in a given model. Assumptions about indicator variables often lead to
Beta-Binomial priors on the model space, which do not appropriately penalize
for model complexity when the parameters are fixed. This can be alleviated by
changing the parameters of the prior to depend on the number of covariates,
though justification for this is lacking from a first-principles point of view.
We propose viewing the model space as a partially ordered set. When the number
of covariates increases, an isometry argument leads to the Poisson distribution
as the unique, natural limiting prior over model dimension. This limiting prior
is derived using two constructions that view an individual model as though it
is a ""local"" null hypothesis and compares its prior probability to the
probability of the alternatives that nest it. We show that this prior induces a
posterior that concentrates on a finite true model asymptotically.
Additionally, we provide a deterministic algorithm that takes advantage of the
nature of the prior and explores good models in polynomial time.

October 2014. ABS observed the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) at large
angular scales ($40<\ell<500$) to limit the B-mode polarization spectrum around
the primordial B-mode peak from inflationary gravity waves at $\ell \sim100$.
The ABS focal plane consists of 480 transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers.
They are coupled to orthogonal polarizations from a planar ortho-mode
transducer (OMT) and observe at 145 GHz. ABS employs an ambient-temperature,
rapidly rotating half-wave plate (HWP) to mitigate systematic effects and move
the signal band away from atmospheric $1/f$ noise, allowing for the recovery of
large angular scales. We discuss how the signal at the second harmonic of the
HWP rotation frequency can be used for data selection and for monitoring the

allocation, collective regulation, mass action responses, have been considered

(a) the average internal response threshold for each task (the internal
factor); (b) social network communications that could lead to task switching
(the environmental factor); and (c) dynamical changes of task demands (the
external factor). Since workers in many social insect species exhibit \emph{age
polyethism}, we also extend our model to incorporate \emph{age polyethism} in
which worker task preferences change with age. We apply our general modeling
framework to the cases of two task groups: the inside colony task versus the
outside colony task. Our analytical study of the models provides important
insights and predictions on the effects of colony size, social communication,
and age related task preferences on task allocation and division of labor in
the adaptive dynamical environment. Our study implies that the smaller size
colony invests its resource for the colony growth and allocates more workers in
the risky tasks such as foraging while the larger colony shifts more workers to
perform the safer tasks inside the colony. Social interactions among different
task groups play an important role in shaping task allocation depending on the
relative cost and demands of the tasks.

objective, it involves solving an $N\times N$ eigenvalue system where $N$ is
the training set size, making its computational requirements in both memory and
time prohibitive for large-scale problems. Various approximation techniques
have been developed for KCCA. A commonly used approach is to first transform
the original inputs to an $M$-dimensional random feature space so that inner
products in the feature space approximate kernel evaluations, and then apply
linear CCA to the transformed inputs. In many applications, however, the
dimensionality $M$ of the random feature space may need to be very large in
order to obtain a sufficiently good approximation; it then becomes challenging
to perform the linear CCA step on the resulting very high-dimensional data

presence of a TSS in epitaxially grown thin films of the half-Heusler compound
PtLuSb. Spin and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES),
complemented by theoretical calculations, reveals a surface state with linear
dispersion and a helical tangential spin texture consistent with previous

step forward in establishing half-Heusler compounds as a viable material system
for future spintronics devices.

decrease together with increasing age, while maintaining rough proportionality.

communication. However mutual aid is made difficult by the problems of
coordinating diverse norms and preferences, and communication is harried by
substantial ambiguity in meaning. Here we demonstrate that these two facts can
work together to allow cooperation to develop, by the strategic use of
deliberately ambiguous signals, covert signaling. Covert signaling is the
transmission of information that is accurately received by its intended
audience but obscured when perceived by others. Such signals may allow
coordination and enhanced cooperation while also avoiding the alienation or
hostile reactions of individuals with different preferences. Although the
empirical literature has identified potential mechanisms of covert signaling,
such as encryption in humor, there is to date no formal theory of its dynamics.
We introduce a novel mathematical model to assess the conditions under which a
covert signaling strategy will be favored. We show that covert signaling
plausibly serves an important function in facilitating within-group cooperative
assortment by allowing individuals to pair up with similar individuals when
possible and to get along with dissimilar individuals when necessary. This
mechanism has broad implications for theories of signaling and cooperation,
humor, social identity, and the evolution of human cultural complexity.

The problem is tackled by adjusting initial conditions to bring all stable
modes closer to observations and by using a continuous guide to direct unstable
modes toward a reference time series. This interpretation provides a consistent
and effective procedure for solving problems of long-term state estimation. By
applying this approach to an ocean general circulation model with a
parameterized vertical diffusion procedure, it is demonstrated that tangent
linear and adjoint models in this framework should have no unstable modes and
hence be suitable for tracking persistent signals. This methodology is widely

observing a dynamical process, where sensors transmit local state estimates
over an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) packet dropping
channel to a remote estimator. At every discrete time instant, the remote
estimator decides whether each sensor should transmit or not, with each sensor
transmission incurring a fixed energy cost. The channel is shared such that
collisions will occur if more than one sensor transmits at a time. Performance
is quantified via an optimization problem that minimizes a convex combination
of the expected estimation error covariance at the remote estimator and
expected energy usage across the sensors. For transmission schedules dependent
only on the estimation error covariance at the remote estimator, this work
establishes structural results on the optimal scheduling which show that 1) for
unstable systems, if the error covariance is large then a sensor will always be
scheduled to transmit, and 2) there is a threshold-type behaviour in switching
from one sensor transmitting to another. Specializing to the single sensor
case, these structural results demonstrate that a threshold policy (i.e.
transmit if the error covariance exceeds a certain threshold and don't transmit
otherwise) is optimal. We also consider the situation where sensors transmit
measurements instead of state estimates, and establish structural results
including the optimality of threshold policies for the single sensor, scalar
case. These results provide a theoretical justification for the use of such
threshold policies in variance based event triggered estimation. Numerical
studies confirm the qualitative behaviour predicted by our structural results.
An extension of the structural results to Markovian packet drops is also
outlined.

re-examined the X-ray spectral and timing properties of the M101 ULS using
archival Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. We show that the X-ray
time-variability and spectral properties are inconsistent with standard disk
emission. The characteristic radius R_{bb} of the thermal emitter varies from
epoch to epoch between ~10,000 km and ~100,000 km; the colour temperature
kT_{bb} varies between ~50 eV and ~140 eV; and the two quantities scale
approximately as R_{bb} ~ T_{bb}^{-2}. In addition to the smooth continuum, we
also find (at some epochs) spectral residuals well fitted with thermal plasma
models and absorption edges: we interpret this as evidence that we are looking
at a clumpy, multi-temperature outflow. We suggest that at sufficiently high
accretion rates and inclination angles, the super-critical, radiatively driven
outflow becomes effectively optically thick and completely thermalizes the
harder X-ray photons from the inner part of the inflow, removing the hard
spectral tail. We develop a simple, spherically symmetric outflow model and
show that it is consistent with the observed temperatures, radii and
luminosities. A larger, cooler photosphere shifts the emission peak into the
far-UV and makes the source dimmer in X-rays but possibly ultraluminous in the
UV. We compare our results and interpretation with those of Liu et al. (2013).

unstructured nature of user-generated content and the sparsity of video frames
expressing emotion. In this paper, for the first time, we study the problem of
transferring knowledge from heterogeneous external sources, including image and
textual data, to facilitate three related tasks in understanding video emotion:
emotion recognition, emotion attribution and emotion-oriented summarization.
Specifically, our framework (1) learns a video encoding from an auxiliary
emotional image dataset in order to improve supervised video emotion
recognition, and (2) transfers knowledge from an auxiliary textual corpora for
zero-shot recognition of emotion classes unseen during training. The proposed
technique for knowledge transfer facilitates novel applications of emotion
attribution and emotion-oriented summarization. A comprehensive set of
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework.

damping constant {\alpha}eff is often determined experimentally from the
spectral linewidth of the free induction decay of the magnetization after the
system is excited to its non-equilibrium state. Such an {\alpha}eff, however,
reflects both intrinsic damping as well as inhomogeneous broadening. In this
paper we compare measurements of the magnetization dynamics in ultrathin
non-epitaxial films having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy using two
different techniques, time-resolved magneto optical Kerr effect (TRMOKE) and
hybrid optical-electrical ferromagnetic resonance (OFMR). By using an external
magnetic field that is applied at very small angles to the film plane in the
TRMOKE studies, we develop an explicit closed-form analytical expression for
the TRMOKE spectral linewidth and show how this can be used to reliably extract
the intrinsic Gilbert damping constant. The damping constant determined in this
way is in excellent agreement with that determined from the OFMR method on the
same samples. Our studies indicate that the asymptotic high-field approach that
is often used in the TRMOKE method to distinguish the intrinsic damping from
the effective damping may result in significant error, because such high
external magnetic fields are required to make this approach valid that they are
out of reach. The error becomes larger the lower is the intrinsic damping
constant, and thus may account for the anomalously high damping constants that
are often reported in TRMOKE studies. In conventional ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR) studies, inhomogeneous contributions can be readily distinguished from
intrinsic damping contributions from the magnetic field dependence of the FMR
linewidth. Using the analogous approach, we show how reliable values of the
intrinsic damping can be extracted from TRMOKE.

ameliorate the performance of the existing methods, there are always some new
classification procedures proposed. These procedures, especially those raised
in the machine learning and data-mining literature, are usually complicated,
and therefore extra effort is required to understand them and the impacts of
individual variables in these procedures. However, in some applications, for
example, pharmaceutical and medical related research, future developments
and/or research plans will rely on the interpretation of the classification
rule, such as the role of individual variables in a diagnostic rule/model.
Hence, in these kinds of research, despite the optimal performance of the
complicated models, the model with the balanced ease of interpretability and
satisfactory performance is preferred. The complication of a classification
rule might diminish its advantage in performance and become an obstacle to be
used in those applications. In this paper, we study how to improve the
classification performance, in terms of area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve of a conventional logistic model, while retaining its ease
of interpretation. The proposed method increases the sensitivity at the whole
range of specificity and hence is especially useful when the performance in the
high-specificity range of a receiver operating characteristic curve is of
interest. Theoretical justification is presented, and numerical results using

representation approach by constructing mid-level words in videos and encoding
them on Riemannian manifold. Specifically, we first conduct a global alignment
on the densely extracted low-level features to build a bank of corresponding
feature groups, each of which can be statistically modeled as a mid-level word
lying on some specific Riemannian manifold. Based on these mid-level words, we
construct intrinsic Riemannian codebooks by employing K-Karcher-means

Riemannian manifold version of three well studied encoding methods in Euclidean
space, i.e. Bag of Visual Words (BoVW), Vector of Locally Aggregated

vehicles on a highway segment with connected and automated vehicles. This
problem is complex because each vehicle trajectory is an infinite-dimensional
object and neighboring trajectories have complex interactions (e.g.,
car-following behavior). A parsimonious shooting heuristic algorithm is
proposed to construct vehicle trajectories on a signalized highway segment that
comply with boundary conditions for vehicle arrivals, vehicle mechanical
limits, traffic lights and vehicle following safety. This algorithm breaks each
vehicle trajectory into a few sections and each is analytically solvable. This
decomposes the original hard trajectory control problem to a simple
constructive heuristic. Then we slightly adapt this shooting heuristic
algorithm to efficiently solve a leading vehicle problem on an uninterrupted
freeway. To study theoretical properties of the proposed algorithms, the time
geography theory is generalized by considering finite accelerations. With this
generalized theory, it is found that under mild conditions, these algorithms
can always obtain a feasible solution to the original complex trajectory
control problem. Further, we discover that the shooting heuristic solution is a
generalization of the solution to the classic kinematic wave theory by
incorporating finite accelerations. We identify the theoretical bounds to the
difference between the shooting heuristic solution and the kinematic wave
solution. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results
and to draw additional insights into the potential of trajectory control in
improving traffic performance. Building upon this foundation, an optimization
framework will be presented in a following paper as Part II of this study.

distances, thus imposing a new constraint on trap miniaturization. By means of
a free induction decay experiment, we measure the dephasing time of the motion

times we extract the integrated noise below the secular frequency of the ion.
We find that none of the most commonly discussed surface noise models for ion

2.9 mm exhibit a multiple ring-like gap structure in the circumstellar disk.
Assuming that the observed gaps are opened up by currently forming, unseen
bodies, we estimate the mass of such hypothetical bodies based on following two
approaches; the Hill radius analysis and a more elaborated approach developed
from the angular momentum transfer analysis in gas disks. For the former, the
measured gap widths are used for calibrating the mass of the bodies, while for
the latter, the measured gap depths are utilized. We show that their masses are
likely comparable to or less than the mass of Jovian planets, and then discuss
an origin of the observed gap structure. By evaluating Toomre's gravitational
instability (GI) condition and cooling effect, we find that the GI might be a
possible mechanism to form the bodies in the outer region of the disk. As the
disk might be gravitationally unstable only in the outer region of the disk,
inward planetary migration would be needed to construct the current
architecture of the hypothetical bodies. We estimate the gap-opening mass and
show that type II migration might be able to play such a role. Combining GIs
with inward migration, we conjecture that all of the observed gaps may be a
consequence of bodies that might have originally formed at the outer part of
the disk, and have subsequently migrated to the current locations. While ALMA's
unprecedented high spatial resolution observations can revolutionize our
picture of planet formation, more dedicated observational and theoretical

Neural Programmer can call these augmented operations over several steps,
thereby inducing compositional programs that are more complex than the built-in
operations. The model learns from a weak supervision signal which is the result
of execution of the correct program, hence it does not require expensive
annotation of the correct program itself. The decisions of what operations to
call, and what data segments to apply to are inferred by Neural Programmer.
Such decisions, during training, are done in a differentiable fashion so that

coding was originally designed to be a low-complexity recursive channel
combining and splitting operation of this type, to be used as the inner code in
a concatenated scheme with outer convolutional coding and sequential decoding.
However, the polar inner code turned out to be so effective that no outer code

technique for finding correlated variables in multi-view data. Several
nonlinear extensions of the original linear CCA have been proposed, including
kernel and deep neural network methods. These approaches seek maximally
correlated projections among families of functions, which the user specifies
(by choosing a kernel or neural network structure), and are computationally
demanding. Interestingly, the theory of nonlinear CCA, without functional
restrictions, had been studied in the population setting by Lancaster already
in the 1950s, but these results have not inspired practical algorithms. We
revisit Lancaster's theory to devise a practical algorithm for nonparametric
CCA (NCCA). Specifically, we show that the solution can be expressed in terms
of the singular value decomposition of a certain operator associated with the
joint density of the views. Thus, by estimating the population density from
data, NCCA reduces to solving an eigenvalue system, superficially like kernel
CCA but, importantly, without requiring the inversion of any kernel matrix. We
also derive a partially linear CCA (PLCCA) variant in which one of the views
undergoes a linear projection while the other is nonparametric. Using a kernel
density estimate based on a small number of nearest neighbors, our NCCA and
PLCCA algorithms are memory-efficient, often run much faster, and perform
better than kernel CCA and comparable to deep CCA.

  Strategy for TDD/FDD Massive MIMO Systems",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a new transmission strategy for the multiuser massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, including uplink/downlink
channel estimation and user scheduling for data transmission. A discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) aided spatial basis expansion model (SBEM) is first
introduced to represent the uplink/downlink channels with much few parameter
dimensions by exploiting angle reciprocity and the physical characteristics of
the uniform linear array (ULA). With SBEM, both uplink and downlink channel
estimation of multiuser can be carried out with very few amount of training
resources, which significantly reduces the training overhead and feedback cost.
Meanwhile, the pilot contamination problem in the uplink raining is immediately
relieved by exploiting the spatial information of users. To enhance the
spectral efficiency and to fully utilize the spatial resources, we also design
a greedy user scheduling scheme during the data transmission period. Compared
to existing low-rank models, the newly proposed SBEM offers an alternative for
channel acquisition without need of channel statistics for both TDD and FDD
systems based on the angle reciprocity. Moreover, the proposed method can be
efficiently deployed by the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Various numerical
results are provided to corroborate the proposed studies.

technique a thin noble metal film on a dielectric substrate is irradiated by a
tightly focused single nanosecond laser pulse and then the modified region is
slowly polished by an accelerated argon ion (Ar+) beam. As a result, each
nanosecond laser pulse locally modifies the initial metal film through
initiation of fast melting and subsequent hydrodynamic processes, while the
following Ar+-ion polishing removes the rest of the film, revealing the hidden
topography features and fabricating separate plasmonic structures on the glass
substrate. We demonstrate that the shape and lateral size of the resulting
functional plasmonic nanostructures depends on the laser pulse energy and metal
film thickness, while subsequent Ar+-ion polishing enables to vary height of
the resulting nanostructures. The plasmonic properties of the fabricated

supporting numerical calculations of the related electromagnetic near-fields

checking rich data structure invariants expressed as separation logic
assertions. Incremental verification-validation combines static verification of
separation properties with efficient, short-circuiting dynamic validation of
arbitrarily rich data constraints. A data structure invariant checker is an
inductive predicate in separation logic with an executable interpretation; a
short-circuiting checker is an invariant checker that stops checking whenever
it detects at run time that an assertion for some sub-structure has been fully
proven statically. At a high level, our approach does two things: it statically
proves the separation properties of data structure invariants using a static
shape analysis in a standard way but then leverages this proof in a novel
manner to synthesize short-circuiting dynamic validation of the data
properties. As a consequence, we enable dynamic validation to make up for
imprecision in sound static analysis while simultaneously leveraging the static
verification to make the remaining dynamic validation efficient. We show
empirically that short-circuiting can yield asymptotic improvements in dynamic
validation, with low overhead over no validation, even in cases where static
verification is incomplete.

the PSCz model provides a better fit to the 2MTF velocity field data than does
the 2MRS model, and provides a value of $\beta$ in greater agreement with
literature values. However, when we subtract away the monopole deviation in the
velocity zeropoint between data and model, the 2MRS model also produces a value
of $\beta$ in agreement with literature values. We also calculate the `residual
bulk flow': the component of the bulk flow not accounted for by the models.
This is $\sim 250$ km/s when performing the standard fit, but drops to $\sim
150$ km/s for both models when the aforementioned monopole offset between data

expectations, and suggests that the models largely account for the major

({\Lambda}_s) substrate (e.g., {\Lambda}_cross/{\Lambda}_s>20) are challenging,
due to the low thermal resistance of the thin film compared to that of the
substrate. In principle, {\Lambda}_cross could be measured by time-domain
thermoreflectance (TDTR), using a high modulation frequency f_h and a large
laser spot size. However, with one TDTR measurement at f_h, the uncertainty of
the TDTR measurement is usually high due to low sensitivity of TDTR signals to
{\Lambda}_cross and high sensitivity to the thickness h_Al of Al transducer
deposited on the sample for TDTR measurements. We observe that in most TDTR
measurements, the sensitivity to h_Al only depends weakly on the modulation
frequency f. Thus, we performed an additional TDTR measurement at a low
modulation frequency f_0, such that the sensitivity to h_Al is comparable but
the sensitivity to {\Lambda}cross is near zero. We then analyze the ratio of
the TDTR signals at f_h to that at f_0, and thus significantly improve the
accuracy of our {\Lambda}cross measurements. As a demonstration of the
dual-frequency approach, we measured the cross-plane thermal conductivity of a
400-nm-thick nickel-iron alloy film and a 3-{\mu}m-thick Cu film, both with an
accuracy of ~10%. The dual-frequency TDTR approach is useful for future studies

covering both finite- and infinite-dimensional measurements. These ideas are
then extended to incorporate quantum correlations between the observed object

The decay rate exponentially depends on the bounce action. The bounce action

scale-independent, radiative corrections, which are due to the field

that the inclusion of the fluctuations suppresses the scale dependence, and

convective turbulent flows in a cylindrical Rayleigh-Benard convection cell
with two immiscible fluids, water and fluorinert FC-77 electronic liquid
(FC77). It is found that one large-scale circulation (LSC) roll exists in each
of the fluid layers, and that their circulation planes have two preferred
azimuthal orientations separated by $\sim\pi$. A surprising finding of the
study is that cessations/reversals of the LSC in FC77 of the two-layer system
occur much more frequently than they do in single-layer turbulent RBC, and that
a cessation is most likely to result in a flow reversal of the LSC, which is in
sharp contrast with the uniform distribution of the orientational angular
change of the LSC before and after cessations in single-layer turbulent RBC.
This implies that the dynamics governing cessations and reversals in the two
systems are very different. Two coupling modes, thermal coupling (flow
directions of the two LSCs are opposite to each other at the fluid-fluid
interface) and viscous coupling (flow directions of the two LSCs are the same
at the fluid-fluid interface), are identified with the former one as the
predominant mode. That most cessations (in the FC77 layer) end up as reversals
can be understood as a symmetry breaking imposed by the orientation of the LSC
in the water layer, which remained unchanged most of the time. Furthermore, the
frequently occurring cessations and reversals are caused by the system
switching between its two metastable states, i.e. thermal and viscous coupling
modes. It is also observed that the strength of the LSC in water becomes weaker
when the LSC in FC77 rotates faster azimuthally and that the flow strength in
FC77 becomes stronger when the LSC in water rotates faster azimuthally, i.e.
the influence of the LSC in one fluid layer on the other is not symmetric.

sequence conditioned on an entire input sequence. In this paper, we present a
Neural Transducer that can make incremental predictions as more input arrives,
without redoing the entire computation. Unlike sequence-to-sequence models, the
Neural Transducer computes the next-step distribution conditioned on the
partially observed input sequence and the partially generated sequence. At each
time step, the transducer can decide to emit zero to many output symbols. The
data can be processed using an encoder and presented as input to the
transducer. The discrete decision to emit a symbol at every time step makes it
difficult to learn with conventional backpropagation. It is however possible to
train the transducer by using a dynamic programming algorithm to generate
target discrete decisions. Our experiments show that the Neural Transducer
works well in settings where it is required to produce output predictions as
data come in. We also find that the Neural Transducer performs well for long

ladders to be calculated to within 0.1 km s$^{-1}$ in radial velocity up to 400
GHz. Conclusive evidence for the identification of the two astronomical lines
of HDCCC was provided by the $V_{\rm{LSR}}$ which is the same as that of the
normal isotopic species (H$_2$CCC) in the three narrow line sources. In these
sources, deuterium fractionation in singly substituted H$_2$CCC (HDCCC/H$_2$CCC
$\sim4\%\text{-}19\%$) is comparable to that in $c$-C$_3$H$_2$
($c$-C$_3$H$_2$/$c$-C$_3$HD $\sim5\%\text{-}17\%$), and similarly in doubly
deuterated $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ ($c$-C$_3$D$_2$/$c$-C$_3$HD $\sim3\%\text{-}17\%$),
implying that the efficiency of the deuteration processes in the H$_2$CCC and
$c$-C$_3$H$_2$ isomers are comparable in dark clouds.

orbits is huge, while as the value of the energy increases the orbits escape
more quickly to infinity. Furthermore, initial conditions of orbits located
near the boundaries of the basins of escape and also in the vicinity of the

the fractality of the phase space was calculated as a function of the value of

to localize the sources underlying a measured EEG, the electric potential
distribution at the electrodes generated by a dipolar current source in the
brain has to be simulated, which is the so-called EEG forward problem. To solve
it accurately, it is necessary to apply numerical methods that are able to take
the individual geometry and conductivity distribution of the subject's head
into account. In this context, the finite element method (FEM) has shown high
numerical accuracy with the possibility to model complex geometries and
conductive features, e.g., white matter conductivity anisotropy. In this
article, we introduce and analyze the application of a discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) method, a finite element method that includes features of the finite
volume framework, to the EEG forward problem. The DG-FEM approach fulfills the
conservation property of electric charge also in the discrete case, making it
attractive for a variety of applications. Furthermore, as we show, this
approach can alleviate modeling inaccuracies that might occur in head
geometries when using classical FE methods, e.g., so-called ""skull leakage
effects"", which may occur in areas where the thickness of the skull is in the
range of the mesh resolution. Therefore, we derive a DG formulation of the FEM
subtraction approach for the EEG forward problem and present numerical results
that highlight the advantageous features and the potential benefits of the
proposed approach.

picture, complemented by elementary asymptotic formulae, of a nonlocal
mechanism for plasmon-redshift saturation at subnanometric gap widths. Thus, by
considering the electron-charge and field distributions in the close vicinity
of the metal-vacuum interface, we show that nonlocality is asymptotically
manifested as an effective potential discontinuity. For bonding modes in the
near-contact limit, the latter discontinuity is shown to be effectively
equivalent to a widening of the gap. As a consequence, the resonance-frequency
near-contact asymptotics are a renormalisation of the corresponding local ones.
Specifically, the renormalisation furnishes an asymptotic plasmon-frequency
lower bound that scales with the $1/4$-power of the Fermi wavelength. We
demonstrate these remarkable features in the prototypical cases of nanowire and
nanosphere dimers, showing agreement between our elementary expressions and

varying background effect of microlensing. This model not only matches
noticeably well the global shape of each of the three independent microlensing

The measured average half-light radius, $R_{1/2}=(3.0\pm

three events, the core of the magnification profile exhibits ""fine structure""

Relativistic beaming at the internal rim of the accretion disk can explain the

also possible. This is the first direct measurement of the size of a structure,
likely the innermost stable circular orbit, at $\sim 3$ Schwarzschild radii in

challenged by the small effects size and the ensuing lack of power, an issue
that has incited researchers to rely more systematically on large cohorts.
Coupled with resolution increases, this leads to very large datasets. A
striking example in the case of brain imaging is that of the Human Connectome
Project: 20 Terabytes of data and growing. The resulting data deluge poses
severe challenges regarding the tractability of some processing steps
(discriminant analysis, multivariate models) due to the memory demands posed by
these data. In this work, we revisit dimension reduction approaches, such as
random projections, with the aim of replacing costly function evaluations by
cheaper ones while decreasing the memory requirements. Specifically, we
investigate the use of alternate schemes, based on fast clustering, that are
well suited for signals exhibiting a strong spatial structure, such as
anatomical and functional brain images. Our contribution is twofold: i) we
propose a linear-time clustering scheme that bypasses the percolation issues
inherent in these algorithms and thus provides compressions nearly as good as
traditional quadratic-complexity variance-minimizing clustering schemes, ii) we
show that cluster-based compression can have the virtuous effect of removing
high-frequency noise, actually improving subsequent estimations steps. As a
consequence, the proposed approach yields very accurate models on several
large-scale problems yet with impressive gains in computational efficiency,
making it possible to analyze large datasets.

sine-Gordon equation driven by an oscillating field and subject to an external
non-Gaussian noise. A wide range of $\alpha$-stable L\'evy distributions is
considered as noise source, with varying stability index $\alpha$ and asymmetry
parameter $\beta$. In junctions longer than a critical length, the mean
switching time (MST) from superconductive to the resistive state assumes a
values independent of the device length. Here, we demonstrate that such a value
is directly related to the mean density of solitons which move into or from the
washboard potential minimum corresponding to the initial superconductive state.
Moreover, we observe: (i) a connection between the total mean soliton density
and the mean potential difference across the junction; (ii) an inverse behavior
of the mean voltage in comparison with the MST, with varying the junction
length; (iii) evidences of non-monotonic behaviors, such as stochastic resonant
activation and noise enhanced stability, of MST versus the driving frequency

these non-monotonic behaviors are found to be related to the mean density of
solitons formed along the junction.

with the corresponding escape periods of the orbits is undoubtedly an issue of
paramount importance. We consider four different cases depending on the
perturbation function which controls the number of escape channels on the
configuration space. In every case, we computed extensive samples of orbits in
both the configuration and the phase space by numerically integrating the
equations of motion as well as the variational equations. It was found that in
all examined cases regions of non-escaping motion coexist with several basins
of escape. The larger escape periods have been measured for orbits with initial
conditions in the vicinity of the fractal structure, while the lowest escape
rates belong to orbits with initial conditions inside the basins of escape. In
addition, we related the model potential with applications in the field of
reactive multichannel scattering. We hope that our numerical analysis will be

the alternative theoretical H2 formula leads to a negative offset in
M_HI/M_star of up to 0.5 dex. Visual inspection reveals that most HI disks in
simulated HI-rich galaxies are vertically disturbed, plausibly due to recent
accretion events. Many galaxies (up to 80 per cent) contain spuriously large HI
holes, which are likely formed as a consequence of the feedback implementation
in EAGLE. The HI mass-size relation of all simulated galaxies is close to (but
16 per cent steeper than) observed, and when only galaxies without large holes
in the HI disc are considered, the agreement becomes excellent (better than 0.1
dex). The presence of large HI holes also makes the radial HI surface density
profiles somewhat too low in the centre, at \Sigma_HI > 1 M_Sun pc^-2 (by a
factor of <~ 2 compared to data from the Bluedisk survey). In the outer region
(\Sigma_HI < 1 M_Sun pc^-2), the simulated profiles agree quantitatively with

randomly occur in synchronized flow (S) at a highway bottleneck. The
development of such a traffic flow instability leads to free flow (F) at the
bottleneck; therefore, we call this instability as an S$\rightarrow$F
instability. Whereas the S$\rightarrow$F instability leads to a local {\it
increase in speed} (growing acceleration wave), in contrast, the classical
traffic flow instability introduced in 50s--60s and incorporated later in a
huge number of traffic flow models leads to a growing wave of a local {\it
decrease in speed} (growing deceleration wave). We have found that the
S$\rightarrow$F instability can occur only, if there is a finite time delay in
driver over-acceleration. The initial speed disturbance of increase in speed
(called ""speed peak"") that initiates the S$\rightarrow$F instability occurs
usually at the downstream front of synchronized flow at the bottleneck. There
can be many speed peaks with random amplitudes that occur randomly over time.
It has been found that the S$\rightarrow$F instability exhibits the nucleation
nature: Only when a speed peak amplitude is large enough, the S$\rightarrow$F
instability occurs; in contrast, speed peaks of smaller amplitudes cause
dissolving speed waves of a local increase in speed(dissolving acceleration
waves) in synchronized flow. We have found that the S$\rightarrow$F instability
governs traffic breakdown -- a phase transition from free flow to synchronized
flow (F$\rightarrow$S transition) at the bottleneck: The nucleation nature of
the S$\rightarrow$F instability explains the metastability of free flow with
respect to an F$\rightarrow$S Transition at the bottleneck.

long-range electron-electron interaction. We apply our method to the
single-quasiparticle spectrum of the (3,3) armchair nanotube configuration, and
consider the effects of strong electron-electron correlations. Our approach is
equally applicable to other nanotubes, as well as to other carbon
nanostructures. We benchmark our Monte Carlo calculations against the two- and
four-site Hubbard models, where a direct numerical solution is feasible.

However, such planets may be subject to extreme conditions due to possible high
stellar activity. The goal of this work is to determine the potential effect of
stellar cosmic rays on key atmospheric species of Earth-like planets orbiting
in the habitable zone of M-dwarf stars and show corresponding changes in the
planetary spectra. We build upon the cosmic rays model scheme of Grenfell et
al. (2012), who considered cosmic ray induced NOx production, by adding further
cosmic ray induced production mechanisms (e.g. for HOx) and introducing primary
protons of a wider energy range (16 MeV - 0.5 TeV). Previous studies suggested
that planets in the habitable zone that are subject to strong flaring
conditions have high atmospheric methane concentrations, while their ozone
biosignature is completely destroyed. Our current study shows, however, that
adding cosmic ray induced HOx production can cause a decrease in atmospheric
methane abundance of up to 80\%. Furthermore, the cosmic ray induced HOx
molecules react with NOx to produce HNO$_3$, which produces strong HNO$_3$
signals in the theoretical spectra and reduces NOx-induced catalytic
destruction of ozone so that more than 25\% of the ozone column remains. Hence,
an ozone signal remains visible in the theoretical spectrum (albeit with a
weaker intensity) when incorporating the new cosmic ray induced NOx and HOx
schemes, even for a constantly flaring M-star case. We also find that HNO$_3$
levels may be high enough to be potentially detectable. Since ozone
concentrations, which act as the key shield against harmful UV radiation, are
affected by cosmic rays via NOx-induced catalytic destruction of ozone, the
impact of stellar cosmic rays on surface UV fluxes is also studied.

described in terms of the effective interaction between the centers of mass of

effective pair potential is {\em finite} at the origin, allowing ""particles"" to
freely interpenetrate each other. Using a double-Gaussian model (DGM) for
demonstration, we studied the behavior of the system as a function of the
attraction strength $\eta$. Above a critical strength $\eta_{\rm c}$, the
infinite-size system is Ruelle-unstable, in that it collapses to a cluster of
finite volume. As $\eta_{\rm c}$ is approached from below, the liquid-vapor
region exhibits an anomalous widening at low temperature, and the liquid
density apparently diverges at the stability threshold. Above $\eta_{\rm c}$,
the thermodynamic plane is divided in two regions, differing in the value of
the {\em average} waiting time for collapse, being finite and small on one side
of the boundary line, while large or even infinite in the other region. Upon
adding a small hard core to the DGM potential, stability is fully recovered and
the boundary line is converted to the spinodal line of a transition between
fluid phases. We argue that the destabilization of a colloidal dispersion, as
induced by the addition of salt or other flocculant, finds a suggestive analogy
in the process by which a strengthening of the attraction pushes a
stabilized-DGM system inside the fluid-fluid spinodal region.

single-period portfolio selection problem which use tail risk measures such as
conditional value-at-risk. Tail risk measures are useful for quantifying
potential losses in worst cases. However, for scenario-based problems these are
problematic: because the value of a tail risk measure only depends on a small
subset of the support of the distribution of asset returns, traditional
scenario based methods, which spread scenarios evenly across the whole support
of the distribution, yield very unstable solutions unless we use a very large
number of scenarios. The proposed approach works by prioritizing the
construction of scenarios in the areas of a probability distribution which
correspond to the tail losses of feasible portfolios.
  The proposed approach can be applied to difficult instances of the portfolio
selection problem characterized by high-dimensions, non-elliptical
distributions of asset returns, and the presence of integer variables. It is
also observed that the methodology works better as the feasible set of
portfolios becomes more constrained. Based on this fact, a heuristic algorithm
based on the sample average approximation method is proposed. This algorithm
works by adding artificial constraints to the problem which are gradually
tightened, allowing one to telescope onto high quality solutions.

by various ultrafast spectroscopic techniques, the fastest processes being in
the sub-100 fs range. At the same time much slower dynamics have been observed
in individual complexes by single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy (SMS). In
this work we employ a pump-probe type SMS technique to observe the ultrafast
energy relaxation in single light-harvesting complexes LH2 of purple bacteria.
After excitation at 800 nm, the measured relaxation time distribution of
multiple complexes has a peak at 95 fs and is asymmetric, with a tail at slower
relaxation times. When tuning the excitation wavelength, the distribution
changes in both its shape and position. The observed behaviour agrees with what
is to be expected from the LH2 excited states structure. As we show by a
Redfield theory calculation of the relaxation times, the distribution shape
corresponds to the expected effect of Gaussian disorder of the pigment
transition energies. By repeatedly measuring few individual complexes for
minutes, we find that complexes sample the relaxation time distribution on a
timescale of seconds. Furthermore, by comparing the distribution from three
long-lived complexes with the whole ensemble, we demonstrate that the ensemble
can be considered ergodic. Our findings thus agree with the commonly used
notion of an ensemble of identical LH2 complexes experiencing slow random

remarkably increased superconducting transition temperature (Tc) for the FeSe
single crystals under pressures up to 2.43 GPa, where the Tc is increased by ~8
K/GPa. The critical current density corresponding to the free flux flow is
monotonically enhanced by pressure which is due to the increase in Tc, whereas
the depinning critical current density at which the vortex starts to move is
more influenced by the pressure-induced magnetic state compared to the increase
of Tc. Unlike other high-Tc superconductors, FeSe is not magnetic, but
superconducting at ambient pressure. Above a critical pressure where magnetic
state is induced and coexists with superconductivity, the depinning Jc abruptly
increases even though the increase of the zero-resistivity Tc is negligible,
directly indicating that the flux pinning property compared to the Tc
enhancement is a more crucial factor for an achievement of a large Jc. In
addition, the sharp increase in Jc in the coexisting superconducting phase of
FeSe demonstrates that vortices can be effectively trapped by the competing
antiferromagnetic order, even though its antagonistic nature against
superconductivity is well documented. These results provide new guidance toward
technological applications of high-temperature superconductors.

unifies the properties of these heavy-quark systems with those of light-quark
bound-states, including QCD's Goldstone modes. Analysing the evolution of
$^1S_0$ and $^3S_1$ PDAs with current-quark mass, $\hat m_q$, increasing away
from the chiral limit, it is found that in all cases there is a value of $\hat
m_q$ for which the PDA matches the asymptotic form appropriate to QCD's
conformal limit and hence is insensitive to changes in renormalisation scale,
$\zeta$. This mass lies just above that associated with the $s$-quark. At
current-quark masses associated with heavy-quarkonia, on the other hand, the
PDAs are piecewise convex-concave-convex. They are much narrower than the
asymptotic distribution on a large domain of $\zeta$; but nonetheless deviate
noticeably from $\varphi_{Q\bar Q}(x) = \delta(x-1/2)$, which is the result in
the static-quark limit. There are also material differences between $^1S_0$ and
$^3S_1$ PDAs, and between the PDAs for different vector-meson polarisations,
which vanish slowly with increasing $\zeta$. An analysis of moments of the
root-mean-square relative-velocity, $\langle v^{2m}\rangle$, in $^1S_0$ and

accounts for the dominant source of the uncertainty of the Standard Model
estimates. We present the results of an investigation of the hadronic leading
order anomalous magnetic moments of the electron, muon and tau lepton from
first principles in twisted mass lattice QCD. With lattice data for multiple
pion masses in the range $230 \mathrm{~MeV} \lesssim m_{PS} \lesssim 490
\mathrm{~MeV}$, multiple lattice volumes and three lattice spacings we perform
the extrapolation to the continuum and to the physical pion mass and check for
all systematic uncertainties in the lattice calculation. As a result we
calculate $a_{l}^\mathrm{hlo}$ for the three Standard Model leptons with
controlled statistical and systematic error in agreement with phenomenological
determinations using dispersion relations and experimental data. In addition,
we also give a first estimate of the hadronic leading order anomalous magnetic
moments from simulations directly at the physical value of the pion mass.

While
parametric models have proven effective for this task, they cannot easily
incorporate new training data. By contrast, nonparametric approaches, which
bypass any learning phase and directly transfer the labels from the training
data to the query images, can readily exploit new labeled samples as they
become available. Unfortunately, because of the computational cost of their
label transfer procedures, state-of-the-art nonparametric methods typically
filter out most training images to only keep a few relevant ones to label the
query. As such, these methods throw away many images that still contain
valuable information and generally obtain an unbalanced set of labeled samples.
In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric approach to scene parsing that
follows a sample-and-filter strategy. More specifically, we propose to sample
labeled superpixels according to an image similarity score, which allows us to
obtain a balanced set of samples. We then formulate label transfer as an
efficient filtering procedure, which lets us exploit more labeled samples than
existing techniques. Our experiments evidence the benefits of our approach over
state-of-the-art nonparametric methods on two benchmark datasets.

calibrated across the visible and near-IR images. We use V- and J-band filters

ordinary chondrite-like bodies is most prominent at these wavelengths and can
reach ~25%. To test our method, we observed 3 asteroids with Cerro Tololo's 1.3

that no landslides occurred within the timescale of space weathering, or that
Landslides occurred but the exposed patches are too small for the measurements'

the Moore-Penrose inverse to the symmetric tensor on Lorentz manifolds, we get

The broadband X-ray continuum of PKS 0558- 504 consists of a soft X-ray excess
emission below 2 keV that is well described by a blackbody (kTe ~ 0.13 keV) and
high energy emission that is well described by a thermal Comptonisation

corona) or kTe ~ 90 keV, {\tau} ~ 0.5 (slab corona). The Comptonising corona in
PKS 0558-504 is likely hotter than in radio-quiet Seyferts such as IC 4329A and
Swift J2127.4+5654. The observed soft X-ray excess can be modelled as blurred
reflection from an ionised accretion disk or optically thick thermal
Comptonisation in a low temperature plasma. Both the soft X-ray excess emission
when interpreted as the blurred reflection and the optical/UV to soft X-ray
emission interpreted as intrinsic disk Comptonised emission implies spinning (a

for the engineers and scientists. From the previous studies, there are several
two-phase flow patterns in horizontal pipe. One of them is stratified flow
pattern, which is characterized by the liquid flowing along the bottom of the
pipe and the gas moving above it cocurrently. Another flow patterns are slug
and plug flow patterns. This kind of flow triggers the damage in pipelines,
such as corrosion, abrasion, and blasting pipe. Therefore, slug and plug flow
patterns are undesirable in pipelines, and the flow is maintained at the
stratified flow condition for safety reason. In this paper, the
analytical-based study on the experiment of the stratified flow pattern in a 26
mm i.d. horizontal pipe is presented. The experiment is performed to develop a
high quality database of the stratified two-phase flow pattern. The
experimental data were obtained from the visualization data by using a high

technique. Analytical method of two-fluid model was used to study the
interfacial behavior of the flow. The aim of this study is to validate the
previous correlations which are proposed by other researchers. The results show
that there are still many significant differences among each other. Hence,
better correlation should be proposed in the future. The discussion on the

Metropolis--Hastings scheme which allows us to sample asymptotically from a
target probability density $\pi$, when we are only able to estimate an
unnormalized version of $\pi$ pointwise unbiasedly. It has found numerous
applications in Bayesian statistics as there are many scenarios where the
likelihood function is intractable but can be estimated unbiasedly using Monte
Carlo samples. Using many samples will typically result in averages computed
under this chain with lower asymptotic variances than the corresponding
averages that use fewer samples. For a fixed computing time, it has been shown
in several recent contributions that an efficient implementation of the
pseudo-marginal method requires the variance of the log-likelihood ratio
estimator appearing in the acceptance probability of the algorithm to be of
order 1, which in turn usually requires scaling the number $N$ of Monte Carlo
samples linearly with the number $T$ of data points. We propose a modification
of the pseudo-marginal algorithm, termed the correlated pseudo-marginal
algorithm, which is based on a novel log-likelihood ratio estimator computed
using the difference of two positively correlated log-likelihood estimators. We
show that the parameters of this scheme can be selected such that the variance
of this estimator is order $1$ as $N,T\rightarrow\infty$ whenever
$N/T\rightarrow 0$. By combining these results with the Bernstein-von Mises
theorem, we provide an analysis of the performance of the correlated
pseudo-marginal algorithm in the large $T$ regime. In our numerical examples,
the efficiency of computations is increased relative to the standard
pseudo-marginal algorithm by more than 20 fold for values of $T$ of a few
hundreds to more than 100 fold for values of $T$ of around 10,000-20,000.

tori and we propose a novel torus-PCA method with important properties that can
be generally applied. There are two existing general methods: tangent space PCA
and geodesic PCA. However, unlike tangent space PCA, our torus-PCA honors the
cyclic topology of the data space whereas, unlike geodesic PCA, our torus-PCA
produces a variety of non-winding, non-dense descriptors. This is achieved by
deforming tori into spheres and then using a variant of the recently developed
principle nested spheres analysis. This PCA analysis involves a step of small
sphere fitting and we provide an improved test to avoid overfitting. However,
deforming tori into spheres creates singularities. We introduce a data-adaptive
pre-clustering technique to keep the singularities away from the data. For the
frequently encountered case that the residual variance around the PCA main
component is small, we use a post-mode hunting technique for more fine-grained
clustering. Thus in general, there are three successive interrelated key steps
of torus-PCA in practice: pre-clustering, deformation, and post-mode hunting.
We illustrate our method with two recently studied RNA structure (tori) data
sets: one is a small RNA data set which is established as the benchmark for PCA
and we validate our method through this data. Another is a large RNA data set
(containing the small RNA data set) for which we show that our method provides
interpretable principal components as well as giving further insight into its
structure.

homologs are an essential part of the genetic toolkit in Drosophila

chromosomes has not been characterized at the molecular level, and the degree
of sequence variation among copies of any given balancer chromosome is unknown.
To map inversion breakpoints and study potential sequence diversity in the
descendants of a structurally identical balancer chromosome, we sequenced a
panel of laboratory stocks containing the most widely used X-chromosome
balancer, First Multiple 7 (FM7). We mapped the locations of FM7 breakpoints to
precise euchromatic coordinates and identified the flanking sequence of
breakpoints in heterochromatic regions. Analysis of SNP variation revealed
megabase-scale blocks of sequence divergence among currently used FM7 stocks.
We present evidence that this divergence arose by rare double crossover events
that replaced a female-sterile allele of the singed gene (sn[X2]) on FM7c with
wild type sequence from balanced chromosomes, and propose that many FM7c
chromosomes in the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center have lost sn[X2] by this
mechanism. Finally, we characterize the original allele of the Bar gene (B[1])
that is carried on FM7 and validate the hypothesis that the origin and
subsequent reversion of the B1 duplication is mediated by unequal exchange. Our
results reject a simple non-recombining, clonal mode for the laboratory
evolution of balancer chromosomes and have implications for how balancer
chromosomes should be used in the design and interpretation of genetic
experiments in Drosophila.

arrangements of bacterial colonies, microbial suspensions and tissues to the
coherent macro-scale dynamics in schools of fish and flocks of birds. Yet, the
generic mathematical principles that govern the emergence of structure in such

whether, well-established theoretical concepts describing universal
thermostatistics of equilibrium systems can capture and classify ordered states

Through microfluidic experiments and mathematical modelling, we demonstrate
that lattices of hydrodynamically coupled bacterial vortices can spontaneously
organize into distinct phases of ferro- and antiferromagnetic order. The
preferred phase can be controlled by tuning the vortex coupling through changes
of the inter-cavity gap widths. The emergence of opposing order regimes is
tightly linked to the existence of geometry-induced edge currents, reminiscent

existing register designs, concurrent writes are resolved either by the

arbitrary updates to be lost. In this work, we identify a register construction

propose a simple conflict resolution template based on an

We characterise here a sample of 430 massive clumps from the ATLASGAL survey,

census of molecular tracers of their evolution we performed an unbiased
spectral line survey covering the 3-mm atmospheric window between 84-117 GHz
with the IRAM 30m. A smaller sample of 128 clumps has been observed in the SiO
(5-4) transition with the APEX telescope to complement the SiO (2-1) line and
probe the excitation conditions of the emitting gas, which is the main focus of
the current study. We report a high detection rate of >75% of the SiO (2-1)
line and a >90% detection rate from the dedicated follow-ups in the (5-4)
transition. The SiO (2-1) line with broad line profiles and high detection
rates, is a powerful probe of star formation activity, while the ubiquitous
detection of SiO in all evolutionary stages suggests a continuous star
formation process in massive clumps. We find a large fraction of infrared-quiet
clumps to exhibit SiO emission, the majority of them only showing a
low-velocity component (FWHM~5-6 km/s) centred at the rest velocity of the
clump. In the current picture, where this is attributed to low-velocity shocks
from cloud-cloud collisions, this can be used to pinpoint the youngest, thus,
likely prestellar massive structures. Based on the line ratio of the (5-4) to
the (2-1) line, our study reveals a trend of changing excitation conditions
that lead to brighter emission in the (5-4) line towards more evolved sources.
Our analysis delivers a more robust estimate of SiO column density and
abundance than previous studies and questions the decrease of jet activity in
massive clumps as a function of age.

der Pol (vdP) oscillators via a resistance-capacitance (RC) network comprising
a Ag-TiOx-Al memristive device. The coupling was mediated by connecting the
gate terminals of two programmable unijunction transistors (PUTs) through the
network. In the high resistance state (HRS) the memresistance was in the order
of MOhm leading to two independent selfsustained oscillators characterized by
the different frequencies f1 and f2 and no phase relation between the
oscillations. After a few cycles and in dependency of the mediated pulse
amplitude the memristive device switched to the low resistance state (LRS) and
a frequency adaptation and phase locking was observed. The experimental results
are underlined by theoretically considering a system of two coupled vdP
equations. The presented neuromorphic circuitry conveys two essentials
principle of interacting neuronal ensembles: synchronization and memory. The
experiment may path the way to larger neuromorphic networks in which the
coupling parameters can vary in time and strength and are realized by
memristive devices.

vertex as $H$ such that for each hyperedge of $H$ it holds that its vertices
induce a connected subgraph of $G$. The NP-hard problem of finding a planar
support has applications in hypergraph drawing and network design. Previous
algorithms for the problem assume that twins -- pairs of vertices that are in
precisely the same hyperedges -- can safely be removed from the input
hypergraph. We prove that this assumption is generally wrong, yet that the
number of twins necessary for a hypergraph to have a planar support only
depends on its number of hyperedges. We give an explicit upper bound on the
number of twins necessary for a hypergraph with $m$ hyperedges to have an
$r$-outerplanar support, which depends only on $r$ and $m$. Since all
additional twins can be safely removed, we obtain a linear-time algorithm for
computing $r$-outerplanar supports for hypergraphs with $m$ hyperedges if $m$
and $r$ are constant; in other words, the problem is fixed-parameter
linear-time solvable with respect to the parameters $m$ and $r$.

straight corridor with multiple attractions. The impulse stop is simulated by
the switching behavior model, a function of the social influence strength and
the number of attendees near the attraction. When the pedestrian influx is low,
one can observe a stable flow where attendees make a complete stop at an
attraction and then leave the attraction after a certain amount of time. When
the pedestrian influx is high, an unstable flow is observed for strong social
influence. In the unstable flow, attendees near the attraction are crowded out
from the clusters by others due to the interpersonal repulsion. The expelled
pedestrians impede the pedestrian traffic between the left and right boundaries
of the corridor. These collective patterns of pedestrian flow are summarized in
a schematic phase diagram.

Hamiltonians and unstable states. Our derivation is a quite minimal one as it
requires only the time independent evolution of scalar products, invariance
under complex Lorentz transformations, and a non-standard but nonetheless
perfectly legitimate interpretation of charge conjugation as an anti-linear
operator. The first of these requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be
Hermitian. Rather, it forces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in
complex conjugate pairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be
conjugates of each other, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an anti-linear
symmetry. The latter two requirements then force this anti-linear symmetry to
be $CPT$, while forcing the Hamiltonian to be real rather than Hermitian. Our
work justifies the use of the $CPT$ theorem in establishing the equality of the
lifetimes of unstable particles that are charge conjugates of each other. We
show that the Euclidean time path integrals of a $CPT$ symmetric theory must
always be real. In the quantum-mechanical limit the key results of the $PT$
symmetry program of Bender and collaborators are recovered, with the
$C$-operator of the $PT$ symmetry program being identified with the linear
component of the charge conjugation operator.

  Insurance Data","17 pages, 6 tables",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generalized linear models (GLMs) using a regression procedure to fit
relationships between predictor and target variables are widely used in
automobile insurance data. Here, in the process of ratemaking and in order to
compute the premiums to be charged to the policy--holders it is crucial to
detect the relevant variables which affect to the value of the premium since in
this case the insurer could eventually fix more precisely the premiums. We
propose here a methodology with a different perspective. Instead of the
exponential family we pay attention to the Power Series Distributions and
develop a Bayesian methodology using sampling--based methods in order to detect
relevant variables in automobile insurance data set. This model, as the GLMs,
allows to incorporate the presence of an excessive number of zero counts and
overdispersion phenomena (variance larger than the mean). Following this
spirit, in this paper we present a novel and flexible zero--inflated Bayesian
regression model. This model includes other familiar models such as the
zero--inflated Poisson and zero--inflated geometric models, as special cases. A
Bayesian estimation method is developed as an alternative to traditionally used
maximum likelihood based methods to analyze such data. For a real data
collected from 2004 to 2005 in an Australian insurance company an example is
provided by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method which is developed in WinBUGS
package. The results show that the new Bayesian method performs the previous
models.
