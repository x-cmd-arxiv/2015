A $\textit{sumset}$ is formed by adding these two codewords entry-wise as
integer vectors and a sumset is called $\textit{typical}$, if the sum falls
inside this set with high probability. We ask the question: how large is the
typical sumset for most codes? In this paper we characterize the asymptotic
size of such typical sumset. We show that when the rate $R$ of the linear code
is below a certain threshold $D$, the typical sumset size is roughly $|\mathcal
C|^2=2^{2nR}$ for most codes while when $R$ is above this threshold, most codes
have a typical sumset whose size is roughly $|\mathcal C|\cdot
2^{nD}=2^{n(R+D)}$ due to the linear structure of the codes. The threshold $D$
depends solely on the alphabet size $q$ and takes value in $[1/2, \log
\sqrt{e})$. More generally, we completely characterize the asymptotic size of
typical sumsets of two nested linear codes $\mathcal C_1, \mathcal C_2$ with
different rates. As an application of the result, we study the communication

the ""quartet current"". We calculate the zero-frequency current noise
cross-correlations and answer the question of whether this current is noisy
(like a normal current in response to a voltage drop) or noiseless (like an
equilibrium supercurrent in response to a phase drop). A quantum dot with a
level at energy $\epsilon_0$ is connected to three superconductors $S_a$, $S_b$
and $S_c$ with gap $\Delta$, biased at $V_a=V$, $V_b=-V$ and $V_c=0$, and with
intermediate contact transparencies. At zero temperature, nonlocal quartets (in
the sense of four-fermion correlations) are noiseless at subgap voltage in the
nonresonant dot regime $\epsilon_0/\Delta\gg 1$, which is demonstrated with a
semi-analytical perturbative expansion of the cross-correlations. Noise reveals
the absence of granularity of the superflow splitting from $S_c$ towards
$(S_a,S_b)$ in the nonresonant dot regime, in spite of finite voltage. In the
resonant dot regime $\epsilon_0/\Delta< 1$, cross-correlations measured in the
$(V_a,V_b)$ plane should reveal an ""anomaly"" in the vicinity of the quartet
line $V_a+V_b=0$, related to an additional contribution to the noise,
manifesting the phase sensitivity of cross-correlations under the appearance of
a three-body phase variable. Phase-dependent effective Fano factors $F_\varphi$
are introduced, defined as the ratio between the amplitudes of phase
modulations of the noise and the currents. At low bias, the Fano factors
$F_\varphi$ are of order unity in the resonant dot regime $\epsilon_0/\Delta<
1$, and they are vanishingly small in the nonresonant dot regime
$\epsilon_0/\Delta\gg 1$.

theory in the number of nonlocal Green's functions"", is presented that can be
operational on a standard computer and demonstrates compatibility with results
existing in the literature. In a linear structure made of two neighboring
interfaces (with intermediate transparency) connected by a central
superconductor, tunneling through each of the interfaces separately is taken
into account to all orders. On the contrary, nonlocal processes connecting the
two interfaces are accounted for at the lowest relevant order. This yields
logarithmically divergent contributions at the gap edges, which are sufficient
as a semi-quantitative description. The method is able to describe the current
in the full two-dimensional voltage range, including commensurate as well as
incommensurate values. The results found for the multipair (for instance
quartet) current-phase characteristics as well as the MAR thresholds are
compatible with previous results. At intermediate transparency, the multipair
critical current is much larger than the background MAR current, which supports
an experimental observation of the quartet and multipair resonances. The paper
provides a proof of principle for addressing in the future the interplay

Hierons","Decidability and Complexity for Quiescent Consistency and its Variations",,,,,"cs.LO cs.DC cs.DS cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quiescent consistency is a notion of correctness for a concurrent object that
gives meaning to the object's behaviours in quiescent states, i.e., states in
which none of the object's operations are being executed. Correctness of an
implementation object is defined in terms of a corresponding abstract
specification. This gives rise to two important verification questions:
membership (checking whether a behaviour of the implementation is allowed by
the specification) and correctness (checking whether all behaviours of the
implementation are allowed by the specification). In this paper, we show that
the membership problem for quiescent consistency is NP-complete and that the
correctness problem is decidable, but coNP-hard and in EXPSPACE. For both
problems, we consider restricted versions of quiescent consistency by assuming
an upper limit on the number of events between two quiescent points. Here, we
show that the membership problem is in PTIME, whereas correctness is in PSPACE.
  Quiescent consistency does not guarantee sequential consistency, i.e., it
allows operation calls by the same process to be reordered when mapping to an
abstract specification. Therefore, we also consider quiescent sequential
consistency, which strengthens quiescent consistency with an additional
sequential consistency condition. We show that the unrestricted versions of
membership and correctness are NP-complete and undecidable, respectively. When
by placing a limit on the number of events between two quiescent points,
membership is in PTIME, while correctness is in PSPACE. Finally, we consider a
version of quiescent sequential consistency that places an upper limit on the
number of processes for every run of the implementation, and show that the
membership problem for quiescent sequential consistency with this restriction
is in PTIME.

Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation while the fluctuations of the modulus are smaller

scarcity and rising stream temperatures, is assessed for the contiguous United
States at decadal scales. Regional water scarcity is driven by climate
variability and change, as well as by multi-sector water demand. While a
planning horizon of zero to about thirty years is occasionally prescribed by
stakeholders, the challenges to risk assessment at these scales include the
difficulty in delineating decadal climate trends from intrinsic natural or
multiple model variability. Current generation global climate or earth system
models are not credible at the spatial resolutions of power plants, especially
for surface water quantity and stream temperatures, which further exacerbates
the assessment challenge. Population changes, which are difficult to project,
cannot serve as adequate proxies for changes in the water demand across
sectors. The hypothesis that robust assessments of power production at risk are
possible, despite the uncertainties, has been examined as a proof of concept.
An approach is presented for delineating water scarcity and temperature from
climate models, observations and population storylines, as well as for
assessing power production at risk by examining geospatial correlations of
power plant locations within regions where the usable water supply for energy
production happens to be scarcer and warmer. Our analyses showed that in the
near term, more than 200 counties are likely to be exposed to water scarcity in
the next three decades. Further, we noticed that stream gauges in more than
five counties in the 2030s and ten counties in the 2040s showed a significant
increase in water temperature, which exceeded the power plant effluent
temperature threshold set by the EPA. Power plants in South Carolina,
Louisiana, and Texas are likely to be vulnerable owing to climate-driven water

manifold $(M,\omega)$ over a smooth symplectic manifold $(B,\lambda)$, the
foliation into leaves of the bundle coincides with the symplectic foliation

structure $\Omega_{\varepsilon}=$ $\omega + \varepsilon^{-1}p^*\lambda$ on $M$
for any positive small $\varepsilon$, where $p^*\lambda$ is a lift of 2-form
$\lambda$ on $M$. Given a smooth Hamiltonian $H$ on $M$ one gets a slow-fast

multidimensional washboard ratchet potential Uf for two-dimensional Josephson
junctions array (TDJJA) with an applied magnetic field. The magnetic field is
given in units of the quantum ux per plaquette or frustration of the form f = M
N . The derivation is done under the assumption that the checkerboard pattern
ground state or unit cell of a two-dimensional Josephson junctions array
(TDJJA) is preserved under current bias. The RCSJ with a white noise term
models the dynamics for each junction phase in the array. The multidimensional
potential is the unique expression of the collective effects that emerge from
the array in contrast to the single junction. First step in the procedure is to
write the equation for the phases for the unit cell by considering the
constraints imposed for the gauge invariant phases due to frustration. Secondly
and key idea of the procedure, is to perform a variable transformation from the
original systems of stochastic equations to a system of variables where the
condition for the equality of mixed second partial is forced via the
Poincar\'e's theorem for differentials forms. This leads to a nonlinear matrix
equation (equation (9) in the text), where the new coordinates variables xf are
evaluated and where the potential exist. The transform matrix also permits the
correct transformation of the original white noise terms of each junction to
the intensities in the xf variables. The commensurate symmetries of the ground
state pinned vortex lattice, leads to discrete symmetries to the part of the
washboard potential that does not contain a tilt due to the external bias
current(equation(10) in the text). In this work we apply the procedure for the
important cases f = 1 2 ; 1 3 .

new structures, almost all of them chiral. Beyond $D\approx2.85\sigma$, most of
the structures consist of an outer shell and an inner core that compete for
being close packed. In some cases, the shell adopts its own maximum density
configuration, and the stacking of core spheres within it is quasiperiodic. In
other cases, an interplay between the two components is observed, which may
result in simple periodic structures. In yet other cases, the very distinction
between core and shell vanishes, resulting in more exotic packing geometries,

the role of substrate on reflective properties of the nanoparticles. We develop
a simple semi-analytical model that describes interference of separate

setting the {\pi}-phase difference of the electric and magnetic dipole moments
induced in nanoparticles, one can obtain a suppression of reflection from the
substrate coated with metasurface. We perform numerical simulations of sphere
and disk nanoparticle arrays for different permittivities of the substrate. We
find full agreement with the semi-analytical results, which means that the
uncoupled-element model adequately describes nanostructure reflective
properties, despite the effects of induced bi-anisotropy. The model explains
the features of the reflectance spectrum, such as a number of dips and their
spectral positions, and show why it may not coincide with the spectral
positions of Mie resonances of the single nanoparticles forming the system. We
also address practical aspects of the antireflective device engineering: we
show that the uncoupled-element model is applicable to the structures on top of
silicon substrates, including lithographically defined nanopillars. The
reflectance suppression from nanoparticle array on top of the silicon substrate
can be achieved in a broad spectral range with disordered nanoparticle array

receiving-points, which corresponds to a box-like FCIR. In this paper, we
characterize the FCIR for {\em uplink} transmissions in cellular CRNs and for
direct transmissions in ad-hoc CRNs. We show that the FCIR is in fact a
polyhedron (i.e., the maximum feasible cognitive interference threshold for
each primary receiving-point is not a constant, and it depends on that for the
other primary receiving-points). Therefore, in practical interference
management algorithms, it is not proper to consider a constant and independent
ITL value for each of the primary receiving-points. This finding would
significantly affect the design of practical interference management schemes
for CRNs. To demonstrate this, based on the characterized FCIR, we propose two
power control algorithms to find the maximum number of admitted SUs and the
maximum aggregate throughput of the SUs in infeasible and feasible CRNs,
respectively. For two distinct objectives, our proposed interference management
schemes outperform the existing ones.

  Control in Prioritized Multi-tier Cellular Networks","IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, to appear",,,,"cs.NI cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Next generation cellular networks will consist of multiple tiers of cells and
users associated with different network tiers may have different priorities
(e.g., macrocell-picocell-femtocell networks with macro tier prioritized over
pico tier, which is again prioritized over femto tier). Designing efficient
joint power and admission control (JPAC) algorithms for such networks under a
co-channel deployment (i.e., underlay) scenario is of significant importance.
Feasibility checking of a given target signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio
(SINR) vector is generally the most significant contributor to the complexity
of JPAC algorithms in single/multi-tier underlay cellular networks. This is
generally accomplished through iterative strategies whose complexity is either
unpredictable or of O(M^3), when the well-known relationship between the SINR
vector and the power vector is used, where $M$ is the number of users/links. In
this paper, we derive a novel relationship between a given SINR vector and its
corresponding uplink/downlink power vector based on which the feasibility
checking can be performed with a complexity of O(B^3+M B), where B is the
number of base stations. This is significantly less compared to O(M^3) in many
cellular wireless networks since the number of base stations is generally much
lower than the number of users/links in such networks. The developed novel
relationship between the SINR and power vector not only substantially reduces
the complexity of designing JPAC algorithms, but also provides insights into
developing efficient but low-complexity power update strategies for prioritized
multi-tier cellular networks. We propose two such algorithms and through
simulations, we show that our proposed algorithms outperform the existing ones
in prioritized cellular networks.

by various sources of error inherent to the SIFT implementation affecting the
stability and accuracy of keypoint detection. The density of the sampling of
the Gaussian scale-space and the level of blur in the input image are two of
these sources. This article presents a numerical analysis of their impact on
the extracted keypoints stability. Such an analysis has both methodological and
practical implications, on how to compare feature detectors and on how to
improve SIFT. We show that even with a significantly oversampled scale-space
numerical errors prevent from achieving perfect stability. Usual strategies to
filter out unstable detections are shown to be inefficient. We also prove that
the effect of the error in the assumption on the initial blur is asymmetric and
that the method is strongly degraded in presence of aliasing or without a

status of star-forming galaxies with ambiguous morphologies, and constrain the

measuring the importance of interactions or galaxy merger rates requires
knowledge of the systematics in kinematic diagnostics and the visible time with
merger indicators. We analyze the dynamics of star-forming gas in a set of
binary merger hydrodynamic simulations with stellar mass ratios of 1:1 and 1:4.
We find that the evolution of kinematic asymmetries traced by star-forming gas
mirrors morphological asymmetries derived from mock optical images, in which
both merger indicators show the largest deviation from isolated disks during
strong interaction phases. Based on a series of simulations with various
initial disk orientations, orbital parameters, gas fractions, and mass ratios,
we find that the merger signatures are visible for ~0.2-0.4 Gyr with kinematic
merger indicators but can be approximately twice as long for equal-mass mergers
of massive gas-rich disk galaxies designed to be analogs of z~2-3 submillimeter
galaxies. Merger signatures are most apparent after the second passage and
before the black holes coalescence, but in some cases they persist up to
several hundred Myr after coalescence. About 20-60% of the simulated galaxies
are not identified as mergers during the strong interaction phase, implying
that galaxies undergoing violent merging process do not necessarily exhibit
highly asymmetric kinematics in their star-forming gas. The lack of
identifiable merger signatures in this population can lead to an
underestimation of merger abundances in star-forming galaxies, and including
them in samples of star-forming disks may bias the measurements of disk
properties such as intrinsic velocity dispersion.

distribution, projected ellipticity, and mean metallicity of the red
(metal-richer) clusters match the halo light extremely well for R > 15 kpc,
both of them varying as \sigma_{MRGC} ~ \sigma_{light} ~ R^-1.8. By comparison,
the blue (metal-poor) GC component has a much shallower falloff \sigma_{MPGC} ~
R^-1.0 and a more nearly spherical distribution. This strong difference in
their density distributions produces a net metallicity gradient in the GCS as a
whole that is primarily generated by the population gradient. With NGC 6166 we
appear to be penetrating into a regime of high enough galaxy mass and rich
enough environment that the bimodal two-phase description of GC formation is no
longer as clear or effective as it has been in smaller galaxies.

which it cannot grow through luminous accretion of gas, and so cannot appear as
a quasar or active galactic nucleus. The limit is Mmax \simeq 5x10^{10}M_sun
for typical parameters, but can reach Mmax \simeq 2.7x10^{11}M_sun in extreme
cases (e.g. maximal prograde spin). The largest black hole masses so far found

erg/s corresponding to Mmax is remarkably close to the largest AGN bolometric
luminosity so far observed. The mass and luminosity limits both rely on a
reasonable but currently untestable hypothesis about AGN disc formation, so
future observations of extreme SMBH masses can therefore probe fundamental disc
physics. Black holes can in principle grow their masses above Mmax by
non-luminous means such as mergers with other holes, but cannot become luminous
accretors again. They might nevertheless be detectable in other ways, for
example through gravitational lensing. I show further that black holes with
masses ~ Mmax can probably grow above the values specified by the black-hole --
host-galaxy scaling relations, in agreement with observation.

reionization of the universe. Even as gains are made in mapping the galaxy UV
luminosity density to z>6, significant uncertainties remain regarding the
conversion to the implied ionizing emissivity. The relevant unknowns are the
Lyman-continuum (LyC) photon production efficiency xi_{ion} and the escape
fraction f_{esc}. As we show here, the first of these unknowns is directly
measureable in z=4-5 galaxies, based on the impact the Halpha line has on the
observed IRAC fluxes. By computing a LyC photon production rate from the
implied Halpha luminosities for a broad selection of z=4-5 galaxies and
comparing this against the dust-corrected UV-continuum luminosities, we provide
the first-ever direct estimates of the LyC photon production efficiency
xi_{ion} for the z>~4 galaxy population. We find log_{10} xi_{ion}/[Hz/ergs] to
have a mean value of 25.27_{-0.03}^{+0.03} and 25.34_{-0.02}^{+0.02} for sub-L*
z=4-5 galaxies adopting Calzetti and SMC dust laws, respectively. Reassuringly,
both values are consistent with standardly assumed xi_{ion}'s in reionization
models, with a slight preference for higher xi_{ion}'s (by ~0.1 dex) adopting
the SMC dust law. A modest ~0.03-dex increase in these estimates would result
if the escape fraction for ionizing photons is non-zero and galaxies dominate
the ionizing emissivity at z~4.4. High values of xi_{ion} (~25.5-25.8 dex) are
derived for the bluest galaxies (beta<-2.3) in our samples, independent of dust
law and consistent with results for a z=7.045 galaxy. Such elevated values of
xi_{ion} would have important consequences, indicating that f_{esc} cannot be
in excess of 13% unless the galaxy UV luminosity function does not extend down
to -13 mag or the clumping factor is greater than 3. A low escape fraction
would fit well with the low rate of LyC leakage observed at z~3.

$AdS$ behaviour. For simplicity we focus on the case of a dipolar electrostatic

full backreaction of the electric field on the $AdS$ geometry; (ii) a polarised
neutral black hole that is deformed by the electric field, accumulating
opposite charges in each hemisphere. For both geometries we study boundary data
such as the charge density and the stress tensor. For the black hole we also
study the horizon charge density and area, and further verify a Smarr formula.
Then we consider this system at finite temperature and compute the Gibbs free
energy for both $AdS$ soliton and black hole phases. The corresponding phase
diagram generalizes the Hawking-Page phase transition. The $AdS$ soliton
dominates the low temperature phase and the black hole the high temperature
phase, with a critical temperature that decreases as the external electric

reasoning capabilities) complex knowledge structures that can be at least
plausibly comparable, both in terms of size and of typology of the encoded
information, to the knowledge that humans process daily for executing everyday
activities. Handling a huge amount of knowledge, and selectively retrieve it
ac- cording to the needs emerging in different situational scenarios, is an
important aspect of human intelligence. For this task, in fact, humans adopt a
wide range of heuristics (Gigerenzer and Todd) due to their bounded rationality
(Simon, 1957). In this perspective, one of the re- quirements that should be
considered for the design, the realization and the evaluation of intelligent
cognitively inspired systems should be represented by their ability of
heuristically identify and retrieve, from the general knowledge stored in their
artificial Long Term Memory (LTM), that one which is synthetically and
contextually relevant. This require- ment, however, is often neglected.
Currently, artificial cognitive systems and architectures are not able, de
facto, to deal with complex knowledge structures that can be even slightly
comparable to the knowledge heuris- tically managed by humans. In this paper I
will argue that this is not only a technological problem but also an
epistemological one and I will briefly sketch a proposal for a possible
solution.

acceleration efficiency of the magnetar sources can be constrained. When we
assume a proton cosmic ray composition and spherical supernovae ejecta, we find
that the IceCube limits almost exclude their significant contribution to the
observed UHE cosmic-ray flux. Furthermore, we consider scenarios where a
fraction of cosmic rays can escape from jet-like structures piercing the

production of UHE cosmic rays and help remove the tension between their EeV
neutrino production and the observational data.

the context of core-collapse supernovae and compact binary mergers. Based on
previous gray leakage schemes, the ASL scheme computes the neutrino cooling
rates by interpolating local production and diffusion rates (relevant in
optically thin and thick regimes, respectively), separately for discretized
values of the neutrino energy. Neutrino trapped components are also modeled,
based on equilibrium and timescale arguments. The better accuracy achieved by
the spectral treatment allows a more reliable computation of neutrino heating
rates in optically thin conditions. The scheme has been calibrated and tested
against Boltzmann transport in the context of Newtonian spherically symmetric
models of core-collapse supernovae. ASL shows a very good qualitative and a
partial quantitative agreement, for key quantities from collapse to a few
hundreds of milliseconds after core bounce. We have proved the adaptability and
flexibility of our ASL scheme coupling it to an axisymmetric Eulerian and to a
three-dimensional SPH code to simulate core-collapse. Therefore, the neutrino
treatment presented here is ideal for large parameter-space explorations,
parametric studies, high-resolution tests, code developments, and long-term
modeling of asymmetric configurations, where more detailed neutrino treatments
are not available or currently computationally too expensive.

visual appearance changes caused by variations of viewpoints, lighting, and
occlusion. Approaches in literature can be categoried into two streams: The
first stream is to develop reliable features against realistic conditions by
combining several visual features in a pre-defined way; the second stream is to
learn a metric from training data to ensure strong inter-class differences and
intra-class similarities. However, seeking an optimal combination of visual
features which is generic yet adaptive to different benchmarks is a unsoved
problem, and metric learning models easily get over-fitted due to the scarcity
of training data in person re-identification. In this paper, we propose two
effective structured learning based approaches which explore the adaptive
effects of visual features in recognizing persons in different benchmark data
sets. Our framework is built on the basis of multiple low-level visual features
with an optimal ensemble of their metrics. We formulate two optimization
algorithms, CMCtriplet and CMCstruct, which directly optimize evaluation
measures commonly used in person re-identification, also known as the
Cumulative Matching Characteristic (CMC) curve.

sensing, data processing, and communication capabilities. Recent technological
advances have opened up possibilities to deploy spatially distributed systems
for signal sampling and reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce a graph
structure for a distributed sampling and reconstruction system by coupling
agents in a spatially distributed system with innovative positions of signals.
A fundamental problem in sampling theory is the robustness of signal
reconstruction in the presence of sampling noises. For a distributed sampling
and reconstruction system, the robustness could be reduced to the stability of
its sensing matrix. In a traditional centralized sampling and reconstruction
system, the stability of the sensing matrix could be verified by its central
processor, but the above procedure is infeasible in a distributed sampling and
reconstruction system as it is decentralized. In this paper, we split a
distributed sampling and reconstruction system into a family of overlapping
smaller subsystems, and we show that the stability of the sensing matrix holds
if and only if its quasi-restrictions to those subsystems have uniform
stability. This new stability criterion could be pivotal for the design of a
robust distributed sampling and reconstruction system against supplement,
replacement and impairment of agents, as we only need to check the uniform
stability of affected subsystems. In this paper, we also propose an
exponentially convergent distributed algorithm for signal reconstruction, that
provides a suboptimal approximation to the original signal in the presence of
bounded sampling noises.

The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has been used to realize
small-scale quantum information processing (QIP) and quantum sensing under
ambient conditions. A major barrier in the development of large-scale QIP in
diamond is the connection of NV spin registers by a quantum bus at room
temperature. Given that diamond is expected to be an ideal spin transport
material, the coherent transport of spin directly between the spin registers
offers a potential solution. Yet, there has been no demonstration of spin
transport in diamond due to difficulties in achieving spin injection and
detection via conventional methods. Here, we exploit detailed knowledge of the
paramagnetic defects in diamond to identify novel mechanisms to achieve spin
injection, transport and detection in diamond at room temperature. Having
identified these mechanisms, we explore how they may be combined to realise an

leading to quark matter. The immense densities reached in the inner core of

To investigate a crossover transition between two phenomenological models which
epitomise QCD in two different regimes, while incorporating the influence of
quark degrees of freedom in both. Method: We use the Hartree-Fock quark-meson
coupling model and the proper time regularised three flavour NJL model to
describe hadronic and quark matter, respectively. Hybrid equations of state are
obtained by interpolating the energy density as a function of total baryonic
density and calculating the pressure. Results: Equations of state for hadronic,
quark and hybrid matter and the resulting mass versus radius curves for hybrid
stars are shown, as well as other relevant physical quantities such as species
fractions and the speed of sound in matter. Conclusions: The observations of
massive neutron stars can certainly be explained within such a construction.
However, the so-called thermodynamic correction arising from an interpolation
method can have a considerable impact on the equation of state. The
interpolation dependency of and physical meaning behind such corrections
require further study.

inertia, the tidal Love number (deformability) and the spin-induced quadrupole
moment of compact stars are, to high accuracy, interconnected in a universal
way disregarding the wide variety of equations of state (EOSs) of dense matter,
has attracted much interest recently. However, the physical origin of these
relations is still a debatable issue. In the present paper, we focus on the
I-Love relation for self-bound stars (SBSs) such as incompressible stars and
quark stars. We formulate perturbative expansions for the moment of inertia,
the tidal Love number (deformability) and the I-Love relation of SBSs. By
comparing the respective I-Love relations of incompressible stars and a
specific kind of SBSs, we show analytically that the I-Love relation is, to
relevant leading orders in stellar compactness, stationary with respect to
changes in the EOS about the incompressible limit. Hence, the universality of
the I-Love relation is indeed attributable to the proximity of compact stars to
incompressible stars, and the stationarity of the relation as unveiled here. We
also discover that the moment of inertia and the tidal deformability of a SBS
with finite compressibility are, to leading order in compactness, equal to
their counterparts of an incompressible star with an adjusted compactness, thus
leading to a novel explanation for the I-Love universal relation.

formation using the observational data of recent molecular outflow surveys
toward nearby cluster-forming clumps. We found that for almost all clumps, the
outflow momentum injection rate is significantly larger than the turbulence
dissipation rate. Therefore, the outflow feedback is likely to maintain
supersonic turbulence in the clumps. For less massive clumps such as B59,
L1551, and L1641N, the outflow kinetic energy is comparable to the clump
gravitational energy. In such clumps, the outflow feedback probably affects
significantly the clump dynamics. On the other hand, for clumps with masses
larger than about 200 M$_\odot$, the outflow kinetic energy is significantly
smaller than the clump gravitational energy. Since the majority of stars form
in such clumps, we conclude that outflow feedback cannot destroy the whole
parent clump. These characteristics of the outflow feedback support the
scenario of slow star formation.

containing $A$ as a subspace and $V$ be a complement of $A$ in $E$.The
extending structures problem which asks for the classification of all
left-symmetric (resp. Novikov) algebra structures on $E$ such that $A$ is a
subalgebra of $E$ is studied. In this paper, the definition of the unified
product of left-symmetric (resp. Novikov) algebras is introduced. It is shown
that there exists a left-symmetric (resp. Novikov) algebra structure on $E$
such that $A$ is a subalgebra of $E$ if and only if $E$ is isomorphic to a
unified product of $A$ and $V$. Two cohomological type objects
$\mathcal{H}_A^2(V,A)$ and $\mathcal{H}^2(V,A)$ are constructed to give a
theoretical answer to the extending structures problem. Furthermore, given an
extension $A\subset E$ of left-symmetric (resp. Novikov) algebras, another
cohomological type object is constructed to classify all complements of $A$ in
$E$. Several special examples are provided in details.

model disease spread and other processes. Despite the widespread usage of this
ordinary differential equation (ODE) based model which represents the
mean-field approximation of the underlying stochastic SIR process on contact
networks, only few rigorous approaches exist and these use complex semigroup
and martingale techniques to prove that the expected fraction of the
susceptible and infected nodes of the stochastic SIR process on a complete
graph converges as the number of nodes increases to the solution of the
mean-field ODE model. Extending the elementary proof of convergence for the SIS
process introduced by Armbruster and Beck (2016) to the SIR process, we show
convergence using only a system of three ODEs, simple probabilistic
inequalities, and basic ODE theory. Our approach can also be generalized to
many other types of compartmental models (e.g.,
susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS)) which are linear ODEs with
the addition of quadratic terms for the number of new infections similar to the
SI term in the SIR model.

algorithm for compressive sensing, which enjoys superior probability of success
over other well-known recovery algorithms under conditions of correlated

version of OLS which selects multiple candidates per iteration by generalizing
the greedy selection principle used in OLS and enjoys faster convergence than
OLS. In this paper, we present a refined version of the mOLS algorithm where at
each step of the iteration, we first preselect a submatrix of the measurement
matrix suitably and then apply the mOLS computations to the chosen submatrix.
Since mOLS now works only on a submatrix and not on the overall matrix,
computations reduce drastically. Convergence of the algorithm, however,
requires ensuring passage of true candidates through the two stages of
preselection and mOLS based selection successively. This paper presents
convergence conditions for both noisy and noise free signal models. The
proposed algorithm enjoys faster convergence properties similar to mOLS, at a
much reduced computational complexity.

to compute equilibria in games where the payoffs are probability distributions.
Our approach is ""data driven"" in the sense that we assume empirical data
(measurements, simulation, etc.) to be available that can be compiled into
distribution models, which are suitable for efficient decisions about
preferences, and setting up and solving games using these as payoffs. While
preferences among distributions turn out to be quite simple if nonparametric
methods (kernel density estimates) are used, computing Nash-equilibria in games
using such models is discovered as inefficient (if not impossible). In fact, we
give a counterexample in which fictitious play fails to converge for the
(specifically unfortunate) choice of payoff distributions in the game, and
introduce a suitable tail approximation of the payoff densities to tackle the
issue. The overall procedure is essentially a modified version of fictitious
play, and is herein described for standard and multicriteria games, to

assignment of axis-aligned rectangles to vertices such that for every edge
there exists a horizontal or vertical line of sight between the rectangles
assigned to its endpoints. Testing whether a graph has an RVR is known to be
NP-hard. In this paper, we study the problem of finding an RVR under the
assumption that an embedding in the plane of the input graph is fixed and we
are looking for an RVR that reflects this embedding. We show that in this case
the problem can be solved in polynomial time for general embedded graphs and in
linear time for 1-plane graphs (i.e., embedded graphs having at most one
crossing per edge). The linear time algorithm uses a precise list of forbidden
configurations, which extends the set known for straight-line drawings of
1-plane graphs. These forbidden configurations can be tested for in linear
time, and so in linear time we can test whether a 1-plane graph has an RVR and
either compute such a representation or report a negative witness. Finally, we
discuss some extensions of our study to the case when the embedding is not
fixed but the RVR can have at most one crossing per edge.

constructed FA that process terms denoting graphs of bounded clique-width, in

are actually implementable and usable. We detail concrete constructions of

Rashba-like spin winding with a splitting of a few meV and when surface

While magnetism tends to suppress the effects of the relativistic Rashba

spin textures. Furthermore, we observe an atomic specialization phenomenon,
namely, two types of electronic contributions: one is from Ti atoms neighboring
the oxygen vacancies that acquire rather large magnetic moments and mostly
create in-gap states; another comes from the partly polarized t$_{2g}$
itinerant electrons of Ti atoms lying further away from the oxygen vacancy,

and anti-parallel actin filaments, their polymerization and depolymerization,
and, most importantly, the interaction with the motor protein myosin, which
leads to sliding of anti-parallel filaments relative to each other. The model
relies on the assumption that actin filaments are short compared to the length
of the bundle. It is a two-phase model which treats actin filaments of both
orientations separately. It consists of quasi-stationary force balances
determining the local velocities of the filament families and of transport
equations for the filaments. Two types of initial-boundary value problems are
considered, where either the bundle length or the total force on the bundle are
prescribed. In the latter case, the bundle length is determined as a free
boundary. Local in time existence and uniqueness results are proven. For the
problem with given bundle length, a global solution exists for short enough
bundles. For small prescribed force, a formal approximation can be computed
explicitly, and the bundle length tends to a limiting value.

inertia in real time. We consider a central controller and a number of
resources, where each resource is either a load, a generator, or a combination
thereof, like a battery. The controller periodically computes power setpoints
for the resources based on the estimated state of the grid and an overall
objective, and subject to safety constraints. Each resource is augmented with a
resource agent that a) implements the setpoint requests sent by the controller
on the resource, and b) translates device-specific information about the
resource into a device-independent representation and transmits this to the
controller.
  We focus on the resource agents and their impact on the overall system's
behavior. Intuitively, for the system to converge to the objective, the
resource agents should be obedient to the requests from the controller, in the
sense that the actually implemented setpoint should be close to the requested
setpoint, at least on average. This can be important especially when a
controller that performs continuous optimization is used (for the sake of
performance) to control discrete resources (which have a discrete set of
implementable setpoints).
  We formalize obedience by defining the notion of $c$-bounded
accumulated-error. We then demonstrate its usefulness, by presenting
theoretical results (for a simple scenario) and simulation results (for a more
realistic setting) that indicate that, if all resource agents in the system
have bounded accumulated-error, the closed-loop system converges on average to
the objective. Finally, we show how to design resource agents that provably
have bounded accumulated-error for various types of resources, such as
resources with uncertainty (e.g., PV panels) and resources with a discrete set
of implementable setpoints (e.g., on-off heating systems).

proposed to group locally-coupled small cell base stations (SBSs) into clusters
based on location and traffic load. Within each formed cluster, SBSs coordinate
their transmission parameters to minimize a cost function which captures the
tradeoffs between energy efficiency and flow level performance, while
satisfying their users' quality-of-service requirements. Due to the lack of
inter-cluster communications, clusters compete with one another in order to
improve the overall network's energy efficiency. This inter-cluster competition
is formulated as a noncooperative game between clusters that seek to minimize
their respective cost functions. To solve this game, a distributed learning
algorithm is proposed using which clusters autonomously choose their optimal
transmission strategies based on local information. It is shown that the
proposed algorithm converges to a stationary mixed-strategy distribution which
constitutes an epsilon-coarse correlated equilibrium for the studied game.
Simulation results show that the proposed approach yields significant
performance gains reaching up to 36% of reduced energy expenditures and up to
41% of reduced fractional transfer time compared to conventional approaches.

teams from the High-Performance Computing as well as the Embedded domain. This
issue is mostly attacked from an hardware perspective, by devising
architectures that put energy efficiency as a primary target, often at the cost
of processing power. Lately, computing platforms have become more and more
heterogeneous, but the exploitation of these additional capabilities is so
complex from the application developer's perspective that they are left unused
most of the time, resulting therefore in a supplemental waste of energy rather
than in faster processing times.
  In this paper we present a transparent, on-the-fly optimization scheme that
allows a generic application to automatically exploit the available computing
units to partition its computational load. We have called our approach
Heterogeneous Platform Accelerator (HPA). The idea is to use profiling to
automatically select a computing-intensive candidate for acceleration, and then
distribute the computations to the different units by off-loading blocks of
code to them.
  Using an NVIDIA Jetson TK1 board, we demonstrate that not only HPA results in
faster processing speed, but also in a considerable reduction in the total
energy absorbed.

curvaton field. Potentials of appropriate form so that the pertinent action is
invariant under global Weyl-scale symmetry are introduced. Scale invariance is
spontaneously broken upon integration of the equations of motion. After
performing transition to the physical Einstein frame we obtain: (i) For given
value of the curvaton field an effective potential for the scalar field with
two flat regions for the dilaton which allows for a unified description of both
early universe inflation as well as of present dark energy epoch;(iii) In the
phase corresponding to the early universe, the curvaton has a constant mass and
can oscillate decoupled from the dilaton and that can be responsible for both
reheating and perturbations in the theory. In this framework, we obtain some
interesting constraints on different parameters that appear in our model;

from $G$ a tree $(V,E',w')$ that stores all minimum $st$-cut values. Motivated
by this result, we obtain tight bounds for the redundancy factor of several
generalizations of the minimum $st$-cut problem.
  1. Group-Cut: Consider the minimum $(A,B)$-cut, ranging over all subsets
$A,B\subseteq V$ of given sizes $|A|=\alpha$ and $|B|=\beta$. The redundancy
factor is $\Omega_{\alpha,\beta}(|V|)$.

the redundancy factor is much larger than in the first two problems.

Hawking's chronology protection conjecture is unpleasant but can be understood
if one solves the coupled scalar-gauge field equations and the matching
conditions at the core of the string. A new interior numerical solution is
found of a self gravitating spinning cosmic string with a U(1) scalar gauge
field and the matching on the exterior space time is revealed. It is
conjectured that the experience of CTC's close to the core of the string is
exceedingly unlikely. It occurs when the causality breaking boundary, $r_\mu$,
approaches the boundary of the cosmic string, $r_{CS}$. Then the metric
components become singular and the proper time on the core of the string stops
flowing. Further, we expect that the angular momentum $J$ will decrease due to
the emission of gravitational energy triggered by the scalar perturbations.
When a complete loop is taken around the string, the interior time jumps by a
factor $2\pi J$. The proper time it takes to make a complete loop becomes
infinite and will be equal to the period that $g_{\varphi\varphi}$ remains
positive. In this time interval the angular momentum will be reduced to zero by
emission of wave energy. The physical situation of an observer who experience
$r_{\mu}\rightarrow r_{CS}$ is very unpleasant: the energy-momentum tensor

of the non-condensate density at finite temperatures with the modification of
trapping potential. In particular, the condensate and non-condensate density
distributions have overlapping maxima in the toroidal condensate, which is in

with local updating rules and yet can exhibit, for certain rules, complex, long
space and time correlated patterns. This contrast with other rules which
results in trivial patterns being homogeneous or periodic. In this article we
approach CA from two related angles: we analyze the information transfer in the
time evolution of CA driven sequences and; we revisit the sensibility of the
initial configuration on sequence evolution. In order to do so, we borrow a
recently reported information distance based on Kolmogorov algorithmic
complexity. The normalized information distance has been used previously to
find a hierarchical clustering of CA rules. What is different in our approach,
is the temporal analysis of the sequence evolutions by correlating different
calculated distances with entropy density. Entropy rate, is a length invariant
measure of the amount of irreducible randomness in a dynamical process. In
order to perform our analysis, we incorporate to the practical calculation of
the entropy rate and the distance measure, the use of Lempel-Ziv complexity.
Lempel-Ziv complexity carries a number of practical advantages while avoiding
the uncomputable nature of Kolmogorov randomness. The reduction of entropy
density during time evolution can be related to energy dissipation through
Landauer principle. Related to the last fact, is the computational capabilities
of CA as information processing rules, were the performed analysis could be
used to select CA rules amiable for simulating different physical process. The
tools developed in this article for the analysis of the CA are easily
extendible to the study of other one dimensional dynamical systems.

We find that when most of dependency links are inner- or inter-ones, the
coupled networks system is fragile and makes a discontinuous percolation
transition. However, when the numbers of two types of dependency links are
close to each other, the system is robust and makes a continuous percolation
transition. This indicates that the high density of dependency links could not
always lead to a discontinuous percolation transition as the previous studies.
More interestingly, although the robustness of the system can be optimized by
adjusting the ratio of the two types of dependency links, there exists a
critical average degree of the networks for coupled random networks, below
which the crossover of the two types of percolation transitions disappears, and
the system will always demonstrate a discontinuous percolation transition. We
also develop an approach to analyze this model, which is agreement with the

translate the usual definition of the universal horizon in terms of an optical
scalar built with the preferred flow defined by the preferred spacetime
foliation. The new expression has the advantages of being of quasilocal nature

Therefore, we propose it as a definition for general quasilocal universal
horizons. Using the new formalism we show that there are no universal analog of
cosmological horizons for FLRW models for any scale factor function, and we
also state that quasilocal universal horizons are restricted to trapped regions
of the spacetime. Using the evolution equation, we analyze the formation of
universal horizons under a truncated Horava-Lifshitz theory, in spherical
symmetry, showing the existence of regions in parameter space where the
universal horizon formation cannot be smooth from the center, under some
physically reasonable assumptions. We conclude with our view on the next steps

In addition, we introduce a simulation protocol that allows solid-liquid

experiments. We directly evaluate the value of the interfacial free energy away
from the melting point for a simple but realistic atomic potential, and find a
more complex temperature dependence than the constant positive slope that has
been generally assumed based on phenomenological considerations and that has
been used to interpret experiments. This methodology could be easily extended
to the study of other phase transitions, from condensation to precipitation.

equilibrium, as well as thermal fluctuations. We use the theory to account for
the twisted-to-helical transition of ribbons with spontaneous negative
curvature, and the effect of fluctuations on the corresponding critical
exponents. The persistence length of such ribbons changes non-monotonically
with the ribbon's width, dropping to zero at the transition. This and other
statistical properties qualitatively differ from those of non-frustrated
fluctuating filaments.

  Symbolic Model Checking","preprint",,,,"cs.SE cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We demonstrate the applicability of bandwidth and wavefront reduction
algorithms to static variable ordering. In symbolic model checking event
locality plays a major role in time and memory usage. For example, in Petri
nets event locality can be captured by dependency matrices, where nonzero
entries indicate whether a transition modifies a place. The quality of event
locality has been expressed as a metric called (weighted) event span. The
bandwidth of a matrix is a metric indicating the distance of nonzero elements
to the diagonal. Wavefront is a metric indicating the degree of nonzeros on one
end of the diagonal of the matrix. Bandwidth and wavefront are well studied
metrics used in sparse matrix solvers.
  In this work we prove that span is limited by twice the bandwidth of a
matrix. This observation makes bandwidth reduction algorithms useful for
obtaining good variable orders. One major issue we address is that the
reduction algorithms can only be applied on symmetric matrices, while the
dependency matrices are asymmetric. We show that the Sloan algorithm executed
on the total graph of the adjacency graph gives the best variable orders.
Practically, we demonstrate that our work allows to call standard sparse matrix
operations in Boost and ViennaCL, computing very good static variable orders in
milliseconds. Future work is promising, because a whole new spectrum of more
off-the-shelf algorithms, including metaheuristic ones, become available for
variable ordering.

an overview of MM systems and discuss how realistic power consumption models
can be developed for these systems. Thereby, we discuss and identify few
shortcomings of some of the most prominent EE-maximization techniques present
in the current literature. Then, we discuss ""hybrid MM systems"" operating in a

technology enablers, such as millimetre wave, heterogenous networks, and energy
harvesting networks. Multiple opportunities and challenges arise in such a 5G
architecture because these technologies benefit mutually from each other and
their coexistence introduces several new constraints on the design of
energy-efficient systems. Despite clear evidence that hybrid MM systems can
achieve significantly higher EE gains than conventional MM systems, several
open research problems continue to roadblock system designers from fully
harnessing the EE gains offered by hybrid MM systems. Our discussions lead to
the conclusion that hybrid MM systems offer a sustainable evolution towards 5G

the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) behavior of multilayers, a knowledge of the
dependence of the $GMR$ on magnetic field $H$ appears to be useful. Since a few
specific cases have only been treated theoretically in the literature, it was
decided to carry out a modeling of the $GMR(H)$ curves of
ferromagnetic/non-magnetic (FM/NM) multilayers with various interlayer
couplings. For simplicity, we focused on a trilayer structure (FM1/NM/FM2)
corresponding fairly well to the case of a large number of FM/NM bilayers. To
carry out the calculations, some fundamental assumptions were made: (i) single
domain FM layer, in plane magnetization; (ii) the magnetization of each layer
is the same; (iii) the magnetization vectors rotate in the plane of the layers
in an external magnetic field. In order to calculate the $GMR(H)$ function, we
need to know the magnetization process in the trilayer, i.e., the $M(H)$
function. Therefore, first we calculate the equilibrium angle $\phi(H)$ between
the two magnetization vectors as a function of the field by minimizing the
total energy of the trilayer. According to most previous theoretical and
experimental works, the angular dependence of the GMR is fairly well described
by the relation $GMR(\phi)\propto (1-\cos\phi)$ and we used this relation to
derive the $GMR(H)$ function. Along this line, the $M(H)$ and $GMR(H)$ curves
were calculated for the following cases: (i) pure AF coupling; (ii) pure
orthogonal coupling; (iii) AF coupling and orthogonal coupling simultaneously
present. As to the calculation of the $GMR(H)$ curves, some of these
configurations have not yet been treated formerly or for some specific
parameter values only. For those cases for which calculations were reported in
the literature for $M(H)$ and $GMR(H)$, our results agree with previous
reports.

referred to as quenching, has been attributed to a variety of factors. Some
proposals suggest that erupting active galactic nuclei may strip galaxies of
their interstellar medium, and thus the ability to form stars. Here, we note
that, whereas star formation is universal in small, low-redshift galaxies,
fractional duty cycles of star formation steadily decline in galaxies of
increasing mass, although star formation may not cease entirely. We show that,
when infall of gas from extragalactic space ceases, galaxies of high stellar
mass appear to sustain star formation on gas liberated in mass loss from
evolved low- and intermediate-mass stars admixed with occasional Type II
supernova ejecta. This model quantitatively accounts for the universal limiting
metallicity plateau at a ratio of oxygen to hydrogen atoms, Z(O) = n(O)/n(H) =
0.0013, characterizing high-mass intermittently star-forming galaxies. We show
that, when fractional duty cycles are specifically taken into account, the star
formation rates of galaxies on this plateau correspond to mass loss rates from
evolving stars in rough agreement with observed estimates. Far-infrared
continuum and fine-structure line observations, as well as molecular data, may
soon be able to resolve whether or not low levels of sporadic star formation
can be sustained indefinitely in massive galaxies.

radiation pressure, and photons exchange between neighboring sites is allowed.
After the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of each cell, we show that the
system can be reduced to an effective Hamiltonian of two decoupled bosonic
chains, and therefore we can apply the well-known results regarding quantum
state transfer in conjuction with an additional condition on the transfer
times. In fact, we show that our transfer protocol works for any arbitrary
quantum state, a result that we will illustrate within the red sideband regime.
Finally, in order to give a more realistic scenario we take into account the

GB parameter is small, we find that the non-decoupling modes are the same as
the Schwarzschild case and the decoupled modes are slightly modified by the GB
term. However, when the GB parameter is large, we find some novel features. We
notice that there are another set of non-decoupling modes due to the appearance
of a new plateau in the effective radial potential. Moreover, the effective
radial potential for the decoupled vector-type and scalar-type modes becomes
more complicated. Nevertheless we manage to compute the frequencies of the
these decoupled modes analytically. When the GB parameter is neither very large
nor very small, though analytic computation is not possible, the problem is
much simplified in the large D expansion and could be numerically treated. We

the implementation of a quantum repeater. The performance of quantum repeaters
can be assessed by comparing the attained rate with the quantum and private
capacity of direct transmission, assisted by unlimited classical two-way
communication. However, these quantities are hard to compute, motivating the
search for upper bounds. Takeoka, Guha and Wilde found the squashed
entanglement of a quantum channel to be an upper bound on both these
capacities. In general it is still hard to find the exact value of the squashed
entanglement of a quantum channel, but clever sub-optimal squashing channels
allow one to upper bound this quantity, and thus also the corresponding
capacities. Here, we exploit this idea to obtain bounds for any
phase-insensitive Gaussian bosonic channel. This bound allows one to benchmark
the implementation of quantum repeaters for a large class of channels used to
model communication across fibers. In particular, our bound is applicable to
the realistic scenario when there is a restriction on the mean photon number on
the input. Furthermore, we show that the squashed entanglement of a channel is
convex in the set of channels, and we use a connection between the squashed
entanglement of a quantum channel and its entanglement assisted classical
capacity. Building on this connection, we obtain the exact squashed
entanglement and two-way assisted capacities of the $d$-dimensional erasure
channel and bounds on the amplitude-damping channel and all qubit Pauli
channels. In particular, our bound improves on the previous best known squashed
entanglement upper bound of the depolarizing channel.

in the downlink of small-scale MIMO systems, where a single one of a set of
antenna elements (AEs) is activated for implicitly conveying extra bits. By
contrast, inspired by the compelling benefits of large-scale MIMO (LS- MIMO)
systems, here we propose a LS-SM-MIMO scheme for the uplink (UL), where each
user having multiple AEs but only a single radio frequency (RF) chain invokes
SM for increasing the UL-throughput. At the same time, by relying on hundreds
of AEs but a small number of RF chains, the base station (BS) can
simultaneously serve multiple users whilst reducing the power consumption. Due
to the large number of AEs of the UL-users and the comparably small number of
RF chains at the BS, the UL multi-user signal detection becomes a challenging
large-scale under-determined problem. To solve this problem, we propose a joint
SM transmission scheme and a carefully designed structured compressive sensing
(SCS)-based multi-user detector (MUD) to be used at the users and BS,
respectively. Additionally, the cyclic- prefix single-carrier (CPSC) is used to
combat the multipath channels, and a simple receive AE selection is used for
the improved performance over correlated Rayleigh-fading MIMO channels. We
demonstrate that the aggregate SM signal consisting of SM signals of multiple
UL-users in one CPSC block appears the distributed sparsity. Moreover, due to
the joint SM transmission scheme, aggregate SM signals in the same transmission
group exhibit the group sparsity. By exploiting these intrinsically sparse
features, the proposed SCS-based MUD can reliably detect the resultant SM
signals with low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
SCS-based MUD achieves a better signal detection performance than its
counterparts even with higher UL-throughtput.

derived by introducing absorbing boundary conditions to over-damped continuous
Brownian motion (BM) theory. As there is a clear corresponding stochastic
process, the mathematical description takes both Kolmogorov forward equation
for the evolution of the probability distribution function and the stochastic
sample trajectories. This dual description is a fundamental characteristic of
stochastic processes and allows simple particle based simulations to accurately
match the expected statistical behavior. However, in the traditional theory
using the back-reaction boundary condition to model reversible reactions with
geminate recombinations, several subtleties arise: it is unclear what the
underlying stochastic process is, which causes complications in producing
accurate simulations; and it is non-trivial how to perform an appropriate
discretization for numerical computations. In this work, we derive a discrete
stochastic model that recovers the classical models and their boundary
conditions in the continuous limit. In the case of reversible reactions, we
recover the back-reaction boundary condition, unifying the back-reaction
approach with those of current simulation packages. Furthermore, all the
complications encountered in the continuous models become trivial in the
discrete model. Our formulation brings to attention the question: With
computations in mind, can we develop a discrete reaction kinetics model that is
more fundamental than its continuous counterpart?

prevent identity theft, were then developed for the two categories of

superconductivity performance, which attract much interest in its fundamental
research as well as potential application. In present work, transition from
insulator to superconductor and significant enhancement of superconductivity
were achieved in the high quality (00l) oriented FeSe films via controlling the
thickness as well as the Fe/Se ratio. The highest Tc up to 15.2 K (almost 2
times higher than those of bulk crystals) and Hc2 up to 35.5 T are obtained in
our atmosphere-stable FeSe thin film with practical thickness (240 nm),
implying their great potential application in the electronic devices at high
magnetic fields. More importantly, it was found that the Fe-vacancy disorder in
FeSe films is the intrinsic factor determining the evolution of the
superconductivity, rather than thickness effect. In our non-superconducting
FeSe film with Fe/Se ratio of 1.00:1.09, insulating \b{eta}-Fe1-xSe phase with
iron-vacancy disorders is the main phase and more likely to be the parent phase
of FeSe superconducting system. Tuning the Fe-vacancy disorders via changing
the Fe/Se ratio can dramatically vary the concentration of charge carrier and
introduce proper electron doping, which finally leads to the transition from
insulator to superconductor and further enhancement in the superconductivity.
Intriguingly, our results also indicate that when the Fe/Se ratio of film is
beyond a critical value, superconducting FeSe films will become instable, and
phase separation occurs with new non-superconducting phase precipitating in the
superconducting matrix, causing the degradation in the superconductivity. The
results in present work help us to well understand the intrinsic mechanism of
superconductivity among Fe-Se superconducting system and provide a new strategy
to further pursue higher Tc in these materials.
