calculation due to the digit limitation of floating point, which may lead to
catastrophic loss. Normally, people believe that adjustment of floating-point
precision is an effective way to solve this problem, since high-precision
floating-point has more digits to store information. Thus, it is a prevalent
method to reduce the inaccuracy in much floating-point related research, that
performing all the operations with higher precision. However, we discover that
some operations may lead to larger error in higher precision. In this paper, we
define this kind of operation that generates large error due to precision
adjustment a precision-specific operation. Furthermore, we propose a
light-weight searching algorithm for detecting precision-specific operations

captures the avalanche dynamics of plastic flow in disordered materials. Slip

problems, leading to high impact academic and commercial applications. Recent
work in deep networks highlighted that it is easy to generate images that
humans would never classify as a particular object class, yet networks classify
such images high confidence as that given class - deep network are easily
fooled with images humans do not consider meaningful. The closed set nature of
deep networks forces them to choose from one of the known classes leading to
such artifacts. Recognition in the real world is open set, i.e. the recognition
system should reject unknown/unseen classes at test time. We present a
methodology to adapt deep networks for open set recognition, by introducing a
new model layer, OpenMax, which estimates the probability of an input being
from an unknown class. A key element of estimating the unknown probability is
adapting Meta-Recognition concepts to the activation patterns in the
penultimate layer of the network. OpenMax allows rejection of ""fooling"" and
unrelated open set images presented to the system; OpenMax greatly reduces the
number of obvious errors made by a deep network. We prove that the OpenMax
concept provides bounded open space risk, thereby formally providing an open
set recognition solution. We evaluate the resulting open set deep networks
using pre-trained networks from the Caffe Model-zoo on ImageNet 2012 validation

properties and the anisotropy of diffusivity are also considered. The
implementation in 3D is carried out by isogeometric finite element methods in
order to treat the high order terms in a straightforward sense. The
electrochemical reaction is modeled through a modified Butler-Volmer equation
to account for the influence of the phase change on the reaction on exterior
surfaces. The reaction on the crack surfaces is considered through a volume
source term weighted by a term related to the fracture order parameter. Based
on the model, three characteristic examples are considered to reveal the
electrochemical reactions on particle surfaces, phase interfaces, and crack
surfaces, as well as their influence on the particle material behavior. Results
show that the ratio between the timescale of reaction and the diffusion can
have a significant influence on phase segregation behavior, as well as the
anisotropy of diffusivity. In turn, the distribution of the lithium
concentration greatly influences the reaction on the surface, especially when
the phase interfaces appear on exterior surfaces or crack surfaces. The
reaction rate increases considerably at phase interfaces, due to the large
lithium concentration gradient. Moreover, simulations demonstrate that the
segregation of a Li-rich and a Li-poor phase during delithiation can drive the
cracks to propagate. Results indicate that the model can capture the

at infinity of the Hawking energy along a specific class of geodesic foliations

The problem is significantly harder for social networks where we may reveal

on. In order to address this important challenge, in this paper, we present a
privacy-preserving mechanism that enables private data to be diffused over a

the proposed mechanism returns a differentially private response that ensures
that the amount of private data leaked depends on the distance between the two

acting as analysts, our mechanism guarantees that no individual user, or a

idea of this work is to make use of the flexibility and scalability of the
system such that more benefits can be gained by efficient resource management.
This motivates us to propose a flexible BS power consumption model, which can
control system resources, such as antennas, frequency carriers and transmit
power allocation in an energy efficient manner rather than the ""on/off"" binary
sleep mode for BSs. To denote these power-saving modes, we employ the group
sparsity of the transmit power vector instead of the {0, 1} variables. Based on
this power model, a semi-dynamic green resource management mechanism is
proposed, which can jointly solve a series of resource management problems,
including BS association, frequency carriers (FCs) assignment, and the transmit
power allocation, by group sparse power control based on the large scale fading
values. In particular, the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based
algorithm is applied to solve a stationary solution to the original non-convex
problem. Simulation results also verify the proposed BS power model and the
green resource management mechanism.

the long-term memory burden on recurrent hidden units. In this work we train
the NPI with fully-supervised execution traces; each program has example

Rather than training on a huge number of relatively weak labels, NPI learns

smaller mutual information between transformed components than alternative
methods including ICA and radial Gaussianization. The transformation is
differentiable and can be efficiently inverted, and thus induces a density
model on images. We show that samples of this model are visually similar to
samples of natural image patches. We demonstrate the use of the model as a

we show that the transformation can be cascaded, with each layer optimized

we know of no other bipartite tasks, which admit a device-independent
formulation, but which are not known to be implementable using only bipartite
nonlocality. Another interesting feature of these protocols is that the
pseudo-telepathic nature of GHZ correlations -- in contrast to the generally
statistical character of nonlocal correlations, such as those arising in the
violation of the CHSH inequality -- is essential to their formulation and
analysis. In this work, we present a device-independent bit commitment protocol
based on CHSH testing, which achieves the same security as the optimal
GHZ-based protocol. The protocol is analyzed in the most general settings,
where the devices are used repeatedly and may have long-term quantum memory. We
also recast the protocol in a post-quantum setting where both honest and
dishonest parties are restricted only by the impossibility of signaling, and
find that overall the supra-quantum structure allows for greater security.

synchronize the rotation of planets and moons with the mean orbital motion, or
drive it into long-term stable spin-orbit resonances. As the orbital motion
undergoes periodic acceleration due to a finite orbital eccentricity, the spin
rate oscillates around the equilibrium mean value too, giving rise to the
forced, or eccentricity-driven, librations. Both the shape and amplitude of
forced librations of synchronous viscoelastic planets and moons are defined by
a combination of two different types of perturbative torque, the tidal torque
and the triaxial torque. Consequently, forced librations can be tidally
dominated (e.g., Io and possibly Titan) or deformation-dominated (e.g., the
Moon) depending on a set of orbital, rheological, and other physical
parameters. With small eccentricities, for the former kind, the largest term in
the libration angle can be minus cosine of the mean anomaly, whereas for the
latter kind, it is minus sine of the mean anomaly. The shape and the amplitude
of tidal forced librations determine the rate of orbital evolution of
synchronous planets and moons, i.e., the rate of dissipative damping of
semimajor axis and eccentricity. The known super-Earth exoplanets can exhibit
both kinds of libration, or a mixture thereof, depending on, for example, the
effective Maxwell time of their rigid mantles. Our approach can be extended to
estimate the amplitudes of other libration harmonics, as well as the forced
libration in non-synchronous spin-orbit resonances.

perturbations that result in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) fail, can be
alleviated with a mechanism based on foveations---applying the CNN in different

revision of the hypothesis that adversarial perturbations are a consequence of
CNNs acting as a linear classifier: CNNs act locally linearly to changes in the
image regions with objects recognized by the CNN, and in other regions the CNN
may act non-linearly. Then, we corroborate that when the neural responses are
linear, applying the foveation mechanism to the adversarial example tends to
significantly reduce the effect of the perturbation. This is because,
hypothetically, the CNNs for ImageNet are robust to changes of scale and
translation of the object produced by the foveation, but this property does not
generalize to transformations of the perturbation. As a result, the accuracy
after a foveation is almost the same as the accuracy of the CNN without the
adversarial perturbation, even if the adversarial perturbation is calculated
taking into account a foveation.

Standard Model matter fields of the same flavor, but only to the other two
flavors. This framework respects Minimal Flavor Violation, and is therefore
naturally consistent with flavor constraints. We study the phenomenology of a
benchmark model in which dark matter couples to right-handed charged leptons.
In large regions of parameter space the dark matter can emerge as a thermal
relic, while remaining consistent with the constraints from direct and indirect
detection. The collider signatures of this scenario include events with
multiple leptons and missing energy. These events exhibit a characteristic
flavor pattern that may allow this class of models to be distinguished from
other theories of dark matter.

achieve good performance. In this work, we present a novel method called policy
distillation that can be used to extract the policy of a reinforcement learning
agent and train a new network that performs at the expert level while being
dramatically smaller and more efficient. Furthermore, the same method can be
used to consolidate multiple task-specific policies into a single policy. We
demonstrate these claims using the Atari domain and show that the multi-task
distilled agent outperforms the single-task teachers as well as a
jointly-trained DQN agent.

evaluation and training of deep models can be time-consuming and
computationally expensive. The conditional computation approach has been
proposed to tackle this problem (Bengio et al., 2013; Davis & Arel, 2013). It
operates by selectively activating only parts of the network at a time. In this
paper, we use reinforcement learning as a tool to optimize conditional
computation policies. More specifically, we cast the problem of learning
activation-dependent policies for dropping out blocks of units as a
reinforcement learning problem. We propose a learning scheme motivated by
computation speed, capturing the idea of wanting to have parsimonious
activations while maintaining prediction accuracy. We apply a policy gradient
algorithm for learning policies that optimize this loss function and propose a
regularization mechanism that encourages diversification of the dropout policy.
We present encouraging empirical results showing that this approach improves
the speed of computation without impacting the quality of the approximation.

defined in terms of ordinary differential equations (ODE). The source of

two. The first model, TE2, is a generalization of the seminal model of Tersoff

MM2, is a minimal one constructed ad hoc and in this article it plays a central
role. New scheme for scaling the ODE in vicinal studies is applied towards
deciphering the pre-factors in the time-scaling relations. In all these models
the patterned surface is self-similar - only one length scale is necessary to
describe its evolution (hence B1-type). The bunches form finite angles with the

density traced by the Hi-GAL 500 micron emission varies across the inner

FWHM of 0{\deg}.75, and an average latitude of b=0{\deg}.06, coincident with
the results from ATLASGAL. The GLAT distribution as a function of GLON shows
modulations, both for the diffuse emission and for the compact sources, with

The distortions revealed by Herschel are interpreted as large-scale bending
modes of the Plane. The lack of similar distortions in tracers of more evolved
YSOs or stars rules out gravitational instabilities or satellite-induced
perturbations, as they should act on both the diffuse and stellar disk
components. We propose that the observed bends are caused by incoming flows of
extra-planar gas interacting with the gaseous disk. Stars decouple from the
gaseous ISM and relax into the stellar disk potential. The time required for
the disappearance of the distortions from the diffuse ISM to the relatively
evolved YSO stages are compatible with star-formation timescales.

Khoury and Weltman proposed the so called chameleon field arguing that it could
help avoiding experimental bounds on the WEP while having a non-trivial
cosmological impact. In this paper we revisit the extent to which these
expectations continue to hold as we enter the regime of high precision tests.
The basis of the study is the development of a new method for computing the
force between two massive bodies induced by the chameleon field which takes
into account the influence on the field by both, the large and the test bodies.
We confirm that in the thin shell regime the force does depend non-trivially on
the test body\' s composition, even when the chameleon coupling constants are
universal. We also propose a simple criterion based on energy minimization,
that we use to determine which of the approximations used in computing the
scalar field in a two body problem is better in each specific regime. As an
application of our analysis we then compare the resulting differential
acceleration of two test bodies with the corresponding bounds obtained from
E\""otv\""os type experiments. We consider two setups: 1) an Earth based
experiment where the test bodies are made of Be and Al; 2) the Lunar Laser
Ranging experiment. We find that for some choices of the free parameters of the
chameleon model the predictions of the E\""otv\""os parameter are larger than
some of the previous estimates. As a consequence, we put new constrains on
these free parameters. An important result of our analysis is that our approach
leads to new constraints on the parameter space of the chameleon models.

of ensembling strategies, and then propose and evaluate novel strategies, such
as parameter sharing (through a new family of models we call TreeNets) as well
as training under ensemble-aware and diversity-encouraging losses. We
demonstrate that TreeNets can improve ensemble performance and that diverse

reduced to the Riemann sphere and checked in simple cases. We also proposed
analogous formulae for other theories including maximal super-Yang-Mills theory
and supergravity in other dimensions at one loop. We give further details of
these results and extend them in two directions. Firstly, we propose new
formulae for the one-loop integrands of Yang-Mills theory and gravity in the
absence of supersymmetry. These follow from the identification of the states
running in the loop as expressed in the ambitwistor-string correlator.
Secondly, we give a systematic proof of the non-supersymmetric formulae using
the worldsheet factorisation properties of the nodal Riemann sphere underlying
the scattering equations at one loop. Our formulae have the same decomposition
under the recently introduced Q-cuts as one-loop integrands and hence give the
correct amplitudes.

multiple exchanges of semi-soft gluons as a basic QCD mechanism to understand
diffractive electron-proton scattering at the HERA collider. Based on the
kinematics of individual events in the standard QCD description of deep
inelastic scattering at the parton level, which at low $x$ is dominantly
gluon-initiated, the probability is evaluated for additional exchanges of
softer gluons resulting in an overall colour singlet exchange leading to a
forward proton and a rapidity gap as the characteristic observables for
diffractive scattering. The probability depends on the impact parameter of the
soft exchanges and varies with the transverse size of the hard scattering
subsystem and is therefore influenced by different QCD effects. We account for
matrix elements and parton shower evolution either via conventional DGLAP $\log
Q^2$-evolution with collinear factorisation or CCFM small-$x$ evolution with
$k_\perp$-factorisation and discuss the sensitivity to the gluon density
distribution in the proton and the importance of large log\,$x$-contributions.
The overall result is that, with only two model parameters which have
theoretically motivated values, a satisfactory description of the observed
diffractive cross-section at HERA is obtained in a wide kinematical range.

difficult to generalize to unseen data. Recent advances in regularization
techniques, such as pretraining and dropout, indicate that modeling input data
distribution (either explicitly or implicitly) greatly improves the
generalization ability of a DNN. In this work, we explore the manifold
hypothesis which assumes that instances within the same class lie in a smooth
manifold. We accordingly propose two simple regularizers to a standard
discriminative DNN. The first one, named Label-Aware Manifold Regularization,
assumes the availability of labels and penalizes large norms of the loss
function w.r.t. data points. The second one, named Label-Independent Manifold
Regularization, does not use label information and instead penalizes the
Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of prediction scores w.r.t. data points,

analogue of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. This means, SPt phases
can be adiabatically connected to a product state by some path that preserves
the protecting symmetry. Moreover, SPt and SPT phases can be adiabatically
connected to each other when interaction terms that break the symmetries
protecting the SPT order are added in the Hamiltonian. It is also known that
spin-1 SPT phases in quantum spin chains can emerge as effective intermediate
phases of spin-2 Hamiltonians. In this paper we show that a similar scenario is
also valid for SPt phases. More precisely, we show that for a given spin-2
quantum chain, effective intermediate spin-1 SPt phases emerge in some regions
of the phase diagram, these also being adiabatically connected to non-trivial
intermediate SPT phases. We characterize the phase diagram of our model by
studying quantities such as the entanglement entropy, symmetry-related order
parameters, and 1-site fidelities. Our numerical analysis uses Matrix Product
States (MPS) and the infinite Time-Evolving Block Decimation (iTEBD) method to
approximate ground states of the system in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover,
we provide a field theory description of the possible quantum phase transitions
between the SPt phases. Together with the numerical results, such a description
shows that the transitions may be described by Conformal Field Theories (CFT)

contrast, during periods where many connections are unexpectedly strong/weak,
default mode regions dissociate and form distinct modules. Finally, we go on to
show that, while all functional connections can at times manifest stronger

because of a lack of systematic studies. There were some suggestions that nova
rates per unit mass in the Magellanic Clouds were higher than in any other
galaxy. Here, we present an analysis of data collected over 16 years by the
OGLE survey with the aim of characterizing the nova population in the Clouds.
We found 20 eruptions of novae, half of which are new discoveries. We robustly
measure nova rates of $2.4 \pm 0.8$ yr$^{-1}$ (LMC) and $0.9 \pm 0.4$ yr$^{-1}$
(SMC) and confirm that the K-band luminosity-specific nova rates in both Clouds
are 2-3 times higher than in other galaxies. This can be explained by the star
formation history in the Magellanic Clouds, specifically the re-ignition of the
star formation rate a few Gyr ago. We also present the discovery of the
intriguing system OGLE-MBR133.25.1160 which mimics recurrent nova eruptions.

Dirichlet generating series that enumerates all finite-index subgroups whose

pro-isomorphic zeta functions of $\mathbb{Q}$-indecomposable $D^*$-groups of
even Hirsch length. These groups are building blocks of finitely generated
class-two nilpotent groups with rank-two centre, up to commensurability. Due to
a classification by Grunewald and Segal, they are parameterised by primary
polynomials whose companion matrices define commutator relations for an
explicit presentation. For Grunewald--Segal representatives of even Hirsch
length of type $f(t)=t^m$, we give a complete description of the algebraic
automorphism groups of associated Lie lattices. Utilising the automorphism
groups, we determine the local pro-isomorphic zeta functions of groups
associated to $t^2$ and $t^3$. In both cases, the local zeta functions are
uniform in the prime~$p$ and satisfy functional equations. The functional
equations for these groups, not predicted by the currently available theory,
prompt us to formulate a conjecture which prescribes, in particular,
information about the symmetry factor appearing in local functional equations
for pro-isomorphic zeta functions of nilpotent groups. Our description of the
local zeta functions also yields information about the analytic properties of
the corresponding global pro-isomorphic zeta functions. Some of our results for
the $D^*$-groups associated to $t^2$ and $t^3$ generalise to two infinite

to a discontinuous unit step function. We prove that spatially localized
solutions to the fixed point problem for large $\beta$ exist and can be
approximated by the fixed points of $\cH_\infty.$ These results are of a high
importance in biological applications where one often approximates the smooth
sigmoid by discontinuous unit step function. Moreover, in order to achieve even
better approximation than a solution of the limit problem, we employ the
iterative method that has several advantages compared to other existing
methods. For example, this method can be used to construct non-isolated
homoclinic orbit of a Hamiltionian system of equations. We illustrate the
results and advantages of the numerical method for stationary versions of the

against short-range electron-electron interaction and quenched time-reversal
symmetric disorder (but excluding mass disorder). First we focus on the clean
interacting and the noninteracting dirty Dirac semimetal separately, and show
that they support two distinct quantum critical points. Using renormalization
group techniques, we find that while interaction driven quantum critical points
are \emph{Gaussian} (mean-field) in nature, describing quantum phase
transitions into various broken symmetry phases, the ones controlled by
disorder are \emph{non-Gaussian}, capturing the transition to a metallic phase.
We classify such diffusive quantum critical points based on the transformation
of disorder vertices under a \emph{continuous} chiral rotation. Our wek
coupling renormalization group analysis suggests that two distinct quantum
critical points are stable in an interacting dirty Dirac semimetal (with chiral
symmetric randomness), and a multicritical point (at finite interaction and
disorder) results from their interplay. By contrast, the chiral symmetry
breaking disorder driven critical point is unstable against weak interactions.
Effects of weak disorder on the ordering tendencies in Dirac semimetal are
analyzed. The clean interacting critical points, however, satisfy the
\emph{Harris criterion}, and are therefore expected to be unstable against bond
disorder. Although our weak coupling analysis is inadequate to establish the
ultimate stability of these fixed points in the strong coupling regime (when
both interaction and disorder are strong), they can still govern crossover
behaviors in Dirac semimetals over a large length scale, when either
interaction or randomness is sufficiently weak.

features that may explain enigmatic aspects of X-ray binary behaviour. The
structure and evolution of these discs are governed by a dynamo-like mechanism,
which channels part of the accretion power liberated by the magnetorotational
instability (MRI) into an ordered toroidal magnetic field. To study dynamo
activity, we performed three-dimensional, stratified, isothermal, ideal
magnetohydrodynamic shearing box simulations. The strength of the
self-sustained toroidal magnetic field depends on the net vertical magnetic
flux, which we vary across almost the entire range over which the MRI is
linearly unstable. We quantify disc structure and dynamo properties as a
function of the initial ratio of mid-plane gas pressure to vertical magnetic
field pressure, $\beta_0^{\rm mid} = p_{\rm gas} / p_B$. For $10^5 \geq
\beta_0^{\rm mid} \geq 10$ the effective $\alpha$-viscosity parameter scales as
a power-law. Dynamo activity persists up to and including $\beta_0^{\rm mid} =
10^2$, at which point the entire vertical column of the disc is magnetic
pressure-dominated. Still stronger fields result in a highly inhomogeneous disc
structure, with large density fluctuations. We show that the turbulent steady
state $\beta^{\rm mid}$ in our simulations is well-matched by the analytic
model of Begelman et al. (2015) describing the creation and buoyant escape of
toroidal field, while the vertical structure of the disc can be broadly
reproduced using this model. Finally, we discuss the implications of our
results for observed properties of X-ray binaries.

revealed that the Milky Way's metallicity distribution function (MDF) changes
shape as a function of radius, transitioning from being negatively skewed at
small Galactocentric radii to positively skewed at large Galactocentric radii.
Using a high resolution, N-body+SPH simulation, we show that the changing
skewness arises from radial migration - metal-rich stars form in the inner disk
and subsequently migrate to the metal-poorer outer disk. These migrated stars
represent a large fraction (> 50%) of the stars in the outer disk; they
populate the high metallicity tail of the MDFs and are, in general, more
metal-rich than the surrounding outer disk gas. The simulation also reproduces
another surprising APOGEE result: the spatially invariant high-[alpha/Fe] MDFs.
This arises in the simulation from the migration of a population formed within
a narrow range of radii (3.2+/-1.2 kpc) and time (8.8+/-0.6 Gyr ago), rather
than from spatially extended star formation in a homogeneous medium at early
times. These results point toward the crucial role radial migration has played
in shaping our Milky Way.

Empirical reduction requires one theory to encompass the range of physical

three-place, a posteriori relation connecting the theories and the domain of
physical reality that both serve to describe. Focusing on the relationship
between classical and quantum mechanics, I argue that while certain formal

taken to preclude the possibility of reduction between these theories, such
results at most block reduction in the formal sense; little if any reason has
been given for thinking that they block reduction in the empirical sense. I

be decoupled from the bulk of technical analysis necessary to recover

so, I demonstrate that the account of classical behavior provided by
decoherence theory can be straightforwardly tailored to give accounts of
classical behavior on multiple interpretations of quantum theory, including the
Everett, de Broglie-Bohm and GRW interpretations. I further show that this
interpretation-neutral, decoherence-based account conforms to a general view of
inter-theoretic reduction in physics that I have elaborated elsewhere, which
differs from the oversimplified picture that treats reduction as a matter of
simply taking limits. This interpretation-neutral account rests on a general
three-pronged strategy for reduction between quantum and classical theories
that combines decoherence, an appropriate form of Ehrenfest's Theorem, and a
decoherence-compatible mechanism for collapse. It also incorporates a novel
argument as to why branch-relative trajectories should be approximately
Newtonian, which is based on a little-discussed extension of Ehrenfest's
Theorem to open systems, rather than on the more commonly cited but less
germane closed-systems version. In the Conclusion, I briefly suggest how the
strategy for quantum-classical reduction described here might be extended to
reduction between other classical and quantum theories, including classical and

More specifically, using the unified framework, we develop a family of gradient

w.r.t. inputs. Our proposed framework is appealing in that it offers a unified
view to deal with adversarial examples. It incorporates another
recently-proposed perturbation based approach as a special case. In addition,
we present some visual effects that reveals semantic meaning in those
perturbations, and thus support our regularization method and provide another
explanation for generalizability of adversarial examples. By applying this
technique to Maxout networks, we conduct a series of experiments and achieve
encouraging results on two benchmark datasets. In particular,we attain the best

For $R_0 = 8$ kpc, the models have stellar mass $5 < M_* < 6 \times 10^{10}$

of the solar neighborhood may have a somewhat lower stellar surface density
than average for the solar circle. The Milky Way appears to be a normal spiral
galaxy that obeys scaling relations like the Tully-Fisher relation, the
size-mass relation, and the disk maximality-surface brightness relation. The
stellar disk is maximal, and the spiral arms are massive. The bumps and wiggles
in the terminal velocity curve correspond to known spiral features (e.g., the
Centaurus Arm is a $\sim 50\%$ overdensity). The rotation curve switches
between positive and negative over scales of hundreds of parsecs. The rms
amplitude $\langle$$|$$dV/dR$$|^2$$\rangle$$^{1/2} \approx 14$ km s$^{-1}$
kpc$^{-1}$, implying that commonly neglected terms in the Jeans equations may
be non-negligible. The spherically averaged local dark matter density is
$\rho_{0,DM} \approx 0.009$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$ (0.3 GeV cm$^{-3}$).
Adiabatic compression of the dark matter halo may help reconcile the Milky Way
with the $c$-$V_{200}$ relation expected in $\Lambda$CDM while also helping to
mitigate the too big to fail problem, but it remains difficult to reconcile the
inner bulge/bar dominated region with a cuspy halo. We note that NGC 3521 is a
near twin to the Milky Way, having a similar luminosity, scale length, and

region of uncertain wind generation considering small-signal stability (SSAR)
is introduced to geometrically measure how much uncertain wind generation can
be accommodated by a bulk power system without breaking its small-signal

higher-dimensional injection space that incorporates both the conventional
nodal generation injections and the WPIs, and then mapping it onto the
lower-dimensional WPI space. Case studies on the modified New England 39-bus
system with multiple wind farms illustrate the SSAR concept and its potential

Go engines such as Pachi [Baudis & Gailly (2012)] if its search budget is

DCNN designed for long-term predictions. Darkforest substantially improves the
win rate for pattern-matching approaches against MCTS-based approaches, even

in which neoclassical ion poloidal flow damping is not strong enough to enhance
the magnitude of the polarization current (relative to that found in slab
geometry). Second, a regime in which neoclassical ion poloidal flow damping is
strong enough to significantly enhance the magnitude of the polarization

chain that has been brought to rest in the laboratory frame via interaction
with a static, resonant, magnetic perturbation). In all cases, the polarization

eta_i = d ln T_i/d ln n_e does not exceed some threshold value. In certain

galaxy in the all-combined ACS image with 5sigma-limiting magnitude of
mACS~30.6 ABmag, which corresponds to ~1.6x10^7M_sun at the redshift. The
photometric redshift measured with 12 multi-band images confirms 34 satellites
out of the candidates. Most of the satellites are found to have the rest-frame
colors consistent with star forming galaxies. We investigate the relation
between stellar mass and star formation rate (the star formation main
sequence), and find the steeper slope at the low-mass end (<10^8M_sun), while
more massive satellites are consistently on the sequence reported in previous

we conjecture possible scenarios for the compact galaxy which evolves to a
local massive galaxy by way of significant size and mass growth. While merging

the mass growth predicted by observations and simulations, the contribution by
in-situ star formation in the satellites would compensate the deficit. Provided
that most satellites keep the observed in-situ star formation and then quench

performance, but also within individuals co-occurring with fluctuations in
network properties of functional connectivity, estimated over short time
intervals. However, characteristics of these time-resolved functional networks
during periods of high and low modularity have remained largely unexplored. In
this study we investigate spatiotemporal properties of time-resolved networks
in the high and low modularity periods during rest, with a particular focus on
their spatial connectivity patterns, temporal homogeneity and test-retest
reliability. We show that spatial connectivity patterns of time-resolved
networks in the high and low modularity periods are represented by increased
and decreased dissociation of the default mode network module from
task-positive network modules, respectively. We also find that the instances of
time-resolved functional connectivity sampled from within the high (low)
modularity period are relatively homogeneous (heterogeneous) over time,
indicating that during the low modularity period the default mode network
interacts with other networks in a variable manner. We confirmed that the
occurrence of the high and low modularity periods varies across individuals
with moderate inter-session test-retest reliability and that it is correlated
with previously-reported individual differences in the modularity of functional
connectivity estimated over longer timescales. Our findings illustrate how
time-resolved functional networks are spatiotemporally organized during periods

recognizers, as opposed to the usual passive recognizers which classifies a
given static image into a predefined set of object categories. In this paper we
propose to generalize these recently proposed end-to-end active visual
recognizers into a controller-recognizer framework. A model in the
controller-recognizer framework consists of a controller, which interfaces with
an external manipulator, and a recognizer which classifies the visual input
adjusted by the manipulator. We describe two most recently proposed
controller-recognizer models: recurrent attention model and spatial transformer
network as representative examples of controller-recognizer models. Based on
this description we observe that most existing end-to-end
controller-recognizers tightly, or completely, couple a controller and
recognizer. We ask a question whether this tight coupling is necessary, and try
to answer this empirically by building a controller-recognizer model with a
decoupled controller and recognizer. Our experiments revealed that it is not
always necessary to tightly couple them and that by decoupling a controller and

reason, semi-supervised learning remains a topic of practical importance. The
recently proposed Ladder Network is one such approach that has proven to be
very successful. In addition to the supervised objective, the Ladder Network
also adds an unsupervised objective corresponding to the reconstruction costs
of a stack of denoising autoencoders. Although the empirical results are
impressive, the Ladder Network has many components intertwined, whose
contributions are not obvious in such a complex architecture. In order to help
elucidate and disentangle the different ingredients in the Ladder Network
recipe, this paper presents an extensive experimental investigation of variants
of the Ladder Network in which we replace or remove individual components to
gain more insight into their relative importance. We find that all of the
components are necessary for achieving optimal performance, but they do not
contribute equally. For semi-supervised tasks, we conclude that the most
important contribution is made by the lateral connection, followed by the
application of noise, and finally the choice of what we refer to as the
`combinator function' in the decoder path. We also find that as the number of
labeled training examples increases, the lateral connections and reconstruction
criterion become less important, with most of the improvement in generalization
being due to the injection of noise in each layer. Furthermore, we present a
new type of combinator function that outperforms the original design in both
fully- and semi-supervised tasks, reducing record test error rates on
Permutation-Invariant MNIST to 0.57% for the supervised setting, and to 0.97%

discriminative information, they tend to have a low-spatial resolution.
Low-level percepts, on the other hand, preserve a higher spatial resolution

leads to high-dimensionality video representations. To mitigate this effect and
control the model number of parameters, we introduce a variant of the GRU model

received much attention lately due to their impressive performance in numerous

data-driven word representation learning methods do not consider the rich
semantic relational structure between words in a co-occurring context. On the

semantic lexicons such as the WordNet that represent the meanings of words by
defining the various relationships that exist among the words in a language. We
consider the question, can we improve the word representations learnt using a
corpora by integrating the knowledge from semantic lexicons?. For this purpose,
we propose a joint word representation learning method that simultaneously
predicts the co-occurrences of two words in a sentence subject to the
relational constrains given by the semantic lexicon. We use relations that
exist between words in the lexicon to regularize the word representations
learnt from the corpus. Our proposed method statistically significantly
outperforms previously proposed methods for incorporating semantic lexicons
into word representations on several benchmark datasets for semantic similarity

machine learning. Supervised learning is successful because it can be solved by
the minimization of the training error cost function. Unsupervised learning is
not as successful, because the unsupervised objective may be unrelated to the
supervised task of interest. For an example, density modelling and
reconstruction have often been used for unsupervised learning, but they did not
produced the sought-after performance gains, because they have no knowledge of
the supervised tasks.
  In this paper, we present an unsupervised cost function which we name the
Output Distribution Matching (ODM) cost, which measures a divergence between
the distribution of predictions and distributions of labels. The ODM cost is
appealing because it is consistent with the supervised cost in the following
sense: a perfect supervised classifier is also perfect according to the ODM
cost. Therefore, by aggressively optimizing the ODM cost, we are almost
guaranteed to improve our supervised performance whenever the space of possible
predictions is exponentially large.
  We demonstrate that the ODM cost works well on number of small and
semi-artificial datasets using no (or almost no) labelled training cases.
Finally, we show that the ODM cost can be used for one-shot domain adaptation,

The source decayed slowly as the stellar remnants were accreted onto the BH,
before abruptly shutting off. Here we present the definitive XRT team light
curve for Swift J164449.3+573451 and discuss its implications. We show that the
unabsorbed flux decayed roughly as a $t^{-1.5}$ power law up to August 17,
2012. The steep turnoff of an order of magnitude in 24 hours seems to be
consistent with the shutdown of the jet as the accretion disk transitioned from
a thick disk to a thin disk. Swift continues to monitor this source in case the
jet reactivates.

standard EEG analysis techniques that ignore such spatial information. Next, we
train a deep recurrent-convolutional network inspired by state-of-the-art video
classification to learn robust representations from the sequence of images. The
proposed approach is designed to preserve the spatial, spectral, and temporal

variations and distortions within each dimension. Empirical evaluation on the
cognitive load classification task demonstrated significant improvements in
classification accuracy over current state-of-the-art approaches in this field.

emph{surrogate loss} function, such as for instance cross-entropy or hinge
loss. In order for this remedy to be effective, it is important to ensure that
minimization of the surrogate loss results in minimization of the task loss, a
condition that we call emph{consistency with the task loss}. In this work, we
propose another method for deriving differentiable surrogate losses that
provably meet this requirement. We focus on the broad class of models that
define a score for every input-output pair. Our idea is that this score can be
interpreted as an estimate of the task loss, and that the estimation error may
be used as a consistent surrogate loss. A distinct feature of such an approach
is that it defines the desirable value of the score for every input-output

Encoder-Decoder models often used for sequence prediction tasks. In our
experiment, we benchmark on the task of speech recognition. Using a new
surrogate loss instead of cross-entropy to train an Encoder-Decoder speech

visual ability which yields important information about the 3D world. In this
paper we propose a deep network architecture, called DOC, which acts on a
single image, detects object boundaries and estimates the border ownership
(i.e. which side of the boundary is foreground and which is background). We
represent occlusion relations by a binary edge map, to indicate the object
boundary, and an occlusion orientation variable which is tangential to the
boundary and whose direction specifies border ownership by a left-hand rule. We
train two related deep convolutional neural networks, called DOC, which exploit
local and non-local image cues to estimate this representation and hence
recover occlusion relations. In order to train and test DOC we construct a
large-scale instance occlusion boundary dataset using PASCAL VOC images, which
we call the PASCAL instance occlusion dataset (PIOD). This contains 10,000
images and hence is two orders of magnitude larger than existing occlusion
datasets for outdoor images. We test two variants of DOC on PIOD and on the
BSDS occlusion dataset and show they outperform state-of-the-art methods.
Finally, we perform numerous experiments investigating multiple settings of DOC
and transfer between BSDS and PIOD, which provides more insights for further
study of occlusion estimation.

total work, where $N$ is the size of the constraint matrix and $\epsilon$ is
the error parameter, and where the $\tilde{O}$ hides logarithmic factors. To
achieve our improvement, we introduce an algorithmic technique of broader
interest: dynamically-bucketed selective coordinate descent (DB-SCD). At each
step of the iterative optimization algorithm, the DB-SCD method dynamically
buckets the coordinates of the gradient into those of roughly equal magnitude,
and it updates all the coordinates in one of the buckets. This
dynamically-bucketed updating permits us to take steps along several
coordinates with similar-sized gradients, thereby permitting more appropriate
step sizes at each step of the algorithm. In particular, this technique allows
us to use in a straightforward manner the recent analysis from the breakthrough
results of Allen-Zhu and Orecchia [2] to achieve our still-further improved
bounds. More generally, this method addresses ""interference"" among coordinates,
by which we mean the impact of the update of one coordinate on the gradients of
other coordinates. Such interference is a core issue in parallelizing
optimization routines that rely on smoothness properties. Since our DB-SCD
method reduces interference via updating a selective subset of variables at
each iteration, we expect it may also have more general applicability in
optimization.

channels. Especially, in our encoding scheme the information of the input state
is only distributed on three of the five channels and thus any error appearing
in the remained two channels never affects the output state, i.e. the output
quantum state is immune from the error in the two channels. The stochastic
error on a single channel is corrected for both vacuum and squeezed input
states and the achieved fidelities of the output states are beyond the
corresponding classical limit.

linear programming (LP). They did not consider the standard form: minimize
c^{T}x, subject to Ax=b, x>0. Instead, they studied a peculiar form: minimize
c^{T}x, subject to Ax = b, Bx>0, where B is a non-singular matrix. In this
note, we stress that the proposed peculiar form is unsolvable and meaningless.
The two schemes have confused the functional inequality constraints Bx>0 with
the nonnegativity constraints x>0 in the linear programming model. But the
condition x>0 is indispensable to the simplex method. Therefore, both two
schemes failed.

show that this star is a mid M-type dwarf with an effective temperature $= 3327

away and its space motion, rotation period, and lack of H$\alpha$ emission
indicate it is an older member of the ""thin disk"" population. On the other
hand, the star exhibits excess infrared emission suggesting a dust disk more
typical of a very young star. If the KOI 6705.01 signal is produced by a
planet, the transit depth of 60 ppm means its radius is only
$0.26^{+0.034}_{-0.029} R_{\oplus}$, or about the size of the Moon. However,
the duration ($\gtrsim 3$~hr) and time variation of KOI 6705.01 are anomalous:
the signal was undetected in the first two years of the mission and increased
through the latter two years. These characteristics require implausible orbits
and material properties for any planet and rule out such an explanation,
although a dust cloud is possible. We excluded several false positive scenarios
including background stars, scattered light from stars that are nearby on the
sky, and electronic cross-talk between detector readout channels. We find the
most likely explanation to be that KOI 6705.01 is a false positive created by
charge transfer inefficiency in a detector column on which KIC 6423922 and a
1.99 d eclipsing binary both happened to fall.

on large scale data. However binary embedding typically requires long codes in
order to preserve the discriminative power of the input space. Thus binary
coding methods traditionally suffer from high computation and storage costs in
such a scenario. To address this problem, we propose Circulant Binary Embedding
(CBE) which generates binary codes by projecting the data with a circulant
matrix. The circulant structure allows us to use Fast Fourier Transform
algorithms to speed up the computation. For obtaining $k$-bit binary codes from
$d$-dimensional data, this improves the time complexity from $O(dk)$ to
$O(d\log{d})$, and the space complexity from $O(dk)$ to $O(d)$.
  We study two settings, which differ in the way we choose the parameters of
the circulant matrix. In the first, the parameters are chosen randomly and in
the second, the parameters are learned using the data. For randomized CBE, we
give a theoretical analysis comparing it with binary embedding using an
unstructured random projection matrix. The challenge here is to show that the
dependencies in the entries of the circulant matrix do not lead to a loss in
performance. In the second setting, we design a novel time-frequency
alternating optimization to learn data-dependent circulant projections, which
alternatively minimizes the objective in original and Fourier domains. In both
the settings, we show by extensive experiments that the CBE approach gives much
better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches if we fix a running
time, and provides much faster computation with negligible performance
degradation if we fix the number of bits in the embedding.

  Two concepts of modularity are examined: computational modularity where
physical correctness is retained and behavioural modularity where module

computational modularity, bond graphs provide a natural formulation of
behavioural modularity and reveal the sources of retroactivity. A bond graph

motivated by an analysis of the energy landscape of a particular class of deep
networks with sparse random weights. The loss function of such networks can be
approximated by the Hamiltonian of a spherical spin glass with Gaussian
coupling. While different from currently-popular architectures such as
convolutional ones, spin glasses are amenable to analysis, which provides
insights on the topology of the loss function and motivates algorithms to
minimize it. Specifically, we show that a regularization term akin to a
magnetic field can be modulated with a single scalar parameter to transition
the loss function from a complex, non-convex landscape with exponentially many
local minima, to a phase with a polynomial number of minima, all the way down
to a trivial landscape with a unique minimum. AnnealSGD starts training in the
relaxed polynomial regime and gradually tightens the regularization parameter
to steer the energy towards the original exponential regime. Even for
convolutional neural networks, which are quite unlike sparse random networks,
we empirically show that AnnealSGD improves the generalization error using

can be much lowered by optimizing the word-length of weights and signals.
Direct quantization of floating-point weights, however, does not show good
performance when the number of bits assigned is small. Retraining of quantized
networks has been developed to relieve this problem. In this work, the effects
of retraining are analyzed for a feedforward deep neural network (FFDNN) and a
convolutional neural network (CNN). The network complexity is controlled to
know their effects on the resiliency of quantized networks by retraining. The
complexity of the FFDNN is controlled by varying the unit size in each hidden
layer and the number of layers, while that of the CNN is done by modifying the
feature map configuration. We find that the performance gap between the
floating-point and the retrain-based ternary (+1, 0, -1) weight neural networks
exists with a fair amount in 'complexity limited' networks, but the discrepancy
almost vanishes in fully complex networks whose capability is limited by the
training data, rather than by the number of connections. This research shows
that highly complex DNNs have the capability of absorbing the effects of severe
weight quantization through retraining, but connection limited networks are
less resilient. This paper also presents the effective compression ratio to
guide the trade-off between the network size and the precision when the
hardware resource is limited.

density, in the single layer coating the inner surface of the cavity. If the
substrate is very weak (e.g., Li), on the other hand, a superfluid two-shell
structure can form, whose physical properties interpolate between two and three
dimensions. It is shown how experimental signatures of this physical behavior
can be detected through measurements of the momentum distribution.

heterogeneity, dynamics and prediction hardness because the access to natural

power of the harvested energy is weak. It results in the energy waste to store
the harvested energy indirectly. These features bring challenging and
interesting issues on efficient allocation of the harvested energy. This paper
studies the \emph{stochastic duty cycling} by considering these features with
the objective characterized by maximizing the common active time. We consider
two cases: offline and online stochastic duty cycling. For the offline case, we
design an optimal solution: offline duty cycling algorithm. For the online
case, we design an online duty cycling algorithm, which achieves the
approximation ratio with at least $1-e^{-\gamma^2}$, where $\gamma$ is the
probability able to harvest energy. We also evaluate our algorithms with the

that the performance of the online algorithm can be very close to the offline

illumination on a direct-drive fuel target, the fuel target physics, the
uniformity of the HIF target implosion, the smoothing mechanisms of the target
implosion non- uniformity and the robust target implosion. The HIB has
remarkable preferable features to release the fusion energy in inertial fusion:
in particle accelerators HIBs are generated with a high driver efficiency of ~
30-40%, and the HIB ions deposit their energy inside of materials. Therefore, a
requirement for the fusion target energy gain is relatively low, that would be
~50-70 to operate a HIF fusion reactor with the standard energy output of 1GW
of electricity. The HIF reactor operation frequency would be ~10~15 Hz or so.
Several- MJ HIBs illuminate a fusion fuel target, and the fuel target is
imploded to about a thousand times of the solid density. Then the DT fuel is
ignited and burned. The HIB ion deposition range is defined by the HIB ions
stopping length, which would be ~1 mm or so depending on the material.
Therefore, a relatively large density-scale length appears in the fuel target
material. One of the critical issues in inertial fusion would be a spherically
uniform target compression, which would be degraded by a non-uniform implosion.
The implosion non-uniformity would be introduced by the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T)
instability, and the large density-gradient-scale length helps to reduce the
R-T growth rate.

propose a quantum version of the Friedmann equations. In particular, starting
from the differential version of the first law of thermodynamics, we are able
to find planckian (non commutative) corrections to the Friedmann flat
equations. The so modified equations are formally similar to the ones present
in Gauss-Bonnet gravity, but in the ordinary 3+1 dimensions. As a consequence
of these corrections, by considering negative fluctuations in the internal
energy that are allowed by quantum field theory, our equations imply a maximum
value both for the energy density $\rho$ and for the Hubble flow $H$, i.e. the
big bang is ruled out. Conversely, by considering positive quantum
fluctuations, we found no maximum for $\rho$ and $H$. Nevertheless, by starting
with an early time energy density $\rho\sim 1/t^2$, we obtain a value for the
scale factor $a(t)\sim e^{\sqrt{t}}$, implying a finite planckian universe at
$t=0$, i.e. the point-like big bang singularity is substituted by a universe of
planckian size at $t=0$. Finally, we found possible higher order planckian
terms to our equations together with the related corrections of our generalized
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

Here we explore the topological excitations which arise in a model of cold

homotopy analysis and analytic field-theory we identify a new family of
solitonic wave functions characterised by integer charge ${\bf Q} = (Q_A, Q_B,

are stable, wave functions with more general charge spontaneously decay into
pairs of solitons with emergent interactions. This result suggests that it
could be possible to realise a new class of interacting soliton, with no

these results, we find that superconductivity can be strongly suppressed by the
ordering competition, and also extract the $T$-dependence of superfluid

our RG analysis reveal that the nematic order exists only in an intermediate
temperature region $T_{m}< T < T_{n}$, but is destroyed at $T > T_{n}$ by
thermal fluctuation and at $T < T_{m}$ by ordering competition. This anomalous
existence of nematic order leads to a back-bending of the nematic transition

tetragonal structure at low temperatures. A modified phase diagram is obtained

both quality of service and secrecy outage constraints. We propose a simple
protocol to enhance security via transmit antenna selection, and then assess
its performance in closed-form by means of secrecy outage and successful
transmission probabilities. We assume these probabilities are our constraints
and then maximize the secure throughput, establishing a security-reliability
trade-off for the proposed scenario. Our numerical results illustrate the
effect of this trade-off on the secure throughput as well as on the number of
antennas at Alice, Bob and Eve. Interestingly, a small sacrifice in reliability
allows secrecy enhancement in terms of secure bps/Hz. We apply this idea in our
smart grid application to exemplify that, although Eve may acquire some samples
of the average power demand of a household, it is not enough to properly
reconstruct such curve.

cosmography to the most relevant cosmological quantities and to several dark
energy models. We also investigate whether cosmography is able to provide
information about the form of the cosmological expansion history, discussing
how to reproduce the dark fluid from the cosmographic sound speed. Following
this, we discuss limits on cosmographic priors and focus on how to
experimentally treat cosmographic expansions. Finally, we present some of the
latest developments of the cosmographic method, reviewing the use of rational
approximations, based on cosmographic Pad\'e polynomials. Future prospects
leading to more accurate cosmographic results, able to better reproduce the
expansion history of the universe are also discussed in detail.

ALMA Regional Centers (ARCs). Since we just synchronize all datasets with those
of ARCs, the metadata are identical to the upstream, including ``target name''
for each dataset. The name is not necessarily a common one like NGC numbers,
but sometimes one of sequential numbers assigned in an observation proposal.
Compilation of these artificial names into astronomical ones could provide
users more flexible and powerful search interfaces; for instance, with the
knowledge of the redshift for each source, the users can easily find the
datasets which observed their interested emission/absorption lines at not the
observer frame but the rest frame, fitting well with theoretical studies. To
implement this functionality, cross-identification of all the sources in our

is required. We developed a tiny Java application named ``Blade Runner'' for
this purpose. The program works as a crawler for both the JVO ALMA Archive and

portable design enables us to communicate results to each other even under
different computing environments. In this paper, we introduce its software

control the gap structure and properties of the gamma-ray spectrum. Our model
assumes that the injection rate is time variable and the observed gamma-ray
spectrum are superposition of the emissions from different gap structures with
different injection rates at the gap boundaries. The calculated spectrum
superposed by assuming power law distribution of the particle injection rate
can reproduce sub-exponential cut-off feature in the gamma-ray spectrum
observed by Fermi-LAT. We fit the phase-averaged spectra for 43
young/middle-age pulsars and 14 millisecond pulsars with the model. Our results
imply that (1) a larger particle injection at the gap boundaries is more
frequent for the pulsar with a larger spin down power and (2) outer gap with an
injection rate much smaller than the Goldreich-Julian value produces observe
$>10$GeV emissions. Fermi-LAT gamma-ray pulsars show that (i) the observed
gamma-ray spectrum below cut-off energy tends to be softer for the pulsar with
a higher spin down rate and (ii) the second peak is more prominent in higher
energy bands. Based on the results of the fitting, we describe possible

intuitions arise about the best possible rate of convergence attainable by
nonparametric estimators of that copula. In the end, any such estimator must be
based on the marginal conditional distribution functions of the two dependent
variables given the covariate, and the best possible rates for estimating such
localized objects is slower than the parametric one. However, the invariance of
the conditional copula given the value of the covariate suggests the
possibility of parametric convergence rates. The more optimistic intuition is
shown to be correct, confirming a conjecture supported by extensive Monte Carlo
simulations by I. Hobaek Haff and J. Segers [Computational Statistics and Data

the double smoothing procedure employed for the estimator of the marginal

sequence, the estimator is shown to take values in a certain class of smooth
functions, the class having sufficiently small entropy for empirical process
arguments to work. The copula estimator itself is asymptotically
undistinguishable from a kind of oracle empirical copula, making it appear as

of work from a system, as well as perform the reverse formation process. Even
more surprisingly, using only these two operations and one ancilla qubit in a
thermal state, one can transform any state into any other state allowable by
the second laws. We thus have the remarkable result that the second laws hold
for fine-grained manipulation of system and bath, but can be achieved using
very coarse control. This brings the full array of thermal operations into a
regime accessible by experiment, and establishes the physical relevance of
these second laws.

the execution of an app to be shipped into one single apk file. Thus, an
analysis of Android apps often visits code which is not part of the
functionality delivered by the app. Such code is often contributed by the
common libraries which are used pervasively by all apps. Unfortunately, Android
analyses, e.g., for piggybacking detection and malware detection, can produce
inaccurate results if they do not take into account the case of library code,
which constitute noise in app features. Despite some efforts on investigating
Android libraries, the momentum of Android research has not yet produced a
complete set of common libraries to further support in-depth analysis of
Android apps. In this paper, we leverage a dataset of about 1.5 million apps
from Google Play to harvest potential common libraries, including advertisement
libraries. With several steps of refinements, we finally collect by far the
largest set of 1,113 libraries supporting common functionalities and 240
libraries for advertisement. We use the dataset to investigates several aspects
of Android libraries, including their popularity and their proportion in
Android app code. Based on these datasets, we have further performed several
empirical investigations to confirm the motivations behind our work.

are water poor. However, in the protoplanetary disk the temperature should have
decreased below water condensation level well before the disk was
photoevaporated. Thus, the global water depletion of the inner Solar System is
puzling. We show that, even if the inner disk becomes cold, there cannot be
direct condensation of water. This is because the snowline moves towards the
Sun more slowly than the gas itself. The appearance of ice in a range of
heliocentric distances swept by the snowline can only be due to the radial
drift of icy particles from the outer disk. However, if a sufficiently massive
planet is present, the radial drift of particles is interrupted, because the
disk acquires a superKeplerian rotation just outside of the planetary orbit.
From this result, we propose that the precursor of Jupiter achieved about 20
Earth masses when the snowline was still around 3 AU. This effectively
fossilized the snowline at that location. Although cooling, the disk inside of
the Jovian orbit remained ice-depleted because the flow of icy particles from
the outer system was intercepted by the planet. This scenario predicts that
planetary systems without giant planets should be much more rich in water in
their inner regions than our system. We also show that the inner edge of the
planetesimal disk at 0.7AU, required in terrestrial planet formation models to
explain the small mass of Mercury and the absence of planets inside of its
orbit, could be due to the silicate condensation line, fossilized at the end of
the phase of streaming instability that generated the planetesimal seeds. Thus,
when the disk cooled, silicate particles started to drift inwards of 0.7AU
without being sublimated, but they could not be accreted by any pre-existing
planetesimals.

on Khot's Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). In Max $k$-CSP$_R$, we are given a set
of predicates each of which depends on exactly $k$ variables. Each variable can
take any value from $1, 2, \dots, R$. The goal is to find an assignment to
variables that maximizes the number of satisfied predicates.
  Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, we show that it is NP-hard to
approximate Max $k$-CSP$_R$ to within factor $2^{O(k \log k)}(\log
R)^{k/2}/R^{k - 1}$ for any $k, R$. To the best of our knowledge, this result
improves on all the known hardness of approximation results when $3 \leq k =
o(\log R/\log \log R)$. In this case, the previous best hardness result was
NP-hardness of approximating within a factor $O(k/R^{k-2})$ by Chan. When $k =
2$, our result matches the best known UGC-hardness result of Khot, Kindler,
Mossel and O'Donnell.
  In addition, by extending an algorithm for Max 2-CSP$_R$ by Kindler, Kolla
and Trevisan, we provide an $\Omega(\log R/R^{k - 1})$-approximation algorithm
for Max $k$-CSP$_R$. This algorithm implies that our inapproximability result
is tight up to a factor of $2^{O(k \log k)}(\log R)^{k/2 - 1}$. In comparison,
when $3 \leq k$ is a constant, the previously known gap was $O(R)$, which is
significantly larger than our gap of $O(\text{polylog } R)$.
  Finally, we show that we can replace the Unique Games Conjecture assumption

directed graph G on n vertices with edge-costs, a root vertex r, a set of h
terminals T and an integer k. The goal is to find a min-cost subgraph H of G
that connects r to each terminal t by k edge-disjoint r,t-paths. This problem
includes as special cases the well-known directed Steiner tree (DST) problem
(the case k = 1) and the group Steiner tree (GST) problem. Despite having been
studied and mentioned many times in literature, e.g., by Feldman et al.
[SODA'09, JCSS'12], by Cheriyan et al. [SODA'12, TALG'14] and by Laekhanukit
[SODA'14], there was no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for k-DST for
k >= 2 even in the special case that an input graph is directed acyclic and has
a constant number of layers. If an input graph is not acyclic, the complexity
status of k-DST is not known even for a very strict special case that k= 2 and
|T| = 2.
  In this paper, we make a progress toward developing a non-trivial
approximation algorithm for k-DST. We present an O(D k^{D-1} log
n)-approximation algorithm for k-DST on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with D
layers, which can be extended to a special case of k-DST on ""general graphs""
when an instance has a D-shallow optimal solution, i.e., there exist k
edge-disjoint r,t-paths, each of length at most D, for every terminal t. For
the case k= 1 (DST), our algorithm yields an approximation ratio of O(D log h),
thus implying an O(log^3 h)-approximation algorithm for DST that runs in
quasi-polynomial-time (due to the height-reduction of Zelikovsky
[Algorithmica'97]). Consequently, as our algorithm works for general graphs, we
obtain an O(D k^{D-1} log n)-approximation algorithm for a D-shallow instance
of the k-edge-connected directed Steiner subgraph problem, where we wish to
connect every pair of terminals by k-edge-disjoint paths.

primarily as horizontal accelerations, can be modeled approximately with a
simple quasi-static point-load model of the negative pressure field associated

load imposed by a dust devil of diameter D and core pressure {\Delta}Po is
~({\pi}/2){\Delta}PoD$^2$, or for a typical terrestrial devil of 5 m diameter

square of distance, and on the elastic properties of the ground, and the large
signals we observe are in part due to the relatively soft playa sediment and
the shallow installation of the instrument. Ground tilt may be a particularly
sensitive means of detecting dust devils. The simple point-load model fails for
large dust devils at short ranges, but more elaborate models incorporating the

characterize the best recovery operation acting only on the zero-energy

to understand the effect of such restriction, we discuss two examples of noise
models acting on the topological system and compare the amount of information
that can be recovered by accessing either the whole system, or the zero-modes
only, with particular attention to the scaling with the size of the system and
the energy gap. We explicitly discuss the case of a thermal bosonic environment
inducing a parity-preserving Markovian dynamics in which the introduced memory
fidelity decays exponentially in time, independent from system size, thus
showing the impossibility to retrieve the information by acting on the

For the case of a strongly polar fluid like pure water, an electric potential
difference of a few hundreds of volts can trigger convection. Although the
analysis in this paper cannot explain the phenomenon described in [Gross &
Porter(1966)], it could be because of unavailability of accurate physical

outburst with a recurrence time of ${\sim}$1.5 yr, which is the shortest
interval of superoutbursts among WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. Early superhumps in
the superoutburst light curve were absent, and a precursor was observed at the
onset of the superoutburst for the first time in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. The
present superoutburst can be interpreted as a result of the condition that the
disk radius barely reached the 3:1 resonance radius, but did not reach the 2:1
resonance one. Ordinary superhumps immediately grew following the precursor.
The initial part of the outburst is indistinguishable from those of
superoutbursts of ordinary SU UMa-type dwarf novae. This observation supports
the interpretation that the 2:1 resonance suppresses a growth of ordinary
superhumps. The estimated superhump period and superhump period derivative are
$P_{\rm sh}$ = 0.0573185(11) d and $P_{\rm dot} = +1.5(3.1) \times 10^{-5}$,
respectively. These values indicate that the evolution of ordinary superhumps
is the same as that in past superoutbursts with much larger extent. Although
the light curve during the plateau stage was typical for an SU UMa-type dwarf
nova, this superoutburst showed a rebrightening, together with a regrowth of
the superhumps. The overall light curve of the rebrightening was the almost the
same as those observed in previous rebrightenings. This implies that the
rebrightening type is inherent in the system.

Effelsberg telescope, the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank, the Nan\c cay radio

waves are recorded and processed offline to form the coherent sum, resulting in
a tied-array telescope with an effective aperture equivalent to a 195-m

software pipeline that was designed to process the Nyquist-sampled time-series,
measure the phase and time delays between each individual telescope and a

between any two nodes in the network with a certain probability (plink).
Diffusion is the phenomenon of spreading information throughout the network,
starting from one or more initial set of nodes (called the early adopters).
Information spreads along the links with a certain probability (pdiff).
Diffusion happens in rounds with the first round involving the early adopters.
The nodes that receive the information for the first time are said to be
covered and become candidates for diffusion in the subsequent round. Diffusion
continues until all the nodes in the network have received the information
(successful diffusion) or there are no more candidate nodes to spread the
information but one or more nodes are yet to receive the information (diffusion
failure). On the basis of exhaustive simulations conducted in this paper, we
observe that for a given plink and pdiff values, the fraction of successful
diffusion attempts does not appreciably change with increase in the number of
early adopters; whereas, the average number of rounds per successful diffusion
attempt decreases with increase in the number of early adopters. The invariant
nature of the fraction of successful diffusion attempts with increase in the
number of early adopters for a random network (for fixed plink and pdiff
values) is an interesting and noteworthy observation (for further research) and
it has not been hitherto reported in the literature.

earlier detections, indicating that the source was likely in a transition to or
from a harder state. We find that the surface properties of the four magnetars
are consistent with what we have obtained using only the soft X-ray data with
STEMS3D, implying that our physically motivated magnetar emission model is a
robust tool. Based on our broadband spectral investigations, we conclude that
resonant scattering of the surface photons in the magnetosphere alone cannot
account for the hard X-ray emission in magnetars; therefore, an additional
non-thermal process, or a population of relativistic electrons is required. We
also discuss the implication of the non-detection of persistent hard X-ray
emission in 1E 1048.1-5937.

between baryons and dark matter (DM) in galaxies: the ratio of
total-to-baryonic mass at a given radius anti-correlates with the acceleration
due to baryons. The MDAR has been seen as a challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM
galaxy formation model, while it can be explained by Modified Newtonian
Dynamics. In this Letter we show that the MDAR arises in a $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology once observed galaxy scaling relations are taken into account. We
build semi-empirical models based on $\Lambda$CDM haloes, with and without the
inclusion of baryonic effects, coupled to empirically motivated structural
relations. Our models can reproduce the MDAR: specifically, a mass-dependent
density profile for DM haloes can fully account for the observed MDAR shape,
while a universal profile shows a discrepancy with the MDAR of dwarf galaxies
with $\rm M^{\star}$$<$$\rm10^{9.5}M_{\odot}$, a further indication suggesting
the existence of DM cores. Additionally, we reproduce slope and normalization
of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) with 0.17 dex scatter. These
results imply that in $\Lambda$CDM (i) the MDAR is driven by structural scaling
relations of galaxies and DM density profile shapes, and (ii) the baryonic
fractions determined by the BTFR are consistent with those inferred from
abundance-matching studies.

no deterministic polynomial-time algorithm is currently known, but has been

proposed to determine whether or not two graphs are isomorphic (i.e.,
structurally the same). In this research, we propose to use the sequence
(either the non-decreasing or nonincreasing order) of eigenvector centrality
(EVC) values of the vertices of two graphs as a precursor step to decide
whether or not to further conduct tests for graph isomorphism. The eigenvector
centrality of a vertex in a graph is a measure of the degree of the vertex as
well as the degrees of its neighbors. We hypothesize that if the non-increasing
(or non-decreasing) order of listings of the EVC values of the vertices of two
test graphs are not the same, then the two graphs are not isomorphic. If two
test graphs have an identical non-increasing order of the EVC sequence, then
they are declared to be potentially isomorphic and confirmed through additional
heuristics. We test our hypothesis on random graphs (generated according to the
Erdos-Renyi model) and we observe the hypothesis to be indeed true: graph pairs
that have the same sequence of non-increasing order of EVC values have been
confirmed to be isomorphic using the well-known Nauty software.

different contrasts depending on the acquisition parameters. Many clinical
imaging studies acquire MRI data for more than one of these contrasts---such as
for instance T1 and T2 weighted images---which makes the overall scanning
procedure very time consuming. As all of these images show the same underlying
anatomy one can try to omit unnecessary measurements by taking the similarity
into account during reconstruction. We will discuss two modifications of total
variation---based on i) location and ii) direction---that take structural a
priori knowledge into account and reduce to total variation in the degenerate
case when no structural knowledge is available. We solve the resulting convex
minimization problem with the alternating direction method of multipliers that
separates the forward operator from the prior. For both priors the
corresponding proximal operator can be implemented as an extension of the fast
gradient projection method on the dual problem for total variation. We tested
the priors on six data sets that are based on phantoms and real MRI images. In
all test cases exploiting the structural information from the other contrast
yields better results than separate reconstruction with total variation in
terms of standard metrics like peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural
similarity index. Furthermore, we found that exploiting the two dimensional
directional information results in images with well defined edges, superior to
those reconstructed solely using a priori information about the edge location.

constrain sensors in terms of calculation and communication abilities.
Designing processing algorithms at the sensor level that take into account
these constraints is an important problem in this context. We study here the
estimation of correlation functions between sensors using compressed
acquisition and one-bit-quantization. The estimation is achieved directly using
compressed samples, without considering any reconstruction of the signals. We
show that if the signals of interest are far from white noise, estimation of
the correlation using $M$ compressed samples out of $N\geq M$ can be more
advantageous than estimation of the correlation using $M$ consecutive samples.
The analysis consists of studying the asymptotic performance of the estimators
at a fixed compression rate. We provide the analysis when the compression is
realized by a random projection matrix composed of independent and identically
distributed entries. The framework includes widely used random projection
matrices, such as Gaussian and Bernoulli matrices, and it also includes very
sparse matrices. However, it does not include subsampling without replacement,
for which a separate analysis is provided. When considering
one-bit-quantization as well, the theoretical analysis is not tractable.
However, empirical evidence allows the conclusion that in practical situations,
compressed and quantized estimators behave sufficiently correctly to be useful
in, for example, time-delay estimation and model estimation.

system is reduced to an infinite sequence of 1-D systems using spherical
harmonics. Well-posedness and stability are proved in the $H^1$ space. The
resulting control and output injection gain kernels are the product of the
backstepping kernel used in control of one-dimensional reaction-diffusion
equations and a function closely related to the Poisson kernel in the $n$-ball.

latent, thereby performing representation and dynamical learning
simultaneously. To fully exploit the Bayesian nature of the RGP model we
develop the Recurrent Variational Bayes (REVARB) framework, which enables
efficient inference and strong regularization through coherent propagation of
uncertainty across the RGP layers and states. We also introduce a RGP extension
where variational parameters are greatly reduced by being reparametrized
through RNN-based sequential recognition models. We apply our model to the
tasks of nonlinear system identification and human motion modeling. The
promising obtained results indicate that our RGP model maintains its highly

viewpoint on the assessment of knowledge, and thus departs from common,
numerical evaluation. Its assessment procedures fundamentally differ from other
current ones (such as those of S.A.T. and A.C.T.). They are adaptative (taking
into account the possible correctness of previous answers from the student) and
they produce an outcome which is far more informative than a crude numerical
mark. This chapter recapitulates the main concepts underlying Knowledge Space
Theory and its special case, Learning Space Theory. We begin by describing the
combinatorial core of the theory, in the form of two basic axioms and the main
ensuing results (most of which we give without proofs). In practical
applications, learning spaces are huge combinatorial structures which may be
difficult to manage. We outline methods providing efficient and comprehensive
summaries of such large structures. We then describe the probabilistic part of
the theory, especially the Markovian type processes which are instrumental in
uncovering the knowledge states of individuals. In the guise of the ALEKS
system, which includes a teaching component, these methods have been used by
millions of students in schools and colleges, and by home schooled students. We
summarize some of the results of these applications.

wave equation for particles with spin one-half. Traditionally \`a la Dirac,
it's proposed that the ``square root'' of the Klein-Gordon (K-G) equation
involves a 4 component (Dirac) spinor and in the non-relativistic limit it can
be written as 2 equations for two 2 component spinors. On the other hand, there
exists Weyl's formalism, in which one works from the beginning with 2 component
Weyl spinors, which are the fundamental objects of the helicity formalism. In
this work we rederive Weyl's equations directly, starting from K-G equation. We
also obtain the electromagnetic interaction through minimal coupling and we get
the interaction with the magnetic moment. As an example of the use of that
formalism, we calculate Compton scattering using the helicity methods.

  and its Connection to the E8 Lattice","Paper no longer used - updated",,,,"math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an icosahedral quasicrystal as a modification of the icosagrid, a
multigrid with 10 plane sets that are arranged with icosahedral symmetry. We
use the Fibonacci chain to space the planes, thereby obtaining a quasicrystal
with icosahedral symmetry. It has a surprising correlation to the Elser-Sloane
quasicrystal, a 4D cut-and-project of the E8 lattice. We call this quasicrystal
the Fibonacci modified icosagrid quasicrystal. We found that this structure
totally embeds another quasicrystal that is a compound of 20 3D slices of the
Elser-Sloane quasicrystal. The slices, which contain only regular tetrahedra,
are put together by a certain golden ratio based rotation. Interesting
20-tetrahedron clusters arranged with the golden ratio based rotation appear
repetitively in the structure. They are arranged with icosahedral symmetry. It
turns out that this rotation is the dihedral angle of the 600-cell (the
super-cell of the Elser-Sloane quasicrystal) and the angle between the
tetrahedral facets in the E8 polytope known as the Gosset polytope.

oscillators with non-local interactions is considered. The interactions are
modeled as linear springs while the crack is presented by the absence of extra
springs. The problem is reduced to the Wiener-Hopf type and solution is
presented in terms of inverse Fourier transform. It is shown that the non-local
interactions may change the structure of the problem solution well-known from
the classical local interactions formulation. In particular, it may change the
range of the region of stable crack motion. The conclusions of the analysis are
supported by numerical results. Namely, the observed phenomenon is partially
clarified by evaluation of the structure profiles on the crack line ahead.

structure, namely cubic space group Pm3m. The superconducting transition
temperature TC=4.2 K is determined by the magnetic susceptibility, electrical
resistivity, and heat capacity measurements. The magnetization versus magnetic
field (M-H) curve at low temperatures shows the typical-II superconducting
behavior. The estimated lower and upper critical fields are about 125 Oe and
1.79 T, respectively. The penetration depth \lambda(0) and coherence length
\xi(0) are calculated to be approximately 1147 nm and 136 nm by the
Ginzburg-Landau equations. The estimated Sommerfeld coefficient of the normal
state {\gamma}_N is about 2.9 mJ/mol K2. {\Delta}C/{\gamma}NTC =1.13 and
{\lambda}ep=0.65 suggest that CaSn3 single crystal is a weakly coupled
superconductor. Electronic band structure calculations show a complex
multi-sheet Fermi surface formed by three bands and a low density of states
(DOS) at the Fermi level, which is consistent with the experimental results.
Based on the analysis of electron phonon coupling of AX3 compounds (A=Ca, La,
and Y; X=Sn and Pb), we theoretically proposed a way to increase TC in the
system.
