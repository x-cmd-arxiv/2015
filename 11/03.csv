toward the outflow-shocked region, OMC 2-FIR 4, the outflow driving source, FIR
3, and the northern outflow lobe, FIR 3N. We detected 120 lines of 20 molecular
species. The line profiles are found to be classifiable into two types: one is
a single Gaussian component with a narrow ($<$ 3 km s$^{-1}$) width and another
is two Gaussian components with narrow and wide ($>$ 3km s$^{-1}$) widths. The
narrow components for the most of the lines are detected at all positions,
suggesting that they trace the ambient dense gas. For CO, CS, HCN, and
HCO$^{+}$, the wide components are detected at all positions, suggesting the
outflow origin. The wide components of C$^{34}$S, SO, SiO, H$^{13}$CN,
HC$^{15}$N, H$_2^{13}$CO, H$_2$CS, HC$_3$N, and CH$_3$OH are detected only at
FIR 4, suggesting the outflow-shocked gas origin. The rotation diagram analysis
revealed that the narrow components of C$_2$H and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ show low
temperatures of 12.5$\pm$1.4 K, while the wide components show high
temperatures of 20--70 K. This supports our interpretation that the wide
components trace the outflow and/or outflow-shocked gas. We compared observed
molecular abundances relative to H$^{13}$CO$^+$ with those of the
outflow-shocked region, L1157 B1, and the hot corino, IRAS 16293-2422. Although
we cannot exclude a possibility that the chemical enrichment in FIR 4 is caused
by the hot core chemistry, the chemical compositions in FIR 4 are more similar
to those in L1157 B1 than those in IRAS 16293-2422.

matter make up approximately $25\%$ of the energy content of the Universe. Most
approaches to explain the microscopic nature of dark matter, to date, have
assumed its composition to be of intrinsically weakly interacting particles;
however, this need not be the case to have consistency with all extant
observations. Given decades of inconclusive evidence to support any dark matter
candidate, there is strong motivation to consider alternatives to the standard
particle scenario. One such example is macro dark matter, a class of candidates
(macros) that could interact strongly with the particles of the Standard Model,
have large masses and physical sizes, and yet behave as dark matter. Macros
that scatter completely inelastically could have altered the primordial
production of the elements, and macro charge-dependent constraints have been
obtained previously. Here we reconsider the phenomenology of inelastically
interacting macros on the abundance of primordially produced $^4\text{He}$ and
revise previous constraints by also taking into account improved measurements
of the primordial $^4\text{He}$ abundance. The constraints derived here are
limited in applicability to only leptophobic macros that have a surface
potential $V \gtrsim 0.5\,$MeV. However, an important conclusion from our
analysis is that even neutral macros would likely affect the abundance of the
light elements. Therefore, constraints on that scenario are possible and are
currently an open question.

distributing computation workload among multiple geographically dispersed data

This paper takes the first step towards tackling this important issue, by
studying how the power grid can take advantage of the data centers' load
distribution proactively for the purpose of power load balancing. We model the
interactions between power grid and data centers as a two-stage problem, where
the utility company chooses proper pricing mechanisms to balance the electric
power load in the first stage, and the data centers seek to minimize their
total energy cost by responding to the prices in the second stage. We show that
the two-stage problem is a bilevel quadratic program, which is NP-hard and
cannot be solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We introduce
benchmark problems to derive upper and lower bounds for the solution of the
two-stage problem. We further propose a branch and bound algorithm to attain
the globally optimal solution, and propose a heuristic algorithm with low
computational complexity to obtain an alternative close-to-optimal solution. We
also study the impact of background load prediction error using the theoretical
framework of robust optimization. The simulation results demonstrate that our
proposed scheme can not only improve the power grid reliability but also reduce

geometry-based models, such as hyperbolic random graphs.
  With this paper we contribute to the theoretical analysis of these modern,
more realistic random graph models. Instead of studying directly hyperbolic
random graphs, we use a generalization that we call geometric inhomogeneous
random graphs (GIRGs). Since we ignore constant factors in the edge
probabilities, GIRGs are technically simpler (specifically, we avoid hyperbolic
cosines), while preserving the qualitative behaviour of hyperbolic random
graphs, and we suggest to replace hyperbolic random graphs by this new model in
future theoretical studies.
  We prove the following fundamental structural and algorithmic results on
GIRGs. (1) As our main contribution we provide a sampling algorithm that
generates a random graph from our model in expected linear time, improving the
best-known sampling algorithm for hyperbolic random graphs by a substantial
factor O(n^0.5). (2) We establish that GIRGs have clustering coefficients in
{\Omega}(1), (3) we prove that GIRGs have small separators, i.e., it suffices
to delete a sublinear number of edges to break the giant component into two
large pieces, and (4) we show how to compress GIRGs using an expected linear

engineered optical media and surfaces have attracted great attention in the
past recent years. In this work the problem of transparency is considered for
optical wave propagation in a nonlinear dielectric medium with second-order
$\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility. Because of nonlinear interaction, a reference
signal wave at carrier frequency $\omega_1$ can exchange power, thus being
amplified or attenuated,when phase matching conditions are satisfied and
frequency conversion takes place. Therefore, rather generally the medium is not
transparent to the signal wave because of 'scattering' in the frequency domain.
Here we show that broadband transparency, corresponding to the full absence of
frequency conversion in spite of phase matching, can be observed for the signal
wave in the process of sum frequency generation whenever the effective
susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ along the nonlinear medium is tailored following a
suitable spatial apodization profile and the power level of the pump wave is
properly tuned. While broadband transparency is observed under such conditions,
the nonlinear medium is not invisible owing to an additional effective
dispersion for the signal wave introduced by the nonlinear interaction.

disruptions to the dark matter halos of the colliding galaxy clusters

dark matter halos' distributions, in the space between the colliding galaxy
clusters. This feature appears in our simulations as shells of scattered dark
matter expanding in alignment with the outgoing original galaxy clusters,
contributing significant densities to projected mass distributions at large

Our simulations indicate that as much as 20% of the total collision's mass may
be deposited into such structures without noticeable disruptions to the main

however in purely gravitational high-speed galaxy cluster collisions.
Convincing identification of such structures in real colliding galaxy clusters

for a class of spin-1/2 quantum critical XXZ chains with random coupling
constants which are partially correlated. In the XX case, distinctly from the
usual uncorrelated random case where the system is governed by an
infinite-disorder fixed point, the correlated-disorder chain is governed by
finite-disorder fixed points. Surprisingly, we verify that, although the system
is not conformally invariant, the leading behavior of the R\'enyi entanglement
entropies are similar to those of the clean (no randomness) conformally
invariant system. In addition, we compute the Shannon mutual information among
subsystems of our correlated-disorder quantum chain and verify the same leading
behavior as the $n=2$ R\'enyi entanglement entropy. This result extends a
recent conjecture concerning the same universal behavior of these quantities
for conformally invariant quantum chains. For the generic spin-1/2 quantum
critical XXZ case, the true asymptotic regime is identical to that in the
uncorrelated disorder case. However, these finite-disorder fixed points govern
the low-energy physics up to a very long crossover length scale and the same
results as in the XX case apply. Our results are based on exact numerical

from the perspective of the phase space structure of these homoclinic orbits in

enhance the noise level by several orders of magnitude compared to the noise
above a bare metal. Close to this layered surface, the power spectral density
of the electric field varies with the inverse fourth power of the distance to
the surface, rather than with the inverse square, as it would above a bare

does not vary with frequency (in the radio-wave and microwave bands), the
dielectric layer can generate electric-field noise which scales in inverse
proportion to the frequency. For various realistic scenarios, the noise levels
predicted from this model are comparable to those observed in trapped-ion

the gravitational collapse of massive stars to black holes is the transition
between a black-hole geometry and a white-hole geometry, though their proposals
are radically different in terms of their physical interpretation and
characteristic time scales [1,2]. Several decades ago, it was shown by Eardley
that white holes are highly unstable to the accretion of small amounts of
matter, being rapidly turned into black holes [3]. Studying the crossing of
null shells on geometries describing the black-hole to white-hole transition,
we obtain the conditions for the instability to develop in terms of the
parameters of these geometries. We conclude that transitions with long
characteristic time scales are pathologically unstable: occasional
perturbations away from the perfect vacuum around these compact objects, even
if being imperceptibly small, suffocate the white hole explosion. On the other
hand, geometries with short characteristic time scales are shown to be robust
against perturbations, so that the corresponding processes could take place in
real astrophysical scenarios. This motivates a conjecture about the transition
amplitudes of different decay channels for black holes in a suitable
ultraviolet completion of general relativity.

capture the extensional viscosity of entangled polymer melts from low

boundary conditions exist in all directions to enable a uniform deformation
rate throughout the simulation domain. As expected, the extensional viscosity
is four times the zero shear viscosity at low deformation rates. As the
deformation rate increases, the extensional viscosity increases, plateaus, and
then decreases. The algorithm thus correctly captures the physics of polymer
melts in extensional flow in a fully a priori manner while providing
significant computational advantages over molecular dynamics methods. Because
the technique is applicable to polydisperse systems, the ability to predict in

detected by the Kepler telescope with orbital periods up to 400 days. We first
defined a sample of 129 giant-planet candidates that we followed up with the
SOPHIE spectrograph (OHP, France) in a 6-year radial velocity campaign. This
allow us to unveil the nature of these candidates and to measure a
false-positive rate of 54.6 +/- 6.5 % for giant-planet candidates orbiting
within 400 days of period. Based on a sample of confirmed or likely planets, we
then derive the occurrence rates of giant planets in different ranges of
orbital periods. The overall occurrence rate of giant planets within 400 days
is 4.6 +/- 0.6 %. We recover, for the first time in the Kepler data, the
different populations of giant planets reported by radial velocity surveys.
Comparing these rates with other yields, we find that the occurrence rate of
giant planets is lower only for hot jupiters but not for the longer period
planets. We also derive a first measurement on the occurrence rate of brown
dwarfs in the brown-dwarf desert with a value of 0.29 +/- 0.17 %. Finally, we
discuss the physical properties of the giant planets in our sample. We confirm
that giant planets receiving a moderate irradiation are not inflated but we
find that they are in average smaller than predicted by formation and evolution
models. In this regime of low-irradiated giant planets, we find a possible
correlation between their bulk density and the Iron abundance of the host star,
which needs more detections to be confirmed.

We consider the
problem of synthesizing an optimal almost-sure winning strategy in a two-player

qualitative objective as a Rabin winning condition, and a quantitative

almost-sure winning strategies, i.e., system strategies that guarantee the
satisfaction of the Rabin condition with probability 1 regardless of the
environment's strategy. We show that optimal almost-sure winning strategies may
need infinite memory, but epsilon-optimal almost-sure winning strategies can
always be finite-memory or even memoryless. We identify a sufficient and

has the form of $\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i = (1-2p)n$, where $p \in (\Omega(1), 1 -
\Omega(1))$ and $pn$ is an integer. Let $AVG$ be the expected number of
constraints satisfied by randomly choosing an assignment to $x_1, x_2, \dots,
x_n$, complying with the global cardinality constraint. The CSP above average
with the global cardinality constraint problem asks whether there is an
assignment (complying with the cardinality constraint) that satisfies more than
$(AVG+t)$ constraints, where $t$ is an input parameter.
  In this paper, we present an algorithm that finds a valid assignment
satisfying more than $(AVG+t)$ constraints (if there exists one) in time
$(2^{O(t^2)} + n^{O(d)})$. Therefore, the CSP above average with the global

improving the cosmology constraints from recent galaxy surveys such as Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We estimate the efficiency of the
reconstruction method as a function of various reconstruction details. To
directly quantify the BAO information in nonlinear density fields before and
after reconstruction, we calculate the cross-correlations (i.e., propagators)
of the pre(post)-reconstructed density field with the initial linear field
using a mock galaxy sample that is designed to mimic the clustering of the BOSS
CMASS galaxies. The results directly provide the BAO damping as a function of
wavenumber that can be implemented into the Fisher matrix analysis. We focus on
investigating the dependence of the propagator on a choice of smoothing filters
and on two major different conventions of the redshift-space density field
reconstruction that have been used in literature. By estimating the BAO
signal-to-noise for each case, we predict constraints on the angular diameter
distance and Hubble parameter using the Fisher matrix analysis. We thus
determine an optimal Gaussian smoothing filter scale for the signal-to-noise
level of the BOSS CMASS. We also present appropriate BAO fitting models for
different reconstruction methods based on the first and second order Lagrangian
perturbation theory in Fourier space. Using the mock data, we show that the

comprise the three LGRBs with high metallicity host galaxies in the Graham &
Fruchter (2013) sample. In Graham & Fruchter (2013), we showed that LGRBs
exhibit a strong and apparently intrinsic preference for low metallicity
environments (12+log(O/H) < 8.4 in the KK04 scale) in spite of these three
cases with abundances of about solar and above. These exceptions however are
consistent with the general star-forming galaxy population of comparable
brightness & redshift. This is surprising: even among a preselected sample of
high metallicity LGRBs, were the metal aversion to remain in effect for these
objects, we would expect their metallicity to still be lower than the typical
metallicity for the galaxies at that luminosity and redshift. Therefore we
deduce that it is possible to form an LGRB in a high metallicity environment
although with greater rarity.
  From this we conclude that there are three possible explanations for the
presence of the LGRBs observed in high metallicity hosts as seen to date: (1)
LGRBs do not occur in high metallicity environments and those seen in high
metallicity hosts are in fact occurring in low metallicity environments that
have become associated with otherwise high metallicity hosts but remain
unenriched. (2) The LGRB formation mechanism while preferring low metallicity
environments does not strictly require it resulting in a gradual decline in
burst formation with increasing metallicity. (3) The typical low metallicity
LGRBs and the few high metallicity cases are the result of physically different
burst formation pathways with only the former affected by the metallicity and
the later occurring much more infrequently.

the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to optics. However, the
performance and applicability of such systems have been severely plagued by
distortions due to the frequency dependent nature of the amplitude response of
the dispersive media used for processing. This frequency dependence is a
fundamental consequence of the causality constraint, incarnated by
Kramers-Kronig relations or, equivalently, by the Bode relations. In order to
resolve this issue, we introduce here the concept of a \emph{perfect dispersive
medium}, which is a loss-gain medium characterized by a perfectly flat
magnitude response along with an arbitrary phase response. This unprecedented
property results from equalized electric and magnetic dipole dispersion
responses, whence the amplitude and phase of the transmission functions of the
isolated loss and gain contributions become the inverse and remain the same,
respectively, under reversal of the sign of the imaginary part of the equalized
magneto-dielectric polarizability. Such a perfect dispersive medium may be
realized in the form of a metamaterial, and the paper demonstrates a
corresponding stacked loss-gain metasurface structure for illustration. From a
practical standpoint, perfect dispersive media represent a paradigm shift that
may propel real-time signal processing technology to a new dimension, with a

use foreground and background galaxies as field control sample. The
cluster+field sample consists of 42 galaxies with stellar masses in the range
10^8-10^11 M_sun, and star formation rates in the range 1-20 M_sun/yr. Both in
clusters and in the field, H{\alpha} is more extended than the rest-frame UV
continuum in 60% of the cases, consistent with diffuse star formation and
inside out growth. In ~20% of the cases, the H{\alpha} emission appears more
extended in cluster galaxies than in the field, pointing perhaps to ionized gas
being stripped and/or star formation being enhanced at large radii. The peak of
the H{\alpha} emission and that of the continuum are offset by less than 1 kpc.

and with the surface mass density as inferred from gravitational lens models
and find no conclusive results. The diversity of morphologies and sizes
observed in H_alpha illustrates the complexity of the environmental process
that regulate star formation. Upcoming analysis of the full GLASS dataset will
increase our sample size by almost an order of magnitude, verifying and
strengthening the inference from this initial dataset.

increase with stellar mass, driving an increase in the OVI column density

Observed OVI column density profiles exhibit a weaker mass dependence than

additional heating of the abundant cool gas in low-mass halos, or with
increased numerical resolution capturing turbulent/conductive mixing layers

star-forming galaxies of the same mass, in qualitative agreement with the

quenches galaxies by heating the CGM and ejecting significant amounts of gas
from the halo. Finally, we find that the inclusion of the central galaxy's

constrain the behavior of $dN/dS$ below the source detection threshold. Overall
the source count distribution is constrained over three decades in flux and
found compatible with a broken power law with a break flux, $S_b$, in the range
$[8 \times 10^{-12},1.5 \times 10^{-11}]$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and power-law

consistent with a single population (i.e. blazars) dominating the source counts

being fed by a large-scale (L > 35 kpc) accretion stream. Archival HST images
show small scale (~5 kpc) tentacular filaments converging near a hot-spot of
star-formation, possibly fueled by gas falling in along the filaments. The
spectral energy distribution of the tentacles is broadly compatible with either
(1) non-ionizing rest-frame far-UV continuum emission from stars formed in an
60 million-year-old starburst; (2) nebular 2-photon-continuum radiation,
arising from collisional excitation cooling, or (3) a recombination spectrum
emitted by hydrogen fluorescing in response to ionizing radiation escaping from
the galaxy. The latter possibility simultaneously accounts for the presence of
asymmetric Lyman alpha emission from the large-scale gaseous filament and the
nebular continuum in the smaller-scale tentacles as caused by the escape of
ionizing radiation from the galaxy. Possible astrophysical explanations for the
nature of the tentacles include: a galactic wind powered by the starburst;
in-falling gas during cold accretion, or tails of interstellar medium dragged
out of the galaxy by satellite halos that have plunged through the main halo.
The possibility of detecting extragalactic 2-photon continuum emission in
space-based, broad-band images suggests a tool for studying the gaseous
environment of high redshift galaxies at much greater spatial detail than

a self-gravitating, collisional N-body system with ~10^6 particles over many
relaxation times, remains a major challenge in computational astrophysics.
Unfortunately, current techniques to model such systems suffer from severe
limitations. A direct N-body simulation with more than 10^5 particles can
require months or even years to complete, while an orbit-sampling Monte Carlo
approach cannot adequately model the dynamics in a dense cluster core,
particularly in the presence of many black holes. We have developed a new
technique combining the precision of a direct N-body integration with the speed
of a Monte Carlo approach. Our Rapid And Precisely Integrated Dynamics code,
the RAPID code, statistically models interactions between neighboring stars and
stellar binaries while integrating directly the orbits of stars or black holes
in the cluster core. This allows us to accurately simulate the dynamics of the
black holes in a realistic globular cluster environment without the burdensome
N^2 scaling of a full N-body integration. We compare RAPID models of idealized
globular clusters to identical models from the direct N-body and Monte Carlo
methods. Our tests show that RAPID can reproduce the half-mass radii, core
radii, black hole ejection rates, and binary properties of the direct N-body
models far more accurately than a standard Monte Carlo integration while
remaining significantly faster than a full N-body integration. With this
technique, it will be possible to create more realistic models of Milky Way
globular clusters with sufficient rapidity to explore the full parameter space
of dense stellar clusters.

is seen as a critical component in creating an environment in which a direct
collapse black hole may form. Employing radiative transfer we model the effect
of multi-frequency (0.76 eV - 60 eV) radiation on a collapsing halo at high
redshift. We vary both the shape of the spectrum which emits the radiation and
the distance to the emitting galaxy. We use blackbody spectra with temperatures
of $\rm{T = 10^4\ K}$ and $\rm{T = 10^5\ K}$ and a realistic stellar spectrum.
We find that an optimal zone exists between 1 kpc and 4 kpc from the emitting
galaxy. If the halo resides too close to the emitting galaxy the photo-ionising
radiation creates a large HII region which effectively disrupts the collapsing
halo, too far from the source and the radiation flux drops below the level of
the expected background and the H$_2$ fraction remains too high. When the
emitting galaxy is initially placed between 1 kpc and 2 kpc from the collapsing
halo, with a spectral shape consistent with a star-forming high redshift
galaxy, then a large central core forms. The mass of the central core is
between 5000 and 10000 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ at a temperature of approximately 1000
K. This core is however surrounded by a reservoir of hotter gas at
approximately 8000 K which leads to mass inflow rates of the order of $\sim
0.1$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ yr$^{-1}$. This environment has the potential to form a
massive primordial star which can then lead to the formation of a direct
collapse black hole.

could play a key role in the chemistry of molecules relevant to abiogenesis
(prebiotic chemistry). In this work, we explore the impact of UV light on
prebiotic chemistry that might occur in liquid water on the surface of a planet
with an atmosphere. We consider effects including atmospheric absorption,
attenuation by water, and stellar variability to constrain the UV input as a
function of wavelength. We conclude that the UV environment would be
characterized by broadband input, and wavelengths below 204 nm and 168 nm would
be shielded out by atmospheric CO2 and water, respectively. We compare this
broadband prebiotic UV input to the narrowband UV sources (e.g. mercury lamps)
often used in laboratory studies of prebiotic chemistry, and explore the
implications for the conclusions drawn from these experiments. We consider as
case studies the ribonucleotide synthesis pathway of Powner et al (2009) and
the sugar synthesis pathway of Ritson et al (2012). Irradiation by narrowband
UV light from a mercury lamp formed an integral component of these studies: we
quantitatively explore the impact of more realistic UV input on the conclusions
that can be drawn from these experiments. Finally, we explore the constraints
solar UV input places on the buildup of prebiotically important feedstock
gasses like CH4 and HCN. Our results demonstrate the importance of
characterizing the wavelength dependence (action spectra) of prebiotic

distances of the original graph. It is well known that there is a smooth
tradeoff between the sparsity of a spanner and the quality of its
approximation, so long as distance error is measured multiplicatively. A
central open question in the field is to prove or disprove whether such a
tradeoff exists also in the regime of \emph{additive} error. That is, is it
true that for all $\varepsilon>0$, there is a constant $k_{\varepsilon}$ such
that every graph has a spanner on $O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$ edges that preserves
its pairwise distances up to $+k_{\varepsilon}$? Previous lower bounds are
consistent with a positive resolution to this question, while previous upper
bounds exhibit the beginning of a tradeoff curve: all graphs have $+2$ spanners
on $O(n^{3/2})$ edges, $+4$ spanners on $\tilde{O}(n^{7/5})$ edges, and $+6$
spanners on $O(n^{4/3})$ edges. However, progress has mysteriously halted at
the $n^{4/3}$ bound, and despite significant effort from the community, the
question has remained open for all $0 < \varepsilon < 1/3$.
  Our main result is a surprising negative resolution of the open question,
even in a highly generalized setting. We show a new information theoretic
incompressibility bound: there is no function that compresses graphs into
$O(n^{4/3 - \varepsilon})$ bits so that distance information can be recovered
within $+n^{o(1)}$ error. As a special case of our theorem, we get a tight
lower bound on the sparsity of additive spanners: the $+6$ spanner on
$O(n^{4/3})$ edges cannot be improved in the exponent, even if any
subpolynomial amount of additive error is allowed. Our theorem implies new
lower bounds for related objects as well; for example, the twenty-year-old $+4$
emulator on $O(n^{4/3})$ edges also cannot be improved in the exponent unless
the error allowance is polynomial.

accurately captures the overall scientific impact of researchers at all career

quality over quantity. Third, our approach captures the time-evolution of the

such as electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. There
have been a good number of successful proposals for sparse precision matrix
estimation under normal or matrix normal distribution; however, this family of

estimated links. In this article, we adopt a matrix normal distribution
framework and formulate the brain connectivity analysis as a precision matrix
hypothesis testing problem. Based on the separable spatial-temporal dependence
structure, we develop oracle and data-driven procedures to test the global
hypothesis that all spatial locations are conditionally independent, which are
shown to be particularly powerful against the sparse alternatives. In addition,
simultaneous tests for identifying conditional dependent spatial locations with
false discovery rate control are proposed in both oracle and data-driven
settings. Theoretical results show that the data-driven procedures perform
asymptotically as well as the oracle procedures and enjoy certain optimality
properties. The empirical finite-sample performance of the proposed tests is
studied via simulations, and the new tests are applied on a real

Existing classification methods are designed to classify unknown instances

the form of a prediction within a closed-set of classes. However, a more

possibility of encountering instances that do not belong to any of the training

class of the training set, Galaxy-X creates a minimum bounding hyper-sphere

adequately evaluate open-set classification, we introduce a novel evaluation

prove that the contribution from the nonunital part of any noise map is at most

any coherent contribution. We also show that the ""average"" error rate when
measurements are not restricted to an eigenbasis containing the state of the

no-go results such as Bell inequalities, an assumption of measurement
independence is crucial. It is a surprisingly strong assumption -- less than
1/15 bits of prior correlation suffice for a local model of the singlet state
of two qubits -- with ramifications for the security of quantum communication
protocols. Indeed, without this assumption, any statistical correlations
whatsoever -- even those which appear to allow explicit superluminal signalling
-- have a corresponding local deterministic model. It is argued that 'quantum
nonlocality' is bad terminology, and that measurement independence does not
equate to 'experimental free will'. Brans' 1988 model is extended to show that

molecular mechanisms of life. The number of publicly available protein
structures has increasingly become extremely large. Still, the determination of
the function of a protein structure remains a difficult, costly, and time
consuming task. The difficulties are often due to the essential role of spatial
and topological structures in the determination of protein functions in living
cells. In this paper, we propose ProtNN, a novel approach for protein function
prediction. Given an unannotated protein structure and a set of annotated
proteins, ProtNN finds the nearest neighbor annotated structures based on
protein-graph pairwise similarities. Given a query protein, ProtNN finds the
nearest neighbor reference proteins based on a graph representation model and a
pairwise similarity between vector embedding of both query and reference
protein-graphs in structural and topological spaces. ProtNN assigns to the
query protein the function with the highest number of votes across the set of k

parameters of independently-actuated optical fibers in multi-object
astronomical fiber positioning systems. This work comes from the development of
a new type of piezoelectric motor intended to enhance the 'tilting spine' fiber
positioning technology originally created by the Australian Astronomical
Observatory. Testing has shown that the motor's performance can vary depending
on the fiber's location within its accessible field, meaning that an individual
fiber is difficult calibrate with a one-time routine. Better performance has
resulted from constantly updating calibration parameters based on the observed
movements of the fiber during normal closed-loop positioning. Over time,
location-specific historical data is amassed that can be used to better predict
the results of a future fiber movement. This is similar to a technique
previously proposed by the Australian Astronomical Observatory, but with the
addition of location-specific learning. Results from a prototype system are
presented, showing a significant reduction in overall positioning error when
using this new approach.

spoofing is a popular strategy and is considered illegal by market regulators.
Some promising tools have been developed to detect manipulation, but cases can

trading, two strategies that differ in the legal background but share the same
elemental concept of market manipulation. We use a reinforcement learning
framework within the full and partial observability of Markov decision

the causes of what encourages the traders to perform fraudulent activities.

Lieb-Liniger interaction parameter $\gamma$ passing through the Sine-Gordon

results between those due to an irrational ratio $\lambda_1/\lambda_2$ and due
to a rational approximation of the latter. For a weak bichromatic optical
lattice, it is chiefly demonstrated that this transition is robust against the
introduction of quasidisorder via a weaker, secondary, and incommensurate
optical lattice superimposed on the primary one. The properties, such as the
correlation function, Matsubara Green's function, and the single-particle
density matrix, do not respond to changes in the depth of the secondary optical
lattice $V_1$. For a stronger bichromatic optical lattice, however, a response
is observed because of changes in $V_1$. It is found accordingly, that holes in
the SG regime play an important role in the response of properties to changes
in $\gamma$. The continuous-space worm algorithm Monte Carlo method [Boninsegni

model, in which a single firm offers products and has consumers with
heterogeneous preferences. Consumer trials are influenced by past purchases and
the ranking of each product. The platform owner needs to devise a ranking
policy to display the products to maximize the number of purchases in the long
run. The model proposed attempts to understand the impact of market
segmentation in a trial-offer market with social influence. In our model,
consumer choices are based on a very general choice model known as the mixed
MNL. We analyze the long-term dynamics of this highly complex stochastic model
and we quantify the expected benefits of market segmentation. When past
purchases are displayed, consumer heterogeneity makes buyers try the
sub-optimal products, reducing the overall sales rate. We show that consumer
heterogeneity makes the ranking problem NP-hard. We then analyze the benefits
of market segmentation. We find tight bounds to the expected benefits of
offering a distinct ranking to each consumer segment. Finally, we show that the
market segmentation strategy always benefits from social influence when the
average quality ranking is used. One of the managerial implications is that the
firm is better off using an aggregate ranking policy when the variety of
consumer preference is limited, but it should perform a market segmentation
policy when consumers are highly heterogeneous. We also show that this result
is robust to relatively small consumer classification mistakes; when these are
large, an aggregate ranking is preferred.

the leading candidates to interpret short duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs).
Under the assumptions that SGRBs are produced by double neutron star mergers
and that the X-ray plateau followed by a steep decay as observed in SGRB X-ray
light curves marks the collapse of a supra-massive neutron star to a black hole
(BH), we use the statistical observational properties of {\em Swift} SGRBs and
the mass distribution of Galactic double neutron star systems to place
constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and the properties of
the post-merger product. We show that current observations already put
following interesting constraints: 1) A neutron star EoS with a maximum mass
close to a parameterization of $M_{\rm max} = 2.37\,M_\odot
(1+1.58\times10^{-10} P^{-2.84})$ is favored; 2) The fractions for the several
outcomes of NS-NS mergers are as follows: $\sim40\%$ prompt BHs, $\sim30\%$
supra-massive NSs that collapse to BHs in a range of delay time scales, and
$\sim30\%$ stable NSs that never collapse; 3) The initial spin of the newly
born supra-massive NSs should be near the breakup limit ($P_i\sim1 {\rm ms}$),
which is consistent with the merger scenario; 4) The surface magnetic field of
the merger products is typically $\sim 10^{15}$ G; 5) The ellipticity of the
supra-massive NSs is $\epsilon \sim (0.004 - 0.007)$, so that strong GW
radiation is released post the merger; 6) Even though the initial spin energy
of the merger product is similar, the final energy output of the merger product
that goes into the electromagnetic channel varies in a wide range from several
$10^{49}$ erg to several $10^{52}$ erg, since a good fraction of spin energy is
either released in the form of GW or falls into the black hole as the
supra-massive NS collapses.

quantum systems based on the Brillouin-Wigner (BW) perturbation theory, which
generates an effective Hamiltonian on the projected zero-photon subspace in the
Floquet theory, reproducing the quasienergies and eigenstates of the original
Floquet Hamiltonian up to desired order in $1/\omega$, with $\omega$ being the
frequency of the drive. The advantage of the BW method is that it is not only
efficient in deriving higher-order terms, but even enables us to write down the
whole infinite series expansion, as compared to the van Vleck degenerate
perturbation theory. The expansion is also free from a spurious dependence on
the driving phase, which has been an obstacle in the Floquet-Magnus expansion.
We apply the BW expansion to various models of noninteracting electrons driven
by circularly polarized light. As the amplitude of the light is increased, the
system undergoes a series of Floquet topological-to-topological phase
transitions, whose phase boundary in the high-frequency regime is well
explained by the BW expansion. As the frequency is lowered, the high-frequency
expansion breaks down at some point due to band touching with nonzero-photon
sectors, where we find numerically even more intricate and richer Floquet
topological phases spring out. We have then analyzed, with the Floquet
dynamical mean-field theory, the effects of electron-electron interaction and
energy dissipation. We have specifically revealed that phase transitions from
Floquet-topological to Mott insulators emerge, where the phase boundaries can
again be captured with the high-frequency expansion.

described by the Euler-Poission system in moving bounded simply connected

moving at constant velocity. We show that for smooth data which are small
perturbations of size $\epsilon$ of these static states, measured in
appropriate Sobolev spaces, the solution exists and remains of size $\epsilon$

to regularization, but are often computationally intensive. Conjugate priors
ease computational demands, but the conjugate Diaconis-Ylvisaker priors for the

Kullback-Leibler divergence between the exact posterior and the optimal

showed that the Gini coefficient is a Lyapunov functional for this model,
tending to one in the time-asymptotic limit, corresponding to maximal
inequality. When a one-parameter model of redistribution is introduced, we
showed that the model admits a steady state similar to Pareto's Law.
  In this work, we analyze the form of this distribution in greater detail,
both analytically and numerically. We find that, while Pareto's Law is
approximately valid for low redistribution, it gives way to something like
Gibrat's Law at higher redistribution. We also prove that, while this Pareto or
Gibrat behavior persists over many orders of magnitude, it ultimately gives way
to gaussian decay at extremely large wealth.
  Following the work of Moukarzel et al., we introduce a bias in favor of the
wealthier agent. We derive the corresponding modification to the Fokker-Planck
equation, and we show this leads to wealth condensation when the bias exceeds a
critical value. Earlier work took the bias to be a discontinuous function of
the wealth differential between the two transacting agents, and reported a
first-order phase transition to absolute oligarchy. By contrast, in this work
we take the bias to be a continuous function of the wealth differential, and
consequently we observe a second-order phase transition with a region of
coexistence between the oligarch and a distribution of non-oligarchs.
  We additionally show that the onset of wealth condensation has a reciprocal
effect on the character of the non-oligarchical part of the distribution.
Specifically, we show that the above-mentioned gaussian decay at extremely
large wealth is valid both above and below criticality, but degenerates to
exponential decay precisely at criticality.

invariant cycles; as $\lambda$ ranges over all partitions, these spaces
collectively contain all the information about the dot action on a regular

our case the surjections are actually isomorphisms, thus reducing the
Shareshian-Wachs conjecture to computing the cohomology of a regular Hessenberg

the complex error function resulting in an efficient rational approximation.
Specifically, the computational test shows that with only $17$ summation terms
the obtained rational approximation of the complex error function provides the
average accuracy ${10^{ - 15}}$ over the most domain of practical importance $0
\le x \le 40,000$ and ${10^{ - 4}} \le y \le {10^2}$ required for the
HITRAN-based spectroscopic applications. Since the rational approximation does
not contain trigonometric or exponential functions dependent upon the input
parameters $x$ and $y$, it is rapid in computation. Such an example
demonstrates that the considered methodology of the Fourier transform may be
advantageous in practical applications.

intersection's capacity is only a fraction of the flows that the roads
connecting to the intersection can carry. This capacity can be increased if
vehicles can cross the intersections in platoons rather than one by one as they
do today. Platoon formation is enabled by connected vehicle technology. This
paper assesses the potential mobility benefits of platooning. It argues that
saturation flow rates, and hence intersection capacity, can be doubled or
tripled by platooning. The argument is supported by the analysis of three
queuing models and by the simulation of a road network with 16 intersections
and 73 links. The queuing analysis and the simulations reveal that a signalized
network with fixed time control will support an increase in demand by a factor
of (say) two or three if all saturation flows are increased by the same factor,
with no change in the control. Furthermore, despite the increased demand
vehicles will experience the same delay and travel time. The same scaling
improvement is achieved when the fixed time control is replaced by the max
pressure adaptive control. Part of the capacity increase can alternatively be
used to reduce queue lengths and the associated queuing delay by decreasing the
cycle time. Impediments to the control of connected vehicles to achieve
platooning at intersections appear to be small.

orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) signals, transmitted through
frequency selective Rayleigh (the magnitude of each channel tap is Rayleigh
distributed) fading channels having a uniform power delay profile. The channel
output is further distorted by a carrier frequency and phase offset, besides
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). A new frame structure for OFDM,
consisting of a known preamble, cyclic prefix, data and known postamble is
proposed, which has a higher throughput compared to the earlier work. A robust
turbo decoder is proposed, which functions effectively over a wide range of
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The key contribution to the good performance of
the practical coherent receiver is due to the use of a long preamble (512 QPSK
symbols), which is perhaps not specified in any of the current wireless
communication standards. We have also shown from computer simulations that, it
is possible to obtain even better BER performance, using a better code. A
simple and approximate Cramer-Rao bound on the variance of the frequency offset
estimation error for coherent detection, is derived. The proposed algorithms
are well suited for implementation on a DSP-platform.

approach to achieving polynomial-time algorithms for seemingly intractable
counting problems via a reduction to counting planar perfect matchings and a
linear change of basis. Two fundamental parameters in holographic algorithms
are the \emph{domain size} and the \emph{basis size}. Roughly, the domain size
is the range of colors involved in the counting problem at hand (e.g. counting
graph $k$-colorings is a problem over domain size $k$), while the basis size
$\ell$ captures the dimensionality of the representation of those colors. A
major open problem has been: for a given $k$, what is the smallest $\ell$ for
which any holographic algorithm for a problem over domain size $k$ ""collapses
to"" (can be simulated by) a holographic algorithm with basis size $\ell$? Cai
and Lu showed in 2008 that over domain size 2, basis size 1 suffices, opening
the door to an extensive line of work on the structural theory of holographic
algorithms over the Boolean domain. Cai and Fu later showed for signatures of
full rank that over domain sizes 3 and 4, basis sizes 1 and 2, respectively,
suffice, and they conjectured that over domain size $k$ there is a collapse to
basis size $\lfloor\log_2 k\rfloor$. In this work, we resolve this conjecture
in the affirmative for signatures of full rank for all $k$.

spectrum range. These limitations are partially due to the technological
limitations from array sensors (CCD or CMOS), and also caused by separative
measurement of the entries/slices of a spatial-spectral data cube. Besides,
they are mostly expensive and bulky. To address above issues, this paper
proposes to image the 3D multispectral data with a single bucket detector in a
multiplexing way. Under the single pixel imaging scheme, we project
spatial-spectral modulated illumination onto the target scene to encode the
scene's 3D information into a 1D measurement sequence. Conventional spatial
modulation is used to resolve the scene's spatial information. To avoid
increasing requisite acquisition time for 2D to 3D extension of the latent
data, we conduct spectral modulation in a frequency-division multiplexing
manner in the speed gap between slow spatial light modulation and fast detector
response. Then the sequential reconstruction falls into a simple Fourier
decomposition and standard compressive sensing problem. A proof-of-concept
setup is built to capture the multispectral data (64 pixels $\times$ 64 pixels
$\times$ 10 wavelength bands) in the visible wavelength range (450nm-650nm)
with acquisition time being 1 minute. The imaging scheme is of high flexibility
for different spectrum ranges and resolutions. It holds great potentials for
various low light and airborne applications, and can be easily manufactured
production-volume portable multispectral imagers.

towards its desired D2D receiver, which uses only a single antenna for
reception. While beamforming at the D2D Tx reduces D2D interference to the
neighbouring cellular UEs (CUEs), the cellular-to-D2D interference is also
negligible due to highly directional beamforming at the massive MIMO base
station. For the above proposed system, we analyze the average per-user
spectral efficiency (SE) of CUEs ($R^{c,d}$) as a function of the D2D area
spectral efficiency (ASE). Our analysis reveals that for a fixed D2D ASE

of D2D Txs ($\lambda$), $R^{c,d}$ increases (for sufficiently large $\lambda$)
and approaches a fundamental limit $R_{\infty}^{c,d}$ as $\lambda \to \infty$.
Also, $R_{\infty}^{c,d}$ depends on $R_{0}^{(d)}$ and $N$, only through the
ratio $\frac{R_{0}^{(d)}}{N-1}$, i.e, for a given fundamental limit
$R_{\infty}^{c,d}$, the D2D ASE can be approximately doubled with every

the distance traversed from start to goal, but many mobile robot applications
call for additional path planning objectives, presenting a multiobjective

However, there is a degeneracy between the dark matter and stellar components

as the length of the armchair edges becomes large in comparison to that of the

armchair ribbon with a pseudogap. In such systems a zigzag edge acts like a
domain wall, through which the polarization changes from $0$ to $e/2$, forming
a fractional charge of one-half. When the lengths of the zigzag edges and the
armchair edges are comparable a rectangular graphene sheet (RGS) is realized,
which also possess particle-hole symmetry. We show that it is a $(0+1)$
Chern-Simons topological insulator. We find that the cyclic Berry phase of
states of a RGS is quantized as $\pi$ or $0$ (mod $2\pi$), and that the Berry
phases of the particle-hole conjugate states are equal each other. By applying
the Atiyah-Singer index theorem to a rectangular ribbon and a RGS we find that
the lower bound on the number of nearly zero energy end states is approximately
proportional to the length of the zigzag edges. However, there is a correction
to this index theorem due to the effects beyond the effective mass
approximation.

to the molecular scale since it can be gated electrostatically. Gating can be
used to control the doping and the energy level alignment in the nanojunction,
thereby influencing its conductance. Here we investigate the impact of
electrostatic gating in nanojunctions between graphene electrodes operating at
finite bias. Using first principles quantum transport simulations, we show that
the voltage drop across \emph{symmetric} junctions changes dramatically and
controllably in gated systems compared to non-gated junctions. In particular,
for \emph{p}-type(\emph{n}-type) carriers the voltage drop is located close to
the electrode with positive(negative) polarity, i.e. the potential of the
junction is pinned to the negative(positive) electrode. We trace this behaviour
back to the vanishing density of states of graphene in the proximity of the
Dirac point. Due to the electrostatic gating, each electrode exposes different
density of states in the bias window between the two different electrode Fermi
energies, thereby leading to a non-symmetry in the voltage drop across the
device. This selective pinning is found to be independent of device length when
carriers are induced either by the gate or dopant atoms, indicating a general
effect for electronic circuitry based on graphene electrodes. We envision this
could be used to control the spatial distribution of Joule heating in graphene
nanostructures, and possibly the chemical reaction rate around high potential

  Eds. T. Gaisser & A. Karle (World Scientific)",,,,"astro-ph.HE hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The IceCube collaboration reports a detection of extra-terrestrial neutrinos.
The isotropy and flavor content of the signal, and the coincidence, within
current uncertainties, of the 50 TeV to 2 PeV flux and the spectrum with the
Waxman-Bahcall bound, suggest a cosmological origin of the neutrinos, related
to the sources of ultra-high energy, $>10^{10}$ GeV, cosmic-rays (UHECR). The
most natural explanation of the UHECR and neutrino signals is that both are
produced by the same population of cosmological sources, producing CRs (likely
protons) at a similar rate, $E^2d\dot{n}/dE\propto E^{0}$, over the [$1$
PeV,$10^{11}$ GeV] energy range, and residing in ""calorimetric"" environments,
like galaxies with high star formation rate, in which $E/Z<100$ PeV CRs lose
much of their energy to pion production. A tenfold increase in the effective
mass of the detector at $\gtrsim100$ TeV is required in order to significantly
improve the accuracy of current measurements, to enable the detection of a few
bright nearby starburst ""calorimeters"", and to open the possibility of
identifying the CR sources embedded within the calorimeters, by associating
neutrinos with photons accompanying transient events responsible for their
generation. Source identification and a large neutrino sample may enable one to
use astrophysical neutrinos to constrain new physics models.

interactions between atoms excited to Rydberg levels. Here, we investigate an
alternative approach, in which atomic interactions arise via their common
coupling to photonic crystal waveguides. This technique takes advantage of the
ability to separately tailor the strength and range of interactions via the
dispersion engineering of the structure itself, which can lead to qualitatively
new types of phenomena. As an example, we discuss the formation of correlated
transparency windows, in which photonic states of a certain number and shape
selectively propagate through the system. Through this technique, we show in

$0.3<M/M_\odot<0.8$. We derive the cluster's Luminosity Function in several
radial regions, from the center of the cluster out to the tidal radius. After
corrections for incompleteness and field-contamination, this has been compared
to theoretical Luminosity Functions, obtained by multiplying a simple power law
Mass Function in the form dN/dm$ \propto m^{\alpha}$ by the derivative of the
mass-luminosity relationship of the best-fit isochrone. We find that $\alpha$
varies from -0.6 in the core region to -1.9 in the outer region. This fact
allows us to observationally prove that the stars in NGC 5466 have experienced
the effects of mass segregation. We compare the radial variation of $\alpha$
from the center out to 5 core radii (r$_c$) in NGC 5466 and the globular
cluster M10, finding that the gradient of $\alpha$ in the first 5r$_c$ is more
than a factor of 2 shallower in NGC 5466 than in M10, in line with the
differences in the clusters' relaxation timescales. NGC 5466 is dynamically
younger than M10, with two-body relaxation processes only recently starting to
shape the distribution of main sequence stars. This result fully agrees with

fragmentation of molecular clouds, which in turn leads to star cluster
formation. Over time, clusters dissolve or are destroyed by interactions with
molecular clouds or tidal stripping, and their members become part of the
general field population. Star clusters are thus among the basic building
blocks of galaxies. In turn, star cluster populations, from young associations
and open clusters to old globulars, are powerful tracers of the formation,
assembly, and evolutionary history of their parent galaxies. Although their
importance had been recognised for decades, major progress in this area has
only become possible in recent years, both for Galactic and extragalactic
cluster populations. Star clusters are the observational foundation for stellar
astrophysics and evolution, provide essential tracers of galactic structure,
and are unique stellar dynamical environments. Star formation, stellar
structure, stellar evolution, and stellar nucleosynthesis continue to benefit
and improve tremendously from the study of these systems. Additionally,
fundamental quantities such as the initial mass function can be successfully
derived from modelling either the H-R diagrams or the integrated velocity
structures of, respectively, resolved and unresolved clusters and cluster
populations. Star cluster studies thus span the fields of Galactic and

end-functionalized semiflexible polymer suspensions under flow are investigated
by mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations. The hybrid simulation approach combines
the multiparticle collision dynamics method for the fluid, which accounts for
hydrodynamic interactions, with molecular dynamics simulations for the
semiflexible polymers. In equilibrium, various kinds of scaffold-like network
structures are observed, depending on polymer flexibility and end-attraction
strength. We investigate the flow behavior of the polymer networks under shear
and analyze their nonequilibrium structural and rheological properties. The
scaffold structure breaks up and densified aggregates are formed at low shear
rates, while the structural integrity is completely lost at high shear rates.
We provide a detailed analysis of the shear-rate-dependent flow-induced
structures. The studies provide a deeper understanding of the formation and
deformation of network structures in complex materials.

approximations of entrywise functions performed on a matrix that is generated
by the outer product of two vectors given as a stream. In other works, streams
typically define matrices in a standard way via a sequence of updates, as in
the work of Woodruff (2014) and others. We describe the matrix formed by the
outer product, and other matrices that do not fall into this category, as
implicit matrices. As such, we consider the general problem of computing over
such implicit matrices with Hadamard functions, which are functions applied
entrywise on a matrix. In this paper, we apply this generalization to provide
new techniques for identifying independence between two vectors in the
streaming model. The previous state of the art algorithm of Braverman and
Ostrovsky (2010) gave a $(1 \pm \epsilon)$-approximation for the $L_1$ distance
between the product and joint distributions, using space $O(\log^{1024}(nm)
\epsilon^{-1024})$, where $m$ is the length of the stream and $n$ denotes the
size of the universe from which stream elements are drawn. Our general
techniques include the $L_1$ distance as a special case, and we give an
improved space bound of $O(\log^{12}(n) \log^{2}({nm \over
\epsilon})\epsilon^{-7})$.

Telescope as an example of such a facility. We propose science cases and
provide quantitative estimates for each case. The largest advantage of
ground-based THz telescopes is their higher angular resolution (~ 4 arcsec for
a 10-m dish), as compared to space or airborne THz telescopes. Thus,
high-resolution mapping is an important scientific argument. In particular, we
can isolate zones of interest for Galactic and extragalactic star-forming
regions. The THz windows are suitable for observations of high-excitation CO
lines and [N II] 205 um lines, which are scientifically relevant tracers of
star formation and stellar feedback. Those lines are the brightest lines in the
THz windows, so that they are suitable for the initiation of ground-based THz
observations. THz polarization of star-forming regions can also be explored
since it traces the dust population contributing to the THz spectral peak. For
survey-type observations, we focus on ``sub-THz'' extragalactic surveys, whose
uniqueness is to detect galaxies at redshifts z ~ 1--2, where the dust emission
per comoving volume is the largest in the history of the Universe. Finally we
explore possibilities of flexible time scheduling, which enables us to monitor
active galactic nuclei, and to target gamma-ray burst afterglows. For these
objects, THz and submillimeter wavelength ranges have not yet been explored.

  We will briefly explain and discuss some basic techniques, for a better focus
applied to design a dedicated data compression system basing on a sample data
from a prototype of a tracking detector: 10000 events for 48 channels. We will
focus on the time data here, which after neglecting the headers and applying
data filtering, requires on average 1170 bits/event using the current coding.
Encoding relative times (differences) and grouping data by channels, reduces
this number to 798 bits/channel, still using fixed length coding: a fixed
number of bits used for a given value. Using variable length Huffman coding to
encode numbers of digital pulses for a channel and the most significant bits of
values (simple binning) reduces further this number to 552 bits/event. Using
adaptive binning: denser for frequent values, and an accurate entropy coder we
get further down to 455 bits/event - this option can easily fit unused
resources of FPGA currently used for data acquisition. Finally, using separate
probability distributions for different channels, what could be done by a
software compressor, leads to 437bits/event, what is 2.67 times less than the
original 1170 bits/event.

due to a near-resonance between a normal mode frequency of the metric and the

agents themselves instead of a global scheduler determine whom to call. In
dynamic gossip not only secrets are exchanged but also telephone numbers (agent
identities). This results in increased graph connectivity. We define six such
distributed dynamic gossip protocols, and we characterize them in terms of the
topology of the graphs on which they are successful, wherein we distinguish
strong success (the protocol always terminates, possibly assuming fair
scheduling) from weak success (the protocol sometimes terminates). For five of
these protocols strong (fair) and weak success are characterized by weakly
connected graphs. This result is surprising because the protocols are fairly
different. In the sixth protocol an agent may only call another agent if it
does not know the other agent's secret. Strong success for this protocol is
characterized by graphs for which the set of non-terminal nodes is strongly
connected. Weak success for this protocol is characterized by weakly connected
graphs satisfying further topological constraints that we define in the paper.

are discussed. It is shown that for low-frequency processes, ions and neutrals
should be treated as a single fluid with some effective charge on all of them.
We have derived a new momentum equation which should be used in such an
environment. As a result, the low-frequency magnetic waves can propagate even
if particles are not magnetized, which is entirely due to the charge exchange
and the fact that it is not possible to separate particles into two different
populations as charged and neutral species. So there can be no friction force
between ions and neutrals in the usual sense. The mean force per particle is
proportional to the ionization ratio $n_i/(n_i+ n_n)$. Regarding the
application of the theory to the Alfven wave propagation in the lower solar
atmosphere, the results predict that the plane of displacement of the fluid
must change by 90 degrees when an Alfven wave propagates from the area where
particles are un-magnetized (photosphere) to the area where they are magnetized
(chromosphere). Because of the most accurate cross sections which we have here,
it is possible to very accurately determine altitudes at which such rotation of
the Alfven wave takes place.

be packed into bins of size 1. The goal is to minimize the number of used bins.
In this paper, we present an online bin packing algorithm with asymptotic
competitive ratio of 1.5813. This is the first improvement in fifteen years and
reduces the gap to the lower bound by 15%. Within the well-known SuperHarmonic
framework, no competitive ratio below 1.58333 can be achieved.
  We make two crucial changes to that framework. First, some of our algorithm's
decisions depend on exact sizes of items, instead of only their types. In
particular, for each item with size in (1/3,1/2], we use its exact size to
determine if it can be packed together with an item of size greater than 1/2.
Second, we add constraints to the linear programs considered by Seiden, in
order to better lower bound the optimal solution. These extra constraints are
based on marks that we give to items based on how they are packed by our
algorithm. We show that for each input, a single weighting function can be
constructed to upper bound the competitive ratio on it.
  We use this idea to simplify the analysis of SuperHarmonic, and show that the
algorithm Harmonic++ is in fact 1.58880-competitive (Seiden proved 1.58889),
and that 1.5884 can be achieved within the SuperHarmonic framework. Finally, we
give a lower bound of 1.5762 for our new framework.

coherence of the emission from a semiconductor microcavity in the strong
coupling regime. The confinement, provided by etched micropillars, has a
favorable impact on the temporal coherence of solid state quasi-condensates
that evolve in our device above threshold. By fitting the experimental data
with a microscopic quantum theory based on a quantum jump approach, we
scrutinize the influence of pump power and confinement and find that
phonon-mediated transitions are enhanced in the case of a confined structure,
in which the modes split into a discrete set. By increasing the pump power
beyond the condensation threshold, temporal coherence significantly improves in
devices with increased spatial confinement, as revealed in the transition from
thermal to coherent statistics of the emitted light.

by a fixed surface charge density which is compensated by ``counter-ions''
moving out of the surface. Such classical particle systems exhibit poor
screening properties at any temperature and the trivial bulk regime (far away
from the charged surface) with no particles, so the validity of standard
Coulomb sum rules is questionable. In the present paper, we concentrate on the
two-dimensional version of the model with the logarithmic interaction
potential. We go from the finite disc to the semi-infinite planar geometry. The
system is exactly solvable for two values of the coupling constant $\Gamma$: in
the Poisson-Boltzmann mean-field limit $\Gamma\to 0$ and at the free-fermion
point $\Gamma=2$. We show that the finite-size expansion of the free energy
does not contain universal term as is usual for Coulomb fluids. For the
coupling constant being an arbitrary positive even integer, using an
anticommuting representation of the partition function and many-body densities
we derive a sequence of sum rules. As a result, the contact density of
counter-ions at the wall is available for the disc. The amplitude function,
which characterizes the asymptotic inverse-power law behavior of the two-body
density along the wall, is found to be related to the particle density profile.
The dielectric susceptibility tensor, calculated exactly for an arbitrary
coupling and the particle number, exhibits the anticipated disc value in the
thermodynamic limit, in spite of zero contribution from the bulk region. Some
of the results obtained in the Poisson-Boltzmann limit are generalized to an
arbitrary Euclidean dimension.

larger (~20) in low-mass hot corinos and significantly lower (~1) in high-mass
hot cores. This dichotomy in methanol deuteration between low-mass and massive

rate equation model of the deuterium chemistry occurring in the icy mantles of
interstellar grains. We apply this model to the chemistry of hot corinos and
hot cores, with IRAS 16293-2422 and the Orion~KL Compact Ridge as prototypes,
respectively. The chemistry is based on a statistical initial deuteration at
low temperature followed by a warm-up phase during which thermal
hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchanges occur between water and methanol. The
exchange kinetics is incorporated using laboratory data. The [CH2DOH]/[CH3OD]
ratio is found to scale inversely with the D/H ratio of water, owing to the H/D
exchange equilibrium between the hydroxyl (-OH) functional groups of methanol
and water. Our model is able to reproduce the observed [CH2DOH]/[CH3OD] ratios
provided that the primitive fractionation of water ice [HDO]/[H2O] is ~ 2% in
IRAS 16293-2422 and ~0.6% in Orion~KL. We conclude that the molecular D/H
ratios measured in hot cores may not be representative of the original mantles

ice during the warm-up phase.

of subcollections. With our 2.4 Tbp datasets, the algorithm can merge 600

lasers. Our scheme is compatible with previously proposed non-adiabatic
holonomic two-qubit gates, combining with which the arbitrary holonomic
one-qubit gates can play universal non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation.
We also investigate the effects of some unavoidable realistic errors on our
scheme.

to quantify the dynamics of a suspension of microscopic particles, measuring

that precisely does that and constitutes an alternative method to more
classical techniques such as dynamics light scattering (DLS) or video particle
tracking (VPT). DDM consists in imaging a particle dispersion with a standard
light microscope and a camera. The image analysis requires the students to code
and relies on digital Fourier transform to obtain the intermediate scattering
function, an autocorrelation function that characterizes the dynamics of the
dispersion. We first illustrate DDM on the textbook case of colloids where we
measure the diffusion coefficient. Then we show that DDM is a pertinent tool to
characterize biologic systems such as motile bacteria i.e.bacteria that can
self propel, where we not only determine the diffusion coefficient but also the
velocity and the fraction of motile bacteria. Finally, so that our paper can be
used as a tutorial to the DDM technique, we have joined to this article movies

a welfare optimal allocation in which each buyer is buying bundle of goods that
is individually most preferred. However, this clean story has two caveats.
First, the prices alone are not sufficient to coordinate the market, and buyers
may need to select among their most preferred bundles in a coordinated way to
find a feasible allocation. Second, we don't in practice expect to encounter
exact equilibrium prices tailored to the market, but instead only approximate
prices, somehow encoding ""distributional"" information about the market. How
well do prices work to coordinate markets when tie-breaking is not coordinated,
and they encode only distributional information?
  We answer this question. First, we provide a genericity condition such that
for buyers with Matroid Based Valuations, overdemand with respect to
equilibrium prices is at most 1, independent of the supply of goods, even when
tie-breaking is done in an uncoordinated fashion. Second, we provide
learning-theoretic results that show that such prices are robust to changing

surrogate-based uncertainty quantification, and have been developed
independently in their respective communities over the last 25 years. Despite
tackling similar problems in the field, to our knowledge there has yet to be a
critical comparison of the two approaches in the literature. We begin by
providing a detailed description of polynomial chaos and Gaussian process
approaches for building a surrogate model of a black-box function. The accuracy
of each surrogate method is then tested and compared for two simulators used in
industry: a land-surface model (adJULES) and a launch vehicle controller
(VEGACONTROL). We analyse surrogates built on experimental designs of various
size and type to investigate their performance in a range of modelling
scenarios. Specifically, polynomial chaos and Gaussian process surrogates are
built on Sobol sequence and tensor grid designs. Their accuracy is measured by
their ability to estimate the mean, standard deviation, exceedance
probabilities and probability density function of the simulator output, as well
as a root mean square error metric, based on an independent validation design.
We find that one method does not unanimously outperform the other, but
advantages can be gained in some cases, such that the preferred method depends
on the modelling goals of the practitioner. Our conclusions are likely to
depend somewhat on the modelling choices for the surrogates as well as the
design strategy. We hope that this work will spark future comparisons of the
two methods in their more advanced formulations and for different sampling
strategies.

Galactic low mass X-ray binary V404 Cyg. The observation of the system with
Swift/XRT on June 30 2015 revealed the presence of five concentric ring-like
structures centred at the position of V404 Cyg. Follow-up Swift/XRT
observations allowed a time-dependent study of the X-ray rings. Assuming that
these are the result of small-angle, single X-ray scattering by dust grains
along the line of sight, we find that their angular size scales as $\theta
\propto\sqrt{t}$ in agreement with theoretical predictions. The dust grains are
concentrated in five dust layers located at about 2.12, 2.05, 1.63, 1.50 and
1.18 kpc from the observer. These coincide roughly with locations of enhanced
extinction as determined by infrared photometry. Assuming that the grain size
distribution is described by a generalized Mathis-Rumpl-Nordsieck model, we
find that the power-law index of the most distant cloud is $q\sim 4.4$, while
$q \sim 3.5-3.7$ in all other clouds. We constrain at a $3\sigma$ level the
maximum grain size of the intermediate dust layers in the range
$0.16-0.20\,\mu$m and set a lower limit of $\sim 0.2\,\mu$m in the other
clouds. Hints of an exponential cutoff at the angular intensity profile of the
outermost X-ray ring suggest that the smallest grains have sizes $0.01 \mu{\rm
m}\le \alpha_{\min} \lesssim 0.03\,\mu$m. Based on the relative ratios of dust
column densities we find the highest dust concentration at $\sim 1.6$ kpc. Our
results indicate a gradient in the dust properties within 1 kpc from V404 Cyg.

acts as a chiral chemical potential for electrons via the momentum exchange
with neutrinos and induces a ""helical plasma instability"" that generates a
strong helical magnetic field. This provides a new mechanism for converting the
gravitational energy released by the core collapse to the electromagnetic
energy and potentially explains the origin of magnetars. The other possible
applications of the neutrino chiral transport theory are also discussed.

suggesting a primarily rocky composition. The stellar parameters and abundances
are derived from high signal-to-noise ratio, high-resolution echelle
spectroscopy obtained with the 10-m Keck I telescope and HIRES spectrometer
using standard spectroscopic techniques. The metallicities of the seven stars
range from -0.32 dex to +0.13 dex, with an average metallicity that is
subsolar, supporting previous suggestions that, unlike Jupiter-type giant
planets, small planets do not form preferentially around metal-rich stars. The
abundances of elements other than iron are in line with a population of
Galactic disk stars, and despite our modest sample size, we find hints that the
compositions of stars with small planets are similar to stars without known
planets and with Neptune-size planets, but not to those of stars with giant
planets. This suggests that the formation of small planets does not require
exceptional host-star compositions and that small planets may be ubiquitous in
the Galaxy. We compare our derived abundances (which have typical uncertainties
of <= 0.04 dex) to the condensation temperature of the elements; a correlation
between the two has been suggested as a possible signature of rocky planet
formation. None of the stars demonstrate the putative rocky planet signature,
despite at least three of the stars having rocky planets estimated to contain
enough refractory material to produce the signature, if real. More detailed
abundance analyses of stars known to host small planets are needed to verify
our results and place ever more stringent constraints on planet formation
models.

scintillations over a 3 octave bandwidth. ``Parabolic arcs'', which were
discovered in interstellar scintillations of pulsars, can provide precise
estimates of the distance and velocity of the scattering plasma. Here we report
the first observations of such arcs in the ionosphere and the first broad-band
observations of arcs anywhere, raising hopes that study of the phenomenon may
similarly improve the analysis of ionospheric scintillations. These
observations were made of the strong natural radio source Cygnus-A and covered
the entire 30-250\,MHz band of KAIRA. Well-defined parabolic arcs were seen
early in the observations, before transit, and disappeared after transit
although scintillations continued to be obvious during the entire observation.
We show that this can be attributed to the structure of Cygnus-A. Initial
results from modeling these scintillation arcs are consistent with simultaneous
ionospheric soundings taken with other instruments, and indicate that
scattering is most likely to be associated more with the topside ionosphere
than the F-region peak altitude. Further modeling and possible extension to
interferometric observations, using international LOFAR stations, are

order (quadrupole order, second order in $x_i$), the Hamiltonian consists of
terms which, individually, depend on binary pairs. At higher orders, in

highly suitable for studying the secular evolution of hierarchical systems with

fissiogenic 131-136Xe, respectively, within the Earth, which related isotope
fingerprints are seen in the compositions of mantle and atmospheric Xe. Recent
studies of Archean rocks suggest that xenon atoms have been lost from the
Earth's atmosphere and isotopically fractionated during long periods of
geological time, until at least the end of the Archean eon. Here we build a
model that takes into account these results. Correction for Xe loss permits to
compute new closure ages for the Earth's atmosphere that are in agreement with
those computed for mantle Xe. The minimum Xe formation interval for the Earth-

also date the Moon-forming impact.

the system to have at least two excitations as one needs to explore the

specifically results for the spatially resolved photon-photon correlations of
systems prepared in doubly excited $W$ states and give conditions when the
atomic system emits nonclassial light. Equally, we derive the conditions for
the occurrence of bunching and even of superbunching, a rare phenomenon

fully-convective, and are expected to have a different type of dynamo mechanism
than solar-type stars. Measurements of their rotation rates provide insights
into these mechanisms, but few rotation periods are available for these stars
at field ages. Using photometry from the MEarth transit survey, we measure
rotation periods for 387 nearby, mid-to-late M dwarfs in the Northern
hemisphere, finding periods from 0.1 to 140 days. The typical detected rotator
has stable, sinusoidal photometric modulations at a semi-amplitude of 0.5 to
1%. We find no period-amplitude relation for stars below 0.25Msun and an
anti-correlation between period and amplitude for higher-mass M dwarfs. We
highlight the existence of older, slowly-rotating stars without H{\alpha}
emission that nevertheless have strong photometric variability. The Galactic
kinematics of our sample is consistent with the local population of G and K
dwarfs, and rotators have metallicities characteristic of the Solar
Neighborhood. We use the W space velocities and established age-velocity

that those with P>70 days are about 5 Gyrs. The period distribution is mass

Accepted for publication in A&A","A&A 586, A60 (2016)","10.1051/0004-6361/201527225",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Context. Blazars are among the most energetic objects in the Universe. In
2008 August, Fermi/LAT detected the blazar PKS 1502+106 showing a rapid and
strong gamma-ray outburst followed by high and variable flux over the next
months. This activity at high energies triggered an intensive multi-wavelength
campaign covering also the radio, optical, UV, and X-ray bands indicating that
the flare was accompanied by a simultaneous outburst at optical/UV/X-rays and a
delayed outburst at radio bands.
  Aims: In the current work we explore the phenomenology and physical
conditions within the ultra-relativistic jet of the gamma-ray blazar PKS
1502+106. Additionally, we address the question of the spatial localization of
the MeV/GeV-emitting region of the source.
  Methods: We utilize ultra-high angular resolution mm-VLBI observations at 43
and 86 GHz complemented by VLBI observations at 15 GHz. We also employ
single-dish radio data from the F-GAMMA program at frequencies matching the
VLBI monitoring.
  Results: PKS 1502+106 shows a compact core-jet morphology and fast
superluminal motion with apparent speeds in the range 5--22 c. Estimation of
Doppler factors along the jet yield values between ~7 up to ~50. This Doppler
factor gradient implies an accelerating jet. The viewing angle towards the
source differs between the inner and outer jet, with the former at ~3 degrees
and the latter at ~1 degree, after the jet bends towards the observer beyond 1
mas. The de-projected opening angle of the ultra-fast, magnetically-dominated
jet is found to be (3.8 +/- 0.5) degrees. A single jet component can be
associated with the pronounced flare both at high-energies and in radio bands.
Finally, the gamma-ray emission region is localized at less than 5.9 pc away
from the jet base.

hierarchical modulation as a mean to provide unequal error protection in highly
variable channels over satellite. Foreseeing the increasing need for higher
data rates, this paper tackles the optimization of 64-APSK constellations to
minimize the mean square error between the original and received symbol.
Optimization is performed according to the sensitivity of the data to the
channel errors, by means of genetic algorithms, a well-known technique
currently used in a variety of application domains, when close form solutions
are impractical. Test results show that through non-uniform constellation and
asymmetric symbol mapping, it is possible to significantly reduce the
distortion while preserving bandwidth efficiency. Tests performed on real
signals based on perceptual quality measurements allow validating the proposed
scheme against conventional 64-APSK constellations and CCSDS mapping.

and defines brain graph frequencies associated with different levels of spatial
smoothness across the brain regions. Brain network frequency also enables the
decomposition of brain signals into pieces corresponding to smooth or rapid
variations. We relate graph frequency with principal component analysis when
the networks of interest denote functional connectivity. The methods are
utilized to analyze brain networks and signals as subjects master a simple
motor skill. We observe that brain signals corresponding to different graph
frequencies exhibit different levels of adaptability throughout learning.
Further, we notice a strong association between graph spectral properties of
brain networks and the level of exposure to tasks performed, and recognize the
most contributing and important frequency signatures at different task

opinion dynamics where individuals either hold one of two alternative opinions
or are undecided and interact pairwise while exposed to an external influence.
As media pressure increases, the system moves from pluralism to global
consensus; four distinct classes of collective behavior emerge, crucially
depending on the outcome of direct interactions among individuals holding
opposite opinions. Observed nontrivial behaviors include hysteretic phenomena
and resilience of minority opinions. Notably, consensus could be unachievable
even when media and microscopic interactions are biased in favor of the same
