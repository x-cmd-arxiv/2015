  the Dynamic Programming approach",,,,"Roma01.Math.NA","math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper infinite horizon optimal control problems for nonlinear
high-dimensional dynamical systems are studied. Nonlinear feedback laws can be
computed via the value function characterized as the unique viscosity solution
to the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation which stems from
the dynamic programming approach. However, the bottleneck is mainly due to the
curse of dimensionality and HJB equations are only solvable in a relatively
small dimension. Therefore, a reduced-order model is derived for the dynamical
system and for this purpose the method of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
is used. The resulting errors in the HJB equations are estimated by an a-priori
error analysis, which suggests a new sampling strategy for the POD method.
Numerical experiments illustrates the theoretical findings.

from [Berta et al., Nat. Phys. 6, 659 (2010)] is a unifying principle relating
two distinctive features of quantum mechanics: quantum uncertainty due to
measurement incompatibility, and entanglement. In these relations, quantum
uncertainty takes the form of preparation uncertainty where one of two
incompatible measurements is applied. In particular, the ""uncertainty witness""
lower bound in the EUR-QSI is not a function of a post-measurement state. An
insightful proof of the EUR-QSI from [Coles et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108,
210405 (2012)] makes use of a fundamental mathematical consequence of the
postulates of quantum mechanics known as the non-increase of quantum relative
entropy under quantum channels. Here, we exploit this perspective to establish
a tightening of the EUR-QSI which adds a new state-dependent term in the lower
bound, related to how well one can reverse the action of a quantum measurement.
As such, this new term is a direct function of the post-measurement state and
can be thought of as quantifying how much disturbance a given measurement
causes. Our result thus quantitatively unifies this feature of quantum
mechanics with the others mentioned above. We have experimentally tested our
theoretical predictions on the IBM Quantum Experience and find reasonable
agreement between our predictions and experimental outcomes.

fields. In this extension of the Yang-Mills theory the vector gauge boson
becomes a member of a bigger family of gauge bosons of arbitrary large integer
spins. The proposed extension is essentially based on the extension of the
Poincar\'e algebra and the existence of an appropriate transversal
representations. The invariant Lagrangian is expressed in terms of new
higher-rank field strength tensors. It does not contain higher derivatives of
tensor gauge fields and all interactions take place through three- and
four-particle exchanges with a dimensionless coupling constant. We calculated
the scattering amplitudes of non-Abelian tensor gauge bosons at tree level, as
well as their one-loop contribution into the Callan-Symanzik beta function.
This contribution is negative and corresponds to the asymptotically free
theory. Considering the contribution of tensorgluons of all spins into the beta
function we found that it is leading to the theory which is conformally
invariant at very high energies. The proposed extension may lead to a natural
inclusion of the standard theory of fundamental forces into a larger theory in
which vector gauge bosons, leptons and quarks represent a low-spin subgroup. We
consider a possibility that inside the proton and, more generally, inside
hadrons there are additional partons - tensorgluons, which can carry a part of
the proton momentum. The extension of QCD influences the unification scale at

lower energies.

star-forming cloud depends significantly on the initial degree of rotation.
However, there is no clear understanding of how the initial rotation can affect
the heating and cooling process and hence the temperature that leads to the
fragmentation of the gas during Population III star formation. We report the
results from three\hbox{-}dimensional, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
simulations of a rotating self-gravitating primordial gas cloud with a modified
version of the Gadget-2 code, in which the initial ratio of the rotational to
the gravitational energy ($\beta_0$) is varied over two orders of magnitude. We
find that despite the lack of any initial turbulence and magnetic fields in the
clouds, the angular momentum distribution leads to the formation and build-up
of a disk that fragments into several clumps. We further examine the behavior
of the protostars that form in both idealized as well as more realistic
minihalos from the cosmological simulations. The thermodynamical evolution and
the fragmentation behavior of the cosmological minihalos are similar to that of
the artificial cases, especially in those with a similar $\beta_0$-parameter.
Protostars with a higher rotation support exhibit spiral-arm-like structures on
several scales, and have lower accretion rates. These type of clouds tend to
fragment more, while some of the protostars escape from the cluster with the
possibility of surviving until the present day. They also take much longer to

find that the mean fitness of a population under the selection of pre-existing

analyses to incorporate context-dependent, non-Euclidean structure. Here we
describe how to take a step beyond ordination plots and incorporate this

joint eigen properties of multiple similarity matrices, or kernels. This allows
for multivariate regression models to incorporate both a matrix of microbial
abundances and, for instance, a matrix of phylogenetically-informed
similarities between the abundance profiles. Further, we show how this
regression framework can be used to address the compositional nature of
multivariate predictors comprised of relative abundances; that is, vectors
whose entries sum to a constant. We illustrate this regression framework with
several simulations using data from two recent studies on the gut and vaginal
microbiome. We conclude with an application to our own data, where we also
incorporate a significance test for the estimated coefficients that represent

their centre surrounded by a tenuous gas environment, leading to no significant
emission. In these quiescent galaxies, tidal disruption events represent a
powerful detection method for the central black hole. Following the disruption,
the stellar debris evolves into an elongated gas stream, which partly falls
back towards the disruption site and accretes onto the black hole producing a
luminous flare. Using an analytical treatment, we investigate the interaction
between the debris stream and the gas environment of quiescent galaxies.
Although we find dynamical effects to be negligible, we demonstrate that
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can lead to the dissolution of the stream into the
ambient medium before it reaches the black hole, likely dimming the associated
flare. This result is robust against the presence of a typical stellar magnetic
field and fast cooling within the stream. Furthermore, we find this effect to
be enhanced for disruptions involving more massive black holes and/or giant
stars. Consequently, although disruptions of evolved stars have been proposed
as a useful probe of black holes with masses $\gtrsim 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, we
argue that the associated flares are likely less luminous than expected.

enough mass for self-gravitation, described by the Toomre parameter, and when
heat can be lost at a rate comparable to the local dynamical timescale,

the cooling parameter has a rough critical value at beta_crit=3. When below
beta_crit, gas overdensities will contract under their own gravity and fragment
into bound objects while otherwise maintaining a steady state of
gravitoturbulence. However, previous studies of the critical cooling parameter
have found dependence on simulation resolution, indicating that the simulation
of self-gravitating protoplanetary disks is not so straightforward. In
particular, the simplicity of the cooling timescale t_c prevents fragments from
being disrupted by pressure support as temperatures rise. We alter the cooling
law so that the cooling timescale is dependent on local surface density
fluctuations, a means of incorporating optical depth effects into the local
cooling of an object. For lower resolution simulations, this results in a lower
critical cooling parameter and a disk more stable to gravitational stresses
suggesting the formation of large gas giants planets in large, cool disks is
generally suppressed by more realistic cooling. At our highest resolution
however, the model becomes unstable to fragmentation for cooling timescales up
to beta = 10.

accounting for the cluster distribution has a small effect at intermediate

obtained by taking the connected sum of $L$ with a Hopf link and considering
$SO(3)$ representations with $w_2$ supported near the extra component, is a
smooth compact manifold without boundary of dimension $2n-3$, which Lagrangian
immerses into the smooth stratum of $R(S^2,\{a_i,b_i\}_{i=1}^n)$.
  The proofs of these assertions consist of stratified transversality arguments
to eliminate non-generic strata in the character variety and to insure that the
restriction map to the boundary character variety is also generic.
  The main tool introduced to establish abundance of holonomy perturbations is
the use of holonomy perturbations along curves $C$ in a cylinder $F\times I$,
where $F$ is a closed surface. When $C$ is obtained by pushing an embedded
curve on $F$ into the cylinder, we prove that the corresponding holonomy
perturbation induces one of Goldman's generalized Hamiltonian twist flows on
the $SU(2)$ character variety $\mathcal{M}(F)$ associated to the curve $C$.

for the accelerators of cosmic rays within the Galaxy through the process of
diffusive shock acceleration. The connection between SNRs and cosmic rays is
supported by the detection of high energy (HE; 100 MeV to 100 GeV) and very
high energy (VHE; 100 GeV to 100 TeV) gamma rays from young and middle-aged
SNRs. However, the interpretation of the gamma-ray observations is not unique.
This is because gamma rays can be produced both by electrons through
non-thermal Bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton scattering, and by protons
through proton-proton collisions and subsequent neutral-pion decay. To
disentangle and quantify the contributions of electrons and protons to the
gamma-ray flux, it is necessary to measure precisely the spectra and morphology
of SNRs over a broad range of gamma-ray energies. Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is one
such young SNR (~ 350 years) which is bright in radio and X-rays. It has been
detected as a bright point source in HE gamma rays by Fermi-LAT and in VHE
gamma rays by HEGRA, MAGIC and VERITAS. Cas A has been observed with VERITAS
for more than 60 hours, tripling the published exposure. The observations span
2007-2013, and half of the data were taken at large zenith angles to boost the
effective area above few TeV. We will present the detailed spectral and

vectors of choice probabilities are the convex combinations of the

prominent types of order relations are linear orders, weak orders, semiorders,
interval orders and partial orders. For each of them, the problem of finding a
complete, workable characterization of the vectors of probabilities is
crucial---but it is reputably inaccessible. Under a geometric reformulation,
the problem asks for a linear description of a convex polytope whose vertices
are known. As for any convex polytope, a shortest linear description comprises
one linear inequality per facet. Getting all of the facet-defining inequalities
of any of the five order polytopes seems presently out of reach. Here we search
for the facet-defining inequalities which we call primary because their
coefficients take only the values -1, 0 or 1. We provide a classification of
all primary, facet-defining inequalities of three of the five order polytopes.
Moreover, we elaborate on the intricacy of the primary facet-defining

sixties and seventies with work of Voskresenkii, Endo, Miyata,
Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc. There was particular interest in determining
the rationality of a given algebraic $k$-tori. As rationality problems for
algebraic varieties are in general difficult, it is natural to consider relaxed
notions such as stable rationality, or even retract rationality. Work of the
above authors and later Saltman in the eighties determined necessary and
sufficient conditions to determine when an algebraic torus is stably rational,
respectively retract rational in terms of the integral representations of its
associated character lattice. An interesting question is to ask whether a
stably rational algebraic $k$-torus is always rational. In the general case,
there exist examples of non-rational stably rational $k$-varieties. Algebraic
$k$-tori of dimension $r$ are classified up to isomorphism by conjugacy classes
of finite subgroups of GL$_r(\mathbb{Z})$. This makes it natural to examine the
rationality problem for algebraic $k$-tori of small dimensions. In 1967,
Voskresenskii proved that all algebraic tori of dimension 2 are rational. In
1990, Kunyavskii determined which algebraic tori of dimension 3 were rational.
In 2012, Hoshi and Yamasaki determined which algebraic tori of dimensions 4 and
5 were stably (respectively retract) rational with the aid of GAP. They did not
address the rationality question in dimensions 4 and 5. In this paper, we show
that all stably rational algebraic $k$-tori of dimension 4 are rational, with
the possible exception of 10 undetermined cases which fall into 2 families. We
reprove the stable rationality of the exceptional families of algebraic tori

traveling data from a large number of vehicles, the insurance company could
build a classifier to predict a new driver's driving style: aggressive or
defensive. However, collection of such vehicle traveling data explicitly
breaches the drivers' personal privacy. To tackle such privacy concerns, this
paper presents a privacy-preserving driving style recognition technique to
securely predict aggressive and defensive drivers for the insurance company
without compromising the privacy of all the participating parties. The
insurance company cannot learn any private information from the vehicles, and
vice-versa. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of the privacy-preserving
driving style recognition technique are validated with experimental results.

Near-Eddington infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosities coupled with
high dust opacities at these frequencies suggest that radiation pressure on
dust can play a significant role in shaping the torus. To explore the possible
effects of radiation pressure, we perform three-dimensional radiative
hydrodynamics simulations of an initially smooth torus. Our code solves the

highly dynamic situation. IR radiation is anisotropic, leaving primarily
through the central hole. The torus inner surface exhibits a break in
axisymmetry under the influence of radiation and differential rotation;
clumping follows. In addition, UV radiation pressure on dust launches a strong
wind along the inner surface; when scaled to realistic AGN parameters, this

transparency radius in a low-power jet outflow can fit the prompt thermal X-ray
emission, and the nonthermal X-rays and gamma-rays may be produced via Compton
scattering of thermal photons from hot leptons in the jet interior or the
external shocks. The later mildly relativistic phase of this outflow can
produce the radio emission via synchrotron radiation from the forward shock.
Meanwhile, interaction of the associated SN 2006aj with a circumstellar
envelope extending to $\sim10^{13}$ cm can explain the early optical emission.
The X-ray afterglow can be interpreted as a light echo of the prompt emission
from dust at $\sim 30$ pc. Our model is a plausible alternative to that of
Nakar, who recently proposed shock breakout of a jet smothered by an extended
envelope as the source of prompt emission. Both our results and Nakar's suggest
that bursts such as GRB 060218 may originate from unusual progenitors with

0.3 kpc from the Sun. The median age of the identified members is estimated to
be about 1.3 Myr from comparison of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) with

the HRD and the near-infrared (J, J-H) color-magnitude diagram. The slope of
the IMF is about Gamma = -1.6 +/- 0.1, which is slightly steeper than that of
the Salpeter/Kroupa IMF. It implies that low-mass star formation is dominant in

nested/alternating fixed points what invariants are to safety/greatest fixed

progress measures are combination of the latter two notions (invariant and

Vol. 24(3), 2017, #P3.29",,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $G$ be a connected graph with maximum degree $\Delta$. Brooks' theorem
states that $G$ has a $\Delta$-coloring unless $G$ is a complete graph or an
odd cycle. A graph $G$ is \emph{degree-choosable} if $G$ can be properly
colored from its lists whenever each vertex $v$ gets a list of $d(v)$ colors.
In the context of list coloring, Brooks' theorem can be strengthened to the
following. Every connected graph $G$ is degree-choosable unless each block of
$G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle; such a graph $G$ is a \emph{Gallai
tree}.
  This degree-choosability result was further strengthened to Alon--Tarsi
orientations; these are orientations of $G$ in which the number of spanning
Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges differs from the number with an
odd number of edges. A graph $G$ is \emph{degree-AT} if $G$ has an Alon--Tarsi
orientation in which each vertex has indegree at least 1. Alon and Tarsi showed
that if $G$ is degree-AT, then $G$ is also degree-choosable. Hladky, Kral, and
Schauz showed that a connected graph is degree-AT if and only if it is not a
Gallai tree. In this paper, we consider pairs $(G,x)$ where $G$ is a connected
graph and $x$ is some specified vertex in $V(G)$. We characterize pairs such
that $G$ has no Alon--Tarsi orientation in which each vertex has indegree at
least 1 and $x$ has indegree at least 2. When $G$ is 2-connected, the
characterization is simple to state.

especially shocks in molecular outflows. It is a key molecule for exploring
whether the physical properties of low-mass protostars can be extrapolated to
massive YSOs. As part of the WISH key programme, we investigate the dynamics
and the excitation conditions of shocks along the outflow cavity wall as
function of source luminosity. Velocity-resolved Herschel-HIFI spectra of the
H2O 988, 752, 1097 GHz and 12CO J=10-9, 16-15 lines were analysed for 52 YSOs
with bolometric luminosities (L_bol) ranging from <1 to >10^5 L_sun. The
profiles of the H2O lines are similar, indicating that they probe the same gas.
We see two main Gaussian emission components in all YSOs: a broad component
associated with non-dissociative shocks in the outflow cavity wall (cavity
shocks) and a narrow component associated with quiescent envelope material.
More than 60% of the total integrated intensity of the H2O lines (L_H2O) comes
from the cavity shock component. The H2O line widths are similar for all YSOs,
whereas those of 12CO 10-9 increase slightly with L_bol. The excitation
analysis of the cavity shock component, performed with the non-LTE radiative
transfer code RADEX, shows stronger 752 GHz emission for high-mass YSOs, likely
due to pumping by an infrared radiation field. As previously found for CO, a
strong correlation with slope unity is measured between log(L_H2O) and
log(L_bol), which can be extrapolated to extragalactic sources. We conclude
that the broad component of H2O and high-J CO lines originate in shocks in the
outflow cavity walls for all YSOs, whereas lower-J CO transitions mostly trace
entrained outflow gas. The higher UV field and turbulent motions in high-mass
objects compared to their low-mass counterparts may explain the slightly
different kinematical properties of 12CO 10-9 and H2O lines from low- to
high-mass YSOs.

the NS mass. We have shown that mass of an isolated NS can, in principle, be

with its ellipticity $10^{-6}$ at 1 kpc is typically measurable with precision
of 20% using the ET, if the NS is precessing or has a pinned superfluid core

misalignment angle (""wobble angle"" in the case of a precessing NS) on the mass

applications. Most existing approaches for core decomposition assume that the
graph is kept in memory of a machine. Nevertheless, many real-world graphs are
big and may not reside in memory. In the literature, there is only one work for
I/O efficient core decomposition that avoids loading the whole graph in memory.
However, this approach is not scalable to handle big graphs because it cannot
bound the memory size and may load most parts of the graph in memory. In
addition, this approach can hardly handle graph updates. In this paper, we
study I/O efficient core decomposition following a semi-external model, which
only allows node information to be loaded in memory. This model works well in
many web-scale graphs. We propose a semi-external algorithm and two optimized
algorithms for I/O efficient core decomposition using very simple structures
and data access model. To handle dynamic graph updates, we show that our
algorithm can be naturally extended to handle edge deletion. We also propose an
I/O efficient core maintenance algorithm to handle edge insertion, and an
improved algorithm to further reduce I/O and CPU cost by investigating some new
graph properties. We conduct extensive experiments on 12 real large graphs. Our
optimal algorithm significantly outperform the existing I/O efficient algorithm
in terms of both processing time and memory consumption. In many
memory-resident graphs, our algorithms for both core decomposition and
maintenance can even outperform the in-memory algorithm due to the simple
structures and data access model used. Our algorithms are very scalable to
handle web-scale graphs. As an example, we are the first to handle a web graph

inflation concept describes the Universe very well. However, there are still a
few concerns: new Planck data impose constraints on the shape of the inflaton
potential, which exclude a lot of inflationary models; dark matter is not
detected directly, and dark energy is not understood theoretically on a
satisfactory level. In this brief sketch we investigate an alternative
cosmological model with spherical spatial geometry and an additional perfect
fluid with the constant parameter $\omega=-1/3$ in the linear equation of
state. It is demonstrated explicitly that in the framework of such a model it
is possible to satisfy the supernovae data at the same level of accuracy as
within the $\Lambda$CDM model and at the same time suppose that the observed
cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation originates from a very limited
space region. This is ensured by introducing an additional condition of light
propagation between the antipodal points during the age of the Universe.
Consequently, the CMB uniformity can be explained without the inflation
scenario. The corresponding drawbacks of the model with respect to its
comparison with the CMB data are also discussed.

tool to find exact solutions. On the other hand, symmetry might hint the deep
physical structure of a theory, and hence considering symmetry is also well
motivated. As is well known, Noether symmetry has been extensively used in
physics. Recently, the so-called Hojman symmetry was also considered in the
literature. Hojman symmetry directly deals with the equations of motion, rather
than Lagrangian or Hamiltonian, unlike Noether symmetry. In this work, we
consider Hojman symmetry in $f(R)$ theories in both the metric and Palatini
formalisms, and find the corresponding exact cosmological solutions of $f(R)$
theories via Hojman symmetry. There exist some new solutions significantly
different from the ones obtained by using Noether symmetry in $f(R)$ theories.
To our knowledge, they also have not been found previously in the literature.

subcarrier grouping size and precoded MIMO signals in the same group with

but such a process would lead to system capacity loss due to the channel

over double-selective i.i.d. Rayleigh channels and investigate the quantitative
relation between group size and capacity loss theoretically. By exploiting our
developed theoretical results, we also propose an adaptive subcarrier grouping
algorithm, which not only enables to have a good control of system service

are shown to provide valuable insights on the system design of MIMO-OFDM

subsystems is a common practice for modularity and standardization of
components and design algorithms. Although not typically cast in this
framework, many of these approaches can be viewed within the mathematical
context of functional composition. This paper re-interprets and generalizes
within the functional composition framework one such approach known as filter
sharpening, i.e. interconnecting filter modules which have significant
approximation error in order to obtain improved filter characteristics. More
specifically, filter sharpening is approached by determining the composing
polynomial to minimize the infinity-norm of the approximation error, utilizing
the First Algorithm of Remez. This is applied both to sharpening for FIR,
even-symmetric filters and for the more general case of subfilters that have
complex-valued frequency responses including causal IIR filters and for
continuous-time filters. Within the framework of functional composition, this
paper also explores the use of functional decomposition to approximate a
desired system as a composition of simpler functions based on a two-norm on the
approximation error. Among the potential advantages of this decomposition is
the ability for modular implementation in which the inner component of the
functional decomposition represents the subfilters and the outer the
interconnection.

on a local, covariant and gauge-invariant Lagrangian where the dynamical fields
transform non-trivially under the action of internal gauge transformations. The
theories of interest include General Relativity formulated in terms of tetrads,
Einstein-Yang-Mills theory and Einstein-Dirac theory. Since the dynamical
fields of these theories have gauge freedom, we argue that there is no group
action of diffeomorphisms of spacetime on such dynamical fields. In general,
such fields cannot even be represented as smooth, globally well-defined tensor
fields on spacetime. Consequently the derivation of the first law by Iyer-Wald
cannot be used directly. We show how such theories can be formulated on a
principal bundle and that there is a natural action of automorphisms of the
bundle on the fields. These bundle automorphisms encode both spacetime
diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations. Using this reformulation we define
the Noether charge associated to an infinitesimal automorphism and the
corresponding notion of stationarity and axisymmetry of the dynamical fields.
We define certain potentials and charges at the horizon of a black hole so that
the potentials are constant on the bifurcate Killing horizon, giving a
generalised zeroth law for bifurcate Killing horizons. We identify the
gravitational potential and perturbed charge as the temperature and perturbed
entropy of the black hole which gives an explicit formula for the perturbed
entropy analogous to the Wald entropy formula. We obtain a general first law of
black hole mechanics for such theories. The first law relates the perturbed
Hamiltonians at spatial infinity and the horizon, and the horizon contributions
take the form of a potential times perturbed charge term. We also comment on
the ambiguities in defining a prescription for the total entropy for black
holes.

of extremely rare processes, usually at relatively low energies. The near term
strategies of the global energy frontier particle physics community are
centered on fully exploiting the physics potential of the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) at CERN through its high-luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC), while the intensity
frontier HEP research is focused on studies of neutrinos at the MW-scale beam
power accelerator facilities, such as Fermilab Main Injector with the planned
PIP-II SRF linac project. A number of next generation accelerator facilities
have been proposed and are currently under consideration for the medium- and

requires high numerical aperture (NA) objective lens and the transmission
masks. We demonstrate an ultralong needle-like focus in the optical range
produced with an ordinary lens. This is achieved by focusing a symmetric Airy
beam (SAB) generated via binary spectral modulation with a digital micromirror
device(DMD). Such amplitude modulation technique is able to shape traditional
Airy beams, SABs, as well as the dynamic transition modes between the
one-dimensional(1D) and two-dimensional (2D) symmetric Airy modes. The created
2D SAB was characterized through measurement of the propagating fields with one
of the four main lobes blocked by an opaque mask. The 2D SAB was verified to
exhibit self-healing property against propagation with the obstructed major
lobe reconstructed after a certain distance. We further produced an elongated
focal line by concentrating the SAB via lenses with different NA's, and
achieved an ultralong longitudinal needle focus. The produced long needle focus
will be applied in optical, chemical, and biological sciences.

augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm (SALSA) with majorization-minimization

optimization, as they can be minimized and approximately maximized in
polynomial time. A key element in many of the algorithms and analyses is the
possibility of extending the submodular set-function to a convex function,
which opens up tools from convex optimization. Submodularity goes beyond
set-functions and has naturally been considered for problems with multiple
labels or for functions defined on continuous domains, where it corresponds
essentially to cross second-derivatives being nonpositive. In this paper, we
show that most results relating submodularity and convexity for set-functions
can be extended to all submodular functions. In particular, (a) we naturally
define a continuous extension in a set of probability measures, (b) show that
the extension is convex if and only if the original function is submodular, (c)
prove that the problem of minimizing a submodular function is equivalent to a
typically non-smooth convex optimization problem, and (d) propose another
convex optimization problem with better computational properties (e.g., a
smooth dual problem). Most of these extensions from the set-function situation
are obtained by drawing links with the theory of multi-marginal optimal
transport, which provides also a new interpretation of existing results for
set-functions. We then provide practical algorithms to minimize generic
submodular functions on discrete domains, with associated convergence rates.

over discrete control systems represented as Simulink diagrams, using different
model checking approaches and tools. Model checking comprises the (exhaustive)
exploration of a model of a system, to determine if a requirement is satisfied.
If that is not the case, examples of the requirement's violation within the
system's model are provided, as witnesses. These examples are potentially
complementary to previous work on automatic theorem proving, when a system is
not proven to be stable, but no proof of instability can be provided.
  We experimentally evaluated the suitability of four model checking approaches
to verify stability on a set of benchmarks including linear and nonlinear,
controlled and uncontrolled, discrete systems, via Lyapunov's second method or
Lyapunov's direct method. Our study included symbolic, bounded, statistical and
hybrid model checking, through the open-source tools NuSMV, UCLID, S-TaLiRo and
SpaceEx, respectively. Our experiments and results provide an insight on the
strengths and limitations of these model checking approaches for the
verification of control requirements for discrete systems at Simulink level. We
found that statistical model checking with S-TaLiRo is the most suitable option
to complement our previous work on automatic theorem proving.

no longer be computed within the ensemble picture. The resulting mathematical
difficulties pose severe limits to the analytical understanding of
path-dependent processes. Their statistics is typically non-multinomial in the
sense that the multiplicities of the occurrence of states is not a multinomial
factor. The maximum entropy principle is tightly related to multinomial
processes, non-interacting systems, and to the ensemble picture; It loses its
meaning for path-dependent processes. Here we show that an equivalent to the
ensemble picture exists for path-dependent processes, such that the
non-multinomial statistics of the underlying dynamical process, by
construction, is captured correctly in a functional that plays the role of a
relative entropy. We demonstrate this for self-reinforcing P\'olya urn
processes, which explicitly generalise multinomial statistics. We demonstrate
the adequacy of this constructive approach towards non-multinomial pendants of
entropy by computing frequency and rank distributions of P\'olya urn processes.
We show how microscopic update rules of a path-dependent process allow us to
explicitly construct a non-multinomial entropy functional, that, when
maximized, predicts the time-dependent distribution function.

all-to-all broadcast coded slotted ALOHA (B-CSA) for reliable all-to-all

transmitter and receiver in a half-duplex mode. The half-duplex mode gives rise
to a double unequal error protection (DUEP) phenomenon: the more a user repeats
its packet, the higher the probability that this packet is decoded by other
users, but the lower the probability for this user to decode packets from
others. We analyze the performance of B-CSA over the packet erasure channel for
a finite frame length. In particular, we provide a general analysis of stopping
sets for B-CSA and derive an analytical approximation of the performance in the
error floor (EF) region, which captures the DUEP feature of B-CSA. Simulation
results reveal that the proposed approximation predicts very well the
performance of B-CSA in the EF region. Finally, we consider the application of
B-CSA to vehicular communications and compare its performance with that of
carrier sense multiple access (CSMA), the current MAC protocol in vehicular
networks. The results show that B-CSA is able to support a much larger number

of interest, but also the serial dependence plays a crucial role. Drees and
Rootz\'en (2010) established limit theorems for a general class of empirical
processes of so-called cluster functionals which can be used to analyse various
aspects of the extreme value behavior of mixing time series. However, usually
the limit distribution is too complex to enable a direct construction of
confidence regions. Therefore, we suggest a multiplier block bootstrap analog
to the empirical processes of cluster functionals. It is shown that under
virtually the same conditions as used by Drees and Rootz\'en (2010),
conditionally on the data, the bootstrap processes converge to the same limit
distribution. These general results are applied to construct confidence regions
for the empirical extremogram introduced by Davis and Mikosch (2009). In a
simulation study, the confidence intervals constructed by our multiplier block
bootstrap approach compare favorably to the stationary bootstrap proposed by
Davis et al.\ (2012).

we observe hole pockets at the center and electron pockets at the corner of the
Brillouin zone (BZ). However, on a finer level, the electronic structure around
the $\Gamma$- and $Z$-points in $k$-space is substantially different from other
iron pnictides, in that we observe two hole pockets at the $\Gamma$-point, and
more interestingly only one hole pocket is seen at the $Z$-point, whereas in
$1111$-, $111$-, and $122$-type compounds, three hole pockets could be readily
found at the zone center. Another major difference noted in the
Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ superconductors is that the top of innermost
hole-like band moves away from the Fermi level to higher binding energy on
going from $\Gamma$ to $Z$, quite opposite to the iron pnictides. The
polarization dependence of the observed features was used to aid the
attribution of the orbital character of the observed bands. Photon energy
dependent measurements suggest a weak $k_z$ dispersion for the outer hole
pocket and a moderate $k_z$ dispersion for the inner hole pocket. By evaluating
the momentum and energy dependent spectral widths, the single-particle
self-energy was extracted and interestingly this shows a pronounced non-Fermi

solar-wind speed solely from the magnetic-field structure in the low corona.
Our models are computed in a domain between the solar surface and 2.5 solar

non-potential field has a more complex magnetic skeleton and quasi-separatrix
structures than the potential field, leading to different sub-structure in the

perturb the separatrix surfaces traced down from the base of the heliospheric

partly because magnetic flux tubes expand less rapidly with height, but more
importantly because more open field lines are further from coronal-hole

depending on the flux limit of the sample. In this work we produce the
mathematical formalism that allows us to use this information in order to
uncover the underlining rest-frame probability density function of measurable

intervals of $\sim$3\% of the intrinsic timescale the error of the method is as
low as 1\% in recovering the intrinsic rest-frame timescale. We applied our
method to rotations of the optical polarization angle of blazars observed by
RoboPol. We found that the intrinsic timescales of the longest-duration

be invariant under one-parameter point transformations provides us with two
families of power-law potentials for the Brans-Dicke field, in which the powers
are functions of the Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega_{BD}$ and the parameter $w$.
The existence of the Lie symmetry in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is equivalent
to the existence of a conserved quantity in field equations and with
oscillatory terms in the wavefunction of the universe. This enables us to solve
the field equations. For a specific value of the conserved quantity, we find a
closed-form solution for the Hubble factor, which is equivalent to a
cosmological model in general relativity containing two perfect fluids. This
provides us with different models for specific values of the parameters
$\omega_{BD},$ and $w$. Finally, the results hold for the specific case where

is thought to be challenging that both data parallelism and model parallelism

and Big model size with up to trillions of parameters. zenLDA combines both
algorithm level improvements and system level optimizations. It first presents
a novel CGS algorithm that balances the time complexity, model accuracy and
parallelization flexibility. The input corpus in zenLDA is represented as a
directed graph and model parameters are annotated as the corresponding vertex
attributes. The distributed training is parallelized by partitioning the graph
that in each iteration it first applies CGS step for all partitions in
parallel, followed by synchronizing the computed model each other. In this way,
both data parallelism and model parallelism are achieved by converting them to
graph parallelism. We revisited the tradeoff between system efficiency and
model accuracy and presented approximations such as unsynchronized model,
sparse model initialization and ""converged"" token exclusion. zenLDA is built on
GraphX in Spark that provides distributed data abstraction (RDD) and expressive
APIs to simplify the programming efforts and simultaneously hides the system
complexities. This enables us to implement other CGS algorithm with a few lines
of code change. To better fit in distributed data-parallel framework and
achieve comparable performance with contemporary systems, we also presented
several system level optimizations to push the performance limit. zenLDA was
evaluated it against web-scale corpus, and the result indicates that zenLDA can
achieve about much better performance than other CGS algorithm we implemented,
and simultaneously achieve better model accuracy.

centrality greatly outperforms the basic centrality of a node such as the
degree and coreness in ranking node influence and identifying the most
influential spreaders. Interestingly, we discover a saturation effect in
considering the neighborhood of a node, which is not the case of the larger the
better. Specifically speaking, considering the 2-step neighborhood of nodes is
a good choice that balances the cost and performance. If further step of
neighborhood is taken into consideration, there is no obvious improvement and
even decrease in the ranking performance. The saturation effect may be
informative for studies that make use of the local structure of a node to

(relativized, constructive) dimension of a single point in a set E in a
Euclidean space to establish a lower bound on the (classical) Hausdorff
dimension of E. We then use this principle, together with conditional
Kolmogorov complexity in Euclidean spaces, to give a new proof of the known,
two-dimensional case of the Kakeya conjecture. This theorem of geometric

pulsations were discovered as yet, and unless other properties of the X-ray
source and/or the optical counterpart confirm their HMXB nature, they remain
only candidate HMXBs. From a literature search we collected a catalogue of 148
confirmed and candidate HMXBs in the SMC and investigated their properties to
shed light on their real nature. Based on the sample of well-established HMXBs
(the pulsars), we investigated which observed properties are most appropriate
for a reliable classification. We defined different levels of confidence for a
genuine HMXB based on spectral and temporal characteristics of the X-ray
sources and colour-magnitude diagrams from the optical to the infrared of their
likely counterparts. We also took the uncertainty in the X-ray position into
account. We identify 27 objects that probably are misidentified because they
lack an infrared excess of the proposed counterpart. They were mainly X-ray
sources with a large positional uncertainty. This is supported by additional
information obtained from more recent observations. Our catalogue comprises 121
relatively high-confidence HMXBs (the vast majority with Be companion stars).
About half of the objects show X-ray pulsations, while for the rest no
pulsations are known as yet. A comparison of the two subsamples suggests that
long pulse periods in excess of a few 100 s are expected for the ""non-pulsars"",

in multi-user multiple input single output downlink channels. The optimization
problem in this system model is difficult to solve in general, since it is in
non-convex fractional form. Hence, conventional algorithms have addressed the
problem in an iterative manner for each channel realization, which leads to
high computational complexity. To tackle this complexity issue, we propose a
new simple method by utilizing the fact that the EE maximization is identical
to the spectral efficiency (SE) maximization for the region of the power below
a certain transmit power referred to as saturation power. In order to calculate
the saturation power, we first introduce upper and lower bounds of the EE
performance by adopting a maximal ratio transmission beamforming strategy.
Then, we propose an efficient way to compute the saturation power for the EE
maximization problem. Once we determine the saturation power corresponding to
the maximum EE in advance, we can solve the EE maximization problem with SE
maximization schemes with low complexity. The derived saturation power is
parameterized by employing random matrix theory, which relies only on the
second order channel statistics. Hence, this approach requires much lower
computational complexity compared to a conventional scheme which exploits
instantaneous channel state information, and provides insight on the saturation
power. Numerical results validate that the proposed algorithm achieves near
optimal EE performance with significantly reduced complexity.

leading-order effective Lagrangian L_2. We focus our attention on the most
important O(p^4) divergences, which are provided by the loops of Higgs and
electroweak Goldstones, as these particle are the only ones that couple through

effective operators, and set their running. This implies the presence of chiral
logarithms in the amplitudes along with the O(p^4) low-energy couplings, which
are of a similar importance and should not be neglected in next-to-leading
order effective theory calculations, e.g. in composite scenarios.

iterated immediate snapshot (IIS) complexity of the Weak Symmetry Breaking task
(WSB). Our rather unexpected main theorem states that there exist infinitely
many values of n, such that WSB for n~processes is solvable by a certain
explicitly constructed 3-round IIS protocol. In particular, the minimal number
of rounds, which an IIS protocol needs in order to solve the WSB task, does not
go to infinity, when the number of processes goes to infinity. Our methods can
also be used to generate such values of n.
  We phrase our proofs in combinatorial language, while avoiding using
topology. To this end, we study a~certain class of graphs, which we call flip
graphs. These graphs encode adjacency structure in certain subcomplexes of
iterated standard chromatic subdivisions of a simplex. While keeping the
geometric background in mind for an additional intuition, we develop the
structure theory of matchings in flip graphs in a purely combinatorial way. Our
bound for the IIS complexity is then a corollary of this general theory.
  As an afterthought of our result, we suggest to change the overall paradigm.
Specifically, we think, that the bounds on the IIS complexity of solving WSB
for n processes should be formulated in terms of the size of the solutions of
the associated Diophantine equation, rather than in terms of the value n
itself.

(LHB), a concentration of impacts in the last phase of the Hadean eon. In this
paper, we calculate the effects of LHB on Hadean continental crust in order to
investigate this hypothesis. Approximating the size-frequency distribution of
the impacts by a power-law scaling with an exponent {\alpha} as a parameter, we
have derived semi-analytical expressions for the effects of LHB impacts. We
calculated the total excavation/melting volume and area affected by the LHB
from two constraints of LHB on the moon, the size of the largest basin during
LHB, and the density of craters larger than 20 km. We also investigated the
effects of the value of {\alpha}. Our results show that LHB does not
excavate/melt all of Hadean continental crust directly, but over 70% of the
Earth's surface area can be covered by subsequent melts in a broad range of
{\alpha}. If there have been no overturns of the continental crust until today,
LHB could be responsible for the absence of Hadean rocks because most of Hadean
continental crust is not be exposed on the Earth's surface in this case.

Randomized sampling, however, is sensitive to noise that can lead to reduced

detection method based upon randomized isosceles triangles sampling to improve
the robustness of randomized circle detection in noisy conditions. It is shown
that the geometrical property of isosceles triangles provide a robust criterion
to find relevant edge pixels and thereby efficiently provide an estimation of
the circle center and radii. The estimated results given by the isosceles
triangles sampling from each connected component of edge map were analyzed
using a simple clustering approach for efficiency. To further improve on the
accuracy we applied a two-step refinement process using chords and linear error
compensation with gradient information of the edge pixels. Extensive
experiments using both synthetic and real images were presented and results
were compared to leading state-of-the-art algorithms and showed that the
proposed algorithm: are efficient in finding circles with a low number of
iterations; has high rejection rate of false-positive circle candidates; and
has high robustness against noise, making it adaptive and useful in many vision

We present the case of the cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud, and
its star-forming region N66, and we propose a scenario for its formation, based
on observations of the rich stellar populations in the region. Young massive
clusters (YMCs) host a high fraction of early-type stars, indicating an
extremely high star formation efficiency. The Magellanic Clouds host a wide
range of such clusters with the youngest being still embedded in their giant
HII regions. Hubble Space Telescope imaging of such star-forming complexes
allows the detailed study of star formation at scales typical for molecular
clouds. Our cluster analysis of newly-born stars in N66 shows that star
formation in the region proceeds in a clumpy hierarchical fashion, leading to
the formation of both a dominant YMC, hosting about half of the observed
pre--main-sequence population, and a dispersed self-similar distribution of the
remaining stars. We investigate the correlation between star formation rate
derived from star-counts and molecular gas surface density in order to unravel
the physical conditions that gave birth to NGC 346. We find a steep correlation
between these two parameters with a considerable scatter. The fraction of mass
in stars is found to be systematically higher within the central 15 pc (where
the YMC is located) than outside, which suggests variations in the star
formation efficiency within the same star-forming complex. This trend possibly
reflects a change of star formation efficiency in N66 between clustered and
non-clustered star formation. Our findings suggest that the formation of NGC
346 is the combined result of star formation regulated by turbulence and of
early dynamical evolution induced by the gravitational potential of the dense
interstellar medium.

nm where $\mathrm{YAG:Ce}^{+3}$ absorbs. The diffuse absorption
$\mu_{\mathrm{a}} =\frac{1}{l_{\mathrm{abs}}}$ spectrum is qualitative similar
to the absorption coefficient of $\mathrm{YAG:Ce}^{+3}$ in powder, with the
$\mu_{\mathrm{a}}$ spectrum being wider than the absorption coefficient. We
propose a design rule for the solid-state lighting diffuser plates.

the same region of the sky, the large and small-scale (pc) structure of the
Galactic ISM can be investigated. This paper determines the variation in line
strength of CaII at 3933.661 A, as a function of probe separation for a sample
of stars, including many sightlines in the Magellanic Clouds. Methods:
FLAMES-GIRAFFE data taken with the VLT towards early-type stars in 3 Galactic &
4 Magellanic open clusters in CaII are used to obtain the velocity, EW, column
density and line width of IS Galactic Ca for a total of 657 stars, of which 443
are Magellanic sightlines. In each cluster there are 43-110 stars observed.
Additionally, FEROS and UVES CaII & NaI spectra of 21 Galactic & 154 Magellanic
early-type stars are presented and combined with data from the literature to
study the Ca column density/parallax relationship. Results: For the four
Magellanic clusters studied with FLAMES, the strength of the Galactic IS CaII K
EW over transverse scales from 0.05-9 pc is found to vary by factors of
1.8-3.0, corresponding to column density variations of 0.3-0.5 dex in the
optically-thin approximation. Using FLAMES, FEROS and UVES archive spectra, the
min and max reduced EW for MW gas is found to lie in the range 35-125 mA &
30-160 mA for CaII K and NaI D, respectively. The range is consistent with a
simple model of the ISM published by van Loon et al. (2009) consisting of
spherical cloudlets of filling factor 0.3, although other geometries are not
ruled out. Finally, the derived functional form for parallax and CaII column
density is found to be pi(mas)=1/(2.39e-13 x N(CaII)(cm-2)+0.11). Our derived
parallax is 25 per cent lower than predicted by Megier et al. (2009) at a
distance of 100 pc and 15% lower at a distance of 200 pc, reflecting
inhomogeneity in the CaII distribution in the different sightlines studied.

each characterized by an initial short hard spike and a pulsating tail. The
observed pulsating tails are characterized by a duration of $\sim100\,\rm{s}$,
an isotropic energy of $\sim 10^{44}\,\rm{erg}$, and a pulse period of a few
seconds. The pulsating tail emission likely originates from the residual energy
after the intense energy release during the initial spike, which forms a
trapped fireball composed of a photon-pair plasma in a closed field line region
of the magnetars. Observationally the spectra of pulsating tails can be fitted
by the superposition of a thermal component and a power-law component, with the
thermal component dominating the emission in the early and late stages of the
pulsating tail observations. In this paper, assuming that the trapped fireball
is from a closed field line region in the magnetosphere, we calculate the
atmosphere structure of the optically-thick trapped fireball and the
polarization properties of the trapped fireball. By properly treating the
photon propagation in a hot, highly magnetized, electron-positron pair plasma,
we tally photons in two modes (O mode and E mode) at a certain observational
angle through Monte Carlo simulations. Our results suggest that the
polarization degree depends on the viewing angle with respect to the magnetic
axis of the magnetar, and can be as high as $\Pi\simeq30\%$ in the
$1-30\,\rm{keV}$ band, and $\Pi\simeq10\%$ in the $30-100\,\rm{keV}$ band, if
the line of sight is perpendicular to the magnetic axis.

IRIS detected large intensity enhancements of the Mg II h and k lines,
subordinate triplet lines, and several other metallic lines at the flare
footpoints during this flare. We have used the advantage of the slit-scanning
mode (rastering) of IRIS and performed, for the first time, a detailed analysis
of spatial and temporal variations of the spectra. Moreover, we were also able
to identify positions of strongest HXR emissions using RHESSI observations and
to correlate them with the spatial and temporal evolution of Mg II spectra. The
light curves of the Mg II lines increase and peak contemporarily with the HXR
emissions but decay more gradually. There are large red asymmetries in the Mg
II h and k lines after the flare peak. We see two spatially well separated
groups of Mg II line profiles, non-reversed and reversed. In some cases, the Mg
II footpoints with reversed profiles are correlated with HXR sources. We show
the spatial and temporal behavior of several other line parameters (line
metrics) and briefly discuss them. Finally, we have synthesized the Mg II k
line using our non-LTE code with the MALI technique. Two kinds of models are
considered, the flare model F2 of Machado et al. (1980) and the models of
Ricchiazzi and Canfield (1983). Model F2 reproduces the peak intensity of the
unreversed Mg II k profile at flare maximum but does not account for high wing
intensities. On the other hand, the RC models show the sensitivity of Mg II
line intensities to various electron-beam parameters. Our simulations also show
that the microturbulence produces a broader line core, while the intense line
wings are caused by an enhanced line source function.

probe technique at x-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) to ultimately unravel
ultrafast chemical and structural changes on a femtosecond time scale is often
challenging, due to the small signal rate in conventional implementations at
XFELs that rely on the usage of a monochromator set up to select a small
frequency band of the broadband, spectrally incoherent XFEL radiation. Here, we
suggest an alternative approach, based on stochastic spectroscopy, that uses
the full bandwidth of the incoming XFEL pulses. Our proposed method is relying
on stimulated resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, where in addition to a pump
pulse that resonantly excites the system a probe pulse on a specific electronic
inelastic transition is provided, that serves as seed in the stimulated
scattering process. The limited spectral coherence of the XFEL radiation
defines the energy resolution in this process and stimulated RIXS spectra of
high resolution can be obtained by covariance analysis of the transmitted
spectra. We present a detailed feasibility study and predict signal strengths

solving the equation of motion for the electronic and vibrational degrees of

levels of robustness, while minimizing the amount of resources for
coordination. Based on the observation that algorithms that avoid communication
are inherently robust, we analyze the best running time performance of
non-coordinating algorithms. Specifically, we devise non-coordinating
algorithms that achieve a speed-up of $9/8$ for two searchers, a speed-up of
$4/3$ for three searchers, and in general, a speed-up of $\frac{k}{4}(1+1/k)^2$
for any $k\geq 1$ searchers. Thus, asymptotically, the speed-up is only four
times worse compared to the case of full-coordination, and our algorithms are
surprisingly simple and hence applicable. Moreover, these bounds are tight in a
strong sense as no non-coordinating search algorithm can achieve better
speed-ups. Overall, we highlight that, in faulty contexts in which coordination
between the searchers is technically difficult to implement, intrusive with
respect to privacy, and/or costly in term of resources, it might well be worth
giving up on coordination, and simply run our non-coordinating exhaustive
search algorithms.

power-counting proposals in Effective Field Theories which are non-perturbative
at leading order. It uses the fact that the Renormalisation Group evolution of
an observable predicts the functional form of its residual cutoff dependence on
the EFT breakdown scale, low-momentum scales, and the order of the calculation.
Passing this test is a necessary but not sufficient consistency criterion for a
suggested power counting whose exact nature is disputed. For example, in ChiEFT
with more than one nucleon, a lack of universally accepted analytic solutions
obfuscates the relation between convergence pattern and numerical results, and
led to proposals which predict different numbers of Low Energy Coefficients at
the same chiral order. The method may provide an independent check whether an
observable is renormalised at a given order, and of both the breakdown scale
and the momentum-dependent order-by-order convergence pattern of an EFT.
Conversely, it may help identify LECs which produce renormalised observables at
a given order. I also discuss its underlying assumptions and relation to the RG
Equation; useful choices for observables and cutoffs; the momentum window in
which the test provides best signals; its dependence on the values and forms of
cutoffs as well as on the EFT parameters; the impact of fitting Low Energy
Coefficients to data in different or the same channel; caveats and limitations.
Since the test is designed to minimise the use of data, it allows one to
quantitatively falsify if the EFT has been renormalised consistently, rather
than quantifying how an EFT compares to experiment. Its application in
particular to the 3P0 and 3P2-3F2 partial waves of NN scattering in ChiEFT may
elucidate persistent power-counting issues. Details and a better bibliography
can be found in an upcoming publication.

densified pupil spectroscopy, allows us to perform high, stable
spectrophotometry against telescope pointing jitter and deformation of the

roles: division of a pupil into a number of sub-pupils, densification of each
sub-pupil, and acquisition of the spectrum of each sub-pupil with a
conventional spectrometer. Focusing on the fact that the divided and densified
sub-pupil can be treated as a point source, we discovered that a simplified
spectrometer allows us to acquire the spectra of the densified sub-pupils on
the detector plane-an optical conjugate with the primary mirror-by putting the
divided and densified sub-pupils on the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The
acquired multiple spectra are not principally moved on the detector against
low-order aberrations such as the telescope pointing jitter and any deformation
of the primary mirror. The reliability of the observation result is also
increased by statistically treating them. Our numerical calculations show that,
because this method suppresses the instrumental systematic errors down to 10
ppm under telescopes with modest pointing accuracy, next-generation space
telescopes with more than 2.5m diameter potentially provide opportunities to
characterize temperate super-Earths around nearby late-type stars through the
transmission spectroscopy and secondary eclipse.

(PFM) is supposed to substitute field cooling (FC) to provide in situ

is important to provide optimal magnetization strategies. In this paper, HTS
bulks magnetized by PFM are simulated with an axisymmetric
electromagnetic-thermal coupled model based on H-formulation. Influences of
important yet difficult-to-characterize parameters of HTS bulks including n
values in the E-J Power Law and B0 in the Kim's Law are investigated.
Furthermore, controlled magnetic density distribution coils (CMDCs) which
generate a non-uniform field are suggested to further improve the trapped field

that uses the natural solar wind momentum flux for spacecraft propulsion with
the help of long, charged, centrifugally stretched tethers. The problem of
accurately predicting the E-sail thrust is still somewhat open, however, due to
a possible electron population trapped by the tether. Here we develop a new
type of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation for predicting E-sail thrust. In the
new simulation, electrons are modelled as a fluid, hence resembling hydrid
simulation, but in contrast to normal hybrid simulation, the Poisson equation
is used as in normal PIC to calculate the self-consistent electrostatic field.
For electron-repulsive parts of the potential, the Boltzmann relation is used.
For electron-attractive parts of the potential we employ a power law which
contains a parameter that can be used to control the number of trapped
electrons. We perform a set of runs varying the parameter and select the one
with the smallest number of trapped electrons which still behaves in a
physically meaningful way in the sense of producing not more than one solar
wind ion deflection shock upstream of the tether. By this prescription we
obtain thrust per tether length values that are in line with earlier estimates,
although somewhat smaller. We conclude that the Boltzmann PIC simulation is a
new tool for simulating the E-sail thrust. This tool enables us to calculate
solutions rapidly and allows to easily study different scenarios for trapped
electrons.

rather than on the overall sample. Rubin (1998) put forth such a method, and
argued that testing for the complier average causal effect and averaging
permutation based p-values over the posterior distribution of the compliance
status could increase power, as compared to general intent-to-treat tests. The
general scheme is to repeatedly do a two-step process of imputing missing
compliance statuses and conducting a permutation test with the completed data.
In this paper, we explore this idea further, comparing the use of discrepancy
measures, which depend on unknown but imputed parameters, to classical test
statistics and exploring different approaches for imputing the unknown
compliance statuses. We also examine consequences of model misspecification in
the imputation step, and discuss to what extent this additional modeling
undercuts the permutation test's model independence. We find that, especially
for discrepancy measures, modeling choices can impact both power and validity.
In particular, imputing missing compliance statuses assuming the null can
radically reduce power, but not doing so can jeopardize validity. Fortunately,
covariates predictive of compliance status can mitigate these results. Finally,
we compare this overall approach to Bayesian model-based tests, that is tests
that are directly derived from posterior credible intervals, under both correct
and incorrect model specification. We find that adding the permutation step in
an otherwise Bayesian approach improves robustness to model specification
without substantial loss of power.

it in three dimensions, where it is closely related to QED and other models
used to describe properties of graphene. In addition it is a good toy model to
study chiral symmetry breaking, since a phase with broken chiral symmetry is
present for the model with one fermion flavour. On the other hand, there is no
such phase in the limit of infinitely many fermion flavours. Thus, a transition
at some critical flavour number Nfc is expected, where the broken phase
vanishes. The model was already studied with different methods, including
Schwinger-Dyson, functional renormalization group and lattice approaches. Most
studies agree that there is indeed a phase transition from a chirally symmetric
phase to a spontaneously broken phase for a small number of fermion flavours.
But there is no agreement on the critical flavour number and further details of
the critical behaviour. Values of Nfc found in the literature usually range
between 2 and 7. All earlier lattice studies were performed with staggered
fermions, where it is questionable if the continuum limit of the lattice model
has the same chiral symmetry as the continuum model. We present an approach for
simulations of the Thirring model with SLAC fermions. With this choice, we can
be sure to implement the full chiral symmetry of the continuum model. First
results from simulations are shown but do not allow a reliable estimate of Nfc

latitude as a function of rigidity were studied on relatively short timescales,
corresponding to single spacecraft orbits (about 94 minutes). Estimated cutoff
values were cross-checked with those obtained by means of a trajectory tracing
approach based on dynamical empirical modeling of the Earth's magnetosphere. We
find significant variations in the cutoff latitude, with a maximum suppression
of about 6 deg for $\sim$80 MeV protons during the main phase of the storm. The
observed reduction in the geomagnetic shielding and its temporal evolution were
compared with the changes in the magnetosphere configuration, investigating the

spectra of foreground polarized emissions in 352 circular sky patches located

of about 1.5%. We make use of the spectral properties derived from Planck and
WMAP data to extrapolate, in frequency, the amplitude of synchrotron and
thermal dust B-modes spectra in the multipole bin centered at $\ell\simeq80$.
In this way we estimate, for each analyzed region, the amplitude and frequency
of the foreground minimum. We detect both dust and synchrotron signal, at
degree angular scale and at 3 confidence level, in 28 regions. Here the minimum
of the foreground emission is found at frequencies between 60 and 100 GHz with
an amplitude,expressed in terms of the equivalent tensor-to-scalar ratio, r_FG,
between ~0.06 and ~1. Some of these regions are located at high Galactic
latitudes, in areas close to the ones which are being observed by sub-orbital
experiments.In all the other sky patches, where synchrotron or dust B-modes are
not detectable with the required confidence, we put upper limits on the minimum
foreground contamination and find values of r_FG between ~0.05 and ~1.5, in the
frequency range 60-90 GHz. Our results indicate that, with the current
sensitivity at low frequency, it is not possible to exclude the presence of
synchrotron contamination to CMB cosmological B-modes at the level requested to
measure a gravitational waves signal with r~0.01, at frequency <100 GHz,
anywhere. Therefore, more accurate data are essential in order to better
characterize the synchrotron polarized component, and eventually, remove its

been reported to be experiencing a fast orbital period decay, which is two
orders of magnitude higher than expected with gravitational wave radiation.
Magnetic braking of an Ap/Bp star has been suggested to account for the period
change when the surface magnetic field of the companion star $B_{\rm s}\ga
10^{4}$ G. However, our calculation indicates that anomalous magnetic braking
cannot significantly contribute to the large orbital period decay rates
observed in these two sources even if $B_{\rm s}\ga 10^{4}$ G. Observations
have provided evidence that circumbinary disks around two compact black hole
X-ray binaries may exist. Our analysis shows that, for some reasonable
parameters, tidal torque between the circumbinary disk and the binary can
efficiently extract the orbital angular momentum from the binary, and result in
a large orbital period change rate. Based on the circumbinary disk model, we
simulate the evolution of XTE J 1118+480 via a stellar evolution code. Our
computations are approximatively in agreement with the observed data (the
masses of two components, donor star radius, orbital period, and orbital period
derivative). The mass transfer rate and circumbinary disk mass are obviously
far greater than the inferred values from observations. Therefore, it seems
that the circumbinary disk is unlikely to be the main cause of the rapid
orbital decay observed in some compact black hole X-ray binaries.

computational task. Recently, it has been proposed that efficient stochastic

to run such models on massively parallel, low-power neuromorphic hardware holds
great promise; however, previously proposed networks are based on
probabilistically spiking neurons, and thus rely on random number generators or
external noise sources to achieve the necessary stochasticity, leading to
significant overhead in the implementation. Here we show how stochasticity can
be achieved by implementing deterministic models of integrate and fire neurons
using subthreshold analog circuits that are affected by thermal noise. We
present an efficient implementation of spike-based CSP solvers using a
reconfigurable neural network VLSI device, and the device's intrinsic noise as
a source of randomness. To illustrate the overall concept, we implement a
generic Sudoku solver based on our approach and demonstrate its operation. We

stars spin down, acquired by constructing color-period diagrams (CPDs) for a
series of open clusters. Our main aims here are to construct a CPD for M 48, to
compare this with other clusters of similar age to check for consistency, and
to derive a rotational age for M 48 using gyrochronology. We monitored M 48
photometrically for over 2 months with AIP's STELLA I 1.2 m telescope and the
WiFSIP 4K imager in Tenerife. Light curves with 3 mmag precision for bright
(V~14 mag) stars were produced and then analysed to provide rotation periods. A
cluster CPD has then been constructed. We report 62 rotation periods for cool
stars in M 48. The CPD displays a clear slow/I-sequence of rotating stars,
similar to those seen in the 625 Myr-old Hyades and 590 Myr-old Praesepe
clusters, and below both, confirming that M 48 is younger. A similar comparison
with the 250 Myr-old M 34 cluster shows that M 48 is older and does not possess
any fast/C-sequence G or early K stars like those in M 34, although relatively
fast rotators do seem to be present among the late-K and M stars. A more
detailed comparison of the CPD with rotational evolution models shows that the
cluster stars have a mean age of 450 Myr, and its (rotating) stars can be
individually dated to +-117 Myr (26%). Much of this uncertainty stems from
intrinsic astrophysical spread in initial periods, and almost all stars are
consistent with a single age of 450 Myr. The gyro-age of M 48 as a whole is
450+-50 Myr, in agreement with the previously determined isochrone age of
400+-100 Myr.

The measurement of ionization cooling in MICE relies on the selection of a pure

Muon Beam is designed to deliver a beam of muons with less than $\sim$1\%
contamination. To make the final muon selection, MICE employs a
particle-identification (PID) system upstream and downstream of the cooling
cell. The PID system includes time-of-flight hodoscopes, threshold-Cherenkov
counters and calorimetry. The upper limit for the pion contamination measured
in this paper is $f_\pi < 1.4\%$ at 90\% C.L., including systematic
uncertainties. Therefore, the MICE Muon Beam is able to meet the stringent

summing over fields in the spectrum. In field theory, the total partition
function splits in a natural way in a piece that does not contain surface terms
and a piece consisting of solely the so-called edge states. For open strings,
we illustrate that surface contributions to the higher spin fields correspond
to open strings piercing the Rindler origin, unifying the higher spin surface
contributions in string language. For closed strings, we demonstrate that the
string partition function is not quite the same as the sum over the partition
functions of the fields in the spectrum: an infinite overcounting is present
for the latter. Next we study the partition functions obtained by excluding the
surface terms. Using recent results of JHEP 1505 (2015) 106, this construction,
first done by Emparan, can be put on much firmer ground. We generalize to type
II and heterotic superstrings and demonstrate modular invariance. All of these
exhibit an IR divergence that can be interpreted as a maximal acceleration
close to the black hole horizon. Ultimately, since these partition functions
are only part of the full story, divergences here should not be viewed as a
failure of string theory: maximal acceleration is a feature of a faulty
treatment of the higher spin fields in the string spectrum. We comment on the
relevance of this to Solodukhin's recent proposal. A possible link with the
firewall paradox is apparent.

architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core
trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding
decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture
of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional
layers in the VGG16 network. The role of the decoder network is to map the low
resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for
pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which
the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically,
the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the
corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the
need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then
convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our
proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN and also with the well known
DeepLab-LargeFOV, DeconvNet architectures. This comparison reveals the memory
versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance.
  SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it
is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time
during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable
parameters than other competing architectures. We also performed a controlled
benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D
indoor scene segmentation tasks. We show that SegNet provides good performance
with competitive inference time and more efficient inference memory-wise as
compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of

a necessary and sufficient condition under which the fixed-rate Raptor code
ensemble exhibits a strictly positive typical minimum distance. The condition
involves the rate of the outer code, the rate of the inner fixed-rate Luby

shown that for ensembles fulfilling this condition, the minimum distance of a
code randomly drawn from the ensemble has a linear growth with the block

recombination energy and band gap is nonlinear and the slopes are different

eight-band k.p method, their variation for different QD sizes are surveyed, and
recombination energies of the discrete levels are determined. Then, by
representing a three-level InAs/GaAs QD laser, dynamics of such a laser device
is numerically studied by rate equations in which homogeneous and inhomogeneous
broadenings are taken into account. The lasing process for both Ground State

was observed that in larger QDs, photon number and bandwidth of the small
signal modulation decrease but turn-on delay, maximum output power, and
threshold current of gain increase. It was also found that for a good
modulation, smaller QDs, and form the point of view of high-power applications,

the wave packets. We assume that the wave packet is a possible model of
particle . When studying the behaviour of the wave packet for standing waves,
in relation to an accelerated observer (i.e. Rindler observer), there can be
demonstrated that the equivalent mass of the packet is the inertial mass. In
our scenario, the waves and of the wave packets are depicted by the strain
induced/produced in the medium. The properties of the waves, of the wave packet
and, generally, of the perturbations in a material medium suggest the existence
of an acoustic world. The acoustic world has mechanical and thermodynamical
properties. The perturbations that are generated and propagated in the medium
are correlated by means of acoustic waves with maximum speed. The observers of
this world of disturbances (namely the acoustic world) have senses that are
based on the perception of mechanical waves (disturbance of any kind) and
apparatus for detecting and acquiring information by means of the same type of
wave. Time and length measurements (and other parameters) are correlated by
Lorentz type transformations, where the maximum speed is the speed of the sound
waves. By applying these transformations to the packet of standing waves, there
results that the energy, mass, linear momentum and the action variable/variable
action undergo relativistic changes. We highlight the fact that the dynamic
relativist relationship between energy and momentum is a consequence of the
wave packet model for a particle. We have also emphasized the existence of
certain limits for the energy of the disturbance and the corresponding action
