the axis of the torus in a semiclassical quantization framework. We exploit the
Einstein - Brillouin - Keller (EBK) scheme of quantization that is appropriate
for multidimensional systems. Embedding of the knot on a specific torus is
inherently two dimensional that gives rise to two quantization conditions. This
shows that although the system, after imposing the knot condition reduces to a
one dimensional system, even then it has manifest non-planar features which
shows up again in the study of fractional angular momentum. Finally we compare
the results obtained from EBK (multi-dimensional) and Bohr-Sommerfeld (single

knot parameters that specifies its non-planar features. Interestingly, we show
that there can be non-planar corrections to the planar anyon-like fractional

view of topological phase transition (TPT), the non-trivial topology of
electron bands in TMDs is caused by the band inversion between metal d and
chalcogen p orbital bands, where the former is pulled down below the latter.
Here, we show that, in TMDs, the TPT is entirely different from the
conventional speculation. In particular, MS2 and MSe2 exhibits the opposite
behavior of TPT, such that the chalcogen p orbital band moves down below the
metal d orbital band. More interestingly, in MTe2, the band inversion occurs
between the metal d orbital bands. Our findings cast doubts on the common view
of TPT and provide clear guidelines for understanding the topological nature in
new topological materials to be discovered.

study natural parameter asymptotics and regularizing properties of the

of pentaquark states with charmonium. To understand the structure of the
states, a dynamical calculation of 5-quark systems with quantum numbers
$IJ^P=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2})^\pm$, $\frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2})^\pm$ and
$\frac{1}{2}(\frac{5}{2})^\pm$ is performed in the framework of chiral quark
model with the help of gaussian expansion method. The results show that the
negative parity states can be bound states while all of the positive parity
states are the scattering states. The $P_c(4380)$ state is suggested to be the
bound state of $\Sigma^*_cD$. Although the energy of $\Sigma_cD^*$ is very
close to the mass of $P_c(4450)$, the inconsistent parity prevents the
assignment. The calculated distances between quarks confirm the molecular
nature of the states. Other five-quark bound states of the combination of
$\Sigma_cD$ and $\Sigma^*_cD^*$ are also found in the region about 4.3GeV and
4.5GeV.

a novel approach that can assist in mitigating this challenge. This approach
can collect Cloud infrastructure information from an outside Cloud client along
with workflow provenance and can establish a mapping between them. This mapping

The reproducibility of the workflow execution is performed by: (a) capturing

the workflow provenance, (b) re-provisioning the similar resources on the Cloud
and re-executing the workflow on them and (c) by comparing the outputs of
workflows. The evaluation of the prototype suggests that the proposed approach
is feasible and can be investigated further. Moreover, there is no reference

genetic elements, endosymbionts, or culture) is widespread among living
organisms. Yet current ecological and evolutionary theory addressing HT is
limited. We present a modeling framework for the dynamics of two populations
that compete for resources and exchange horizontally (transfer) an otherwise
vertically inherited trait. Competition influences individual demographics,
affecting population size, which feeds back on the dynamics of transfer. We
capture this feedback with a stochastic individual-based model, from which we
derive a deterministic approximation for large populations. The interaction
between horizontal transfer and competition makes possible the stable (or
bi-stable) polymorphic maintenance of deleterious traits (including costly
plasmids). When transfer rates are of a general density-dependent form,
transfer stochasticity contributes strongly to population fluctuations. For an
initially rare trait, we describe the probabilistic dynamics of invasion and
fixation. Acceleration of fixation by HT is faster when competition is weak in
the resident population. Thus, HT can have a major impact on the distribution
of mutational effects that are fixed, and our model provides a basis for a
general theory of the influence of HT on eco-evolutionary dynamics and
adaptation.

voltage regulators has been identified as a promising technique for efficient

offer low voltage operation, faster transient response, and higher current
efficiency. Response time as well as output voltage ripple can be reduced by
increasing the speed of the dynamic comparators. However, the comparator offset
steeply increases for high clock frequencies, thereby leading to enhanced
variations in output voltage. In this work we explore the design of digital
LDOs with multiple dynamic comparators that can overcome this bottleneck. In
the proposed topology, we apply time-interleaved comparators with the same
voltage threshold and uniform current step in order to accomplish the
aforementioned features. Simulation based analysis shows that the DLDO with
time-interleaved comparators can achieve better overall performance in terms of
current efficiency, ripple and settling time. For a load step of 50mA, a DLDO
with 8 time-interleaved comparators could achieve an output ripple of less than
5mV, while achieving a settling time of less than 0.5us. Load current dependant

tuning, it may well make the underlying theory simpler as illustrated with one
example. Direct production of new particles heavier than about 5 TeV becomes
very difficult at LHC though indirect signals such as deviations in the Higgs
to gamma gamma branching ratio may still be possible. Also of course precision
studies at low energy facilities can be useful for detecting new phenomena. For
direct production of new particles over 5-10 TeV a new high energy collider
perhaps at 100 TeV is highly desirable. Indeed, a very strong physics case can
be made for such a machine. It can be used to significantly improve many bounds
as well as allow a multitude of direct searches in many channels without

subdiffusion parameters of both the media into the Green's functions. Finally,
placing $R_1=R_2=0$ into the obtained functions we get the Green's functions
for the composite membrane system without any reactions. From the obtained
Green's functions, we derive the boundary conditions at the thin membrane. One
of the boundary conditions contains the Riemann--Liouville fractional time
derivative, which shows that the additional `memory effect' is created in the
system. As is discussed in this paper, the `memory effect' can be created both
by the membrane and by the discontinuity of the medium at the point at which
the various media are joined.

suggested to result in the formation of a spreading layer (SL) - a belt-like
structure on the object's surface, in which the accreted matter steadily
spreads in the poleward (meridional) direction while spinning down. To assess
its basic characteristics we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
of supersonic SLs in the relevant morphology with a simple prescription for
cooling. We demonstrate that supersonic shear naturally present at the base of
the SL inevitably drives sonic instability that gives rise to large scale
acoustic modes governing the evolution of the SL. These modes dominate the
transport of momentum and energy, which is intrinsically global and cannot be
characterized via some form of local effective viscosity (e.g.
$\alpha$-viscosity). The global nature of the wave-driven transport should have
important implications for triggering Type I X-ray bursts in low mass X-ray
binaries. The nonlinear evolution of waves into a system of shocks drives
effective re-arrangement (sensitively depending on thermodynamical properties
of the flow) and deceleration of the SL, which ultimately becomes transonic and
susceptible to regular Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We interpret this
evolution in terms of the global structure of the SL and suggest that mixing of
the SL material with the underlying stellar fluid should become effective only
at intermediate latitudes on the accreting object's surface, where the flow has
decelerated appreciably. In the near-equatorial regions the transport is
dominated by acoustic waves and mixing is less efficient. We speculate that
this latitudinal non-uniformity of mixing in accreting white dwarfs may be
linked to the observed bipolar morphology of classical novae ejecta.

addressing network security breaches. Even with the increasing sophistication
of network attacks, basic network events such as connections between two IP
addresses play an important role in any network defense. Given the duration of
current attacks, long-term data archival is critical but typically very little
of the data is ever accessed. Previous work has provided tools and identified
the need to trace connections. However, traditional databases raise performance
concerns as they are optimized for querying rather than ingestion.
  The study of write-optimized data structures (WODS) is a new and growing
field that provides a novel approach to traditional storage structures (e.g.,
B-trees). WODS trade minor degradations in query performance for significant
gains in the ability to quickly insert more data elements, typically on the
order of 10 to 100 times more inserts per second. These efficient,
out-of-memory data structures can play a critical role in enabling robust,
long-term tracking of network events.
  In this paper, we present TWIAD, the Write-optimized IP Address Database.
TWIAD uses a write-optimized B-tree known as a B {\epsilon} tree to track all
IP address connections in a network traffic stream. Our initial implementation
focuses on utilizing lower cost hardware, demonstrating that basic long-term
tracking can be done without advanced equipment. We tested TWIAD on a modest
desktop system and showed a sustained ingestion rate of about 20,000 inserts
per second.

today the sole method to scrutinize the distribution and dynamical behavior of
the ultra energetic electrons magnetically trapped around the planet (because
in-situ particle data are limited in the inner magnetosphere). Aims. We perform
the first resolved and low-frequency imaging of the synchrotron emission with
LOFAR at 127 MHz. The radiation comes from low energy electrons (~1-30 MeV)
which map a broad region of Jupiter's inner magnetosphere. Methods (see article
for complete abstract) Results. The first resolved images of Jupiter's
radiation belts at 127-172 MHz are obtained along with total integrated flux
densities. They are compared with previous observations at higher frequencies
and show a larger extent of the synchrotron emission source (>=4 $R_J$). The
asymmetry and the dynamic of east-west emission peaks are measured and the
presence of a hot spot at lambda_III=230 {\deg} $\pm$ 25 {\deg}. Spectral flux
density measurements are on the low side of previous (unresolved) ones,
suggesting a low-frequency turnover and/or time variations of the emission
spectrum. Conclusions. LOFAR is a powerful and flexible planetary imager. The
observations at 127 MHz depict an extended emission up to ~4-5 planetary radii.
The similarities with high frequency results reinforce the conclusion that: i)
the magnetic field morphology primarily shapes the brightness distribution of
the emission and ii) the radiating electrons are likely radially and
latitudinally distributed inside about 2 $R_J$. Nonetheless, the larger extent
of the brightness combined with the overall lower flux density, yields new
information on Jupiter's electron distribution, that may shed light on the
origin and mode of transport of these particles.

to a set of queries, such that querying the (small) coreset provably yields an
approximate answer to querying the original (full) dataset. In the last decade,
coresets provided breakthroughs in theoretical computer science for
approximation algorithms, and more recently, in the machine learning community
for learning ""Big data"". However, we are not aware of real-time systems that
compute coresets in a rate of dozens of frames per second. In this paper we
suggest a framework to turn theorems to such systems using coresets. We begin
with a proof of independent interest, that any set of $n$ matrices in
$\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ whose sum is $S$, has a positively weighted subset
whose sum has the same center of mass (mean) and orientation (left+right
singular vectors) as $S$, and consists of $O(dr)$ matrices (independent of
$n$), where $r\leq d$ is the rank of $S$. We provide an algorithm that computes
this (core) set in one pass over possibly infinite stream of matrices in
$d^{O(1)}$ time per matrix insertion. By maintaining such a coreset for
kinematic (moving) set of $n$ points, we can run pose-estimation algorithms,
such as Kabsch or PnP, on the small coresets, instead of the $n$ points, in
real-time using weak devices, while obtaining the same results. This enabled us
to implement a low-cost ($<\$100$) IoT wireless system that tracks a toy (and
harmless) quadcopter which guides guests to a desired room (in a hospital,
mall, hotel, museum, etc.) with no help of additional human or remote
controller. We hope that our framework will encourage researchers outside the
theoretical community to design and use coresets in future systems and papers.
To this end, we provide extensive experimental results on both synthetic and
real data, as well as a link to the open code of our system and algorithms.

understand the influence of the buckling amplitude on the morphology of the
X-shape, we analyze three self-consistent numerical simulations of barred
galaxies with different buckling amplitudes (strong, intermediate and weak). We
derive the three-dimensional density with an adaptive kernel smoothing
technique. The face-on iso-density surfaces are all elliptical, while in the
edge-on view, the morphology of buckled bars transitions with increasing
radius, from a central boxy core to a peanut bulge and then to an extended thin
bar. Based on these iso-density surfaces at different density levels, we find
no clear evidence for a well-defined structure shaped like a letter X. The
X-shaped structure is more peanut-like, whose visual perception is probably
enhanced by the pinched inner concave iso-density contours. The peanut bulge
can reproduce qualitatively the observed bimodal distributions which were used
as evidence for the discovery of the X-shape. The central boxy core is shaped
like an oblong tablet, extending to $\sim$ 500 pc above and below the Galactic
plane ($|b| \sim 4^\circ$). From the solar perspective, lines of sight passing
through the central boxy core do not show bimodal distributions. This generally
agrees with the observations that the double peaks merge at $|b| \sim 4^\circ -
5^\circ$ from the Galactic plane, indicating the presence of a possibly similar
structure in the Galactic bulge.

CNN. Cascaded CNN contains two levels of convolutional networks. Multiple CNNs
at level 1 deal with aspect mapping task, and a single CNN at level 2 deals

optical color (g-r) , surface stellar mass density ($\mu_{\star}$) and central
stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\star}$). For each subsample we measure
both the projected cross-correlation function ($w_{p}(r_{p})$) relative to a
reference galaxy sample, and an average mass of the host dark matter halos
($M_{halo}$) . For comparison we have also estimated the $w_{p}(r_{p})$ for the
full galaxy population and the subset of satellite galaxies. We find that, for
central galaxies, both $w_{p}(r_{p})$ and $M_{halo}$ show strongest dependence
on $M_{\star}$, and there is no clear dependence on other properties when
stellar mass is fixed. This result provides strong support to the
previously-adopted assumption that, for central galaxies, stellar mass is the
galaxy property that is best indicative of the host dark halo mass. The full
galaxy population and the subset of satellites show similar clustering
properties in all cases. However, they are similar to the centrals only at high
masses ($M_{\star} \geq 10^{11} M_{\odot}$). At low-mass ($M_{\star} \leq
10^{11} M_{\odot}$), the results are different: the $w_{p}(r_{p})$ increases
with both $\sigma$ and g-r when $M_{\star}$ is fixed, and depends very weakly
on $M_{\star}$ when $\sigma_{\star}$ or g-r is fixed. At fixed $M_{star}$, the
$\mu_{\star}$ shows weak correlations with clustering amplitude (and halo mass
for central galaxies). Our results suggest that it is necessary to consider
central and satellite galaxies separately when studying the link between

vanishing on the horizon, so that the equivalence principle is exactly

Here we
investigate FRB121102, detected at Arecibo telescope and remarkable for its
unusually large spectral index. After extensive study we conclude that the
spectral index is caused by a nebula with free-free absorption. We find that
putative nebula must lie beyond the Milky Way. We conclude that FRBs are of
extra-galactic origin and that they arise in dense star-forming regions. The
challenge with extra-galactic models is the the high volumetric rate of FRBs.
This high rate allows us to eliminate all models of catastrophic stellar
deaths. Hyper-giant flares from young magnetars emerge as the most likely
progenitors. Some of the consequences are: (i) Intergalactic FRB models can be
safely ignored. (ii) The rich ISM environment of young magnetars can result in
significant contribution to DM, Rotation Measure (RM) and in some cases to
significant free-free optical depth. (iii) The star-forming regions in the host
galaxies can contribute significantly to the DM. Including this contribution
reduces the inferred distances to FRBs and correspondingly increases the
volumetric rate of FRBs (and, in turn, may require that giant flares can also
produce FRBs). (iv) FRBs are likely to be suppressed at lower frequencies.
Conversely, searching for FRBs at higher frequencies (2-5 GHz) would be
attractive. (v) The blast wave which produces the radio emission can undergo
rapid deceleration if the circum-burst medium is dense (as maybe the case for
FRB121102), leading to X-ray, radio and possibly gamma-ray emission. (vi)
Galaxies with high star formation rate host will have a higher FRB rate.
However, such FRBs will have differing DMs owing to differing local
contributions. (vi) The DM and RM of FRBs will prove to be noisy probes of the
intergalactic medium (density, magnetic field) and cosmography.

is proposed based on the difference between IYRs. $T_{IB}$ obtained from
isobars in different reactions will be compared. \item[Methods] The yields of
three isobars are employed in $T_{IB}$. The residual free energy of the three
isobars are replaced by that of the binding energy. No secondary decay
modification for odd $A$ fragment is used in $T_{IB}$. \item[Results] The
measured fragment yields in the 140$A$ MeV $^{40, 48}$Ca + $^{9}$Be
($^{181}$Ta) and $^{58, 64}$Ni + $^9$Be ($^{181}$Ta), the 1$A$ GeV $^{124,
136}$Xe + Pb, and the $^{112,124}$Sn + $^{112,124}$Sn reactions have been
analyzed to obtain $T_{IB}$ from IMFs. $T_{IB}$ from most of the fragments in
the $^{40, 48}$Ca and $^{58, 64}$Ni reactions is in the range of 0.6 MeV $ <
T_{IB} < $ 3.5 MeV. $T_{IB}$ from most of the fragments in the $^{124}$Xe and
$^{112,124}$Sn reactions is in the range of 0.5 MeV $ < T_{IB} < $ 2.5 MeV,
while the range is 0.5 MeV $ < T_{IB} <$ 4 MeV from most of the fragments in
the $^{136}$Xe reaction. In general, for most of the fragments $T_{IB}$ in the
$^{40, 48}$Ca and $^{58, 64}$Ni reactions are very similar (except in the very
neutron-rich fragments), and $T_{IB}$ from IMFs in the $^{124, 136}$Xe and
$^{112,124}$Sn reactions is also similar. A slightly dependence of $T_{IB}$ on
$A$ is found. \item[Conclusions] Using the binding energy of the nucleus,
$T_{IB}$ can be obtained without the knowledge of the free energies of
fragments. In the investigated reactions, $T_{IB}$ from most of the IMFs is
low.

simulation of autonomous quantum dynamics for disordered Heisenberg chains when
the system is prepared with an initial inhomogeneity in the energy density

surprisingly, the breakdown of energy diffusion even before the many-body
localization transition whilst the system is still in the ergodic phase.
Moreover, in the ergodic phase we also find a large region in parameter space
where the energy dynamics remains diffusive but where spin transport has been
previously evidenced to occur only subdiffusively: this is found to be true for
initial states composed of infinitely many hydrodynamic modes (square-wave
energy profile) or just the single longest mode (sinusoidal profile). This
suggestive finding points towards a peculiar ergodic phase where particles are
transported slower than energy, reminiscent of the situation in amorphous
solids and of the gapped phase of the anisotropic Heisenberg model.

Inflationary models make specific, quantitative predictions for several

physics include many scalar fields at high energies. Moreover, we may expect
these fields to have nonminimal couplings to the spacetime curvature. Such
couplings are quite generic, arising as renormalization counterterms when
quantizing scalar fields in curved spacetime. In this chapter I review recent
research on a general class of multifield inflationary models with nonminimal
couplings. Models in this class exhibit a strong attractor behavior: across a
wide range of couplings and initial conditions, the fields evolve along a
single-field trajectory for most of inflation. Across large regions of phase
space and parameter space, therefore, models in this general class yield robust
predictions for observable quantities that fall squarely within the ""sweet

understand the natural and human network designs in real situations and to

camera views, known as person re-identification. Variations in lighting
conditions, environment and pose changes across camera views make
re-identification a challenging problem. Previous methods address these
challenges by designing specific features or by learning a distance function.
We propose a hierarchical feature learning framework that learns invariant
representations from labeled image pairs. A mapping is learned such that the
extracted features are invariant for images belonging to same individual across
views. To learn robust representations and to achieve better generalization to
unseen data, the system has to be trained with a large amount of data.
Critically, most of the person re-identification datasets are small. Manually
augmenting the dataset by partial corruption of input data introduces
additional computational burden as it requires several training epochs to
converge. We propose a hierarchical network which incorporates a
marginalization technique that can reap the benefits of training on large
datasets without explicit augmentation. We compare our approach with several
baseline algorithms as well as popular linear and non-linear metric learning
algorithms and demonstrate improved performance on challenging publicly
available datasets, VIPeR, CUHK01, CAVIAR4REID and iLIDS. Our approach also
achieves the stateof-the-art results on these datasets.

magnetic order can induce superconducting pairing. The intertwining of the two
on the microscopic level, independent of lattice excitations, is especially
pronounced in heavy fermion compounds, rare earth cuprates, and iron pnictides.
Here we point out that for a helical arrangement of localized spins, a variable
magnetic pitch length provides a unique tuning process from ferromagnetic to
antiferromagnetic ground state in the long and short wavelength limits,
respectively. Such chemical or pressure adjustable helical order naturally
provides the possibility for continuous tuning between ferromagnetically and
antiferromagnetically mediated superconductivity. At the same time, phonon
mediated superconductivity is suppressed because of the local ferromagnetic
spin configuration. We employ synchrotron-based magnetic x-ray diffraction
techniques to test these ideas in the recently discovered superconductor, MnP.
This sensitive probe directly reveals a reduced-moment, helical spin order at
high pressure proximate to the superconducting state, with a tightened pitch in
comparison to that at ambient pressure where superconductivity is absent. The
correlation between magnetic pitch length and superconducting transition
temperature in the (Cr/Mn/Fe)(P/As) family suggests a strategy for using spiral
magnets as interlocutors for spin fluctuation mediated superconductivity.

to testable consequences, including the expectation that hot Jupiters should
frequently be accompanied by additional low-mass planets with periods shorter

increase the inclinations of such companions, rendering transits rare.

species composition in a community. In the PA model, species are treated as
stochastic binary variables that can either be present or absent in a
community: species can immigrate into the community from a regional species
pool and can go extinct due to competition and stochasticity. Despite its
simplicity, the PA model reproduces the qualitative features of more
complicated models of community assembly. In agreement with recent work on
large, competitive Lotka-Volterra systems, the PA model exhibits distinct
ecological behaviors organized around a special (""critical"") point

ubiquitous in several areas such as approximation theory, random matrix models,
theoretical physics and in numerical analysis, to mention a few. Due to the
freedom in the choice of the integration contour for such polynomials, the
location of their zeros is a priori not clear. Nevertheless, numerical
experiments, such as those presented in this paper, show that the zeros not
simply cluster somewhere on the plane, but persistently choose to align on
certain curves, and in a very regular fashion.
  The problem of the limit zero distribution for the non-hermitian orthogonal
polynomials is one of the central aspects of their theory. Several important
results in this direction have been obtained, especially in the last 30 years,
and describing them is one of the goals of the first parts of this paper.
However, the general theory is far from being complete, and many natural
questions remain unanswered or have only a partial explanation.
  Thus, the second motivation of this paper is to discuss some ""mysterious""
configurations of zeros of polynomials, defined by an orthogonality condition
with respect to a sum of exponential functions on the plane, that appeared as a
results of our numerical experiments. In this apparently simple situation the
zeros of these orthogonal polynomials may exhibit different behaviors: for some
of them we state the rigorous results, while other are presented as conjectures
(apparently, within a reach of modern techniques). Finally, there are cases for
which it is not yet clear how to explain our numerical results, and where we
cannot go beyond an empirical discussion.

helicity of initial state $b$-quark and final state $s$-quark must be flipped
in $B\to X_{s}\gamma$, which corresponds to the simultaneous breaking of chiral
symmetry and electroweak symmetry. The common feature is shared by fermion mass
generation. Same as radiative mass generation in MSSM, Peccei-Quinn and $R$
symmetry breaking contributions, for example from a Higgsino-stop loop when
$\mu A_t<0$, may significantly cancel the contribution from charged Higgs and
reduce the prediction of $B\to X_{s}\gamma$. For the latter process, including
Babu-Kolda FCNC proportional to $\mu A_t$, $B_{s}\to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ is
mediated by a scalar $H_d$ boson which corresponds to chiral symmetry breaking.
In addition, as a result of interference among the Higgs extension sector and
$Z$ contributions, in the region of $\mu A_t <0$ which is favored by $B\to

functional study, but contact prediction from sequence information remains very
challenging. Recently evolutionary coupling (EC) analysis, which predicts
contacts by detecting co-evolved residues (or columns) in a multiple sequence
alignment (MSA), has made good progress due to better statistical assessment
techniques and high-throughput sequencing. Existing EC analysis methods predict
only a single contact map for a given protein, which may have low accuracy
especially when the protein under prediction does not have a large number of
sequence homologs. Analogous to ab initio folding that usually predicts a few
possible 3D models for a given protein sequence, this paper presents a novel
structure learning method that can predict a set of diverse contact maps for a
given protein sequence, in which the best solution usually has much better

and play important roles in electron transport. However, due to the lack of
effective quantum transport method to do disorder average, the important
effects of disorders remain largely un-explored or poorly understood. Here, we
report a generalized non-equilibrium vertex correction method with coherent
potential approximation for the non-equilibrium quantum transport simulation of
disordered nanoelectronics. In this method, the disorder average of various
Green's functions are computed by a generalized coherent potential
approximation. A generalized non-equilibrium vertex correction algorithm is
then developed to calculate disorder average of the product of any two real
time single-particle Green's functions. We obtain nine non-equilibrium vertex
corrections and find they can be solved by a set of simple linear equations. As
a result, the averaged non-equilibrium density matrix and various important
transport properties, including averaged current, disordered induced current
fluctuation and the averaged shot noise, can all be efficiently computed in a
unified simple scheme. Moreover, the relationship between the non-equilibrium
vertex correction method and the non-equilibrium coherent potential
approximation theory is clarified, and we prove the non-equilibrium coherent
potential equals the non-equilibrium vertex correction and this equivalence is
guaranteed by the Keldysh's formulas. In addition, a generalized form of
conditionally averaged non-equilibrium Green's function is derived to
incorporate with density functional theory to enable first-principles quantum
transport simulation. Our approach provides a unified, efficient and
self-consistent method for simulating non-equilibrium quantum transport through
disordered nanoelectronics.

their formation, they cool through a spectral type transition from L to T,
which encompasses the dissipation of cloud opacity and the appearance of strong
methane absorption. While there are hundreds of known T-type brown dwarfs, the
first generation of directly-imaged exoplanets were all L-type. Recently,
Kuzuhara et al. (2013) announced the discovery of GJ 504 b, the first T dwarf
exoplanet. GJ 504 b provides a unique opportunity to study the atmosphere of a
new type of exoplanet with a ~500 K temperature that bridges the gap between
the first directly imaged planets (~1000 K) and our own Solar System's Jupiter
(~130 K). We observed GJ 504 b in three narrow L-band filters (3.71, 3.88, and
4.00 microns), spanning the red end of the broad methane fundamental absorption
feature (3.3 microns) as part of the LEECH exoplanet imaging survey. By
comparing our new photometry and literature photometry to a grid of custom
model atmospheres, we were able to fit GJ 504 b's unusual spectral energy
distribution for the first time. We find that GJ 504 b is well-fit by models
with the following parameters: T_eff=544+/-10 K, g<600 m/s^2,
[M/H]=0.60+/-0.12, cloud opacity parameter of f_sed=2-5, R=0.96+/-0.07 R_Jup,
and log(L)=-6.13+/-0.03 L_Sun, implying a hot start mass of 3-30 M_jup for a
conservative age range of 0.1-6.5 Gyr. Of particular interest, our model fits
suggest that GJ 504 b has a super-stellar metallicity. Since planet formation
can create objects with non-stellar metallicities, while binary star formation
cannot, this result suggests that GJ 504 b formed like a planet, not like a
binary companion.

discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Outside the primary eclipse, the
light curves of such systems are usually smooth and characterised by low-level
variations caused by tidal distortion and heating of the M star component.
Early data on SDSS J1021+1744 obtained in June 2012 was unusual in showing a
dip in flux of uncertain origin shortly after the white dwarf's eclipse. Here
we present high-time resolution, multi-wavelength observations of 35 more
eclipses over 1.3 years, showing that the dip has a lifetime extending over
many orbits. Moreover the ""dip"" is in fact a series of dips that vary in depth,
number and position, although they are always placed in the phase interval 1.06
to 1.26 after the white dwarf's eclipse, near the L5 point in this system.
Since SDSS J1021+1744 is a detached binary, it follows that the dips are caused
by the transit of the white dwarf by material around the Lagrangian L5 point. A
possible interpretation is that they are the signatures of prominences, a
phenomenon already known from H-alpha observations of rapidly rotating single
stars as well as binaries. What makes SDSS J1021+1744 peculiar is that the
material is dense enough to block continuum light. The dips appear to have
finally faded out around 2015 May after the first detection by Parsons et al.

incentive properties are later combined with simple pricing rules and used as
mechanisms. The resulting mechanisms are often natural and simple to
understand. But how good are these algorithms as mechanisms? Truthful reporting
of valuations is typically not a dominant strategy (certainly not with a
pay-your-bid, first-price rule, but it is likely not a good strategy even with
a critical value, or second-price style rule either). Our goal is to show that
a wide class of approximation algorithms yields this way mechanisms with low
Price of Anarchy.
  The seminal result of Lucier and Borodin [SODA 2010] shows that combining a
greedy algorithm that is an $\alpha$-approximation algorithm with a
pay-your-bid payment rule yields a mechanism whose Price of Anarchy is
$O(\alpha)$. In this paper we significantly extend the class of algorithms for
which such a result is available by showing that this close connection between
approximation ratio on the one hand and Price of Anarchy on the other also
holds for the design principle of relaxation and rounding provided that the
relaxation is smooth and the rounding is oblivious.
  We demonstrate the far-reaching consequences of our result by showing its
implications for sparse packing integer programs, such as multi-unit auctions
and generalized matching, for the maximum traveling salesman problem, for
combinatorial auctions, and for single source unsplittable flow problems. In
all these problems our approach leads to novel simple, near-optimal mechanisms
whose Price of Anarchy either matches or beats the performance guarantees of
known mechanisms.

to determine whether strong, resonant (or non-resonant) planet-planet

large variations in climate. We also determine whether or not resonant
interactions affect the rate of lithopanspermia between the planet pair---which
could facilitate the growth and maintenance of life on both planets. We find
that first-order resonances do not cause larger obliquity variations compared
with non-resonant cases. We also find that resonant interactions are not a
primary consideration in lithopanspermia. Lithopanspermia is enhanced
significantly as the planet orbits come closer together---reaching nearly the
same rate as ejected material falling back to the surface of the originating
planet (assuming that the ejected material makes it out to the location of our
initial conditions). Thus, in both cases our results indicate that
close-proximity planet pairs in multihabitable systems are conducive to life in

and local coalescence of the magnetic fluxes. The formation of a MBF can
involve more than one of these processes. Out of the 70 cases, flux emergence
is the main process of a MBF buildup of 52 BPs, mainly convergence is seen in
28, and 14 cases are associated with local coalescence. For MBFs formed by
bipolar emergence, the time difference between the flux emergence and the BP
appearance in the AIA 193 \AA\ passband varies from 0.1 to 3.2 hours with an
average of 1.3 hours. While magnetic cancellation is found in all 70 BPs, it
can occur in three different ways: (I) between a MBF and small weak magnetic
features (in 33 BPs); (II) within a MBF with the two polarities moving towards
each other from a large distance (34 BPs); (III) within a MBF whose two main
polarities emerge in the same place simultaneously (3 BPs). While a MBF builds
up the skeleton of a BP, we find that the magnetic activities responsible for

our calculation are found to be in nice agreement with the experimental values.
Therefore, by looking at the HFS results we can say that both $E_\mathrm{eff}$
and $W_\mathrm{s}$ values are also very accurate. Further, We have derived the
relationship between these quantities and the ratio which will help to get
model independent value of eEDM and S-PS interaction constant.

However, most of the existing self-testing protocols for two devices exploit
the well-known Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality or modifications of
it, and always with two measurements per party. Here, we generalize the
previous results by demonstrating that one can construct self-testing protocols
based on the chained Bell inequalities, defined for two devices implementing an
arbitrary number of two-output measurements. On the one hand, this proves that
the quantum state and measurements leading to the maximal violation of the
chained Bell inequality are unique. On the other hand, in the limit of a large
number of measurements, our approach allows one to self-test the entire plane
of measurements spanned by the Pauli matrices X and Z. Our results also imply
that the chained Bell inequalities can be used to certify two bits of perfect
randomness.

distance, $D_A$ given by the distance duality relation (DDR) is very
significant in observational cosmology. It is very closely tied with the
temperature- redshift relation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.
Any deviation from $\eta(z)\equiv \frac{D_L}{D_A (1+z)^2} =1$ indicates a
possible emergence of new physics. Our aim in this work is to check the
consistency of these relations using a non-parametric regression method namely,
LOESS with SIMEX. This technique avoids dependency on the cosmological model
and works with a minimal set of assumptions. Further, to analyze the efficiency
of the methodology, we simulate a dataset of $200$ points of $\eta (z)$ data
based on a phenomenological model $\eta(z)= (1+z)^\epsilon$. The error on the
simulated data points is obtained by using the temperature of CMB radiation at
various redshifts. For testing the distance duality relation, we use the JLA
SNe Ia data for luminosity distances, while the angular diameter distances are
obtained from radio galaxies datasets. Since the DDR is linked with CMB
temperature - redshift relation, therefore we also use the CMB temperature data
to reconstruct $\eta (z)$. It is important to note that with CMB data, we are
able to study the evolution of DDR up to a very high redshift $ z = 2.418$. In
this analysis, we find no evidence of deviation from $\eta=1$ within a

Collisional Radiative Models [1] that simplify the chemical kinetics by
quasi-steady state assignment on certain types of particles. The assignment is
conventionally based on the classification of the plasma species by the ratio
of the transport to the local destruction frequencies. We show that the
classification is not exact due to the role of the time-dependent local
production, and a measure is necessary to confirm the validity of the
assignment. The main goal of this study is to evaluate a measure on the
quasi-steady state assumptions of these models. Inspired by a chemical
reduction technique called Intrinsic Low Dimensional Manifolds [2, 3], an
estimate local source is provided at the transport time-scale. This source is a
deviation from the quasi-steady state for the particle and its value is
assigned as an error of the quasi-steady state assumption. The propagation of
this error on the derived quantities is formulated in the Collisional Radiative
Models. Based on the error a novel technique is proposed to discriminate the
quasi-steady states. The developed analysis is applied to mercury and argon
fluorescent lamps separately and the corresponding errors are presented. We
observe that the novel and conventional technique agrees for most of the
excited levels but disagrees for a few low energy excited states.

Circumventing the introduction of any kind of effective parameters we directly
use the S-parameters of the individual metasurfaces to calculate the response
of an arbitrary stack. In fact, the S-parameters are the complex parameters of
choice fully characterizing the homogeneous metasurfaces, in particular with
respect to its polarization manipulating properties. Just as effective material
parameters like the permittivity and the permeability or wave parameters like
the propagation constant and the impedance, the stacking based upon S-matrices
can be applied as long as the individual layers are decoupled with respect to
their near-fields. This requirement eventually sets the limits for using the
optical properties of the individual layers to calculate the response of the
stacked system - this being the conceptual aim for any homogeneous metasurface
or metamaterial layer and therefore the essence of what is eventually possible
with homogeneous metasurfaces. As simple and appealing this approach is, as
powerful it is as well: Combining structured metasurface with each other as
well as with isotropic, anisotropic or chiral homogeneous layers is possible by
simple semi-analytical S-matrix multiplication. Hence, complex stacks and
resonators can be set up, accurately treated and optimized with respect to
their dispersive polarization sensitive optical functionality without the need
for further rigorous full-wave simulations.

the ground based interferometric detectors. However, several mechanisms have
been proposed for the formation of binary systems, which retain eccentricity
throughout their lifetimes. Since no matched-filtering algorithm has been
developed to extract continuous GW signals from compact binaries on orbits with
low to moderate values of eccentricity, and available algorithms to detect

this paper we propose a search method for detection of gravitational waves

the search sensitivity and the false alarm rates on a segment of data from the

viscous drops attached to a flat inclined substrate using thin gravity-driven
film flows. A convective mass transfer establishes across the drop-film
interface and the tracer in the drop diffuses into the film flow. The Peclet
number for the tracer in the film is large. The Peclet number Pe_d in the drop
varies from 0.01 to 1. The characteristic transport time in the drop is much
larger than in the film. We model the mass transfer of the tracer from the drop
bulk into the film using an empirical model based on Newton's law of cooling.
This model is supported by a theoretical model solving the quasi-steady 2D
advection-diffusion equation in the film coupled with a time-dependent 1D
diffusion equation in the drop. We find excellent agreement between our
experimental data and the 2 models, which predict an exponential decrease in
time of the tracer concentration in the drop. The results are valid for all
drop and film Peclet numbers studied. The transport characteristic time is
related to the drop diffusion time scale, as diffusion within the drop is the
limiting process. Our theoretical model predicts the well-known relationship
between the Sherwood and Reynolds numbers in the case of a well-mixed drop
Sh~Re_L^{1/3}=\gamma L^2/\nu_f, based on the drop length L, film shear rate
\gamma and film kinematic viscosity \nu_f. We show that this relationship is
mathematically equivalent to a more physically intuitive relationship
Sh~Re_\delta, based on the diffusive boundary layer thickness \delta. The model
also predicts a correction in the case of a non-uniform drop concentration,
which depends on Re_\delta, the Schmidt number, the drop aspect ratio and the
diffusivity ratio. This prediction is in agreement with experiments at low
Pe_d. It also agrees as Pe_d approaches 1, although the influence of Re_\delta
increases.

sequences of tasks, some of them provided by the user, others invented by the
RNNAI itself in a curious, playful fashion, to improve its RNN-based world
model. Unlike our previous model-building RNN-based RL machines dating back to
1990, the RNNAI learns to actively query its model for abstract reasoning and
planning and decision making, essentially ""learning to think."" The basic ideas
of this report can be applied to many other cases where one RNN-like system
exploits the algorithmic information content of another. They are taken from a

different patterns of three bands with either small particles at the equator

supporting qualitative experiments to explore the effect of the tumbler wall
roughness on the segregation pattern, modeling the tumbler walls as either a
closely packed monolayer of fixed particles resulting in a rough wall, or as a
geometrically smooth wall. Even though the tumbler wall is in contact with the
flowing layer only at its periphery, the impact of wall roughness is profound.
Smooth walls tend toward a small-large-small (SLS) band pattern at the
pole-equator-pole at all but the highest fill fractions; rough walls tend
toward a large-small-large (LSL) band pattern at all but the lowest fill
fractions. This comes about because smooth walls induce poleward axial drift of
small particles and an equator-directed drift for large particles, resulting in
an SLS band pattern. On the other hand, rough walls result in both sizes of
particles moving poleward at the surface of the flow, but due to radial
segregation, small particles percolate lower in the flowing layer where there
is a return drift toward the equator while large particles remain at the
surface near the pole, resulting in an LSL band pattern. The tendency toward
either of the two band patterns depends on the fill level in the tumbler and
the roughness of the tumbler's bounding wall.

  We consider a related problem, which we call the ""Alternating Stock Size
Problem"", where the number of positive and negative integers in the input set S
are equal. The problem is the same as above, but we are additionally required
to alternate the positive and negative numbers in the output ordering. This
problem also has several simple 2-approximations. We show that it can be
approximated to within 1.79.
  Then we show that this problem is closely related to an optimization version
of the gasoline puzzle due to Lov\'asz, in which we want to minimize the size
of the gas tank necessary to go around the track. We present a 2-approximation
for this problem, using a natural linear programming relaxation whose feasible
solutions are doubly stochastic matrices. Our novel rounding algorithm is based
on a transformation that yields another doubly stochastic matrix with special
properties, from which we can extract a suitable permutation.

renormalization of effective masses due to the substrate-related polaronic

distance, $z$. Among the substrate considered, the largest gap broadening at $
z=2.5$ \AA{} is observed for the Al$_{2} $O$_{3} $ substrate, which is found to
be $ \sim 50$ meV. Carrier-phonon coupling also renormalizes the effective
masses which is more pronounced along the zigzag direction. Anisotropy of the
effective masses becomes stronger by the influence of the polaronic effect
corresponding to direction-dependent carrier-phonon coupling. We conclude that
substrate phonons have a non-negligible effect on the static band properties of

theoretical predication concerning the electron-electron (\emph{e}-\emph{e})

disordered metal has not been fully tested thus far, though it was proposed 40
years ago [A. Schmid, Z. Phys. \textbf{271}, 251 (1974)]. We report here the
simultaneous observation of small- and large-energy-transfer \emph{e}-\emph{e}
scattering in 3D indium oxide thick films. In temperature region of
$T\gtrsim100$\,K, the temperature dependence of resistivities curves of the
films obey Bloch-Gr\""{u}neisen law, indicating the films possess degenerate
semiconductor characteristics in electrical transport property. In the low
temperature regime, $1/\tau_\varphi$ as a function of $T$ for each film can not
be ascribed to \emph{e}-ph scattering. To quantitatively describe the
temperature behavior of $1/\tau_\varphi$, both the 3D small- and
large-energy-transfer \emph{e}-\emph{e} scattering processes should be
considered (The small- and large-energy-transfer \emph{e}-\emph{e} scattering
rates are proportional to $T^{3/2}$ and $T^2$, respectively). In addition, the
experimental prefactors of $T^{3/2}$ and $T^{2}$ are proportional to
$k_F^{-5/2}\ell^{-3/2}$ and $E_F^{-1}$ ($k_F$ is the Fermi wave number, $\ell$
is the electron elastic mean free path, and $E_F$ is the Fermi energy),
respectively, which are completely consistent with the theoretical
predications. Our experimental results fully demonstrate the validity of
theoretical predications concerning both small- and large-energy-transfer
\emph{e}-\emph{e} scattering rates.

be associated by duality and separation argument to a backward SDE, which leads
to the so-called randomized dynamic programming principle and randomized
equation in terms of the path-dependent filter, and then characterizes the

subject of the present work is to compare measurements of modal noise and

influence of a simple mechanical scrambling method (excenter) on both FRD and
modal noise. Measurements are performed with circular and octagonal fibres from
Polymicro Technology (FBP-Series) with diameters of 100, 200 and 300 {\mu}m and
for square and rectangular fibres from CeramOptec, among others. FRD
measurements for the same sample of fibres are performed as a function of

STELLA-echelle-spectrograph (SES) in Tenerife with an octagonal and found a SNR
increase by a factor of 1.6 at 678 nm. It is shown in the laboratory that an
excenter with a large amplitude and low frequency will not influence the FRD
but will reduce modal noise rather effectively by up to 180%.

elusiveness of low-energy supersymmetry (SUSY). Some characteristic signals at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), such as mono-jet + \slashed{E}_T, had been
propounded as its trademark signals. However, later investigations suggested
that lower limits on the supersymmetric particle masses would be quite
stringent in spite of compression. Also, most compressed SUSY scenarios studied
so far are only partially compressed. In this backdrop, we make an exhaustive
analysis of the compressed SUSY scenarios for the 13 TeV run of LHC, keeping
the level of compression in the entire spectrum as high as possible. A broad
class of benchmark spectra are thus considered, after ensuring consistency with
the observed Higgs mass as well as the dark matter constraints. The rates of
observable events in the high-energy run are obtained through detailed
simulation, for both the multi-jet +\slashed{E}_T and mono-jet + \slashed{E}_T
final states. Our conclusion is that the former is still more efficient to
reveal a compressed SUSY spectrum first, while the latter can serve as a useful
confirmatory channel.

Kepler-10 and fourteen of its stellar twins. Stellar parameters and elemental

lessen the effect of throughput limitation due to access links, we also
investigate the usage of multiple interfaces at the hosts. We demonstrate,

69 potentially threatening NEOs from these lists that produce 261 dynamically
distinct impact instances, or Virtual Impactors (VIs), were calculated using
the Asteroid Risk Mitigation and Optimization Research (ARMOR) tool in
conjunction with OrbFit. ARMOR projected the impact probability of each VI onto
the surface of the Earth as a spatial probability distribution. The projection
considers orbit solution accuracy and the global impact probability. The method
of ARMOR is introduced and the tool is validated against two asteroid-Earth
collision cases with objects 2008 TC3 and 2014 AA. In the analysis, the natural
distribution of impact corridors is contrasted against the impact probability
distribution to evaluate the distributions conformity with the uniform impact
distribution assumption. The distribution of impact corridors is based on the
NEO population and orbital mechanics. The analysis shows that the distribution
of impact corridors matches the common assumption of uniform impact
distribution and the result extends the evidence base for the uniform
assumption from qualitative analysis of historic impact events into the future
in a quantitative way. This finding is confirmed in a parallel analysis of
impact points belonging to a synthetic population of 10006 VIs. Taking into
account the impact probabilities introduced significant variation into the
results and the impact probability distribution, consequently, deviates
markedly from uniformity. The concept of impact probabilities is a product of
the asteroid observation and orbit determination technique and, thus,
represents a man-made component that is largely disconnected from natural

species of teleost and elasmobranch fishes by employing varied experimental
methods including conditioning experiments, observations of alignment with
external fields, and experiments with magnetic deterrents. Biogenic magnetite
has been confirmed to be an important receptor mechanism in some species, but
there is ongoing debate regarding whether other mechanisms are at work. This
paper presents evidence for magnetoreception in three additional species, red
drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), and sea catfish
(Ariopsis felis), by employing experiments to test whether fish respond
differently to bait on a magnetic hook than on a control. In red drum, the
control hook outcaught the magnetic hook by 32 - 18 for chi-squared = 3.92 and
a P-value of 0.048. Black drum showed a significant attraction for the magnetic
hook, which prevailed over the control hook by 11 - 3 for chi-squared = 4.57
and a P-value of 0.033. Gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus) showed no
preference with a 31 - 35 split between magnetic hook and control for
chi-squared = 0.242 and a P-value of 0.623. In a sample of 100 sea catfish in
an analogous experiment using smaller hooks, the control hook was preferred
62-38 for chi-squared = 5.76 and a P-value of < 0.001. Such a simple method for
identifying magnetoreceptive species may quickly expand the number of known
magnetoreceptive species and allow for easier access to magnetoreceptive
species and thus facilitate testing of magnetoreceptive hypotheses.

Anderson and Blount showed that certain martensitic transitions involve
inversion symmetry breaking and the formal existence of a polar axis, so
'metallic ferroelectric' behavior has been claimed for metals undergoing a
centrosymmetric (CS) to non-CS structural transformation (Cd2ReO7, LiOsO3) or
natively non-CS (SrCaRu2O), or for ferroelectric insulators whose polar
distortion survives moderate metallicity induced by doping or proximity.
However, none of these systems, nor any other to our knowledge, embodies a
truly ferroelectric metal with native switchable polarization and native
metallicity coexisting in a single phase. Here we report the first-ever
theoretical prediction of such a material. By first-principles calculations, we
show that the layered perovskite Bi5Ti5O17 has a non-zero density of states at
the Fermi level and metal-like conductivity, as well as a spontaneous
polarization in zero field. Further, we predict that the polarization of
Bi5Ti5O17 is switchable both in principle, as the material complies with the
sufficient symmetry requirements, and in practice, as Bi5Ti5O17 can sustain a
sizable potential drop along the polar direction, as needed to revert its
polarization by application of an electric bias.

assumption, which results in a significant reduction of the number of diagrams
contributing to the small separation distance correction. An asymptotic
analysis of our small separation distance correction term finds that the
correction dominates at large $\sim 100$ GeV parent parton energies; scales
like $L$ with the size of the system for small $L$, but like $L^0$ at larger
$L$; and breaks color triviality. An extensive numerical investigation of the
correction term confirms the aforementioned analytic findings, reveals that the
correction term does not go to zero for large $L$, finds that the correction is
sensitive to the mass of the parent parton, and shows a crucial dependence of
the energy loss on a proper treatment of the physics of separation distances on
the order of the Debye screening length. However, an examination of the large
formation time approximation shows that it is violated for much of the phase

observables, in particular with the W boson mass and $T$ parameter. Here we
explore a scenario with the light singlet (and bino-singlino) state in which
the second-lightest scalar takes the role of the SM-like boson with mass close
to 125 GeV. In such a case the second-lightest Higgs state gets pushed up via
mixing already at tree-level and thereby reducing the required loop correction.
Unlike in the NMSSM, the light singlet is necessarily connected with a light
neutralino which naturally appears as a promising dark matter candidate. We
show that dark matter and LHC searches place further bounds on this scenario
and point out parameter regions, which are viable and of interest for LHC Run

temperature-pressure profile measured via sodium D absorption in HD 189733 b,
but show unexplained differences in the case of HD 209458 b. In contrast to
general assumptions, we find that the gravitationally more tightly bound
thermospheres of massive and compact planets, such as HAT-P-2 b are
hydrodynamically stable. Compact planets dispose of the radiative energy input
through hydrogen Ly$\alpha$ and free-free emission. Radiative cooling is also
important in HD 189733 b, but it decreases toward smaller planets like GJ 436
b. The simulations show that the strong and cool winds of smaller planets
mainly cause strong Ly$\alpha$ absorption but little emission. Compact and
massive planets with hot, stable thermospheres cause small absorption signals
but are strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters, possibly detectable with the current
instrumentation. The absorption and emission signals provide a possible
distinction between these two classes of thermospheres in hot gas planets.
According to our results, WASP-80 and GJ 3470 are currently the most promising
targets for observational follow-up aimed at detecting atmospheric Ly$\alpha$

that interrelates the defect parameters with the bulk elastic and expansivity
data: for various defect processes in a given matrix material, a
proportionality exists between defect entropies and enthalpies. The
investigation is focused on BaF2 for which ab-initio calculations within
density functional theory and the generalized-gradient approximation have been
recently made as far as the formation and migration of intrinsic defects is
concerned, as well as for the elastic constants. Four defect processes have
been studied in BaF$_2$: Anion Frenkel formation, fluorine vacancy migration,
fluorine interstitial motion and electrical relaxation associated with a single
tetravalent uranium. For these processes, the entropies and enthalpies vary by
almost two orders of magnitude and reveal a proportionality between them. We
find that this proportionality is solely governed by the bulk elasticity and
expansivity data, which conforms to the aforementioned thermodynamical model.

closed form the reduced density matrix of a block of $L$ spins when the whole
system is in its ground state, and study the corresponding von Neumann and
R\'enyi entanglement entropies in the thermodynamic limit. We show that both of
these entropies scale as $a\log L$ when $L$ tends to infinity, where the
coefficient $a$ is equal to $(m-k)/2$ in the ground state phase with $k$
vanishing su$(m+1)$ magnon densities. In particular, our results show that none
of these generalized Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models are critical, since when
$L\to\infty$ their R\'enyi entropy $R_q$ becomes independent of the parameter
$q$. We have also computed the Tsallis entanglement entropy of the ground state

be made extensive by an appropriate choice of its parameter only when
$m-k\ge3$. Finally, in the su$(3)$ case we construct in detail the phase

in a simple way by the weights of the fundamental representation of su$(3)$.

impact on the spread of invasive species. Modelling using integrodifference
equations suggests that, when long distance contacts are represented by a
fat-tailed dispersal kernel, an accelerating wave of advance can ensue.
Invasions spreading in this manner could have particularly dramatic effects.
Recently, various authors have suggested that demographic stochasticity
disrupts wave acceleration. Integrodifference models have been widely used in
movement ecology, and as such a clearer understanding of stochastic effects is
needed. Here, we present a stochastic non-linear one-dimensional lattice model
in which demographic stochasticity and the dispersal regime can be
systematically varied. Extensive simulations show that stochasticity has a
profound effect on model behaviour, and usually breaks acceleration for
fat-tailed kernels. Exceptions are seen for some power law kernels, $K(l)
\propto |l|^{-\beta}$ with $\beta < 3$, for which acceleration persists despite
stochasticity. Such kernels lack a second moment and are important in
`accelerating' phenomena such as L\'{e}vy flights. Furthermore, for long-range
kernels the approach to the continuum limit behaviour as stochasticity is
reduced is generally slow. Given that real-world populations are finite,
stochastic models may give better predictive power when long-range dispersal is
important. Insights from mean-field models such as integrodifference equations
should be applied with caution in such circumstances.

energy-limited escape concept is valid only for planets with a gravitational
potential lower than $\log_\mathrm{10}\left( -\Phi_{\mathrm{G}}\right) <
13.11~$erg$\,$g$^{-1}$ because in these planets the radiative energy input is
efficiently used to drive the planetary wind. Massive and compact planets with
$\log_\mathrm{10}\left( -\Phi_{\mathrm{G}}\right) \gtrsim 13.6~$erg$\,$g$^{-1}$
exhibit more tightly bound atmospheres in which the complete radiative energy
input is re-emitted through hydrogen Ly$\alpha$ and free-free emission. These
planets therefore host hydrodynamically stable thermospheres. Between these two
extremes the strength of the planetary winds rapidly declines as a result of a
decreasing heating efficiency. Small planets undergo enhanced evaporation
because they host expanded atmospheres that expose a larger surface to the
stellar irradiation. We present scaling laws for the heating efficiency and the
expansion radius that depend on the gravitational potential and irradiation
level of the planet. The resulting revised energy-limited escape concept can be
used to derive estimates for the mass-loss rates of super-Earth-sized planets

for investigating the role of intermediate variables that lie in the path
between a randomized treatment and an outcome variable. The influence of the
intermediate variable on the outcome is often explored using structural
equation models (SEMs), with model coefficients interpreted as possible
effects. While there has been significant research on the topic in recent
years, little work has been done on mediation analysis when the intermediate
variable (mediator) is a high-dimensional vector. In this work we present a new
method for exploratory mediation analysis in this setting called the directions
of mediation (DMs). The first DM is defined as the linear combination of the
elements of a high-dimensional vector of potential mediators that maximizes the
likelihood of the SEM. The subsequent DMs are defined as linear combinations of
the elements of the high-dimensional vector that are orthonormal to the
previous DMs and maximize the likelihood of the SEM. We provide an estimation
algorithm and establish the asymptotic properties of the obtained estimators.
This method is well suited for cases when many potential mediators are
measured. Examples of high-dimensional potential mediators are brain images
composed of hundreds of thousands of voxels, genetic variation measured at
millions of SNPs, or vectors of thousands of variables in large-scale
epidemiological studies. We demonstrate the method using a functional magnetic

determining which brain locations mediate the relationship between the

Nevertheless, optimizing the power delivery from spacecraft to Earth is needed.
In RF communications, the strategy has been to increase the aperture of ground
terminals. Free-space optical communications can also follow it, as they share
the limitation of low power received on Earth. As the cost of big telescopes
increases exponentially with aperture, new ideas are required to maximize the
aperture-to-cost ratio. This work explores the feasibility of using telescopes
of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array as optical-communication ground
stations. Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy has the same power limitation, hence
Cherenkov telescopes are designed to maximize receiver's aperture with minimum
cost and some relaxed requirements. Both critical issues of the reutilization
and possible adaptations of the telescopes to optimize them for communications,
and telescopes simulations and numerical computations of several link budgets
applied to worst-case scenarios are discussed, concluding that the proposal is
technically feasible and would bring important cost reductions and performance
improvements compared to current designs for deepspace optical ground stations.

without impacting the comfort of the end user. This feature makes them a prime
candidate for residential demand response. However, the stochastic and
nonlinear dynamics of electric water heaters, makes it challenging to harness
their flexibility. Driven by this challenge, this paper formulates the
underlying sequential decision-making problem as a Markov decision process and
uses techniques from reinforcement learning. Specifically, we apply an
auto-encoder network to find a compact feature representation of the sensor
measurements, which helps to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. A wellknown
batch reinforcement learning technique, fitted Q-iteration, is used to find a
control policy, given this feature representation. In a simulation-based
experiment using an electric water heater with 50 temperature sensors, the
proposed method was able to achieve good policies much faster than when using
the full state information. In a lab experiment, we apply fitted Q-iteration to
an electric water heater with eight temperature sensors. Further reducing the
state vector did not improve the results of fitted Q-iteration. The results of
the lab experiment, spanning 40 days, indicate that compared to a thermostat
controller, the presented approach was able to reduce the total cost of energy
consumption of the electric water heater by 15%.

complementary methods to quantify, independent of protein size, the degree of
ligand burial in a protein receptor. In this report, we present results that

that results of the implementation of the TS and CP methods on six protein

CPM_Pos_Side.f and CPM_Zero_Side.f. The first program calculates the x-, y- and
z-coordinates of the molecular geometric centroid of the protein (global
centroid, GC), the center of the TS. Its radius is the distance between the GC
and the local centroid (LC), the centroid of the bound ligand or a portion of
its binding site. The second program finds the number of protein atoms inside,
outside and on the TS. The third determines the four coefficients A, B, C and D

black hole solutions in gravity's rainbow in context of Einstein gravity
coupled with various models of nonlinear electrodynamics. We regard an energy
dependent spacetime and obtain related metric functions and electric fields. We
show that there is an essential singularity at the origin which is covered with
an event horizon. We also compute the conserved and thermodynamical quantities
and examine the validity of the first law of thermodynamics in the presence of
rainbow functions. Finally, we investigate thermal stability conditions for
these black hole solutions in context of canonical ensemble. We show that
thermodynamical structure of the solutions depends on the choices of
nonlinearity parameters, charge and energy functions.

appropriate point transformation of variables. For the resulting equation, we
study the group-theoretic properties, namely, we find the maximal algebra of

number of exact group-invariant solutions of the equation. Using the results
obtained, we get a number of exact solutions of the Black--Scholes equation
under study and apply the ones to resolving several boundary value problems
with appropriate from the economic point of view terminal and boundary
conditions.

  Model",,,,,"physics.ao-ph math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finite elements has been proven to be an useful tool to discretize the
vertical coordinate in the hydrostatic forecast models allowing to define model
variables in full levels so that no staggering is needed. In the
non-hydrostatic case a constraint in the vertical operators appears (called C1)
that does not allow to reduce the set of semi-implicit linear equations to a
single equation in one variable as in the analytic case. Recently vertical
finite elements based in B-splines have been used with an iterative method to
relax the C1 constraint. In this paper we want to develop properly some
representations of vertical operators in terms of B-splines in order to keep
the C1-constraint. An invertibility relation between integral and derivative
operators between vertical velocity and vertical divergence is also presented.
The final scope of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework of
development of finite element vertical operators to be implemented in the
ALADIN-HIRLAM nwp system

which is one special case of Integral Value Transformations (IVTs). Earlier in
[5] it has been proved that sum of two non-negative integers is equal to the
sum of their CVT and XOR values in any base system. In the present study, this
phenomenon is extended to perform CVT and XOR operations for many non-negative
integers in any base system. To achieve that both the definition of CVT and XOR
are modified over the set of multiple integers instead of two. Also some
important properties of these operations have been studied. With the help of
cellular automata the adder circuit designed in [14] on using CVT-XOR
recurrence formula is used to design a parallel adder circuit for multiple
numbers in binary number system.
