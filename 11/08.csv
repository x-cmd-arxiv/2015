boson mass in supersymmetry (SUSY). The LHC searches for stop have made a great
progress and tightly constrained the stop mass during Run-1. In this work, we
use the LHC Run-1 data to determine the lower mass limit of the right-handed
stop in a natural SUSY scenario, where the higgsinos $\tilde{\chi}^0_{1,2}$ and
$\tilde{\chi}^\pm_{1}$ are light and nearly degenerate. We find that the stop
mass has been excluded up to 430 GeV for $m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_1} \lesssim 250$
GeV and to 540 GeV for $m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_1} \simeq 100$ GeV by the Run-1 SUSY
searches for $2b+E^{miss}_T$ and $1\ell+jets+E^{miss}_T$, respectively. In a
small strip of parameter space with $m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_1} \gtrsim 190$ GeV, the
stop mass can still be as light as 210 GeV and compatible with the Higgs mass
measurement and the monojet bound. The 14 TeV LHC with a luminosity of 20
fb$^{-1}$ can further cover such a light stop window by monojet and
$2b+E^{miss}_T$ searches and push the lower bound of the stop mass to 710 GeV.
We also explore the potential to use the Higgs golden ratio,
$D_{\gamma\gamma}=\sigma(pp \to h \to \gamma\gamma)/\sigma(pp \to h \to ZZ^*
\to4\ell^\pm)$, as a complementary probe for the light and compressed stop. If
this golden ratio can be measured at percent level at the high luminosity LHC

of the currently allowed parameter region.

end-users to outsource their computational tasks to the cloud and utilize the
shared cloud resources in a pay-per-use manner. However, once the tasks are
outsourced, the end-users will lose control of their data, which may result in
severe security issues especially when the data is sensitive. To address this
problem, secure outsourcing mechanisms have been proposed to ensure security of
the end-users' outsourced data. In this paper, we investigate outsourcing of
general computational problems which constitute the mathematical basics for
problems emerged from various fields such as engineering and finance. To be
specific, we propose affine mapping based schemes for the problem
transformation and outsourcing so that the cloud is unable to learn any key
information from the transformed problem. Meanwhile, the overhead for the
transformation is limited to an acceptable level compared to the computational
savings introduced by the outsourcing itself. Furthermore, we develop
cost-aware schemes to balance the trade-offs between end-users' various
security demands and computational overhead. We also propose a verification
scheme to ensure that the end-users will always receive a valid solution from
the cloud. Our extensive complexity and security analysis show that our
proposed Cost-Aware Secure Outsourcing (CASO) scheme is both practical and
effective.

systems, which can maintain optimal bandwidth and storage space. Two types of
important regenerating code have been constructed: the minimum storage
regeneration (MSR) code and the minimum bandwidth regeneration (MBR) code.
However, in hostile networks where adversaries can compromise storage nodes,
the storage capacity of the network can be significantly affected. In this
paper, we propose two optimal constructions of regenerating codes through
rate-matching that can combat against this kind of adversaries in hostile
networks: 2-layer rate-matched regenerating code and $m$-layer rate-matched
regenerating code. For the 2-layer code, we can achieve the optimal storage
efficiency for given system requirements. Our comprehensive analysis shows that
our code can detect and correct malicious nodes with higher storage efficiency
compared to the universally resilient regenerating code which is a
straightforward extension of regenerating code with error detection and
correction capability. Then we propose the $m$-layer code by extending the
2-layer code and achieve the optimal error correction efficiency by matching
the code rate of each layer's regenerating code. We also demonstrate that the
optimized parameter can achieve the maximum storage capacity under the same
constraint. Compared to the universally resilient regenerating code, our code
can achieve much higher error correction efficiency.

a pair of correlated discrete random variables $(X,Y)$ governed by a given

public user as much information about $Y$ as possible without compromising the
amount of information revealed about $X$. To this end, the so-called {\em
rate-privacy function} is introduced to quantify the maximal amount of
information (measured in terms of mutual information) that can be extracted
from $Y$ under a privacy constraint between $X$ and the extracted information,
where privacy is measured using either mutual information or maximal
correlation. Properties of the rate-privacy function are analyzed and
information-theoretic and estimation-theoretic interpretations of it are
presented for both the mutual information and maximal correlation privacy
measures. It is also shown that the rate-privacy function admits a closed-form
expression for a large family of joint distributions of $(X,Y)$. Finally, the
rate-privacy function under the mutual information privacy measure is
considered for the case where $(X,Y)$ has a joint probability density function
by studying the problem where the extracted information is a uniform
quantization of $Y$ corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. The asymptotic
behavior of the rate-privacy function is studied as the quantization resolution
grows without bound and it is observed that not all of the properties of the
rate-privacy function carry over from the discrete to the continuous case.

$H^k$ and $G$, where $H^k$ is the lexicographic product of the graph $H$ by
itself $k$ times. In this paper, we determine the spectrum of $H^k[G]$ and
$H^k$ when $G$ and $H$ are regular and the Laplacian spectrum of $H^k[G]$ and
$H^k$ for $G$ and $H$ arbitrary. Particular emphasis is given to the least
eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix in the case of lexicographic powers of
regular graphs, and to the algebraic connectivity and the largest Laplacian
eigenvalues in the case of lexicographic powers of arbitrary graphs. This
approach allows the determination of the spectrum (in case of regular graphs)
and Laplacian spectrum (for arbitrary graphs) of huge graphs. As an example,
the spectrum of the lexicographic power of the Petersen graph with the googol
number (that is, $10^{100}$) of vertices is determined. The paper finish with
the extension of some well known spectral and combinatorial invariant
properties of graphs to its lexicographic powers.

associated with rare transient responses due to the occurrence of internal
instabilities. Here we develop a computational method, a probabilistic
decomposition-synthesis technique, that takes into account the nature of
internal instabilities to inexpensively determine the non-Gaussian probability
density function for any arbitrary quantity of interest. Our approach relies on
the decomposition of the statistics into a `non-extreme core', typically
Gaussian, and a heavy-tailed component. This decomposition is in full
correspondence with a partition of the phase space into a `stable' region where
we have no internal instabilities, and a region where non-linear instabilities
lead to rare transitions with high probability. We quantify the statistics in
the stable region using a Gaussian approximation approach, while the
non-Gaussian distributions associated with the intermittently unstable regions
of the phase space are inexpensively computed through order-reduction methods
that take into account the strongly nonlinear character of the dynamics. The
probabilistic information in the two domains is analytically synthesized
through a total probability argument. The proposed approach allows for the
accurate quantification of non-Gaussian tails at more than 10 standard
deviations, at a fraction of the cost associated with the direct Monte-Carlo
simulations. We demonstrate the probabilistic decomposition-synthesis method
for rare events for two dynamical systems exhibiting extreme events: a
two-degree-of-freedom system of nonlinearly coupled oscillators, and in a
nonlinear envelope equation characterizing the propagation of unidirectional
water waves.

subfields including computational biology, asks for the longest repetitive
substring(s) covering a particular string position (point query). In this
paper, we extend the longest repeat query from point query to \emph{interval
query}, allowing the search for longest repeat(s) covering any position
interval, and thus significantly improve the usability of the solution. Our
method for interval query takes a different approach using the insight from a
recent work on \emph{shortest unique substrings} [1], as the prior work's
approach for point query becomes infeasible in the setting of interval query.
Using the critical insight from [1], we propose an indexing structure, which
can be constructed in the optimal $O(n)$ time and space for a string of size
$n$, such that any future interval query can be answered in $O(1)$ time.
Further, our solution can find \emph{all} longest repeats covering any given
interval using optimal $O(occ)$ time, where $occ$ is the number of longest
repeats covering that given interval, whereas the prior $O(n)$-time and space
work can find only one candidate for each point query. Experiments with
real-world biological data show that our proposal is competitive with prior
works, both time and space wise, while providing with the new functionality of
interval queries as opposed to point queries provided by prior works.

yet its operation remains largely-hidden from direct observation. As a result,
much of our understanding concerning stellar convection necessarily derives
from theoretical and computational models. The Sun is, however, exceptional in
that regard. The wealth of observational data afforded by its proximity
provides a unique testbed for comparing convection models against observations.
When such comparisons are carried out, surprising inconsistencies between those
models and observations become apparent. Both photospheric and helioseismic
measurements suggest that convection simulations may overestimate convective
flow speeds on large spatial scales. Moreover, many solar convection
simulations have difficulty reproducing the observed solar differential
rotation due to this apparent overestimation. We present a series of
3-dimensional (3-D) stellar convection simulations designed to examine how the
amplitude and spectral distribution of convective flows are established within
a star's interior. While these simulations are non-magnetic and non-rotating in
nature, they demonstrate two robust phenomena. When run with sufficiently high
Rayleigh number, the integrated kinetic energy of the convection becomes
effectively independent of thermal diffusion, but the spectral distribution of
that kinetic energy remains sensitive to both of these quantities. A simulation
that has converged to a diffusion-independent value of kinetic energy will
divide that energy between spatial scales such that low-wavenumber power is
overestimated, and high-wavenumber power is underestimated relative to a
comparable system possessing higher Rayleigh number. We discuss the
implications of these results in light of the current inconsistencies between
models and observations.

the class of single-minded buyers as well. Beyond the negative results on

One way to unambiguously show high mass stars can assemble their gas through
the former route would be to find a high mass star forming in isolation. Making
use of recently available CORNISH and ATLASGAL Galactic plane survey data, we
develop sample selection criteria to try and find such an object. From an
initial list of approximately 200 sources, we identify the high mass star
forming region G13.384+0.064 as the most promising candidate. The region
contains a strong radio continuum source, that is powered by an early B-type
star. The bolometric luminosity, derived from infrared measurements, is
consistent with this. However, sub-millimetre continuum emission, measured in
ATLASGAL, as well as dense gas tracers, such as HCO+(3-2) and N2H+(3-2)
indicate that there is less than 100 M$_{\odot}$ of material surrounding this

required to put a stronger constraint on the upper mass limit of young, lower

  Programming techniques",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quadratic programming (QP) is a well-studied fundamental NP-hard optimization
problem which optimizes a quadratic objective over a set of linear constraints.
In this paper, we reformulate QPs as a mixed-integer linear problem (MILP).
This is done via the reformulation of QP as a linear complementary problem, and
the use of binary variables and big-M constraints, to model the complementary
constraints. To obtain such reformulation, we show how to impose bounds on the
dual variables without eliminating all the (globally) optimal primal solutions;
using some fundamental results on the solution of perturbed linear systems.
  Reformulating non-convex QPs as MILPs provides an advantageous way to obtain
global solutions as it allows the use of current state-of-the-art MILP solvers.
To illustrate this, we compare the performance of our solution approach,
labeled quadprogIP, with the current benchmark global QP solver quadprogBB, as
well as with BARON, one of the leading non-linear programming (NLP) solvers,
and CPLEX's non-convex QP solver, on a large variety of QP test instances. In
practice, quadprogIP is shown to typically outperform by orders of magnitude
quadprogBB, BARON, and CPLEX on standard QPs. For general QPs, quadprogIP
outperforms quadprogBB, outperforms BARON in most instances, while CPLEX
performs the best on these instances. For box-constrained QPs, quadprogIP has a
comparable performance to quadprogBB and BARON in small- to medium-scale
instances, but is outperformed by these solvers on large-scale instances; while
CPLEX performs the best on box-constrained QP instances. Also, unlike
quadprogBB, the solution approach proposed here is able to solve QP instances
whose dual feasible set is unbounded. The MATLAB code, called quadprogIP, and
the instances used to perform these numerical experiments are publicly

paper presents a micro-founded mathematical model of the evolution of a social

evolution of the network is influenced by the extent to which individuals are
homophilic, structurally opportunistic, socially gregarious and by the
distribution of types in the society. In the analysis, we identify different
kinds of social capital: bonding capital, popularity capital, and bridging
capital. Bonding capital is created by forming a circle of connections,
homophily increases bonding capital because it makes this circle of connections
more homogeneous. Popularity capital leads to preferential attachment:
individuals who become popular tend to become more popular because others are
more likely to link to them. Homophily creates asymmetries in the levels of
popularity attained by different social groups, more gregarious types of agents
are more likely to become popular. However, in homophilic societies,
individuals who belong to less gregarious, less opportunistic, or major types
are likely to be more central in the network and thus acquire a bridging
capital.

potential to yield gains in efficiency and productivity by eliminating the need

  This paper describes a project with the Australian Turntable Company (ATC) to
develop software that generates near-optimal layouts for the paths taken by the

The geometry of the paths is constrained by the turning radius of the trucks
and by the boundary of the manoeuvring area. The software quantifies the
benefit of installing turntables by generating a design for paths with
turntables and comparing it with the layout in current or planned use by the

with the following characteristics: 1) the model can produce complex thought
sequences and can be generalized to new inputs, 2) it can receive and maintain
input information indefinitely for the generation of thoughts and later use,
and 3) it supports learning while executing. The crux of the model lies within
the concept of internal consistency, or the generated thoughts should always be
consistent with the inputs from which they are created. Its merit, apart from
the capability to generate new creative thoughts from an internal mechanism,
depends on the potential to help training to generalize better. This is
consequently enabled by separating input information into several parts to be
handled by different processing components with a focus mechanism to fetch
information for each. This modularized view with the focus binds the model with
the computationally capable Turing machines. And as a final remark, this paper
constructively shows that the computational complexity of the model is at
least, if not surpass, that of a universal Turing machine.

hole accretion with the presence of magnetic field. The field includes a
turbulent component, whose role is represented by the viscosity, and a
large-scale ordered component. The latter is further assumed to be evenly
symmetric with the equatorial plane. The equations are solved in the $r-\theta$
plane of a spherical coordinate by assuming time-steady and radially
self-similar. An inflow-wind solution is found. Around the equatorial plane,
the gas is inflowing; while above and below the equatorial plane at a certain
critical $\theta$ angle, $\theta\sim 47^{\circ}$, the inflow changes its
direction of radial motion and becomes wind. The driving forces are analyzed
and found to be the centrifugal force and the gradient of gas and magnetic
pressure. The properties of wind are also calculated. The specific angular
momentum of wind is found to be significantly larger than that of inflow, thus
wind can transfer angular momentum outward. These analytical results are
compared to those obtained by the trajectory analysis based on MHD numerical
simulation data and good agreements are found.

are recognized to be very powerful interstellar catalysts in star-forming
regions. The presence of dust can have a strong impact on the chemical
composition of molecular clouds. While observations show that many species that
formed onto dust grains populate the gas phase, the process that transforms
solid state into gas phase remains unclear. Aims. The aim of this paper is to
consider the chemical desorption process, i.e. the process that releases solid
species into the gas phase, in astrochemical models. These models allow
determining the chemical composition of star-forming environments with an
accurate treatment of the solid-phase chemistry. Methods. In paper I we derived
a formula based on experimental studies with which we quantified the
efficiencies of the chemical desorption process. Here we extend these results
to astrophysical conditions. Results. The simulations of astrophysical
environments show that the abundances of gas-phase methanol and H2O2 increase
by four orders of magnitude, whereas gas-phase H2CO and HO2 increase by one
order of magnitude when the chemical desorption process is taken into account.
The composition of the ices strongly varies when the chemical desorption is
considered or neglected. Conclusions. We show that the chemical desorption
process, which directly transforms solid species into gas-phase species, is
very efficient for many reactions. Applied to astrophysical environments such
as Rho Oph A, we show that the chemical desorption efficiencies derived in this
study reproduce the abundances of observed gas-phase methanol, HO2, and H2O2,
and that the presence of these molecules in the gas shows the last signs of the
evolution of a cloud before the frost.

In this work we present a theoretical viewpoint on a recent experimental
controversy regarding the spin excitations of Co adatoms on Pt(111). While one
group [Balashov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{102}, 257203 (2009)] claims to
have detected them, another group reported their observation only after the
hydrogenation of the Co adatom [Dubout et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{114},
106807 (2015)]. Utilizing time-dependent density functional theory in
combination with many-body perturbation theory we demonstrate that, although
inelastic spin excitations are possible for Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co adatoms, their
efficiency differs. While the excitation signature is less pronounced for Mn
and Co adatoms, it is larger for Cr and Fe adatoms. We find that the tunneling
matrix elements related to the nature and symmetry of the relevant electronic
states are more favorable for triggering the spin excitations in Fe than in Co.
An enhancement of the tunneling and of the inelastic spectra is possible by
attaching hydrogen to the adatom at the appropriate position.

edge-coloring $f$ with edges of $H$, such that for each vertex $x$ of $G$,
there is a vertex $y$ of $H$ with $f(\partial_G(x))=\partial_H(y)$. If $G$
admits an $H$-coloring, then we will write $H\prec G$. The Petersen coloring
conjecture of Jaeger states that for any bridgeless cubic graph $G$, one has:
$P\prec G$. The second author has recently introduced the Sylvester coloring
conjecture, which states that for any cubic graph $G$ one has: $S\prec G$. Here
$S$ is the Sylvester graph on $10$ vertices. In this paper, we prove the
analogue of Sylvester coloring conjecture for cubic pseudo-graphs. Moreover, we
show that if $G$ is any connected simple cubic graph $G$ with $G\prec P$, then
$G = P$. This implies that the Petersen graph does not admit an
$S_{16}$-coloring, where $S_{16}$ is the smallest connected simple cubic graph
without a perfect matching. $S_{16}$ has $16$ vertices. %We conjecture that
there are infinitely many connected cubic simple graphs which do not admit an
%$S_{16}$-coloring. Finally, we obtain $2$ results towards the Sylvester
coloring conjecture. The first result states that any cubic graph $G$ has a
coloring with edges of Sylvester graph $S$ such that at least $\frac45$ of
vertices of $G$ meet the conditions of Sylvester coloring conjecture. The
second result states that any claw-free cubic graph graph admits an
$S$-coloring. This results is an application of our result on cubic
pseudo-graphs.

inference problems: Some partial, or noisy, observations are performed over a
set of variables and the goal is to recover, or infer, the values of the
variables based on the indirect information contained in the measurements. For
such problems, the central scientific questions are: Under what conditions is
the information contained in the measurements sufficient for a satisfactory
inference to be possible? What are the most efficient algorithms for this task?
A growing body of work has shown that often we can understand and locate these
fundamental barriers by thinking of them as phase transitions in the sense of
statistical physics. Moreover, it turned out that we can use the gained
physical insight to develop new promising algorithms. Connection between
inference and statistical physics is currently witnessing an impressive
renaissance and we review here the current state-of-the-art, with a pedagogical
focus on the Ising model which formulated as an inference problem we call the
planted spin glass. In terms of applications we review two classes of problems:
(i) inference of clusters on graphs and networks, with community detection as a
special case and (ii) estimating a signal from its noisy linear measurements,
with compressed sensing as a case of sparse estimation. Our goal is to provide
a pedagogical review for researchers in physics and other fields interested in

an underlying optimization problem. They are a natural way to measure the
robustness of a system, or to identify its weakest spots. Interdiction problems
have been studied for a wide variety of classical combinatorial optimization
problems, including maximum $s$-$t$ flows, shortest $s$-$t$ paths, maximum
weight matchings, minimum spanning trees, maximum stable sets, and graph
connectivity. Most interdiction problems are NP-hard, and furthermore, even
designing efficient approximation algorithms that allow for estimating the
order of magnitude of a worst-case impact, has turned out to be very difficult.
Not very surprisingly, the few known approximation algorithms are heavily
tailored for specific problems.
  Inspired by an approach of Burch et al. (2003), we suggest a general method
to obtain pseudoapproximations for many interdiction problems. More precisely,
for any $\alpha>0$, our algorithm will return either a
$(1+\alpha)$-approximation, or a solution that may overrun the interdiction
budget by a factor of at most $1+\alpha^{-1}$ but is also at least as good as
the optimal solution that respects the budget. Furthermore, our approach can
handle submodular interdiction costs when the underlying problem is to find a
maximum weight independent set in a matroid, as for example the maximum weight
forest problem. The approach can sometimes be refined by exploiting additional
structural properties of the underlying optimization problem to obtain stronger
results. We demonstrate this by presenting a PTAS for interdicting $b$-stable
sets in bipartite graphs.

the study of both showers and the sporadic complex. The linkage of meteors to
meteor showers, to parent bodies, and to other meteors is done using measures
of orbital similarity. These measures often take the form of so-called
D-parameters and are generally paired with some cutoff value within which two
orbits are considered related. The appropriate cutoff value can depend on the
size of the data-set (Southworth & Hawkins 1963), the sporadic contribution
within the observed size range (Jopek 1995), or the inclination of the shower
(Galligan 2001). If the goal is to minimize sporadic contamination of the
extracted shower, the cutoff value should also reflect the strength of the
shower compared to the local sporadic background. In this paper, we present a
method for determining, on a per-shower basis, the orbital similarity cutoff
value that corresponds to a chosen acceptable false-positive rate. This method
also assists us in distinguishing which showers are significant within a set of
data. We apply these methods to optical meteor observations from the NASA
All-Sky and Southern Ontario Meteor Networks.

While the horizontal foot and the spine were connecting to the solar surface,
the vertical foot was suspended above the solar surface and supported by a
semicircular bubble structure. The bubble first collapsed and then reformed at
a similar height, finally, it started to oscillate for a long time. We find
that the collapsing and oscillation of the bubble boundary were tightly
associated with a flare-like feature located at the bottom of the bubble. Based
on the observational results, we propose that the prominence should be composed
of an overlying horizontal spine encircling a low-lying horizontal and a
vertical foot, in which the horizontal foot was consisted of shorter field
lines running partially along the spine and with the both ends connecting to
the solar surface, while the vertical foot was consisted of piling-up dips due
to the sagging of the spine fields and supported by a bipolar magnetic system
formed by parasitic polarities (i.e., the bubble). The upflows in the vertical
foot were possibly caused by the magnetic reconnection at the separator between
the bubble and the overlying dips, which intruded into the persistent downflow
field and formed the picture of counter-streaming mass flows. In addition, the
counter-streaming flows in the horizontal foot were possibly caused by the
imbalanced pressure at the both ends.

completely absent. The key in such a challenging setting is a semantic video
representation. Rather than building the representation from individual
attribute detectors and their annotations, we propose to learn the entire
representation from freely available web videos and their descriptions using an
embedding between video features and term vectors. In our proposed embedding,
which we call VideoStory, the correlations between the terms are utilized to
learn a more effective representation by optimizing a joint objective balancing
descriptiveness and predictability.We show how learning the VideoStory using a
multimodal predictability loss, including appearance, motion and audio
features, results in a better predictable representation. We also propose a
variant of VideoStory to recognize an event in video from just the important
terms in a text query by introducing a term sensitive descriptiveness loss. Our
experiments on three challenging collections of web videos from the NIST
TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection and Columbia Consumer Videos datasets
demonstrate: i) the advantages of VideoStory over representations using
attributes or alternative embeddings, ii) the benefit of fusing video
modalities by an embedding over common strategies, iii) the complementarity of
term sensitive descriptiveness and multimodal predictability for event
recognition without examples. By it abilities to improve predictability upon
any underlying video feature while at the same time maximizing semantic
descriptiveness, VideoStory leads to state-of-the-art accuracy for both few-

  Multiplication","10 pages",,,,"cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose an optimization selection methodology for the
ubiquitous sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) kernel. We propose two
models that attempt to identify the major performance bottleneck of the kernel
for every instance of the problem and then select an appropriate optimization
to tackle it. Our first model requires online profiling of the input matrix in
order to detect its most prevailing performance issue, while our second model
only uses comprehensive structural features of the sparse matrix. Our method
delivers high performance stability for SpMV across different platforms and
sparse matrices, due to its application and architecture awareness. Our
experimental results demonstrate that a) our approach is able to distinguish
and appropriately optimize special matrices in multicore platforms that fall
out of the standard class of memory bandwidth bound matrices, and b) lead to a
significant performance gain of 29% in a manycore platform compared to an
architecture-centric optimization, as a result of the successful selection of
the appropriate optimization for the great majority of the matrices. With a
runtime overhead equivalent to a couple dozen SpMV operations, our approach is
practical for use in iterative numerical solvers of real-life applications.

expanding light echoes from supernova (SN) 2014J in the nearby starburst galaxy
M82. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS/WFC images were taken ~277 and ~416 days
(after the time of B-band maximum light) in the filters F475W, F606W, and
F775W, each combined with the three polarizing filters: POL0V, POL60V, and
POL120V. The two epochs' imaging reveals the time evolution of at least two
major echoes. Three concentric bright regions between position angles (PA,
0^{\circ} from North, counterclockwise). 80^{\circ} ~ 170^{\circ} have
projected radius of 0.60"" on the sky on ~277 days and expanding to 0.75"" on
~416 days, corresponding to scattering materials at a foreground distance of
222\pm37 pc. Another fainter but evident light echo extending over a wide range
of PA has radii of 0.75"" and 0.96"" on ~277 and ~416 days. This corresponds to
scattering material at a foreground distance of 367\pm61 pc. Multiple light
echoes with S/N > 2.5 reside at smaller radii on ~277 days but become less
significant on ~416 days indicating a complex structure of foreground
interstellar medium (ISM). The light echo shows bluer color than predicted
under a Rayleigh scattering case. We also found the light echo brightened from
V_{echo}=21.68\pm0.07 on 2014 September 5, to V_{echo}=21.05\pm0.08 on 2014
November 6, suggesting an enhancement of echoing materials at different
distances projected on to the plane of the sky.

many derivations contain mistakes in the final expansion or rather (just) in

lunisolar expansion. We start with Kaula's expansion of the disturbing function
in terms of the equatorial elements of both the perturbed and perturbing

the inclination of the Moon becomes nearly constant, while the argument of

linearly with time.

compromise the correctness of the results. As an application, we analyze the
long--term motion of the highly elliptical and critically--inclined Molniya
orbits subject to quadrupolar gravitational interactions. The analytical
expansions presented herein are very powerful with respect to dynamical studies
based on Cartesian equations, because they quickly allow for a more holistic
and intuitively understandable picture of the dynamics.

classical electromagnetic theory.Two key features are required to understand
these classical origins.The first is that all waves diffract and weakly
diffracting waves,with a principal direction of propagation in the laboratory
frame, travel along that direction at speeds ever so slightly less than c.This
allows nontrivial Lorentz transformations that can act on selected forward F
waves or selected waves R traveling in the opposite direction to show that both
can arise from a single zero momentum frame where all the waves are transverse
to the original principal direction.Such F and R waves then both belong to a
single relativistic entity where correlations between the two are
unremarkable.The second feature requires the avoidance of using the Coulomb
gauge.Waves, tending to plane waves in the limit of zero diffraction,can then
be shown to be composed of two coupled sets of E and B fields that demonstrate
the classical entanglement of F and R waves.Being derived from Maxwells
equations,the theory is compatible with special relativity.This is used to
account for entanglement between waves traveling at arbitrary angles from a
source.In spite of a classical explanation,selection of appropriate F and R
waves means entanglement is likely to remain a quantum phenomenon.

on a special class of secular resonances, which depend only on the debris'
orbital inclination. This class is typically subdivided into three distinct
types of secular resonances: those occurring at the critical inclination, those
corresponding to polar orbits, and a third type resulting from a linear
combination of the rates of variation of the argument of perigee and the
longitude of the ascending node.
  The model describing the dynamics of space debris includes the effects of the
geopotential, as well as the Sun's and Moon's attractions, and it is defined in
terms of suitable action-angle variables. We consider the system averaged over
both the mean anomaly of the debris and those of the Sun and Moon. Such
multiply-averaged Hamiltonian is used to study the lunisolar resonances which
depend just on the inclination.
  Borrowing the technique from the theory of bifurcations of Hamiltonian normal
forms, we study the birth of periodic orbits and we determine the energy
thresholds at which the bifurcations of lunisolar secular resonances take
place. This approach gives us physically relevant information on the existence
and location of the equilibria, which help us to identify stable and unstable
regions in the phase space. Besides their physical interest, the study of
inclination dependent resonances offers interesting insights from the dynamical
point of view, since it sheds light on different phenomena related to
