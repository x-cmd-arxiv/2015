statistical learning task, in a high dimensional setting. We propose a scoring
and ranking strategy based on the PAC-Bayesian approach. We consider nonlinear
additive scoring functions, and we derive non-asymptotic risk bounds under a
sparsity assumption. In particular, oracle inequalities in probability holding
under a margin condition assess the performance of our procedure, and prove its
minimax optimality. An MCMC-flavored algorithm is proposed to implement our
method, along with its behavior on synthetic and real-life datasets.

Furthermore, the field dependence of $\kappa_0/T$ exhibits a clear ""$S$""-shape

fascinating behavior. For example, the magnetization of thin films of hard
magnetic materials is in general perpendicular to the thin-film plane, thanks
to the strong out-of-plane anisotropy, but its direction changes periodically,
forming an alternating spin-up and spin-down stripe pattern. The latter is
stabilized by the competition between the ferromagnetic coupling and
dipole-dipole interactions, and disappears when a moderate in-plane magnetic
field is applied. It has been suggested that such a behavior may be understood
in terms of a self-induced stripe glassiness. In this paper we show that such a
scenario is compatible with the experimental findings. The strong out-of-plane
magnetic anisotropy of the film is found to be beneficial for the formation of
both the stripe-ordered and glassy phases. At zero magnetic field the system
can form a glass only in a narrow interval of fairly large temperatures. An
in-plane magnetic field, however, shifts the glass transition towards lower
temperatures, therefore enabling it at or below room temperature. In good
qualitative agreement with the experimental findings, we show that a moderate
in-plane magnetic field of the order of $30~{\rm mT}$ can lead to the formation
of defects in the stripe pattern, which sets the onset of the glass transition.

scheme is developed based on coherent spin control. The wavepacket of the test

scale. A gravity induced dynamical phase (accrued solely on the spin state, and
measured through a Ramsey scheme) is used to reveal the above spatially
delocalised superposition of the spin-nano-object composite system that arises
during our scheme. We find a remarkable immunity to the motional noise in the
c.m. (initially in a thermal state with moderate cooling), and also a dynamical
decoupling nature of the scheme itself. Together they secure a high visibility
of the resulting Ramsey fringes. The mass independence of our scheme makes it
viable for a nano-object selected from an ensemble with a high mass
variability. Given these advantages, a quantum superposition with $100$ nm
spatial separation for a massive object of $10^9$ amu is achievable
experimentally, providing a route to test postulated modifications of quantum
theory such as continuous spontaneous localisation.

large scale applications of cuprate superconductors. While disordered
nanometric inclusions have shown to modify their vortex phase diagram and to
produce enhancements of the critical current1,2, the effect of ordered oxide
nanostructures remains essentially unexplored. This is due to the very small
nanostructure size imposed by the short coherence length, and to the
technological difficulties in the nanofabrication process. Yet, the novel
phenomena occurring at oxide interfaces open a wide spectrum of technological
opportunities to interplay with the superconductivity in cuprates. Here we show
that the unusual long range suppression of the superconductivity occurring at
the interface between manganites and cuprates affects vortex nucleation and
provides a novel vortex pinning mechanism. In particular, we show evidence of
commensurate pinning in YBCO films with ordered arrays of LCMO ferromagnetic
nanodots. Vortex pinning results from the proximity induced reduction of the
condensation energy at the vicinity of the magnetic nanodots, and yields an

be combined with current knowledge of the cosmological parameters yielding the

or reduced gene flow between populations. However, most population genetic
inference methods ignore population structure and reconstruct a history
characterized by population size changes under the assumption that species
behave as panmictic units. This is potentially problematic since population
structure can generate spurious signals of population size change. Moreover,
when the model assumed for demographic inference is misspecified, genomic data
will likely increase the precision of misleading if not meaningless parameters.
In a context of model uncertainty (panmixia \textit{versus} structure) genomic
data may thus not necessarily lead to improved statistical inference.
  We consider two haploid genomes and develop a theory which explains why any
demographic model (with or without population size changes) will necessarily be
interpreted as a series of changes in population size by inference methods
ignoring structure. We introduce a new parameter, the IICR (inverse
instantaneous coalescence rate), and show that it is equivalent to a population
size only in panmictic models, and mostly misleading for structured models. We
argue that this general issue affects all population genetics methods ignoring
population structure. We take the PSMC method as an example and show that it
infers population size changes that never took place. We apply our approach to
human genomic data and find a reduction in gene flow at the start of the
Pleistocene, a major increase throughout the Middle-Pleistocene, and an abrupt
disconnection preceding the emergence of modern humans.

the dynamics of quantum field theories. In many instances, correlators satisfy
the so-called \textit{cluster decomposition property} (CDP), which means that
they tend to zero for space-like asymptotic distances. However, under certain
conditions it is possible for correlators to violate this property. In the
context of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a violation of the CDP for correlators
of clusters involving coloured fields implies that the strength of the
correlations between the coloured degrees of freedom in these clusters
increases at large distances, which is a sufficient condition for confinement.
In this paper we establish a criterion for when the CDP is violated. By
applying this criterion to QCD, it turns out that certain lattice results
involving the quark and gluon propagators can be interpreted as evidence that
quarks and gluons are confined due to a violation of the CDP.

an algorithm that finds an optimal aggregated strategy and then decomposes it
into the single players' strategies. This approach yields strongly
polynomial-time algorithms to (i) find a pure Nash equilibrium, and (ii)
compute a socially optimal state, if the delay functions are weakly convex. We
also show how this technique can be extended to matroid congestion games.
  We introduce some combinatorial TU congestion games, where the players'
strategies are matchings, vertex covers, edge covers, and stable sets of a
given bipartite graph. In the asymmetric case, we show that for these games (i)
it is PLS-complete to find a pure Nash equilibrium even in case of linear delay
functions, and (ii) it is NP-hard to compute a socially optimal state, even in
case of weakly convex delay functions.

distance >100 kpc, was the first PN discovered in the outer streams of M31. The
[O III] 4363 auroral line was well detected in the spectra of all targets,
enabling electron temperature determination. Ionic abundances are derived based
on the [O III] temperatures, and elemental abundances of helium, nitrogen,
oxygen, neon, sulfur, and argon are estimated. The relatively low N/O and He/H
ratios as well as abundance ratios of alpha-elements indicate that our target
PNe might belong to populations as old as ~2 Gyr. Our PN sample, including the
current seven and the previous three observed by Fang et al., have rather
homogeneous oxygen abundances. The study of abundances and the spatial and
kinematical properties of our sample leads to the tempting conclusion that
their progenitors might belong to the same stellar population, which hints at a
possibility that the Northern Spur and the Giant Stream have the same origin.
This may be explained by the stellar orbit proposed by Merrett et al. Judging
from the position and kinematics, we emphasize that M32 might be responsible
for the two substructures. Deep spectroscopy of PNe in M32 will help to assess

CDFs has some advantages, both from the copula perspective (e.g., it is
well-defined for any dimensionality) and from general multivariate analysis
(e.g., it provides models where small dimensional marginal distributions can be
easily read-off from the parameters). Independently, Huang and Frey (J Mach

for computing the likelihood function of such models. Such schemes allows
models to be estimated with likelihood-based methods. We discuss and
demonstrate MCMC approaches for estimating such models in a Bayesian context,
their application in copula modeling, and how message-passing can be strongly

Planck mass allows a larger Hubble constant $H_0$, which is more compatible
with the local direct measurements. At the perturbative level, for cosmic
microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, an increasing effective Planck mass
($i$) suppresses the unlensed CMB power at $\ell \lesssim 30$ via the
integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and ($ii$) enhances CMB lensing power. Both
effects slightly relax the tension between the current CMB data from the Planck
satellite and the standard $\Lambda$CDM model predictions. However, those
impacts on the CMB secondary anisotropies are subdominant, and the overall
constraints are driven by the background measurements. Combining CMB data from
the Planck satellite and an $H_0$ prior from Riess $et$ $al$, we find a $\sim

disks when disk turbulence is excited by magnetorotational instabilities
(MRIs). In the accretion, disk surfaces where MRIs fully operate have a high
value of disk accretion rate ($\dot{M}$), while the disk midplane where MRIs
are generally quenched ends up with a low value of $\dot{M}$. Significant
progress on understanding MRIs has recently been made by a number of dedicated
MHD simulations, which requires improvement of the classical treatment of
$\alpha$ in 1D disk models. To this end, we obtain a new expression of $\alpha$
by utilizing an empirical formula that is derived from recent MHD simulations
of stratified disks with Ohmic diffusion. It is interesting that this new
formulation can be regarded as a general extension of the classical $\alpha$.
Armed with the new $\alpha$, we perform a linear stability analysis of
protoplanetary disks that undergo layered accretion, and find that a viscous
instability can occur around the outer edge of dead zones. Disks become stable
in using the classical $\alpha$. We identify that the difference arises from
$\Sigma-$dependence of $\dot{M}$; whereas $\Sigma$ is uniquely determined for a
given value of $\dot{M}$ in the classical approach, the new approach leads to
$\dot{M}$ that is a multi-valued function of $\Sigma$. We confirm our finding
both by exploring a parameter space as well as by performing the 1D, viscous
evolution of disks. We finally discuss other non-ideal MHD effects that are not
included in our analysis, but may affect our results.

  within the Lipkin method","7 pages, 10 figures, version submitted to Physical Review C",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Nuclear self-consistent mean-field approaches are rooted in the
density functional theory and, through the spontaneous symmetry breaking
mechanism, allow for including important correlations, while keeping the
simplicity of the approach. Because real ground states should have all
symmetries of the nuclear Hamiltonian, these methods require subsequent
symmetry restoration.
  Purpose: We implement and study Lipkin method of approximate variation after
projection applied to the restoration of the translational or rotational
symmetries.
  Methods: We use Lipkin operators up to quadratic terms in momenta or angular
momenta with self-consistently determined values of the Peierls-Yoccoz
translational masses or moments of inertia, respectively. Calculations based on
Skyrme energy-density functional are performed for heavy, deformed, and paired
nuclei.
  Results: In deformed nuclei, the Peierls-Yoccoz translational masses along
three different principal-axes directions of the intrinsic system can be
different, which illustrates different widths of the total-momentum
distributions. Numerically, the differences are only of the order of a few per
cent. For the rotational-symmetry restoration, the Lipkin method compares
favorably with the exact angular-momentum projection, which requires much
larger computational effort.
  Conclusions: The Lipkin method of translational and rotational symmetry
restoration is a practical low-cost method of determining the corresponding
correlation energies. It allows for a simultaneous restoration of several
symmetries and can be relatively easily implemented in the standard
self-consistent mean-field calculations, including those required for the
parameter adjustments.

their importance in a given environment. Results from a simulation of
radiative-convective equilibrium over the ocean show that parcels reach their

reduces the inhibition encountered by parcels before they reach their level of

both stars have the same effective temperature of 6030 +/- 150K. Evolutionary

is likely that future improved temperature estimates will move the stable giant

has been the microcanonical ensemble, which provides a way of calculating the
thermodynamic entropy for a specified energy. A controversy has recently
emerged between two distinct definitions of the entropy based on the
microcanonical ensemble: (1) The Boltzmann entropy, defined by the density of
states at a specified energy, and (2) The Gibbs entropy, defined by the sum or
integral of the density of states below a specified energy. A critical
difference between the consequences of these definitions pertains to the
concept of negative temperatures, which by the Gibbs definition, cannot exist.
In this paper, we call into question the fundamental assumption that the
microcanonical ensemble should be used to define the entropy. Our argument is
based on a recently proposed canonical definition of the entropy as a function
of energy. We investigate the predictions of the Boltzmann, Gibbs, and
canonical definitions for a variety of classical and quantum models, including
models which exhibit a first-order phase transition. Our results support the
validity of the concept of negative temperature, but not for all models with a
decreasing density of states. We find that only the canonical entropy
consistently predicts the correct thermodynamic properties, while
microcanonical definitions of entropy, including those of Boltzmann and Gibbs,
are correct only for a limited set of simple models.

interpolation mechanisms that interpolate between non-truthful and truthful
protocols. Specifically, an interpolation mechanism has two phases. In the
first phase, the bidders participate in some non-truthful protocol whose output
is itself a truthful protocol. In the second phase, the bidders participate in
the truthful protocol selected during phase one. Note that virtually all
existing auctions have either a non-existent first phase (and are therefore
truthful mechanisms), or a non-existent second phase (and are therefore just
traditional protocols, analyzed via the Price of Anarchy/Stability).
  The goal of this paper is to understand the benefits of interpolation
mechanisms versus truthful mechanisms or traditional protocols, and develop the
necessary tools to formally study them. Interestingly, we exhibit settings
where interpolation mechanisms greatly outperform the optimal traditional and
truthful protocols. Yet, we also exhibit settings where interpolation
mechanisms are provably no better than truthful ones. Finally, we apply our new
machinery to prove that the recent single-bid mechanism of Devanur et.
al.~\cite{DevanurMSW15} (the only pre-existing interpolation mechanism in the
literature) achieves the optimal price of anarchy among a wide class of
protocols, a claim that simply can't be addressed by appealing just to
machinery from communication complexity or the study of truthful mechanisms.

be a source of enhanced emissions and to play a role in the secular evolution

region of the stellar wind, which leads to efficient transfers of energy and
angular momentum between the star and the planet. We model the magnetic
interactions occurring in close-in star-planet systems with three-dimensional,
global, compressible magneto-hydrodynamic numerical simulations of a planet
orbiting in a self-consistent stellar wind. We focus on the cases of magnetized

enhanced emissions in star-planet systems. Our results suggest a simple
geometrical explanation for ubiquitous on/off enhanced emissions associated

the order of $10^{19}$ W. Close-in planets are also showed to migrate due to
magnetic torques for sufficiently strong stellar wind magnetic fields. The
topology of the interaction significantly modifies the shape of the magnetic
obstacle that leads to magnetic torques. As a consequence, the torques can vary

negative selection of mutations in coding regions is elusive and significance
of negative selection in non-coding regions remains controversial.
  Here we present analysis of transcription factors with binding sites
co-localized with non-coding variants. To avoid statistical bias we account for
mutation signatures of different cancer types. For many transcription factors,
including multiple members of FOX, HOX, and NR families, we show that human
cancers accumulate fewer mutations than expected by chance that increase or
decrease affinity of binding motifs. Such conservation of motifs is even more
exhibited in DNase accessible regions.

redshifts. In this work we simulate the pairwise kSZ signal of clusters at z<1,
using the output from a cosmological N-body simulation and including the
properties of the intra-cluster gas via a model that can be varied in
post-processing. We find that modifications to the gas profile due to star
formation and feedback reduce the pairwise kSZ amplitude of clusters by ~50%,

mis-centering can reduce the overall amplitude of the pairwise kSZ signal by up

image understanding that still does not have a satisfactory solution. In this
paper, we address this problem by exploiting the power of deep convolutional
neural networks pre-trained on large-scale image-level classification tasks. We
propose a weakly supervised deep detection architecture that modifies one such
network to operate at the level of image regions, performing simultaneously
region selection and classification. Trained as an image classifier, the
architecture implicitly learns object detectors that are better than
alternative weakly supervised detection systems on the PASCAL VOC data. The
model, which is a simple and elegant end-to-end architecture, outperforms
standard data augmentation and fine-tuning techniques for the task of
image-level classification as well.

galaxy groups. In simulations, they are predicted to assemble their mass at
high redshift. This early formation allows for the innermost $M^\ast$ galaxies
to merge into a massive central galaxy. Then, they are expected to maintain
their fossil status because of the few interactions with the large-scale
structure. In this context, the magnitude gap between the two brightest
galaxies of the system is considered a good indicator of its dynamical status.
As a consequence, the systems with the largest gaps should be dynamically
relaxed. In order to examine the dynamical status of these systems, we
systematically analyze, for the first time, the presence of galaxy
substructures in a sample of 12 spectroscopically-confirmed fossil systems with
redshift $z \le 0.25$. We apply a number of tests in order to investigate the
substructure in fossil systems in the two-dimensional space of projected
positions out to $R_{200}$. Moreover, for a subsample of 5 systems with at
least 30 spectroscopically-confirmed members we also analyze the substructure
in the velocity and in the three-dimensional velocity-position spaces.
Additionally, we look for signs of recent mergers in the regions around the
central galaxies. We find that an important fraction of fossil systems show
substructure. The fraction depends critically on the adopted test, since each
test is more sensible to a particular type of substructure. Our interpretation
of the results is that fossil systems are not, in general, as relaxed as
expected from simulations. Our sample of 12 spectroscopically-confirmed fossil
systems need to be extended in order to compute an accurate fraction, but our
conclusion is that it is similar to the fraction of substructure detected in
non-fossil clusters. THIS ABSTRACT IS TRUNCATED.

$2\times10^{-8}$, two orders of magnitudes better than previous estimates. We
determine, for the first time, a highly significant rate of decrease of the

one order of magnitude larger than expected from conservative mass transfer and
angular momentum losses due to gravitational waves and magnetic breaking, and
might result from non-conservative mass transfer. Imprinted on the long term
evolution of the orbit, we observe highly significant eclipse leads-delays of
~10-20 s, characterised by a clear state dependence in which, on average,
eclipses occur earlier during the hard state.

spectrometers has become increasingly attractive since the advent of
diffraction-limited adaptive optics systems on large-aperture telescopes.
Spectrometers fed with these fibers can be made significantly smaller than
typical 'seeing-limited' instruments, greatly reducing cost and overall
complexity. Importantly, classical mode interference and speckle issues
associated with multi-mode fibers, also known as 'modal noise', are mitigated
when using SMFs, which also provide perfect radial and azimuthal image
scrambling. However, these fibers do support multiple polarization modes, an
issue that is generally ignored for larger-core fibers given the large number
of propagation modes. Since diffraction gratings used in most high resolution
astronomical instruments have dispersive properties that are sensitive to
incident polarization changes, any birefringence variations in the fiber can
cause variations in the efficiency profile, degrading illumination stability.
Here we present a cautionary note outlining how the polarization properties of
SMFs can affect the radial velocity measurement precision of high resolution
spectrographs. This work is immediately relevant to the rapidly expanding field
of diffraction-limited, extreme precision RV spectrographs that are currently
being designed and built by a number of groups.

are then matched through a subsequent inflationary epoch driven by the
inflaton. We quantify the amount of fine-tuning of the proposed inflation

sufficiently intense flux, the bottlenecks to the physics reach of this

background and, particularly, attaining a sufficient level of charge
identification. We thus present our results as a function of these two factors.
As for the detector, we consider a very massive Gd-doped Water Cherenkov
detector. We find that MOMENT will be competitive with other currently planned
future oscillation experiments if a charge identification of at least 80 % can
be achieved at the same time that the atmospheric background can be suppressed
by at least a factor of ten. We also find a large synergy of MOMENT with the
current generation of neutrino oscillation experiments, T2K and NOvA, which
significantly enhances its final sensitivity.

find that $\sim90\%$ of planet candidates in our sample come from a population
with an eccentricity distribution characterized by a small dispersion
($\sim0.01$), and $\sim10\%$ come from a population with a larger dispersion
($\sim0.22$). Finally, we investigate how the eccentricity distribution
correlates with selected planet and host star parameters. We find evidence that
suggests systems around higher metallicity stars and planet candidates with
smaller radii come from a more complex eccentricity distribution.

from three deep near-infrared-selected surveys (ZFOURGE/CANDELS, UDS, and
UltraVISTA), which allows us to select a stellar-mass complete sample of
satellites with $\log(M_{\mathrm{sat}}/M_{\odot})>9.3$. Satellites for both
star-forming and quiescent central galaxies have higher quiescent fractions
compared to field galaxies matched in stellar mass at all redshifts. We also
observe ""galactic conformity"": satellites around quiescent centrals are more
likely to be quenched compared to the satellites around star-forming centrals.
In our sample, this conformity signal is significant at $\gtrsim3\sigma$ for
$0.6<z<1.6$, whereas it is only weakly significant at $0.3<z<0.6$ and
$1.6<z<2.5$. Therefore, conformity (and therefore satellite quenching) has been
present for a significant fraction of the age of the universe. The satellite
quenching efficiency increases with increasing stellar mass of the central, but
does not appear to depend on the stellar mass of the satellite to the mass
limit of our sample. When we compare the satellite quenching efficiency of
star-forming centrals with stellar masses 0.2 dex higher than quiescent
centrals (which should account for any difference in halo mass), the conformity
signal decreases, but remains statistically significant at $0.6<z<0.9$. This is
evidence that satellite quenching is connected to the star-formation properties
of the central as well as to the mass of the halo. We discuss physical effects
that may contribute to galactic conformity, and emphasize that they must allow
for continued star-formation in the central galaxy even as the satellites are
quenched.

before the emergence, the magnetic twist at the kinked apex of the tube is
greatly reduced, although the other parts of the tube is still strongly
twisted. This leads to the formation of a complex quadrupole structure: a pair
of the coherent, strongly twisted spots and a narrow complex bipolar pair
between it. The quadrupole is formed by the submergence of a portion of emerged
magnetic fields. This result is relevant for understanding of the origin of the
complex multipolar $\delta$-spot regions that have a strong magnetic shear and

underlies the power-law for the optical conductivity and $T-$linear resistivity
in the cuprates, we demonstrate here how a scale-invariant or unparticle sector

continuous mass formalism or multi band (flavor) formalism of the unparticle
sector by letting various microscopic parameters be mass-dependent. In
particular, we show that an effective mass that varies with the flavor index as
well as a running band edge and lifetime capture the AC and DC transport
phenomenology of the cuprates. A key consequence of the running mass is that
the effective dynamical exponent can differ from the underlying bare critical
exponent, thereby providing a mechanism for realizing the fractional values of
the dynamical exponent required in a previous analysis\cite{ Hartnoll:2015sea}.
We also predict that regardless of the bare dynamical exponent, $z$, a non-zero
anomalous dimension for the current is required. Physically, the anomalous
dimension arises because the charge depends on the flavor, mass or energy. The
equivalent phenomenon in a $d+1$ gravitational construction is the running of
the charge along the radial direction. The nature of the superconducting
instability in the presence of scale invariant stuff shows that the transition
temperature is not necessarily a monotonic function of the pairing interaction.

intact, without tidal disruption, suggesting the pair will remain dark to
telescopes. Even without tidal disruption, electromagnetic luminosity is
generated from the battery phase of the binary when the BH interacts with the
NS magnetic field. Originally the luminosity was expected in high-energy X-rays
or gamma-rays, however we conjecture that some of the battery power is emitted
in the radio bandwidth. While the luminosity and timescale are suggestive of
fast radio bursts (FRBs; millisecond-scale radio transients) NS--BH coalescence
rates are too low to make these a primary FRB source. Instead, we propose the
transients form a FRB sub-population, distinguishable by a double peak with a
precursor. The rapid ramp-up in luminosity manifests as a precursor to the
burst which is $20\%-80\%$ as luminous, given 0.5~ms timing resolution. The
main burst is from the peak luminosity before merger. The post-merger burst
follows from the NS magnetic field migration to the BH, causing a shock. NS--BH
pairs are especially desirable for ground-based gravitational wave (GW)
observatories since the pair might not otherwise be detected, with
electromagnetic counterparts greatly augmenting the scientific leverage beyond
the GW signal. Valuably, the electromagnetic signal can break degeneracies in
the parameters encoded in the GW as well as probe the NS magnetic field
strength, yielding insights into open problems in NS magnetic field decay.

evolution of galaxies, groups, and clusters. I review how AGN feedback is
tightly coupled with the formation of multiphase gas and the newly probed
chaotic cold accretion (CCA). In a turbulent and heated atmosphere, cold clouds
and kpc-scale filaments condense out of the plasma via thermal instability and
rain toward the black hole. In the nucleus, the recurrent chaotic collisions
between the cold clouds, filaments, and central torus promote angular momentum
cancellation or mixing, boosting the accretion rate up to 100 times the Bondi
rate. The rapid variability triggers powerful AGN outflows, which quench the
cooling flow and star formation without destroying the cool core. The AGN
heating stifles the formation of multiphase gas and accretion, the feedback
subsides and the hot halo is allowed to cool again, restarting a new cycle.
Ultimately, CCA creates a symbiotic link between the black hole and the whole
host via a tight self-regulated feedback which preserves the gaseous halo in
global thermal equilibrium throughout cosmic time.

However, most probabilistic image models have insufficient capability of

demonstrating that 1) using our method as a regularizer enables us to generate

AGNs and hard X-ray background. Taking into account inverse Compton processes,
in the context of the simulation-produced coronal gas, our model can readily
account for the wide variety of AGN spectral shape, which can now be understood
physically. The distinguishing feature of our model is that X-ray coronal gas
is, for the first time, an integral part of the inflow gas and its observable
characteristics are physically coupled to the concomitant inflow gas. One
natural prediction of our model is the anti-correlation between accretion disk
luminosity and spectral hardness: as the luminosity of SMBH accretion disk
decreases, the hard X-ray luminosity increases relative to the UV/optical

planet $\beta$ Pic b, which is 9 AU from and embedded in the debris disk of the
young nearby A6V star $\beta$ Pictoris. We observed the system with first light
of the Magellan Adaptive Optics (MagAO) system. In Paper I we presented the

Atmosphere models demonstrate the planet is cloudy but are degenerate in

integrating to find log($L_{bol}$/$L_{Sun}$) $= -3.78\pm0.03$. From our
bolometric luminosity and an age of 23$\pm$3 Myr, hot-start evolutionary tracks
give a mass of 12.7$\pm$0.3 $M_{Jup}$, radius of 1.45$\pm$0.02 $R_{Jup}$, and

transition around $H_g \sim 9$ to either a knee with a shallow slope or to a
divot, which is a differential drop followed by second exponential
distribution. Our analysis is based on a sample of 22 scattering TNOs drawn
from three different TNO surveys, the Canada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey
(CFEPS, Petit et al. 2011), Alexandersen et al. (2014), and the Outer Solar
System Origins Survey (OSSOS, Bannister et al. 2016), all of which provide well
characterized detection thresholds, combined with a cosmogonic model for the
formation of the scattering TNO population. Our measured absolute magnitude
distribution result is independent of the choice of cosmogonic model. Based on
our analysis, we estimate that number of scattering TNOs is (2.4-8.3)$\times
10^5$ for $H_r < 12$. A divot $H$-distribution is seen in a variety of
formation scenarios and may explain several puzzles in Kuiper Belt science. We
find that a divot $H$-distribution simultaneously explains the observed
scattering TNO, Neptune Trojan, Plutino, and Centaur $H$-distributions while
simultaneously predicting a large enough scattering TNO population to act as
the sole supply of the Jupiter-Family Comets.

  For an asymmetric variant of this problem (where one of the Senders transmits

graphs (digraphs). Let $G$ be a digraph with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices, and
let $G\setminus e$ be the digraph obtained after deleting edge $e$ from $G$. As
a first result, we show how to compute in $O(m+n)$ worst-case time: $(i)$ The
total number of strongly connected components in $G\setminus e$, for all edges
$e$ in $G$. $(ii)$ The size of the largest and of the smallest strongly
connected components in $G\setminus e$, for all edges $e$ in $G$.
  Let $G$ be strongly connected. We say that edge $e$ separates two vertices
$x$ and $y$, if $x$ and $y$ are no longer strongly connected in $G\setminus e$.
As a second set of results, we show how to build in $O(m+n)$ time $O(n)$-space
data structures that can answer in optimal time the following basic
connectivity queries on digraphs: $(i)$ Report in $O(n)$ worst-case time all
the strongly connected components of $G\setminus e$, for a query edge $e$.
$(ii)$ Test whether an edge separates two query vertices in $O(1)$ worst-case
time. $(iii)$ Report all edges that separate two query vertices in optimal
worst-case time, i.e., in time $O(k)$, where $k$ is the number of separating
edges. (For $k=0$, the time is $O(1)$).
  All of the above results extend to vertex failures. All our bounds are tight
and are obtained with a common algorithmic framework, based on a novel compact
representation of the decompositions induced by the $1$-connectivity (i.e.,
$1$-edge and $1$-vertex) cuts in digraphs, which might be of independent
interest. With the help of our data structures we can design efficient
algorithms for several other connectivity problems on digraphs and we can also
obtain in linear time a strongly connected spanning subgraph of $G$ with $O(n)$
edges that maintains the $1$-connectivity cuts of $G$ and the decompositions
induced by those cuts.

spontaneous rippling due to thermal fluctuations at a finite temperature. When
a graphene membrane is placed on a solid substrate, the adhesive interactions
between graphene and the substrate could considerably suppress thermal
rippling. On the other hand, the statistical nature of thermal rippling adds an
entropic contribution to the graphene-substrate interactions. In this paper we
present a statistical mechanics analysis on thermal rippling of monolayer
graphene supported on a rigid substrate, assuming a generic form of van der
Waals interactions between graphene and substrate at T = 0 K. The rippling
amplitude, the equilibrium average separation, and the average interaction
energy are predicted simultaneously and compared with molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. While the amplitude of thermal rippling is reduced by adhesive
interactions, the entropic contribution leads to an effective repulsion. As a
result, the equilibrium average separation increases and the effective adhesion
energy decreases with increasing temperature. Moreover, the effect of a biaxial
pre-strain in graphene is considered, and a buckling instability is predicted
at a critical compressive strain that depends on both the temperature and the
adhesive interactions. Limited by the harmonic approximations, the theoretical
predictions agree with MD simulations only for relatively small rippling
amplitudes but can be extended to account for the anharmonic effects.

resulting in the notion of single-sorted $\mathcal{V}$-enriched
$\mathcal{J}$-cotensor theory, or $\mathcal{J}$-theory for short. For suitable

We identify a modest condition on $j$ that entails that the

$\mathcal{V}$ for every $\mathcal{J}$-theory $\mathcal{T}$, even when
$\mathcal{T}$ is not small and $\mathcal{V}$ is neither complete nor
cocomplete. We show that $j$ satisfies this condition if and only if $j$
presents $\mathcal{V}$ as a free cocompletion of $\mathcal{J}$ with respect to
the weights for left Kan extensions along $j$, and so we call such systems of

system may be equivalently described as (i) monads in a certain one-object
bicategory of profunctors on $\mathcal{J}$, and (ii) $\mathcal{V}$-monads on

suitable (admissible) frame, even when the sampling frame is only weakly

would be impossible to realize in a purely $d-1$ dimensional system i.e.,
without the bulk. This is often formalized by saying the $G$ symmetry is
anomalous when the boundary theory is gauged. Simultaneously gauging the
symmetry on the boundary and in the bulk yields a gauge-invariant composite
system. One says there is an anomaly in-flow from the boundary to the bulk.
Recently it has been appreciated that some anomalies are too severe to be
regulated by an SPT bulk. These do not satisfy anomaly in-flow in the
traditional sense. However, we show that these anomalous systems can be
regulated as the symmetric boundaries of the newly discovered higher SPT
phases. These higher SPT's are protected by a symmetry $d$-group, a higher
categorical version of a group which can charge not just particles but also

higher-form gauge field when $G$ is gauged, and this gauge field participates

refractive index m+i\kappa and small dissipative constant \kappa is presented.
We have shown that there is a dramatic difference in the behavior of the
electromagnetic field within the particle (inner problem) and the scattered
field outside it (outer problem). With an increase in m at fix values of the
other parameters, the field within the particle asymptotically converges to a
periodic function of m. The electric and magnetic type Mie resonances of
different orders overlap substantially. It may lead to a giant concentration of
the electromagnetic energy within the particle. At the same time, we
demonstrate that identical transformations of the solution for the outer
problem allow to present each partial scattered wave as a sum of two
partitions. One of them corresponds to the m-independent wave, scattered by a
perfectly reflecting particle and plays the role of a background, while the
other is associated with the excitation of a sharply-m-dependent resonant Mie
mode. The interference of the partitions brings about a typical asymmetric Fano
profile. The explicit expressions for the parameters of the Fano profile have
been obtained ""from the first principles"" without any additional assumptions
and/or fitting. In contrast to the inner problem, at an increase in m the
resonant modes of the outer problem die out, and the scattered field converges
to the universal, m-independent profile of the perfectly reflecting sphere.
Numerical estimates of the discussed effects for a gallium phosphide particle
are presented.

oscillatory modes od the charged particle dynamics provides mechanism for
charged particle acceleration along the magnetic field lines. This energy
transmutation is an attribute of the chaotic charged particle dynamics in the
combined gravitational and magnetic fields only, the black hole rotation is not
necessary for such charged particle acceleration. The chaotic scatter can cause
transition to the motion along the magnetic field lines with small radius of
the Larmor motion or vanishing Larmor radius, when the speed of the particle
translational motion is largest and can be ultra-relativistic. We discuss
consequences of the model of ionization of test particles forming a neutral
accretion disc, or heavy ions following off-equatorial circular orbits, and we
explore the fate of heavy charged test particles after ionization where no kick

  Channels and its Implications",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter wave (mmWave) has great potential in realizing high data rate
thanks to the large spectral channels. It is considered as a key technology for
the fifth generation wireless networks and is already used in wireless LAN
(e.g., IEEE 802.11ad). Using mmWave for vehicular communications, however, is
often viewed with some skepticism due to a misconception that the Doppler
spread would become too large at these high frequencies. This is not true when
directional beam is employed for communications. In this paper, closed form
expressions relating the channel coherence time and beamwidth are derived.
Unlike prior work that assumed perfect beam pointing, the pointing error due to
the receiver motion is incorporated to show that there exists a non-zero
optimal beamwidth that maximizes the coherence time. To investigate the
mobility effect on the beam alignment which is an important feature in mmWave
systems, a novel concept of beam coherence time is defined. The beam coherence
time, which is an effective measure of beam alignment frequency, is shown to be
much larger than the conventional channel coherence time and thus results in
reduced beam alignment overhead. Using the derived correlation function, the
channel coherence time, and the beam coherence time, an overall performance
metric considering both the channel time-variation and the beam alignment
overhead is derived. Using this metric, it is shown that beam alignment in
every beam coherence time performs better than the beam alignment in every
channel coherence time due to the large overhead for the latter case.

15^\circ$ region about the direction of the GC, and implications for the
interstellar emissions produced by cosmic ray (CR) particles interacting with
the gas and radiation fields in the inner Galaxy and for the point sources
detected. Specialised interstellar emission models (IEMs) are constructed that
enable separation of the gamma-ray emission from the inner $\sim 1$ kpc about
the GC from the fore- and background emission from the Galaxy. Based on these
models, the interstellar emission from CR electrons interacting with the
interstellar radiation field via the inverse Compton (IC) process and CR nuclei
inelastically scattering off the gas producing gamma-rays via $\pi^0$ decays
from the inner $\sim 1$ kpc is determined. The IC contribution is found to be
dominant in the region and strongly enhanced compared to previous studies. A
catalog of point sources for the $15^\circ \times 15^\circ$ region is
self-consistently constructed using these IEMs: the First Fermi-LAT Inner
Galaxy point source Catalog (1FIG). After subtracting the interstellar emission
and point-source contributions from the data a residual is found that is a
sub-dominant fraction of the total flux. If spatial templates that peak toward
the GC are used to model the positive residual and included in the total model
for the $15^\circ \times 15^\circ$ region, the agreement with the data
improves, but none of the additional templates account for all of the residual
structure. The spectrum of the positive residual modelled with these templates
has a strong dependence on the choice of IEM. [Abridged]

ExtraPush can iterate with a fixed step size. But unlike Extra, they can take a

Therefore, they remove the undirected-network restriction of Extra.
Subgradient-push, while also works for directed networks, is slower on the same
type of problem because it must use a sequence of diminishing step sizes.
  We present preliminary analysis for ExtraPush under a bounded sequence
assumption. For Normalized ExtraPush, we show that it naturally produces a
bounded, linearly convergent sequence provided that the objective function is
strongly convex.
  In our numerical experiments, ExtraPush and Normalized ExtraPush performed
similarly well. They are significantly faster than subgradient-push, even when

calibrators, in particular DA white dwarfs, are not available. We argue that
A-type stars offer a useful alternative and reliable space-based
spectrophotometry is now available for a number of bright ones in the range
3<V<8 mag. By means of comparing observed spectrophotometry and model fluxes,
we identify 18 new very-bright trustworthy A-type flux standards for the
optical range (400-800 nm), and provide scaled model fluxes for them. Our tests
suggest that the absolute fluxes for these stars in the optical are reliable to
within 3%. We limit the spectral range to 400-800 nm, since our models have
difficulties to reproduce the observed fluxes in the near-infrared and,
especially, in the near-UV, where the discrepancies rise up to ~ 10%. Based on
our model fits, we derive angular diameters with an estimated accuracy of about
1%.

decrease the total training time for a neural network while maintaining the
final performance, which motivates its use on deep neural networks. By
partitioning the training task in multiple training subtasks with sub-models,
which can be performed independently and in parallel, it is shown that the size
of the sub-models reduces almost quadratically with the number of subtasks
created, quickly scaling down the sub-models used for the pre-training. The
sub-models are then merged to provide a pre-trained initial set of weights for
the original model. The proposed method is independent of the other aspects of
the training, such as architecture of the neural network, training method, and
objective, making it compatible with a wide range of existing approaches. The
speedup without loss of performance is validated experimentally on MNIST and on
CIFAR10 data sets, also showing that even performing the subtasks sequentially
can decrease the training time. Moreover, we show that larger models may
present higher speedups and conjecture about the benefits of the method in
distributed learning systems.

type checking to run time. VM implementations can improve performance by
eliminating redundant dynamic type checks. However, type inference analyses are
often costly and involve tradeoffs between compilation time and resulting
precision. This has lead to the creation of increasingly complex multi-tiered
VM architectures.
  Lazy basic block versioning is a simple JIT compilation technique which
effectively removes redundant type checks from critical code paths. This novel
approach lazily generates type-specialized versions of basic blocks on-the-fly
while propagating context-dependent type information. This approach does not
require the use of costly program analyses, is not restricted by the precision
limitations of traditional type analyses.
  This paper extends lazy basic block versioning to propagate type information
interprocedurally, across function call boundaries. Our implementation in a
JavaScript JIT compiler shows that across 26 benchmarks, interprocedural basic
block versioning eliminates more type tag tests on average than what is
achievable with static type analysis without resorting to code transformations.
On average, 94.3% of type tag tests are eliminated, yielding speedups of up to
56%. We also show that our implementation is able to outperform Truffle/JS on
several benchmarks, both in terms of execution time and compilation time.

presence of a one-dimensional bichromatic optical lattice with external

this purpose, the time-dependent Gross Pitaevskii equation is solved using the
Crank Nicolson method in real time. Two realizations of the optical lattice are
considered, one with a rational and the other with an irrational ratio of the
two constituting wave lengths. For a weak bichromatic optical lattice, the
long-time averaged physical observables of the condensate respond only very
weakly (or not at all) to changes in the secondary optical lattice depth.
However, for a much larger strength of the latter optical lattice, the response
is stronger. It is found that qualitatively there is no difference between the
dynamics of the condensate resulting from the use of a rational or irrational
ratio of the optical lattice wavelengths since the external harmonic trap
washes it out. It is further found that in the presence of an external harmonic
trap, the bichromatic optical lattice acts in favor of superflow.

  Cloud Online Services","10 pages, 9 figures, ICPP conference",,"10.1109/ICPP.2015.58",,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern latency-critical online services often rely on composing results from
a large number of server components. Hence the tail latency (e.g. the 99th
percentile of response time), rather than the average, of these components
determines the overall service performance. When hosted on a cloud environment,
the components of a service typically co-locate with short batch jobs to
increase machine utilizations, and share and contend resources such as caches
and I/O bandwidths with them. The highly dynamic nature of batch jobs in terms
of their workload types and input sizes causes continuously changing
performance interference to individual components, hence leading to their
latency variability and high tail latency. However, existing techniques either
ignore such fine-grained component latency variability when managing service
performance, or rely on executing redundant requests to reduce the tail
latency, which adversely deteriorate the service performance when load gets
heavier. In this paper, we propose PCS, a predictive and component-level
scheduling framework to reduce tail latency for large-scale, parallel online
services. It uses an analytical performance model to simultaneously predict the
component latency and the overall service performance on different nodes. Based
on the predicted performance, the scheduler identifies straggling components
and conducts near-optimal component-node allocations to adapt to the changing
performance interferences from batch jobs. We demonstrate that, using realistic
workloads, the proposed scheduler reduces the component tail latency by an
average of 67.05\% and the average overall service latency by 64.16\% compared
with the state-of-the-art techniques on reducing tail latency.

that ensures the non-existence of fixed modes when the

Additionally, we address the minimum actuation-sensing-communication co-design

show to be NP-hard. Notwithstanding, we identify conditions that are often

related to the black-hole angular-momentum by the simple Kerr-like (vacuum)
relation
$\Omega^{\text{Kerr}}_{\text{H}}(J_{\text{H}})=J_{\text{H}}/2M^2R_{\text{H}}$.
Will has performed a perturbative treatment of the composed black-hole-ring

relation
$\Omega^{\text{BH-ring}}_{\text{H}}(J_{\text{H}}=0,J_{\text{R}},R)=2J_{\text{R}}/R^3$
for the angular-velocity of a central black hole with zero angular-momentum.
Analyzing a sequence of black-hole-ring configurations with adiabatically

non-zero angular momenta. Remarkably, we find the simple universal relation

establishing a phase boundary between the Mott insulator and topological

establish a general setup for anamorphosis and central perspective, define the
total spherical perspective within this framework, study its topology, and show
how to solve it with simple instruments. We consider its uses both in freehand
drawing and in computer visualization, and its relation with the problem of
reflection on a sphere.

associated computational guarantees for solving convex optimization problems

optimization problem $f^* = \min_{x \in Q} f(x)$, where we presume knowledge of
a strict lower bound $f_{\mathrm{slb}} < f^*$. [Indeed, $f_{\mathrm{slb}}$ is
naturally known when optimizing many loss functions in statistics and machine
learning (least-squares, logistic loss, exponential loss, total variation loss,
etc.) as well as in Renegar's transformed version of the standard conic
optimization problem; in all these cases one has $f_{\mathrm{slb}} = 0 < f^*$.]
We introduce a new functional measure called the growth constant $G$ for
$f(\cdot)$, that measures how quickly the level sets of $f(\cdot)$ grow
relative to the function value, and that plays a fundamental role in the
complexity analysis. When $f(\cdot)$ is non-smooth, we present new
computational guarantees for the Subgradient Descent Method and for smoothing
methods, that can improve existing computational guarantees in several ways,
most notably when the initial iterate $x^0$ is far from the optimal solution
set. When $f(\cdot)$ is smooth, we present a scheme for periodically restarting
the Accelerated Gradient Method that can also improve existing computational
guarantees when $x^0$ is far from the optimal solution set, and in the presence
of added structure we present a scheme using parametrically increased smoothing
that further improves the associated computational guarantees.

clusters whose width depends only on the noise level. We introduce an order

larger R. Based on the stability analysis of the mean-field equation, we derive
the existence of a forbidden zone for the disordered phase to emerge. We also
provide a theoretical explanation for the well-known 2R conjecture, which
states that, for a random initial distribution in a fixed interval, the final

CV estimator over the estimated from the data variance. The variance and the
covariance of different average test set errors are independent of their
indices, thus, the resampling effectiveness depends on the correlation and the
number of repetitions used in the random CV estimator. We discuss statistical
rules to define optimality and obtain the ""optimal"" training sample size as the
solution of an appropriately formulated optimization problem. We show that in a
broad class of loss functions the optimal training size equals half of the
total sample size, independently of the data distribution. We optimally select
the number of folds in $k$-fold cross validation and offer a computational
procedure for obtaining the optimal splitting in the case of classification

We utilised MWA data obtained in a routine imaging mode from observations where
the primary target was a field being studied for Epoch of Reionisation
detection. We formed images with 2 second time resolution and 1.28~MHz
frequency resolution for 10.5 hours of observations, over 400 square degrees of
the sky. We de-dispersed the dynamic spectrum in each of 372,100 resolution
elements of 2$\times$2 arcmin$^{2}$, between dispersion measures of 170 and
675~pc~cm$^{-3}$. Based on the event rate calculations in Trott, Tingay & Wayth
(2013), which assumes a standard candle luminosity of $8\times10^{37}$
Js$^{-1}$, we predict that with this choice of observational parameters, the
MWA should detect ($\sim10$,$\sim2$,$\sim0$) FRBs with spectral indices
corresponding to ($-$2, $-$1, 0), based on a 7$\sigma$ detection threshold. We
find no FRB candidates above this threshold from our search, placing an event
rate limit of $<700$ above 700 Jy.ms per day per sky and providing evidence
against spectral indices $\alpha<-1.2$ ($S\propto\nu^{\alpha}$). We compare our
event rate and spectral index limits with others from the literature. We
briefly discuss these limits in light of recent suggestions that supergiant
pulses from young neutron stars could explain FRBs. We find that such
supergiant pulses would have to have much flatter spectra between 150 and 1400

we compare and classify multiple proposed inverse algorithms in terms of
experimental robustness. We find that the main sources of error are noise,
aberrations and mis-calibration (i.e. model mis-match). Using simulations and
experiments, we demonstrate that the choice of cost function plays a critical
role, with amplitude-based cost functions performing better than
intensity-based ones. The reason for this is that Fourier ptychography datasets
consist of images from both brightfield and darkfield illumination,
representing a large range of measured intensities. Both noise (e.g. Poisson
noise) and model mis-match errors are shown to scale with intensity. Hence,
algorithms that use an appropriate cost function will be more tolerant to both
noise and model mis-match. Given these insights, we propose a global Newton's
method algorithm which is robust and computationally efficient. Finally, we
discuss the impact of procedures for algorithmic correction of aberrations and

shown that these disks often present spiral features. Spiral arms are among the
structures predicted decades ago by numerical simulations of disk-planet
interaction and thus it is tempting to suspect that planetary perturbers are
responsible for the observed signatures. However, such interpretation is not
free of problems. The spirals are found to have large pitch angles, and in at
least one case (HD 100546) the spiral feature appears effectively unpolarized,
which implies thermal emission of the order of 1000K (465$\pm$40K at closer
inspection). We have recently shown in two-dimensional models that shock
dissipation in the supersonic wake of high-mass planets can lead to significant
heating if the disk is sufficiently adiabatic. In this paper we extend this
analysis to three dimensions in thermodynamically evolving disks. We use the
Pencil Code in spherical coordinates for our models, with a prescription for
thermal cooling based on the optical depth of the local vertical gas column. We
use a 5$M_J$ planet, and show that shocks in the region around the planet where
the Lindblad resonances occur heat the gas to substantially higher temperatures
than the ambient disk gas at that radius. The gas is accelerated vertically
away from the midplane by the shocks to form shock bores, and the gas falling
back toward the midplane breaks up into a turbulent surf near the Lindblad
resonances. This turbulence, although localized, has high $\alpha$ values,
reaching 0.05 in the inner Lindblad resonance, and 0.1 in the outer one. We
also find evidence that the disk regions heated up by the planetary shocks
eventually becomes superadiabatic, generating convection far from the planet's
orbit.

conditions in broadcast wireless communication is developed in this paper; this
problem causes the appropriate code-rate to vary across different transmitted
frames and different receivers as well. The main aspect of the proposed
approach is that it incorporates an iterative rate-matching process into the
decoding of the received set of frames, such that: throughout inter-frame
decoding, the code-rate of each frame is progressively lowered to or below the
appropriate value, prior to applying or re-applying conventional physical-layer
channel decoding on it. This iterative rate-matching process is asymptotically
analyzed in this paper. It is shown to be optimal, in the sense defined in the
paper. Consequently, the data-rates achievable by the proposed scheme are
derived. Overall, it is concluded that, compared to the existing solutions,
inter-frame coding presents a better complexity versus data-rate tradeoff. In

that are similar in type and scheduling to those employed in the relatively-
simple iterative erasure decoding. In terms of data-rates, compared to the

then numerically compute the CMB reduced bispectrum induced by passive and
compensated PMF modes on large angular scales. There is a negative signal on
the bispectrum due to the helical terms of the fields and we also observe that
the biggest contribution to the bispectrum comes from the non-zero IR cut-off
for causal fields, unlike the two-point correlation case. For negative spectral
indices, the reduced bispectrum is enhanced by the passive modes. This gives a
lower value of the upper limit for the mean amplitude of the magnetic field on
a given characteristic scale. However, high values of IR cut-off in the
bispectrum, and the helical terms of the magnetic field relaxes this bound.
This demonstrates the importance of the IR cut-off and helicity in the study of
the nature of PMFs from CMB observations.

undecidable. The case of the clock semantics is closely related to a monadic

called secondary structure, such as $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets.
Secondary structure is characterized by the local rotational state of the
protein backbone, quantified by two dihedral angles called $\phi$ and $\psi$.
Particular types of secondary structure can generally be described by a single
(diffuse) location on a two-dimensional plot drawn in the space of the angles
$\phi$ and $\psi$, called a Ramachandran plot. By contrast, a
recently-discovered nanomaterial made from peptoids, structural isomers of
peptides, displays a secondary-structure motif corresponding to two regions on
the Ramachandran plot [Mannige et al., Nature 526, 415 (2015)]. In order to
describe such `higher-order' secondary structure in a compact way we introduce
here a means of describing regions on the Ramachandran plot in terms of a
single Ramachandran number, ${\mathcal{R}}$, which is a structurally meaningful
combination of $\phi$ and $\psi$. We show that the potential applications of
${\mathcal{R}}$ are numerous: it can be used to describe the geometric content
of protein structures, and can be used to draw diagrams that reveal, at a
glance, the frequency of occurrence of regular secondary structures and
disordered regions in large protein datasets. We propose that ${\mathcal{R}}$
might be used as an order parameter for protein geometry for a wide range of
applications.

ground state of the even-even core is known to augment the single quasiparticle
fragmentation pattern. In a recent experimental study by Yordanov \emph{et al.}
the values of the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of the
$11/2^-$ state in a long chain of Cd isotopes were found to follow a simple
trend which we try to explain by means of incorporating long-range correlations
in the ground state. Purpose: Our purpose is to study the influence of the
ground-state correlations (GSC) on the magnetic moments and compare our results
with the data for the odd-A Cd isotopes.
  Method: In order to evaluate if the additional correlations have bearing on
the magnetic moments we employ an extension to the quasiparticle-phonon model
(QPM) which takes into account quasiparticle$\otimes$phonon configurations in
the ground state of the even-even core to the structure of the odd-A nucleus
wave function.
  Results: It is shown that the values for the magnetic moments which the
applied QPM extension yields deviate further from the Schmidt values. The
latter is in agreement with the measured values for the Cd isotopes.
  Conclusions: The GSC exert significant influence on the magnetic dipole
moments and reveal a potential for reproducing the experimental values for the
studied cadmium isotopes.

spin-1 Blume-Capel (BC) model and the mixed-spin Ising model demonstrate a
change of continuous phase transitions to discontinuous ones at a tricritical
point. A quantum phase transition of the spin-S Ising model driven by a
transverse field is explored within MF method. EF theory is elaborated within a
single- and two-spin cluster approach to demonstrate an efficiency of this
approximate method. The long-standing problem of this method concerned with a
self-consistent determination of the free energy is addressed. EF theory is
adapted for the spin-1/2 Ising model, the spin-S BC model and the transverse
Ising model. The particular attention is paid to continuous and discontinuous
transitions. Exact results for the spin-1/2 Ising chain, spin-1 BC chain and
mixed-spin Ising chain are obtained using the transfer-matrix method, the
crucial steps of which are reviewed for a spin-1/2 Ising square lattice.
Critical points of the spin-1/2 Ising model on several lattices are rigorously
obtained with the help of dual, star-triangle and decoration-iteration
transformations. Mapping transformations are adapted to obtain exact results
for the mixed-spin Ising model on planar lattices. An increase in the
coordination number of the mixed-spin Ising model on decorated planar lattices

considered three different fields where both radio and FIR observations are the
deepest to-date: GOODS-South, GOODS-North and the Lockman Hole. Out of a total
of 92 radio-selected AGN, ~64% are found to have a counterpart in Herschel
maps. The percentage is maximum in the GOODS-North (72%) and minimum (~50%) in
the Lockman Hole, where FIR observations are shallower. Our study shows that in
all cases FIR emission is associated to star-forming activity within the host
galaxy. Such an activity can even be extremely intense, with star-forming rates
as high as ~10^3-10^4 Msun/yr. AGN activity does not inhibit star formation in
the host galaxy, just as on-site star-formation does not seem to affect AGN
properties, at least those detected at radio wavelengths and for z>~1.
Furthermore, physical properties such as the mass and age distributions of the
galaxies hosting a radio-active AGN do not seem to be affected by the presence
of an ongoing star-forming event. Given the very high rate of FIR detections,
we stress that this refers to the majority of the sample: most radio-active AGN
are associated with intense episodes of star-formation. However, the two
processes proceed independently within the same galaxy, at all redshifts but in
the local universe, where powerful enough radio activity reaches the necessary
strength to switch off the on-site star formation. Our data also show that for
z>~1 the hosts of radio-selected star-forming galaxies and AGN are
indistinguishable from each other both in terms of mass and IR luminosity
distributions. The two populations only differentiate in the very local
universe, whereby the few AGN which are still FIR-active are found in galaxies
with much higher masses and luminosities.

convert data to application semantics and store the converted results in

front is solved analytically by using a 1D Savage-Hutter's model based on
depth-averaged mass and momentum equations with the fractional expression for
the frictional rheology $\mu(I)$. Unlike previous studies where a ""plug flow""
is assumed, a free shape factor $\alpha$ describing the vertical velocity
profile, is taken into account to determine the solution. Such a way, we put in
evidence an effect of inertia through the Froude number Fr and the shape factor
$\alpha$ on the front profile. The analytical predictions are compared with
experimental results published by [O. Pouliquen, Phys. Fluids 11, 1956 (1999)]

during reionization promise to provide a new probe of early galaxy and
structure formation. One of the challenges of modelling reionization is to
account both for the sub-halo scale physics of galaxy formation and the regions
of ionization on scales that are many orders of magnitude larger. To bridge
this gap we first calculate the statistical relationship between ionizing
luminosity and Mpc-scale overdensity using detailed models of galaxy formation
computed using relatively small volume - ($\sim$100Mpc/$h$)$^{3}$, high
resolution dark matter simulations. We then use a Monte-Carlo technique to
apply this relationship to reionization of the intergalactic medium within
large volume dark matter simulations - ($>$1Gpc/$h$)$^{3}$. The resulting
simulations can be used to address the contribution of very large scale
clustering of galaxies to the structure of reionization, and show that volumes
larger than 500Mpc/$h$ are required to probe the largest reionization features
mid-way through reionization. As an example application of our technique, we
demonstrate that the predicted 21cm power spectrum amplitude and gradient could
be used to determine the importance of supernovae feedback for early galaxy
formation.

descriptors from a large database to find a short list of candidate matches. A
good image descriptor is key to the retrieval pipeline and should reconcile two
contradictory requirements: providing recall rates as high as possible and
being as compact as possible for fast matching. Following the recent successes
of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for large scale image
classification, descriptors extracted from DCNNs are increasingly used in place
of the traditional hand crafted descriptors such as Fisher Vectors (FV) with
better retrieval performances. Nevertheless, the dimensionality of a typical
DCNN descriptor --extracted either from the visual feature pyramid or the
fully-connected layers-- remains quite high at several thousands of scalar
values. In this paper, we propose Unsupervised Triplet Hashing (UTH), a fully
unsupervised method to compute extremely compact binary hashes --in the 32-256
bits range-- from high-dimensional global descriptors. UTH consists of two
successive deep learning steps. First, Stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(SRBM), a type of unsupervised deep neural nets, are used to learn binary
embedding functions able to bring the descriptor size down to the desired
bitrate. SRBMs are typically able to ensure a very high compression rate at the
expense of loosing some desirable metric properties of the original DCNN
descriptor space. Then, triplet networks, a rank learning scheme based on
weight sharing nets is used to fine-tune the binary embedding functions to
retain as much as possible of the useful metric properties of the original
space. A thorough empirical evaluation conducted on multiple publicly available
dataset using DCNN descriptors shows that our method is able to significantly
outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised schemes in the target bit range.

anomalously large radii. Layered convection induced by compositional
inhomogeneity has been proposed to account for the radius anomaly of hot
Jupiters. To reexamine the impact of the compositional inhomogeneity, we
perform an evolutionary calculation by determining convection regime at each
evolutionary time step according to the criteria from linear analyses. It is
shown that the impact is limited in the case of the monotonic gradient of heavy
element abundance. The layered convection is absent for the first 1 Gyr from
the formation of hot Jupiters and instead overturning convection develops. The
super-adiabaticity of the temperature gradient is limited by the neutrally
stable state for the Ledoux stability criterion. The effect of the increased
mass of heavy elements essentially compensates the effect of the delayed
contraction on the planetary radius caused by compositional inhomogeneity. In
addition, even in the case where the layered convection is artificially
imposed, this mechanism requires extremely thin layers (~ 10^1-10^3 cm) to
account for the observed radius anomaly. The long-term stability of such thin
layers remains to be studied. Therefore, if the criteria adopted in this paper
are adequate, it might be difficult to explain the inflated radii of hot
Jupiters by monotonic gradient of heavy element abundance alone.

by exact recurrence relations. We find that the grand-canonical condensate

behaving qualitatively similar to an ideal gas in the canonical ensemble (or
micro-canonical ensemble) rather than the grand-canonical ensemble. For low but
finite temperatures, the fluctuations remain considerably higher than for the

ensemble, thus clearly showing that we are not in a regime in which the

currently exist on Mars, although the volume is still uncertain. Recent
analyses of Martian meteorites have suggested that the water reservoirs have at
least three distinct hydrogen isotope compositions (D/H ratios): primordial and
high D/H ratios, which are approximately the same and six times that of ocean
water on Earth, respectively, and a newly identified intermediate D/H ratio,
which is approximately two to three times higher than that in ocean water on
Earth. We calculate the evolution of the D/H ratios and the volumes of the
water reservoirs on Mars by modeling the exchange of hydrogen isotopes between
multiple water reservoirs and the atmospheric escape. The D/H ratio is slightly
higher in the topmost thin surface-ice layer than that in the atmosphere
because of isotopic fractionation by sublimation, whereas the water-ice
reservoir just below the exchangeable topmost surface layer retains the
intermediate D/H signature found in Martian meteorites. We propose two possible
models for constraining the volume of the ground ice considering the observed
D/H ratios and geomorphological estimates of Paleo-oceans. The first assumes
that the atmospheric loss is dominated by the Jeans escape. In this case, the
volume of ground ice should be larger than the total volume of the observable
surface ice that mainly occurs as polar layered ice deposits. The other model
assumes diffusion-limited atmospheric loss in which the interactive evolution
of the multiple water reservoirs naturally accounts for the observed D/H
ratios. In this scenario, a large volume of ground ice does not necessarily
exist currently on Mars as opposed to the perspective view proposed on the
basis of recent orbiter missions.

represent parameters of uncertain values in a stochastic program. Most
approaches to scenario generation are distribution-driven, that is, they
attempt to construct a random vector which captures well in a probabilistic
sense the uncertainty. On the other hand, a problem-driven approach may be able
to exploit the structure of a problem to provide a more concise representation
of the uncertainty.
  In this paper we propose an analytic approach to problem-driven scenario
generation. This approach applies to stochastic programs where a tail risk
measure, such as conditional value-at-risk, is applied to a loss function.
Since tail risk measures only depend on the upper tail of a distribution,
standard methods of scenario generation, which typically spread their scenarios
evenly across the support of the random vector, struggle to adequately
represent tail risk. Our scenario generation approach works by targeting the
construction of scenarios in areas of the distribution corresponding to the
tails of the loss distributions. We provide conditions under which our approach
is consistent with sampling, and as proof-of-concept demonstrate how our
approach could be applied to two classes of problem, namely network design and
portfolio selection. Numerical tests on the portfolio selection problem
demonstrate that our approach yields better and more stable solutions compared
to standard Monte Carlo sampling.

that the shell emission overwhelms that of the radio lobes soon after stopping
the jet energy injection because fresh electrons are continuously supplied into
the shell via the forward shock while the radio lobes rapidly fade out without
jet energy injection. We find that such fossil shells can be a new class of
target sources for SKA telescope. Next, we apply the model to the nearby radio
source 3C84. Then, we find that the fossil shell emission in 3C84 is less

graphene quantum dots (QDs) pose a major hurdle in the application of these
nanostructures for spintronic devices. }Based upon phase diagrams obtained by
employing {\normalsize{}the $\pi$-electron }Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model
Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that the magnetic states undergo phase transition
under the influence of an external electric field. Our calculations of the
electro-absorption spectra of these QDs indicate that the spectrum in question
carries strong signatures of their magnetic state (FM vs AFM), thus suggesting
the possibility of an all-optical characterization of their magnetic nature.
Further, the gaps for the up and the down spins are the same in the absence of
an external electric field, both for the antiferromagnetic (AFM), and the
ferromagnetic (FM) states of QDs. But, once the QDs are exposed to a suitably
directed external electric field, gaps for different spins split, and, exhibit
distinct variations with respect to the strength of the field. The nature of
variation exhibited by the energy gaps corresponding to the up and down spins
is different for the AFM and FM configurations of QDs. This selective
manipulation of the spin-polarized gap splitting by an electric field in finite
graphene nanostructures can open up new frontiers in the design of
graphene-based spintronic devices.

distributions or some of their moments. In its standard approach, samples are
drawn from a single proposal distribution and weighted properly. However, since
the performance depends on the mismatch between the targeted and the proposal
distributions, several proposal densities are often employed for the generation
of samples. Under this Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS) scenario, many works
have addressed the selection or adaptation of the proposal distributions,
interpreting the sampling and the weighting steps in different ways. In this
paper, we establish a general framework for sampling and weighing procedures
when more than one proposal are available. The most relevant MIS schemes in the
literature are encompassed within the new framework, and, moreover novel valid
schemes appear naturally. All the MIS schemes are compared and ranked in terms
of the variance of the associated estimators. Finally, we provide illustrative
examples which reveal that, even with a good choice of the proposal densities,
a careful interpretation of the sampling and weighting procedures can make a
significant difference in the performance of the method.

modes survive and the lower KK modes are localized near the IR brane from the

depends on the coupling parameter $\lambda$, and they will be not localized

their average speed is above an explicit threshold. This hypothesis is
satisfied in particular when the reaction term does not depend on x or (in some
cases) is small enough. Moreover, except for the threshold case, the fronts we
construct and their speeds are almost periodic, in a sense. When our hypothesis
is no longer satisfied, such generalized transition fronts still exist for an
interval of average speeds, with explicit bounds. Our proof relies on the
construction of sub and super solutions based on an accurate analysis of the
properties of the generalized principal eigenvalues.

Analytical result show that this braking torque is obviously far more than that
by magnetic dipole radiation for pulsars with spin period of $> 0.1$ s, and
play an important role during the spin-down of the pulsars. Our simulated

show that the semi-classical analysis of the massless and massive vacua depends
on the classification of nilpotent orbits, as well as on the conjugacy classes
of the component group of their centralizer. We demonstrate that
semi-classically massless vacua can be lifted by Wilson lines in unbroken
discrete gauge groups. The pseudo-Levi subalgebras that play a classifying role
in the nilpotent orbit theory are also key in defining generalized Inozemtsev
limits of (twisted) elliptic integrable systems. We illustrate our analysis in
the N=1* theories with gauge algebras su(3), su(4), so(5) and for the
exceptional gauge algebra G2. We map out modular duality diagrams of the
massive and massless vacua. Moreover, we provide an analytic description of the
branches of massless vacua in the case of the su(3) and the so(5) theory. The
description of these branches in terms of the complexified Wilson lines on the
circle invokes the Eichler-Zagier technique for inverting the elliptic
Weierstrass function. After fine-tuning the coupling to elliptic points of

is often explained by a widely accepted theory in which the photogain is
proportional to the minority carrier lifetime and inversely proportional to the
carrier transit time across the photoconductor. It occasionally misleads
scientists to believe that a high-speed and high-gain photodetector can be made
simply by shortening the device length. The theory is derived on the assumption
that the distribution of photogenerated excess carriers is spatially uniform.
In this Letter, we find that this assumption is not valid for a photoconductive
semiconductor due to the metal-semiconductor boundary at the two metal
electrodes inducing carrier confinement. By solving the continuity equation and
performing numerical simulations, we conclude that a photoconductor
intrinsically has no gain or at least no high gain, no matter how short the
transit time and how long the minority lifetime is. The high gain observed in
experiments comes from other extrinsic effects such as defects, surface states
and surface depletion regions that localize excess minority carriers, leaving a
large number of excess majority carriers accumulated in the conduction channel
for the photogain. Following the Ohm's Law, a universal equation governing the
photogain in a photoconductor is established at the end of this Letter.

the non-collinear triangular antiferromagnet Mn3Ge exhibits a large anomalous
Hall effect comparable to that of ferromagnetic metals; the magnitude of the
anomalous conductivity is 500 per ohm per cm at 2 K and 50 per ohm per cm at
room temperature. The angular dependence of the anomalous Hall effect
measurements confirm that the small residual in-plane magnetic moment has no
role in the observed effect. Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that the
large anomalous Hall effect in Mn3Ge originates from a non-vanishing Berry
curvature that arises from the chiral spin structure, and which also results in
a large spin Hall effect, comparable to that of platinum. The present results
pave the way to realize room temperature antiferromagnetic spintronics and spin

asymmetry may be explained by a large-scale mode of exceptional amplitude which
perturbs the zeta two-point function. We extend previous calculations, which
were restricted to one- or two-source scenarios, by providing a method to
compute the response of the two-point function in any model yielding a
'local-like' bispectrum. In general, this shows that it is not the reduced
bispectrum fNL which sources the amplitude and scale-dependence of the mode
coupling but rather a combination of 'response functions'. We discuss why it is
difficult to construct successful scenarios and enumerate the fine-tunings
which seem to be required. Finally, we exhibit a concrete model which can be
contrived to match the observational constraints and show that to a Planck-like
experiment it would appear to have |fNL-local| ~ |fNL-equi| ~ |fNL-ortho| ~ 1.
Therefore, contrary to previous analyses, we conclude that it is possible to
generate the asymmetry while respecting observational constraints on the
bispectrum and low-ell multipoles even without tuning our location on the
long-wavelength mode.

reproduce the details of the LOSVD. Models with a dark halo recover the
kinematics well and indicate that NGC 1281 is dark matter dominated, making up
~ 90 per cent of the total enclosed mass within the kinematic bounds.
Parameterised as a spherical NFW profile, the dark halo mass is 11.5 <
log(M_{DM}/M_{sun}) < 11.8 and the stellar M/L is 0.6 < {\Upsilon} < 1.1.
However, this stellar M/L is lower than predicted by its old stellar
population. Moreover, the halo mass within the kinematic extent is ten times
larger than expected based on {\Lambda}CDM predictions, and an extrapolation
yields cluster sized dark halo masses. Adopting {\Upsilon} = 1.7
{\Upsilon}_{sun} yields more moderate dark halo virial masses, but these models
fit the kinematics worse. A non-NFW model might solve the discrepancy between
the unphysical consequences of the best-fitting dynamical models and models
based on more reasonable assumptions for the dark halo and stellar
mass-to-light ratio, which are disfavoured according to our parameter
estimation.

using the infrared spectral slope or bolometric temperature, but either can
result in contamination of samples. More accurate methods to determine the
evolutionary stage of YSOs will improve the reliability of statistics for the
embedded YSO population and provide more robust stage lifetimes. Aims. We aim
to separate the truly embedded YSOs from more evolved sources. Methods. Maps of
HCO+ J=4-3 and C18O J=3-2 were observed with HARP on the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope (JCMT) for a sample of 56 candidate YSOs in Perseus and Taurus in
order to characterize emission from high (column) density gas. These are
supplemented with archival dust continuum maps observed with SCUBA on the JCMT
and Herschel PACS to compare the morphology of the gas and dust in the
protostellar envelopes. The spatial concentration of HCO+ J=4-3 and 850 micron
dust emission are used to classify the embedded nature of YSOs. Results.
Approximately 30% of Class 0+I sources in Perseus and Taurus are not Stage I,
but are likely to be more evolved Stage II pre-main sequence (PMS) stars with
disks. An additional 16% are confused sources with an uncertain evolutionary
stage. Conclusions. Separating classifications by cloud reveals that a high
percentage of the Class 0+I sources in the Perseus star forming region are
truly embedded Stage I sources (71%), while the Taurus cloud hosts a majority
of evolved PMS stars with disks (68%). The concentration factor method is
useful to correct misidentified embedded YSOs, yielding higher accuracy for YSO
population statistics and Stage timescales. Current estimates (0.54 Myr) may
overpredict the Stage I lifetime on the order of 30%, resulting in timescales
of 0.38 Myr for the embedded phase.

better than the widely used hMetis hypergraph partitioner that uses a classical

initial partitioning and adaptive budgeting of imbalance within recursive
bipartitioning, we achieve very high quality. We assembled a large benchmark
set with 310 hypergraphs stemming from application areas such VLSI, SAT

interstellar medium (wim) in early-type galaxies (ETGs) hold key observational
constraints to nuclear activity and the buildup history of these massive
quiescent systems. High-quality integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data with a
wide spectral and spatial coverage, such as those from the CALIFA survey, offer
a precious opportunity for advancing our understanding in this respect. We use
deep IFS data from CALIFA (califa.caha.es) to study the wim over the entire
extent and optical spectral range of 32 nearby ETGs. We find that all ETGs in
our sample show faint (H\alpha\ equivalent width EW~0.5...2 {\AA}) extranuclear
nebular emission extending out to >= 2 Petrosian_50 radii. Confirming and
strengthening our conclusions in Papaderos et al. (2013) we argue that ETGs
span a broad continuous sequence with regard to the properties of their wim,
and they can be roughly subdivided into two characteristic classes. The first
one (type i) comprises ETGs with a nearly constant EW~1-3 {\AA} in their
extranuclear component, in quantitative agreement with (even though, no proof
for) the hypothesis of photoionization by pAGB stars. The second class (type
ii) consists of virtually wim-evacuated ETGs with a large Lyman continuum (Lyc)
photon escape fraction and a very low (<= 0.5 {\AA}) EW in their nuclear zone.
These two classes appear indistinguishable from one another by their
LINER-specific emission-line ratios. Additionally, here we extend the
classification by the class i+ which stands for a subset of type i ETGs with
low-level star-fomation in contiguous spiral-arm like features in their
outermost periphery. These faint features, together with traces of localized
star formation in several type i&i+ systems point to a non-negligible
contribution from young massive stars to the global ionizing photon budget in
ETGs.

the partition function of a fixed structure, each having nearly the same mutual

possibility of the existence of relevant patterns embedded in the sequences

Local Operations assisted by Classical Communication (LOCC). The Maximally
Entangled Set (MES) of states is the minimal set of n-partite pure states with
the property that any truly n-partite entangled pure state can be obtained
deterministically via LOCC from some state in this set. Hence, this set
contains the most useful states for applications. In this work we characterize
the MES for generic three qutrit states. Moreover, we analyze which generic
three qutrit states are reachable (and convertible) under LOCC transformations.
To this end we study reachability via separable operations (SEP), a class of
operations that is strictly larger than LOCC. Interestingly, we identify a
family of pure states that can be obtained deterministically via SEP but not
via LOCC. To our knowledge these are the first examples of transformations
among pure states that can be implemented via SEP but not via LOCC.

with external magnetic field, and another still remains undetermined. The
equations give a possibility to describe the motion of both massive and
massless particles with spin. All solutions of the equations of motion in the
absence of external fields were found, and besides, we give more precise
definition of a free object. It turns out that the massive particles always
possess a longitudinal polarization. There are possible transversal motions of
the following types: 1) oscillatory motion with proper frequency, 2) circular
motion, and 3) complicated motion along rosette trajectories round the center
of inertia with the velocity, varying in finite limits. Free massless particles
can either fluctuate or move along complicated paths around fixed centers of
balance, when the spin of the particles can have any direction.

mobile sensor may change its position rapidly and thus require localization
calls frequently. A localization may require network wide information and
increase traffic over the network. It dissipates valuable energy for message
communication. Thus localization is very costly. The control of the number of
localization calls may save energy consumption, as it is rather expensive. To
reduce the frequency of localization calls for a mobile sensor, we propose a
technique that involves \textit{Mobility Aware Interpolation} (MAINT) for
position estimation. It controls the number of localizations which gives much
better result than the existing localization control schemes using mobility
aware extrapolation. The proposed method involves very low arithmetic
computation overheads. We find analytical expressions for the expected error in
position estimation. A parameter, the time interval, has been introduced to
externally control the energy dissipation. Simulation studies are carried out
to compare the performances of the proposed method with some existing
localization control schemes as well as the theoretical results. The simulation
results shows that the expected error at any point of time may be computed from
this expression. We have seen that constant error limit can be maintained
increasing the time period of localization proportional to rate of change of
direction of its motion. Increasing time period, the energy may be saved with a
stable error limit.

The limit is described by the tropical morphism; a piecewise linear map with

is spatially homogeneous and isotropic. When interpreting most observations,
this cosmological principle is applied stricto sensu: the light emitted by
distant sources is assumed to propagate through a Friedmann-Lema\^itre
spacetime. The main goal of the present thesis was to evaluate how reliable
this assumption is, especially when small scales are at stake. After having
reviewed the laws of geometric optics in curved spacetime, and the standard
interpretation of cosmological observables, the dissertation reports a
comprehensive analysis of light propagation in Swiss-cheese models, designed to
capture the clumpy character of the Universe. The resulting impact on the
interpretation of the Hubble diagram is quantified, and shown to be relatively
small, thanks to the cosmological constant. When applied to current supernova
data, the associated corrections tend however to improve the agreement between
the cosmological parameters inferred from the Hubble diagram and from the
cosmic microwave background. This is a hint that the effect of small-scale
structures on light propagation may become non-negligible in the era of
precision cosmology. This motivated the development of a new theoretical
framework, based on stochastic processes, which aims at describing small-scale
gravitational lensing with a better accuracy. Regarding the isotropy side of
the cosmological principle, this dissertation addresses, on the one hand, the
potential effect of a large-scale anisotropy on light propagation, by solving
all the equations of geometric optics in the Bianchi I spacetime. On the other
hand, possible sources of such an anisotropy, namely scalar-vector models for
inflation or dark energy, are analysed. Most of them turn out to be excluded as
physically viable theories.

Cassini spacecraft images of Jupiter and Saturn. We fit analytical functions to
the local reflected brightnesses of Jupiter and Saturn depending on the
planet's phase. These observations cover broad bands at 0.59-0.72 and 0.39-0.5
{\mu}m, and narrow bands at 0.938 (atmospheric window), 0.889 (CH4 absorption
band), and 0.24-0.28 {\mu}m. We simulate the images of the planets with a
ray-tracing model, and disk-integrate them to produce the full-orbit light
curves. For Jupiter, we also fit the modeled light curves to the observed
full-disk brightness. We derive spherical albedos for Jupiter, Saturn, and for
planets with Lambertian and Rayleigh-scattering atmospheres. Jupiter-like
atmospheres can produce light curves that are a factor of two fainter at
half-phase than the Lambertian planet, given the same geometric albedo at
transit. The spherical albedo is typically lower than for a Lambertian planet
by up to a factor of 1.5. The Lambertian assumption will underestimate the
absorption of the stellar light and the equilibrium temperature of the
planetary atmosphere. We also compare our light curves with the light curves of
solid bodies: the moons Enceladus and Callisto. Their strong backscattering
peak within a few degrees of opposition (secondary eclipse) can lead to an even
stronger underestimate of the stellar heating.
