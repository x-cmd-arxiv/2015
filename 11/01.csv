data.Predictive models may systematically discriminate groups of people even if
the computing process is fair and well-intentioned. Discrimination-aware data
mining studies how to make predictive models free from discrimination, when
historical data, on which they are built, may be biased, incomplete, or even
contain past discriminatory decisions. Discrimination refers to disadvantageous
treatment of a person based on belonging to a category rather than on
individual merit. In this survey we review and organize various discrimination
measures that have been used for measuring discrimination in data, as well as
in evaluating performance of discrimination-aware predictive models. We also
discuss related measures from other disciplines, which have not been used for
measuring discrimination, but potentially could be suitable for this purpose.
We computationally analyze properties of selected measures. We also review and
discuss measuring procedures, and present recommendations for practitioners.
The primary target audience is data mining, machine learning, pattern
recognition, statistical modeling researchers developing new methods for
non-discriminatory predictive modeling. In addition, practitioners and policy
makers would use the survey for diagnosing potential discrimination by
predictive models.

using mid-infrared pulses. This involves selectively exciting the highest
frequency $A_1$ phonon mode of a ferroelectric material with an intense
mid-infrared pulse. Large amplitude oscillations of this mode provides a
unidirectional force to the lattice such that it displaces along the lowest
frequency $A_1$ phonon mode coordinate because of a nonlinear coupling of the
type $g Q_{\textrm{P}} Q_{\textrm{IR}}^2$ between the two modes. First
principles calculations show that this coupling is large in transition-metal
oxide ferroelectrics, and the sign of the coupling is such that the lattice
displaces in the switching direction. Furthermore, I find that the lowest
frequency $A_1$ mode has a large $Q_{\textrm{P}}^3$ order anharmonicity, which
causes a discontinuous switch of electric polarization as the pump amplitude is
continuously increased.

classifying authorized devices based on the unique Radio Frequency Fingerprints
(RFFs) extracted from their radio frequency signals at the physical layer.
Current works of WPLI focus on demonstrating system feasibility based on
experimental error performance of WPLI with a fixed number of users. While an
important question remains to be answered: what's the user number that WPLI can
accommodate using different RFFs and receiving equipment. The user capacity of
the WPLI can be a major concern for practical system designers and can also be
a key metric to evaluate the classification performance of WPLI. In this work,
we establish a theoretical understanding on user capacity of WPLI in an
information-theoretic perspective. We apply information-theoretic modeling on
RFF features of WPLI. An information-theoretic approach is consequently
proposed based on mutual information between RFF and user identity to
characterize the user capacity of WPLI. Based on this theoretical tool, the
achievable user capacity of WPLI is characterized under practical constrains of
off-the-shelf receiving devices. Field experiments on classification error
performance are conducted for the validation of the information-theoretic user
capacity characterization.

machines or kernel based regression has been proved to be consistent for
certain classes of discrete dynamical systems. Consistency implies that these
methods are effective at computing the expected value of a point at a future
time given the present coordinates. However, the present coordinates themselves
are noisy, and therefore, these methods are not necessarily effective at
removing noise. In this article, we consider denoising and prediction as
separate problems for flows, as opposed to discrete time dynamical systems, and
show that the use of smooth splines is more effective at removing noise.
Combination of smooth splines and kernel based regression yields predictors
that are more accurate on benchmarks typically by a factor of 2 or more. We
prove that kernel based regression in combination with smooth splines converges
to the exact predictor for time series extracted from any compact invariant set
of any sufficiently smooth flow. As a consequence of convergence, one can find
examples where the combination of kernel based regression with smooth splines
is superior by even a factor of $100$. The predictors that we compute operate
on delay coordinate data and not the full state vector, which is typically not
observable.

introduce the so-called micro-walking machine. This model consists of a rigid
body with a number of elastic contact spots that is pulled by a constantly
moving base. The system slides with dry friction on a rigid substrate. The
kinematic coupling of the rotation and the translation of the rigid body
results in varying normal and tangential forces at the contact spots. For
certain parameter ranges this leads to self-excited oscillations in the
vertical direction. A particular dynamic mode occurs which is characterized by
a strong correlation between low or even zero normal forces and a fast forward
motion. This effect is referred to as micro-walking. In addition to an
experimental rig we use numerical integration and an extensive parameter study
for the analysis. In theory, the reduction of the frictional resistance reaches
up to 98%. These results are confirmed by the experiments where the maximal
reduction was 73%. Our model shows that micro-vibrations play an important role
for the dynamic influences on the frictional resistance of systems that exhibit
apparently smooth sliding. The identification of the critical parameter range
enables the systematic control of frictional resistance through the adjustment
of attributes such as geometry and stiffness. In addition, it is possible to
deduce guidelines for how tribological test rigs should be designed in order to
get reliable results.

nm, corresponding to a 360{\deg} DW packing density of 4 DWs per micron.
Understanding the topological properties of the 360{\deg} DWs allows us to
understand their formation and annihilation in the proposed geometry. Adjacent
360{\deg} DWs have opposite circulation, and closer spacing result in the
adjacent walls breaking into 180{\deg} DWs and annihilating.

sites. The noise may have two kinds of effects: loss of atoms from the trap,
and random shifts in the relative phase or number difference between the two
wells. The effects of phase noise are mitigated by atom-atom interactions and
tunneling, such that the dephasing rate may be reduced to half its single-atom
value. Decoherence due to number noise (which induces fluctuations in the
relative atom number between the wells) is considerably enhanced by the
interactions. A similar scenario is predicted for the case of atom loss, even
if the loss rates from the two sites are equal. In fact, interactions convert
the increased uncertainty in atom number (difference) into (relative) phase
diffusion and reduce the coherence across the junction. We examine the

that achieves high bandwidth between GPU servers -- Infiniband or Cray

than the traditional parameter server approach. Third, we optionally increase
the batch size to reduce the total quantity of communication during DNN

games. Incentive equilibria generalise well-studied solution concepts such as
Nash equilibria and leader equilibria (also known as Stackelberg equilibria).
Recall that a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can improve
his payoff by changing his strategy unilaterally. In the setting of incentive
and leader equilibria, there is a distinguished player called the leader who
can assign strategies to all other players, referred to as her followers. A
strategy profile is a leader strategy profile if no player, except for the
leader, can improve his payoff by changing his strategy unilaterally, and a
leader equilibrium is a leader strategy profile with a maximal return for the
leader. In the proposed case of incentive equilibria, the leader can
additionally influence the behaviour of her followers by transferring parts of
her payoff to her followers. The ability to incentivise her followers provides
the leader with more freedom in selecting strategy profiles, and we show that
this can indeed improve the payoff for the leader in such games. The key
fundamental result of the paper is the existence of incentive equilibria in
mean-payoff games. We further show that the decision problem related to
constructing incentive equilibria is NP-complete. On a positive note, we show
that, when the number of players is fixed, the complexity of the problem falls
in the same class as two-player mean-payoff games. We also present an
implementation of the proposed algorithms, and discuss experimental results

a landing vehicle and an autonomous and/or teleoperated rover. Artificial
intelligence and machine learning techniques can be leveraged for better

navigation and metaheuristic optimization algorithms to plan the safe,
efficient missions. The aim is to determine the least-cost combination of a
safe landing zone (LZ) and global path plan, where avoiding terrain hazards for
the lander and rover minimizes cost. Computer vision methods were used to
identify surface craters, mounds, and rocks as obstacles. Multiple search
methods were investigated for the rover global path plan. Several combinatorial
optimization algorithms were implemented to select the shortest distance path
as the preferred mission plan. Simulations were run for a sample Google Lunar X
Prize mission. The result of this study is an optimization scheme that path
plans with the A* search method, and uses simulated annealing to select ideal
LZ-path- goal combination for the mission. Simulation results show the methods
are effective in minimizing the risk of hazards and increasing efficiency. This
paper is specific to a lunar mission, but the resulting architecture may be
applied to a large variety of planetary missions and rovers.

consumption, and price to be implemented in all user terminals. Therefore,
techniques to exploit in-band full-duplex communication with FD base stations
(BSs) and half-duplex (HD) users' equipment (UEs) are required. In this
context, 3-node topology (3NT) has been recently proposed for FD BSs to reuse
the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) channels with HD terminals within the same
cell. In this paper, we present a tractable mathematical framework, based on
stochastic geometry, for 3NT in cellular networks. To this end, we propose a
design paradigm via pulse-shaping and partial overlap between UL and DL
channels to maximize the harvested rate gains in 3NT. The results show that 3NT
achieves a close performance to networks with FD BSs and FD UEs, denoted by
2-node topology (2NT) networks. A maximum of 5$\%$ rate loss is reported when
3NT is compared to 2NT with efficient self-interference cancellation (SIC). If
the SIC in 2NT is not efficient, 3NT highly outperforms 2NT. Consequently, we
conclude that, irrespective to the UE duplexing scheme, it is sufficient to
have FD BSs to harvest FD rate gains.

zirconium. By defining the crystal lattice point, at which more than one atom
fall in the Wigner-Seitz cell of the lattice point, for the location of
interstitial atoms (LSIA), three types of events were identified for LSIA
migration: the jump remaining in one <112_0> direction (ILJ), the jump from one
<112_0> to another <112_0> direction in the same basal plane (OLJ) and the jump
from one basal plane to an adjacent basal plane (OPJ). The occurrence
frequencies of the three types were calculated. ILJ was found to be the
dominant event in the temperature range (300K to 1200K), but the occurrence
frequencies of OLJ and OPJ increased with increasing temperature. Although the
three types of jumps may not follow Brownian and Arrhenius behavior, on the
whole, the migration of the LSIAs tend to be Brownian-like. Moreover, the
migration trajectories of LSAs in the hcp basal-plane are not what are observed
if only conventional one- or two-dimensional migrations exist; rather, they
exhibit the feature we call fraction-dimensional. Namely, the trajectories are
composed of line segments in <112_0> directions with the average length of the
line segments varying with the temperature. Using MC simulations, the potential
kinetic impacts of the fraction-dimensional migration, measured by the average
number of lattice sites visited per jump event n_SPE was analyzed. The
significant differences between the n_SPE value of the fraction-dimensional
migration and those of the conventional one- and two-dimensional migrations
suggest that the conventional diffusion coefficient, which cannot reflect the
feature of fraction-dimensional migration, cannot give an accurate description
of the underlying kinetics of SIAs in Zr.

${}^{40}$Ca + ${}^{238}$U and ${}^{48}$Ca + ${}^{238}$U systems near the
quasi-fission regime in the framework of the Stochastic Mean-Field (SMF)
approach. Sufficiently below the fusion barrier, di-nuclear structure in the
collisions is maintained to a large extend. Consequently, it is possible to
describe nucleon exchange as a diffusion process familiar from deep-inelastic
collisions. Diffusion coefficients for proton and neutron exchange are
determined from the microscopic basis of the SMF approach in the semi-classical
framework. Calculations show that after a fast charge equilibration the system
drifts toward symmetry over a very long interaction time. Large dispersions of
proton and neutron distributions of the produced fragments indicate that
diffusion mechanism may help to populate heavy trans-uranium elements near the
quasi-fission regime in these collisions.

that within the constraints of this model, the square of the signal-to-noise
ratio is always proportional to the ""volume"" of the spatial resolution unit. In
the case of Poisson statistics, the ratio of these two quantities divided by
the incident density of the imaging particles (e.g. photons) represents a
dimensionless invariant of the imaging system, which was previously termed the
intrinsic imaging quality. The relationship of this invariant to the notion of

applied to a simple generic model of quantitative imaging of weakly scattering

considered to be the method of choice for continuous optimization when first-
and/or second- order information is available. However, the use of L-BFGS can
be complicated in a black-box scenario where gradient information is not
available and therefore should be numerically estimated. The accuracy of this
estimation, obtained by finite difference methods, is often problem-dependent
that may lead to premature convergence of the algorithm.
  In this paper, we demonstrate an alternative to L-BFGS, the limited memory
Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (LM-CMA) proposed by Loshchilov
(2014). The LM-CMA is a stochastic derivative-free algorithm for numerical
optimization of non-linear, non-convex optimization problems. Inspired by the
L-BFGS, the LM-CMA samples candidate solutions according to a covariance matrix
reproduced from $m$ direction vectors selected during the optimization process.
The decomposition of the covariance matrix into Cholesky factors allows to
reduce the memory complexity to $O(mn)$, where $n$ is the number of decision
variables. The time complexity of sampling one candidate solution is also
$O(mn)$, but scales as only about 25 scalar-vector multiplications in practice.
The algorithm has an important property of invariance w.r.t. strictly
increasing transformations of the objective function, such transformations do
not compromise its ability to approach the optimum. The LM-CMA outperforms the
original CMA-ES and its large scale versions on non-separable ill-conditioned
problems with a factor increasing with problem dimension. Invariance properties
of the algorithm do not prevent it from demonstrating a comparable performance
to L-BFGS on non-trivial large scale smooth and nonsmooth optimization
problems.

related to fact that in some situations the operator responsible for reduction
of the non-adjacent case to the adjacent one is not injective. The operator is
trivially injective when 0<\beta_1<1. We show that when \beta_1>=1 the operator
is injective when s = 2, 3, 4. Therefore in these cases the method proposed by
Lopez-Blazquez is valid. We also show that the operator is not injective when

macroscopic oscillations emerge in solely excitatory random networks and
without topological constraints. We experimentally and theoretically show that
these oscillations stem from the counterintuitive underlying mechanism - the
intrinsic stochastic neuronal response failures. These neuronal response
failures, which are characterized by short-term memory, lead to cooperation
among neurons, resulting in sub- or several- Hertz macroscopic oscillations
which coexist with high frequency gamma oscillations. A quantitative interplay
between the statistical network properties and the emerging oscillations is
supported by simulations of large networks based on single-neuron in-vitro
experiments and a Langevin equation describing the network dynamics. Results
call for the examination of these oscillations in the presence of inhibition

Furthermore, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic

Several control laws are introduced for the consensus problem. By a simple
transformation, it is shown that the proposed control laws can be used for the
formation problem. The design is first conducted on the kinematic level, where
the velocities are the control laws. Then, for rigid bodies in space, the
design is conducted on the dynamic level, where the torques and the forces are
the control laws. On the kinematic level, first two control laws are introduced
that explicitly use Euclidean transformations, then separate control laws are
defined for the rotations and the translations. In the special case of purely
rotational motion, the consensus problem is referred to as consensus on SO(3)
or attitude synchronization. In this problem, for a broad class of local
representations or parameterizations of SO(3), including the Axis-Angle
Representation, the Rodrigues Parameters and the Modified Rodrigues Parameters,
two types of control laws are presented that look structurally the same for any
choice of local representation. For these two control laws we provide
conditions on the initial rotations and the connectivity of the graph such that
the system reaches consensus on SO(3). Among the contributions of this paper,
there are conditions for when exponential rate of convergence occur. A theorem
is provided showing that for any choice of local representation for the
rotations, there is a change of coordinates such that the transformed system
has a well known structure.

by Bardow et~al.(2006), and the discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) are
two methods that successfully overcome the time step restriction by the
collision time, which is commonly seen in many other kinetic schemes.
Basically, the BKG scheme is a time splitting scheme, while the DUGKS is an
un-split finite volume scheme. In this work, we first perform a theoretical
analysis of the two schemes in the finite volume framework by comparing their
numerical flux evaluations. It is found that the effects of collision term are
considered in the reconstructions of the cell-interface distribution function
in both schemes, which explains why they can overcome the time step restriction
and can give accurate results even as the time step is much larger than the
collision time. The difference between the two schemes lies in the treatment of
the integral of the collision term, in which the Bardow's scheme uses the
rectangular rule while the DUGKS uses the trapezoidal rule. The performance of
the two schemes, i.e., accuracy, stability, and efficiency are then compared by
simulating several two dimensional flows, including the unsteady Taylor-Green
vortex flow, the steady lid-driven cavity flow, and the laminar boundary layer
problem. It is observed that, the DUGKS can give more accurate results than the
BKG scheme. Furthermore, the numerical stability of the BKG scheme decreases as
the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number approaches to 1, while the stability
of DUGKS is not affected by the CFL number apparently as long as CFL<1. It is
also observed that the BKG scheme is about one time faster than the DUGKS
scheme with the same computational mesh and time step.

that |I_b|=|I_r|, and imagine that a token is placed on each vertex in |I_b|.
Then, the sliding token problem is to determine whether there exists a sequence
of independent sets which transforms I_b into I_r so that each independent set
in the sequence results from the previous one by sliding exactly one token
along an edge in the graph. The sliding token problem is one of the
reconfiguration problems that attract the attention from the viewpoint of
theoretical computer science. The reconfiguration problems tend to be
PSPACE-complete in general, and some polynomial time algorithms are shown in
restricted cases. Recently, the problems that aim at finding a shortest
reconfiguration sequence are investigated. For the 3SAT problem, a trichotomy
for the complexity of finding the shortest sequence has been shown, that is, it
is in P, NP-complete, or PSPACE-complete in certain conditions. In general,
even if it is polynomial time solvable to decide whether two instances are
reconfigured with each other, it can be NP-complete to find a shortest sequence
between them. Namely, finding a shortest sequence between two independent sets
can be more difficult than the decision problem of reconfigurability between
them. In this paper, we show that the problem for finding a shortest sequence
between two independent sets is polynomial time solvable for some graph classes
which are subclasses of the class of interval graphs. More precisely, we can
find a shortest sequence between two independent sets on a graph G in
polynomial time if either G is a proper interval graph, a trivially perfect
graph, or a caterpillar. As far as the authors know, this is the first
polynomial time algorithm for the shortest sliding token problem for a graph

crucial impact on the spectral formation. Although rapid cooling of the ejecta
to a few 100 K occurs also in these models, the late-time optical/NIR flux is
brighter by 1-2 magnitudes due to redistribution of UV emissivity, resulting
from non-thermal excitation and ionization. This effect brings models into
better agreement with late-time observations of SN 2011fe and other Type Ia
supernovae, and offers a solution to the long standing discrepancy between
models and observations. The models show that spectral formation shifts from Fe
II and Fe III at 300d to Fe I at 1000d, which explains the apparent wavelength
shifts seen in SN2011fe. We discuss effects of time dependence and energy input

Standard Model. Differences between the absorption spectra of H$_2$ as observed
at high redshift and those measured in the laboratory can be interpreted in
terms of possible variations of the proton-electron mass ratio. Investigation
of some ten of such absorbers in the redshift range $z= 2.0-4.2$ yields a
constraint of $|\Delta\mu/\mu|< 5 \times 10^{-6}$ at 3$\sigma$. Observation of
H$_2$ from the photospheres of white dwarf stars inside our Galaxy delivers a
constraint of similar magnitude on a dependence of $\mu$ on a gravitational
potential $10^4$ times as strong as on the Earth's surface. Laser-based
precision measurements of dissociation energies, vibrational splittings and
rotational level energies in H$_2$ molecules and their deuterated isotopomers
HD and D$_2$ produce values for the rovibrational binding energies fully
consistent with quantum ab initio calculations including relativistic and
quantum electrodynamical (QED) effects. Similarly, precision measurements of
high-overtone vibrational transitions of HD$^+$ ions, captured in ion traps and
sympathetically cooled to mK temperatures, also result in transition
frequencies fully consistent with calculations including QED corrections.
Precision measurements of inter-Rydberg transitions in H$_2$ can be
extrapolated to yield accurate values for level splittings in the H$_2^+$-ion.
These comprehensive results of laboratory precision measurements on neutral and
ionic hydrogen molecules can be interpreted to set bounds on the existence of
possible fifth forces and of higher dimensions, phenomena describing physics
beyond the Standard Model.

order formalism. In this formalism, the derivation of the entropy of a black
hole on bifurcation surface, as a quasi-local conserved charge is problematic.
In this paper we overcome to these problems by considering the concept of total
variation and the Lorentz-Lie derivative. We firstly find an expression for the
ADT conserved current in the context of the CSLTG which is based on the concept
of the Killing vector fields. Then, we generalize it to be conserved for all
diffeomorphism generators. Thus, we can extract an off-shell conserved charge
for any vector field which generates a diffeomorphism. The formalism presented
here is based on the concept of quasi-local conserved charges which are
off-shell. The charges can be calculated on any codimension two space-like
surface surrounding a black hole and the results are independent of the chosen
surface. By using the off-shell quasi-local conserved charge, we investigate
the Virasoro algebra and find a formula to calculate the central extension
term. We apply the formalism to the BTZ black hole solution in the context of
the Einstein gravity and the Generalized massive gravity, then we find the
eigenvalues of their Virasoro generators as well as the corresponding central
charges. Eventually, we calculate the entropy of the BTZ black hole by the
Cardy formula and we show that the result exactly matches with the one obtained
by the concept of the off-shell conserved charges.
