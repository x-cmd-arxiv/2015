dynamics that has recently been shown to include topologically protected bound
states (zero-modes) at boundaries or domain walls. Here we show that a
topological zero-mode may acquire a dynamical role in the presence of
nonlinearities. We consider a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk that
combines zero-modes with a particle-conserving nonlinear relaxation mechanism.
The presence of both particle-hole and chiral symmetry converts two zero-modes
of opposite chirality into an attractor-repeller pair of the nonlinear
dynamics. This makes it possible to steer the walker towards a domain wall and
trap it there.

these approaches by implementing two different strategies: L1 logistic
regression (L1LR) that models a single global solution and classification trees
that model multiple local solutions corresponding to discriminant subregions of
the feature space. For each strategy, we built a standard model, and a sparser
version of it. As an alternative to pruning, we explore a promising approach
that first constrains the tree model with an L1LR-based feature selection, an
approach we called L1LR-Tree. The objective is to decrease its vulnerability to
small data variations by removing variables corresponding to unstable local
phenomena. Our study is twofold: i) from a methodological perspective comparing
the performances and the stability of the three previous methods, i.e L1LR,
classification trees and L1LR-Tree, for the classification of severe forms of
imported malaria, and ii) from an applied perspective improving the actual
classification of severe forms of imported malaria by identifying more
personalized profiles predictive of several clinical criteria based on
variables dismissed for the clinical definition of the disease. The main
methodological results show that the combined method L1LR-Tree builds sparse

since the solver has to reason about the tree structures rather than the linear
ones as in a linear solver. In this paper we propose an incremental approach to
solving a set of non-linear Horn clauses using a linear Horn clause solver. We
achieve this by interleaving a program transformation and a linear solver. The
program transformation is based on the notion of tree dimension, which we apply
to trees corresponding to Horn clause derivations. The dimension of a tree is a
measure of its non-linearity -- for example a linear tree (whose nodes have at
most one child) has dimension zero while a complete binary tree has dimension
equal to its height.
  A given set of Horn clauses $P$ can be transformed into a new set of clauses
$P^k$ (whose derivation trees are the subset of $P$'s derivation trees with
dimension at most $k$). We start by generating $P^k$ with $k=0$, which is
linear by definition, then pass it to a linear solver. If $P^k$ has a solution
$M$, and is a solution to $P$ then $P$ has a solution $M$. If $M$ is not a
solution of $P$, we plugged $M$ to $P^{(k+1)}$ which again becomes linear and
pass it to the solver and continue successively for increasing value of $k$
until we find a solution to $P$ or resources are exhausted. Experiment on some
Horn clause verification benchmarks indicates that this is a promising approach
for solving a set of non-linear Horn clauses using a linear solver. It
indicates that many times a solution obtained for some under-approximation
$P^k$ of $P$ becomes a solution for $P$ for a fairly small value of $k$.

data and edge-on orientation enable us for the first time to include the halo

correlations of $L_{\rm radio}$ with the mid-IR-based SFR. The normalization of
our $I_{\rm 1.6GHz}/{\rm W~Hz^{-1}}-{\rm SFR}$ relation is $\sim$2-3 times of
those obtained for face-on galaxies, probably a result of enhanced IR
extinction at high inclination. We also find tight correlations between $L_{\rm

the energy loss via synchrotron radio continuum accounts for $\sim0.1\%$ of
$\dot{E}_{\rm SN}$, comparable to the energy contained in CR electrons. The
integrated C-to-L-band spectral index is $\alpha\sim0.5-1.1$ for non-AGN
galaxies, indicating a dominance by the diffuse synchrotron component. The
low-scatter $L_{\rm radio}-{\rm SFR}$/$L_{\rm radio}-\dot{E}_{\rm SN (Ia+CC)}$
relationships have super-linear logarithmic slopes at $\sim2~\sigma$ in L-band

($1.057\pm0.075$/$1.100\pm0.123$). The super-linearity could be naturally
reproduced with non-calorimeter models for galaxy disks. Using Chandra halo
X-ray measurements, we find sub-linear $L_{\rm X}-L_{\rm radio}$ relations.
These results indicate that the observed radio halo of a starburst galaxy is
close to electron calorimeter, and a galaxy with higher SFR tends to distribute
an increased fraction of SNe energy into radio emission (than X-ray).

heart of human intelligence. As automatic visual category recognition in images
is approaching human performance, the high level understanding in the dynamic
spatiotemporal domain of videos and its translation into natural language is
still far from being solved. While most works on vision-to-text translations
use pre-learned or pre-established computational linguistic models, in this
paper we present an approach that uses vision alone to efficiently learn how to
translate into language the video content. We discover, in simple form, the
story played by main actors, while using only visual cues for representing
objects and their interactions. Our method learns in a hierarchical manner
higher level representations for recognizing subjects, actions and objects
involved, their relevant contextual background and their interaction to one
another over time. We have a three stage approach: first we take in
consideration features of the individual entities at the local level of
appearance, then we consider the relationship between these objects and actions
and their video background, and third, we consider their spatiotemporal
relations as inputs to classifiers at the highest level of interpretation.
Thus, our approach finds a coherent linguistic description of videos in the
form of a subject, verb and object based on their role played in the overall
visual story learned directly from training data, without using a known
language model. We test the efficiency of our approach on a large scale dataset

applications have been in the area of video classification and detection, i.e.,
problems involving the prediction of a single class label or a handful of
output variables per video. Furthermore, while deep networks are commonly
recognized as the best models to use in these domains, there is a widespread
perception that in order to yield successful results they often require
time-consuming architecture search, manual tweaking of parameters and
computationally intensive pre-processing or post-processing methods.
  In this paper we challenge these views by presenting a deep 3D convolutional

output a variable at every voxel of the video. Most importantly, we show that
the same exact architecture can be used to achieve competitive results on three
widely different voxel-prediction tasks: video semantic segmentation, optical
flow estimation, and video coloring. The three networks learned on these

Thus, they offer an efficient alternative to traditional and much more

as CO, are important coolants in the gas phase. Depletion of these molecules on
dust surfaces affects the thermal balance of molecular clouds and with that
their whole evolution. For the first time, we study the effect of grain surface
chemistry (GSC) on star formation and its impact on the initial mass function
(IMF). We follow a contracting translucent cloud in which we treat the
gas-grain chemical interplay in detail, including the process of freeze-out. We
perform 3d hydrodynamical simulations under three different conditions, a pure
gas-phase model, a freeze-out model, and a complete chemistry model. The models
display different thermal evolution during cloud collapse. The equation of
state (EOS) of the gas becomes softer with CO freeze-out and the results show
that at the onset of star formation, the cloud retains its evolution history
such that the number of formed stars differ (by 7%) between the three models.
While the stellar mass distribution results in a different IMF when we consider
pure freeze-out, with the complete treatment of the GSC, the divergence from a
pure gas-phase model is minimal. We find that the impact of freeze-out is
balanced by the non-thermal processes; chemical and photodesorption. We also
find an average filament width of 0.12 pc ($\pm$0.03 pc), and speculate that
this may be a result from the changes in the EOS caused by the gas-dust thermal
coupling. We conclude that GSC plays a big role in the chemical composition of
molecular clouds and that surface processes are needed to accurately interpret
observations, however, that GSC does not have a significant impact as far as
star formation and the IMF is concerned.

classification/retrieval systems based on the bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) model.
Dictionaries are usually learned without supervision from a training set of
images sampled from the collection of interest. However, for large,
general-purpose, dynamic image collections (e.g., the Web), obtaining a
representative sample in terms of semantic concepts is not straightforward. In
this paper, we evaluate the impact of semantics in the dictionary quality,
aiming at verifying the importance of semantic diversity in relation visual
diversity for visual dictionaries. In the experiments, we vary the amount of
classes used for creating the dictionary and then compute different BoVW
descriptors, using multiple codebook sizes and different coding and pooling
methods (standard BoVW and Fisher Vectors). Results for image classification
show that as visual dictionaries are based on low-level visual appearances,
visual diversity is more important than semantic diversity. Our conclusions
open the opportunity to alleviate the burden in generating visual dictionaries

gradients or inhomogeneities as expected if the ongoing star-formation activity
is sustained by the infall/accretion of metal-poor gas. No evidences of
significant spatial variations of abundances were found within our
uncertainties. However, our findings show a slight anticorrelation between gas
metallicity and star-formation rate at spaxel scales, in the sense that high
star-formation is found in regions of low-metallicity, but the scatter in this
relation indicates that the metals are almost fully diluted. Our observations
show the presence of extended H$\alpha$ emission in the stellar tail of the
galaxy. We estimated that the mass of the ionized gas in the tail
M(HII)$_{tail} \sim$1.7$\times$10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$ corresponds with $\sim$ 24
per cent of the total mass of the ionized gas in the galaxy. We found that the
H$\alpha$ velocity dispersion of the main body and the tail of the galaxy are
comparable with the one found in the neutral gas by previous studies. This
suggests that the ionized gas still retains the kinematic memory of its
parental cloud and likely a common origin. Finally, we suggest that the

Lorentzian lineshape and gpar=2.0043(3), gper=2.0030(3), which was previously
assigned in the literature to the N donors in the 1s(E) excited state. Based on
the analysis of the ESR lineshape, linewidth and g-tensor we attribute this

T>80 K was explained by the ionization of electrons from the 1s(A) ground and
1s(E) excited states of N donors to the conduction band while the observed
reduction of the hyperfine (hf) splitting for the Nk1,k2 donors with the
temperature increase is attributed to the motion narrowing effect of the hf
splitting. The temperature dependence of CE ESR linewidth is described by an
exponential law (Orbach process) with the activation energy corresponding to
the energy separation between 1s(A1) and 1s(E) energy levels for N residing at
quasi-cubic sites (Nk1,k2). The theoretical analysis of the temperature
dependence of microwave conductivity measured by the contact-free method shows
that due to the different position of the Fermi level in two samples the

investigate the relation between activity jitter and stellar parameters when

model for a spotted rotating photosphere built from the integration of the
spectral contribution of a fine grid of surface elements. The model includes
all significant effects affecting the flux intensities and the wavelength of
spectral features produced by active regions and planets. A specific
application for the characterization and modelling of the spectral signature of
active regions is considered, showing that the chromatic effects of faculae are
dominant for low temperature contrasts of spots. Synthetic time series are
modelled for HD 189733. Our algorithm reproduces both the photometry and the
RVs to good precision, generally better than the studies published to date. We
evaluate the RV signature of the activity in HD 189733 by exploring a grid of
solutions from the photometry. We find that the use of RV data in the inverse

stellar and activity parameters. In addition, the effects of spots are studied

sampling the random variable assigned to the item with respect to the
distribution assigned to the user who rates the item. Models of that kind are
highly expressive. For instance, using normalized nonnegative models we can
understand users' preferences as mixtures of interpretable user stereotypes,
and we can arrange properties of users and items in a hierarchical manner.
These features would not be useful if the predictive power of normalized
nonnegative models was poor. Thus, we analyze here the performance of
normalized nonnegative models for top-N recommendation and observe that their
performance matches the performance of methods like PureSVD which was
introduced in [Cremonesi et al., 2010]. We conclude that normalized nonnegative
models not only provide accurate recommendations but they also deliver (for
free) representations that are interpretable. We deepen the discussion of
normalized nonnegative models by providing further theoretical insights. In
particular, we introduce total variational distance as an operational
similarity measure, we discover scenarios where normalized nonnegative models
yield unique representations of users and items, we prove that the inference of

candidate to study the intracellular chemistry of single microscopic living
entities. However, due to sensitivity limitations, NMR experiments were
reported only on very few and relatively large single cells down to a minimum
volume of 10 nl. Here we show NMR spectroscopy of single ova at volume scales
(0.1 and 0.5 nl) where life development begins for a broad variety of animals,
humans included. We demonstrate that the sensitivity achieved by miniaturized
inductive NMR probes (few pmol of 1H nuclei in some hours at 7 T) is sufficient
to observe chemical heterogeneities among subnanoliter ova of tardigrades. Such
sensitivities should allow to non-invasively monitor variations of concentrated
intracellular compounds, such as glutathione, in single mammalian zygotes.

paper discusses the testability of low swing repeaterless on-chip interconnects
with equalization and clock synchronization. A capacitively coupled transmitter

mapping from raw depth to segmentation maps is learned in a
semi/weakly-supervised way from two different datasets: (i) a synthetic dataset
created through a rendering pipeline including densely labeled ground truth
(pixelwise segmentations); and (ii) a dataset with real images for which ground
truth joint positions are available, but not dense segmentations. Loss for
training on real images is generated from a patch-wise restoration process,
which aligns tentative segmentation maps with a large dictionary of synthetic
poses. The underlying premise is that the domain shift between synthetic and

geometric and topological meaning, than in the raw input domain. Experiments on
the NYU dataset show that the proposed training method decreases error on
joints over direct regression of joints from depth data by 15.7%.

algorithm that is able to reverse the inflicted damage by restoring the
network's functionality. After damage, each node decides independently whether
to create a new link depending on the fraction of neighbors it has lost. In
addition to relying only on local information, where nodes do not need
knowledge of the global network status, we impose the additional constraint
that new links should be as short as possible (i.e. that the new edge completes
a shortest possible new cycle). We demonstrate that this self-healing method
operates very efficiently, both in model and real networks. For example, after
removing the most connected airports in USA, the self-healing algorithm
re-joined almost 90\% of the surviving airports.

advantage of the serial structure of the data and uses the distance information

addresses two issues that arise with general CNN segmentation architectures.
First, this module propagates information between (super) pixels while
respecting image edges, thus using the structured information of the problem
for improved results. Second, the layer recovers a full resolution segmentation
result from the lower resolution solution of a CNN. In the experiments, we
modify several existing CNN architectures by inserting our inception module

undoubtedly the energy density characterized by a microscopic free parameter;

interesting and useful equation which can be analyzed in astrophysical
scenarios giving now astrophysical constraints. In this sense, this paper is
devoted to explore the astrophysical consequences of an energy density with the
same functional form of NC; mainly in stellar dynamics and rotation curves of
galaxies. We start exploring toy models of stars with incompressible and
polytropic fluids respectively, with the addition and coexistence with this new
fluid. In both cases, we propose an appropriate constriction based on the
difference between a correct and an anomalous behavior. As a complement, we
explore the rotation curves of galaxies assuming that the halo is a fluid with
the same characteristic of a NC equation, obtaining the range of values for the
free parameter through the analysis of eighteen LSB galaxies. Our results are
compared with traditional models studied in literature like Pseudoisothermal
(PISO), Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Burkert and WaveDM dark matter models.
Finally, we have computed the surface density, $\rho_i r_i$ for each dark
matter model, where $i$ is for PISO, NFW, Burkert, WaveDM and NC macroscopic

to large-scale mass flows and the physical effects that drive those motions. We
analyse the bulk motions of voids, defined by the mean velocity of haloes in
the surrounding shells in the numerical simulation, and by galaxies in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. We find void mean bulk velocities
close to 400 km/s, comparable to those of haloes (~ 500-600 km/s), depending on
void size and the large-scale environment. Statistically, small voids move
faster than large ones, and voids in relatively higher density environments
have higher bulk velocities than those placed in large underdense regions.
Also, we analyze the mean mass density around voids finding, as expected,
large-scale overdensities (underdensities) along (opposite to) the void motion
direction, suggesting that void motions respond to a pull-push mechanism. This
contrasts with massive cluster motions who are mainly governed by the pull of
the large-scale overdense regions. Our analysis of void pairwise velocities
shows how their relative motions are generated by large-scale density
fluctuations. In agreement with linear theory, voids embedded in low (high)
density regions mutually recede (attract) each other, providing the general
mechanism to understand the bimodal behavior of void motions. In order to
compare the theoretical results and the observations we have inferred void
motions in the SDSS using linear theory, finding that the estimated
observational void motions are in statisticalagreement with the results of the
simulation. Regarding large-scale flows, our results suggest a scenario of
galaxies and galaxy systems flowing away from void centers with the additional,
and morerelevant, contribution of the void bulk motion to the total velocity.

recombination, and finally subjecting remnant quarks (those which have not
found a recombination partner) to Lund string fragmentation. When applied to
parton showers from the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator, the final hadron spectra
from our calculation compare quite well to PYTHIA jets that have been
hadronized with the default Lund string fragmentation. Modeling the quark gluon

studied medium effects on the hadronization of jet shower partons by also
including their recombination with the thermal partons from the quark gluon

redshift dependence. No redshift or mass dependence is found for the ratio
between SFR and black hole accretion rate (BHAR), which has a mean and scatter
of log (SFR/BHAR) $=3.1 \pm$ 0.5, agreeing with the local mass ratio between
supermassive black hole and host galaxies. The large scatter in this ratio and
the strong AGN-SF correlation found in these IR-bright AGNs are consistent with
the scenario of an AGN-SF dependence on a common gas supply, regardless of the
evolutionary model.

for decades because of their importance in shaping planetary architectures and
compositions. The water snow line lies in the planet formation region at < 10
AU, and so far its location has been estimated only indirectly from
spatially-unresolved spectroscopy. This work presents a proof-of-concept method
to directly image the water snow line in protoplanetary disks through its
physical and chemical imprint in the local dust properties. We adopt a physical
disk model that includes dust coagulation, fragmentation, drift, and a change
in fragmentation velocities of a factor 10 between dry silicates and icy grains
as found by laboratory work. We find that the presence of a water snow line
leads to a sharp discontinuity in the radial profile of the dust emission
spectral index {\alpha}_mm, due to replenishment of small grains through
fragmentation. We use the ALMA simulator to demonstrate that this effect can be
observed in protoplanetary disks using spatially-resolved ALMA images in two
continuum bands. We explore the model dependence on the disk viscosity and find
that the spectral index reveals the water snow line for a wide range of
conditions, with opposite trends when the emission is optically thin rather
than thick. If the disk viscosity is low ({\alpha}_visc < 10^-3) the snow line
produces a ring-like structure with a minimum at {\alpha}_mm ~ 2 in the
optically thick regime, possibly similar to what has been measured with ALMA in
the innermost region of the HL Tau disk.

sequential star formation event in which supernovae shockwaves trigger further
star formation which is enriched in SLRs.
  The sequentially triggered model has been suggested as being more
astrophysically likely than the direct pollution scenario. In this paper we
investigate this claim by analysing a combination of $N$-body and SPH
simulations of star formation. We find that sequential star formation would
result in large age spreads (or even bi-modal age distributions for spatially
coincident events) due to the dynamical relaxation of the first star-formation
event(s). Secondly, we discuss the probability of triggering spatially and
temporally discrete populations of stars and find this to be only possible in
very contrived situations. Taken together, these results suggest that the
formation of the Solar System in a triggered star formation event is as
improbable, if not more so, than the direct pollution of the protosolar disc by

are presented. In individual stars the Ca II triplet (CaT) traces stellar
metallicity; this paper compares integrated CaT strengths to well determined,
high precision [Fe/H] values from high resolution integrated light spectra. The
target globular clusters cover a wide range in metallicity (from [Fe/H] = -2.1
to -0.2). While most are older than 10 Gyr, some may be of intermediate age
(2-6 Gyr). A handful (3-6) have detailed abundances (e.g. low [Ca/Fe]) that
indicate they may have been accreted from dwarf galaxies. Using various
measurements and definitions of CaT strength, it is confirmed that for GCs with
[Fe/H] < -0.4 and older than 2 Gyr the integrated CaT traces cluster [Fe/H] to
within about 0.2 dex, independent of age. CaT lines in metal rich GCs are very
sensitive to nearby atomic lines (and TiO molecular lines in the most metal
rich GCs), largely due to line blanketing in continuum regions. The [Ca/Fe]
ratio has a mild effect on the integrated CaT strength in metal poor GCs. The
integrated CaT can therefore be safely used to determine rough metallicities
for distant, unresolved clusters, provided that attention is paid to the limits

disk angular momentum transport and mass-loss processes. Recent numerical
studies suggest that angular momentum transport in the inner region of PPDs is
largely driven by magnetized disk wind, yet the wind mass-loss rate remains
unconstrained. On the other hand, disk mass loss has conventionally been
attributed to photoevaporation, where external heating on the disk surface
drives a thermal wind. We unify the two scenarios by developing a 1D model of
magnetized disk winds with a simple treatment of thermodynamics as a proxy for
external heating. The wind properties largely depend on 1) the magnetic field
strength at the wind base, characterized by the poloidal Alfv\'en speed
$v_{Ap}$, 2) the sound speed $c_s$ near the wind base, and 3) how rapidly
poloidal field lines diverge (achieve $R^{-2}$ scaling). When $v_{Ap}\gg c_s$,
corotation is enforced near the wind base, resulting in centrifugal
acceleration. Otherwise, the wind is accelerated mainly by the pressure of the
toroidal magnetic field. In both cases, the dominant role played by magnetic
forces likely yields wind outflow rates that well exceed purely hydrodynamical
mechanisms. For typical PPD accretion-rate and wind-launching conditions, we
expect $v_{Ap}$ to be comparable to $c_s$ at the wind base. The resulting wind
is heavily loaded, with total wind mass loss rate likely reaching a
considerable fraction of wind-driven accretion rate. Implications for modeling
global disk evolution and planet formation are also discussed.

of strong lensing or multiplicity, since the typical diameter of dusty

machinery, including Katz's approach to $p$-adic differential operators, his
strategy has influenced four decades of developments. Prior papers employing
Katz's and Serre's ideas exploiting differential operators and congruences to
produce families of automorphic forms rely crucially on $q$-expansions of
automorphic forms.
  The overarching goal of the present paper is to adapt the strategy to
automorphic forms on unitary groups, which lack $q$-expansions when the
signature is of the form $(a, b)$, $a\neq b$. In particular, this paper
completely removes the restrictions on the signature present in prior work. As
intermediate steps, we achieve two key objectives. First, partly by carefully
analyzing the action of the Young symmetrizer on Serre-Tate expansions, we
explicitly describe the action of differential operators on the Serre-Tate
expansions of automorphic forms on unitary groups of arbitrary signature. As a
direct consequence, for each unitary group, we obtain congruences and families
analogous to those studied by Katz and Serre. Second, via a novel lifting
argument, we construct a $p$-adic measure taking values in the space of
$p$-adic automorphic forms on unitary groups of any prescribed signature. We
relate the values of this measure to an explicit $p$-adic family of Eisenstein
series. One application of our results is to the recently completed
construction of $p$-adic $L$-functions for unitary groups by the first named

A naive algorithm can solve this problem using $O(n^3)$ time in total, and its

We show that a conjecture that there is no truly subcubic ($O(n^{3-\epsilon})$)

proving or disproving this conjecture will be very interesting as it will
either imply several tight unconditional lower bounds or break through a common

problems since refuting it will imply a major breakthrough for combinatorial
Boolean matrix multiplication and other long-standing problems if the term

- is not the only important evolutionary aspect in a evolutionary dynamics,
since complex interdependencies, competition, and growth should be modeled by,
for example, reactive aspects. In the ultimatum game the reciprocity and the
fifty-fifty partition seems to be a deviation from rational behavior of the
players under the light of the Nash equilibrium concept.Such equilibrium
emerges, for example, from the punishment of the responder who generally tends
to refuse unfair proposals. In the iterated version of the game, the proposers
are able to improve their proposals by adding a value thus making fairer
proposals. Such evolutionary aspects are not properly Darwinian-motivated, but
they are endowed with a fundamental aspect: they reflect their actions
according to value of the offers. Recently, a reactive version of the ultimatum
game where acceptance occurs with fixed probability was proposed. In this
paper, we aim at exploring this reactive version of the ultimatum game where
the acceptance by players depends on the offer. In order to do so, we analyze
two situations: (i) mean field and (ii) we consider players inserted within the
networks with arbitrary coordination. We then show that the reactive aspect,
here studied, thus far not analyzed in the evolutionary game theory literature
can unveil an essential feature for the convergence to fifty-fifty split.
Moreover we also analyze populations under four different polices ranging from
a highly conservative to a moderate one, with respect to decision in changing
the proposal based on acceptations. We show that the idea of gaining less more
times added to the reciprocity of the players is highly relevant to the

of the singular slow-roll parameters. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that for
some versions of $F(R)$ bigravity, singular inflation is realized in consistent
way so that inflationary indices are compatible with Planck data. Moreover, we
study the late-time behavior of the two singular models and we show that the
unified description of early and late-time acceleration can be achieved in the
context of bimetric $F(R)$ gravity.

energies, we have developed the first systematic survey at energies from 1 to
100 GeV using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Based on the spatial
overlap of sources detected at GeV energies with SNRs known from radio surveys,
we classify 30 sources as likely GeV SNRs. We also report 14 marginal
associations and 245 flux upper limits. A mock catalog in which the positions
of known remnants are scrambled in Galactic longitude, allows us to determine
an upper limit of 22% on the number of GeV candidates falsely identified as

systematic errors arising from the diffuse interstellar emission model, a key
component of all Galactic Fermi LAT analyses. By studying remnants uniformly in
aggregate, we measure the GeV properties common to these objects and provide a
crucial context for the detailed modeling of individual SNRs. Combining our GeV
results with multiwavelength (MW) data, including radio, X-ray, and TeV,
demonstrates the need for improvements to previously sufficient, simple models
describing the GeV and radio emission from these objects. We model the GeV and

carried out by replacing the Poisson bracket by the Dirac bracket. The two
first-class constraints give rise to the Wheeler-DeWitt equations, which yield
uniquely a plane-wave solution for the wavefunction. We also study the
classical solutions of the theory and find that the characteristics of
classical spacetimes are encoded solely in the phase of the plane-wave solution

affected by scattering with the acoustic flexural modes (ZA phonons). This is

Non-$\sigma_{\rm h}$-symmetric, `gapped' 2D crystals (such as semiconducting

affected less severely by the broken $\sigma_{\rm h}$ symmetry, but equally
seriously by the large population of the acoustic flexural modes. We speculate
that reasonable long-wavelength cutoffs needed to stabilize the structure
(finite sample size, grain size, wrinkles, defects) or the anharmonic coupling

mirror-symmetric crystals, like free-standing graphene) may not be sufficient
to raise the electron mobility to satisfactory values. Additional effects (such

freely evolving, nonhelical magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We find that a
necessary and sufficient condition for the kinetic and magnetic energy spectra
to evolve self-similarly is that the initial velocity and magnetic field are
not homogeneous functions of space of different degree, to wit, the initial
energy spectra are not simple powers of the wavenumber with different slopes.
If, instead, they are homogeneous functions of the same degree, the evolution
is self-similar, it proceeds through selective decay, and the order of
homogeneity fixes the exponents of the power laws according to which the
kinetic and magnetic energies and correlation lengths evolve in time. If just
one of them is homogeneous, the evolution is self-similar and such exponents
are completely determined by the slope of that initial spectrum which is a
power law. The latter evolves through selective decay, while the other spectrum
may eventually experience an inverse transfer of energy. Finally, if the
initial velocity and magnetic field are not homogeneous functions, the
evolution of the energy spectra is still self-similar but, this time, the
power-law exponents of energies and correlation lengths depend on a single free
parameter which cannot be determined by scaling arguments. Also in this case,
an inverse transfer of energy may in principle take place during the evolution

contexts: an OSHA database of fatality and catastrophe reports (to facilitate
surveillance for patterns in circumstances leading to injury or death) and
legal decisions on workers' compensation claims (to explore relevant case law).
Our summarization framework, built on sparse classification methods, is a
compromise between simple word frequency based methods currently in wide use,
and more heavyweight, model-intensive methods such as Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA). For a particular topic of interest (e.g., mental health
disability, or chemical reactions), we regress a labeling of documents onto the
high-dimensional counts of all the other words and phrases in the documents.
The resulting small set of phrases found as predictive are then harvested as
the summary. Using a branch-and-bound approach, this method can be extended to
allow for phrases of arbitrary length, which allows for potentially rich
summarization. We discuss how focus on the purpose of the summaries can inform
choices of regularization parameters and model constraints. We evaluate this
tool by comparing computational time and summary statistics of the resulting
word lists to three other methods in the literature. We also present a new R
package, textreg. Overall, we argue that sparse methods have much to offer text
analysis, and is a branch of research that should be considered further in this

It is found that the electron-positron pairs created in the laser field via the

the field. As a result, high energy gamma quanta can be created by inelastic
scattering or annihilation of the pair. Moreover, heavy particles such as muon
pairs may also be created via the annihilation $e^+ + e^-\rightarrow \mu^+ +
\mu^- $. The probability of $e^-e^+$ collision is greatly enhanced due to a
strong alignment of the electron and positron momenta with the electric field.

exponentially exceeds photon emission due to the fermion oscillation.

attributed to architectural innovations such as convolutional and long

innovations is that they capture better domain knowledge, and importantly are
easier to optimize than more basic architectures. Recently, more complex
architectures such as Neural Turing Machines and Memory Networks have been
proposed for tasks including question answering and general computation,
creating a new set of optimization challenges. In this paper, we discuss a
low-overhead and easy-to-implement technique of adding gradient noise which we
find to be surprisingly effective when training these very deep architectures.
The technique not only helps to avoid overfitting, but also can result in lower
training loss. This method alone allows a fully-connected 20-layer deep network
to be trained with standard gradient descent, even starting from a poor
initialization. We see consistent improvements for many complex models,
including a 72% relative reduction in error rate over a carefully-tuned
baseline on a challenging question-answering task, and a doubling of the number
of accurate binary multiplication models learned across 7,000 random restarts.
We encourage further application of this technique to additional complex modern

$d=3$, we obtain recursion relations from which it is possible to generate
rotationally invariant matrix solutions which yield open universes in the
continuum limit. Specific examples of matrix solutions have also been found
which are associated with closed and static two-dimensional space-times in the
continuum limit. The solutions provide for a matrix resolution of cosmological
singularities. The commutative limit reveals other desirable features, such as
a solution describing a smooth transition from an initial inflation to a
noninflationary era. Many of the $d=3$ solutions have analogues in higher
dimensions. The case of $d=5$, in particular, has the potential for yielding
realistic four-dimensional cosmologies in the continuum limit. We find
four-dimensional de Sitter $dS^4$ or anti-de Sitter $AdS^4$ solutions when a
totally antisymmetric term is included in the matrix action. A nontrivial
Poisson structure is attached to these manifolds which represents the lowest
order effect of noncommutativity. For the case of $AdS^4$, we find one
particlular limit where the lowest order noncommutativity vanishes at the
boundary, but not in the interior.

users to run applications under virtual machines. This paper investigates the
energy-aware virtual machine (VM) allocation problems in IaaS clouds along
characteristics: multiple resources, and fixed interval times and
non-preemption of virtual machines. Many previous works proposed to use a
minimum number of physical machines, however, this is not necessarily a good
solution to minimize total energy consumption in the VM placement with multiple
resources, fixed interval times and non-preemption. We observed that minimizing
total energy consumption of physical machines is equivalent to minimize the sum
of total completion time of all physical machines. Based on the observation, we
propose EMinRET algorithm. The EMinRET algorithm swaps an allocating VM with a
suitable overlapped VM, which is of the same VM type and is allocated on the
same physical machine, to minimize total completion time of all physical
machines. The EMinRET uses resource utilization during executing time period of
a physical machine as the evaluation metric, and will then choose a host that
minimizes the metric to allocate a new VM. In addition, this work studies some
heuristics for sorting the list of virtual machines (e.g., sorting by the
earliest starting time, or the longest duration time first, etc.) to allocate
VM. Using the realistic log-trace in the Parallel Workloads Archive, our
simulation results show that the EMinRET algorithm could reduce from 25% to 45%
energy consumption compared with power-aware best-fit decreasing (PABFD)) and
vector bin-packing norm-based greedy algorithms. Moreover, the EMinRET
heuristic has also less total energy consumption than our previous heuristics
(e.g. MinDFT and EPOBF) in the simulations (using same virtual machines sorting
method).

decomposition and spectral search are reduced compared with the complex-valued
KR approach. By designing a special transformation matrix, the influence of the

developed on the new nested array can resolve more sources with reduced

linearized Boltzmann-Peierls equation for phonon transport approach within a
three-phonon scattering framework, we characterize lattice thermal
conductivities k of freestanding silicene, germanene and stanene under
different isotropic tensile strains and temperatures. We find a strong size
dependence of k for silicene with tensile strain, i.e., divergent k with
increasing system size, in contrast, the intrinsic room temperature k for
unstrained silicene converges with system size to 19.34 W/m-K by 178 nm. The
room temperature k of strained silicene becomes as large as that of bulk
silicon by 84 um, indicating the possibility of using strain in silicene to
manipulate k for thermal management. The relative contribution to the intrinsic
k from out-of-plane acoustic modes is largest for unstrained silicene, about
39% at room temperature. The single mode relaxation time approximation, which
works reasonably well for bulk silicon, fails to appropriately describe phonon
thermal transport in silicene, germanene and stanene within the temperature
range considered. For large samples of silicene, k increases with tensile
strain, peaks at about 7% strain and then decreases with further strain. In
germanene and stanene increasing strain hardens and stabilizes long wavelength
out-of-plane acoustic phonons, and leads to similar k behaviors to those of
silicene. These findings further our understanding of phonon dynamics in
group-IV buckled monolayers and may guide transfer and fabrication techniques
of these freestanding samples and engineering k by size and strain for
applications of thermal management and thermoelectricity.

training of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has shown great success in many
machine learning areas including end-to-end speech and handwritten character
recognition. For the CTC training, however, it is required to unroll (or
unfold) the RNN by the length of an input sequence. This unrolling requires a
lot of memory and hinders a small footprint implementation of online learning
or adaptation. Furthermore, the length of training sequences is usually not
uniform, which makes parallel training with multiple sequences inefficient on
shared memory models such as graphics processing units (GPUs). In this work, we
introduce an expectation-maximization (EM) based online CTC algorithm that
enables unidirectional RNNs to learn sequences that are longer than the amount
of unrolling. The RNNs can also be trained to process an infinitely long input
sequence without pre-segmentation or external reset. Moreover, the proposed
approach allows efficient parallel training on GPUs. For evaluation, phoneme
recognition and end-to-end speech recognition examples are presented on the
TIMIT and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpora, respectively. Our online model
achieves 20.7% phoneme error rate (PER) on the very long input sequence that is
generated by concatenating all 192 utterances in the TIMIT core test set. On
WSJ, a network can be trained with only 64 times of unrolling while sacrificing
4.5% relative word error rate (WER).

The systems can be sparse, symmetric or nonsymmetric, and possibly singular. In
many of these applications, the number of constraints is relatively small
compared to the number of unknowns. The traditional null-space method is
inefficient for these systems, because it is expensive to find the null space
explicitly. Some alternatives, notably constraint-preconditioned or projected
Krylov methods, are relatively efficient, but they can suffer from numerical
instability and even nonconvergence. In addition, most existing methods require
the system to be nonsingular or be reducible to a nonsingular system. In this
paper, we propose a new method, called OPINS, for singular and nonsingular
saddle-point systems. OPINS is equivalent to the null-space method with an
orthogonal projector, without forming the orthogonal basis of the null space
explicitly. OPINS can not only solve for the unique solution for nonsingular
saddle-point problems, but also find the minimum-norm solution in terms of the
solution variables for singular systems. The method is efficient and easy to
implement using existing Krylov solvers for singular systems. At the same time,
it is more stable than the other alternatives, such as projected Krylov
methods. We present some preconditioners to accelerate the convergence of OPINS
for nonsingular systems, and compare OPINS against some present
state-of-the-art methods for various types of singular and nonsingular systems.

  informative censoring","23 pages, 8 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In heterogeneous cohorts and those where censoring by non-primary risks is
informative many conventional survival analysis methods are not applicable; the
proportional hazards assumption is usually violated at population level and the
observed crude hazard rates are no longer estimators of what they would have
been in the absence of other risks. In this paper, we develop a fully Bayesian
survival analysis to determine the probabilistically optimal description of a
heterogeneous cohort and we propose a novel means of recovering hazard rates
and survival functions `decontaminated' of the effects of any competing risks.
Most competing risks studies implicitly assume that risk correlations are
induced by cohort or disease heterogeneity that is not captured by covariates.
We additionally assume that proportional hazards hold at the level of
individuals, for all risks, leading to a generic statistical description that
allows us to decontaminate the effects of informative censoring, and from which
Cox regression, frailty and random effects models, and latent class models can
all be recovered as special cases. Synthetic data confirm that our approach can
map a cohort's substructure, and remove heterogeneity-induced false
protectivity and false aetiology effects. Application to survival data from the
ULSAM cohort leads to plausible alternative explanations for previous
counter-intuitive inferences to prostate cancer. The importance of managing
cardiovascular disease as a comorbidity in women diagnosed with breast cancer
is suggested on application to survival data from the AMORIS study.

energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the
observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all
wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were
analyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray
flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were
identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy
distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst
phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to
increase from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to
0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is
found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify
flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the
one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission
spectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected
electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from
relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a
harder injected spectrum. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for
different groups may be related to the acceleration process or to the
environment properties.

from the internal states of CNNs that are trained for high-level tasks, such as
object classification. This work provides a new unsupervised method to learn
semantic parts and gives new understanding of the internal representations of
CNNs. Our technique is based on the hypothesis that semantic parts are
represented by populations of neurons rather than by single filters. We propose
a clustering technique to extract part representations, which we call Visual
Concepts. We show that visual concepts are semantically coherent in that they
represent semantic parts, and visually coherent in that corresponding image
patches appear very similar. Also, visual concepts provide full spatial
coverage of the parts of an object, rather than a few sparse parts as is
typically found in keypoint annotations. Furthermore, We treat single visual
concept as part detector and evaluate it for keypoint detection using the
PASCAL3D+ dataset and for part detection using our newly annotated ImageNetPart
dataset. The experiments demonstrate that visual concepts can be used to detect
parts. We also show that some visual concepts respond to several semantic
parts, provided these parts are visually similar. Thus visual concepts have the
essential properties: semantic meaning and detection capability. Note that our
ImageNetPart dataset gives rich part annotations which cover the whole object,
making it useful for other part-related applications.

impacting almost all visual tasks imaginable. Despite this, few researchers
dare to train their models from scratch. Most work builds on one of a handful
of ImageNet pre-trained models, and fine-tunes or adapts these for specific

these networks from scratch. A small miscalibration of the initial weights
leads to vanishing or exploding gradients, as well as poor convergence
properties. In this work we present a fast and simple data-dependent
initialization procedure, that sets the weights of a network such that all
units in the network train at roughly the same rate, avoiding vanishing or
exploding gradients. Our initialization matches the current state-of-the-art
unsupervised or self-supervised pre-training methods on standard computer
vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection, while being
roughly three orders of magnitude faster. When combined with pre-training
methods, our initialization significantly outperforms prior work, narrowing the

in the ideal case, $UU^\top$ should be block diagonal and thus sparse.
Therefore we propose the Sparse Spectral Clustering (SSC) method which extends
SC with sparse regularization on $UU^\top$. To address the computational issue

on the convex hull of the fixed rank projection matrices. Then the convex SSC

a non-equilibrium asymptotic state. In the general situation, the retrieval of

that in the limit of an infinitesimal coupling, using so-called rotating wave

Floquet-Gibbs state is characterized by a density matrix which is diagonal in
the Floquet basis of the system Hamiltonian with the diagonal elements obeying

solve the problem over a finite number of transmissions and then consider the

important special case of stationary Gaussian noise with finite memory. We show
that the channel capacity at stationarity can be found by solving a
semi-definite program, and hence computationally tractable. We also give new
proofs and results of the non stationary solution which bridges the gap between
results in the literature for the stationary and non stationary feedback
channel capacities. It's shown that a linear communication feedback strategy is

optimal linear strategy is to transmit a linear combination of the information
symbols to be communicated and the innovations for the estimation error of the

key features of POD and DMD. The first mode is the normalized real or imaginary
part of the DMD mode which minimizes the time-averaged residual. The N-th mode
is defined recursively in an analogous manner based on the residual of an
expansion using the first N-1 modes. The resulting recursive DMD (RDMD) modes
are orthogonal by construction, retain pure frequency content and aim at low
residual. RDMD is applied to transient cylinder wake data and is benchmarked
against POD and optimized DMD (Chen et al. 2012) for the same snapshot
sequence. Unlike POD modes, RDMD structures are shown to have pure frequency
content while retaining a residual of comparable order as POD. In contrast to
DMD with exponentially growing or decaying oscillatory amplitudes, RDMD clearly
identifies initial, maximum and final fluctuation levels. Intriguingly, RDMD
outperforms both POD and DMD in the limit cycle resolution from the same
snaphots. RDMD is proposed as an attractive alternative to POD and DMD for
empirical Galerkin models, with nonlinear transient dynamics as a niche
application.

(e.g. body, head and arms, etc.) from natural images is a challenging and
fundamental problem for computer vision. A big difficulty is the large
variability of scale and location for objects and their corresponding parts.
Even limited mistakes in estimating scale and location will degrade the parsing
output and cause errors in boundary details. To tackle these difficulties, we
propose a ""Hierarchical Auto-Zoom Net"" (HAZN) for object part parsing which
adapts to the local scales of objects and parts. HAZN is a sequence of two
""Auto-Zoom Net"" (AZNs), each employing fully convolutional networks that
perform two tasks: (1) predict the locations and scales of object instances
(the first AZN) or their parts (the second AZN); (2) estimate the part scores
for predicted object instance or part regions. Our model can adaptively ""zoom""
(resize) predicted image regions into their proper scales to refine the
parsing.
  We conduct extensive experiments over the PASCAL part datasets on humans,
horses, and cows. For humans, our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-arts by 5% mIOU and is especially better at segmenting small
instances and small parts. We obtain similar improvements for parsing cows and
horses over alternative methods. In summary, our strategy of first zooming into
objects and then zooming into parts is very effective. It also enables us to
process different regions of the image at different scales adaptively so that,
for example, we do not need to waste computational resources scaling the entire
image.

that the mid-nineteenth century (in 1838-1843) giant mass-loss outburst has the
characteristics of being produced by the merger event of a massive close
binary, triggered by the gravitational interaction with a massive third
companion star, which is the current binary companion in the Eta Carinae
system. We come to this conclusion by a combination of theoretical arguments
supported by computer simulations using the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software
Environment. According to this model the $\sim 90$\,\MSun\, present primary
star of the highly eccentric Eta Carinae binary system is the product of this
merger, and its $\sim 30$\,\MSun\, companion originally was the third star in
the system. In our model the Homunculus nebula was produced by an extremely
enhanced stellar wind, energized by tidal energy dissipation prior to the
merger, which enormously boosted the radiation-driven wind mass-loss. The
current orbital plane is then aligned with the equatorial plane of the
Homunculus, and the symmetric lobes are roughly aligned with the argument of
periastron of the current Eta Carina binary. The merger itself then occurred in
1838, which resulted in a massive asymmetric outflow in the equatorial plane of
the Homunculus. The 1843 outburst can in our model be attributed to the
subsequent encounter when the companion star (once the outer most star in the
triple system) plunges through the bloated envelope of the merger product, once
when it passed periastron again. We predict that the system has an excess space
velocity of order 50\,km/s in the equatorial plane of the Homunculus. Our
triple model gives a viable explanation for the high runaway velocities
typically observed in LBVs \citep{2015MNRAS.447..598S}.

Variational Bayes i-vector extractor. This can be used to extract longer
i-vectors reducing the risk of overfittig or to adapt an i-vector extractor
from a database to another with scarce development data. This work is based on
Patrick Kenny's joint factor analysis and Christopher Bishop's variational
principal components.

  Problems","8 pages, Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on
  Information and Communication Technology. arXiv admin note: substantial text
  overlap with arXiv:1511.06825",,,,"cs.DC cs.PF","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  This paper investigates the energy-aware virtual machine (VM) allocation
problems in clouds along characteristics: multiple resources, fixed interval
time and non-preemption of virtual machines. Many previous works have been
proposed to use a minimum number of physical machines, however, this is not
necessarily a good solution to minimize total energy consumption in the VM
placement with multiple resources, fixed interval time and non-preemption. We
observed that minimizing the sum of total busy time of all physical machines
implies minimizing total energy consumption of physical machines. In addition
to, if mapping of a VM onto physical machines have the same total busy time
then the best mapping has physical machine's remaining available resource
minimizing. Based on these observations, we proposed heuristic-based EM
algorithm to solve the energy-aware VM allocation with fixed starting time and
duration time. In addition, this work studies some heuristics for sorting the
list of virtual machines (e.g., sorting by the earliest starting time, or
latest finishing time, or the longest duration time first, etc.) to allocate
VM. We evaluate the EM using CloudSim toolkit and jobs log-traces in the
Feitelson's Parallel Workloads Archive. Simulation's results show that all of
EM-ST, EM-LFT and EM-LDTF algorithms could reduce total energy consumption
compared to state-of-the-art of power-aware VM allocation algorithms. (e.g.
Power-Aware Best-Fit Decreasing (PABFD) [7])).

  authorship dispute and retraction by the journal",,"10.1002/cta.2157",,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, an ultra-fast frequency shift-keying (FSK) modulation
technique based on switched capacitor resonators is presented. It is
demonstrated that switching a reactive component such as a capacitor, in a
high-Q resonator with proper switching signal can preserve the stored energy
and shift it to a different frequency. Switching boundaries are found by
continuity of electric charge and magnetic flux. It is shown that if switching
time is synchronous with zero crossing of the voltage signal across the
switched capacitor, impulsive components can be avoided and continuity of
electric charge is satisfied without energy dissipation. We use this property
to realize a fast binary frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulator with only a
single RF source. In this technique, the modulation rate is independent of the
resonator bandwidth and can be as high as the lower carrier frequency.
Experimental results are presented to validate the simulations.

upper-limb prostheses. However a training session is necessary in order to set
up the controller that will make s-EMG based movement possible. All data
recorded during the training session are used by a machine learning algorithm
to make a posture classification, that will allow the controller to distinguish
each posture. The aim of this study is to investigate if it's possible to make
a posture classification which can remain valid over time. The next step will
be the study of how it varies depending on the amount of information submitted
to it during the training session in view of real life everyday use of the
upper-limb prosthesis.

also developed recently by the present author. Subsequently the concepts were

granular correspondences by her. These have since been used for a new approach
towards comparison of rough algebraic semantics across different semantic
domains by way of correspondences that preserve rough evolution and try to
avoid contamination. In this research paper, new methods are proposed and a
semantics for handling possibly contaminated operations and structured bigness
is developed. These would also be of natural interest for relative consistency
of one collection of knowledge relative other.
