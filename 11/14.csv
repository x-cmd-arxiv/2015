G in which point stabilisers are finite and all infinite normal subgroups are
transitive. That led to two variations. One is the generalisation in which
point stabilisers are merely assumed to satisfy min-N, the minimal condition on
normal subgroups. The groups G are then of two kinds. Either they have a
maximal finite normal subgroup, modulo which they have either one or two
minimal non-trivial normal subgroups, or they have a regular normal subgroup M
which is a divisible abelian p-group of finite rank. In the latter case the
point stabilisers are finite and act irreducibly on a p-adic vector space
associated with M. This leads to our second variation, which is a study of the
finite linear groups that can arise.

small region-of-interest (ROI) using truncated projection data is particularly
appealing due to its potential to lower radiation exposure and reduce the
scanning time. However, ROI reconstruction from truncated projections is an
ill-posed inverse problem, with the ill-posedness becoming more severe when the
ROI size is getting smaller. To address this problem, both ad hoc analytic
formulas and iterative numerical schemes have been proposed in the literature.
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for ROI CT reconstruction,
formulated as a convex optimization problem with a regularized term based on
shearlets. Our numerical implementation consists of an iterative scheme based
on the scaled gradient projection (SGP) method and is tested in the context of
fan beam CT. Our results show that this approach is essentially insensitive to
the location of the ROI and remains very stable also when the ROI size is
rather small.

that the elastic modulus is small enough, a significant deformation takes place
near the contact line, which in turn drastically influences the wetting
behaviour. Depending on the translation velocity of the substrate, the contact
line exhibits different regimes of motions. Continuous motions are observed at
high and low velocities, meanwhile two types of stick-slip motion, periodic and

reproduced irreversible cyanobacterial blooms in vitro. By combining chemical,
biochemical and hydrodynamic evidences, we identify a mechanism, unrelated to
the presence of internal gas vesicles, allowing the sudden collective upward
migration in test tubes of several cyanobacterial strains (Microcystis
aeruginosa PCC 7005, Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 and Synechocystis sp. PCC
6803). The final state consists in a foamy layer of biomass at the air-liquid
interface, in which micro-organisms remain alive for weeks, the medium lying
below being almost completely depleted of cyanobacteria. These ""laboratory
blooms"" start with the aggregation of cells at high ionic force in
cyanobacterial strains that produce anionic extracellular polymeric substances
(EPS). Under appropriate conditions of nutrients and light intensity, the high
photosynthetic activity within cell clusters leads the dissolved oxygen (DO) to
supersaturate and to nucleate into bubbles. Trapped within the EPS, these
bubbles grow until their buoyancy pulls the biomass towards the free surface.
By investigating a wide range of spatially homogeneous environmental conditions
(illumination, salinity, cell and nutrient concentration) we identify
species-dependent thresholds and timescales for bloom formation. We conclude on
the relevance of such results for cyanobacterial bloom formation in the

in by the initial state. Every such initial state leads to a unique and
extended pattern of survivors and non-survivors, which is known as an attractor
of the dynamics. We show that the number of such attractors grows exponentially

small systems. Given this, we construct an analytical approach based on
inhomogeneous mean-field theory to calculate survival probabilities for
arbitrary networks. This powerful (albeit approximate) approach shows how

simple form which depends only on its mass and degree.

oxygen level dependent (BOLD)-like inputs and fMRI outputs. We found that the
de facto quality-metric for task-free fMRI, temporal signal to noise ratio
(tSNR), correlated inversely with dynamic fidelity; thus, studies optimized for
tSNR actually produced time-series that showed the greatest distortion of
signal dynamics. Instead, the phantom showed that dynamic fidelity is
reasonably approximated by a measure that, unlike tSNR, dissociates signal
dynamics from scanner artifact. We then tested this measure, signal fluctuation
sensitivity (SFS), against human resting-state data. As predicted by the

amount of energy transferred from large to the small scales is enhanced in case
of fast turbulent reconnection and energy spectra are used to interpret the
obtained regime of reconnection controlled by the turbulence timescale
$\tau_t$. The overall process is even faster for larger Reynolds numbers
controlled by the background molecular resistivity $\eta$, as long as the
initial level of turbulence is not too large. This implies that turbulence
plays an important role on fast reconnection at situation of large Reynolds

new dimensions are developed by examining the statistics that influence them
the most. In this new high variance, low dimensional space, you can easily
compare statistical profiles across any or all of the principal component

similar or unique. A simple measure of similarity between two player or team
statistical profiles based on the four principal component scores is also
constructed. The Statistical Diversity Index (SDI) allows for quick and
intuitive comparisons using the entirety of the player tracking data. As new
statistics emerge, this framework is scalable as it can incorporate existing

production satisfies the fluctuation theorem. We show that for a range of
{\sigma} values this part can be associated with the breakage of the detailed
balance in the steady state, and can be regarded as a continuous version of the
corresponding entropy production that has been obtained previously for discrete
state variables. The other part of the housekeeping entropy does not satisfy
the fluctuation theorem and is related to the parity asymmetry of the
stationary state distribution. We discuss our results in connection with the
difference between continuous and discrete variable cases especially in the
conditions for the detailed balance and the parity symmetry of the stationary
state distribution.

originates from nonlocal contributions to the free energy and accounts for
possible long-range interactions between the atoms. It is shown that just as in

small corrections to the simple Gaussian peak function, in order to compensate

where the objective is to make predictions in the unobserved portion of the
network. Many existing methods reduce link prediction to binary classification
problem. However, the dominance of absent links in real world networks makes
misclassification error a poor performance metric. Instead, researchers have
argued for using ranking performance measures, like AUC, AP and NDCG, for
evaluation. Our main contribution is to recast the link prediction problem as a
learning to rank problem and use effective learning to rank techniques directly
during training. This is in contrast to existing work that uses ranking
measures only during evaluation. Our approach is able to deal with the class
imbalance problem by using effective, scalable learning to rank techniques
during training. Furthermore, our approach allows us to combine network
topology and node features. As a demonstration of our general approach, we
develop a link prediction method by optimizing the cross-entropy surrogate,
originally used in the popular ListNet ranking algorithm. We conduct extensive
experiments on publicly available co-authorship, citation and metabolic
networks to demonstrate the merits of our method.

unconstrained setting is still limited. We propose a convolutional neural
architecture to estimate reflectance maps of specular materials in natural
lighting conditions. We achieve this in an end-to-end learning formulation that
directly predicts a reflectance map from the image itself. We show how to
improve estimates by facilitating additional supervision in an indirect scheme

map by a learning-based sparse data interpolation.
  In order to analyze performance on this difficult task, we propose a new

  expansion, for improved clarity",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shor's factoring algorithm (SFA), by its ability to efficiently factor large
numbers, has the potential to undermine contemporary encryption. At its heart
is a process called order finding, which quantum mechanics lets us perform
efficiently. SFA thus consists of a \emph{quantum order finding algorithm}
(QOFA), bookended by classical routines which, given the order, return the
factors. But, with probability up to $1/2$, these classical routines fail, and
QOFA must be rerun. We modify these routines using elementary results in number
theory, improving the likelihood that they return the factors.
  The resulting quantum factoring algorithm is better than SFA at factoring
safe semiprimes, an important class of numbers used in cryptography. With just
one call to QOFA, our algorithm almost always factors safe semiprimes. As well
as a speed-up, improving efficiency gives our algorithm other, practical
advantages: unlike SFA, it does not need a randomly picked input, making it
simpler to construct in the lab; and in the (unlikely) case of failure, the
same circuit can be rerun, without modification.
  We consider generalizing this result to other cases, although we do not find
a simple extension, and conclude that SFA is still the best algorithm for
general numbers (non safe semiprimes, in other words). Even so, we present some
simple number theoretic tricks for improving SFA in this case.

identify two integration pathways that are differentiated by infrastructure

includes a tight integration that assumes infrastructure bottlenecks can be
overcome as well as a loose integration that assumes they cannot. We find that
the performance of both approaches is likely to depend on the quantum

with immobile prey and predator using two dispersal strategies. The first
dispersal strategy is driven by the prey-predator interaction strength, and the
second dispersal is prompted by the local population density of predators which
is referred as the passive dispersal. The dispersal strategies using by
predator are measured by the proportion of the predator population using the
passive dispersal strategy which is a parameter ranging from 0 to 1. We focus
on how the dispersal strategies and the related dispersal strengths affect
population dynamics of prey and predator, hence generate different spatial
dynamical patterns in heterogeneous environment. We provide local and global
dynamics of the proposed model. Based on our analytical and numerical analysis,
interesting findings could be summarized as follow: (1) If there is no prey in
one patch, then the large value of dispersal strength and the large predator
population using the passive dispersal in the other patch could drive predator
extinct at least locally. However, the intermediate predator population using
the passive dispersal could lead to multiple interior equilibria and
potentially stabilize the dynamics; (2) For symmetric patches (i.e., all the
life history parameters are the same except the dispersal strengths), the large
predator population using the passive dispersal can generate multiple interior
attractors; (3) The dispersal strategies can stabilize the system, or
destabilize the system through generating multiple interior equilibria that
lead to multiple attractors; and (4) The large predator population using the
passive dispersal could lead to no interior equilibrium but both prey and
predator can coexist through fluctuating dynamics for almost all initial
conditions.

an intelligent and goal-driven adversary. Applications of game theory have led
to a number of results regarding optimal attack and defense strategies.
However, the overwhelming majority of applications explore overly simplistic
games, often ones in which each participant's actions are visible to every
other participant. These simplifications strip away the fundamental properties
of real cyber conflicts: probabilistic alerting, hidden actions, unknown
opponent capabilities.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to analyze a more realistic
game, one in which different resources have different weaknesses, players have
different exploits, and moves occur in secrecy, but they can be detected.
Certainly, more advanced and complex games are possible, but the game presented
here is more realistic than any other game we know of in the scientific
literature. While optimal strategies can be found for simpler games using
calculus, case-by-case analysis, or, for stochastic games, Q-learning, our more
complex game is more naturally analyzed using the same methods used to study
other complex games, such as checkers and chess. We define a simple evaluation
function and ploy multi-step searches to create strategies. We show that such
scenarios can be analyzed, and find that in cases of extreme uncertainty, it is
often better to ignore one's opponent's possible moves. Furthermore, we show
that a simple evaluation function in a complex game can lead to interesting and
nuanced strategies.

a new detector diagnostic technique using piezoelectric sensors to detect
bubbling of the liquid. Bubbling can indicate locations of excess heat
dissipation e.g., in immersed electronics. They can also interfere with normal
event evolution by scattering of light or by interrupting the drift of
ionization charge. In our test apparatus, four sensors are placed in the vacuum
space of a double-walled dewar of liquid nitrogen and used to detect and locate
a source of bubbling inside the liquid volume. Utilizing the differences in
transmitted frequencies through the different media present in the experiment,
we find that sound traveling in a direct path from the source to the sensor can
be isolated with appropriate filtering. The location of the source is then
reconstructed using the time difference of arrivals (TDOA) information. The
reconstruction algorithm is shown to have a 95.8% convergence rate and
reconstructed positions are self-consistent to an average +/-0.5cm around the
mean in x, y, and z. Systematic effects are observed to cause errors in
reconstruction when bubbles occur very close to the surfaces of the liquid

characteristic features of the correlation function of voids including the
first robust detection of BAOs in mock galaxy catalogues. These show an
anti-correlation around the scale corresponding to the smallest size of voids
in the sample (the void exclusion effect), and dips at both sides of the BAO
peak, which can be used to determine the significance of the BAO signal without
any priori model. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that there is a scale
dependent bias for different populations of voids depending on the radius, with
the peculiar property that the void population with the largest BAO
significance corresponds to tracers with approximately zero bias on the largest
scales. We further investigate the methodology on an additional set of 1,000

Another array keeps the adatoms, initially distributed randomly over the

biased diffusion and infinite inverse Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier (iiSE). Since

assumptions about the signal waveform, polarization, source direction, or time
of occurrence. All candidate triggers were consistent with the expected
background; as a result we set 90% confidence upper limits on the rate of
long-duration gravitational wave transients for different types of
gravitational wave signals. For signals from black hole accretion disk
instabilities, we set upper limits on the source rate density between $3.4

operator equations in Banach spaces. The fundamental starting point of the
theory is the idea of residual minimization in dual norms, and its inexact
version using discrete dual norms. It is shown that this development, in the
case of strictly-convex reflexive Banach spaces with strictly-convex dual,
gives rise to a class of nonlinear Petrov-Galerkin methods and, equivalently,
abstract mixed methods with monotone nonlinearity. Crucial in the formulation
of these methods is the (nonlinear) bijective duality map.
  Under the Fortin condition, we prove discrete stability of the abstract
inexact method, and subsequently carry out a complete error analysis. As part
of our analysis, we prove new bounds for best-approximation projectors, which
involve constants depending on the geometry of the underlying Banach space. The
theory generalizes and extends the classical Petrov-Galerkin method as well as
existing residual-minimization approaches, such as the discontinuous
Petrov-Galerkin method.

is the symbolic associations of object-word mappings as it happens in language
development in infants. In other words, two different representations of the

long interested in Artificial Intelligence, Psychology, and Neuroscience. In
this work, we extend a recent approach for multimodal sequences (visual and
audio) to also cope with missing elements in one or both modalities. Our method
uses two parallel Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs) with a learning rule based
on EM-algorithm. It aligns both LSTM outputs via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). We
propose to include an extra step for the combination with the max operation for
exploiting the common elements between both sequences. The motivation behind is
that the combination acts as a condition selector for choosing the best
representation from both LSTMs. We evaluated the proposed extension in the
following scenarios: missing elements in one modality (visual or audio) and
missing elements in both modalities (visual and sound). The performance of our
extension reaches better results than the original model and similar results to
individual LSTM trained in each modality.

variations in pose (in-plane and out-of-plane rotations) and facial expression.
To address this issue, we propose a cascade in which each stage consists of a
mixture of regression experts. Each expert learns a customized regression model
that is specialized to a different subset of the joint space of pose and
expressions. The system is invariant to a predefined class of transformations
(e.g., affine), because the input is transformed to match each expert's
prototype shape before the regression is applied. We also present a method to
include deformation constraints within the discriminative alignment framework,
which makes our algorithm more robust. Our algorithm significantly outperforms
previous methods on publicly available face alignment datasets.

large-scale structure, called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), can be used
as standard rulers to measure the scale of the Universe. These oscillations
have already been detected in the distribution of galaxies. Here we propose to
measure BAOs from the troughs (minima) of the density field. Based on two sets
of accurate mock halo catalogues with and without BAOs in the seed initial
conditions, we demonstrate that the BAO signal cannot be obtained from the
clustering of classical disjoint voids, but is clearly detected from
overlapping voids. The latter represent an estimate of all troughs of the
density field. We compute them from the empty circumsphere centers constrained
by tetrahedra of galaxies using Delaunay triangulation. Our theoretical models
based on an unprecedented large set of detailed simulated void catalogues are
remarkably well confirmed by observational data. We use the largest recently
publicly available sample of luminous red galaxies from SDSS-III BOSS DR11 to
unveil for the first time a >3$\sigma$ BAO detection from voids in
observations. Since voids are nearly isotropically expanding regions, their
centers represent the most quiet places in the Universe, keeping in mind the
cosmos origin and providing a new promising window in the analysis of the
cosmological large-scale structure from galaxy surveys.

divergence of electron beams while they interact with different laser pulses at
intensities where quantum effects and radiation reaction are of relevance. The
interaction is modeled with a QED-PIC code and the results are compared with
those obtained with a standard PIC code with the addition of a classical
radiation reaction module and with theoretical predictions. While classical
radiation reaction is a continuous process, in QED, radiation emission is
stochastic. The two pictures reconcile in the limit when the emitted photons
energy is small compared to the energy of the emitting electrons. The energy
spread of the electron distribution function always tends to decrease with
classical radiation reaction, whereas the stochastic QED emission can also
enlarge it. These two tendencies compete in the QED-dominated regime. Our
analysis, supported by the QED module, reveals an upper limit to the maximal
attainable energy spread due to stochasticity that depends on laser intensity
and the electron beam average energy. Beyond this limit, the energy spread
decreases. These findings are verified for different laser pulse lengths
ranging from short ~ 30 fs pulses presently available to the long ~ 150 fs
pulses expected in the near-future laser facilities, and compared with a
theoretical model. Our results also show that near future experiments will be
able to probe this transition and to demonstrate the competition between
enhanced QED induced energy spread and energy spectrum narrowing from classical
radiation reaction.

dynamic Bayesian networks for which inference is generally exponential in the

assignment which is not restricted by a flat's shape, number of outlets, or
surrounding topography. Flow is modeled by superimposing a gradient away from
higher terrain with a gradient towards lower terrain resulting in a drainage
field exhibiting flow convergence, an improvement over methods which produce
regions of parallel flow. This approach builds on previous work by Garbrecht
and Martz (1997), but presents several important improvements. The improved
algorithm guarantees that flats are only resolved if they have outlets. The
algorithm does not require iterative application; a single pass is sufficient
to resolve all flats. The algorithm presents a clear strategy for identifying
flats and their boundaries. The algorithm is not susceptible to loss of
floating-point precision. Furthermore, the algorithm is efficient, operating in
O( N ) time whereas the older algorithm operates in O( N^(3/2) ) time. In
testing, the improved algorithm ran 6.5 times faster than the old for a 100 x
100 cell flat and 69 times faster for a 700 x 700 cell flat. In tests on actual
DEMs, the improved algorithm finished its processing 38--110 times sooner while
running on a single processor than a parallel implementation of the old
algorithm did while running on 16 processors. The improved algorithm is an
optimal, accurate, easy-to-implement drop-in replacement for the original.

integrable dispersionless multidimensional PDEs is non-local, and the proper
choice of integration constants should be the one dictated by the associated
Inverse Scattering Transform (IST). Using the recently made rigorous IST for
vector fields associated with the so-called Pavlov equation
$v_{xt}+v_{yy}+v_xv_{xy}-v_yv_{xx}=0$, we have recently esatablished that, in
the nonlocal part of its evolutionary form $v_{t}=
v_{x}v_{y}-\partial^{-1}_{x}\,\partial_{y}\,[v_{y}+v^2_{x}]$, the formal
integral $\partial^{-1}_{x}$ corresponding to the solutions of the Cauchy
problem constructed by such an IST is the asymmetric integral
$-\int_x^{\infty}dx'$. In this paper we show that this results could be guessed
in a simple way using a, to the best of our knowledge, novel integral geometry
lemma. Such a lemma establishes that it is possible to express the integral of
a fairly general and smooth function $f(X,Y)$ over a parabola of the $(X,Y)$
plane in terms of the integrals of $f(X,Y)$ over all straight lines non
intersecting the parabola. A similar result, in which the parabola is replaced
by the circle, is already known in the literature and finds applications in
tomography. Indeed, in a two-dimensional linear tomographic problem with a
convex opaque obstacle, only the integrals along the straight lines
non-intersecting the obstacle are known, and in the class of potentials
$f(X,Y)$ with polynomial decay we do not have unique solvability of the inverse
problem anymore. Therefore, for the problem with an obstacle, it is natural not
to try to reconstruct the complete potential, but only some integral
characteristics like the integral over the boundary of the obstacle. Due to the
above two lemmas, this can be done, at the moment, for opaque bodies having as
boundary a parabola and a circle (an ellipse).

the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at linear order in the CIP amplitude.
Here we search for the effects of CIPs on CMB power spectra to quadratic order

upper bound $\Delta_{\rm rms}^2 \leq 7.1\times 10^{-3}$, at the 68\% confidence

now on eccentric orbits, but were born on near-circular orbits at much smaller

non-linear interactions with a strong and long-lived central bar, which greatly
boosted their semi-major axis but also their eccentricity. While bars have been
known to cause radial heating and outward migration to stellar orbits, we link
this effect to the formation of Type-III profiles. This predicts that the
anti-truncated parts of galaxies have unusual kinematics for disc-like stellar
configurations: high radial velocity dispersions and slow net rotation. Whether
such discs exist in nature, can be tested by future observations.

environment, the disc evolution may differ significantly from ideal
magnetohydrodynamic predictions. We present non-ideal global axisymmetric
simulations of geometrically thick discs around a rotating black hole. The
simulations are carried out using a new code ${\rm\it grim}$, which evolves a
covariant extended magnetohydrodynamics model derived by treating non-ideal
effects as a perturbation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Non-ideal effects are
modeled through heat conduction along magnetic field lines, and a difference
between the pressure parallel and perpendicular to the field lines. The model
relies on an effective collisionality in the disc from wave-particle scattering
and velocity-space (mirror and firehose) instabilities. We find that the
pressure anisotropy grows to match the magnetic pressure, at which point it
saturates due to the mirror instability. The pressure anisotropy produces
outward angular momentum transport with a magnitude comparable to that of MHD
turbulence in the disc, and a significant increase in the temperature in the
wall of the jet. We also find that, at least in our axisymmetric simulations,
conduction has a small effect on the disc evolution because (1) the heat flux
is constrained to be parallel to the field and the field is close to
perpendicular to temperature gradients, and (2) the heat flux is choked by an
increase in effective collisionality associated with the mirror instability.

to detect LSB galaxies with similar properties to the known dwarf galaxies of

circumstellar dust disk at high inclination discovered recently by Kervella et
al. (2014b). The signature of the three-dimensional structure of the disk is
clearly observed in the map of the degree of linear polarization pL. We
identify the inner rim of the disk through its polarimetric signature at a
radius of 6 AU from the AGB star. The ZIMPOL intensity images in the V and R
bands also reveal a close-in secondary source at a projected separation of 2 AU
from the primary. The identification of the spectral type of this companion is
uncertain due to the strong reddening from the disk, but its photometry
suggests that it is a late K giant, of comparable mass to the AGB star. We
present refined physical parameters for the dust disk derived using the
RADMC-3D radiative transfer code. We also interpret the pL map using a simple
polarization model to infer the three-dimensional structure of the envelope.
Interactions between the inner binary system and the disk apparently form
spiral structures that propagate along the orthogonal axis to the disk to form
streamers. Two dust plumes propagating orthogonally to the disk are also
detected. They originate in the inner stellar system, and are possibly related
to the interaction of the wind of the two stars with the material in the disk.
Based on the morphology of the envelope of L2 Pup, we propose that this star is
at an early stage of the formation of a bipolar planetary nebula.

envelope inside a radius of 2 to 3 times the near-infrared photospheric radius
of the star (R*), and a significant Halpha emission mostly contained within 3
R*. From the polarimetric signal, we also identify the signature of dust
scattering in an asymmetric and incomplete dust shell located at a similar

on the wind acceleration through radiative pressure on the grains. The 3 R*

systems such as networks of networks. The emergent field of `multilayer
networks' provides a natural framework for extending analyses of ecological
systems to include such multiple layers of complexity, as it specifically
allows one to differentiate and model `intralayer' and `interlayer'
connectivity. The framework provides a set of concepts and tools that can be
adapted and applied to ecology, facilitating research on high-dimensional,
heterogeneous systems in nature. Here, we formally define ecological multilayer
networks based on a review of previous and related approaches, illustrate their
application and potential with analyses of existing data, and discuss
limitations, challenges, and future applications. The integration of multilayer
network theory into ecology offers largely untapped potential to further
address ecological complexity, to ultimately provide new theoretical and
empirical insights into the architecture and dynamics of ecological systems.

larger than expectations from the empirical relation between black hole mass

distortions (RSD), that can discriminate between gravity models while being
independent of clustering bias and $\sigma_8$. While traditionally, the lensing
field for $E_G$ has been probed through galaxy lensing, CMB lensing has been
proposed as a more robust tracer of the lensing field for $E_G$ at higher
redshifts while avoiding intrinsic alignments. We perform the largest-scale
measurement of $E_G$ ever, up to 150 Mpc/$h$, by cross-correlating the Planck

spectrum is harder than the proton spectrum. The AMS experiment has now
reported that the proton-to-helium ratio as function of rigidity $R$
(momentum-to-charge ratio) falls off steadily as p/He $\sim R^\Delta$, with
$\Delta\approx$-0.08 between $R\sim$40 GV and $R\sim$2 TV. Besides, the single
spectra of proton and helium are found to progressively harden at $R\gtrsim$100
GV. The p/He anomaly is generally ascribed to particle-dependent acceleration
mechanisms occurring in Galactic CR sources. However, this explanation poses a
challenge to the known mechanisms of particle acceleration since they are
believed to be ""universal"", composition blind, rigidity mechanisms. Using the
new AMS data, we show that the p/He anomaly can be simply explained in terms of
a two-component scenario where the GeV-TeV flux is ascribed to a hydrogen-rich
source, possibly a nearby supernova remnant, characterized by a soft
acceleration spectrum. This simple idea provides a common interpretation for
the p/He ratio and for the single spectra of proton and helium: both anomalies
are explained by a flux transition between two components. The ""universality""
of particle acceleration in sources is not violated in this model. A
distinctive signature of our scenario is the high-energy flattening of the p/He
ratio at multi-TeV energies, which is hinted at by existing data and will be
resolutely tested by new space experiments ISS-CREAM and CALET.

in the sense of only keeping those superparticles relatively light that are
required to cancel the leading quadratically divergent quantum corrections
(from the top and QCD sector) to the Higgs mass in the Standard Model. The
resulting mass spectra feature higgsinos as the lightest supersymmetric

show a considerable degree of complementarity, i.e. in general many searches
have to be considered in order to check whether a given scenario is allowed. We
delineate allowed and excluded regions in parameter space. For example, we find
that all scenarios where either $m_{\tilde t_1} < 230$ GeV or $m_{\tilde g} <

contrast to some previous studies which suggest a suppression of the

surrounded by higher terrain, with no outlet to lower areas. Filling them so
they are level, as fluid would fill them if the terrain were impermeable, is
often necessary in preprocessing DEMs. The depression-filling algorithm
presented here---called Priority-Flood---unifies and improves on the work of a
number of previous authors who have published similar algorithms. The algorithm
operates by flooding DEMs inwards from their edges using a priority queue to
determine the next cell to be flooded. The resultant DEM has no depressions or
digital dams: every cell is guaranteed to drain. The algorithm is optimal for
both integer and floating-point data, working in O(n) and O(n lg n) time,
respectively. It is shown that by using a plain queue to fill depressions once
they have been found, an O(m lg m) time-complexity can be achieved, where m
does not exceed the number of cells n. This is the lowest time complexity of
any known floating-point depression-filling algorithm. In testing, this
improved variation of the algorithm performed up to 37% faster than the
original. Additionally, a parallel version of an older, but widely-used
depression-filling algorithm required six parallel processors to achieve a
run-time on par with what the newer algorithm's improved variation took on a
single processor. The Priority-Flood Algorithm is simple to understand and
implement: the included pseudocode is only 20 lines and the included C++
reference implementation is under a hundred lines. The algorithm can work on
irregular meshes as well as 4-, 6-, 8-, and n-connected grids. It can also be
adapted to label watersheds and determine flow directions through either
incremental elevation changes or depression carving. In the case of incremental
elevation changes, the algorithm includes safety checks not present in prior
works.

are NP-complete problems; therefore the generally used approach is through
heuristic algorithms. Here, we formulate the problem of finding structures in
networks of neurons in terms of a community detection problem. We introduce a
definition of community and we construct a statistics-based heuristic algorithm

obscured and unobscured quasars, using the angular autocorrelation function and
cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing cross-correlations. Since our recent
work of this kind, the WISE Allwise catalogue was released with improved
photometry, and the Planck mission was completed and released improved
products. These new data provide a more reliable measurement of the quasar bias
and provide an opportunity to explore the role of changing survey pipelines in
results downstream. We present a comparison of IR color-selected quasars, split
into obscured and unobscured populations based on optical-IR colors, selected
from two versions of the WISE data. Which combination of data is used impacts
the final results, particularly for obscured quasars, both because of
mitigation of some systematics and because the newer catalogue provides a
slightly different sample. We show that Allwise data is superior in several
ways, though there may be some systematic trends with Moon contamination that
were not present in the previous catalogue. We opt currently for the most
conservative sample that meet our selection criteria in both the previous and
new WISE catalogues. We measure a higher bias and halo mass for obscured
quasars ($b_{\textrm{obsc}} \sim 2.1$, $b_{\textrm{unob}} \sim 1.8$) --- at
odds with simple orientation models --- but at a reduced significance
($\sim$1.5$\sigma$) as compared to our work with previous survey data.

spread when an individual cow consumes feed containing the infected tissues of
another individual, forming a one-species feedback loop. Such feedback is the
primary means of transmission for BSE during epidemic conditions. Following
outbreaks in the European Union and elsewhere, many governments enacted
legislation designed to limit the spread of such diseases via elimination or
reduction of one-species feedback loops in agricultural systems. However,
two-species feedback loops---those in which infectious material from
one-species is consumed by a secondary species whose tissue is then consumed by
the first species---were not universally prohibited and have not been studied
before. Here we present a basic ecological disease model which examines the
role feedback loops may play in the spread of BSE and related diseases. Our
model shows that there are critical thresholds between the infection's
expansion and decrease related to the lifespan of the hosts, the growth rate of
the prions, and the amount of prions circulating between hosts. The ecological
disease dynamics can be intrinsically oscillatory, having outbreaks as well as
refractory periods which can make it appear that the disease is under control
while it is still increasing. We show that non-susceptible species that have
been intentionally inserted into a feedback loop to stop the spread of disease
do not, strictly by themselves, guarantee its control, though they may give
that appearance by increasing the refractory period of an epidemic's
oscillations. We suggest ways in which age-related dynamics and cross-species
coupling should be considered in continuing evaluations aimed at maintaining a
safe food supply.

relaxations of the stan- dard NP-hard formulation, that can describe both
jigsaws with pieces of unknown position and puzzles of unknown po- sition and

LP assembly strategy. In contrast to existing greedy methods, our LP solver
exploits all the pairwise matches simultaneously, and computes the position of
each piece/component globally. The main ad- vantages of our LP approach
include: (i) a reduced sensi- tivity to local minima compared to greedy
approaches, since our successive approximations are global and convex and (ii)
an increased robustness to the presence of mismatches in the pairwise matches
due to the use of a weighted L1 penalty. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, we test our algorithm on public jigsaw datasets and show that it
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

every $c \times d$ iterations. When a silent error is detected by the
verification mechanism, one can rollback to and re-execute from the last

verification, but we use algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) rather than
stability tests. ABFT can be used for error detection, but also for error
detection and correction, allowing a forward recovery (and no rollback nor
re-execution) when a single error is detected. We introduce an abstract
performance model to compute the performance of all schemes, and we instantiate
it using the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. Finally, we validate
our new approach through a set of simulations.

speed-up for some graphs, if the corresponding graph generating expressions are
given. The reason is that the multi-clique-width is never bigger, but is
exponentially smaller than the clique-width for many graphs. This gap shows up
when the tree-width is basically equal to the multi-clique width as well as
when the tree-width is not bounded by any function of the clique-width.

rule implementing an event-driven form of contrastive divergence enables the
learning of generative models in an on-line fashion. Synaptic sampling machines
perform equally well using discrete-timed artificial units (as in Hopfield
networks) or continuous-timed leaky integrate & fire neurons. The learned
representations are remarkably sparse and robust to reductions in bit precision

followed by cursory re-learning causes a negligible performance loss on
benchmark classification tasks. The spiking neuron-based synaptic sampling

potentially offering substantial advantages in terms of power and complexity,

developed for linear regression models, but has the potential to be extended to
other models. We demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, it is

the PDC is a counterpart to Mallow's Cp but with a lower asymptotic probability

collimated multi-MeV photons with conversion efficiency comparable to the one
expected for these facilities is achievable at an order of magnitude lower in

laser pulse irradiates a bulk solid-density target, heating the target
electrons and inducing relativistic transparency. As the pulse then propagates,
it generates a beam of energetic electrons which in turn drives a strong
azimuthal magnetic field. This field significantly enhances the radiation
reaction for the electrons, yielding tens of TW of directed MeV photons for a
PW-class laser.

a universal, galactocentric-distance-independent stochastic process, on the

recently gained new impetus through the publication of a study that concluded
that the maximum cluster mass in a given population is not solely determined by
size-of-sample effects. Here, we revisit the evidence in favor and against
stochastic cluster formation by examining the young ($\lesssim$ a few $\times
10^8$ yr-old) star cluster mass--galactocentric radius relation in M33, M51,
M83, and the Large Magellanic Cloud. To eliminate size-of-sample effects, we
first adopt radial bin sizes containing constant numbers of clusters, which we
use to quantify the radial distribution of the first- to fifth-ranked most
massive clusters using ordinary least-squares fitting. We supplement this
analysis with an application of quantile regression, a binless approach to
rank-based regression taking an absolute-value-distance penalty. Both methods
yield, within the $1\sigma$ to $3\sigma$ uncertainties, near-zero slopes in the
diagnostic plane, largely irrespective of the maximum age or minimum mass
imposed on our sample selection, or of the radial bin size adopted. We conclude
that, at least in our four well-studied sample galaxies, star cluster formation
does not necessarily require an environment-dependent cluster formation
scenario, which thus supports the notion of stochastic star cluster formation
as the dominant star cluster-formation process within a given galaxy.

projection chamber located at the 4850 ft level of the Sanford Underground

dark matter searches relies on their ability to distinguish electron recoil
(ER) background events from nuclear recoil (NR) signal events. Typically, the
NR-ER discrimination is obtained from the ratio of the electroluminescence
light (S2) to the prompt scintillation light (S1). Analysis of the S1 pulse
shape is an additional discrimination technique that can be used to distinguish
NR from ER. Pulse-shape NR-ER discrimination can be achieved based on the ratio
of the de-excitation processes from singlet and triplet states that generate
the S1. The NR S1 is dominated by the de-excitation process from singlet states
with a time constant of about 3 ns while the ER S1 is dominated by the
de-excitation process from triplet states with a time constant of about 24 ns.
As the size of the detectors increases, the variation in the S1 photon flight
path can become comparable to these decay constants, reducing the utility of
pulse-shape analysis to separate NR from ER. The effect of path length
variations in the LUX detector has been studied using the results of
simulations and the impact on the S1 pulse shape analysis is discussed.

  Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning algorithms have been shown to perform extremely well on many
classical machine learning problems. However, recent studies have shown that
deep learning, like other machine learning techniques, is vulnerable to
adversarial samples: inputs crafted to force a deep neural network (DNN) to
provide adversary-selected outputs. Such attacks can seriously undermine the
security of the system supported by the DNN, sometimes with devastating
consequences. For example, autonomous vehicles can be crashed, illicit or
illegal content can bypass content filters, or biometric authentication systems
can be manipulated to allow improper access. In this work, we introduce a
defensive mechanism called defensive distillation to reduce the effectiveness
of adversarial samples on DNNs. We analytically investigate the
generalizability and robustness properties granted by the use of defensive
distillation when training DNNs. We also empirically study the effectiveness of
our defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarial settings. The study
shows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample creation
from 95% to less than 0.5% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic gains can be
explained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used in adversarial
sample creation to be reduced by a factor of 10^30. We also find that
distillation increases the average minimum number of features that need to be
modified to create adversarial samples by about 800% on one of the DNNs we
tested.

detail in computer vision community, where incorporating multi-level contextual
information is critical for achieving such fine-grained pixel-level

post-processing predicted confidence maps. In this work, we propose a novel
deep Local-Global Long Short-Term Memory (LG-LSTM) architecture to seamlessly
incorporate short-distance and long-distance spatial dependencies into the
feature learning over all pixel positions. In each LG-LSTM layer, local
guidance from neighboring positions and global guidance from the whole image
are imposed on each position to better exploit complex local and global
contextual information. Individual LSTMs for distinct spatial dimensions are
also utilized to intrinsically capture various spatial layouts of semantic
parts in the images, yielding distinct hidden and memory cells of each position
for each dimension. In our parsing approach, several LG-LSTM layers are stacked
and appended to the intermediate convolutional layers to directly enhance
visual features, allowing network parameters to be learned in an end-to-end
way. The long chains of sequential computation by stacked LG-LSTM layers also
enable each pixel to sense a much larger region for inference benefiting from
the memorization of previous dependencies in all positions along all
dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on three public datasets well demonstrate
the significant superiority of our LG-LSTM over other state-of-the-art methods.

cavities through a linear static network is used to produce the correct

foreground mask of the dominant object instance in each proposal. By being
recursive, R2-IOS iteratively optimizes the two sub-networks during joint
training, in which the refined object proposals and improved segmentation
predictions are alternately fed into each other to progressively increase the

adaptively determines an optimal number of refinement iterations required for

26 days in the rest frame (z=0.256). During this period, we do not detect any
statistically significant evolution (< 2$\sigma$) in the Stokes parameters. The
average values we obtain, corrected for interstellar polarisation in the
Galaxy, are Q = -0.01% ($\pm$ 0.15%) and U = - 0.50% ($\pm$ 0.14%). This low
polarisation can be entirely due to interstellar polarisation in the SN host
galaxy. We conclude that, at least during the period of observations and at the
optical depths probed, the photosphere of LSQ14mo does not present significant
asymmetries, unlike most lower-luminosity hydrogen-poor SNe Ib/c.
Alternatively, it is possible that we may have observed LSQ14mo from a special
viewing angle. Supporting spectroscopy and photometry confirm that LSQ14mo is a
typical SLSN I. Further studies of the polarisation of Type I SLSNe are

individuals play a key role in many phenomena, from the growth of bacterial
colonies to the coordination of robotic swarms. For these collective behaviours
to take hold, the individuals must be able to emit, sense and react to signals.
When dealing with simple organisms and robots, these signals are necessarily
very elementary, e.g. a cell might signal its presence by releasing chemicals
and a robot by shining light. An additional challenge arises because the motion
of the individuals is often noisy, e.g. the orientation of cells can be altered
by Brownian motion and that of robots by an uneven terrain. Therefore, the
emphasis is on achieving complex and tunable behaviors from simple autonomous
agents communicating with each other in robust ways. Here, we show that the
delay between sensing and reacting to a signal can determine the individual and
collective long-term behavior of autonomous agents whose motion is
intrinsically noisy. We experimentally demonstrate that the collective
behaviour of a group of phototactic robots capable of emitting a radially
decaying light field can be tuned from segregation to aggregation and
clustering by controlling the delay with which they change their propulsion
speed in response to the light intensity they measure. We track this transition
to the underlying dynamics of this system, in particular, to the ratio between
the robots' sensorial delay time and the characteristic time of the robots'
random reorientation. Supported by numerics, we discuss how the same mechanism
can be applied to control active agents, e.g. airborne drones, moving in a
three-dimensional space.

axis for the purpose of function approximation in weighted Hardy spaces. In
particular, we consider the Hardy space of functions that are analytic in a
strip region around the real axis, being characterized by a weight function $w$
that determines the decay rate of its elements in the neighborhood of infinity.
Such a space is considered as a set of functions that are transformed by
variable transformations that realize a certain decay rate at infinity. Popular
examples of such transformations are given by the single exponential (SE) and
double exponential (DE) transformations for the SE-Sinc and DE-Sinc formulas,
which are very accurate owing to the accuracy of sinc interpolation in the
weighted Hardy spaces with single and double exponential weights $w$,
respectively. However, it is not guaranteed that the sinc formulas are optimal
in weighted Hardy spaces, although Sugihara has demonstrated that they are near
optimal. An explicit form for an optimal approximation formula has only been
given in weighted Hardy spaces with SE weights of a certain type. In general
cases, explicit forms for optimal formulas have not been provided so far. We
adopt a potential theoretic approach to obtain almost optimal formulas in
weighted Hardy spaces in the case of general weight functions $w$. We formulate
the problem of designing an optimal formula in each space as an optimization
problem written in terms of a Green potential with an external field. By
solving the optimization problem numerically, we obtain an almost optimal
formula in each space. Furthermore, some numerical results demonstrate the
validity of this method. In particular, for the case of a DE weight, the
formula designed by our method outperforms the DE-Sinc formula.

to be determined prior to their real service life. Such properties can be
assured by destructive and non-destructive tests. In this paper, a novel
non-destructive test (NDT) method based on flexural free vibration is
introduced to investigate the viscoelastic properties of fiber-reinforced
composites. Three different types of industrial fibers (carbon, glass, and
hemp) and an unsaturated polyester resin were selected to produce bar-shaped
composites via pultrusion technique. These composite bars were used in a simple
NDT method which just required a wooden hammer, two elastic jaws, a microphone
and a recorder software program to perform the experiment. The composite bars
were mounted on elastic jaws and hit by a wooden hammer at one end of the
specimen as a perpendicular impulse. The produced sound at the other side of
the bars was recorded. By analyzing the recorded sounds by means of fast
Fourier transform (FFT), viscoelastic properties such as flexural elastic
modulus and the loss parameter (Tan {\delta}) were calculated for the
fiber-reinforced composites. For determination of flexural elastic modulus, the
first three modes of vibration in FFT graphs were analyzed using Temuschenco
theory. Also, Tan {\delta} was determined by analyzing the drop in the
intensity of vibrational energy as a function of time. Although there was a
slight discrepancy between the calculated values from the NDT method and the
actual data from dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) approach, a good
agreement was achieved between NDT and DMTA results.

Based on opto thermal properties, the augmented temperature and shift of the

contradictions. To fill the void, inter particle and particle fluid
interactivities (slip mechanisms), in addition to effective thermophysical
properties, have been incorporated within the present formulation. Through
thorough scaling analysis, the dominant slip mechanisms have been identified. A
Multi Component Lattice Boltzmann Model (MCLBM) approach has been proposed,
wherein the suspension has been treated as a non homogeneous twin component
mixture with the governing slip mechanisms incorporated. The computations based
on the mathematical model can accurately predict and quantify natural
convection thermal transport in nanosuspensions. The role of slip mechanisms
such as Brownian diffusion, thermophoresis, drag, Saffman lift, Magnus effect,
particle rotation and gravitational effects have been pictured articulately. A
comprehensive study on the effects of Rayleigh number, particle size and
concentration reveals that the drag force experienced by the particles is
dominantly responsible for deterioration of natural convective thermal
transport. In essence, the dominance of Stokesian mechanics in such
thermofluidic systems is established in the present study. For the first time,

predicts accurately and reveals the crucial mechanisms and physics of buoyancy

Analytical methods and simulations predict an increased power efficiency of

cost of this advantage is evaluated considering the limited applicability in

  Four-dimensional signalling also implies simultaneous reception on both

that the $F(R)$ gravity can be arbitrarily chosen, so we can have the appealing
features of the mimetic approach combined with the known features of some
$F(R)$ gravities, which unify early-time with late-time acceleration. Moreover,
we study the existence and the stability of de Sitter points in the context of

given a smooth manifold $M$ and a symmetric 2-tensor $r$, construct a metric on
$M$ whose Ricci tensor equals $r$. In particular, DeTurck and Koiso proved the
following celebrated result: the Ricci curvature uniquely determines the
Levi-Civita connection on any compact Einstein manifold with non-negative
section curvature. In the present paper we generalize the result of DeTurck and
Koiso for a Riemannian manifold with non-negative section curvature. In
addition, we extended our result to complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds
with nonnegative sectional curvature and with finite total scalar curvature.

the axial-vector to lepton vector currents a_f v_l and the couplings of the
axial-vector to quark vector currents a_f v_q are derived within data on the

takes into consideration the behaviour of the differential cross-section which
exhibits itself if the derived already special relations between the couplings
proper to the renormalizable theories are accounted for. In particular, they
hold in all the models of Abelian Z' usually considered in the model-dependent
analysis of the LHC data. The coupling values are estimated at ~ 92 % CL by
means of the maximum likelihood function. They weakly depend on the Z' mass in
the investigated interval 1.2 TeV < m_Z' < 5 TeV. Taking into account the
dependence of Z-Z' mixing angle theta_0 on m_Z' and the LEP constraints

This equation is critical in the sense that the source term has the form
$K(x)|u|^{q(x)-2}u$ with an exponent $q$ that can be equal to the critical
exponent $p^*$ at some points of $\mathbb{R}^N$ including at infinity. The
sufficient existence conditions we find are local in the sense that they depend
only on the behaviour of the exponents $p$ and $q$ near these points. We stress
that we do not assume any symmetry or periodicity of the coefficients of the
equation and that $K$ is not required to vanish in some sense at infinity like
in most existing results. The proof of these local existence conditions is
based on a notion of localized best Sobolev constant at infinity and a refined
concentration-compactness at infinity.
