a linear expansion of a countable sequence of random variables which are
independently and identically uniformly distributed in a compact interval. The
multiscale Hellinger-Reissner problem that allows for computing the stress
directly, and the multiscale mixed problem for nearly incompressible isotropic
materials are considered. The stochastic problems are studied via deterministic
problems that depend on a countable number of real parameters. We study the
multiscale homogenized problems that contain all the macroscopic and
microscopic information, whose solutions are written as generalized polynomial
chaos (gpc) expansions. We approximate these solutions by semidiscrete Galerkin
approximating problems that project into the spaces of functions with only a
finite number of $N$ gpc modes. We deduce bounds and summability properties for
the solutions' gpc expansion coefficients, which imply explicit rates of
convergence in terms of $N$ when the gpc modes used for the Galerkin
approximation are chosen to correspond to the best $N$ terms in the gpc
expansion. For the mixed problem for nearly incompressible materials, the rate
of convergence for the best $N$ term approximation is independent of the Lam\'e
constants' ratio. We establish parametric correctors in terms of the
semidiscrete Galerkin approximations. For two scale problems, an explicit
homogenization rate is deduced. Together with the best $N$ term rate, it
provides an explicit convergence rate for the correctors of the parametric
multiscale problems. For nearly incompressible materials, we obtain a
homogenization rate that is independent of the ratio of the Lam\'e constants,
so that the error for the corrector is also independent of this ratio.

can arise from a $Z'$ boson which acquires mass through a $U(1)_X$ Stueckelberg
extension. The corresponding $Z'$ gauge boson is leptophobic with a mass of
around 2 TeV and has interactions with $SU(2)_L$ Yang-Mills fields and gauge
fields of the hypercharge. The analysis predicts $Z'$ decays into $WW$ and $ZZ$
as well as into $Z\gamma$. Further three-body as well as four-body decays of
the $Z'$ such as $WWZ, WW\gamma, WWZZ$ etc are predicted. In the analysis we
use the helicity formalism which allows us to exhibit the helicity structure of
the $Z'$ decay processes in an transparent manner. In particular, we are able
to show the set of vanishing helicity amplitudes in the decay of the massive
$Z'$ into two vector bosons due to angular momentum conservation with a special
choice of the reference momenta. The residual set of non-vanishing helicity
amplitudes are identified. The parameter space of the model compatible with the
diboson excess seen by the ATLAS experiment at $\sqrt s=8$ TeV is exhibited.
Estimate of the diboson excess expected at $\sqrt s= 13$ TeV with 20 fb$^{-1}$
of integrated luminosity at LHC run II is also given. It is shown that the
$WW$, $ZZ$ and $Z\gamma$ modes are predicted to be in the approximate ratio
$1:\cos^2\theta_W (1+ \alpha \tan^2\theta_W)^2/2: (1-\alpha)^2\sin^2\theta_W/2$
where $\alpha$ is the relative strength of the couplings of hypercharge gauge
fields to the couplings of the Yang-Mills gauge fields. Thus observation of the
$Z\gamma$ mode as well as three-body and four-body decay modes of the $Z'$ will
provide a definite test of the model and of a possible new source of

Pronounced $q_T$ dependencies of the $\lambda$ and $\nu$ parameters,

found. Violation of the Lam-Tung relation was also clearly observed. We show
that the $q_T$ dependence of $\lambda$ allows a determination of the relative

The violation of the Lam-Tung relation is attributed to the presence of a
non-zero component of the $q - \bar q$ axis in the direction normal to the
""hadron plane"" formed by the colliding hadrons. The magnitude of the violation
of the Lam-Tung relation is shown to reflect the amount of this

training samples of all the classes. This collaborative representation is then
used to label the test sample. It was a common belief that sparseness of the
representation is the key to success for this classification scheme. However,
more recently, it has been claimed that it is the collaboration and not the
sparseness that makes the scheme effective. This claim is attractive as it
allows to relinquish the computationally expensive sparsity constraint over the
representation. In this paper, we first extend the analysis supporting this
claim and then show that sparseness explicitly contributes to improved
classification, hence it should not be completely ignored for computational
gains. Inspired by this result, we augment a dense collaborative representation
with a sparse representation and propose an efficient classification method
that capitalizes on the resulting representation. The augmented representation
and the classification method work together meticulously to achieve higher
accuracy and lower computational time compared to state-of-the-art
collaborative representation based classification approaches. Experiments on

transport mechanisms such as diffusion. This can result in inter-symbol

establish support recovery guarantees and deviation bounds for a family of

recursive linear structural equation model, which reduces the estimation
problem to a series of neighbourhood regressions. We provide a novel
statistical analysis of these neighbourhood problems, establishing uniform

structure of functions on $\pi_1(X-\{\infty\},e)$ given by iterated integrals
of length $\leq n$ (as defined by Hain). In the geometric part, inspired by a
work of Darmon, Rotger, and Sols, we express the mixed Hodge extension
$\mathbb{E}^\infty_{n,e}$ given by the weight filtration on
$\frac{L_n}{L_{n-2}}$ in terms of certain null-homologous algebraic cycles on
$X^{2n-1}$. As a corollary, we show that the extension
$\mathbb{E}^\infty_{n,e}$ determines the point $\infty\in X-\{e\}$. The
arithmetic part of the paper gives some number-theoretic applications of the

X_0(K)$, where $K$ is a subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ and $X_0$ is a projective
curve over $K$. Let $Jac$ be the Jacobian of $X_0$. We use the extension
$\mathbb{E}^\infty_{n,e}$ to associate to each $Z\in CH_{n-1}(X_0^{2n-2})$ a
point $P_Z\in Jac(K)$, which can be described analytically in terms of iterated
integrals. The proof of $K$-rationality of $P_Z$ uses that the algebraic cycles
constructed in the geometric part of the paper are defined over $K$. Assuming a
certain plausible hypothesis on the Hodge filtration on $L_n(X-\{\infty\},e)$
holds, we show that an algebraic cycle $Z$ for which $P_Z$ is torsion, gives
rise to relations between periods of $L_2(X-\{\infty\},e)$. Interestingly,
these relations are non-trivial even when one takes $Z$ to be the diagonal of
$X_0$. The geometric result of the paper in $n=2$ case, and the fact that one
can associate to $\mathbb{E}^\infty_{2,e}$ a family of points in $Jac(K)$, are
due to Darmon, Rotger, and Sols. Our contribution is in generalizing the

  Interpolation",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While the recent theory of compressed sensing provides an opportunity to
overcome the Nyquist limit in recovering sparse signals, a solution approach
usually takes a form of inverse problem of the unknown signal, which is
crucially dependent on specific signal representation. In this paper, we
propose a drastically different two-step Fourier compressive sampling framework
in continuous domain that can be implemented as a measurement domain
interpolation, after which a signal reconstruction can be done using classical
analytic reconstruction methods. The main idea is originated from the
fundamental duality between the sparsity in the primary space and the
low-rankness of a structured matrix in the spectral domain, which shows that a
low-rank interpolator in the spectral domain can enjoy all the benefit of
sparse recovery with performance guarantees. Most notably, the proposed
low-rank interpolation approach can be regarded as a generalization of recent
spectral compressed sensing to recover large class of finite rate of
innovations (FRI) signals at near optimal sampling rate. Moreover, for the case
of cardinal representation, we can show that the proposed low-rank
interpolation will benefit from inherent regularization and the optimal
incoherence parameter. Using the powerful dual certificates and golfing scheme,
we show that the new framework still achieves the near-optimal sampling rate
for general class of FRI signal recovery, and the sampling rate can be further
reduced for the class of cardinal splines. Numerical results using various type
of FRI signals confirmed that the proposed low-rank interpolation approach has
significant better phase transition than the conventional CS approaches.

potentials and limitations of training-based multiuser multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In a multiuser MIMO system, users are
geographically separated. So, the near-far effect plays an indispensable role
in channel fading. The existing optimal training design for conventional MIMO
does not take the near-far effect into account, and thus is not applicable to a
multiuser MIMO system. In this work, we use the majorization theory as a basic
tool to study the tradeoff between the channel estimation quality and the
information throughput. We establish tight upper and lower bounds of the
throughput, and prove that the derived lower bound is asymptotically optimal
for throughput maximization at high signal-to-noise ratio. Our analysis shows
that the optimal training sequences for throughput maximization in a multiuser
MIMO system are in general not orthogonal to each other. Furthermore, due to
the near-far effect, the optimal training design for throughput maximization is
to deactivate a portion of users with the weakest channels in transmission.
These observations shed light on the practical design of training-based
multiuser MIMO systems.

(SNRs) is crucial to determine the rates of supernova (SN) explosions in a
galaxy, which is a key to understand its recent chemical evolution. However,
evolved SNRs in the so-called Sedov phase are dominated by the swept-up
interstellar medium (ISM), making it difficult to determine their ejecta
composition and thus SN type. Here we present a systematic X-ray study of nine
evolved SNRs in the Magellanic Clouds, DEM L238, DEM L249, 0534-69.9,
0548-70.4, B0532-71.0, B0532-67.5, 0103-72.6, 0049-73.6, and 0104-72.3, using
archival data of the Suzaku satellite. Although Suzaku does not spatially
resolve the SN ejecta from the swept-up ISM due to the limited angular
resolution, its excellent energy resolution has enabled clear separation of
emission lines in the soft X-ray band. This leads to the finding that the
`spatially-integrated' spectra of the evolved (~10^4 yr) SNRs are still
significantly contributed by emission from the ejecta at the energies around 1
keV. The Fe/Ne mass ratios, determined mainly from the well-resolved Fe L-shell
and Ne K-shell lines, clearly divide the observed SNRs into the Type Ia and
core-collapse groups, confirming some previous typing made by Chandra
observations that had utilized its extremely high angular resolution. This
demonstrates that spatially-integrated X-ray spectra of old SNRs can also be
used to discriminate their progenitor type, which would be helpful for future
systematic studies of extragalactic SNRs with ASTRO-H and beyond.

order hyperbolic formulation of continuum mechanics recently proposed by
Peshkov & Romenski, denoted as HPR model. In that framework, the viscous
stresses are computed from the so-called distortion tensor A, which is one of
the primary state variables. A very important key feature of the model is its
ability to describe at the same time the behavior of inviscid and viscous
compressible Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with heat conduction, as well
as the behavior of elastic and visco-plastic solids. This is achieved via a
stiff source term that accounts for strain relaxation in the evolution
equations of A. Also heat conduction is included via a first order hyperbolic
evolution equation of the thermal impulse, from which the heat flux is
computed. The governing PDE system is hyperbolic and fully consistent with the
principles of thermodynamics. It is also fundamentally different from first
order Maxwell-Cattaneo-type relaxation models based on extended irreversible
thermodynamics. The connection between the HPR model and the classical
hyperbolic-parabolic Navier-Stokes-Fourier theory is established via a formal
asymptotic analysis in the stiff relaxation limit. From a numerical point of
view, the governing partial differential equations are very challenging, since
they form a large nonlinear hyperbolic PDE system that includes stiff source
terms and non-conservative products. We apply the successful family of one-step
ADER-WENO finite volume and ADER discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes
in the stiff relaxation limit, and compare the numerical results with exact or
numerical reference solutions obtained for the Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations. To show the universality of the model, the paper is rounded-off with
an application to wave propagation in elastic solids.

query in which a user provides a set of example entities as the query and
obtains in return some entities that best complete the concept underlying the
given query. Such entity acquisition queries can be useful in many applications
such as related-entity recommendation and query expansion. A number of ESbE
query processing solutions exist in the literature. However, they mostly build
only on the idea of entity co-occurrences either in text or web lists, without
taking advantage of the existence of many web-scale conceptual taxonomies that
consist of hierarchical isA relationships between entity-concept pairs. This
paper provides a query processing method based on the relevance models between
entity sets and concepts. These relevance models can be used to obtain the
fine-grained concepts implied by the query entity set, and the entities that
belong to a given concept, thereby providing the entity suggestions. Extensive
evaluations with real data sets show that the accuracy of the queries processed
with this new method is significantly higher than that of existing solutions.

an invariant differential on $E$. Let $L(E,s)$ be the $L$-function of $E$. In
this setting, it is known that $L(E,s)$ possesses an analytic continuation to
$\mathbb C$. The period of $E$ can be written (up to a power of $2$) as the
product of the Tamagawa numbers of $E$ with $\Omega_E/\sqrt{|\Delta_K|}$, where
$\Omega_E$ is a quantity, independent of $\omega_E$, which encodes the real
periods of $E$ when $K$ is real and the covolume of the period lattice of $E$

$L(E,1)\neq 0$ then $L(E,1)\cdot Q\cdot\sqrt{|\Delta_K|}/\Omega_E$ is an

order to improve the 3D mapping of the matter density in the Eridanus

Our tomographic imaging reveals important substructure in the Eridanus
supervoid, with a potential interpretation of a long, fully connected system of
voids. We improve the analysis by extending the line-of-sight measurements into
the antipodal direction that interestingly crosses the Northern Local Supervoid
at the lowest redshifts. Then it intersects very rich superclusters like
Hercules and Corona Borealis, in the region of the Coma and Sloan Great Walls,

find that large-scale structure measurements are consistent with a central
matter underdensity $\delta_0 \approx -0.25$, projected transverse radius
$r_{0}^{\perp}\approx 195$ Mpc/h with an extra deepening in the centre, and
line-of-sight radius $r_{0}^{\parallel}\approx500$ Mpc/h, i.e. an ellipsoidal

concept list, by identifying related concepts of the query concept. However, as
such increase of recall often invites false positives and decreases precision
in return, we propose the following two techniques: First, we identify concepts
with different relatedness to generate linear orderings and pairwise ordering
constraints. Second, we rank entities trying to avoid conflicts with these
constraints, to prune out lowly ranked one (likely false positives). With these
novel techniques, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts.

vectors to be transmitted to K users, the problem is to find an OFDM-modulated

cancellation. Unlike previous works that tackled the problem using convex
optimization, we take a Bayesian approach and develop an efficient PAPR
reduction method by exploiting the redundant degrees-of-freedom of the transmit
array. The sought-after signal is treated as a random vector with a
hierarchical truncated Gaussian mixture prior, which has the potential to
encourage a low PAPR signal with most of its samples concentrated on the
boundaries. A variational expectation-maximization (EM) strategy is developed
to obtain estimates of the hyperparameters associated with the prior model,
along with the signal. In addition, the generalized approximate message passing
(GAMP) is embedded into the variational EM framework, which results in a
significant reduction in computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.
Simulation results show our proposed algorithm achieves a substantial
performance improvement over existing methods in terms of both the PAPR
reduction and computational complexity.

intuition as such nano oils possess substantially higher positive dielectric
breakdown voltage with reduced streamer velocities than the base oils. Nano
oils comprising stable and dilute homogeneous dispersions of two forms of
titanium (IV) oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (Anatase and Rutile) have been
experimentally examined and observed to exhibit highly enhanced dielectric
breakdown strength compared to conventional transformer oils. Indepth survey of
literature yields that research on enhancing insulation properties of mineral
oils by utilizing anatase and rutile titania nanoparticles is nought. The
present study involves titania dispersed in two different grades of transformer
oils, both with varied levels of thermal treatment, to obtain consistent and
high degrees of enhancement in the breakdown strength, as well as high degrees
of increment in the survival of the oils at elevated electrical stressing
compared to the base oils, as obtained via detailed twin parameter Weibull
distribution analysis of the experimental observations. It is also observed
that heat treatment of the nano oils further enhances the dielectric breakdown
performance. Additionally, further enhancements are observed at elevated
operational temperatures. Detailed studies on the performance of the nano oils
in presence of variant quantities of moisture have also been put forward. The
grossly different charging dynamics of dielectric nanoparticles localized
within the oil has been proposed to be responsible for efficient electron
trapping, leading to decrease in the positive streamer velocity and resulting
in high dielectric breakdown voltage. The differences in the performance of
anatase and rutile has been explained based on the electronic structure of the
two and the affinity towards electron scavenging.

besides modifying the running of the QCD coupling could even lead to the loss
of asymptotic freedom. Such a loss would potentially diminish the Wilsonian
fundamental value of the theory. However, the recent discovery of complete
asymptotically safe vector-like theories \cite{Litim:2014uca}, i.e. featuring
an interacting UV fixed point in all couplings, elevates these theories to a
fundamental status and opens the door to alternative UV completions of (parts
of) the standard model. If, for example, QCD rather than being asymptotically
free becomes asymptotically safe there would be consequences on the early time
evolution of the Universe (the QCD plasma would not be free). It is therefore
important to test, both directly and indirectly, the strong coupling running at
the highest possible energies. I will review here the attempts made in
\cite{Becciolini:2014lya} to use pure QCD observables at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) to place bounds on new colored states. Such bounds do not depend
on the detailed properties of the new hypothetical states but on their
effective number and mass. We will see that these direct constraints cannot
exclude a potentially safe, rather than free, QCD asymptotic nature. A safe QCD
scenario would imply that quarks and gluons are only approximately free at some
intermediate energies, otherwise they are always in chains.

unprecedented capacity enhancement in next-generation wireless networks thanks
to the centralization and virtualization of base station processing. However,
centralized signal processing in C-RANs involves high computational complexity
that quickly becomes unaffordable when the network grows to a huge size. Among
the first, this paper endeavours to design a scalable uplink signal detection
algorithm, in the sense that both the complexity per unit network area and the
total computation time remain constant when the network size grows. To this
end, we formulate the signal detection in C-RAN as an inference problem over a
bipartite random geometric graph. By passing messages among neighboring nodes,
message passing (a.k.a. belief propagation) provides an efficient way to solve
the inference problem over a sparse graph. However, the traditional
message-passing algorithm is not guaranteed to converge, because the
corresponding bipartite random geometric graph is locally dense and contains
many short loops. As a major contribution of this paper, we propose a
randomized Gaussian message passing (RGMP) algorithm to improve the
convergence. Instead of exchanging messages simultaneously or in a fixed order,
we propose to exchange messages asynchronously in a random order. The proposed
RGMP algorithm demonstrates significantly better convergence performance than
conventional message passing. The randomness of the message update schedule
also simplifies the analysis, and allows the derivation of the convergence
conditions for the RGMP algorithm. In addition, we propose a blockwise RGMP
(B-RGMP) algorithm for practical implementation. The average computation time
of B-RGMP remains constant when the network size increases.

prove that $k$-NN is universally consistent if we take a sequence of random

replacing norms with distances based on uniformly locally Lipschitz functions

choosing a distance for $k$-NN based on the labelled sample. We show the

  energy conversion during the linear piezoelectric and piezomagnetic effects
  in section 3. A schematic illustration of the conversion of energies for the
  three coupling effects between electromagnetic fields and elastic fields are
  also summarized in Figure 2 at the end of section 5",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coupling effects among different physical fields substantially reflect the
conversion of energies from one form into another. For simple physical
processes, their governing or constitutive equations all satisfy the law of
conservation of energy. Then, analysis is extended to coupling effects. First,
it is found for the linear direct and converse piezoelectric and piezomagnetic
effects, their constitutive equations guarantee that the total energy is
conserved during the process of energy conversion between the elastic and
electromagnetic fields; however, energies are converted via work terms,
$(\beta_{ijk} E_i )_{,k} v_j$ and $(\gamma_{ijk} H_i)_{,k} v_j$, rather than
via energy terms, $\beta_{ijk} E_i e_{jk}$ and $\gamma_{ijk} H_i e_{jk}$.
Second, for the generalized Villari effects, the electromagnetic energy can be
treated as an extra contribution to the generalized elastic energy. Third, for
electrostriction and magnetostriction, it is argued both effects are induced by
the Maxwell stress; moreover, their energy is purely electromagnetic and thus
both have no converse effects. During these processes, energy can be converted
in three different ways, i.e., via non-potential forces, via cross-dependence
of energy terms and directly via the electromagnetic interactions of ions and
electrons. In the end, general coupling processes which involve elastic,
electromagnetic fields and diffusion are also analyzed. The advantage of using
this energy formulation is that it facilitates discussions of the conversion of

Oliveira","Cosmic Time Transformations in Cosmological Relativity","36 pages, 1 table, 13 figures",,"10.4236/jhepgc.2016.22022",,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The relativity of cosmic time is developed within the framework of
Cosmological Relativity in five dimensions of space, time and velocity. A
general linearized metric element is defined to have the form $ds^2 = (1+\phi)
c^2 dt^2 - dr^2 + (1+\psi) \tau^2 dv^2$, where the coordinates are time $t$,
radial distance $r=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ for spatials $x$, $y$ and $z$, and
velocity $v$, with $c$ the speed of light in vacuum and $\tau$ the
Hubble-Carmeli time constant. The metric is accurate to first order in $t/\tau$
and $v/c$. The fields $\phi$ and $\psi$ are general functions of the
coordinates. By showing that $\phi = \psi$, a metric of the form $ds^2 = c^2
dt^2 - dr^2 + \tau^2 dv^2$ is obtained from the general metric, implying that
the universe is flat. For cosmological redshift $z$, the luminosity distance
relation $D_L (z,t) = r (1 + z) / \sqrt{1 - t^2 / \tau^2}$ is used to fit
combined distance moduli from Type Ia Supernovae up to $z < 1.5$ and Gamma-Ray
Bursts up to $z < 7$, from which a value of $\Omega_M = 0.800 \pm 0.080$ is
obtained for the matter density parameter at the present epoch. Assuming a
baryon density of $\Omega_B = 0.038 \pm 0.004$, a rest mass energy of $( 9.79
\pm 0.47 ) \, {\rm GeV}$ is predicted for the anti-baryonic $\bar{Y}$ and the
$\Phi^{*}$ particles which decay from a hypothetical $\bar{X}_1$ particle. The
cosmic aging function $g_1(z,t)= ( 1 + z) ( 1 - t^2 / \tau^2 )$ makes good fits
to light curve data from two reports of Type 1a supernovae and in fitting to
simulated quasar like light curve power spectra separated by redshift
$\Delta{z} \approx 1$. We determine the multipole of the first acoustic peak of
the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation anisotropy to be $l \approx 224 \pm
5$ and a sound horizon of $\theta_{sh0} \approx (0.805 \pm 0.020 ) {}^{\circ}$
on today's sky.

optimize the performance of several nonlinear-type time-frequency analyses,
including the reassignment method, and the synchrosqueezing transform (SST) and
its variations. A window rendering the most concentrated distribution in the
time-frequency representation (TFR) is regarded as the optimal window. The
TVOWW selection scheme is particularly useful for signals that comprise
fast-varying instantaneous frequencies and small spectral gaps. To demonstrate
the efficacy of the method, in addition to analyzing a synthetic signal, we
study an atomic time-varying dipole moment driven by two-color mid-infrared
laser fields in attosecond physics.
