product of Morava $E$-theory spectra. As a consequence, we generalize results
of Ravenel-Wilson-Yagita and Kashiwabara from spaces to spectra and deduce that
the notion of good group is determined by Brown-Peterson cohomology.
Furthermore, we show that rational factorizations of the Morava $E$-theory of
certain finite groups hold integrally up to bounded torsion with
height-independent exponent, thereby lifting these factorizations to the
rationalized Brown-Peterson cohomology of such groups.

using the full-disk observations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard
the Solar Dynamics Observatory associated with all flares of GOES class M5 or
larger from 01 May 2010 through 31 December 2014. Using a superposed-epoch
analysis, we find an increase in the rate of flares, filament eruptions, and
substantial sprays and surges more than 20 degrees away from the primary flares
within the first four hours at a significance of 1.8 standard deviations. We
also find that the rate of distant events drops by two standard deviations, or
a factor of 1.2, when comparing intervals between 4 hours and 24 hours before
and after the start times of the primary large flares. We discuss the evidence
for the concluding hypothesis that the gradual evolution leading to the large
flare and the impulsive release of the energy in that flare both contribute to
the destabilization of magnetic configurations in distant active regions and
quiet-Sun areas. These effects appear to leave distant regions, in an ensemble
sense, in a more stable state, so that fewer energetic events happen for at
least a day following large energetic events.

incorporation of experimental observations can be used to improve the quality

different errors, especially when a system populates simultaneously an ensemble
of different states and experimental data are measured as averages over such
states. To address this problem we present a Bayesian inference method, called
metainference, that is able to deal with errors in experimental measurements as
well as with experimental measurements averaged over multiple states. To
achieve this goal, metainference models a finite sample of the distribution of
models using a replica approach, in the spirit of the replica-averaging
modelling based on the maximum entropy principle. To illustrate the method we
present its application to a heterogeneous model system and to the
determination of an ensemble of structures corresponding to the thermal
fluctuations of a protein molecule. Metainference thus provides an approach to
model complex systems with heterogeneous components and interconverting between
different states by taking into account all possible sources of errors.

the compensating field of the canonical odd Laplacian depends only on this

scattering of electrons by the host solid and its excitations. The electrical
resistance is set by geometrical factors and the resistivity, which is a
microscopic property of the solid. Hydrodynamic fluid flow through channels, in
contrast, is determined by geometrical factors, boundary scattering and the
viscosity of the fluid, which is governed by momentum-conserving internal
collisions. A long-standing question in the physics of solids, brought into
focus by the advent of new calculational techniques, has been whether the
viscosity of the electron fluid plays an observable role in determining the
resistance. At first sight this seems unlikely, because in almost all known
materials the rate of momentum-relaxing collisions dominates that of the
momentum-conserving ones that give the viscous term. Here, we show this is not
always the case. We report experimental evidence that the resistance of
restricted channels of the ultra-pure two-dimensional metal PdCoO$_2$ has a
large viscous contribution. Comparison with theory allows an estimate of the

graphs, the vertices correspond to the small areas of the gray matter, and two
vertices are connected by an edge, if a diffusion-MRI based workflow finds
connections between those areas. One main question of the field is discovering
the directions of the edges. In a previous work we have reported the
construction of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server
http://connectome.pitgroup.org from the data recorded in the Human Connectome
Project of the NIH. After the server had been published, we recognized a
surprising and unforeseen property of it: The server can generate the
braingraph of connections that are present in at least $k$ graphs out of the
418, for any value of $k=1,2,...,418$. When the value of $k$ is changed from
$k=418$ through 1 by moving a slider at the webserver from right to left, more
and more edges appear in the consensus graph. The astonishing observation is
that the appearance of the new edges is not random: it is similar to a growing
tree. We hypothesize that this movement of the slider in the webserver may copy
the development of the connections in the human brain in the following sense:
the connections that are present in all subjects are the oldest ones, and those
that are present in a decreasing fraction of subjects are gradually the newer
connections in the individual brain development. An animation on the phenomenon
is available at https://youtu.be/EnWwIf_HNjw. Based on this hypothesis, we can
assign directions to the edges of the connectome as follows: Let $G_i$ denote
the consensus connectome where each edge is present in at least $i$ graphs.
Suppose that vertex $v$ is isolated in $G_{k+1}$, and becomes connected to a
vertex $u$ in $G_k$, where $u$ was connected to other vertices already in
$G_{k+1}$. Then we direct this $(v,u)$ edge from $v$ to $u$.

especially prevalent in inverse problems with a sparsity inducing norm and in
general convex optimization with simple constraints. The most widely used
algorithms for convex composite models are accelerated first order methods,
however they can take a large number of iterations to compute an acceptable
solution for large-scale problems. In this paper we propose to speed up first
order methods by taking advantage of the structure present in many applications
and in image processing in particular. Our method is based on multi-level
optimization methods and exploits the fact that many applications that give
rise to large scale models can be modelled using varying degrees of fidelity.
We use Nesterov's acceleration techniques together with the multi-level
approach to achieve $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ convergence rate, where
$\epsilon$ denotes the desired accuracy. The proposed method has a better
convergence rate than any other existing multi-level method for convex
problems, and in addition has the same rate as accelerated methods, which is
known to be optimal for first-order methods. Moreover, as our numerical
experiments show, on large-scale face recognition problems our algorithm is
several times faster than the state of the art.

exchange-coupling a paramagnetic impurity with the spin-1/2 honeycomb Kitaev
model in its gapless spin-liquid phase. The (impurity) scaling equations are
found to be insensitive to the sign of the coupling. The weak and strong
coupling fixed points are stable, with the latter corresponding to a
noninteracting vacancy and an interacting, spin-1 defect for the
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic cases respectively. The ground state in the
strong coupling limit in both cases has a nontrivial topology associated with a
finite Z2 flux at the impurity site. For the antiferromagnetic case, this
result can be obtained straightforwardly owing to the integrability of the
Kitaev model with a vacancy. The strong-coupling limit of the ferromagnetic
case is however nonintegrable, and we address this problem through
exact-diagonalization calculations with finite Kitaev fragments. Our exact
diagonalization calculations indicate that that the weak to strong coupling
transition and the topological phase transition occur rather close to each
other and are possibly coincident. We also find an intriguing similarity

both $\dim A > 1$ and $\dim B > 1$, we prove that the intersections $P_{L}(A)
\cap P_{L}(B)$ have positive length for positively many $L$.
  If $A \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a Borel set with $0 < \mathcal{H}^{s}(A) <
\infty$ for some $s > 1$, it is known that $A$ is 'visible' from almost all
points $x \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$ in the sense that $A$ intersects a positive
fraction of all lines passing through $x$. In fact, a result of Marstrand says
that such non-empty intersections typically have dimension $s - 1$. Our second
main result strengthens this by showing that the set of exceptional points $x
\in \mathbb{R}^{2}$, for which Marstrand's assertion fails, has Hausdorff
dimension at most one.

The fundamental theorem of congruence commutators for loops relates generators

specialize the fundamental theorem into several varieties of loops, and also
discuss the commutator of two normal subloops.
  Consequently, we argue that some standard definitions of loop theory, such as
elementwise commutators and associators, should be revised and linked more
closely to inner mappings. Using the new definitions, we prove several natural
properties of loops that could not be so elegantly stated with the standard

requirements are stochastic trigger and short delay time (< 500 ns) between

energy and power scaling with high efficiency. However the single pass gain is
small (about 1.2). Hence a multi-pass scheme with precise mode matching for
large beam waists (w = 2 mm) is required. Instead of using the standard 4f
design, we have developed a multi-pass amplifier with a beam propagation
insensitive to thermal lens effects and misalignments. The beam propagation is
equivalent to multiple roundtrips in an optically stable resonator. To support
the propagation we used an array of 2 x 8 individually adjustable plane
mirrors. Astigmatism has been minimized by a compact mirror placement. Precise
alignment of the kinematic array was realized using our own mirror mount
design. A small signal gain of 5 for 8 passes at a pump power of 400 W was
reached. The laser was running for more than 3 months without the need of
realignment. Pointing stability studies is also reported here.

under which a quantum system equilibrates rapidly with respect to a concrete
observable. On the one hand previously known general upper bounds on the time
scales of equilibration were unrealistically long, with times scaling linearly
with the dimension of the Hilbert space. These bounds proved to be tight, since
particular constructions of observables scaling in this way were found. On the
other hand, the computed equilibration time scales for certain classes of
typical measurements, or under the evolution of typical Hamiltonians, turn out
to be unrealistically short. However neither classes of results cover
physically relevant situations, which up to now had only been tractable in
specific models. In this paper we provide a new upper bound on the
equilibration time scales which, under some physically reasonable conditions,
give much more realistic results than previously known. In particular, we apply
this result to the paradigmatic case of a system interacting with a thermal
bath, where we obtain an upper bound for the equilibration time scale
independent of the size of the bath. In this way, we find general conditions
that single out observables with realistic equilibration times within a
physically relevant setup.

bounded above and initial data suitably bounded, cosmological-type singularity
theorems are known, as are splitting theorems which determine the geometry of
timelike geodesically complete spacetimes for which the bound on the initial

are able to extend the singularity theorems to finite $N$-values $N\in

design a set of equal-norm vectors with large angular separation. This idea is
essentially equivalent to constructing a frame with low coherence. The elements

quantum measurement operators, and compressive sensing measurement matrices, to
name a few applications.
  In this work, we allude to the group-frame construction first described by
Slepian and further explored in the works of Vale and Waldron. We present a
method for selecting representations of a finite group to construct a group
frame that achieves low coherence. Our technique produces a tight frame with a
small number of distinct inner product values between the frame elements, in a
sense approximating a Grassmanian frame. We identify special cases in which our
construction yields some previously-known frames with optimal coherence meeting
the Welch lower bound, and other cases in which the entries of our frame
vectors come from small alphabets. In particular, we apply our technique to the
problem choosing a subset of rows of a Hadamard matrix so that the resulting
columns form a low-coherence frame. Finally, we give an explicit calculation of
the average coherence of our frames, and find regimes in which they satisfy the

  Partially Labeled Data Sets","preprint version, 9 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction is an important problem in
machine learning and computational biology. However, there is no data set for
training or evaluation purposes, where all the instances are accurately
labeled. Instead, what is available are instances of positive class (with
possibly noisy labels) and no instances of negative class. The non-availability
of negative class data is typically handled with the observation that randomly
chosen protein-pairs have a nearly 100% chance of being negative class, as only
1 in 1,500 protein pairs expected is expected to be an interacting pair. In
this paper, we focused on the problem that non-availability of accurately
labeled testing data sets in the domain of protein-protein interaction (PPI)
prediction may lead to biased evaluation results. We first showed that not
acknowledging the inherent skew in the interactome (i.e. rare occurrence of
positive instances) leads to an over-estimated accuracy of the predictor. Then
we show that, with the belief that positive interactions are a rare category,
sampling random pairs of proteins excluding known interacting proteins set as
the negative testing data set could lead to an under-estimated evaluation
result. We formalized those two problems to validate the above claim, and based
on the formalization, we proposed a balancing method to cancel out the
over-estimation with under-estimation. Finally, our experiments validated the
theoretical aspects and showed that this balancing evaluation could evaluate
the exact performance without availability of golden standard data sets.

efficiency is achieved from exploiting four routes. First, we use numerical
atomic orbital (NAO) techniques to efficiently generate a good quality initial
subspace which is crucially required by Chebyshev filtering methods. Second, we
exploit the fact that only a subspace spanning the occupied Kohn-Sham states is
required, and solving accurately the KS equation using eigensolvers can
generally be avoided. Third, by judiciously analyzing and optimizing various
parts of the procedure in RESCU, we delay the $O(N^3)$ scaling to large $N$,
and our tests show that RESCU scales consistently as $O(N^{2.3})$ from a few
hundred atoms to more than 5,000 atoms when using a real space grid
discretization. The scaling is better or comparable in a NAO basis up to the
14,000 atoms level. Fourth, we exploit various numerical algorithms and, in
particular, we introduce a partial Rayleigh-Ritz algorithm to achieve
efficiency gains for systems comprising more than 10,000 electrons. We
demonstrate the power of RESCU in solving KS-DFT problems using many examples

Telescopes with aperture obstructions, such as secondary mirrors and spider
support structures, require advanced coronagraph designs to provide adequate
starlight suppression. We introduce a phase-only Lyot-plane optic to the vortex
coronagraph that offers improved contrast performance on telescopes with
complicated apertures. Potential solutions for the European Extremely Large

relocates residual starlight away from a region of the image plane thereby
reducing stellar noise and improving sensitivity to off-axis companions. The
phase mask is calculated using an iterative phase retrieval algorithm.
Numerically, we achieve a contrast on the order of $10^{-6}$ for a companion
with angular displacement as small as $4~\lambda/D$ with an E-ELT type
aperture. Even in the presence of aberrations, improved performance is expected
compared to either a conventional vortex coronagraph or optimized pupil plane

outcomes extend to synapses with multiple states and to deeper neural
architectures. The large deviation measure also suggests how to design novel

with rare migration. The use of the exponential transformation, rather than the
usual linear one, is appropriate when interactions have multiplicative fitness
effects, and allows for a tractable characterization of the effect of
assortment on the evolution of cooperation. We define two senses in which a
greater degree of assortment can favour the evolution of cooperation, the first
stronger than the second: (i) greater assortment increases, at all population

the probability that the number of defectors increases; and (ii) greater

doublet that gets no VEV, we readily achieve the dark matter asymmetry through
leptogenesis. The model can simultaneously have three portals to the standard

proximity to host stars such as Kepler-36 and Kepler-11. Several post-formation
processes have been proposed for explaining the origin of the compositional
diversity: the mass loss via stellar XUV irradiation, degassing of accreted
material, and in-situ accumulation of the disk gas. Close-in planets are also
likely to experience giant impacts during the advanced stage of planet
formation. This study examines the possibility of transforming volatile-rich
super-Earths / mini-Neptunes into volatile-depleted super-Earths through giant
impacts. We present the results of three-dimensional giant impact simulations
in the accretionary and disruptive regimes. Target planets are modeled with a
three-layered structure composed of an iron core, silicate mantle and
hydrogen/helium envelope. In the disruptive case, the giant impact can remove
most of the H/He atmosphere immediately and homogenize the refractory material
in the planetary interior. In the accretionary case, the planet can retain more
than half of the gaseous envelope, while a compositional gradient suppresses
efficient heat transfer as its interior undergoes double-diffusive convection.
After the giant impact, a hot and inflated planet cools and contracts slowly.
The extended atmosphere enhances the mass loss via both a Parker wind induced
by thermal pressure and hydrodynamic escape driven by the stellar XUV
irradiation. As a result, the entire gaseous envelope is expected to be lost
due to the combination of those processes in both cases. We propose that
Kepler-36b may have been significantly devolatilized by giant impacts, while a
substantial fraction of Kepler-36c's atmosphere may remain intact. Furthermore,
the stochastic nature of giant impacts may account for the large dispersion in
the mass--radius relationship of close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.

integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. We have conducted Gemini IFU mapping of
the ionized gas nebulae surrounding two AGNs, whose outflow radii have been
constrained by UV absorption line analyses. In Mrk 509, we find a
quasi-spherical outflow with a radius of 1.2 kpc and a velocity of $\sim290$ km
s$^{-1}$, while IRAS F04250$-$5718 is driving a biconical outflow extending out
to 2.9 kpc, with a velocity of $\sim580$ km s$^{-1}$ and an opening angle of
$\sim70^{\circ}$. The derived mass flow rate is $\sim5$ and $>1$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$, respectively, and the kinetic luminosity is $\gtrsim1\times10^{41}$
erg s$^{-1}$ for both. Adopting the outflow radii and geometric parameters
measured from IFU, absorption line analyses would yield mass flow rates and
kinetic luminosities in agreement with the above results within a factor of
$\sim2$. We conclude that the spatial locations, kinematics and energetics
revealed by this IFU emission-line study are consistent with pre-existing UV
absorption line analyses, providing a long-awaited direct confirmation of the
latter as an effective approach for characterizing outflow properties.

such as the rise in the positron fraction above ~10 GeV of energy and the
spectral hardening of protons and helium at ~300 GeV/nucleon of energy. The
ATIC-2 experiment has recently reported an unexpected spectral upturn in the
elemental ratios involving iron, such as the C/Fe or O/Fe ratios, at energy
above 50 GeV per nucleon. It is recognized that the observed positron excess
can be explained by pion production processes during diffusive shock
acceleration of cosmic-ray hadrons in nearby sources. Recently, it was
suggested that a scenario with nearby source dominating the GeV-TeV spectrum
may be connected with the change of slope observed in protons and nuclei, which
would be interpreted as a flux transition between the local component and the
large-scale distribution of Galactic sources. Here I show that, under a
two-component scenario with nearby source, the shape of the spectral transition
is expected to be slightly different for heavy nuclei, such as iron, because
their propagation range is spatially limited by inelastic collisions with the
interstellar matter. This enables a prediction for the primary/primary ratios
between light and heavy nuclei. From this effect, a spectral upturn is
predicted in the C/Fe and O/Fe ratios in good accordance with the ATIC-2 data.

of the Be and B production from collisions of heavier nuclei with the gas.
Using the available cross-section data, I present for the first time an
evaluation of the nuclear uncertainties and their impact in constraining the

constraints on the transport parameters allowing to resolutely break the
degeneracy, while nuclear uncertainties in the models are found to be a major
limiting factor. Once these uncertainties are accounted, the degeneracy remains
poorly resolved. In particular, the Be/B ratio at ~1 - 10 GeV/n is found not to

precise Be/B data at higher energy may be useful to test the nuclear physics

relativistic anomaly inflow mechanism with an appropriately modified anomaly
polynomial, can be used to generate these anomalies. Similar to relativistic
case, we find that Galilean anomalies also survive only in even dimensions.
Further, these anomalies only effect the gauge and rotational symmetries of a
Galilean theory; in particular the Milne boost symmetry remains non-anomalous.
We also extend the transgression machinery used in relativistic fluids to
fluids on null backgrounds, and use it to determine how these anomalies affect
the constitutive relations of a Galilean fluid.
  Unrelated to Galilean fluids, we propose an analogue of the off-shell second
law of thermodynamics for relativistic fluids introduced by [arXiv:1106.0277],

Interestingly, we find that even in absense of spin and torsion the entropy

We found a variety of molecular gas distributions within the HCGs, including
regularly rotating disks, bars, rings, tidal tails, and possibly nuclear
outflows, though the molecular gas morphologies are more consistent with
spirals and early-type galaxies than mergers and interacting systems. Our
CO-imaged HCG galaxies show star formation suppression of
$\langle$S$\rangle$=10$\pm$5, distributed bimodally, with five objects
exhibiting suppressions of S$\gtrsim$10 and depletion timescales
$\gtrsim$10Gyr. This star formation inefficiency is also seen in the efficiency
per freefall time. We investigate the gas-to-dust ratios of these galaxies to
determine if an incorrect conversion caused the apparent suppression and find
that HCGs have normal ratios. It is likely that the cause of the suppression in
these objects is associated with shocks injecting turbulence into the molecular
gas. Galaxies with high star formation suppression (S$\gtrsim$10) also appear
to be those in the most advanced stages of transition across optical and
infrared color space. This supports the idea that some galaxies in HCGs are
transitioning objects, where a disruption of the existing molecular gas in the
system suppresses star formation by inhibiting the molecular gas from
collapsing and forming stars efficiently. These observations, combined with
recent work on poststarburst galaxies with molecular reservoirs, indicates that
galaxies do not need to expel their molecular reservoirs prior to quenching
star formation and transitioning from blue spirals to red early-type galaxies.
This may imply that star formation quenching can occur without the need to
starve a galaxy of cold gas first.

state. Current methods of generating BNS and BHNS waveforms rely on either
computationally challenging full 3D hydrodynamical simulations or approximate
analytic solutions. We introduce a new method for computing inspiral waveforms
for BNS/BHNS systems by adding the post-Newtonian (PN) tidal effects to full
numerical simulations of binary black holes (BBHs), effectively replacing the
nontidal terms in the PN expansion with BBH results. Comparing a waveform
generated with this method against a full hydrodynamical simulation of a BNS

numerical phase accuracy required of BNS simulations to measure the accuracy of

Locally Brightest Galaxies (LBGs). These are selected from the SDSS/DR7
spectroscopic and photometric catalogues to be brighter than any neighbour
projected within 1.0 Mpc and differing in redshift by $<1000$ km/s. Most ($>
83\%$) are expected to be the central galaxies of their dark matter halos.
Previous stacking analyses have used this LBG sample to measure mean
Sunyaev-Zeldovich flux and mean X-ray luminosity as a function of LBG stellar
mass. In both cases, a simulation of the formation of the galaxy population was
used to estimate effective halo mass for LBGs of given stellar mass, allowing
the derivation of scaling relations between the gas properties of halos and
their mass. By comparing results from a variety of simulations to our lensing
data, we show that this procedure has significant model dependence reflecting:
(i) the failure of any given simulation to reproduce observed galaxy abundances
exactly; (ii) a dependence on the cosmology underlying the simulation; and
(iii) a dependence on the details of how galaxies populate halos. We use our
lensing results to recalibrate the scaling relations, eliminating most of this
model dependence and explicitly accounting both for residual modelling
uncertainties and for observational uncertainties in the lensing results. The
resulting scaling relations link the mean gas properties of dark halos to their
mass over an unprecedentedly wide range, $10^{12.5}<M_{500}/
\mathrm{M_\odot}<10^{14.5}$, and should fairly and robustly represent the full
halo population.

buffering against unexpected events, with particular applications to the
control of energy systems in a stochastic and typically time-heterogeneous
environment. Our philosophy is that of viewing the problem as being formally
one of stochastic dynamic programming, but of using coupling arguments to
provide good estimates of the costs of failing to provide necessary levels of
buffering. The problem of control then reduces to that of the solution,
dynamically in time, of a deterministic optimisation problem which must be
periodically re-solved. We show that the optimal control then proceeds locally
in time, in the sense that the optimal decision at each time $t$ depends only
on a knowledge of the future costs and stochastic evolution of the system for a
time horizon which typically extends only a little way beyond $t$. The approach
is thus both computationally tractable and suitable for the management of
systems over indefinitely extended periods of time. We develop also the
associated strong Lagrangian theory (which may be used to assist in the optimal
dimensioning of storage), and we provide characterisations of optimal control
policies. We give examples based on Great Britain electricity price data.

finite-size effects for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions do not
require surface fields necessarily but are implemented nontrivially from the
Feynman rules involving only bulk terms in the Lagrangian. As an application,
the critical exponents $\eta$ and $\nu$ are evaluated at least up to two-loop

mono-abundance populations (MAPs)---stars in narrow bins in [a/Fe] and
[Fe/H]---accounting for the complex effects of the APOGEE selection function
and the spatially-variable dust obscuration. We determine that all MAPs with
enhanced [a/Fe] are centrally concentrated and are well-described as
exponentials with a scale length of 2.2+/-0.2 kpc over the whole radial range
of the disk. We discover that the surface-density profiles of low-[a/Fe] MAPs
are complex: they do not monotonically decrease outwards, but rather display a
peak radius ranging from ~5 kpc to ~13 kpc at low [Fe/H]. The extensive radial
coverage of the data allows us to measure radial trends in the thickness of
each MAP. While high-[a/Fe] MAPs have constant scale heights, low-[a/Fe] MAPs
flare. We confirm, now with high-precision abundances, previous results that
each MAP contains only a single vertical scale height and that low-[Fe/H],
low-[a/Fe] and high-[Fe/H], high-[a/Fe] MAPs have intermediate (h_Z~300 to 600
pc) scale heights that smoothly bridge the traditional thin- and thick-disk
divide. That the high-[a/Fe], thick disk components do not flare is strong
evidence against their thickness being caused by radial migration. The
correspondence between the radial structure and chemical-enrichment age of
stellar populations is clear confirmation of the inside-out growth of galactic
disks. The details of these relations will constrain the variety of physical

the behavior of the resonances for different confinement geometries are

host a strong, large scale magnetic field. Both, the origin and the
evolutionary consequences of these fields are largely unknown. We argue that
these fields may be sufficiently strong in the deep interior of the stars to
suppress convection near the outer edge of their convective core. We performed
parametrised stellar evolution calculations and assumed a reduced size of the
convective core for stars in the mass range 16 M$_{\odot}$ to 28 M$_{\odot}$
from the zero age main sequence until core carbon depletion. We find that such
models avoid the coolest part of the main sequence band, which is usually
filled by evolutionary models that include convective core overshooting.
Furthermore, our `magnetic' models populate the blue supergiant region during
core helium burning, i.e., the post-main sequence gap left by ordinary single
star models, and some of them end their life in a position near that of the
progenitor of Supernova 1987A in the HR diagram. Further effects include a
strongly reduced luminosity during the red supergiant stage, and downward shift
of the limiting initial mass for white dwarf and neutron star formation.

error variances into fitting parameters of misspecified models. Our asymptotic
theory focuses on the particular case of linear regression where often weighted

that when the response is a non-linear function of the independent variable,
the standard procedure of weighting by the inverse of the observation variances

literature and claimed to be successful candidates to explain dark energy.
Several instantiations of this simple idea have been considered, the most
promising of which are reviewed here. Nevertheless, results previously attained
heavily relied on the perturbative approach to the analysis of the effective
Yang-Mills action, which is only adequate in the asymptotically-free limit, and
were extended into a regime, the infrared limit, in which confinement is
expected. We show that if a minimum of the effective Lagrangian in $\theta
\!=\! - F_{\, \, \mu \nu}^a \, F^{a \mu \nu}/2$ exists, a YMC forms that drives
the Universe toward an accelerated de Sitter phase. The details of the models
depend weakly on the specific form of the effective Yang-Mills Lagrangian.
Using non-perturbative techniques mutated from the functional renormalization
group procedure, we finally show that the minimum in $\theta$ of the effective
Lagrangian exists, thus YMC can actually take place. The non-perturbative model
has properties similar to the ones of the perturbative model. In the early
stage of the universe, the YMC equation of state has an evolution that
resembles the radiation component, i.e. $w_y \rightarrow 1/3$. However, in the
late stage, $w_y$ naturally runs to the critical state with $w_y =-1$, and the
universe transits from matter-dominated into dark energy dominated stage only

position and force measurements obtained during mechanical palpation for
registration and stiffness mapping. Prior approaches, including our own,
exhaustively palpated the entire organ to achieve this goal. To overcome the
costly palpation of the entire organ, a Bayesian optimization framework is
introduced to guide the end effector to palpate stiff regions while
simultaneously updating the registration of the end effector to an a priori
geometric model of the organ, hence enabling the fusion of ntraoperative data
into the a priori model obtained through imaging. This new framework uses
Gaussian processes to model the stiffness distribution and Bayesian
optimization to direct where to sample next for maximum information gain. The
proposed method was evaluated with experimental data obtained using a Cartesian
robot interacting with a silicone organ model and an ex vivo porcine liver.

consists of five epochs of quasi-simultaneous optical and near-infrared
spectroscopy spanning a period of about five years and three epochs of X-ray
spectroscopy overlapping in time with it. Whereas the broad emission lines and
hot dust emission varied only moderately, the coronal lines varied strongly.
However, the observed high variability is mainly due to a flux decrease. Using
the optical [FeVII] and X-ray OVII emission lines we estimate that the coronal
line gas has a relatively low density of n~10^3/cm^3 and a relatively high
ionisation parameter of log U~1. The resultant distance of the coronal line gas
from the ionising source of about eight light years places this region well
beyond the hot inner face of the dusty torus. These results imply that the
coronal line region is an independent entity. We find again support for the
X-ray heated wind scenario of Pier & Voit; the increased ionising radiation
that heats the dusty torus also increases the cooling efficiency of the coronal
line gas, most likely due to a stronger adiabatic expansion. The much stronger
coronal line variability of NGC 5548 relative to that of NGC 4151 can also be
explained within this picture. NGC 5548 has much stronger coronal lines
relative to the low ionisation lines than NGC 4151 indicating a stronger wind,
in which case a stronger adiabatic expansion of the gas and so fading of the
line emission is expected.

sporadically. From the nature of the variation of accretion rate ratio
(ARR=$\dot{m_h}$ / $\dot{m_d}$) and QPOs, entire period of the outburst is
classified in two spectral states, such as, hard (HS), hard-intermediate

soft-intermediate (SIMS) spectral states are observed during entire phase of

additional physical input is required in order to determine how they act on

for studying interpersonal interactions. It has been suggested that a virtual
partner able to play the game with human subjects can be an effective tool to
affect the underlying neural processes needed to establish the necessary
connections between the players, and also to provide new clinical interventions
for the rehabilitation of patients suffering from social disorders. Inspired by
the motor processes of the central nervous system (CNS) and the musculoskeletal
system in the human body, in this paper we develop a novel interactive
cognitive architecture based on nonlinear control theory to drive a virtual
player (VP) to play the mirror game with a human player (HP) in different
configurations. Specifically, we consider two cases: the former where the VP
acts as leader and the latter where it acts as follower. The crucial problem is
to design a feedback control architecture capable of imitating and following or
leading a human player (HP) in a joint action task. Movement of the
end-effector of the VP is modeled by means of a feedback controlled
Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) oscillator, which is coupled with the observed motion of
the HP measured in real time. To this aim, two types of control algorithms
(adaptive control and optimal control) are used and implemented on the HKB
model so that the VP can generate human-like motion while satisfying certain
kinematic constraints. A proof of convergence of the control algorithms is
presented in the paper together with an extensive numerical and experimental
validation of their effectiveness. A comparison with other existing designs is
also discussed, showing the flexibility and the advantages of our control-based
approach.

The results demonstrate that the nearside and awayside ridges extend to
$\Delta\eta \sim \pm 5$ and that the $v_2$ of muons, obtained from subtracting
the correlation functions in high- and low-multiplicity events, is $(16\pm6)\%$
higher in the Pb-going than in the p-going direction. The results are compared

This paper addresses the role of oil compared to the other three main energy
commodities -coal, gas and electricity, in shaping the international trading
network (ITW or WTW, world trade web) in the light of network theory. It
initially surveys briefly the literature on the correlation between oil prices
with economic growth and compares the concepts of time correlation with the
concept of spatial correlation brought about by network theory. It outlines the
conceptual framework underpinning the network measures adopted in the analysis
and results are presented. Three measures are taken into account: the ratio of
mutual exchanges in the network (reciprocity); the role of distances in
determining trades (spatial filling); and the spatial correlation of energy
commodities with the whole trade network and with four trading categories:
food, capital goods, intermediate goods and consumption goods. The analysis
deliver five main results:1) the the energy commodities network was
structurally stable amid dramatic growth during the decade considered; 2) that
oil is the most correlated energy commodity to the world trade web; 3) that oil
is the most pervasive network, though coal is the less affected by distances;
4) that oil has a remarkably high level of internal reciprocity and external
overlapping 5) that the reciprocity of the trade network is negative correlated
in time with the price of oil.

concentration polarization (ICP) or gradients. At sufficiently large currents,
simultaneous measurements of voltage drop and flow field reveal several
distinct dynamic regimes. Initially, the electrodialysis system displays a
steady Ohmic voltage difference ($\Delta V_{ohm}$), followed by a constant
voltage jump ($\Delta V_c$). Immediately after this voltage increase,
micro-vortices set in and grow both in size and speed with time. After this
growth, the resultant voltage levels off around a fixed value. The average
vortex size and speed stabilize as well, while the individual vortices become
unsteady and dynamic. These quantitative results reveal that micro-vortices set

that polarization control provides a versatile tuning knob for tailoring

most important concepts used in physics, chemistry and biology. Suppose we put
the system initially in one of the less probable state then the system will
find the most probable state by a random search among all possible energy
distributions and thus can take long time depending on the size of the system.
In the following, simple analysis using our simple model shows that a small and
physically reasonable energy bias against locally unfavorable energy
distribution, of the order of a few $kT$, can reduce the time-scale of the
process by a significant size.

relies on the availability of solutions for nonlinear structural problems. One
of these solutions is given and experimentally validated in the present article
for a compliant mechanism moving along a smooth curved profile. In particular,
a deformable elastic rod is held by two clamps, one at each end. The first
clamp is constrained to slide without friction along a curved profile, while
the second clamp moves in a straight line transmitting its motion through the
elastic rod to the first clamp. For this system it is shown that the clamp
sliding on the profile imposes nontrivial boundary conditions (derived via a
variational and an asymptotic approach), which strongly influence buckling and
nonlinear structural behaviour. Investigation of this behaviour shows that a
compliant mechanism can be designed, which gives an almost neutral response in
compression. This behavior could easily be exploited to make a force limiting
device. Finally a proof-of-concept device was constructed and tested showing
that the analyzed mechanical system can be realized in practice and it behaves
tightly to the model, so that it can now be used in the design of machines that
use compliant mechanisms.

traditional rigid arm balance) is theoretically introduced and experimentally
validated. The idea is not intuitive, but is the result of nonlinear
equilibrium kinematics of rods inducing configurational forces, so that
deflection of the arms becomes necessary for the equilibrium, which would be
impossible for a rigid system. In particular, the rigid arms of usual scales
are replaced by a flexible elastic lamina, free of sliding in a frictionless
and inclined sliding sleeve, which can reach a unique equilibrium configuration
when two vertical dead loads are applied. Prototypes realized to demonstrate
the feasibility of the system show a high accuracy in the measure of load
within a certain range of use. It is finally shown that the presented results
are strongly related to snaking of confined beams, with implications on
locomotion of serpents, plumbing, and smart oil drilling.

equation. This master equation is formed from the system of superconducting

dispersive reservoir. An analytical approach for searching of some physical
phenomena on the qubit system is presented, such as qubit inversion, purity and
negativity. In addition, these phenomena are discussed for the resonance and
off-resonance cases for many different initial states. From computational
results, it is found that the mentioned phenomena depend on the dispersive
reservoir parameter which leads to their death. However, the complete
destruction of system coherence in the presence of dispersive reservoir leads
to the death of entanglement between the qubit and torsional resonator.

and updated fits to the Cas A fast cooling data. Our model is built on the
assumption that the transient behaviour of the star in Cas A is due to a phase
transition within the dense QCD matter in the core of the star. Specifically,
the fast cooling is attributed to an enhancement in the neutrino emission
triggered by a transition from a fully gapped, two-flavor, red-green
color-superconducting quark condensate to a superconducting crystalline or an
alternative gapless, color-superconducting phase. The blue colored condensate
is modeled as a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type color superconductor with
spin-one pairing order parameter. We study the sensitivity of the fits to the
phase transition temperature, the pairing gap of blue quarks and the time-scale
characterizing the phase transition (the latter modelled in terms of a width
parameter). Relative variations in these parameter around their best fit values
larger than $10^{-3}$ spoil the fit to the data. We confirm the previous
finding that the cooling curves show significant variations as a function of
compact star mass, which allows one to account for dispersion in the data on
the surface temperatures of thermally emitting neutron stars.

considering six cases. Results are noted against different learning rates

been introduced. It is observed that the number of epochs drastically reduced
and performance increased compared to MLP. The average and minimum gain has
been found to be 93% and 75% respectively. The best gain is found to be 95% and
is obtained by setting the learning rate to 0.55.

regional disease and 17% when tumors have metastasized, that is, spread to
distant sites. Furthermore, the incidence of melanoma has been rising by about
3% per year, whereas the incidence of cancers that are more common is
decreasing. A handful of targeted therapies have recently become available that
have finally shown real promise for treatment, but for reasons that remain
unclear only a fraction of patients respond long term. These drugs often
increase survival by only a few months in metastatic patient groups before
relapse occurs. More effective treatment may be possible if a diagnosis can be
made when the tumor burden is still low. Here, an overview of the current
state-of-the-art is provided along with an argument for newer technologies
towards early point-of-care diagnosis of melanoma.
