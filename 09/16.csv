extensively reported in the literature where an entire image is retrieved or
classified. In contrast, in medical imaging, not all parts of the image may be
equally significant or relevant to the image retrieval application at hand. For
instance, in lung x-ray image, the lung region may contain a tumour, hence
being highly significant whereas the surrounding area does not contain
significant information from medical diagnosis perspective. In this paper, we
propose to detect salient regions of images during training and fold the data
to reduce the effect of irrelevant regions. As a result, smaller image areas
will be used for LBP features calculation and consequently classification by
SVM. We use IRMA 2009 dataset with 14,410 x-ray images to verify the

saliency-based folding approach that delivers comparable classification
accuracies with state-of-the-art but exhibits lower computational cost and

or more planets orbiting a primary star with a wide binary stellar companion.
Gravitational forcing of a single planet by a sufficiently inclined binary
orbit can induce large amplitude oscillations of the planet's eccentricity and
inclination through the Kozai-Lidov (KL) instability. KL cycling was invoked to
explain: the large eccentricities of planetary orbits; the family of close--in
hot Jupiters; and the retrograde planetary orbits in eccentric binary systems.
However, several kinds of perturbations can quench the KL instability, by
inducing fast periapse precessions which stabilize circular orbits of all
inclinations: these could be a Jupiter--mass planet, a massive remnant disc or
general relativistic precession. Indeed, mutual gravitational perturbations in
multiplanet S--type systems can be strong enough to lend a certain dynamical
rigidity to their orbital planes. Here we present a new and faster process that
is driven by this very agent inhibiting KL cycling. Planetary perturbations
enable secular oscillations of planetary eccentricities and inclinations, also
called Laplace--Lagrange (LL) eigenmodes. Interactions with a remnant disc of
planetesimals can make planets migrate, causing a drift of LL mode periods
which can bring one or more LL modes into resonance with binary orbital motion.
The results can be dramatic, ranging from excitation of large eccentricities
and mutual inclinations to total disruption. Not requiring special physical or
initial conditions, binary resonant driving is generic and could have
profoundly altered the architecture of many S--type multiplanet systems. It can
also weaken the multiplanet occurrence rate in wide binaries, and affect planet
formation in close binaries.

of secure and insecure measurements to greatly expand the scope of common

attacks, it is shown that with jamming, the optimal attack is given by the
minimum feasible cut in a specific weighted graph. More importantly, for

honeycomb structure of silicene and germanene while simultaneously preserve the
Dirac states: in addition to have a strong binding energy to the monolayer, a
suitable substrate should be a large-gap semiconductor with a proper
workfunction such that the Dirac point lies in the gap and far from the
substrate states when their bands align. We illustrate our idea by performing
first-principles calculations for silicene and germanene on the Al-terminated
(0001) surface of Al2O3 . The overlaid monolayers on Al-terminated Al2O3(0001)
retain the main structural profile of the low-buckled honeycomb structure via a
binding energy comparable to the one between silicene and Ag(111). Unfolded
band structure derived from the k-projection method reveals that gapped Dirac
cone is formed at the K point due to the structural distortion and the
interaction with the substrate. The gaps of 0.4 eV and 0.3 eV respectively for
the supported silicene and germanene suggest that they may have potential
applications in nanoelectronics.

the limit of weak coupling, we analyze the time evolution of the DF in the
vicinity of the QCP (chosen to be at $t=0$) and define three quantities,
namely, the generalized fidelity susceptibility $\chi_F(\tau)$ (defined right
at the QCP), and the decay constants $\alpha_1 (\tau)$ and $\alpha_2 (\tau)$
which dictate the decay of the DF at a small but finite $t$($>0$). Using a
dimensional analysis argument based on the Kibble-Zurek healing length, we show
that $\chi_F(\tau)$ as well as $\alpha_1 (\tau)$ and $\alpha_2(\tau)$ indeed
satisfy universal power-law scaling relations with $\tau$ and the exponents are
solely determined by the spatial dimensionality of the ESS and the exponents
associated with its QCP. Remarkably, using the numerical t-DMRG method, these
scaling relations are shown to be valid in both the situations when the ESS is
integrable and non-integrable and also for both linear and non-linear variation
of the parameter. Furthermore, when an integrable ESS is quenched far away from

behavior results from the difference in the size of the Schottky barriers
between drain and source metal contacts. Each barrier can be modeled as a
Schottky diode but with opposite senses of current rectification between them,
with the diode response resulting from the light induced promotion of
photo-generated carriers across the smaller barrier. The back gate voltage
controls the sense of current rectification by modulating the relative
amplitude between them. This effect, which gives rise to a novel type of
optoelectronic switch, also yields a photovoltaic response. Hence, it could
provide an alternative to PN-junctions when harvesting photovoltaic currents
from transition metal dichalcogenides. We argue that the photovoltaic
efficiency associated to this effect could be increased by just increasing the
relative asymmetry between both Schottky barriers. We also suggest that this

open heavy-flavor production in minimum bias Au$+$Au collisions at

of charm and bottom hadrons. Previous heavy-flavor electron measurements
indicated substantial modification in the momentum distribution of the parent
heavy quarks due to the quark-gluon plasma created in these collisions. For the
first time, using the PHENIX silicon vertex detector to measure precision
displaced tracking, the relative contributions from charm and bottom hadrons to
these electrons as a function of transverse momentum are measured in Au$+$Au
collisions. We compare the fraction of electrons from bottom hadrons to
previously published results extracted from electron-hadron correlations in
$p$$+$$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV and find the fractions to be
similar within the large uncertainties on both measurements for $p_T>4$
GeV/$c$. We use the bottom electron fractions in Au$+$Au and $p$$+$$p$ along
with the previously measured heavy flavor electron $R_{AA}$ to calculate the
$R_{AA}$ for electrons from charm and bottom hadron decays separately. We find
that electrons from bottom hadron decays are less suppressed than those from
charm for the region $3<p_T<4$ GeV/$c$.

unclear because MCs are usually assumed to live longer than the turbulence
dissipation time. Interstellar medium (ISM) turbulence is likely driven by SN
explosions, but it has never been demonstrated that SN explosions can establish
and maintain a turbulent cascade inside MCs consistent with the observations.
In this work, we carry out a simulation of SN-driven turbulence in a volume of
(250 pc)$^3$, specifically designed to test if SN driving alone can be
responsible for the observed turbulence inside MCs. We find that SN driving
establishes a velocity scaling consistent with the usual scaling laws of
supersonic turbulence, suggesting that previous idealized simulations of MC
turbulence, driven with a random, large-scale volume force, were correctly
adopted as appropriate models for MC turbulence, despite the artificial
driving. We also find that the same scaling laws extend to the interior of MCs,
and that the velocity-size relation of the MCs selected from our simulation is
consistent with that of MCs from the Outer-Galaxy Survey, the largest MC sample
available. The mass-size relation and the mass and size probability
distributions also compare successfully with those of the Outer Galaxy Survey.
Finally, we show that MC turbulence is super-Alfv\'{e}nic with respect to both
the mean and rms magnetic-field strength. We conclude that MC structure and
dynamics are the natural result of SN-driven turbulence.

detection of the object of interest for feature calculation, a task that is
highly application-dependent. In this paper, a new version of EFIS is proposed
to overcome these limitations. The new EFIS, called self-configuring EFIS
(SC-EFIS), uses available training data to auto-configure the parameters that

general relativity. Exact wormhole solutions are presented with such sources of
gravity as a massless scalar field, a cosmological constant, and a scalar field
with an exponential potential. However, none of these solutions are
asymptotically flat, which excludes the existence of wormhole entrances as
local objects in our Universe. To overcome this difficulty, we try to build
configurations with flat asymptotic regions using the cut-and-paste procedure:
on both sides of the throat, a wormhole solution is matched to a properly
chosen region of flat space-time at some surfaces $\Sigma_-$ and $\Sigma_+$. It
is shown, however, that if the source of gravity in the throat region is a
scalar field with an arbitrary potential, then one or both thin shells
appearing on $\Sigma_-$ and $\Sigma_+$ inevitably violate the null energy
condition. Thus, although rotating wormhole solutions are easily found without
exotic matter, such matter is still necessary for obtaining asymptotic
flatness.

initial state in the eigenspectrum of the final Hamiltonian, i.e., by the
distribution of overlaps in the energy spectrum. We present an analysis of such
overlap distributions for quenches of the anisotropy parameter in the
one-dimensional anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model (XXZ chain). We provide
an overview of the form of the overlap distribution for quenches from various
initial anisotropies to various final ones, using numerical exact
diagonalization. We show that if the system is prepared in the
antiferromagnetic N\'eel state (infinite anisotropy) and released into a
non-interacting setup (zero anisotropy, XX point) only a small fraction of the
final eigenstates gives contributions to the post-quench dynamics, and that
these eigenstates have identical overlap magnitudes. We derive expressions for
the overlaps, and present the selection rules that determine the final
eigenstates having nonzero overlap. We use these results to derive concise
expressions for time-dependent quantities (Loschmidt echo, longitudinal and
transverse correlators) after the quench. We use perturbative analyses to
understand the overlap distribution for quenches from infinite to small nonzero
anisotropies, and for quenches from large to zero anisotropy.

within the PHENIX detector acceptance over a wide range of mass ($m_{ee} <$ 5
GeV/$c^2$) and pair transverse momentum ($p_T$ $<$ 5 GeV/$c$), for minimum bias
and for five centrality classes. The \ee yield is compared to the expectations
from known sources. In the low-mass region ($m_{ee}=0.30$--0.76 GeV/$c^2$)
there is an enhancement that increases with centrality and is distributed over
the entire pair \pt range measured. It is significantly smaller than previously
reported by the PHENIX experiment and amounts to $2.3\pm0.4({\rm
stat})\pm0.4({\rm syst})\pm0.2^{\rm model}$ or to $1.7\pm0.3({\rm
stat})\pm0.3({\rm syst})\pm0.2^{\rm model}$ for minimum bias collisions when
the open-heavy-flavor contribution is calculated with {\sc pythia} or {\sc
mc@nlo}, respectively. The inclusive mass and $p_T$ distributions as well as
the centrality dependence are well reproduced by model calculations where the
enhancement mainly originates from the melting of the $\rho$ meson resonance as
the system approaches chiral symmetry restoration. In the intermediate-mass
region ($m_{ee}$ = 1.2--2.8 GeV/$c^2$), the data hint at a significant
contribution in addition to the yield from the semileptonic decays of
heavy-flavor mesons.

Consequently, the direction of this paper is towards the investigation of the
impact of hardware impairments on MIMO relay networks with large number of
antennas. Specifically, we obtain the general expression for the ergodic
capacity of dual-hop (DH) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay systems. Next, given

the C18O (2-1) and SO (5_6-4_5) lines at a resolution of ~0.3"" toward the Class
0 protostar B335. The 1.3 mm continuum, C18O, and SO emission all show central
compact components with sizes of ~40-180 AU within more extended components.
The C18O component shows signs of infalling and rotational motion. By fitting
simple kinematic models to the C18O data, the protostellar mass is estimated to
be 0.05 Msun. The specific angular momentum, on a 100 AU scale, is ~4.3E-5
km/s*pc. A similar specific angular momentum, ~3E-5 to 5E-5 km/s*pc, is
measured on a 10 AU scale from the velocity gradient observed in the central SO
component, and there is no clear sign of an infalling motion in the SO
emission. By comparing the infalling and rotational motion, our ALMA results
suggest that the observed rotational motion has not yet reached Keplerian
velocity neither on a 100 AU nor even on a 10 AU scale. Consequently, the
radius of the Keplerian disk in B335 (if present) is expected to be 1-3 AU. The
expected disk radius in B335 is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than
those of observed Keplerian disks around other Class 0 protostars. Based on the
observed infalling and rotational motion from 0.1 pc to inner 100 AU scales,
there are two possible scenarios to explain the presence of such a small
Keplerian disk in B335: magnetic braking and young age. If our finding is the
consequence of magnetic braking, ~50% of the angular momentum of the infalling
material within a 1000 AU scale might have been removed, and the magnetic field
strength on a 1000 AU scale is estimated to be ~200 uG. If it is young age, the

density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Combining BVM with Monte-Carlo
simulations and a DFT-based cluster expansion model, bond-length distributions
and bond-angle variations are predicted. The correlation between bond valence
and bond stiffness is also revealed. Finally the concept of bond valence is
extended into the modelling of an atomistic potential.

of solutions was reduced to approximation of a primitive of the potential by a
finite linear combination of certain specially constructed functions obtained
from the generalized wave polynomials introduced in arXiv:1208.5984 and

the system of functions involved are of primary interest. In arXiv:1306.2914
two basic properties were established: the completeness in appropriate
functional spaces and the linear independence. In this paper we present a
considerably more complete study of the systems of functions. We establish
their relation with another linear differential second-order equation, find out
certain operations (in a sense, generalized derivatives and antiderivatives)

obtain the uniqueness of the coefficients of expansions in terms of such
functions and a corresponding generalized Taylor theorem. We construct the
invertible integral operators transforming powers of the independent variable
into the functions under consideration and establish their commutation
relations with differential operators. We present some error bounds for the
solution of the approximation problem depending on the smoothness of the

We find that using 40 time steps linearly spaced since $z_i \sim 20$, and a
force mesh resolution three times finer than that of the number of particles,
yields a matter power spectrum within $1\%$ for $k \lesssim 1\,h {\rm

turn the halo bias is accurate within $2\%$ for $k \lesssim 0.7\,h {\rm

within $4\%$ for $k \lesssim 0.4\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. These results hold for a
broad range in redshift ($0 < z < 1$) and for all halo mass bins investigated

to one percent level we study various methods that re-calibrate halo masses

assigns a filtered chain complex over Z/2 to a link diagram such that (1) the
E_2 page of the resulting spectral sequence is naturally isomorphic to the
Khovanov homology of the link; (2) this filtered complex behaves nicely under
planar isotopy, disjoint union, and 1-handle addition; and (3) the spectral
sequence collapses at the E_2 page for any diagram of the unlink. We prove that
a Khovanov-Floer theory naturally yields a functor from the link cobordism
category to the category of spectral sequences. In particular, every page
(after E_1) of the spectral sequence accompanying a Khovanov-Floer theory is a
link invariant, and an oriented cobordism in R^3 \times [0,1] between links in
R^3 induces a map between each page of their spectral sequences, invariant up
to smooth isotopy of the cobordism rel boundary.
  We then show that the spectral sequences relating Khovanov homology to
Heegaard Floer homology and singular instanton knot homology are induced by
Khovanov-Floer theories and are therefore functorial in the manner described
above, as has been conjectured for some time. We further show that Szabo's
geometric spectral sequence comes from a Khovanov-Floer theory, and is thus
functorial as well. In addition, we illustrate how our framework can be used to
give another proof that Lee's spectral sequence is functorial and that
Rasmussen's invariant is a knot invariant. Finally, we use this machinery to
define some potentially new knot invariants.

the reservoir. The large number of well rates for each control step make the
optimization problem more difficult and at a high risk of achieving a
suboptimal solution. Moreover, the optimal number of adjustments is not known a
priori. Adjusting well controls too frequently will increase unnecessary well
management and operation cost, and an excessively low number of control
adjustments may not be enough to obtain a good yield. We investigate three
derivative-free optimization algorithms, chosen for their robust and parallel
nature, to determine optimal well control strategies. The algorithms chosen
include generalized pattern search (GPS), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and
covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). These three
algorithms encompass the breadth of available black-box optimization
strategies: deterministic local search, stochastic global search and stochastic
local search. In addition, we hybridize the three derivative-free algorithms
with a multiscale regularization approach. Starting with a reasonably small
number of control steps, the control intervals are subsequently refined during
the optimization. Results for experiments studied indicate that CMA-ES performs
best among the three algorithms in solving both small and large scale problems.
When hybridized with a multiscale regularization approach, the ability to find
the optimal solution is further enhanced, with the performance of GPS improving
the most. Topics affecting the performance of the multiscale approach are
discussed in this paper, including the effect of control frequency on the well

Starting from random initial conditions we compute the maximal Lyapunov

indicate that $\lambda_{max}$ remains constant and positive for $\alpha/d>1$

$N^{-\kappa}$ for $0 \le \alpha/d < 1$ (thus approaching weak chaos and opening
the possibility of breakdown of ergodicity). The suitably rescaled exponent
$\kappa$ exhibits universal scaling, namely that $(d+2) \kappa$ depends only on
$\alpha/d$ and, when $\alpha/d$ increases from zero to unity, it monotonically
decreases from unity to zero, remaining so for all $\alpha/d >1$. The value
$\alpha/d=1$ can therefore be seen as a critical point separating the ergodic
regime from the anomalous one, $\kappa$ playing a role analogous to that of an
order parameter. This scaling law is consistent with Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics

systems. In our setting, receivers, in addition to transmitters, rely solely on
energy harvested from nature, and need to spend some energy in order to decode
their intended packets. We model the decoding energy as an increasing convex
function of the rate of the incoming data. In this setting, in addition to the
traditional energy causality constraints at the transmitters, we have the
decoding causality constraints at the receivers, where energy spent by the
receiver for decoding cannot exceed its harvested energy. We first consider the
point-to-point single-user problem where the goal is to maximize the total
throughput by a given deadline subject to both energy and decoding causality
constraints. We show that decoding costs at the receiver can be represented as
generalized data arrivals at the transmitter, and thereby moving all system
constraints to the transmitter side. Then, we consider several multi-user
settings. We start with a two-hop network where the relay and the destination
have decoding costs, and show that separable policies, where the transmitter's
throughput is maximized irrespective of the relay's transmission energy
profile, are optimal. Next, we consider the multiple access channel (MAC) and
the broadcast channel (BC) where the transmitters and the receivers harvest
energy from nature, and characterize the maximum departure region. In all

10^{-5}$ of the Eddington rate, so radiative cooling by electrons can be
neglected. It can be extended to higher accretion rates in the future by
including electron cooling and proton-electron Coulomb collisions. We present a
suite of tests showing that our method recovers the correct solution for
electron heating under a range of circumstances, including strong shocks and
driven turbulence. Our initial applications to axisymmetric simulations of

yield electron temperature distributions significantly different from the

based on the inversion of a molecular hydrogen based star formation law,

1) there is an increasing trend between the inferred cold gas (HI and H2), HI,

Msun already in place at z = 3; 2) the molecular fractions of cold gas increase
with increasing stellar mass and look-back time; 3) there is hardly any
evolution in the mean HI content of galaxies at fixed stellar mass; 4) the cold
gas fraction and relative amount of molecular hydrogen in galaxies decrease at
a relatively constant rate with time, independent of stellar mass; 5) there is
a large population of low-stellar mass galaxies dominated by atomic gas. These
galaxies are very gas rich, but only a minor fraction of their gas is
molecular; 6) the ratio between star-formation rate (SFR) and inferred total
cold gas mass (HI + H2) of galaxies (i.e., star-formation efficiency; SFE)
increases with star-formation at fixed stellar masses. Due to its simplicity,
the presented approach is valuable to assess the impact of selection biases on

the optimized 3D structure to either $C2/m$ or $Cmc2_1$ within 0.1 meV per

close in energy. The interlayer spin exchange coupling is a few percent of

material. While silica is an excellent glass-former with small $R_c<10^{-2}$
K/s, pure metals and most alloys are poor glass-formers with large

simulations have shown that hard-sphere models are able to identify the atomic

rates more than 13 orders of magnitude smaller than those for pure metals.
However, there are many other features of interatomic potentials beyond

variations in the softness and non-additivity of the repulsive core and form of
the interatomic pair potential at intermediate distances affect the GFA of
binary alloys. These variations in the interatomic pair potential allow us to
introduce geometric frustration and change the crystal phases that compete with
glass formation. We also investigate the effect of tuning the strength of the
many-body interactions from zero to the full embedded atom model on the GFA for
pure metals. We then employ the full embedded atom model for binary BMGs and
show that hard-core interactions play the dominant role in setting the GFA of
alloys, while other features of the interatomic potential only change the GFA

subtraction methods which use the observation that the near-side correlation
signal is negligible for large separations between the associated particle and
the trigger. The combinatorial background is fit in this background-dominated
region. Including the reaction plane dependence of the raw correlation improves
these results. To test the accuracy of these methods, a simple model is used to
simulate di-hadron and jet-hadron correlations with a combinatorial background
similar to that observed in the data. The true signal is compared to the

the matrix of vertices' latent features. This approach is called matrix
factorization and is successfully used in the link prediction problem. To
create a generative model of scale-free networks we will sample latent features
$V$ from some probabilistic distribution and try to generate a network's
adjacency matrix. Entries in the generated matrix are dot products of latent
features which are real numbers. In order to create an adjacency matrix, we
approximate entries with the Boolean domain $\{0, 1\}$. We have incorporated
the threshold parameter $\theta$ into the model for discretization of a dot
product. Actually, we have been influenced by the geographical threshold models
which were recently proven to have good results in a scale-free networks
generation. The overview of our results is the following. First, we will
describe our model formally. Second, we will tune the threshold $\theta$ in
order to generate sparse growing networks. Finally, we will show that our model
produces scale-free networks with the fixed power-law exponent which equals
two. In order to generate oriented networks with tunable power-law exponents

stochastic geometry to characterize the performance of cluster-centric content
placement in a cache-enabled device-to-device (D2D) network. Different from
device-centric content placement, cluster-centric placement focuses on placing
content in each cluster such that the collective performance of all the devices
in each cluster is optimized. Modeling the locations of the devices by a
Poisson cluster process, we define and analyze the performance for three
general cases: (i)$k$-Tx case: receiver of interest is chosen uniformly at
random in a cluster and its content of interest is available at the $k^{th}$
closest device to the cluster center, (ii) $\ell$-Rx case: receiver of interest
is the $\ell^{th}$ closest device to the cluster center and its content of
interest is available at a device chosen uniformly at random from the same
cluster, and (iii) baseline case: the receiver of interest is chosen uniformly
at random in a cluster and its content of interest is available at a device
chosen independently and uniformly at random from the same cluster. Easy-to-use
expressions for the key performance metrics, such as coverage probability and
area spectral efficiency (ASE) of the whole network, are derived for all three
cases. Our analysis concretely demonstrates significant improvement in the
network performance when the device on which content is cached or device
requesting content from cache is biased to lie closer to the cluster center
compared to baseline case. Based on this insight, we develop and analyze a new
generative model for cluster-centric D2D networks that allows to study the
effect of intra-cluster interfering devices that are more likely to lie closer
to the cluster center.

to the Navier-Stokes equation, also known as exact coherent states, are
computed for Newtonian plane Poiseuille flow. The symmetries and streak/vortex
structures are reported and their possible connections to critical layer
dynamics examined. While some of the solutions clearly display fluctuations
that are localized around the critical layer (the surface on which the
streamwise velocity matches the wave speed of the solution), for others this
connection is not as clear. Dynamical trajectories along unstable directions of
the solutions are computed. Over certain ranges of Reynolds number, two
solution families are shown to lie on the basin boundary between laminar and
turbulent flow. Direct comparison of nonlinear travelling wave solutions to
turbulent flow in the same channel is presented. The state-space dynamics of
the turbulent flow are organized around one of the newly-identified travelling
wave families, and in particular the lower branch solutions of this family are
closely approached during transient excursions away from the dominant
behaviour. These observations provide a firm dynamical-systems foundation for
prior observations that minimal channel turbulence displays time intervals of
""active"" turbulence punctuated by brief periods of ""hibernation"" (see e.g. Xi,
L. and Graham, M. D., Phys. Rev. Lett., 104, 218301 (2010)). The hibernating
intervals are approaches to lower branch nonlinear travelling waves.
Representing these solutions on a Prandtl-von Karman plot illustrates how their
bulk flow properties are related to those of Newtonian turbulence as well as
the universal asymptotic state called maximum drag reduction (MDR) found in
viscoelastic turbulent flow.

explore these theories from the perspective of gravity dual. We find that the

where repulson singularities are absent. We argue that supergravity description
is unreliable in the region near these enhancon points. Instead, we show how to
construct reliable sugra duals to particular points on the Coulomb branch where
the enhancon is screened. We explore how these singularities reappear as one
moves around in Coulomb branch and comment on possible field theory
interpretation of this phenomenon. In analyzing gauge/gravity duality for these
models, we encountered one unexpected surprise, that the condition for the
supergravity solution to be reliable and supersymmetric is somewhat weaker than
the expectation from field theory. We also discuss similar issues for theories

Carlo (DQMC). In the single-particle response, we observe that the effects of
correlations weaken rapidly with doping, such that one may expect the random
phase approximation (RPA) to provide an adequate description of the
two-particle response. In contrast, when compared to RPA, we find that
significant residual correlations in the two-particle excitations persist up to
$40\%$ hole and $15\%$ electron doping (the range of dopings achieved in the
cuprates). These fundamental differences between the doping evolution of
single- and multi-particle renormalizations show that conclusions drawn from
single-particle processes cannot necessarily be applied to multi-particle

periodic brightness variation in a region of Saturn's D ring that previously
appeared to be rather featureless. Furthermore, the intensity and radial
wavenumber of this pattern have decreased steadily with time since it was first
observed. Based on analogies with similar structures elsewhere in the D ring,
we propose that this structure was created by some event that disturbed the
orbital motions of the ring particles, giving them finite orbital
eccentricities and initially aligned pericenters. Differential orbital
precession then transformed this structure into a spiral pattern in the ring's
optical depth that became increasingly tightly wound over time. The observed
trends in the pattern's radial wavenumber are roughly consistent with this
basic model, and also indicate that the ring-disturbing event occurred in early
December 2011. Similar events in 1979 may have generated the periodic patterns
seen in this same region by the Voyager spacecraft. The 2011 event could have
been caused by debris striking the rings, or by a disturbance in the planet's
electromagnetic environment. The rapid reduction in the intensity of the
brightness variations over the course of just a few years indicates that some
process is either damping orbital eccentricities in this region or causing the
orbital pericenters of particles with the same semi-major axis to become
misaligned.

same manner as photons. This means that for every photon-driven body force,
there should be a sublimation-driven analogue that affects icy bodies. Thermal
photons emitted from the surfaces of asymmetrically shaped bodies in the Solar
System generate net torques that change the spin rates of these bodies over
time. The long-term averaging of this torque is called the YORP effect. Here we
propose a sublimation-driven analogue to the YORP effect (SYORP), in which
sublimating gas molecules emitted from the surfaces of icy bodies also generate
net torques on the bodies. However, sublimating molecules carry momentum away
from the body at a rate ~10^4-10^5 greater than thermal photons, resulting in
much greater body torques. While previous studies of sublimative torques
focused on emissions from highly localized sources on the surfaces of Jupiter
Family Comet nuclei, SYORP applies to non-localized emissions across the entire
body, which likely dominates sublimation-drive torques on small icy chunks and
Dynamically Young Comets, and can therefore be applied without high-resolution
spacecraft observations of their surfaces. Instead, we repurpose the equations
of the YORP effect to account for sublimation-driven torques. We show how an
SYORP-driven mechanism best matches observations of the Sun-oriented lineaments
(striae) of comet tails, whose formation mechanism has remained enigmatic for
decades. The SYORP effect explains why striae are observed between
near-perihelion and ~1 AU from the Sun for comets with perihelia less than 0.6
AU, and solves longstanding problems with moving enough material into the
cometary tail to form visible striae. We show that SYORP can form striae that
match those of Comet West, and produce a power-law size frequency distribution
of their parent chunks with an index of -1.4 (-1.1- 2).

use of hard X-ray optics with multilayer coatings, with angular resolutions
comparable to the achieved ones in the soft X-rays. One of the crucial points
in X-ray optics, indeed, is multilayer interfacial microroughness that causes
effective area reduction and X-Ray Scattering (XRS). The latter, in particular,
is responsible for image quality degradation. Interfacial smoothness
deterioration in multilayer deposition processes is commonly observed as a
result of substrate profile replication and intrinsic random deposition noise.
For this reason, roughness growth should be carefully investigated by surface
topographic analysis, X-ray reflectivity and XRS measurements. It is convenient
to express the roughness evolution in terms of interface Power Spectral
Densities (PSD), that are directly related to XRS and, in turn, in affecting
the optic HEW (Half Energy Width). In order to interpret roughness
amplification and to help us to predict the imaging performance of hard X-ray
optics, we have implemented a well known kinetic continuum equation model in a
IDL language program (MPES, Multilayer PSDs Evolution Simulator), allowing us
the determination of characteristic growth parameters in multilayer coatings.
In this paper we present some results from analysis we performed on several
samples coated with hard X-ray multilayers (W/Si, Pt/C, Mo/Si) using different

HEW requirement for ATHENA) is determined by the accuracy alignment of the XOUs
within the assembly, but also by the angular resolution of the individual XOU.
This is affected by the mirror shape accuracy, its surface roughness, and the
mutual alignment of the mirrors within the XOU itself. Because of the large
number of XOUs to be produced, quality tests need to be routinely done to
select the most performing stacked blocks, to be integrated into the final
optic. In addition to the usual metrology based on profile and roughness
measurements, a direct measurement with a broad, parallel, collimated and
uniform X- ray beam would be the most reliable test, without the need of a
focal spot reconstruction as usually done in synchrotron light. To this end, we
designed the BEaTriX (Beam Expander Testing X-ray facility) to be realized at
INAF-OAB, devoted to the functional tests of the XOUs. A grazing incidence
parabolic mirror and an asymmetrically cut crystal will produce a parallel
X-ray beam broad enough to illuminate the entire aperture of the focusing

record the image. The selection of different crystals will enable to test the
XOUs in the 1 - 5 keV range, included in the X-ray energy band of ATHENA

anisotropic strain change generated by the ferroelectric substrate. Thus, an
electric field pulse can be used to 'set' and 'reset' the magnetic anisotropy
orientation and resistive state in the film, as well as lowering the coercive
field required to reverse magnetization, showing a promising route towards
electric-field manipulation of multifunctional nanostructures at room
temperature.

measured in the pseudorapidity interval $|\eta|$<2.5. The correlation functions

a multiplicity-dependent enhancement at $\Delta \phi \sim 0$ that extends over
a wide range of $\Delta\eta$, which has been referred to as the ""ridge"".
Per-trigger-particle yields, $Y(\Delta \phi)$, are measured over
2<$|\Delta\eta|$<5. For both collision energies, the $Y(\Delta \phi)$
distribution in all multiplicity intervals is found to be consistent with a
linear combination of the per-trigger-particle yields measured in collisions
with less than 20 reconstructed tracks, and a constant combinatoric
contribution modulated by $\cos{(2\Delta \phi)}$. The fitted Fourier
coefficient, $v_{2,2}$, exhibits factorization, suggesting that the ridge
results from per-event $\cos{(2\phi)}$ modulation of the single-particle
distribution with Fourier coefficients $v_2$. The $v_2$ values are presented as
a function of multiplicity and transverse momentum. They are found to be
approximately constant as a function of multiplicity and to have a
$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ dependence similar to that measured in $p$+Pb and Pb+Pb
collisions. The $v_2$ values in the 13 and 2.76 TeV data are consistent within
uncertainties. These results suggest that the ridge in $pp$ collisions arises
from the same or similar underlying physics as observed in $p$+Pb collisions,
and that the dynamics responsible for the ridge has no strong $\sqrt{s}$

setting proper manufacturing tolerances to guarantee an angular resolution -
often expressed in terms of Point Spread Function (PSF) - as needed by the
specific science goal. To do this, we need an accurate metrological apparatus,
covering a very broad range of spatial frequencies, and an affordable method to
compute the PSF from the metrology dataset. [...] However, the separation
between these spectral ranges is difficult do define exactly, and it is also
unclear how to affordably combine the PSFs, computed with different methods in
different spectral ranges, into a PSF expectation at a given X-ray energy. For
this reason, we have proposed a method entirely based on the Huygens-Fresnel
principle to compute the diffracted field of real Wolter-I optics, including
measured defects over a wide range of spatial frequencies. Owing to the shallow
angles at play, the computation can be simplified limiting the computation to
the longitudinal profiles, neglecting completely the effect of roundness
errors. Other authors had already proposed similar approaches in the past, but
only in far-field approximation, therefore they could not be applied to the
case of Wolter-I optics, in which two reflections occur in sequence within a
short range. The method we suggest is versatile, as it can be applied to
multiple reflection systems, at any X-ray energy, and regardless of the nominal
shape of the mirrors in the optical system. The method has been implemented in
the WISE code, successfully used to explain the measured PSFs of
multilayer-coated optics for astronomic use, and of a K-B optical system in use
at the FERMI free electron laser.

profile of a galaxy to the adiabatic growth of its central SMBH. In a first
step we convert observationally inferred feedback powers into SMBH growth rates
by using reasonable energy conversion efficiency parameters, $\epsilon$. In the
main part of this paper we use these black hole growth rates, sorted in
logarithmically increasing steps encompassing our whole parameter space, to
conduct $N$-Body computations of brightest cluster galaxies with the newly
developed MUESLI software. For the initial setup of galaxies we use core-Sersic
models in order to account for SMBH scouring. We find that adiabatically driven
core re-growth is significant at the highest accretion rates. As a result, the
most massive black holes should be located in BCGs with less pronounced cores
when compared to the predictions of empirical scaling relations which are
usually calibrated in less extreme environments. For efficiency parameters
$\epsilon<0.1$, BCGs in the most massive, relaxed and X-ray luminous galaxy
clusters might even develop steeply rising density cusps. Finally, we discuss
several promising candidates for follow up investigations, among them the
nuclear black hole in the Phoenix cluster. Based on our results, it might have

of the fourth order linear stochastic equation of Mullins and Herring (MH).
Thus, surface dynamics in both systems is dominated by diffusion of adsorbed
molecules, with no large scale effect of possible inhomogeneities in mass flux
from the solution or in reaction and adsorption rates. In growth on n-Si
substrates, the noise amplitude of the MH equation increases in time as
t^{0.8}, while the coefficient of the curvature-related term is
time-independent. Step edge energy barriers restrict the mass flux across grain
boundaries, thus a broad size distribution of initial grains leads to
coarsening of the larger ones. This explains their V shape in the thickest

are reduced in films grown on Ni/n-Si, which initially have much larger grains

generalized Forchheimer flow of fluid through porous media. The diffusive
capacity is an integral characteristic of the flow motivated by the engineering
notion of the productivity index (PI), Dake 1983, Raghavan 1993, Christopher et
al. 2014. The PI characterizes the well capacity with respect to drainage area
of the well and in general is time dependent. We study its time dynamics for
two types of fluids: slightly compressible and strongly compressible fluid
(ideal gas). In case of the slightly compressible fluid the PI stabilizes in
time to the specific value, determined by the so-called pseudo steady state
solution, Aulisa et al. 2009, 2011, 2012. Here we generalize our results from
Aulisa et al. 2012 on long term dynamics of the PI in case of arbitrary order
of the nonlinearity of the flow.
  In this paper we study the mathematical model of the PI for compressible gas
flow for the first time. In contrast to slightly compressible fluid this
functional mathematically speaking is not time-invariant. At the same time it
stays ""almost"" constant for a long period of time, but then it rapidly blows up
as time approaches the certain critical value. This value depends on the
initial data (initial reserves) of the reservoir. The ""greater"" are the initial
reserves, the larger is this critical value. We present numerical and

Gaussian gravitational wave stochastic background signal and noise
distributions, as well as homogenous detector sensitivities, the standard
cross-correlation detection statistic is known to be optimal in the sense of
minimizing the probability of a false dismissal at a fixed value of the
probability of a false alarm. The focus of this paper is to analyze the
comparative efficiency of this statistic, versus a simple alternative statistic
obtained by cross-correlating the \textit{squared} measurements, in situations
that deviate from such standard assumptions. We find that differences in
detector sensitivities have a large impact on the comparative efficiency of the
cross-correlation detection statistic, which is dominated by the alternative
statistic when these differences reach one order of magnitude. This effect
holds even when both the signal and noise distributions are Gaussian. While the
presence of non-Gaussian signals has no material impact for reasonable
parameter values, the relative inefficiency of the cross-correlation statistic
is less prominent for fat-tailed noise distributions but it is magnified in
case noise distributions have skewness parameters of opposite signs. Our
results suggest that introducing an alternative detection statistic can lead to
noticeable sensitivity gains when noise distributions are possibly non-Gaussian
and/or when detector sensitivities exhibit substantial differences, a situation
that is expected to hold in joint detections from Advanced LIGO and Advanced
Virgo, in particular in the early phases of development of the detectors, or in
joint detections from Advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope.

result that emerge from an analytical calculation of the band structure of the
Lieb ribbon including gain and loss, is that its flat band survives the
addition of PT-symmetry for any amount of gain and loss, while for the other
two lattices, any presence of gain and loss destroys the flat bands. For all
three ribbons, there are finite stability windows whose size decreases with the
strength of the gain and loss parameter. For the Lieb and kagome cases, the
size of this window converges to a finite value. The existence of finite
stability windows, plus the constancy of the Lieb flat band are in marked

Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values based on Gamma distribution for a
low rainfall and a high rainfall district of Andhra Pradesh state, India.
Comparison of SPI, with actual rainfall and rainfall deviation from the mean
indicated that SPI values under-estimate the intensity of dryness/wetness when
the rainfall is very low/very high respectively. As a result, the SPI in the
worst drought years of 2002 and 2006 in the low rainfall district has indicated
only moderate dryness instead of extreme dryness. The range of SPI values of
the high rainfall district indicated better stretching, compared to that of the
low rainfall district. Further, the SPI values of longer time scale (2-, 3- and
4- months) showed an extended range compared to 1-month, but the sensitivity in
drought years has not improved significantly.
  To ascertain whether non normality of SPI is a possible reason, normality
tests were conducted. The Shapiro-Wilk statistic, p-values and absolute value
of the median confirmed normal distribution of SPI in both the districts
whereas cumulative probability distribution of SPI indicated deviation from
normal probability in the lower and upper ranges.
  Therefore, it is suggested that SPI as a stand alone indicator needs to be
interpreted with caution to assess the intensity of drought. Further
investigations should include; sensitivity of SPI to the estimated shape and
scale at lower and upper bounds of gamma and impact of other distributions such
as Pearson III on SPI computation, to complement the above results.

self-coupling is of the order of $g^2$ and Higgs is predicted to be light,
being consistent with the LHC results. When the gauge group is simple, the weak
mixing angle is also predictable. We address a question whether there exists a
model of gauge-Higgs unification in 6-dimensional space-time, which
successfully predicts the mass ratios of the Higgs boson and weak gauge bosons.
First, by use of a useful formula we give a general argument on the condition
to get a realistic prediction of the weak mixing angle $sin^{2}theta_{W} =
1/4$, and find that triplet and sextet representations of the minimal SU(3)
gauge group lead to the realistic prediction. Concerning the Higgs mass, we
notice that in the models with one Higgs doublet, the predicted Higgs mass is
always the same: $M_H = 2 M_W$. However, by extending our discussion to the
models with two Higgs doublets, the situation changes: we obtain an interesting
prediction $M_{H} leq 2M_{W}$ at the leading order of the perturbation. Thus it
is possible to recover the observed Higgs mass, 125 GeV, for a suitable choice
of the parameter. The situation is in clear contrast to the case of the minimal
supersymmetric standard model, where $M_{H} leq M_{Z}$ at the classical level
and the predicted Higgs mass cannot recover the observed value.

determine if genetic measures are associated with trajectories of lung function
as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC), children in the primary cohort
study retrospectively had candidate loci evaluated. Given participant burden
and constraints on financial resources, it is often desirable to target a
subsample for ascertainment of costly measures. Methods that can leverage the
longitudinal outcome on the full cohort to selectively measure informative
individuals have been promising, but have been restricted in their use to
analysis of the targeted subsample. In this paper we detail two multiple
imputation analysis strategies that exploit outcome and partially observed
covariate data on the nonsampled subjects, and we characterize alternative
design and analysis combinations that could be used for future studies of
pulmonary function and other outcomes. Candidate predictor (e.g., IL10 cytokine
polymorphisms) associations obtained from targeted sampling designs can be
estimated with very high efficiency compared to standard designs. Further, even
though multiple imputation can dramatically improve estimation efficiency for
covariates available on all subjects (e.g., gender and baseline age),
relatively modest efficiency gains were observed in parameters associated with
predictors that are exclusive to the targeted sample. Our results suggest that
future studies of longitudinal trajectories can be efficiently conducted by use

both predicting the distribution of species in a community and identifying the
important variables driving species co-occurrences. Recently, Dunstan, Foster
and Darnell [Ecol. Model. 222 (2011) 955-963] proposed using finite mixture of
regression (FMR) models for multi-species distribution modeling, where species
are clustered based on their environmental response to form a small number of
""archetypal responses."" As an illustrative example, they applied their mixture
model approach to a presence-absence data set of 200 marine organisms,
collected along the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Little attention, however,
was given to the problem of model selection - since the archetypes (mixture
components) may depend on different but likely overlapping sets of covariates,
a method is needed for performing variable selection on all components
simultaneously. In this article, we consider using penalized likelihood
functions for variable selection in FMR models. We propose two penalties which
exploit the grouped structure of the covariates, that is, each covariate is
represented by a group of coefficients, one for each component. This leads to
an attractive form of shrinkage that allows a covariate to be removed from all
components simultaneously. Both penalties are shown to possess specific forms
of variable selection consistency, with simulations indicating they outperform
other methods which do not take into account the grouped structure. When
applied to the Great Barrier Reef data set, penalized FMR models offer more
insight into the important variables driving species co-occurrence in the
marine community (compared to previous results where no model selection was
conducted), while offering a computationally stable method of modeling complex
species-environment relationships (through regularization).

regression function at unknown locations could be estimated using a number of
existing approaches. However, it becomes a challenging problem when the
predictors contain measurement errors. In this paper, an error-in-variables
jump point estimator is suggested for a nonparametric generalized
error-in-variables regression model. A major feature of our method is that it
does not impose any parametric distribution on the measurement error. Its
performance is evaluated by both numerical studies and theoretical
justifications. The method is applied to studying the impact of Medicare Levy

methodology uses hidden Markov models to account for potential co-expression of

studies with technical or biological replicates, automatically adjusting for
any extra-Poisson variability. Moreover, for cases when paired data are
available, hmmSeq includes a paired structure between treatments that
incoporates subject-specific effects. To perform parameter estimation for the
hmmSeq model, we develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
Further, we develop a procedure for detection of differentially expressed genes
that automatically controls false discovery rate. A simulation study shows that
the hmmSeq methodology performs better than competitors in terms of receiver
operating characteristic curves. Finally, the analyses of three publicly
available RNA-seq data sets demonstrate the power and flexibility of the hmmSeq

faithful replication of DNA. The genetic information is also safeguarded by DNA
damage recognition and repair processes. Uracil is one of the most frequently
occurring erroneous base in DNA; it can arise from cytosine deamination or
thymine-replacing incorporation. Two enzyme families are primarily involved in
keeping DNA uracil-free: dUTPases that prevent thymine-replacing incorporation
and uracil-DNA glycosylases that excise uracil from DNA and initiate
uracil-excision repair. Both dUTPase and the most efficient uracil-DNA
glycosylase UNG is thought to be ubiquitous in free-living organisms. In the
present work, we have systematically investigated the genotype of deposited
fully sequenced bacterial and Archaeal genomes. Surprisingly, we have found
that in contrast to the generally held opinion, a wide number of bacterial and
Archaeal species lack the dUTPase gene(s). The dut- genotype is present in
diverse bacterial phyla indicating that loss of this (or these) gene(s) has
occurred multiple times during evolution. We have identified several survival
strategies in lack of dUTPases: i) simultaneous lack or inhibition of UNG, ii)
acquisition of a less dUTP-specific sanitizing nucleotide pyrophosphatase, and
iii) supply of dUTPase from bacteriophages. Our data indicate that several
unicellular microorganisms may efficiently cope with a dut- genotype
potentially leading to an unusual uracil-enrichment in their genomic DNA.

While the distribution of inter-event times is often assimilated to power-law
density functions, a debate persists on the nature of an underlying model that
explains the observed distribution. In the present, we propose an intuitive
explanation to understand the observed dependence of subsequent waiting times.
Our contribution is twofold. The first idea consists of separating the short
waiting times -- out of scope for power-law distributions -- from the long
ones. The model is further enhanced by introducing a two-state Markovian

paper proposes a probabilistic and fast matching scheme, which computation
costs requires O(N) additions and O(K \log K) multiplications, based on
cross-correlation. The nuclear idea is to first downsample signal, which size
becomes O(K), and then subsequent operations only involves downsampled signals.
The probability of successful match depends on cross-correlation between signal

all galaxies, including the most metal-poor galaxy of our sample (0.1 Zsun); to
our knowledge this is the largest number of 12CO(1-0) detections ever reported
for galaxies with 12+logO/H<=8 (0.2 Zsun) outside the Local Group. We calculate
stellar masses (Mstar) and star-formation rates (SFRs), and analyze our results
by combining our observations with galaxy samples from the literature.
Extending previous results for a correlation of the molecular gas depletion
time, tau(dep), with Mstar and specific SFR (sSFR), we find a variation in
tau(dep) of a factor of 200 or more (from <50 Myr to 10 Gyr) over a spread of
1000 in sSFR and Mstar. We exploit the variation of tau(dep) to constrain the
CO-to-H2 mass conversion factor alpha(CO) at low metallicity, and assuming a
power-law variation find alpha(CO) \propto (Z/Zsun)^1.9, similar to results
based on dust continuum measurements compared with gas mass. By including HI
measurements, we show that the fraction of total gas mass relative to the
baryonic mass is higher in galaxies that are metal poor, of low mass, and of
high sSFR. Finally, comparisons of the data with star-formation models of the
molecular gas phases suggest that, at metallicities Z/Zsun<=0.2, there are some

requires bulk acceleration of the emission region, which is consistent with a
Poynting-flux-dominated outflow. In this paper, we systematically analyze a
sample of 85 bright X-ray flares detected in 63 Swift GRBs, and investigate the
relationship between the temporal decay index $\alpha$ and spectral index
$\beta$ during the steep decay phase of these flares. The $\alpha$ value
depends on the choice of the zero time point $t_0$. We adopt two methods.
""Method I"" takes $t_0^I$ as the first rising data point of each flare, and is
the most conservative approach. We find that at 99.9% condifence level 56/85
flares have decay slopes steeper than the simplest curvature effect prediction,
and therefore, are in the acceleration regime. ""Method II"" extrapolates the
rising light curve of each flare backwards until the flux density is three
orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux density, and defines the
corresponding time as the time zero point (t_0^II). We find that 74/85 flares
fall into the acceleration regime at 99.9% condifence level. This suggests that
bulk acceleration is common, may be even ubiquitous among X-ray flares,
pointing towards a Poynting-flux-dominated jet composition for these events.

to the Navier--Stokes equations in the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of
incompressible channel flow. Simulations driven by constant flow rate, constant
pressure gradient and constant power input are used to build large databases,
and in particular to store the complete temporal trace of the wall-shear stress
for later analysis. As these approaches correspond to different dynamical
systems, it can in principle be envisaged that these differences are reflect by
certain statistics of the turbulent flow field. The instantaneous realizations
of the flow in the various simulations are obviously different, but, as
expected, the usual one-point, one-time statistics do not show any appreciable
difference. However, the PDF for the fluctuations of the streamwise component
of wall friction reveals that the simulation with constant flow rate presents
lower probabilities for extreme events of large positive friction. The low
probability value of such events explains their negligible contribution to the
commonly computed statistics; however, the very existence of a difference in
the PDF demonstrates that the forcing term is not entirely uninfluential. Other
statistics for wall-based quantities (the two components of friction and
pressure) are examined; in particular spatio-temporal autocorrelations show
small differences at large temporal separations, where unfortunately the
residual statistical uncertainty is still of the same order of the observed
difference. Hence we suggest that the specific choice of the forcing term does
not produce important statistical consequences, unless one is interested in the
strongest events of high wall friction, that are underestimated by a simulation
run at constant flow rate.

spherical-like coordinate system, reducing the problem to one-dimensional
radial and angular parts. Both radial and angular equations can be solved
exactly in terms of general Heun functions. We also provide perturbative
solutions to first-order in a suitably defined acceleration parameter, and
compute the acceleration-induced corrections to the particle absorption rate as

problem in the low-frequency limit. Furthermore, we show that the angular
eigenvalue problem can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the analogous
problem for a Kerr spacetime, by identifying a map between these ""acceleration""

the nature of the coupling between intrinsic spin and spacetime acceleration in

with bounded tree-cut width, it is important to have a parametrically tractable
way to compute the exact value of this parameter or, at least, some constant

the azimuthally-averaged circular velocity and non-circular motions, primarily
caused by gas streaming along the bar. These non-circular flows must be
accounted for before the observed velocities can be used in mass modeling. In
this work, we examine the performance of the tilted-ring method and the DiskFit
algorithm for transforming velocity maps of barred spiral galaxies into
rotation curves (RCs) using simulated data. We find that the tilted-ring
method, which does not account for streaming motions, under/over-estimates the
circular motions when the bar is parallel/perpendicular to the projected major
axis. DiskFit, which does include streaming motions, is limited to orientations
where the bar is not-aligned with either the major or minor axis of the image.
Therefore, we propose a method of correcting RCs based on numerical simulations
of galaxies. We correct the RC derived from the tilted-ring method based on a
numerical simulation of a galaxy with similar properties and projections as the
observed galaxy. Using observations of NGC 3319, which has a bar aligned with
the major axis, as a test case, we show that the inferred mass models from the
uncorrected and corrected RCs are significantly different. These results show
the importance of correcting for the non-circular motions and demonstrate that
new methods of accounting for these motions are necessary as current methods
fail for specific bar alignments.

here specifically for lasso logistic regression. Both methods are based on
pilot data. We reexamine the lymphoma and lung cancer data sets to evaluate the
sample sizes, and use resampling to assess the estimation methods. We also
study application to an RNA-seq data set. We find that it is feasible to
estimate sample size for regularized logistic regression if an adequate pilot
data set exists. The GCB and the DC-lung data sets appear adequate, under
specific assumptions. Existing human RNA-seq data sets are by and large
inadequate, and cannot be used as pilot data. Pilot RNA-seq data can be
simulated, and the methods in this paper can be used for sample size
estimation. A MATLAB program is made available.

Secondly, in the setting of $\beta$-expansions, when the set of all the unique
codings is not a subshift of finite type, we can calculate in some cases the
Hausdorff dimension of the univoque set. Motivated by this application, we
prove that the set of all the unique codings is a subshift of finite type if

de Vries and Komornik \cite[Theorem 1.8]{MK}. Thirdly, for the doubling map

the accumulated strain. The tail of this distribution as $\Delta \gamma\to 0$

$\eta$ is related via scaling relations to the tail of the pdf of the
eigenvalues of the {\em plastic modes} of the Hessian matrix $P(\lambda)$ which

slowly quenched amorphous solids they undergo two discontinuous transitions,
first at $\gamma=0^+$ and then at the yield point $\gamma=\gamma_{_{\rm Y}}$ to

smeared out due to the non existing stress peak before yield. The nature of
these transitions and scaling relations with the system size dependence of

observed exponents in the scaling of noise magnitude with conductivity, we
observe unambiguous signatures of percolation in random resistor network,
particularly in WSe2 FETs close to switching, which crosses over to continuum
percolation at a higher doping level. We demonstrate a powerful experimental

moment by a spin-spin interaction, is widely observed in non-artificial
magnetic materials, artificial quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes. In devices
based on quantum dots or carbon nanotubes that target quantum information
applications, the Kondo effect can be tuned by a gate voltage, a magnetic
field, or light. However, the manipulation of the Kondo effect in
non-artificial materials has not been thoroughly studied; in particular, the
artificial creation of the Kondo effect remains unexplored. Per this subject
study, however, a new route for the optical creation of the Kondo effect in the

The Kondo effect emerges under visible-light illumination of the material by a
continuous-wave laser diode and is ultimately revealed by photoinduced
electrical resistivity, which clearly exhibits a logarithmic temperature
dependency. By contrast, a La-based compound (LaZn$_{3}$P$_{3}$) displays only
normal metallic behavior under similar illumination. The photoinduced Kondo
effect, which occurs at higher temperatures when compared with the Kondo effect
in artificial systems, provides a potential new range of operation for not only
quantum information/computation devices but also for operation of magneto-optic
devices thereby expanding the range of device applications based on the Kondo

However, these lengthy representations always cause extremely heavy

applications. A few existing techniques can transfer very high-dimensional data
into binary codes, but they still require the reduced code length to be
relatively long to maintain acceptable accuracies. To target a better balance

novel embedding method called Binary Projection Bank (BPB), which can
effectively reduce the very high-dimensional representations to
medium-dimensional binary codes without sacrificing accuracies. Instead of
using conventional single linear or bilinear projections, the proposed method
learns a bank of small projections via the max-margin constraint to optimally
preserve the intrinsic data similarity. We have systematically evaluated the
proposed method on three datasets: Flickr 1M, ILSVR2010 and UCF101, showing
competitive retrieval and recognition accuracies compared with state-of-the-art

arboviral diseases which takes into account an imperfect vaccine combined with
individual protection and some vector control strategies already studied in the
literature. After the formulation of the model, a qualitative study based on
stability analysis and bifurcation theory reveals that the phenomenon of
backward bifurcation may occur. The stable disease-free equilibrium of the
model coexists with a stable endemic equilibrium when the reproduction number,
R 0 , is less than unity. Using Lyapunov function theory, we prove that the
trivial equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; When the disease--
induced death is not considered, or/and, when the standard incidence is
replaced by the mass action incidence, the backward bifurcation does not occur.
Under a certain condition , we establish the global asymptotic stability of the
disease--free equilibrium of the full model. Through sensitivity analysis, we
determine the relative importance of model parameters for disease transmission.
Numerical simulations show that the combination of several control mechanisms
would significantly reduce the spread of the disease, if we maintain the level
of each control high, and this, over a long period.

the faintest features of spectroscopic observation is, nevertheless, limited by
a number of factors. The most important are the source complexity (line
density), limited spectral resolution and insufficient sideband (image)
rejection (SRR). Dual Sideband (2SB) millimeter receivers separate upper and
lower sideband rejecting the unwanted image by about 15 dB, but they are
difficult to build and, until now, only feasible up to about 500 GHz
(equivalent to ALMA Band 8). For example ALMA Bands 9 (602-720 GHz) and 10
(787-950 GHz) are currently DSB receivers. Aims: This article reports the
implementation of an ALMA Band 9 2SB prototype receiver that makes use of a new
technique called calibrated digital sideband separation. The new method
promises to ease the manufacturing of 2SB receivers, dramatically increase
sideband rejection and allow 2SB instruments at the high frequencies currently
covered only by Double Sideband (DSB) or bolometric detectors. Methods: We made
use of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and fast Analog to Digital
Converters (ADCs) to measure and calibrate the receiver's front end phase and
amplitude imbalances to achieve sideband separation beyond the possibilities of
purely analog receivers. The technique could in principle allow the operation
of 2SB receivers even when only imbalanced front ends can be built,
particularly at very high frequencies. Results: This digital 2SB receiver shows
an average sideband rejection of 45.9 dB while small portions of the band drop
below 40 dB. The performance is 27 dB (a factor of 500) better than the average
performance of the proof-of-concept Band 9 purely-analog 2SB prototype

values of 0.1-0.14 M, increasing with metallicity, is able to reproduce the
colour extension of the old Horizontal Branch. However, leaving the mass loss
as the only free parameter is not enough to match the detailed morphology of
Carina Horizontal Branch. We explored the role played by the star formation
history on the discrepancies between synthetic and observed Horizontal
Branches. We derived a toy bursty star formation history that reproduces the
horizontal branch star counts, and also matches qualitatively the red giant and
the turn off regions. This star formation history is made of a subset of age
and [M/H] components of the star formation history based on turn off and red
giants only, and entails four separate bursts of star formation of different
strenghts, centred at 2, 5, 8.6 and 11.5 Gyr, with mean [M/H] decreasing from
\sim -1.7 to \sim -2.2 for increasing ages, and a Gaussian spread of 0.1 dex.
The comparison between the metallicity distribution function of our star
formation history and the one measured from the infrared CaT feature using a
CaT-[Fe/H] calibration shows a qualitative agreement, once taken into account
the range of [Ca/Fe] abundances measured in a sample of Carina stars, that
biases the derived [Fe/H] distribution toward too low values. In conclusion, we
have shown how the information contained within the horizontal branch of Carina
(and dwarf galaxies in general) can be extracted and interpreted to refine the
star formation history derived from red giants and turn off stars only.

galaxy community to extend these studies to other nearby galaxy groups by
systematically searching for faint, unresolved dwarf members with a low surface
brightness in the Southern Centaurus group of galaxies. The aim is to determine
whether these coplanar, corotating structures are a universal phenomenon. We
imaged an area of 60 square degrees (0.3 Mpc$^2$) around the M83 subgroup with
the wide-field Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the CTIO 4 m Blanco telescope in
$g$ and $r$ down to a limiting surface brightness of $\mu_r\approx 30$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$. Various image-filtering techniques were applied to the DECam
data to enhance the visibility of extremely low-surface brightness objects. We
report the discovery of 16 new dwarf galaxy candidates in the direction of the
M83 subgroup, roughly doubling the number of known dwarfs in that region. The
photometric properties of the candidates, when compared to those of the Local
Group, suggest membership in the M83 subgroup. The faintest objects have a
central star density of $\approx1.3 L_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ and a total magnitude of
$g = 20.25$, corresponding to $M_g = -9.55$ at the nominal distance of 4.9 Mpc.

characterization of the synchrotron peak with Swift and NuSTAR. During the
campaign, the nearby BL Lac object was observed in both a quiescent and an
elevated state. The broadband campaign includes observations with NuSTAR,
MAGIC, VERITAS, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), Swift X-ray Telescope and
UV Optical Telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including the
GASP-WEBT program, as well as radio observations by OVRO, Mets\""ahovi and the
F-Gamma consortium. Some of the MAGIC observations were affected by a sand
layer from the Saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-event
corrections derived with a LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) facility. This
is the first time that LIDAR information is used to produce a physics result
with Cherenkov Telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, and
hence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-ray
instruments. The NuSTAR instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hard
X-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3
and 79 keV consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard X-ray variability
on hour timescales. None (of the four extended NuSTAR observations) shows
evidence of the onset of inverse-Compton emission at hard X-ray energies. We
apply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-Compton model to five
simultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. We find that the
synchrotron self-Compton model can reproduce the observed broadband states
through a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increase
in the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for the
high-energy emission.

inherent to strong line HII methods which are routinely applied to massive data
sets of galaxies. We find [Z]= +0.07 $\pm$ 0.03 and compare our measurements to
HII strong line calibrations. Our abundances and literature data suggest the
presence of a flat metallicity gradient, which can be explained as
redistribution of metal-rich gas following the strong interaction.

from the hadronic decay of a boosted $W$ or $Z$ boson, this paper presents a
technique for further differentiating $Z$ bosons from $W$ bosons. The variables
used are jet mass, jet charge, and a b-tagging discriminant. A likelihood
tagger is constructed from these variables and tested in the simulation of
$W'\rightarrow WZ$ for bosons in the transverse momentum range 200 GeV
$<p_{T}<$ 400 GeV in $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector

10%, one can achieve $W^+$-boson tagging rejection factors ($1/\epsilon_{W^+}$)
of 1.7, 8.3 and 1000, respectively. It is not possible to measure these
efficiencies in the data due to the lack of a pure sample of high $p_{T}$,
hadronically decaying $Z$ bosons. However, the modelling of the tagger inputs
for boosted $W$ bosons is studied in data using a $t\bar{t}$-enriched sample of

modelled within uncertainties, which builds confidence in the expected tagger

uncertainties (consistent with the uncertainty relation) is believed to spread
very slowly, so that the dynamics is deterministic. This assumes that the
classical motions for given initial data are unique. In fluid turbulence
non-uniqueness due to ""roughness"" of the advecting velocity field is known to
lead to stochastic motion of classical particles. Vanishingly small random
perturbations are magnified by Richardson diffusion in a ""nearly rough""
velocity field so that motion remains stochastic as the noise disappears, or
classical spontaneous stochasticity, . Analogies between stochastic particle
motion in turbulence and quantum evolution suggest that there should be quantum
spontaneous stochasticity (QSS). We show this for 1D models of a particle in a
repulsive potential that is ""nearly rough"" with $V(x) \sim C|x|^{1+\alpha}$ at
distances $|x|\gg \ell$ , for some UV cut-off $\ell$, and for initial Gaussian
wave-packet centered at 0. We consider the WKB limit with $\hbar/m \to 0$, then
position-spread $\sigma\to 0$. The limit of the position density is
non-deterministic, with equal probabilities of the particle following either of
two, non-unique classical solutions and with ""Richardson-like"" spreading of the
wave-packet. The splitting of the wave-packet occurs in a very short time
$t\sim(\ell^{1+\alpha}/C)^{1/2}$ for small $\ell$. QSS also occurs in the
scattering of a wave-packet off the rough potential, for careful fine-tuning.
We also consider other semi-classical limits by a numerical solution of the
Schr\""odinger equation, observing QSS both in position- and momentum-space.
Although the wave-function remains split into two widely separated branches in
the classical limit, rapid phase oscillations within each branch prevent any
coherent superposition. These effects should be observable in laboratory
experiments.

the uncertainties on model parameters. We show that the two spectra can be
successfully fit in near-equipartition conditions, defined by the ratio of the
energy density of relativistic electrons to magnetic field $\zeta_{\rm e}$
being close to unity. In both spectra, the observed X-rays are dominated by
synchrotron-self Compton photons, and the observed $\gamma$ rays are dominated
by Compton scattering of external infrared photons from a surrounding dusty
torus.
  Model parameters are well constrained. From the low state to the high state,
both the curvature of the log-parabola width parameter and the synchrotron peak
frequency significantly increase. The derived magnetic fields in the two states
are nearly identical ($\sim1$\ G), but the Doppler factor in the high state is
larger than that in the low state ($\sim$28 versus $\sim$18). We derive that
the gamma-ray emission site takes place outside the broad-line region, at

ForeCAT is able to reproduce the deflection of observed CMEs (Kay et al.

momentum close to the Sun, followed by little to no increase at farther
distances. Here we quantify the distance at which the CME deflection is

wind has negligible influence on the total deflection. We consider a wide range
in CME masses and radial speeds and determine that the deflection and rotation
of these CMEs can be well-described by assuming they propagate with constant
angular momentum beyond 10 Rs. The assumption of constant angular momentum
beyond 10 Rs yields underestimates of the total deflection at 1 AU of only 1%
to 5% and underestimates of the rotation of 10%. Since the deflection from
magnetic forces is determined by 10 Rs, non-magnetic forces must be responsible

significant concurrent microstructure changes that can alter the mechanical
properties in a profound manner. Such microstructure evolution is usually
absent in mesoscale deformation models and simulations. Here we present an
integrated full-field modeling scheme that couples the mechanical response with
the underlying microstructure evolution. As a first demonstration, we integrate
a fast Fourier transform-based elasto-viscoplastic (FFT-EVP) model with a
phase-field (PF) recrystallization model, and carry out three-dimensional (3D)
simulations of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in polycrystalline copper. A
physics-based coupling between FFT-EVP and PF is achieved by (1) adopting a
dislocation-based constitutive model in FFT-EVP, which allows the predicted
dislocation density distribution to be converted to a stored energy
distribution and passed to PF, and (2) implementing a stochastic nucleation
model for DRX. Calibrated with the experimental DRX stress-strain curves, the
integrated model is able to deliver full-field mechanical and microstructural
information, from which quantitative description and analysis of DRX can be
achieved. It is suggested that the initiation of DRX occurs significantly
earlier than previous predictions, due to heterogeneous deformation. DRX grains
are revealed to form at both grain boundaries and junctions (e.g., quadruple
junctions) and tend to maintain a triple line with old grains during the
growth. The resulted stress redistribution is found to have a profound
influence on the subsequent dislocation evolution and the softening.

location given an estimated shape, even when head pose variations are large and
the facial landmarks are very sparsely distributed. Furthermore, we study the
impact of training data imbalance on model performance and propose a training
sample augmentation scheme that produces more initialisations for training
samples from the minority. More specifically, the augmentation number for a
training sample is made to be negatively correlated to the value of the fitted
probability density function at the sample's position. We evaluate the proposed
scheme on both human and sheep facial landmarks localisation. On the benchmark
300w human face dataset, we demonstrate the benefits of our proposed methods
and show very competitive performance when comparing to other methods. On a
newly created sheep face dataset, we get very good performance despite the fact

fully account for the whole set of phenomena that occur during the testing of
such materials. This lack of precision is mainly due to the absence of energy
terms related to the microstructural properties of the fabric and, in
particular, to the bending stiffness of the yarns. In this paper it is shown
that in the unbalanced fabrics the different bending stiffnesses of the warp
and weft yarns produce macroscopic effects that are extremely visible as, for
example, the asymmetric S-shape during a Bias Extension Test (BET).
  We propose to introduce a constrained micromorphic model and a discrete model
that are able to account for i) the angle variation between warp and weft tows,
ii) the unbalance in the bending stiffness of the yarns and iii) the relative
slipping of the tows.
  The constrained micromorphic model is framed in the spirit of the Principle
of Virtual Powers for the equilibrium of continuum bodies. A suitable
constraint is introduced by means of Lagrange multipliers in the strain
energydens ity and the resulting constrained model tends a particular second
gradientone. The main advantage of using such constrained micromorphic model is
that the kinematical and traction boundary conditions that can be imposed on
the boundary of the considered body take a natural and unique meaning.
  The discrete model is set up by opportunely interconnecting Euler-Bernoulli
beams with different bending stiffnesses in the two directions by means of
rotational and translational elastic springs. The main advantage of such
discrete model is that the slipping of the tows is described in a rather
realistic way. Suitable numerical simulations are presented for both the
continuum and the discrete models and a comparison between the simulations and
the experimental results is made showing a definitely good agreement.

cooperativity length remains the same compared to the drawn sample while a huge
increase of the fragility index is recorded. By splitting the fragility index

have been formulated successfully to simulate the behavior of quasi-brittle
materials whose mechanical behavior is inherently connected to fracture
processes occurring in the internal heterogeneous structure. These models tend
to be intensive from the computational point of view as they adopt an a priori
discretization anchored to the major material heterogeneities (e.g. grains in
particulate materials and aggregate pieces in cementitious composites) and this
hampers their use in the numerical simulations of large systems. In this work,
this problem is addressed by formulating a general multiple scale computational
framework based on classical asymptotic analysis and that (1) is applicable to
any discrete model with rotational degrees of freedom; and (2) gives rise to an
equivalent Cosserat continuum. The developed theory is applied to the upscaling
of the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), a recently formulated discrete
model for concrete and other quasi-brittle materials, and the properties of the
homogenized model are analyzed thoroughly in both the elastic and inelastic
regime. The analysis shows that the homogenized micropolar elastic properties
are size-dependent, and they are functions of the RVE size and the size of the
material heterogeneity. Furthermore, the analysis of the homogenized inelastic
behavior highlights issues associated with the homogenization of fine-scale
models featuring strain-softening and the related damage localization. Finally,
nonlinear simulations of the RVE behavior subject to curvature components
causing bending and torsional effects demonstrates, contrarily to typical
Cosserat formulations, a significant coupling between the homogenized
stress-strain and couple-curvature constitutive equations.
