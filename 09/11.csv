arguments, supported by our simulations, that the scaling relation between the

can be different, depending on the main mechanism of energy transport: by
weakly-scattered waves or by noninteracting colliding particles performing Levy

Extensions to CDI broaden the scope of the technique for use in a wide variety

demonstrate a new extension to CDI that encodes additional information through
the use of a series of randomly coded masks. The information gained from the
few additional diffraction measurements removes the need for typical
object-domain constraints; the algorithm uses prior information about the masks
instead. The experiment is performed using a laser diode at 532.2 nm, enabling
rapid prototyping for future X-ray synchrotron and even free electron laser
experiments. Diffraction patterns are collected with up to 15 different masks
placed between a CCD detector and a single sample. Phase retrieval is performed
using a convex relaxation routine known as ""PhaseCut"" followed by a variation
on Fienup's input-output algorithm. The reconstruction quality is judged via
calculation of phase retrieval transfer functions as well as by an object-space
comparison between reconstructions and a lens-based image of the sample. The
results of this analysis indicate that with enough masks (in this case 3 or 4)
the diffraction phases converge reliably, implying stability and uniqueness of

excess in the $(2e)(2jets)$ channel around 2.1 TeV. Interpretation of this data
is reconsidered in terms of the production of a right-handed weak gauge boson,
$W_R$, of the left-right symmetric model and in an $SO(10)$ grand unified
theory abiding by the Extended Survival Hypothesis. The left-right symmetric
model can be consistent with this excess if (a) the heavy right-handed neutrino
has a mass near $W_R$, or (b) if $g_L \neq g_R$, or (c) the right-handed CKM
matrix is nontrivial. Combinations of the above possibilities are also viable.
A $W_R$ with a mass in the TeV region if embedded in $SO(10)$ is not compatible
with $g_L = g_R$. Rather, it implies $0.64 \leq g_R/g_L \leq 0.78$. Further, a
unique symmetry-breaking route -- the order being left-right discrete symmetry
breaking first, followed by $SU(4)_C$ and finally $SU(2)_R$ -- to the standard
model is picked out. The $L \leftrightarrow R$ discrete symmetry has to be
broken at around $10^{16}$ GeV. The grand unification scale is pushed to
$10^{18}$ GeV making the detection of proton decay in ongoing searches rather
unlikely. The $SU(4)_C$ breaking scale can be at its allowed lower limit of
$10^6$ GeV so that $n - \bar{n}$ oscillation or flavour changing processes such
as $K_L \rightarrow \mu e$ and $B_{d,s} \rightarrow \mu e$ may be detectable.
The Higgs scalar multiplets responsible for $SO(10)$ symmetry breaking at
various stages are uniquely identified so long as one adheres to a minimalist
principle. We also remark, {\em en passant}, about a partially unified
Pati-Salam model.

$E$ can be used to find upper bounds for the rank of the Mordell-Weil group,
and to compute covering curves that assist in the search for generators of this
group. The general method of 4-descent, developed in the PhD theses of Siksek,
Womack and Stamminger, has been implemented in Magma (when $K={\mathbb Q}$) and
works well for elliptic curves with sufficiently small discriminant. By
extending work of Bremner and Cassels, we describe the improvements that can be
made when $E$ has a rational 2-torsion point. In particular, when $E$ has full
rational 2-torsion, we describe a method for 8-descent that is practical for
elliptic curves $E/{\mathbb Q}$ with large discriminant.

In such a framework we construct the complete set of dimension-six operators

entropy-based, making use of the chain rule for relative entropy along with the
recursive structure in the definition of the Wishart ensemble. The proof

energy source in the diffuse ISM. Though on average smaller than the heating
rates due to cosmic rays and the photoelectric effect on dust grains, the
turbulent cascade can channel large amounts of energy into a relatively small
fraction of the gas that consequently undergoes significant heating and
chemical enrichment. In particular, this mechanism has been proposed as a
solution to the long-standing problem of the high abundance of CH+ along
diffuse molecular sight lines, which steady-state, low temperature models
under-produce by over an order of magnitude. While much work has been done on
the structure and chemistry of these small-scale dissipation zones,
comparatively little attention has been paid to relating these zones to the
properties of the large-scale turbulence. In this paper, we attempt to bridge
this gap by estimating the temperature and CH+ column density along diffuse
molecular sight-lines by post-processing 3-dimensional MHD turbulence
simulations. Assuming reasonable values for the cloud density (30 / cm^3), size
(20 pc), and velocity dispersion (2.3 km / s), we find that our computed
abundances compare well with CH+ column density observations, as well as with
observations of emission lines from rotationally excited H2 molecules.

widespread use of passive microparticle rheology. The mean-squared-displacement
(MSD) statistics of bead position time series (bead paths) are either applied
directly to determine the creep compliance [Xu et al (1998)] or transformed to
determine dynamic storage and loss moduli [Mason & Weitz (1995)]. A prevalent
hurdle arises when there is a non-diffusive experimental drift in the data.
Commensurate with the magnitude of drift relative to diffusive mobility,
quantified by a P\'eclet number, the MSD statistics are distorted, and thus the
path data must be ""corrected"" for drift. The standard approach is to estimate
and subtract the drift from particle paths, and then calculate MSD statistics.
We present an alternative, parametric approach using maximum likelihood
estimation that simultaneously fits drift and diffusive model parameters from
the path data; the MSD statistics (and consequently the compliance and dynamic
moduli) then follow directly from the best-fit model. We illustrate and compare
both methods on simulated path data over a range of P\'eclet numbers, where
exact answers are known. We choose fractional Brownian motion as the numerical
model because it affords tunable, sub-diffusive MSD statistics consistent with
typical 30 second long, experimental observations of microbeads in several
biological fluids. Finally, we apply and compare both methods on data from
human bronchial epithelial cell culture mucus.

Region Imaging Spectrograph. These jets appear to expand out along open
magnetic field lines rooted in unipolar network regions of coronal holes. In
this paper we revisit a thirty-year-old idea that spicules may be caused by
upward forces associated with Alfven waves. These forces involve the conversion
of transverse Alfven waves into compressive acoustic-like waves that steepen
into shocks. The repeated buffeting due to upward shock propagation causes
nonthermal expansion of the chromosphere and a transient levitation of the
transition region. Some older models of wave-driven spicules assumed sinusoidal
wave inputs, but the solar atmosphere is highly turbulent and stochastic. Thus,
we model this process using the output of a time-dependent simulation of
reduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The resulting mode-converted
compressive waves are strongly variable in time, with a higher transition
region occurring when the amplitudes are large and a lower transition region
when the amplitudes are small. In this picture, the transition region bobs up
and down by several Mm on timescales less than a minute. These motions produce
narrow, intermittent extensions of the chromosphere that have similar
properties as the observed jets and Type II spicules.

distribution becomes proportional to a large deviation rate function called the
quasi-potential. The quasi-potential, and its characterization through a
variational problem, lies at the core of the Freidlin-Wentzell large deviations
theory%.~\cite{freidlin1984}.In many interacting particle systems, the particle
density is described by fluctuating hydrodynamics governed by Macroscopic
Fluctuation Theory%, ~\cite{bertini2014},which formally fits within
Freidlin-Wentzell's framework with a weak noise proportional to $1/\sqrt{N}$,
where $N$ is the number of particles. The quasi-potential then appears as a
natural generalization of the equilibrium free energy to non-equilibrium
particle systems. A key physical and practical issue is to actually compute
quasi-potentials from their variational characterization for non-equilibrium
systems for which detailed balance does not hold. We discuss how to perform
such a computation perturbatively in an external parameter $\lambda$, starting
from a known quasi-potential for $\lambda=0$. In a general setup, explicit
iterative formulae for all terms of the power-series expansion of the
quasi-potential are given for the first time. The key point is a proof of
solvability conditions that assure the existence of the perturbation expansion
to all orders. We apply the perturbative approach to diffusive particles
interacting through a mean-field potential. For such systems, the variational
characterization of the quasi-potential was proven by Dawson and Gartner%.
~\cite{dawson1987,dawson1987b}. Our perturbative analysis provides new explicit
results about the quasi-potential and about fluctuations of one-particle
observables in a simple example of mean field diffusions: the
Shinomoto-Kuramoto model of coupled rotators%. ~\cite{shinomoto1986}. This is
one of few systems for which non-equilibrium free energies can be computed and
analyzed in an effective way, at least perturbatively.

(AdS) space seems to suggest that the stress tensor of the field theory dual
cannot be conserved. On the other hand, by symmetry arguments, it seems that
the dual should not violate Poincare symmetry. To clarify this apparent
contradiction, we study a holographic dual of massive gravity where both the
physical background metric and the fiducial metric are AdS. Using the anomalous
scaling of the energy momentum tensor as our guide, we conclude that the dual
theory is nonlocal. We find that the dual is similar to conformal invariant
""unparticle"" theories. We show that such theories can be viewed as dimensional
reductions of flat-space field theories with inhomogeneous scaling properties.

complex mechanisms in the ICM that drain energy from large-scales into
electromagnetic fluctuations in the plasma and collisionless mechanisms of
particle acceleration at much smaller scales. In this paper we focus on the
physics of acceleration by compressible turbulence. The spectrum and damping
mechanisms of the electromagnetic fluctuations, and the mean-free-path (mfp) of
CRe are the most relevant ingredients that determine the efficiency of
acceleration. These ingredients in the ICM are however poorly known and we show
that calculations of turbulent acceleration are also sensitive to these
uncertainties. On the other hand this fact implies that the non-thermal
properties of galaxy clusters probe the complex microphysics and the weakly
collisional nature of the ICM.

conjunction of parameter independence and outcome independence. It is commonly
believed that relativistic causality is equivalent to parameter independence,
which is satisfied by quantum mechanics. According to our approach, however,

including the measurement on the first particle. We define non-contextuality
based on preparation procedure and measurement process. Preparation-based
non-contextuality is an independent assumption, but non-locality within the

polymer being pulled through a nanopore by an external force acting at the
pore. Our theory is based on the tensile blob picture of Pincus in which the
front of the tensile force propagates through the backbone of the polymer, as
suggested by Sakaue and recently applied to study a completely flexible polymer
with self-avoidance, by Dubbledam et al. For a semi-flexible polymer with a
persistence length P , its statistics is self-avoiding for a very long chain.
As the local force increases, the blob size starts to decrease. At the blob
size P/a^2 , where a is the size of a monomer, the statistics becomes that of
an ideal chain. As the blob size further decreases to below the persistence
length P, the statistics is that of a rigid rod. We argue that semi-flexible
polymer in translocation should include the three regions: a self-avoiding
region, an ideal chain region and a rigid rod region, under uneven tension
propagation, instead of a uniform scaling picture as in the case of a
completely flexible polymer. In various regimes under the effect of weak,
intermediate and strong driving forces we derive equations from which we can
calculate the translocation time of the polymer. The translocation exponent is
given by \alpha=1+\mu, where \mu is an effective exponent for the end-to-end
distance of the semi-flexible polymer, having a value between 1/2 and 3/5,
depending on the total contour length of the polymer. Our results are of
relevance for forced translocation of biological polymers such as DNA through a

the time variation in the equation of state by a factor of two, and on the

baseline designs, changing: (i) the number of antenna stations; (ii) the number
of dipoles per station; and also (iii) the distribution of baseline lengths. We
find that a design with a reduced number of dipoles per core station (increased
field of view and total number of core stations), together with shortened
baselines, maximises the recovered EoR signal. With this optimal baseline
design, we investigate three observing strategies, analysing the trade-off
between lowering the instrumental thermal noise against increasing the field of
view. SKA1-low intends to perform a three tiered observing approach, including
a deep 100 deg$^{2}$ at 1000 h, a medium-deep 1000 deg$^{2}$ at 100 h and a
shallow 10,000 deg$^{2}$ at 10 h survey. We find that the three observing
strategies result in comparable ($\lesssim$ per cent) constraints on our EoR
astrophysical parameters. This is contrary to naive predictions based purely on
the total signal-to-noise, thus highlighting the need to use EoR parameter
constraints as a figure of merit, in order to maximise scientific returns with
next generation interferometers.

and electronic structure in virtually any type of material. The advent of
correlated electron systems, in particular complex oxides, brought about new
scientific challenges and opportunities for the advancement of conventional
x-ray methods. In this context, the need for new approaches capable of
selectively sensing new forms of orders involving all degrees of freedom --
charge, orbital, spin, and lattice -- paved the way for the emergence and
success of resonant x-ray scattering, which has become an increasingly popular
and powerful tool for the study of electronic ordering phenomena in solids.
Here we review the recent resonant x-ray scattering breakthroughs in the copper
oxide high-temperature superconductors, in particular regarding the phenomenon
of charge order -- a broken-symmetry state occurring when valence electrons
self-organize into periodic structures. After a brief historical perspective on
charge order, we outline the milestones in the development of resonant x-ray
scattering, as well as the basic theoretical formalism underlying its unique
capabilities. The rest of the review will focus on the recent contributions of
resonant scattering to the tremendous advancements in our description and
understanding of charge order. To conclude, we propose a series of present and
upcoming challenges, and discuss the future outlook for this technique.

populations. Here we present an analysis of the problem based on the
self-organizing map, a method of mapping the distribution of data in a
high-dimensional space and projecting it onto a lower-dimensional
representation. We apply this method to existing photometric data from the
COSMOS survey selected to approximate the anticipated Euclid weak lensing
sample, enabling us to robustly map the empirical distribution of galaxies in
the multidimensional color space defined by the expected Euclid filters.
Mapping this multicolor distribution lets us determine where - in galaxy color
space - redshifts from current spectroscopic surveys exist and where they are
systematically missing. Crucially, the method lets us determine whether a
spectroscopic training sample is representative of the full photometric space
occupied by the galaxies in a survey. We explore optimal sampling techniques
and estimate the additional spectroscopy needed to map out the color-redshift
relation, finding that sampling the galaxy distribution in color space in a
systematic way can efficiently meet the calibration requirements. While the
analysis presented here focuses on the Euclid survey, similar analysis can be
applied to other surveys facing the same calibration challenge, such as DES,
LSST, and WFIRST.

filaments made up of a network of smaller and coherent sub-filaments. Such
simulations resemble observations of filaments and fibres in nearby molecular
clouds. The sub-filaments are dynamical features formed at the stagnation
points of the turbulent velocity field where shocks dissipate the turbulent
energy. They are a ubiquitous feature of the simulated clouds, which appear
from the beginning of the simulation and are not formed by gradual
fragmentation of larger filaments. Most of the sub-filaments are
gravitationally sub-critical and do not fragment into cores, however, there is
also a significant fraction of supercritical sub-filaments which break up into
star-forming cores. The sub-filaments are coherent along their length, and the
residual velocities along their spine show that they are subsonically
contracting without any ordered rotation on scales of ~0.1 pc. Accretion flows
along the sub-filaments can feed material into star forming cores embedded
within the network. The overall mass in sub-filaments and the number of
sub-filaments increases as the cloud evolves. We propose that the formation of
filaments and sub-filaments is a natural consequence of the turbulent cascade
in the complex multi-phase interstellar medium. Sub-filaments are formed by the
high wavenumber, small scale modes in the turbulent velocity field. These are
then stretched by local shear motions and gathered together by a combination of
low wavenumber modes and gravitational contraction on larger scales, and by
doing so build up the extended filaments observed in column density maps.

Together with archival data from Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift-BAT, we perform
a high-quality broadband spectral analysis of the AGN over two decades in
energy ($\sim$0.5-100 keV). Previous X-ray observations suggested that the AGN
is obscured by a Compton-thick (CT) column of obscuring gas along our
line-of-sight. However, the lack of high-quality $\gtrsim$ 10 keV observations,
together with the presence of a nearby X-ray luminous source, NGC 5643 X-1, had
left significant uncertainties in the characterization of the nuclear spectrum.
NuSTAR now enables the AGN and NGC 5643 X-1 to be separately resolved above 10
keV for the first time and allows a direct measurement of the absorbing column
density toward the nucleus. The new data show that the nucleus is indeed
obscured by a CT column of $N_{\rm{H}}$ $\gtrsim$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$
cm$^{-2}$. The range of 2-10 keV absorption-corrected luminosity inferred from
the best fitting models is $L_{2-10,\rm{int}} =$ (0.8-1.7) $\times$ 10$^{42}$
erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with that predicted from multiwavelength intrinsic
luminosity indicators. We also study the NuSTAR data for NGC 5643 X-1, and show
that it exhibits evidence for a spectral cut-off at energy, $E$ $\sim$ 10 keV,
similar to that seen in other ULXs observed by NuSTAR. Along with the evidence
for significant X-ray luminosity variations in the 3-8 keV band from 2003-2014,
our results further strengthen the ULX classification of NGC 5643 X-1.

local obstruction, defined via the topology of a code's simplicial complex, and
proved that convex neural codes have no local obstructions. Curto et al. proved
the converse for all neural codes on at most four neurons. Via a counterexample

we classify all codes on five neurons with no local obstructions. This

related to maximal codewords (maximal sets of neurons that co-fire). Curto et

comparing the measurement statistics of a state before and after a small
unitary rotation. We argue that, in general, limited resolution of collective
observables prevents the detection of large QFI. This can be overcome by
performing an additional operation prior to the measurement. We illustrate the
power of this protocol for present-day spin-squeezing experiments, where the
same operation used for the preparation of the initial spin-squeezed state
improves the lower bound on the QFI by two orders of magnitude. We also
establish a connection to Leggett-Garg inequalities. We show how to simulate a
variant of the inequalities with our protocol and demonstrate that a large QFI
is necessary for their violation with coarse-grained detectors.

not explicitly represented, transmitted, or published with the final digital
painting. We propose a technique to decompose a digital painting into layers.
In our decomposition, each layer represents a coat of paint of a single paint
color applied with varying opacity throughout the image. Our decomposition is
based on the painting's RGB-space geometry. In RGB-space, a geometric structure
is revealed due to the linear nature of the standard Porter-Duff ""over"" pixel
compositing operation. The vertices of the convex hull of pixels in RGB-space
suggest paint colors. Users choose the degree of simplification to perform on
the convex hull, as well as a layer order for the colors. We solve a
constrained optimization problem to find maximally translucent, spatially
coherent opacity for each layer, such that the composition of the layers
reproduces the original image. We demonstrate the utility of the resulting
decompositions for re-editing.

J1745$-$2900 occurred on 2013-04-24. Enhanced radio emission is delayed with
respect to the X-ray peak by about seven months. In addition, the flux density
of the emission from the magnetar fluctuates by a factor of 2 to 4 at
frequencies between 21 and 41 GHz and its spectral index varies erratically.
Here we argue that the excess fluctuating emission from the magnetar arises
from the interaction of a shock generated from the X-ray outburst with the
orbiting ionized gas at the Galactic center. In this picture, variable
synchrotron emission is produced by ram pressure variations due to
inhomogeneities in the dense ionized medium of the Sgr A West bar. The pulsar
with its high transverse velocity is moving through a highly blue-shifted
ionized medium. This implies that the magnetar is at a projected distance of
$\sim0.1$ pc from Sgr A* and that the orbiting ionized gas is partially or
largely responsible for a large rotation measure detected toward the magnetar.
Despite the variability of Sgr A* expected to be induced by the passage of the

to separate circular curves into classes. This objective classification method
identifies four different classes, which we name slow-rising (SR), flat (FL),
round-peaked (RP) and sharp-peaked (SP) circular curves.
  SR are typical for low-mass, late-type (Sb-Sdm), young, faint, metal-poor and
disc-dominated galaxies. SP are typical for high-mass, early-type (E1-E7), old,
bright, metal-rich and bulge-dominated galaxies. FL and RP appear presented by
galaxies with intermediate mass, age, luminosity, metallicity, bulge-to-disk
ratio and morphologies (E4-S0a, Sa-Sbc). The discrepancy mass factor,
$f_d=1-M_{*}/M_{dyn}$, have the largest value for SR and SP classes ($\sim$ 74
per cent and $\sim$ 71 per cent, respectively) in contrast to the FL and RP
classes (with $\sim$ 59 per cent and $\sim$ 61 per cent, respectively).
Circular curve classification presents an alternative to typical morphological

employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is investigated
under the assumption of unknown frequency-selective fading channels and
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The classification problem is formulated as a
Bayesian inference task, and solutions are proposed based on Gibbs sampling and
mean field variational inference. The proposed methods rely on a selection of
the prior distributions that adopts a latent Dirichlet model for the modulation
type and on the Bayesian network formalism. The Gibbs sampling method converges
to the optimal Bayesian solution and, using numerical results, its accuracy is
seen to improve for small sample sizes when switching to the mean field
variational inference technique after a number of iterations. The speed of
convergence is shown to improve via annealing and random restarts. While most
of the literature on modulation classification assume that the channels are
flat fading, that the number of receive antennas is no less than that of
transmit antennas, and that a large number of observed data symbols are
available, the proposed methods perform well under more general conditions.
Finally, the proposed Bayesian methods are demonstrated to improve over
existing non-Bayesian approaches based on independent component analysis and on
prior Bayesian methods based on the `superconstellation' method.

semiring is a valuation semiring if and only if its ideals are totally ordered
by inclusion. We also prove that if the unique maximal ideal of a valuation
semiring is subtractive, then it is integrally closed. We end this paper by
introducing discrete valuation semirings and show that a semiring is a discrete
valuation semiring if and only if it is a multiplicatively cancellative
principal ideal semiring possessing a nonzero unique maximal ideal. We also
prove that a discrete valuation semiring is a Gaussian semiring if and only if

applications. In manipulator and legged robots, it can form the basis of an
effective nonlinear control strategy by providing a robot with both accurate
positional tracking and active compliance. In biomechanics applications,
inverse dynamics control can approximately determine the net torques applied at
anatomical joints that correspond to an observed motion.
  In the context of robot control, using inverse dynamics requires knowledge of
all contact forces acting on the robot; accurately perceiving external forces
applied to the robot requires filtering and thus significant time delay. An
alternative approach has been suggested in recent literature: predicting
contact and actuator forces simultaneously under the assumptions of rigid body
dynamics, rigid contact, and friction. Existing such inverse dynamics
approaches have used approximations to the contact models, which permits use of
fast numerical linear algebra algorithms. In contrast, we describe inverse
dynamics algorithms that are derived only from first principles and use
established phenomenological models like Coulomb friction.
  We assess these inverse dynamics algorithms in a control context using two
virtual robots: a locomoting quadrupedal robot and a fixed-based manipulator
gripping a box while using perfectly accurate sensor data from simulation. The
data collected from these experiments gives an upper bound on the performance
of such controllers in situ. For points of comparison, we assess performance on
the same tasks with both error feedback control and inverse dynamics control
with virtual contact force sensing.

recent low-cost and low-power consumption telecommunications standard. When
these signals are generated through a low-cost transmitter, the real modulation
index can end up being quite different from the nominal value employed at the
receiver and a significant performance degradation is observed, unless proper
techniques for the estimation and compensation are employed. For this reason,
we design new binary schemes with a much higher robustness. They are based on
the concatenation of a suitable precoder with binary input and a ternary CPM
format. The result is a family of CPM formats whose phase state is constrained
to follow a specific evolution. Two of these precoders are considered. We will
discuss many aspects related to these schemes, such as the power spectral
density, the spectral efficiency, simplified detection, the minimum distance,
and the uncoded performance. The adopted precoders do not change the recursive
nature of CPM schemes. So these schemes are still suited for serial
concatenation, through a pseudo-random interleaver, with an outer channel
encoder.

order to understand the effects of heterogeneous adoption thresholds
quantitatively, an edge-based compartmental theory is developed for the
proposed model. We use a binary spreading threshold model as a specific
example, in which some individuals have a low adoption threshold (i.e.,
activists) while the remaining ones hold a relatively high adoption threshold
(i.e., bigots), to demonstrate that heterogeneous adoption thresholds markedly
affect the final adoption size and phase transition. Interestingly, the
first-order, second-order and hybrid phase transitions can be found in the
system. More importantly, there are two different kinds of crossover phenomena
in phase transition for distinct values of bigots' adoption threshold: a change
from first-order or hybrid phase transition to the second-order phase
transition. The theoretical predictions based on the suggested theory agree
very well with the results of numerical simulations.

brightness by near-nucleus coma to $\leq$ 2.5 %. Assuming an albedo equal to
those typical of cometary nuclei ($\it p_{\rm R}$=0.04), we find that the

rotational period of 12.650$\pm$0.033 hr. The range of the lightcurve, $\Delta

colors slightly redder than the Sun, being comparable with those of C-type

with $T\simeq T_c$, $B_{c2}$ and $B_{c1}$ are strongly suppressed and can be
smaller than the ambient magnetic field, $B_a$. A region with $B_{c2}\le B_a$
is normal conducting, that with $B_{c1}\le B_a < B_{c2}$ is in the vortex
state, and that with $B_{c1}> B_a$ is in the Meissner state. As a material is
cooled down, these three domains including the vortex state domain sweep and
pass through the material. In this process, vortices contained in the vortex
state domain are trapped by pinning centers distributing in the material. A
number of trapped fluxes can be evaluated by using the analogy with the
beam-target collision event, where beams and a target correspond to pinning
centers and the vortex state domain, respectively. We find a number of trapped
fluxes and thus the residual resistance are proportional to the ambient
magnetic field and the inverse of the temperature gradient. The obtained
formula for the residual resistance is consistent with experimental results.
The present model focuses on what happens at the phase transition fronts during
a cooling down, reveals why and how the residual resistance depends on the
temperature gradient, and naturally explains how the fast cooling works.

spin diffusion length of the mixture. Our main qualitative finding is that,
when the bare spin diffusion length is much smaller than the radius of the
grain, the effective spin diffusion length is strongly enhanced, well beyond
the ""geometrical"" factor. The physical origin of this additional enhancement is
that, with small diffusion length, the spin current mostly flows around the
grain without suffering much loss. We also demonstrate that the voltage,
created by a spin current, is sensitive to a very weak magnetic field directed
along the spin current, and even reverses sign in a certain domain of fields.
The origin of this sensitivity is that the spin precession, caused by magnetic
field, takes place outside the grains where SO is absent.

periods to communicate efficiently, although may tolerate some delay variations
in short periods. This variability exhibits complex dynamics that makes rate
control of such applications a formidable task. This paper addresses rate
allocation for heterogeneous QoS-aware applications that preserves the
long-term end-to-end delay constraint while, similar to Dynamic Network Utility
Maximization (DNUM), strives to achieve the maximum network utility aggregated
over a fixed time interval. Since capturing temporal dynamics in QoS
requirements of sources is allowed in our system model, we incorporate a novel
time-coupling constraint in which delay-sensitivity of sources is considered
such that a certain end-to-end average delay for each source over a
pre-specified time interval is satisfied. We propose DA-DNUM algorithm, as a
dual-based solution, which allocates source rates for the next time interval in
a distributed fashion, given the knowledge of network parameters in advance.
Through numerical experiments, we show that DA-DNUM gains higher average link
utilization and a wider range of feasible scenarios in comparison with the
best, to our knowledge, rate control schemes that may guarantee such
constraints on delay.

the tunneling electron injection from the emitter, electron propagation across
the barrier layers with the partial capture into the GB, and the
self-consistent oscillations of the electric potential and the hole density in
the GB (plasma oscillations), as well as the quantum capacitance and the
electron transit-time effects. Using the proposed device model, we calculate
the responsivity of GB-HETs operating as THz detectors as a function of the
signal frequency, applied bias voltages, and the structural parameters. The
inclusion of the plasmonic effect leads to the possibility of the HET-GBT
operation at the frequencies significantly exceeding those limited by the
characteristic RC-time. It is found that the responsivity of GB-HETs with a
sufficiently perfect GB exhibits sharp resonant maxima in the THz range of
frequencies associated with the excitation of plasma oscillations. The
positions of these maxima are controlled by the applied bias voltages. The
GB-HETs can compete with and even surpass other plasmonic THz detectors.

devices enabling increased speed and energy efficiency for transmitting and

suggested Parity-Time (PT) symmetric photonic systems with alternating regions
of gain and loss can bring novel functionalities. In such systems, losses are
as important as gain and, depending on the structural parameters, gain
compensates losses. Generally, PT systems demonstrate nontrivial
non-conservative wave interactions and phase transitions, which can be employed
for signal filtering and switching, opening new prospects for active control of
light. In this review, we discuss a broad range of problems involving nonlinear
PT-symmetric photonic systems with an intensity-dependent refractive index.
Nonlinearity in such PT symmetric systems provides a basis for many effects
such as the formation of localized modes, nonlinearly-induced PT-symmetry
breaking, and all-optical switching. Nonlinear PT-symmetric systems can serve
as powerful building blocks for the development of novel photonic devices
targeting an active light control.

one-dimensional(1D) systems. The basis functions here are taken to be the
localized B-splines for the two finite non-periodic dimensions and the plane
waves for the third periodic direction. This approach will significantly reduce
the number of the basis and therefore is computationally efficient for the
diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. For 1D systems, B-spline
polynomials are particularly useful and efficient in two-dimensional spatial
integrations involved in the calculations because of their absolute
localization. Moreover, B-splines are not associated with atomic positions when
the geometry structure is optimized, making the geometry optimization easy to
implement. With such a basis set we can directly calculate the total energy of
the isolated system instead of using the conventional supercell model with
artificial vacuum regions among the replicas along the two non-periodic
directions. The spurious Coulomb interaction between the charged defect and its
repeated images by the supercell approach for charged systems can also be
avoided. A rigorous formalism for the long-range Coulomb potential of both
neutral and charged 1D systems under the mixed basis scheme will be derived. To
test the present method, we apply it to study the infinite carbon-dimmer chain,
graphene nanoribbon, carbon nanotube and positively-charged carbon-dimmer
chain. The resulting electronic structures are presented and discussed in

notion of a weak tropical complex in order to generalize the concepts of
divisors and the Picard group on graphs from Baker and Norine's paper
Riemann-Roch and Abel-Jacobi Theory on a Finite Graph. A tropical complex
$\Gamma$ is a $\Delta$-complex equipped with certain algebraic data. Divisors
in a tropical complex are formal linear combinations of ridges, and
piecewise-linear functions on a tropical complex give rise in a natural way to
divisors. Divisors that arise from PL-functions are called principal, and
divisors that are locally principal are called Cartier. Two divisors that
differ by a principal divisor are said to be linearly equivalent. The linear
equivalence classes of Cartier divisors on a tropical complex $\Gamma$ form a
group called the Picard group of $\Gamma$, by analogy to the definition of the
Picard group of a variety in algebraic geometry.
  Every graph has a unique tropical complex structure. If $G$ and $H$ are
graphs, and $\Gamma$ is a triangulation of their product, then $\Gamma$ has a
weak tropical complex structure that is compatible with the tropical complex
structures on $G$ and $H$. Thus, divisors on $\Gamma$ can be thought of as
states in a higher-dimensional chip-firing game on $\Gamma$. Cartwright
conjectured that the Picard groups of $\Gamma$, $G$, and $H$ were closely
related. Let $Pic(\Gamma)$ be the tropical Picard group of $\Gamma$, and
$Pic(G)$ and $Pic(H)$ be the tropical Picard groups of $G$ and $H$. Then, it
was conjectured that there is a map $\gamma: Pic(G) \times Pic(H) \to
Pic(\Gamma)$ that is always injective and is surjective if at least one of $G$
or $H$ is a tree.
  In this paper, we prove the conjecture. In preparation, we discuss some basic
properties of tropical complexes, along with some properties specific to the
product-of-graphs case.

the resulting coalescence. This phenomenon has been explained primarily by the

molecules induce random motion of individual droplets, causing accidental

this, we demonstrate that the droplet motion is not random, but
hydrodynamically driven by the composition Marangoni force due to an

Although it is known that magnetic fluxes lead to a Gaussian profile of
zero-modes on a torus and that can yield a suppressed coupling in
higher-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theories, the largest
(diagonal) entry of Yukawa matrices is always of $\mathcal O(1)$. In this
paper, we propose a way to induce an absolutely tiny global factor of Yukawa
matrices. In two SYM theories defined in different dimensional spacetime, their
bifundamental representations must be localized as a point in some directions.
Overlaps of such point-like localized wavefunctions and Gaussian zero-modes
give a global factor of Yukawa matrices, and it can be a strong suppression
factor or a usual $\mathcal O(1)$ factor, corresponding to their distance. Our
numerical analysis shows that it is possible to obtain a suppression strong
enough to realize the tiny neutrino masses without a hard fine-tuning.

  location of branch points in infinite set of sheets of Riemann surface","37 pages, 5 figures",,,,"nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stokes wave is a finite amplitude periodic gravity wave propagating with
constant velocity in inviscid fluid. Complex analytical structure of Stokes
wave is analyzed using a conformal mapping of a free fluid surface of Stokes
wave into the real line with fluid domain mapped into the lower complex
half-plane. There is one square root branch point per spatial period of Stokes
located in the upper complex half-plane at the distance $v_c$ from the real
axis. The increase of Stokes wave height results in approaching $v_c$ to zero
with the limiting Stokes wave formation at $v_c=0.$ The limiting Stokes wave
has $2/3$ power law singularity forming $2\pi/3$ radians angle on the crest
which is qualitatively different from the square root singularity valid for
arbitrary small but nonzero $v_c$ making the limit of zero $v_c$ highly
nontrivial. That limit is addressed by crossing a branch cut of a square root
into the second and subsequently higher sheets of Riemann surface to find
coupled square root singularities at the distances $\pm v_c$ from the real axis
at each sheet. The number of sheets is infinite and the analytical continuation
of Stokes wave into all these sheets is found together with the series
expansion in half-integer powers at singular points within each sheet. It is
conjectured that non-limiting Stokes wave at the leading order consists of the
infinite number of nested square root singularities which also implies the
existence in the third and higher sheets of the additional square root
singularities away from the real and imaginary axes. These nested square roots
form $2/3$ power law singularity of the limiting Stokes wave as $v_c$ vanishes.

  a supercooled metallic liquid","12 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The existence of a 'crossover region' in glass-forming liquids has long been
considered as a general phenomenon that is as important as the glass
transition. One potential origin for the crossover behavior is a
liquid-to-liquid phase transition (LLPT). Although a LLPT is thought to exist
in all forms of liquids, structural evidence for this, particularly in
supercooled liquids, is scarce, elusive, and in many cases controversial. A key
challenge to the search for a LLPT in a supercooled liquid is the interference
of crystallization during cooling. Crystallization induces major structural
changes, which can overwhelm and therefore mask the more subtle changes
associated with a LLPT. Here, we report the results of an in-situ containerless
synchrotron study of a metallic-glass-forming liquid (Zr57Nb5Al10Cu15.4Ni12.6)
that show distinct changes in the liquid structure at ~1000 K, a temperature
well below the melting temperature of the liquid and 150 K above the
crystallization temperature. The structural transition is characterized by
growing short- and extended-range order below the transition temperature, and
is accompanied by a concurrent change in density. These data provide strong
evidence for a LLPT in the supercooled metallic liquid, particularly in the
light of a recent computer simulation study. That a LLPT is found in a metallic
liquid supports the increasingly widely held view that a LLPT may be a common
feature of a variety of liquids.

master equations for quantum dynamics of a V-type system driven by weak
coupling to a thermal bath. We focus on noise-induced Fano coherences among the
excited states induced by incoherent driving of the V-system initially in the
ground state. For suddenly turned-on incoherent driving, the time evolution of
the coherences is determined by the damping parameter
$\zeta=\frac{1}{2}(\gamma_1+\gamma_2)/\Delta_p$, where $\gamma_i$ are the
radiative decay rates of the excited levels $i=1,2$, and
$\Delta_p=\sqrt{\Delta^2 + (1-p^2)\gamma_1\gamma_2}$ depends on the
excited-state level splitting $\Delta>0$ and the angle between the transition
dipole moments in the energy basis. The coherences oscillate as a function of
time in the underdamped limit ($\zeta\gg1$), approach a long-lived quasi-steady
state in the overdamped limit ($\zeta\ll 1$), and display an intermediate
behavior at critical damping ($\zeta= 1$). The sudden incoherent turn-on
generates a mixture of excited eigenstates $|e_1\rangle$ and $|e_2\rangle$ and
their in-phase coherent superposition $|\phi_+\rangle =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\bar{r}}}(\sqrt{r_1} |e_1\rangle + \sqrt{r_2}|e_2\rangle)$,
which is remarkably long-lived in the overdamped limit (where $r_1$ and $r_2$
are the incoherent pumping rates). Formation of this coherent superposition
{\it enhances} the decay rate from the excited states to the ground state. In
the strongly asymmetric V-system where the coupling strengths between the
ground state and the excited states differ significantly, we identify
additional asymptotic quasistationary coherences, which arise due to slow
equilibration of one of the excited states. Finally, we demonstrate that
noise-induced Fano coherences are maximized with respect to populations when
$r_1=r_2$ and the transition dipole moments are fully aligned.

and a two-stage detection for a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) phase-noise
channels is studied. Specifically, the phases of the QAM modulated data symbols
are manipulated before transmission in order to make them more immune to the
random rotational effects of phase noise. At the receiver, a two-stage detector
is implemented, which first detects the amplitude of the transmitted symbols
from a nonlinear combination of the received signal amplitudes. Then in the
second stage, the detector performs phase detection. The studied signaling
method does not require transmission of any known symbols that act as pilots.
Furthermore, no phase noise estimator (or a tracker) is needed at the receiver
to compensate the effect of phase noise. This considerably reduces the
complexity of the receiver structure. Moreover, it is observed that the studied
algorithm can be used for the setups where a common local oscillator or
separate independent oscillators drive the radio-frequency circuitries
connected to each antenna. Due to the differential encoding/decoding of the
phase, weighted averaging can be employed at a multi-antenna receiver, allowing
for phase noise suppression to leverage the large number of antennas. Hence, we
observe that the performance improves by increasing the number of antennas,
especially in the separate oscillator case. Further increasing the number of
receive antennas results in a performance error floor, which is a function of
the quality of the oscillator at the transmitter.

properties of CuSe2O5 at high magnetic fields which is a candidate for the
strong intra-chain interaction in quasi one-dimensional (1D) quantum magnets.
Magnetic behavior of the system can be described by the 1D spin-1/2 XXZ model
in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. Un- der these
circumstances, there is one quantum critical field in this compound. Below the
quantum critical field the spin chain system is in the gapless Luttinger liquid
(LL) regime, whereas above it one observes a crossover to the gapped saturation
magnetic phase. Indications on the thermodynamic curves confirm the occurrence
of such a phase transition. The main characteristics of the LL phase are
gapless and spin-spin correlation functions decay algebraic. The effects of
zero-temperature quantum phase transition are observed even at rather high
temperatures in comparison with the counterpart compounds. In addition, we
calculate the Wilson ratio in the model. The Wilson ratio at a fixed
temperature remains almost independent of the field in the LL region. In the
vicinity of the quantum critical field, the Wilson ratio increases and exhibits
anomalous enhancement.

  atmosphere","Paper has been withdrawn due to faulty data used in this study",,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rainfall in coastal areas of the tropics is often shaped by the presence of
circulations directly associated with the topography, such as land-sea and/or
mountain-valley breezes. In many regions the coastally-affected rainfall
consitutes more than half of the overall rainfall received. Weather and climate
models with parametrized convection produce large errors in rainfall in
tropical coastal regions, most commonly underestimating rainfall over land and
overestimating it over the ocean. Building on an algorithm to objectively
identify rainfall that is associated with land-sea interaction we investigate
whether the relationship between rainfall in coastal regions and the
large-scale atmosphere differs from that over the open ocean or over inland
areas. We combine 3-hourly satellite estimates of rainfall with estimates of
the large-scale atmospheric state from reanalyses. We find that when grouped by
rainfall intensity, medium-intensity coastal rainfall in the tropics occurs in
more stable conditions and drier atmospheres and is associated with less
large-scale convergence than its open-ocean and inland counterparts. Overall,
the dependence of the amount of rainfall on the large-scale state is
significantly weaker when the rainfall is coastally influenced. Our findings
indicate that the representation of convection in weather and climate models
must cater for the special character of the large-to-small scale relationship
near coasts rather than rely on a common set of rules across the globe.

very high on the agenda for future computation hardware. An approach to achieve
these would be to replace networks of transistors directly by classical
reversible logic gates built from the coherent dynamics of a few interacting
atoms. As superpositions are unnecessary before and after each such gate
(inputs and outputs are bits), the dephasing time only needs to exceed a single
gate operation time, while fault tolerance should be achieved with low
overhead, by classical coding. Such gates could thus be a spin-off of quantum
technology much before full-scale quantum computation. Thus motivated, we
propose methods to realize the 3-bit Toffoli and Fredkin gates universal for
classical reversible logic using a single time-independent 3-qubit Hamiltonian
with realistic nearest neighbour two-body interactions. We also exemplify how
these gates can be composed to make a larger circuit. We show that trapped ions

unusual temperature evolution of superconductivity: at $T_c^*=18$~K a partial
superconducting gap opens, as is evidenced by subtle, yet clear features in the
tunneling spectra, i.e. particle-hole symmetric coherence peaks, and a dip-hump
structure which signals strong-coupling superconductivity. At $T_c=16$~K, these
features substantiate dramatically and become characteristic of full
superconductivity. Remarkably, this is accompanied by an almost jump-like
increase of the gap energy at $T_c$ to about 87\% of its low-temperature gap
value. The energy of the bosonic mode as measured by the distance between the
coherence peak and the higher-energy dip remains practically constant in the

non-equilibrium dynamical states has attracted considerable attention not only
from the fundamental and application viewpoints but also as a model to
understand the occurrence of such phenomena in nature. These systems share
common features originating from their intrinsically out-of-equilibrium nature.
It remains elusive how energy dissipation affects the state selection in such
non-equilibrium states. As a simple model system, we consider a non-equilibrium
stationary state maintained by continuous energy input, relevant to industrial
processing of granular materials by vibration and/or flow. More specifically,
we experimentally study roles of dissipation in self-organization of a driven
granular particle monolayer. We find that the introduction of strong
inelasticity entirely changes the nature of the liquid-solid transition from
two-step (nearly) continuous transitions (liquid-hexatic-solid) to a strongly
discontinuous first-order-like one (liquid-solid), where the two phases with
different effective temperatures can coexist, unlike thermal systems, under a
balance between energy input and dissipation. Our finding indicates a pivotal
role of energy dissipation and suggests a novel principle in the
self-organization of systems far from equilibrium. A similar principle may
apply to active matter, which is another important class of out-of-equilibrium
systems. On noting that interaction forces in active matter, and particularly

spin dynamics such as renormalization of the precession frequency of the
carrier spins, which can reach values of several percent in CdMnTe quantum
wells. In two-dimensional systems, the precession frequency renormalization for
a single electron spin with defined wave vector shows logarithmic divergences
similar to those also known from the Kondo problem in metals. For smooth
electron distributions, however, the divergences disappear due to the
integrability of the logarithm. A possible dephasing mechanism caused by the

be of minor importance compared to the spin transfer from the carrier to the

turbid samples as a diffusion process, thereby making it possible to extract
the dynamics of scatterers from measured correlation functions. The analysis of
DWS data requires knowledge of the path length distribution of photons
traveling through the sample. While for flat sample cells this path length
distribution can be readily expressed in analytical form, no such expression is
available for cylindrical sample cells. DWS measurements have therefore
typically relied on dedicated setups that use flat sample cells. Here we show
how DWS measurements, in particular DWS-based microrheology measurements, can
be performed in standard dynamic light scattering setups that use cylindrical
sample cells. To do so we perform simple random walk simulations which yield
numerical predictions of the path length distribution as a function of both the
transport mean free path and the detection angle. This information is used in
experiments to extract the mean-square displacement of tracer particles in the
material, as well as the resulting frequency-dependent viscoelastic response.
An important advantage of our approach is that by measuring at different
detection angles, the average photon path length can be varied. Using a single
sample cell, this gives access to a wider range of length and time scales than
obtained in a conventional DWS setup. Such angle-dependent measurements also
offer an important consistency check, as for all detection angles the DWS
analysis should yield the same tracer dynamics, even though the respective path
length distributions are very different. We validate our approach by performing
measurements both on aqueous suspensions of tracer particles and on solid-like
gelatin samples, for which we find our DWS-based microrheology data to be in
excellent agreement with rheological measurements.

the order of 25-100 nm. The effective spring constant of the nanomeniscus
oscillated around its equilibrium position is determined by static and
frequency-modulation (FM) AFM modes. In the case of an unbounded meniscus, we
find that the effective spring constant k is proportional to the surface
tension {\gamma} of the liquid through k = (0.51 +- 0.06) {\gamma}, regardless
of the excitation frequency from quasistatic up to 450 kHz. A model based on
the equilibrium shape of the meniscus reproduces well the experimental data.
Electron microscopy allowed to visualize the meniscus profile around the fiber

is employed to compute the critical value of the multivariate test. We

the new testing procedures perform well even for small sample sizes and are
powerful in detecting local features or high-frequency components.

because a slowing down CA cannot be accommodated in most mainstream
cosmological models. In this work, by exploring the evolutionary trajectories
of dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ and deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we
present a comprehensive investigation on the slowing down of CA from both the
theoretical and the observational sides. For the theoretical side, we study the
impact of different $w(z)$ by using six parametrization models, and then
discuss the effects of spatial curvature. For the observational side, we
investigate the effects of different type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), different
baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and different cosmic microwave background
(CMB) data, respectively. We find that (1) The evolution of CA are insensitive
to the specific form of $w(z)$; in contrast, a non-flat Universe more favors a
slowing down CA than a flat Universe. (2) SNLS3 SNe Ia datasets favor a slowing
down CA at 1$\sigma$ confidence level, while JLA SNe Ia samples prefer an
eternal CA; in contrast, the effects of different BAO data are negligible. (3)
Compared with CMB distance prior data, full CMB data more favor a slowing down
CA. (4) Due to the low significance, the slowing down of CA is still a
theoretical possibility that cannot be confirmed by the current observations.

matrix. Random matrix theory enjoys many applications including sums and
products of random matrices. Typically ensembles with correlations among the
matrix elements are much more difficult to solve. Using a combination of
supersymmetry, superbosonisation and bi-orthogonal functions we are able to
determine all spectral k-point density correlation functions of H for arbitrary

is proportional to the identity, the recent results by Kumar for the joint
eigenvalue distribution of H serve as our starting point. In this case the
ensemble has a bi-orthogonal structure and we explicitly determine its kernel,
providing its exact solution for finite N. The kernel follows from computing
the expectation value of a single characteristic polynomial. In the general
non-degenerate case the generating function for the k-point resolvent is
determined from a supersymmetric evaluation of the expectation value of k
ratios of characteristic polynomials. Numerical simulations illustrate our
findings for the spectral density at finite N and we also give indications how
to do the asymptotic large-N analysis.

the phase shifts in the semiclassical limit. We analyze the distribution of
phase shifts, or equivalently, eigenvalues of the scattering matrix, $S_h(E)$,
for semiclassical Schr\""odinger operators on $\mathbb{R}^d$ which are
perturbations of the free Hamiltonian by a potential $V$ with polynomial decay.
Our assumption is that $V(x) \sim |x|^{-\alpha} v(\hat x)$ as $x \to \infty$,
for some $\alpha > d$, with corresponding derivative estimates. In the
semiclassical limit $h \to 0$, we show that the atomic measure on the unit
circle defined by these eigenvalues, after suitable scaling in $h$, tends to a
measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{S}^1$. Moreover, $\mu$ is the pushforward from
$\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R} / 2 \pi \mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{S}^1$ of a homogeneous
distribution $\nu$ of order $\beta$ depending on the dimension $d$ and the rate
of decay $\alpha$ of the potential function. As a corollary we obtain an
asymptotic formula for the accumulation of phase shifts in a sector of
$\mathbb{S}^1$.

that for a given near-horizon geometry there exists a finite dimensional moduli
space of infinitesimal transverse deformations. We then establish a uniqueness

we prove that the only smooth axisymmetric transverse deformation of the
near-horizon geometry of the extreme Kerr black hole, such that cross-sections
of the horizon are marginally trapped surfaces, corresponds to that of the
extreme Kerr black hole. Furthermore, we determine all smooth and

studied. Different parameter settings are studied where the system exhibits
bi-stable, tri-stable or mono-stable behavior on a finite-time horizon. It is
shown that, after a typically long transient, the system under investigation
exhibits no hysteretic behavior and that a unique steady state is reached,
independently of the initial conditions. The transient dynamics is marked out
by one or two well separated characteristic times, depending on the considered

technological extension of the process to the multilayer optics fabrication, it
would be convenient to overcoat the external surface of mandrels (normally in

dimethylamine (DMA) at mixing ratios of several parts per trillion by volume
can explain observed boundary layer new particle formation rates. However, the
concentration and molecular composition of the neutral (uncharged) clusters
have not been reported so far due to the lack of suitable instrumentation. Here
we report on experiments from the Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets chamber at
the European Organization for Nuclear Research revealing the formation of
neutral particles containing up to 14 SA and 16 DMA molecules, corresponding to
a mobility diameter of about 2 nm, under atmospherically relevant conditions.
These measurements bridge the gap between the molecular and particle
perspectives of nucleation, revealing the fundamental processes involved in
particle formation and growth. The neutral clusters are found to form at or
close to the kinetic limit where particle formation is limited only by the
collision rate of SA molecules. Even though the neutral particles are stable
against evaporation from the SA dimer onward, the formation rates of particles
at 1.7-nm size, which contain about 10 SA molecules, are up to 4 orders of
magnitude smaller comparedwith those of the dimer due to coagulation and wall
loss of particles before they reach 1.7 nm in diameter. This demonstrates that
neither the atmospheric particle formation rate nor its dependence on SA can
simply be interpreted in terms of cluster evaporation or the molecular
composition of a critical nucleus.

probabilistic processes. Roughly, coupling two processes requires finding an
appropriate witness process that models both processes in the same probability
space. Couplings are powerful tools proving properties about the relation
between two processes, include reasoning about convergence of distributions and
stochastic dominance---a probabilistic version of a monotonicity property.
  While the mathematical definition of coupling looks rather complex and
cumbersome to manipulate, we show that the relational program logic pRHL---the
logic underlying the EasyCrypt cryptographic proof assistant---already
internalizes a generalization of probabilistic coupling. With this insight,
constructing couplings is no harder than constructing logical proofs. We
demonstrate how to express and verify classic examples of couplings in pRHL,
and we mechanically verify several couplings in EasyCrypt.

grazing angles to enhance the reflectivity of reflective coatings. On the other
hand, to obtain large collecting area, large mirror diameters (< 350 mm) are
necessary. This implies that mirrors with focal lengths >10 m shall be produced
and tested. Full-illumination tests of such mirrors are usually performed with
on- ground X-ray facilities, aimed at measuring their effective area and the
angular resolution; however, they in general suffer from effects of the finite
distance of the X-ray source, e.g. a loss of effective area for double
reflection. These effects increase with the focal length of the mirror under
test; hence a ""partial"" full-illumination measurement might not be fully
representative of the in-flight performances. Indeed, a pencil beam test can be
adopted to overcome this shortcoming, because a sector at a time is exposed to
the X-ray flux, and the compensation of the beam divergence is achieved by
tilting the optic. In this work we present the result of a hard X-ray test

accuracy to which it is modelled limits the accuracy in any covariant
parameters of interest, such as the radius of a transiting planet. With the
ever growing availability of precise observations and the importance of robust
estimates of astrophysical parameters, an emerging trend has been to freely fit
the limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs) describing a limb-darkening law of
choice, in order to propagate our ignorance of the true intensity profile. In
practice, this approach has been limited to two-parameter limb-darkening laws,
such as the quadratic law, due to the relative ease of sampling the physically
allowed range of LDCs. Here, we provide a highly efficient method for sampling
LDCs describing a more accurate three-parameter non-linear law. We first derive
analytic criteria which can quickly test if a set of LDCs are physical,
although naive sampling with these criteria leads to an acceptance rate less
than 1%. We then show that the loci of allowed LDCs can be transformed into a
cone-like volume, from which we are able to draw uniform samples. We show that
samples drawn uniformly from the conal region are physically valid in 97.3% of

networks are important for many practical applications, such as the viral

network is a global process, it is commonly believed that measuring the
influence of nodes inevitably requires the knowledge of the entire network.
Employing percolation theory, we show that the spreading process displays a
nucleation behavior: once a piece of information spread from the seeds to more
than a small characteristic number of nodes, it reaches a point of no return
and will quickly reach the percolation cluster, regardless of the entire
network structure, otherwise the spreading will be contained locally. Thus, we
find that, without the knowledge of entire network, any nodes' global influence
can be accurately measured using this characteristic number, which is
independent of the network size. This motivates an efficient algorithm with
constant time complexity on the long standing problem of best seed spreaders
selection, with performance remarkably close to the true optimum.

ABC flows forced at different forcing wavenumbers $k_f$ simulated using a
subgrid turbulent model. The critical magnetic Reynolds number $Rm_c^T$
decreases as the forcing wavenumber $k_f$ increases from the smallest allowed

their kinetics and rheology; in particular, the velocity fluctuations and the

an instance, the electrons inside the Sun can generate a flavor-dependent

displacements with temperature micro-Raman and high resolution synchrotron
powder diffraction measurements were carried out. No increase of the width of
the (220) or (322) tetragonal diffraction peaks and microstrains could be found

hand, the atomic displacement parameters deviate from the expected behavior, in
agreement with modifications in the phonon width, as obtained by Raman
scattering. These deviations occur around 150 K for both F dopings, with
distinct differences among the two compounds, i.e., they decrease at low doping
and increase for the superconducting sample. The data do not support a hidden
phase transition to an orthorhombic phase in the superconducting compound, but
point to an isostructural lattice deformation. Based on the absence of magnetic
effects in this temperature range for the superconducting sample, we attribute
the observed lattice anomalies to the formation of local lattice distortions

means of a structural phase transition at low doping levels.

distribution of the events shows an excess at low latitudes |b|<10 degrees and
a deficit at high Galactic latitude |b|> 50 degrees. We use Monte-Carlo

stochastic GW background, which can be directly probed by measuring the timing
residuals of millisecond pulsars. In this paper, we investigate the constraints
on the RGWs and on the inflationary parameters by the observations of current
and potential future pulsar timing arrays. In particular, we focus on effects
of various cosmic phase transitions (e.g. $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation, QCD
transition and SUSY breaking) and relativistic free-streaming gases (neutrinos
and dark fluids) in the general scenario of the early Universe, which have been
neglected in the previous works. We find that the phase transitions can
significantly damp the RGWs in the sensitive frequency range of pulsar timing
arrays, and the upper limits of tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ increase by a factor
$\sim 2$ for both current and future observations. However, the effects of
free-steaming neutrinos and dark fluids are all too small to be detected.
Meanwhile, we find that, if the effective equation of state $w$ in the early
Universe is larger than $1/3$, i.e. deviating from the standard hot big bang
scenario, the detection of RGWs by pulsar timing arrays becomes much more
promising.

physical properties of a closed polymer loop that is wound around a rod.
Historically the preserved topology of this system has been addressed through
identification of similarities with magnetic systems. We treat the topological
invariance in terms of a set of rules that describe all augmentations by
additional arcs of some fundamental basic loop of a given winding number. These
augmentations satisfy the Reidemeister move relevant for the polymer with
respect to the rod. The topologically constrained polymer partition function is
now constructed using the combinatorics of allowed arc additions and their
appropriate statistical weights. We illustrate how, for winding number 1, we
can formally derive expressions for lower and upper bounds on the partition
function. Using the lower bound approximation we investigate a flexible polymer
loop wound between two slits, calculating the force on the slit as well as the
average numbers of arc types in dependence of slit width and separation.
Results may be extended to higher winding numbers. The intuitive nature of this
combinatoric scheme allows the development of a variety of approximations and
generalisations.

means of extensive direct numerical simulations, we investigate the statistical
distribution of particles as a function of the two dimensionless parameters of
the problem. We find that vertical confinement of particles is mainly ruled by
the degree of stratification, with a weak dependency on the particle
properties. Conversely, small scale fractal clustering, typical of inertial
particles in turbulence, depends on the particle relaxation time and is almost
independent on the flow stratification. The implications of our findings for
the formation of thin phytoplankton layers are discussed.

of a polydisperse granular chain composed of spherical beads of the same
material and with radii taken from a random distribution. We start by examining
the linear case, in which it is known that the energy transport strongly
depends on the type of initial conditions. Thus, we consider two sets of
initial conditions: i) an initial displacement and ii) an initial momentum
excitation of a single bead. After establishing the regime of sufficiently
strong disorder, we focus our studies on the role of nonlinearity for both sets
of initial conditions. By increasing the initial excitation amplitudes we are
able to identify three distinct dynamical regimes with different energy
transport properties: a near linear, a weakly nonlinear and a highly nonlinear
regime. Although energy spreading is found to be increasing for higher
nonlinearities, in the weakly nonlinear regime no clear asymptotic behavior of
the spreading is found. In this regime, we additionally find that energy,
initially trapped in a localized region, can be eventually detrapped and this
has a direct influence on the fluctuations of the energy spreading. We also
demonstrate that in the highly nonlinear regime, the differences in energy
transport between the two sets of initial conditions vanish. Actually, in this
regime the energy is almost ballistically transported through shock-like
excitations.

calculate the low-bias tunnel spectra of a Co adatom on the (001) and (111) Cu
surfaces with our density functional theory-based ab initio transport scheme
augmented by local correlations. In order to associate different $d$-orbitals
with different Fano line shapes we only correlate individual $3d$-orbitals
instead of the full Co $3d$-shell. We find that Kondo peaks arising in
different $d$-levels indeed give rise to different Fano features in the
conductance spectra. Hence the shape of measured Fano features allows to draw
some conclusions about the orbital responsible for the Kondo resonance,
although the actual shape is also influenced by temperature, effective
interaction and charge fluctuations. Comparison with a simplified model shows
that line shapes are mostly the result of interference between tunneling paths
through the correlated $d$-orbital and the $sp$-type orbitals on the Co atom.
Very importantly, the amplitudes of the Fano features vary strongly among
orbitals, with the $3z^2$-orbital featuring by far the largest amplitude due to
its strong direct coupling to the $s$-type conduction electrons.

test new algorithms or protocols in realistic environments. These often need to
be benchmarked against optimal/theoretical results obtained by running
commercial optimization solvers. The usual way to do this is to have the
simulator run in a standalone mode and generate (few) snapshots, which are then
fed to the optimization solvers. This allows one to compare the optimal and
suboptimal solutions in the snapshots, but does not allow to assess how the
system being studied would evolve over time if the optimal solution was
enforced every time. This requires optimization software to run directly in the
loop of the simulation, exchanging information with the latter. The goal of
this tutorial is to show how to integrate a commercial solver (CPLEX) into the
simulation loop of the OMNeT++ environment. For this purpose, we propose two
methods: a first one that uses a solver as an external program, and a second
one that exploits a C-written API for CPLEX known as Callable Library. We then
exemplify how to apply these two methods to SimuLTE, a simulation model for LTE
cellular networks, implementing and testing a simple solution to a well-known
resource-scheduling problem.

solar-type stars but the solar seismic sound speed stays puzzling since a
decade as it disagrees with the Standard Solar Model (SSM) prediction. One of
the explanations of this disagreement may be found in the treatment of the
transport of radiation from the solar core to the surface. As the same
framework is used for other stars, it is important to check precisely the
reliability of the interacting cross sections of photons with each species in
order to ensure the energy transport for temperature T > 2 - 10$^6$ K and
density $\rho$ > 0.2 g/cm$^3$. In this paper, we propose a new technique to
reach the domain of temperature and density found in the solar radiative
interior. This technique called the Double Ablation Front (DAF) is based on a
high conversion of the laser energy into X-rays thanks to moderated Z material
irradiated by laser intensity between 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ W/cm$^2$ and 4
$\times$ 10$^{15}$ W/cm$^2$. This high conversion creates, in addition to the
electronic front a second ablation front in the moderated Z material. Between
the two fronts there is a plateau of density and temperature that we exploit to
heat a sample of iron or of oxide. The first simulations realized with the
hydrodynamic code CHIC show that this technique allows to reach conditions
equivalent to half the radiative zone of the Sun with high stability both in
time and space. We examine the possibility to measure both iron and oxygen
absorption spectra.

(cosmological constant). Moreover, this background and its perturbations may
explain the temperature angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) obtained with WMAP (Wilkinson Map Anisotropy Probe), and other
observations, as e.g., the Ia supernova luminosities. The parametrized
post-Newtonian limit of the VT theory has been proved to be identical to that
of general relativity (GR), and there are no quantum ghosts and classical
instabilities. Here, the stationary spherically symmetric solution, in the
absence of any matter content, is derived and studied. The metric of this
solution is formally identical to that of the Reissner-Nordstr\""om-de Sitter
solution of GR, but the role of the electrical charge is played by a certain
quantity $\Gamma $ depending on both the vector field and the parameters of the
VT theory. The black hole and cosmological horizons are discussed. The radius
of the VT black hole horizon deviates with respect to that of the
Kottler-Schwarzschild-de Sitter radius. Realistic relative deviations depend on
$\Gamma $ and reach maximum values close to 30 per cent. For large enough
$\Gamma $ values, there is no any black hole horizon, but only a cosmological
horizon. The radius of this last horizon is almost independent of the mass
source, the vector field components, and the VT parameters. It essentially
depends on the cosmological constant value, which has been fixed by using
cosmological observational data (CMB anisotropy, galaxy correlations and so
on).

an extra degree of freedom, coming from the trace of the field equations. In
particular, the stiffness of the equation of state determines an upper limit on
the central density $\rho_c$ above which the the positivity condition of
energy-matter tensor trace $T^{\rm m}=\rho - 3 p$ holds. In the case of
quadratic f(R)-gravity, we find higher masses and radii at lower central

corrections, we find solutions converging to the required asymptotic behavior
of flat metric only for $\gamma < 0$. A similar analysis is performed for

number of studies in Chinese literature. However, quantitative investigations
about the evolutionary linkages of classical Chinese poetry are limited. The
primary goal of this study is to provide quantitative evidence of the
evolutionary linkages, with emphasis on character usage, among different period
genres of classical Chinese poetry. Specifically, various statistical analyses
are performed to find and compare the patterns of character usage in the poems
of nine period genres, including shi jing, chu ci, Han shi , Jin shi, Tang shi,
Song shi, Yuan shi, Ming shi, and Qing shi. The result of analysis indicates
that each of nine period genres has unique patterns of character usage, with
some Chinese characters that are preferably used in the poems of a particular
period genre. The analysis on the general pattern of character preference
implies a decreasing trend in the use of Chinese characters that rarely occur
in modern Chinese literature along the timeline of dynastic types of classical
Chinese poetry. The phylogenetic analysis based on the distance matrix suggests
that the evolutionary linkages of different types of classical Chinese poetry
are congruent with their chronological order, suggesting that character
frequencies contain phylogenetic information that is useful for inferring
evolutionary linkages among various types of classical Chinese poetry. The
estimated phylogenetic tree identifies four groups (shi jing, chu ci), (Han
shi, Jin shi), (Tang shi, Song shi, Yuan shi), and (Ming shi, Qing shi). The
statistical analyses conducted in this study can be generalized to analyze the
data sets of general Chinese literature. Such analyses can provide quantitative
insights about the evolutionary linkages of general Chinese literature.

in spatial games, with `memory-aware' agents, i.e., agents that accumulate
their payoff over time. In particular, we focus our attention on the spatial
Prisoner's Dilemma, as it constitutes an emblematic example of a game whose
Nash equilibrium is defection. Previous investigations showed that, under
opportune conditions, it is possible to reach, in the evolutionary Prisoner's
Dilemma, an equilibrium of cooperation. Notably, it seems that mechanisms like
motion may lead a population to become cooperative. In the proposed model, we
map agents to particles of a gas so that, on varying the system temperature,
they randomly move. In doing so, we are able to identify a relation between the
temperature and the final equilibrium of the population, explaining how it is
possible to break the classical Nash equilibrium in the spatial Prisoner's
Dilemma when considering agents able to increase their payoff over time.
Moreover, we introduce a formalism to study order-disorder phase transitions in
these dynamics. As result, we highlight that the proposed model allows to
explain analytically how a population, whose interactions are based on the
Prisoner's Dilemma, can reach an equilibrium far from the expected one; opening
also the way to define a direct link between evolutionary game theory and
statistical physics.

probability of} undesired events, in particular, system failures, caused by
various sources of uncertainties. In this work we consider the construction of
Gaussian {process} surrogates for failure detection and failure probability
estimation. In particular, we consider the situation that the underlying
computer models are extremely expensive, and in this setting, determining the
sampling points in the state space is of essential importance. We formulate the
problem as an optimal experimental design for Bayesian inferences of the limit
state (i.e., the failure boundary) and propose an efficient numerical scheme to
solve the resulting optimization problem. In particular, the proposed
limit-state inference method is capable of determining multiple sampling points
at a time, and thus it is well suited for problems where multiple computer
simulations can be performed in parallel. The accuracy and performance of the
proposed method is demonstrated by both academic and practical examples.

operating in transverse electromagnetic modes TEM$_{00}$ was used for the
synthesis of metal NPs. The Au,Ti Ni and Cu as well as Au-Ag and Au-Cu hybrid
metal NPs were formed in the liquid medium. Effectiveness of laser ablation in
the case of the biotissue sample that stained with the metal NPs was
approximately on 4-5 times larger than for the native sample. Also the scheme
of a laser point welding for the deep-located biotissue layer selectively
stained by the metal NPs has been demonstrated.

inverse Compton emission from electrons accelerated in the shock or in terms of
emission from hadrons accelerated in the same conditions. The latter might
reach much higher energies and could produce a second component in the
gamma-ray spectrum at TeV energies. We perform follow-up observations of
selected novae and dwarf novae in search of the second component in TeV energy
gamma rays. This can shed light on the acceleration process of leptons and
hadrons in nova explosions. We have performed observations with the MAGIC
telescopes of 3 sources, a symbiotic nova YY Her, a dwarf nova ASASSN-13ax and
a classical nova V339 Del, shortly after their outbursts. We did not detect TeV
gamma-ray emission from any of the objects observed. The TeV upper limits from
MAGIC observations and the GeV detection by Fermi constrain the acceleration
parameters for electrons and hadrons.

detection at VHE (VHE; E>100 GeV) for many years. It is powered by one of the
highest spin-down power pulsars known (5\% of Crab pulsar) and it has been
compared to the Crab Nebula due to its morphology. This object was previously
observed by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (Whipple, VERITAS and
MAGIC), and upper limit of 2.4\% Crab Unit (C.U.) at VHE. It was detected by
Fermi-LAT with a spectrum extending beyond 100 GeV. We analyzed 81 hours of 3C
58 data taken with the MAGIC telescopes and we detected VHE gamma-ray emission
with a significance of 5.7 sigma and an integral flux of 0.65\% C.U. above 1
TeV. We report the first significant detection of PWN 3C 58 at TeV energies.
According to our results 3C 58 is the least luminous VHE gamma-ray PWN ever
detected at VHE and the one with the lowest flux at VHE to date. We compare our
results with the expectations of time-dependent models in which electrons
up-scatter photon fields. The best representation favors a distance to the PWN
of 2 kpc and Far Infrared (FIR) comparable to CMB photon fields. If we consider
an unexpectedly high FIR density according to GALPROP, the data can also be
reproduced by models assuming a 3.2 kpc distance. A low magnetic field, far
from equipartition, is required to explain the VHE data. Hadronic contribution
from the hosting supernova remnant (SNR) requires an unrealistic energy budget
given the density of the medium, disfavoring cosmic ray acceleration in the SNR
as origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission.
