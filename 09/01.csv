landscape, but there are few metrics that measure the extent to which
reconnaissance is performed on phishing targets. Spear phishing emails closely
match the expectations of the recipient, based on details of their experiences
and interests, making them a popular propagation vector for harmful malware. In
this work we use Natural Language Processing techniques to investigate a
specific real-world phishing campaign and quantify attributes that indicate a
targeted spear phishing attack. Our phishing campaign data sample comprises 596
emails - all containing a web bug and a Curriculum Vitae (CV) PDF attachment -
sent to our institution by a foreign IP space. The campaign was found to
exclusively target specific demographics within our institution. Performing a
semantic similarity analysis between the senders' CV attachments and the
recipients' LinkedIn profiles, we conclude with high statistical certainty (p
$< 10^{-4}$) that the attachments contain targeted rather than randomly
selected material. Latent Semantic Analysis further demonstrates that
individuals who were a primary focus of the campaign received CVs that are
highly topically clustered. These findings differentiate this campaign from one
that leverages random spam.

two-dimensional system of coupled Hubbard chains at half-filling. In this
scenario emerging from variational cluster approximation and cluster dynamical
mean-field theory, the interchain hopping $t_{\perp}$ acts as a control
parameter driving the second-order critical end point $T_c$ of the
metal-insulator transition down to zero at $t_{\perp}^{c}/t\simeq 0.2$. Below
$t_{\perp}^{c}$, the volume of the hole and electron Fermi pockets of a
compensated metal vanishes continuously at the Mott transition. Above
$t_{\perp}^{c}$, the volume reduction of the pockets is cut off by a
first-order transition. We discuss the relevance of our findings to a putative
quantum critical point in layered organic conductors, whose location remains
elusive so far.

that form a screw-type pattern around a tetragonal $c$ axis. The spiral angle
$\theta$ was shown using neutron diffraction experiments to decrease with
pressure, and in later studies it was found to suffer a collapse to a
ferromagnetic state above a critical pressure, although the two separate
experiments did not agree on whether this phase transition is first or second
order. To resolve this contradiction, we use density functional theory
calculations to investigate the spiral state as a function of pressure, charge
doping, and also electronic correlations via a Hubbard-like $U$. We fit the
results to the one-dimensional $J_{1} - J_{2} - J_{3} - J_{4}$ Heisenberg
model, which predicts either a first- or second-order spiral-to-ferromagnetic
phase transition for different regions of parameter space. At ambient pressure,
MnAu$_{2}$ sits close in parameter space to a dividing line separating first-
and second-order transitions, and a combination of pressure and electron doping
shifts the system from the first-order region into the second-order region. Our
findings demonstrate that the contradiction in pressure experiments regarding
the kind of phase transition are likely due to variations in sample quality.
Our results also suggest that MnAu$_{2}$ is amenable to engineering via
chemical doping and to controlling $\theta$ using pressure and gate voltages,
which holds potential for integration in spintronic devices.

cloud to cloud and within regions of individual clouds; within the clouds, the
atomic gas per unit dust decreases by more than a factor of 3 compared to the
standard gas-to-dust ratio. Three hypotheses are considered. First, the
apparently low gas-to-dust ratio could be due to molecular gas. Comparing to
Planck CO maps, the brightest clouds have a H2/CO ratio comparable to galactic
plane clouds, but a strong lower limit is placed on the ratio for other clouds,
such that the required amount of molecular gas is far higher than would be
expected based on the CO upper limits. Second, we consider self-absorbed 21-cm
lines and find the optical depth must be approximately 3, significantly higher
than found from surveys of radio sources. Third, grain properties may change
within the clouds: they become more emissive when they are colder, while not
utilizing heavy elements that already have their cosmic abundance fully locked
into grains. It is possible all three processes are active, and follow-up
studies will be required to disentangle them and measure the true total gas and
dust content of interstellar clouds.

phenomenology of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), which are among the most
luminous explosions in the universe. Recent observations of long-lasting X-ray
afterglows of SGRBs challenge standard paradigms and indicate that in a large
fraction of events a long-lived neutron star (NS) may be formed rather than a
black hole. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these afterglows is
necessary in order to address the open questions concerning the nature of SGRB
central engines. However, recent theoretical progress has been hampered by the
fact that the timescales of interest for the afterglow emission are
inaccessible to numerical relativity simulations. Here we present a detailed
model to bridge the gap between numerical simulations of the merger process and
the relevant timescales for the afterglows, assuming that the merger results in
a long-lived NS. This model is formulated in terms of a set of coupled
differential equations that follow the evolution of the post-merger system and
predict its electromagnetic (EM) emission in a self-consistent way, starting
from initial data that can be extracted from BNS merger simulations and taking
into account the most relevant radiative processes. Moreover, the model can
accomodate the collapse of the remnant NS at any time during the evolution as
well as different scenarios for the prompt SGRB emission. A second major reason
of interest for BNS mergers is that they are considered the most promising
source of gravitational waves (GWs) for detection with the advanced
ground-based detector network LIGO/Virgo coming online this year.

minimum degree. In this paper, we obtain several new and tight results in this
area. Let $G$ be a graph with minimum degree at least $k+1$. We prove that if
$G$ is bipartite, then there are $k$ cycles in $G$ whose lengths form an
arithmetic progression with common difference two. For general graph $G$, we
show that $G$ contains $\lfloor k/2\rfloor$ cycles with consecutive even
lengths and $k-3$ cycles whose lengths form an arithmetic progression with
common difference one or two. In addition, if $G$ is 2-connected and
non-bipartite, then $G$ contains $\lfloor k/2\rfloor$ cycles with consecutive
odd lengths.
  Thomassen (1983) made two conjectures on cycle lengths modulo a fixed integer
$k$: (1) every graph with minimum degree at least $k+1$ contains cycles of all
even lengths modulo $k$; (2) every 2-connected non-bipartite graph with minimum
degree at least $k+1$ contains cycles of all lengths modulo $k$. These two
conjectures, if true, are best possible. Our results confirm both conjectures
when $k$ is even. And when $k$ is odd, we show that minimum degree at least
$k+4$ suffices. This improves all previous results in this direction. Moreover,
our results derive new upper bounds of the chromatic number in terms of the
longest sequence of cycles with consecutive (even or odd) lengths.

  Parallel Architectures",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the problem of binary distributed detection of a known
signal in correlated Gaussian sensing noise in a wireless sensor network, where
the sensors are restricted to use likelihood ratio test (LRT), and communicate
with the fusion center (FC) over bandwidth-constrained channels that are
subject to fading and noise. To mitigate the deteriorating effect of fading
encountered in the conventional parallel fusion architecture, in which the
sensors directly communicate with the FC, we propose new fusion architectures
that enhance the detection performance, via harvesting cooperative gain
(so-called decision diversity gain). In particular, we propose: (i) cooperative
fusion architecture with Alamouti's space-time coding (STC) scheme at sensors,
(ii) cooperative fusion architecture with signal fusion at sensors, and (iii)
parallel fusion architecture with local threshold changing at sensors. For
these schemes, we derive the LRT and majority fusion rules at the FC, and
provide upper bounds on the average error probabilities for homogeneous
sensors, subject to uncorrelated Gaussian sensing noise, in terms of
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of communication and sensing channels. Our
simulation results indicate that, when the FC employs the LRT rule, unless for
low communication SNR and moderate/high sensing SNR, performance improvement is
feasible with the new fusion architectures. When the FC utilizes the majority
rule, such improvement is possible, unless for high sensing SNR.

shape and dynamics of a Limit Order Book (LOB) arise endogenously from an
equilibrium between multiple market participants (agents). We use the proposed
modeling framework to analyze the effects of trading frequency on market
liquidity in a very general setting. In particular, we demonstrate the dual
effect of high trading frequency. On the one hand, the higher frequency
increases market efficiency, if the agents choose to provide liquidity in
equilibrium. On the other hand, it also makes markets more fragile, in the
sense that the agents choose to provide liquidity in equilibrium only if they
are market-neutral (i.e., their beliefs satisfy certain martingale property).
Even a very small deviation from market-neutrality may cause the agents to stop
providing liquidity, if the trading frequency is sufficiently high, which
represents an endogenous liquidity crisis (aka flash crash) in the market. This
framework enables us to provide more insight into how such a liquidity crisis
unfolds, connecting it to the so-called adverse selection effect.

found to induce an incommensurately modulated structural phase. The room
temperature X-ray and neutron powder diffraction patterns of this phase were
successfully refined using the Imma(0,0,g)s00 superspace group (g=0.534(3))
with the modulation applied to Bi/La- and oxygen displacements. The modulated
structure is closely related to the prototype antiferroelectric structure of
PbZrO3 which can be considered as the lock-in variant of the latter with g
=0.5. Below T_N = 220 K, the neutron diffraction data provide evidence for a
long-range G-type antiferromagnetic ordering commensurate with the average Imma

direction of the spins is controlled by the antisymmetric exchange imposed by
the two primary structural distortions, namely oxygen octahedral tilting and
incommensurate atomic displacements. The tilting is responsible for the onset
of a weak ferromagnetism, observed in magnetization measurements, whereas the
incommensurate displacive mode is dictated by the symmetry to couple a
spin-density wave. The obtained results demonstrate that antisymmetric exchange
is the dominant anisotropic interaction in Fe3+ based distorted perovskites
with a nearly quenched orbital degree of freedom.

hole. Unambiguous electromagnetic (EM) signatures of such a scenario would
strongly impact our knowledge on how short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and their

profound implications for multimessenger astronomy with joint EM and
gravitational-wave (GW) observations of BNS mergers, which will soon become
reality with the ground-based advanced LIGO/Virgo GW detector network starting
its first science run this year. Here we explore such EM signatures based on
the model presented in a companion paper, which provides a self-consistent
evolution of the post-merger system and its EM emission starting from an early
baryonic wind phase and resulting in a final pulsar wind nebula that is
confined by the previously ejected material. Lightcurves and spectra are
computed for a wide range of post-merger physical properties and particular
attention is paid to the emission in the X-ray band. In the context of SGRB
afterglow modeling, we present X-ray lightcurves corresponding to the
'standard' and the recently proposed 'time-reversal' scenario (SGRB prompt
emission produced at the time of merger or at the time of collapse of the
long-lived NS). The resulting afterglow lightcurve morphologies include, in
particular, single and two-plateau features with timescales and luminosities
that are in good agreement with the observations by the Swift satellite.
Furthermore, we compute the X-ray signal that should precede the SGRB in the
time-reversal scenario. If found, such a signal would represent smoking-gun
evidence for this scenario. Finally, we find a bright, highly isotropic EM

  In case the differentials have at least one pole (the strictly meromorphic

to the closure of the canonical divisors on nonsingular curves, the moduli

structure. As an abstract concept, we consider a tropicalization as a moduli
problem about extensions of a given valuation $v:k\to T$ between ordered
blueprints $k$ and $T$. If $T$ is idempotent, then we show that a
generalization of the Giansiracusa bend relation leads to a representing object
for the tropicalization, and that it has yet another interpretation in terms of
a base change along $v$. We call such a representing object a scheme theoretic
tropicalization.
  This theory recovers and improves other approaches to tropicalizations as we
explain with care in the second part of this text.
  The Berkovich analytification and the Kajiwara-Payne tropicalization appear
as rational point sets of a scheme theoretic tropicalization. The same holds
true for its generalization by Foster and Ranganathan to higher rank
valuations.
  The scheme theoretic Giansiracusa tropicalization can be recovered from the
scheme theoretic tropicalizations in our sense. We obtain an improvement due to
the resulting blueprint structure, which is sufficient to remember the
Maclagan-Rinc\'on weights.
  The Macpherson analytification has an interpretation in terms of a scheme
theoretic tropicalization, and we give an alternative approach to Macpherson's
construction of tropicalizations.
  The Thuillier analytification and the Ulirsch tropicalization are rational
point sets of a scheme theoretic tropicalization. Our approach yields a
generalization to any, possibly nontrivial, valuation $v:k\to T$ with
idempotent $T$ and enhances the tropicalization with a schematic structure.

types of users, but the greatest utility lies in finding the most influential
ones. The purpose of this article is to collect and classify the different
Twitter influence measures that exist so far in literature. These measures are
very diverse. Some are based on simple metrics provided by the Twitter API,
while others are based on complex mathematical models. Several measures are

Internet. Some others consider the timeline of publication, others the content

Furthermore, we include measures of activity and popularity, the traditional

gravity on a hypercubic lattice, as given by the Spin Foam model by Engle,

we restrict to a set of quantum geometries that reflects the large amount of
lattice symmetries. In particular, the sum over intertwiners is restricted to
quantum cuboids, i.e. coherent intertwiners which describe a cuboidal geometry
in the large-$j$ limit.
  Using asymptotic expressions for the vertex amplitude, we find several
interesting properties of the state sum. First of all, the value of coupling
constants in the amplitude functions determines whether geometric or
non-geometric configurations dominate the path integral. Secondly, there is a
critical value of the coupling constant $\alpha$, which separates two phases.
In both phases, the diffeomorphism symmetry appears to be broken. In one, the
dominant contribution comes from highly irregular, in the other from highly
regular configurations, both describing flat Euclidean space with small quantum
fluctuations around them, viewed in different coordinate systems. On the
critical point diffeomorphism symmetry is nearly restored, however.
  Thirdly, we use the state sum to compute the physical norm of kinematical
states, i.e. their norm in the physical Hilbert space. We find that states
which describe boundary geometry with high torsion have exponentially
suppressed physical norm. We argue that this allows one to exclude them from
the state sum in calculations.

range resolution resulting in high sampling rates at the receiver proportional
to the bandwidth of the transmit waveform. Analog processing techniques can be
used on receive to reduce the number of measurements to N, the number of
potential delay bins. If the scene interrogated by the radar is assumed to be
sparse consisting of K point targets, results from compressive sensing suggest
that number of measurements can be further reduced to scale with K logN for
stable recovery of a sparse scene from measurements with additive noise. While
unstructured random projectors guarantee successful recovery under sparsity
constraints, they cannot be implemented in the radar hardware in practice.
Recently, structured random Toeplitz and Circulant matrices that result from
using stochastic waveforms in time delay estimation setting have been shown to
yield recovery guarantees similar to unstructured sensing matrices. However,
the corresponding transmitter and receiver structures have high complexity and
large storage requirements. In this paper, we propose an alternative low
complexity compressive wideband radar sensor which combines multitone signal
chirp waveform on transmit with a receiver that utilizes an analog mixer
followed with a uniform sub-Nyquist sampling stage. We derive the recovery
guarantees for the resulting structured measurement matrix and sufficient
conditions for the number of tones. The only random component of our design is
the sparse tone spectrum implementable efficiently in hardware. Our analytical

sequence (MS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) objects in the star cluster NGC 2401.
The data sample several magnitudes fainter than previous studies, and a large
population of candidate PMS (cPMS) stars are identified. The cPMS stars are
traced out to 2.4 arcmin from the cluster center, and have a flatter spatial
distribution than the brightest MS stars near the cluster center. The
luminosity function of all MS and candidate PMS stars can be matched by a model
that assumes a solar neighborhood mass function, suggesting that NGC 2401 has
not yet shed significant numbers of members with masses in excess of 0.5 solar.
The frequency of wide binaries among the MS stars is ~3 times higher than among
the cPMS stars. It is argued that the difference in the spatial distributions
of MS and PMS objects is not the consequence of secular dynamical evolution or
structural evolution driven by near-catastrophic mass loss. Rather, it is
suggested that the different spatial distributions of these objects is the
fossil imprint of primordial sub-clustering that arises naturally if massive
stars form preferentially in the highest density central regions of a
protocluster.

is fast enrichment in the early Universe. Clear evidence for the chemical
enrichment of r-process elements is seen in the stellar abundances of extremely
metal poor stars in the Galactic halo. However, small-mass galaxies are the
ideal testbed for studying the evolutionary features of r-process enrichment
given the potential rarity of production events yielding heavy r-process
elements. Their occurrences become countable and thus an enrichment path due to
each event can be found in the stellar abundances. We examine the chemical
feature of Eu abundance at an early stage of ${\rm[Fe/H]} \lesssim -2$ in the
Draco and Sculptor dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. Accordingly, we constrain
the properties of the Eu production in the early dSphs. We find that the Draco
dSph experienced a few Eu production events, whereas Eu enrichment took place
more continuously in the Sculptor dSph due to its larger stellar mass. The
event rate of Eu production is estimated to be about one per $100$-$200$
core-collapse supernovae, and a Eu mass of $\sim (1-2) \times 10^{-5}$\ms per
single event is deduced by associating this frequency with the observed plateau
value of ${\rm [Eu/H]} \sim -1.3$ for ${\rm [Fe/H]} \gtrsim -2$. The observed
plateau implies that early Eu enrichment ceases at ${\rm [Fe/H]} \approx -2$.
Such a selective operation only in low-metallicity stars supports
magnetorotational supernovae, which require very fast rotation, as the site of
early Eu production. We show that the Eu yields deduced from chemical evolution
agree well with the nucleosynthesis results from corresponding supernovae
models.

lattice symmetry breaking phases. For weak interactions, the interplay between
two length scales, the lattice momentum and the spin-orbit wave-vector induce a
phase transition from a uniform superfluid to a phase where bosons
simultaneously condense at the center and edge of the Brillouin zone at a
non-zero spin-orbit strength. This state is characterized by spin density wave
order, which arises from the spin-$1$ nature of the system. Interactions
suppress spin density wave order, and favor a superfluid \textit{only} at the
Brillouin zone edge. This state has spatially oscillating mean field order
parameters, but a homogeneous density. We show that the spin density wave
superfluid phase survives in a two dimensional harmonic trap, and thus
establish that our results are directly applicable to experiments on $^{87}$Rb,

Differential Imaging (BDI), whereby two stars are imaged simultaneously at the
same wavelength within the isoplanatic patch at high Strehl ratio, offers
improved point spread function (PSF) subtraction that can result in increased
sensitivity to planets close to each star. We demonstrate this by observing a
young visual binary separated by 4\asec ~with MagAO/Clio-2 at 3.9 \microns,
where the Strehl ratio is high, the isoplanatic patch is large, and giant
planets are bright. Comparing BDI to angular differential imaging (ADI), we
find that BDI's 5$\sigma$ contrast is \about 0.5 mags better than ADI's within
\about 1\asec ~for the particular binary we observed. Because planets typically
reside close to their host stars, BDI is a promising technique for discovering
exoplanets in stellar systems that are often ignored. BDI is also 2-4$\times$
more efficient than ADI and classical reference PSF subtraction, since planets
can be detected around both the target and PSF reference simultaneously. We are
currently exploiting this technique in a new MagAO survey for giant planets in
140 young nearby visual binaries. BDI on a space-based telescope would not be
limited by isoplanatism effects and would therefore be an even more powerful
tool for imaging and discovering planets.

greatly increases the potential of voids as a tool for precision cosmology.
Given that voids are highly non-spherical and have most of their mass at their
edge, voids are better described relative to their boundary rather than
relative to their centre, as in the conventional spherical stacking approach.
The boundary profile is obtained by computing the distance of each volume
element from the void boundary. Voids can then be stacked and their profiles
computed as a function of this boundary distance. This approach enhances the
weak lensing signal of voids, both shear and convergence, by a factor of two
when compared to the spherical stacking method. It also results in steeper void
density profiles that are characterised by a very slow rise inside the void and
a pronounced density ridge at the void boundary. The resulting boundary density
profile is self-similar when rescaled by the thickness of the density ridge,
implying that the average rescaled profile is independent of void size. The
boundary velocity profile is characterized by outflows in the inner regions
whose amplitude scales with void size, and by a strong inflow into the
filaments and walls delimiting the void. This new picture enables a
straightforward discrimination between collapsing and expanding voids both for
individual objects as well as for stacked samples.

density profiles. Our sample consists of 26 galaxies evolving in the redshift
range $z=7-1$, spanning the stellar mass range $(0.2-6.4)\times 10^{10}M_\odot$
at $z=2$. We recover the main trends by stacking the profiles in accordance to
their evolution phases. Following a wet compaction event that typically occurs
when the stellar mass is $\sim10^{9.5}~M_{\odot}$ at $z\sim2-4$, the gas
develops a cusp inside the effective radius, associated with a peak in
star-formation rate (SFR). The SFR peak and the associated feedback, in the
absence of further gas inflow to the centre, marks the onset of gas depletion
from the central 1 kpc, leading to quenching of the central SFR. An extended,
star-forming ring that forms by fresh gas during the central quenching process
shows as a rising specific SFR (sSFR) profile, which is interpreted as
inside-out quenching. Before quenching, the stellar density profile grows
self-similarly, maintaining its log-log shape because the sSFR is similar at
all radii. During the quenching process, the stellar density saturates to a
constant value, especially in the inner 1 kpc. The stellar mass and SFR
profiles deduced from observations show very similar shapes, consistent with
the scenario of wet compaction leading to inside-out quenching and the
subsequent saturation of a dense stellar core. We predict a cuspy gas profile
during the blue nugget phase, and a gas-depleted core, sometimes surrounded by
a ring, in the post-blue nugget phase.

AGN, there is no significant correlation between the stacked 850um flux and
hard X-ray luminosity. However, in Type 2 AGN the stacked submm flux is a
factor of 2 higher at high luminosities. When averaging over all X-ray
luminosities, no significant differences are found in the stacked submm fluxes
of Type 1 and Type 2 AGN as well as AGN separated on the basis of X-ray
hardness ratios and optical-to-infrared colours. However, at log10(LX) >44.4,
dependences in average submm flux on the optical-to-infrared colours become
more pronounced. We argue that these high luminosity AGN represent a transition
from a secular to a merger-driven evolutionary phase where the star formation
rates and accretion luminosities are more tightly coupled. Stacked AGN 850um
fluxes are compared to the stacked fluxes of a mass-matched sample of K-band
selected non-AGN galaxies. We find that at 10.5<log10(M*/M0)<11.5, the non-AGN

suggest these differences are due to the presence of massive dusty, red

caused by weak gravitational lensing in the presence of much larger shape
distortions due to the point-spread function (PSF) has been widely
investigated. One major problem is that most galaxy shape measurement methods
are subject to bias due to pixel noise in the images (""noise bias""). Noise bias
is usually characterized using uncorrelated noise fields; however, real images
typically have low-level noise correlations due to galaxies below the detection
threshold, and some types of image processing can induce further noise
correlations. We investigate the effective detection significance and its
impact on noise bias in the presence of correlated noise for one method of
galaxy shape estimation. For a fixed noise variance, the biases in galaxy shape
estimates can differ substantially for uncorrelated versus correlated noise.
However, use of an estimate of detection significance that accounts for the
noise correlations can almost entirely remove these differences, leading to
consistent values of noise bias as a function of detection significance for
correlated and uncorrelated noise. We confirm the robustness of this finding to
properties of the galaxy, the PSF, and the noise field, and quantify the impact
of anisotropy in the noise correlations. Our results highlight the importance
of understanding the pixel noise model and its impact on detection
significances when correcting for noise bias on weak lensing.

scalar hair (KBHsSH). KBHsSH interpolate continuously between Kerr BHs and
boson stars (BSs), so we start by investigating the lensing of light due to
BSs. Moving from the weak to the strong gravity region, BSs - which by
themselves have no shadows - are classified, according to the lensing produced,
as: $(i)$ non-compact, which yield no multiple images; $(ii)$ compact, which
produce an increasing number of Einstein rings and multiple images of the whole
celestial sphere; $(iii)$ ultra-compact, which possess light rings, yielding an
infinite number of images with (we conjecture) a self-similar structure. The
shadows of KBHsSH, for Kerr-like horizons and non-compact BS-like hair, are
analogous to, but distinguishable from, those of comparable Kerr BHs. But for
non-Kerr-like horizons and ultra-compact BS-like hair, the shadows of KBHsSH
are drastically different: novel shapes arise, sizes are considerably smaller
and multiple shadows of a single BH become possible. Thus, KBHsSH provide
quantitatively and qualitatively new templates for ongoing (and future) very
large baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of BH shadows, such as those
of the Event Horizon Telescope.

Cosmological models predict the bulge to host the Galaxy's oldest stars for
[Fe/H]$\lesssim -1$, and this is demonstrated by RR Lyrae stars and globular
cluster observations. There is consensus that bulge stars with
[Fe/H]$\lesssim0$ are older than $t \approx10$ Gyr. However, at super-solar
metallicity, there is a substantial unresolved discrepancy. Data from
spectroscopic measurements of the main-sequence turnoff and subgiant branch,
the abundances of asymptotic giant branch stars, the period distribution of
Mira variables, the chemistry and central-star masses of planetary nebulae, all
suggest a substantial intermediate-age population ($t \approx 3$ Gyr). This is
in conflict with predictions from cosmologically-motivated chemical evolution
models and photometric studies of the main-sequence turnoff region, which both
suggest virtually no stars younger than $t \approx 8$ Gyr. A possible
resolution to this conflict is enhanced helium-enrichment, as this would shift
nearly all of the age estimates in the direction of decreasing discrepancy.
Enhanced helium-enrichment is also arguably suggested by measurements of the
red giant branch bump and the R-parameter.

1-8 Gyr), with the lower values associated with starburst events that occur at
infall through the virial radius or pericentric passages. We argue that such
starbursts together with the early assembly of cluster dwarfs can provide a
natural explanation for the higher specific frequency of globular clusters
(GCs) in cluster dwarfs, as found observationally. We present a simple model
for the formation and stripping of GCs that supports this interpretation. The
origin of dwarf ellipticals in clusters is, therefore, consistent with an
environmentally-driven evolution of field dwarf irregulars. However the z = 0
field analogs of cluster dwarf progenitors have today stellar masses a factor ~
3 larger --a difference arising from the early truncation of star formation in
cluster dwarfs.

the core of the Virgo cluster. We integrate this study with a detailed
structural analysis using imaging data from the Hubble and Spitzer space
telescopes, which allows us to perform a thorough investigation of the physical
properties of the galaxy. We show that the rotationally supported inner
components in NGC 4371, an inner disc and a nuclear ring - which, according to
the predominant scenario, are built with stars formed from gas brought to the
inner region by the bar - are vastly dominated by stars older than 10 Gyr. Our
results thus indicate that the formation of the bar occurred at a redshift of
about $z=1.8^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ (error bars are derived from 100 Monte Carlo
realisations). NGC 4371 thus testifies to the robustness of bars. In addition,
the mean stellar age of the fraction of the major disc of the galaxy covered by
our MUSE data is above 7 Gyr, with a small contribution from younger stars.
This suggests that the quenching of star formation in NGC 4371, likely due to
environmental effects, was already effective at a redshift of about
$z=0.8^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$. Our results point out that bar-driven secular evolution
processes may have an extended impact in the evolution of galaxies, and thus on
the properties of galaxies as observed today, not necessarily restricted to
more recent cosmic epochs.

and their far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs), we study the
variation in the FIR SEDs of a set of hydrodynamically simulated galaxies that
are generated by performing dust radiative transfer in post-processing. Our
sample includes both isolated and merging systems at various stages of the
merging process and covers infrared (IR) luminosities and dust masses that are
representative of both low- and high-redshift galaxies. We study the FIR SEDs
using principle component analysis (PCA) and find that 97\% of the variance in
the sample can be explained by two principle components (PCs). The first PC
characterizes the wavelength of the peak of the FIR SED, and the second encodes
the breadth of the SED. We find that the coefficients of both PCs can be
predicted well using a double power law in terms of the IR luminosity and dust
mass, which suggests that these two physical properties are the primary
determinants of galaxies' FIR SED shapes. Incorporating galaxy sizes does not
significantly improve our ability to predict the FIR SEDs. Our results suggest
that the observed redshift evolution in the effective dust temperature at fixed
IR luminosity is not driven by geometry: the SEDs of $z \sim 2-3$ ultraluminous
IR galaxies (ULIRGs) are cooler than those of local ULIRGs not because the
high-redshift galaxies are more extended but rather because they have higher
dust masses at fixed IR luminosity. Finally, based on our simulations, we
introduce a two-parameter set of SED templates that depend on both IR

of GX 339-4 down to the soft X-ray band, where the disc significantly
contributes to the total emission. At any luminosity probed, the disc in the
hard state is intrinsically more variable than in the soft state. However, the
fast decrease of disc variability as a function of luminosity, combined with
the increase of disc intensity, causes a net drop of fractional variability at
high luminosities and low energies, which reminds the well-known behaviour of
disc-dominated energy bands in the soft state. The peak-frequency of the
high-frequency Lorentzian (likely corresponding to the high-frequency break
seen in active galactic nuclei, AGN) scales with luminosity, but we do not find
evidence for a linear scaling. In addition, we observe that this characteristic
frequency is energy-dependent. We find that the normalization of the PSD at the
peak of the high-frequency Lorentzian decreases with luminosity at all
energies, though in the soft band this trend is steeper. Together with the
frequency shift, this yields quasi-constant high frequency (5-20 Hz) fractional
rms at high energies, with less than 10 percent scatter. This reinforces
previous claims suggesting that the high frequency PSD solely scales with BH
mass. On the other hand, this constancy breaks down in the soft band (where the
scatter increases to ~30 percent). This is a consequence of the additional
contribution from the disc component, and resembles the behaviour of optical
variability in AGN.

symmetry rather than global symmetries only. The consistency of the theory

not qualitatively higher. We discuss several ways to evade the above

few-TeV range (and therefore may be relevant for the little-hierarchy problem).

important as the overall level. To assess differences in intra-day time series,

Euclidean distance. To emphasize short-term variability, we examine the

model-dependent. While stellar interior and atmospheric theoretical models are
rapidly evolving, we need a powerful tool to test them. Open clusters are good
candidates for this role. We complement previous studies on the Hyades
multiplicity by Lucky Imaging observations with the AstraLux Norte camera. This
allows us to exclude possible binary and multiple systems with companions
outside 2--7 AU separation and to create a ""single-star sequence"" for the
Hyades. The sequence encompasses 250 main-sequence stars ranging from A5V to
M6V. Using the ""Tool for Astrophysical Data Analysis"" (TA-DA), we create
various theoretical isochrones applying different combinations of interior and
atmospheric models. We compare the isochrones with the observed Hyades
single-star sequence on J vs. J - K_s, J vs. J - H and K_s vs. H - K_s
color-magnitude diagrams. As a reference we also compute absolute fluxes and
magnitudes for all stars from X-ray to mid-infrared based on photometric
measurements available in the literature(ROSAT X-ray, GALEX UV, APASS gri,
2MASS JHK_s, and WISE W1 to W).We find that combinations of both PISA and
DARTMOUTH stellar interior models with BT-Settl 2010 atmospheric models
describe the observed sequence well. The full sequence covers the mass range
0.13 to 2.3 Msun, and effective temperatures between 3060 K and 8200 K. Within
the measurement uncertainties, the current generation of models agree well with
the single-star sequence. The primary limitations are the uncertainties in the
measurement of the distance to individual Hyades members, and uncertainties in
the photometry. Additionally, a small (~0.05 mag) systematic offset can be
noted on J vs. J - K and K vs. H - K diagrams - the observed sequence is
shifted to redder colors from the theoretical predictions.

a crucial role in identifying possible electromagnetic counterparts, and
thereby help usher in an era of GW multi-messenger astronomy. We discuss an
algorithm for accurate and very low latency ($<$ 1 second) localization of GW
sources using only the relative times of arrival, relative phases, and relative
signal-to-noise ratios for pairs of detectors. The algorithm is independent of
distances and masses to leading order, and can be generalized to all discrete
sources detected by ground-based detector networks. Our approach, while
developed independently, is similar to that of BAYESTAR with a few
modifications in the algorithm which result in increased computational
efficiency. For the LIGO two detector configuration (Hanford+Livingston)
expected in late 2015 we find a median 50\% (90\%) localization of 143 deg$^2$
(558 deg$^2$) for binary neutron stars (for network SNR threshold of 12,
corresponding to a horizon distance of $\sim 130$ Mpc), consistent with
previous findings. We explore the improvement in localization resulting from
high SNR events, finding that the loudest out of the first 4 (or 10) events
reduces the median sky localization area by a factor of 1.9 (3.0) for the case
of 2 GW detectors, and 2.2 (4.0) for 3 detectors. We consider the case of
multi-messenger joint detections in both the GW and the electromagnetic (EM)
spectra. We specifically explore the case of independent, and possibly highly
uncertain, localizations, showing that the joint localization area is
significantly reduced. We also show that a prior on the binary inclination,
potentially arising from GRB observations, has a negligible effect on GW
localization. Our algorithm is simple, fast, and accurate, and may be of
particular utility in the development of multi-messenger astronomy.

a growing interest in whether there could be a bifurcation associated with its
loss, and whether there is significant hysteresis associated with that
bifurcation. A challenge in answering this question is that the bifurcation
behavior of certain Arctic energy balance models have been shown to be
sensitive to how ice-albedo feedback is parameterized. We analyze an Arctic
energy balance model in the limit as a smoothing parameter associated with
ice-albedo feedback tends to zero, which introduces a discontinuity boundary to
the dynamical systems model. Our analysis provides a case study where we use
the system in this limit to guide the investigation of bifurcation behavior of
the original albedo-smoothed system. In this case study, we demonstrate that
certain qualitative bifurcation behaviors of the albedo-smoothed system can
have counterparts in the limit with no albedo smoothing. We use this
perspective to systematically explore the parameter space of the model. For
example, we uncover parameter sets for which the largest transition, with
increasing greenhouse gases, is from a perennially ice-covered Arctic to a
seasonally ice-free state, an unusual bifurcation scenario that persists even
when albedo-smoothing is reintroduced. This analysis provides an alternative
perspective on how parameters of the model affect bifurcation behavior. We
expect our approach, which exploits the width of repelling sliding intervals
for understanding the hysteresis loops, would carry over to other positive
feedback systems with a similar natural piecewise-smooth limit, and when the
feedback strength is likewise modulated with seasons or other periodic forcing.

estimate covariance matrices by computing a sample covariance of a large number
of mock catalogues. The next generation of galaxy surveys will require
thousands of large volume mocks to determine the covariance matrices to desired
accuracy. The errors in the inverse covariance matrix are larger and scale with
the number of P(k) bins, making the problem even more acute. We develop a
method of estimating covariance matrices using a theoretically justified,
few-parameter model, calibrated with mock catalogues. Using a set of 600 BOSS
DR11 mock catalogues, we show that a seven parameter model is sufficient to fit
the covariance matrix of BOSS DR11 P(k) measurements. The covariance computed
with this method is better than the sample covariance at any number of mocks
and only ~100 mocks are required for it to fully converge and the inverse
covariance matrix converges at the same rate. This method should work equally
well for the next generation of galaxy surveys, although a demand for higher
accuracy may require adding extra parameters to the fitting function.

classical, centralized and homogenous architectures into a mix of various
technologies, in which the network devices are densely and randomly deployed in
a decentralized and heterogenous architecture. This shift in network
architecture requires network devices to become more autonomous and,
potentially, cooperate with one another. Such cooperation can, for example,
take place between interfering small access points that seek to coordinate
their radio resource allocation, nearby single-antenna users that can
cooperatively perform virtual MIMO communications, or even unlicensed users
that wish to cooperatively sense the spectrum of the licensed users. Such
cooperative mechanisms involve the simultaneous sharing and distribution of
resources among a number of overlapping cooperative groups or coalitions. In
this paper, a novel mathematical framework from cooperative games, dubbed
\emph{overlapping coalition formation games} (OCF games), is introduced to
model and solve such cooperative scenarios. First, the concepts of OCF games
are presented, and then, several algorithmic aspects are studied for two main
classes of OCF games. Subsequently, two example applications, namely,
interference management and cooperative spectrum sensing, are discussed in

quantity $S_{CFT} + \frac{A(H_{B, \text{perturbed}})}{4G_{d}}$ is

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised metastatic liver tumour segmentation

First, the framework learns within-class and between-class similarity
distributions from a training set of images to discover the optimal manifold
discrimination between normal and pathological tissue in the liver. Second, a
conditional optimisation scheme computes nonlocal pairwise as well as
pattern-based clique potentials from the manifold subspace to recognise regions
with similar labelings and to incorporate global consistency in the
segmentation process. The proposed framework was validated on a clinical
database of 43 CT images from patients with metastatic liver cancer. Compared
to state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves a better performance on two
separate datasets of metastatic liver tumours from different clinical sites,
yielding an overall mean Dice similarity coefficient of 90.7 +/- 2.4 in over 50

efficient scheme for the shortcuts to the holonomic quantum computation (HQC).
It works in decoherence-free subspace (DFS) and the adiabatic process can be
speeded up in the shortest possible time. More interestingly, we give a
physical implementation for our shortcuts to HQC with nitrogen-vacancy centers
in diamonds dispersively coupled to a whispering-gallery mode microsphere
cavity. It can be efficiently realized by controlling appropriately the
frequencies of the external laser pulses. Also, our scheme has good scalability
with more qubits. Different from previous works, we first use TQDA to realize a
universal HQC in DFS, including not only two noncommuting accelerated
single-qubit holonomic gates but also a accelerated two-qubit holonomic
controlled-phase gate, which provides the necessary shortcuts for the complete
set of gates required for universal quantum computation. Moreover, our
experimentally realizable shortcuts require only two-body interactions, not
four-body ones, and they work in the dispersive regime, which relax greatly the
difficulty of their physical implementation in experiment. Our numerical
calculations show that the present scheme is robust against decoherence with
current experimental parameters.

on the web because of the openness of the Semantic Web. As such, RDF (Resource
Description Framework) triples described the same real-world entity can be
obtained from multiple sources; it inevitably results in conflicting objects
for a certain predicate of a real-world entity. The objective of this study is
to identify one truth from multiple conflicting objects for a certain predicate
of a real-world entity. An intuitive principle based on common sense is that an
object from a reliable source is trustworthy; thus, a source that provide
trustworthy object is reliable. Many truth discovery methods based on this
principle have been proposed to estimate source reliability and identify the
truth. However, the effectiveness of existing truth discovery methods is
significantly affected by the number of objects provided by each source.
Therefore, these methods cannot be trivially extended to resolve conflicts in
Linked Data with a scale-free property, i.e., most of the sources provide few
conflicting objects, whereas only a few sources have many conflicting objects.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called TruthDiscover to
identify the truth in Linked Data with a scale-free property. Two strategies
are adopted in TruthDiscover to reduce the effect of the scale-free property on
truth discovery. First, this approach leverages the topological properties of
the Source Belief Graph to estimate the priori beliefs of sources, which are
utilized to smooth the trustworthiness of sources. Second, this approach
utilizes the Hidden Markov Random Field to model the interdependencies between
objects to estimate the trust values of objects accurately. Experiments are
conducted in the six datasets to evaluate TruthDiscover.

Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg developed a derived version of this equivalence which

For $n$
elements and $m$ sets ($m\geq n$) we give a $O(1/\delta)$-pass algorithm with a
strongly sub-linear $\tilde{O}(mn^{\delta})$ space and logarithmic
approximation factor. This yields a significant improvement over the earlier
algorithm of Demaine et al. [DIMV14] that uses exponentially larger number of
passes. We complement this result by showing that the tradeoff between the
number of passes and space exhibited by our algorithm is tight, at least when
the approximation factor is equal to $1$. Specifically, we show that any
algorithm that computes set cover exactly using $({1 \over 2\delta}-1)$ passes
must use $\tilde{\Omega}(mn^{\delta})$ space in the regime of $m=O(n)$.
Furthermore, we consider the problem in the geometric setting where the
elements are points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and sets are either discs, axis-parallel
rectangles, or fat triangles in the plane, and show that our algorithm (with a
slight modification) uses the optimal $\tilde{O}(n)$ space to find a
logarithmic approximation in $O(1/\delta)$ passes.
  Finally, we show that any randomized one-pass algorithm that distinguishes
between covers of size 2 and 3 must use a linear (i.e., $\Omega(mn)$) amount of
space. This is the first result showing that a randomized, approximate
algorithm cannot achieve a space bound that is sublinear in the input size.
  This indicates that using multiple passes might be necessary in order to
achieve sub-linear space bounds for this problem while guaranteeing small
approximation factors.

cellular or reuse or dedicated mode), resource allocation (in cellular and
dedicated mode) and power control (in reuse mode) within a single framework.
The framework prioritizes D2D dedicated mode if the D2D pair are close to each
other and orthogonal resources are available. Otherwise, it allows D2D reuse
mode if the D2D satisfies both the maximum distance and an additional
interference criteria. For reuse mode, we present a geometric vertex search
approach to solve the power allocation problem. We analytically prove the
validity of this approach and show that it achieves near optimal performance.
For cellular and dedicated modes, we show that frequency sharing maximizes sum

demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework in terms of the

which some radical-power of smaller algebras is a one-sided ideal in bigger
algebras. Our results, however, are formulated more generally for an arbitrary
ideal: Let $B\subseteq A$ be an extension of Artin algebras and $I$ an ideal of

(1) If the extension is right-bounded (for example, proj.dim$(A_B)$ is finite),
$I A\, rad(B)\subseteq B$ and fin.dim$(A)$ is finite, then fin.dim$(B)$ is
finite. (2) If $I\, rad(B)$ is a left ideal of $A$ and $A$ is
torsionless-finite, then fin.dim$(B)$ is finite. Particularly, if $I$ is

consideration of both sequences. It extends the classic online subspace
tracking work which can be viewed as tracking of $x_t$ only. Our online
sufficient dimensionality reduction (OSDR) is a meta-algorithm that can be
applied to various cases including linear regression, logistic regression,
multiple linear regression, multinomial logistic regression, support vector
machine, the random dot product model and the multi-scale union-of-subspace
model. OSDR reduces data-dimensionality on-the-fly with low-computational
complexity and it can also handle missing data and dynamic data. OSDR uses an
alternating minimization scheme and updates the subspace via gradient descent
on the Grassmannian manifold. The subspace update can be performed efficiently
utilizing the fact that the Grassmannian gradient with respect to the subspace
in many settings is rank-one (or low-rank in certain cases). The optimization
problem for OSDR is non-convex and hard to analyze in general; we provide
convergence analysis of OSDR in a simple linear regression setting. The good
performance of OSDR compared with the conventional unsupervised subspace
tracking are demonstrated via numerical examples on simulated and real data.

diversification. However, there is is lack of solid understanding of how test
suites, programs and transformations interact one with another in this process.
We explore this intricate interplay in the context of a specific
diversification technique called ""sosiefication"". Sosiefication generates sosie
programs, i.e., variants of a program in which some statements are deleted,
added or replaced but still pass the test suite of the original program. Our
investigation of the influence of test suites on sosiefication exploits the
following observation: test suites cover the different regions of programs in
very unequal ways. Hence, we hypothesize that sosie synthesis has different
performances on a statement that is covered by one hundred test case and on a
statement that is covered by a single test case. We synthesize 24583 sosies on
6 popular open-source Java programs. Our results show that there are two
dimensions for diversification. The first one lies in the specification: the
more test cases cover a statement, the more difficult it is to synthesize
sosies. Yet, to our surprise, we are also able to synthesize sosies on highly
tested statements (up to 600 test cases), which indicates an intrinsic property
of the programs we study. The second dimension is in the code: we manually
explore dozens of sosies and characterize new types of forgiving code regions
that are prone to diversification.

frame, and then mean shift algorithm is applied to each feature separately to
find the center of ellipse related to that feature in the next frame. The
center of ellipse will be the weighted average of these centers. By using mean
shift actually we estimate the target movement between two consecutive frames.
Once the correct ellipsoid in each frame is known, in the second step we apply
the Dynamic Directional Gradient Vector Flow (DDGVF) version of active contour
models, in order to find the correct boundary of tumors. We sample a few points
on the boundary of active contour then translate those points based on the

galaxy, using tidal disruption as a diagnostic tool. Our study is based on a
series of numerical large particle number direct N-body simulations for dry
major mergers. According to the simulation results, the evolution can be
divided into three phases. In phase I, the tidal disruption rate for two well
separated SMBHs in merging system has similar level to single SMBH in isolate
galaxy. After two SMBHs getting close enough to form a bound binary in phase
II, the disruption rate can be enhanced for ~ 2 order of magnitudes within a
short time. This ""boosted"" disruption stage finishes after the SMBHB evolving
to compact binary system in phase III, corresponding to a drop back of
disruption rate to a level of a few times higher than that in Phase I. How to

effective cosmological term is described by a truncated power series of the
Hubble rate, whose dominant term is $\Lambda (H) \propto H^{n+2}$, is discussed
in detail. Specifically, by assuming that the ultra-relativistic particles
produced by the vacuum decay emerge into space-time in such a way that its
energy density $\rho_r \propto T^{4}$, the temperature evolution law and the
increasing entropy function are analytically calculated. For the whole class of
vacuum models explored here we findthat the primeval value of the comoving
radiation entropy density (associated to effectively massless particles) starts
from zero and evolves extremely fast until reaching a maximum near the end of
the vacuum decay phase, where it saturates. The late time conservation of the
radiation entropy during the adiabatic FRW phase also guarantees that the whole
class of running vacuum models predicts thesame correct value of the present
day entropy, $S_{0} \sim 10^{87-88}$ (in natural units), independently of the
initial conditions. In addition, by assuming Gibbons-Hawking temperature as an
initial condition, we find that the ratio between the late time and primordial
vacuum energy densities is in agreement with naive estimates from quantum field
theory, namely, $\rho_{\Lambda 0}/\rho_{\Lambda I} \sim10^{-123}$. Such results
are independent on the power $n$ and suggests that the observed Universe may
evolve smoothly between two extreme, unstable, nonsingular de Sitter phases.

dynamical systems is represented by the Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) theory. In
this approach the time evolution of a dynamical system is described in
geometric terms, treating the solution curves of a dynamical system by
geometrical methods inspired by the geodesics theory of Finsler spaces. In
order to geometrize the dynamical evolution one introduces a non-linear and a
Berwald type connection, respectively, and thus the properties of any dynamical
system are described in terms of five geometrical invariants, with the second
one giving the Jacobi stability of the system. The Jacobi (in)stability is a
natural generalization of the (in)stability of the geodesic flow on a
differentiable manifold endowed with a metric (Riemannian or Finslerian) to the
{\it non-metric} setting. Usually, the KCC theory is formulated by reducing the
dynamical evolution equations to a set of second order differential equations.
In this paper we present an alternative view on the KCC theory, in which the
theory is applied to a first order dynamical system. After introducing the
general framework of the KCC theory, we investigate in detail the properties of
the two dimensional autonomous dynamical systems. The relationship between the
linear stability and the Jacobi stability is also established. As a physical
application of the formalism we consider the geometrization of Hamiltonian
systems with one degree of freedom, and their stability properties.

provide examples of four schemas defined by different types of topological

that each schema provides its own large-scale characteristics of the
environment---the schema integrals. Moreover, we find that, in all cases, these
integrals are learned at a rate which is faster than the rate of complete
training of neural networks. Thus, the proposed schema framework differentiates
between the cognitive aspect of spatial learning and the physiological aspect
at the neural network level.

Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithms and DA pseudo-marginal MH algorithms can be

substituted for the true posterior in the MH acceptance ratio. Only for those
proposals which pass through the first stage is the computationally expensive
true posterior (or unbiased estimate thereof) evaluated, with a second
accept-reject stage ensuring that detailed balance is satisfied with respect to
the intended true posterior. In some scenarios there is no obvious
computationally cheap approximation. A weighted average of previous evaluations
of the computationally expensive posterior provides a generic approximation to
the posterior. If only the $k$-nearest neighbours have non-zero weights then
evaluation of the approximate posterior can be made computationally cheap

derived column densities of these species at the location of their emission

a primary driver of star formation over cosmic history. Except in very dense
environments where galaxy mergers are also important, model galaxies feed from
cold streams of gas from the web that penetrate their dark matter haloes.
Although these predictions are unambiguous, the observational support has been
indirect so far. Here we report spectroscopic evidence for this process in
extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPs) of the local Universe, taking the form of
localized starbursts associated with gas having low metallicity. Detailed
abundance analyses based on Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) optical spectra of
ten XMPs show that the galaxy hosts have metallicities around 60 % solar on
average, while the large star-forming regions that dominate their integrated
light have low metallicities of some 6 % solar. Because gas mixes azimuthally
in a rotation timescale (a few hundred Myr), the observed metallicity
inhomogeneities are only possible if the metal-poor gas fell onto the disk
recently. We analyze several possibilities for the origin of the metal-poor
gas, favoring the metal-poor gas infall predicted by numerical models. If this
interpretation is correct, XMPs trace the cosmic web gas in their surroundings,
making them probes to examine its properties.

  Recommendation with Multimedia Big Data in Social Networks",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rapid growth in multimedia services and the enormous offers of video
contents in online social networks, users have difficulty in obtaining their
interests. Therefore, various personalized recommendation systems have been
proposed. However, they ignore that the accelerated proliferation of social
media data has led to the big data era, which has greatly impeded the process
of video recommendation. In addition, none of them has considered both the
privacy of users' contexts (e,g., social status, ages and hobbies) and video
service vendors' repositories, which are extremely sensitive and of significant
commercial value. To handle the problems, we propose a cloud-assisted
differentially private video recommendation system based on distributed online
learning. In our framework, service vendors are modeled as distributed
cooperative learners, recommending videos according to user's context, while
simultaneously adapting the video-selection strategy based on user-click
feedback to maximize total user clicks (reward). Considering the sparsity and
heterogeneity of big social media data, we also propose a novel geometric
differentially private model, which can greatly reduce the performance
(recommendation accuracy) loss. Our simulation shows the proposed algorithms
outperform other existing methods and keep a delicate balance between computing
accuracy and privacy preserving level.

pores into smaller pieces, are known to produce wide variety of activity events
in solar active regions (ARs). It is also known that the light bridges appear
in the assembling process of nascent sunspots. The ultimate goal of this series
of papers is to reveal the nature of light bridges in developing ARs and the
occurrence of activity events associated with the light bridge structures from
both observational and numerical approaches. In this first paper, exploiting
the observational data obtained by Hinode, IRIS, and Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO), we investigate the detailed structure of the light bridge in NOAA AR
11974 and its dynamic activity phenomena. As a result, we find that the light
bridge has a weak, horizontal magnetic field, which is transported from the
interior by large-scale convective upflow and is surrounded by strong, vertical
fields of adjacent pores. In the chromosphere above the bridge, a transient
brightening occurs repeatedly and intermittently, followed by a recurrent dark
surge ejection into higher altitudes. Our analysis indicates that the
brightening is the plasma heating due to magnetic reconnection at lower
altitudes, while the dark surge is the cool, dense plasma ejected from the
reconnection region. From the observational results, we conclude that the
dynamic activity observed in a light bridge structure such as chromospheric
brightenings and dark surge ejections are driven by magnetoconvective evolution
within the light bridge and its interaction with surrounding magnetic fields.

in real time, for the currently operational bandwidths of 16 MHz and 32 MHz.
Provision has also been made to coherently dedisperse voltage beam data from

  We discuss the design and implementation of the real-time coherent

performance of the pipeline. Presently functioning on an Intel Xeon X5550 CPU
equipped with a NVIDIA Tesla C2075 GPU, the pipeline allows dispersion free,

significant improvements over the existing incoherent dedispersion system at
the GMRT, and present some preliminary results obtained from studies of pulsars
using this system, demonstrating its potential as a useful tool for low

  We describe the salient features of our implementation, comparing it with
other recently developed real-time coherent dedispersion systems. This

magnetic field which, depending on its strength, can influence the shape of the
bubble. We wish to investigate if, and how much, the interstellar magnetic
field can contribute to the shape of an expanding circumstellar bubble around a
massive star. We use the MPI-AMRVAC code to make magneto-hydrodynamical
simulations of bubbles, using a single star model, combined with several
different field strengths: B = 5, 10, and 20 muG for the interstellar magnetic
field. This covers the typical field strengths of the interstellar magnetic
fields found in the galactic disk and bulge. Furthermore, we present two
simulations that include both a 5 muG interstellar magnetic field and a 10,000
K interstellar medium and two different ISM densities to demonstrate how the
magnetic field can combine with other external factors to influence the
morphology of the circumstellar bubbles. Our results show that low magnetic
fields, as found in the galactic disk, inhibit the growth of the circumstellar
bubbles in the direction perpendicular to the field. As a result, the bubbles
become ovoid, rather than spherical. Strong interstellar fields, such as
observed for the galactic bulge, can completely stop the expansion of the
bubble in the direction perpendicular to the field, leading to the formation of
a tube-like bubble. When combined with a warm, high-density ISM the bubble is
greatly reduced in size, causing a dramatic change in the evolution of
temporary features inside the bubble. The magnetic field of the interstellar
medium can affect the shape of circumstellar bubbles. This effect may have
consequences for the shape and evolution of circumstellar nebulae and supernova
remnants, which are formed within the main wind-blown bubble.

59, 17 and 13 sources (66, 19 and 15 percent) are found to have outflows, show
some evidence of outflow, and have no evidence of outflow, respectively. The
time-dependent parameters of the high-velocity molecular flows are calculated
using a spatially variable dynamic timescale. The canonical correlations
between the outflow parameters and source luminosity are recovered and shown to
scale with those of low-mass sources. For coeval star formation we find the
scaling is consistent with all the protostars in an embedded cluster providing
the outflow force, with massive stars up to $\sim$30 M$_{\odot}$ generating
outflows. Taken at face value, the results support the model of a scaled-up
version of the accretion-related outflow-generation mechanism associated with
discs and jets in low-mass objects with time-averaged accretion rates of
$\sim$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ onto the cores. However, we also suggest
an alternative model, in which the molecular outflow dynamics are dominated by
the entrained mass and are unrelated to the details of the acceleration

driven by magnetconvective evolution. The aim of this second paper is to
investigate the detailed magnetic and velocity structures and the formation
mechanism of light bridges. For this purpose, we analyze numerical simulation
data from a radiative magnetohydrodynamics model of an emerging AR. We find
that a weakly-magnetized plasma upflow in the near-surface layers of the
convection zone is entrained between the emerging magnetic bundles that appear
as pores at the solar surface. This convective upflow continuously transports
horizontal fields to the surface layer and creates a light bridge structure.
Due to the magnetic shear between the horizontal fields of the bridge and the
vertical fields of the ambient pores, an elongated cusp-shaped current layer is
formed above the bridge, which may be favorable for magnetic reconnection. The
striking correspondence between the observational results of Paper I and the
numerical results of this paper provides a consistent physical picture of light
bridges. The dynamic activity phenomena occur as a natural result of the bridge
formation and its convective nature, which has much in common with those of
umbral dots and penumbral filaments.

symmetry-protected topological order, protected by a specific
$\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and the Ising phase has a

expressed by the magnetization exponent $0.12\pm0.01$. The symmetry-protected

show analytically and numerically that they belong to different classes. In

semimetals under the effect of the long-range Coulomb interaction, considering
the many-body theory of these electron systems as a variant of the conventional
fully relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). For this purpose, we apply
two different nonperturbative approaches, consisting in the sum of ladder
diagrams and taking the limit of a large number N of fermion flavors. We
benefit from the renormalizability that the theory shows in both cases to
compute the anomalous scaling dimensions of different operators exclusively in
terms of the renormalized coupling constant, allowing us to determine the
precise location of the singularities signaling the onset of the
strong-coupling phases. We show then that the QED of 3D Dirac semimetals has
two competing effects at strong coupling. One of them is the tendency to chiral
symmetry breaking and dynamical mass generation, which are analogous to the
same phenomena arising in the conventional QED at strong coupling. This trend
is however outweighed by the strong suppression of electron quasiparticles that
takes place at large N, leading to a different type of critical point at
sufficiently large interaction strength, shared also by the 3D Weyl semimetals.
Overall, the phase diagram of the 3D Dirac semimetals turns out to be richer
than that of their 2D counterparts, displaying a transition to a phase with
non-Fermi liquid behavior which may be observed in materials hosting a
sufficiently large number of Dirac or Weyl points.

product states (MPS-LCC) which provides remarkably accurate ground-state
energies, at a computational cost that has the same scaling as multireference
configuration interaction singles and doubles (MRCISD), for a wide variety of
electronic Hamiltonians. These range from first-row dimers at equilibrium and
stretched geometries, to highly multireference systems such as the chromium
dimer and lattice models such as periodic two-dimensional 1-band and 3-band
Hubbard models. The MPS-LCC theory shows a speed up of several orders of
magnitude over the usual DMRG algorithm while delivering energies in excellent
agreement with converged DMRG calculations. Also, in all the benchmark
calculations presented here MPS-LCC outperformed the commonly used
multi-reference quantum chemistry methods in some cases giving energies in
excess of an order of magnitude more accurate. As a size-extensive method that
can treat large active spaces, MPS-LCC opens up the use of multireference
quantum chemical techniques in strongly-correlated \emph{ab-initio}
Hamiltonians, including two and three-dimensional solids.

through the CIGALE code, is used to explore the redshift dependence of the

This parameter relates galaxy distribution to the one of the underlying dark

$z_{med}\sim 0.25$, $z_{med}\sim 0.9$. Measurements of total infrared
luminosities ($L_{TIR}$) show that the sample at $z_{med}\sim 0.25$ is composed
mostly of local star-forming galaxies, while the sample at $z_{med}\sim0.9$ is
composed of luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) with $L_{TIR}\sim
10^{11.62}L_{\odot}$. We find that dark halo mass is not necessarily correlated
with the $L_{TIR}$: for subsamples with $L_{TIR}= 10^{11.15} L_{\odot}$ at

to very high energies and also at different energies as the possibility of
varying the electron beam energy is assumed; this could have synergy with
cosmic-ray physics. Other physics which can be pursued at such a collider are
contact interaction searches, such as quark and electron substructure, and
measurements of the proton structure as well as other more conventional
measurements of QCD at high energies and in a new kinematic regime. The events
at very low $x$ will lead to electrons and the hadronic final state produced at
very low angles and so a novel spectrometer device will be needed to measure
these. First ideas of the physics programme of such a collider are given.

monochromator (SGM) beamline at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Source (LNLS)
in Campinas, Brazil. In-situ analyses were performed by a Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. Sample processing revealed the formation of
several organic molecules, including nitriles, acids, and other compounds such
as H2O2, H3O+, SO3, CO, and OCN-. The dissociation cross section of parental
species was in the order of 2-7E-18 cm2. The ice temperature seems not to
affect the stability for SO2 in the presence of X-rays. Formation cross
sections of produced new species were also determined. Molecular half-lives at
ices towards YSOs due to the presence of incoming soft X-rays were estimated.
The low obtained values, employing two different models of radiation field of
YSOs (TW Hydra and typical T Tauri star), reinforce that soft X-rays are indeed
a very efficient source of molecular dissociation in such environments.

  Protection","29th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium (Full Version)",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An adversary who has obtained the cryptographic hash of a user's password can
mount an offline attack to crack the password by comparing this hash value with
the cryptographic hashes of likely password guesses. This offline attacker is
limited only by the resources he is willing to invest to crack the password.
Key-stretching tools can help mitigate the threat of offline attacks by making
each password guess more expensive for the adversary to verify. However,
key-stretching increases authentication costs for a legitimate authentication
server. We introduce a novel Stackelberg game model which captures the
essential elements of this interaction between a defender and an offline
attacker. We then introduce Cost Asymmetric Secure Hash (CASH), a randomized
key-stretching mechanism that minimizes the fraction of passwords that would be
cracked by a rational offline attacker without increasing amortized
authentication costs for the legitimate authentication server. CASH is
motivated by the observation that the legitimate authentication server will
typically run the authentication procedure to verify a correct password, while
an offline adversary will typically use incorrect password guesses. By using
randomization we can ensure that the amortized cost of running CASH to verify a
correct password guess is significantly smaller than the cost of rejecting an
incorrect password. Using our Stackelberg game framework we can quantify the
quality of the underlying CASH running time distribution in terms of the
fraction of passwords that a rational offline adversary would crack. We provide
an efficient algorithm to compute high quality CASH distributions for the
defender. Finally, we analyze CASH using empirical data from two large scale
password frequency datasets. Our analysis shows that CASH can significantly
reduce (up to $50\%$) the fraction of password cracked by a rational offline
adversary.

are powerful tools used to describe many properties of nuclei in the entirety
of the nuclear chart. The accuracy required on energies for nuclear physics and
astrophysics applications is of the order of 500 keV and much effort is
undertaken to build EDFs that meet this requirement.
  Purpose: The mean-field calculations have to be accurate enough in order to
preserve the accuracy of the EDF. We study this numerical accuracy in detail
for a specific numerical choice of representation for the mean-field equations
that can accommodate any kind of symmetry breaking.
  Method: The method that we use is a particular implementation of
3-dimensional mesh calculations. Its numerical accuracy is governed by three
main factors: the size of the box in which the nucleus is confined, the way
numerical derivatives are calculated and the distance between the points on the
mesh. Results: We have examined the dependence of the results on these three
factors for spherical doubly-magic nuclei, neutron-rich $^{34}$Ne, the fission
barrier of $^{240}$Pu and isotopic chains around Z = 50.
  Conclusions: Mesh calculations offer the user extensive control over the
numerical accuracy of the solution scheme. By making appropriate choices for
the numerical scheme the achievable accuracy is well below the model
uncertainties of mean-field methods.

theory for (generally) multivariate time series with heavy tails. We make this
notion precise by introducing regularly varying time series. We provide general
large deviation results for functionals acting on a sample path and vanishing
in some neighborhood of the origin. We study a variety of such functionals,
including large deviations of random walks, their suprema, the ruin functional,
and further derive weak limit theory for maxima, point processes, cluster
functionals and the tail empirical process. One of the main results of this
paper concerns bounds for the ruin probability in various heavy-tailed models
including GARCH, stochastic volatility models and solutions to stochastic
recurrence equations. 1. Preliminaries and basic motivation In the last
decades, a lot of efforts has been put into the understanding of limit theory
for dependent sequences, including Markov chains (Meyn and Tweedie [42]),
weakly dependent sequences (Dedecker et al. [21]), long-range dependent
sequences (Doukhan et al. [23], Samorodnitsky [54]), empirical processes
(Dehling et al. [22]) and more general structures (Eberlein and Taqqu [25]), to
name a few references. A smaller part of the theory was devoted to limit theory
under extremal dependence for point processes, maxima, partial sums, tail
empirical processes. Resnick [49, 50] started a systematic study of the
relations between the convergence of point processes, sums and maxima, see also
Resnick [51] for a recent account. He advocated the use of multivariate regular
variation as a flexible tool to describe heavy-tail phenomena combined with
advanced continuous mapping techniques. For example, maxima and sums are
understood as functionals acting on an underlying point process, if the point
process converges these functionals converge as well and their limits are
described in terms of the points of the limiting point process. Davis and Hsing
[13] recognized the power of this approach for limit theory of point processes,
maxima, sums, and large deviations for dependent regularly varying processes,
i.e., stationary sequences whose finite-dimensional distributions are regularly
varying with the same index. Before [13], limit theory for particular regularly
varying stationary sequences was studied for the sample mean, maxima, sample
autocovariance and autocorrelation functions of linear and bilinear processes
with iid regularly varying noise and extreme value theory was considered for
regularly varying ARCH processes and solutions to stochastic recurrence

EDS mass fractions are close to the reference values. The dispersion of the

exception with the case of boron because at the lowest voltage, the excitation
condition is more favourable for the production of the K line. It appears that
the dispersion of the results is larger with EDS than with WDS but it was not
possible to find a correlation between the large dispersion and one of the

think that electron microprobes are inherently better for the determination of

is readily deployable on commodity hardware. AMON examines all packets,
partitions traffic into sub-streams by using rapid hashing and computes certain
real-time data products. The resulting data structures provide views of the
intensity and connectivity structure of network traffic at the time-scale of
routing. The proposed integrated framework includes modules for the
identification of heavy-hitters as well as for visualization and statistical
detection at the time-of-onset of high impact events such as DDoS. This allows
operators to quickly visualize and diagnose attacks, and limit offline and time
consuming post-mortem analysis. We demonstrate our system in the context of
real-world attack incidents, and validate it against state-of-the-art

the nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 in 2013-14. The source appeared unusually
heavily absorbed in the soft X-rays, and signatures of outflowing absorption
were also present in the UV. He-like triplets of neon, oxygen and nitrogen, and
radiative recombination continuum (RRC) features were found to dominate the
soft X-ray spectrum due to the low continuum flux.
  Aims. Here we focus on characterising these narrow emission features using
data obtained from the XMM-Newton RGS (770 ks stacked spectrum).
  Methods. We use SPEX for our initial analysis of these features.
Self-consistent photoionisation models from Cloudy are then compared with the
data to characterise the physical conditions of the emitting region.
  Results. Outflow velocity discrepancies within the O VII triplet lines can be
explained if the X-ray narrow-line region (NLR) in NGC 5548 is absorbed by at
least one of the six warm absorber components found by previous analyses. The
RRCs allow us to directly calculate a temperature of the emitting gas of a few
eV ($\sim10^{4}$ K), favouring photoionised conditions. We fit the data with a
Cloudy model of log $\xi = 1.45 \pm 0.05$ erg cm s$^{-1}$, log $N_H = 22.9 \pm
0.4$ cm$^{-2}$ and log v$_{turb} = 2.25 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ for the emitting
gas; this is the first time the X-ray NLR gas in this source has been modelled
so comprehensively. This allows us to estimate the distance from the central
source to the illuminated face of the emitting clouds as $13.9 \pm 0.6$ pc,
consistent with previous work.

\cite{DK}, where we studied the linear growth of minimizers in a Bernoulli type
free boundary problem at the non-flat points and the related regularity of free
boundary. There, we also defined the functional
$$\phi_p(r,u,x_0)=\frac1{r^4}\int_{B_r(x_0)}\frac{|\nabla
u^+(x)|^p}{|x-x_0|^{N-2}}dx\int_{B_r(x_0)}\frac{|\nabla
u^-(x)|^p}{|x-x_0|^{N-2}}dx$$ where $x_0$ is a free boundary point, i.e.
$x_0\in\partial\{u>0\}$ and $u$ is a minimizer of the functional
$$J(u):=\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^p +\lambda_+^p\,\chi_{\{u>0\}}
+\lambda_-^p\,\chi_{\{u\le 0\}}, $$ for some bounded smooth domain
$\Omega\subset {\mathbb R}^N$ and positive constants $\lambda_\pm$ with
$\Lambda:=\lambda_+^p-\lambda^p_->0$.
  Here we show the discrete monotonicity of $\phi_p(r,u,x_0)$ in two spatial
dimensions at non-flat points, when $p$ is sufficiently close to 2, and then
establish the linear growth. A new feature of our approach is the anisotropic
scaling argument discussed in Section 4.

investigated through the magnetization and electric polarization measurements
in pulsed high magnetic fields. If the magnetic field is applied normal to the
spin chiral c-axis, a plateau and a jump in magnetization are observed. Between
the plateau and the jump in magnetization, a small but significant electric
polarization of about 0.25 {\mu}C/m$^2$ along the a-axis is observed with the
field applied almost perpendicular to the ac-plane. In addition, the
paramagnetoelectric effect expected from the point group symmetry is confirmed.
The emergence of the electric polarization is explained by the cooperation of
the local electric polarization on the chiral solitonic spin arrangement and
the paramagnetoelectric effect. Hence, we interpret this novel multiferroic
phase in CsCuCl$_3$ as a polar solitonic phase.

this question using the nonstandard system from [9]. This system validates
so-called non-standard uniform boundedness principles which are central to
Kohlenbach's approach to proof mining ([14]). In particular, we show that from
classical and ineffective existence proofs (not involving Nonstandard Analysis

provides information on the electrical polarization and structural changes of

  Moreover, we show that for every left-invariant Riemannian distance $d$ on

multiple contiguous basic channels in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). A
WLAN operating under DCB can enjoy a larger bandwidth, when available, and
therefore achieve a higher throughput. However, the use of larger bandwidths
also increases the contention with adjacent WLANs, which can result in longer
delays in accessing the channel and consequently, a lower throughput. In this
paper, a scenario consisting of multiple WLANs using DCB and operating within
carrier-sensing range of one another is considered. An analytical framework for
evaluating the performance of such networks is presented. The analysis is
carried out using a Markov chain model that characterizes the interactions
between adjacent WLANs with overlapping channels. An algorithm is proposed for
systematically constructing the Markov chain corresponding to any given
scenario. The analytical model is then used to highlight and explain the key
properties that differentiate DCB networks of WLANs from those operating on a
single shared channel. Furthermore, the analysis is applied to networks of IEEE
802.11ac WLANs operating under DCB--which do not fully comply with some of the
simplifying assumptions in our analysis--to show that the analytical model can
give accurate results in more realistic scenarios.

Also, bad cavities are feasible for fast quantum operations and reading out

auxiliary qubits and measurements. Moreover, the schematic setups for these
gates are simple, especially that for our Toffoli gate as only a quarter wave
packet is used to interact the photon with each of the atoms every time. These
atom-cavity systems can be used as the quantum nodes in long-distance quantum

incompatible with the behavior of the specific volume, evaporation heat, and

Nuclear Norm Minimization (NNM) and Weighted NNM (WNNM). The problems related
to NNM, or WNNM, can be solved iteratively by applying a closed-form proximal
operator, called Singular Value Thresholding (SVT), or Weighted SVT, but they
suffer from high computational cost of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) at
each iteration. We propose a fast and accurate approximation method for SVT,
that we call fast randomized SVT (FRSVT), with which we avoid direct
computation of SVD. The key idea is to extract an approximate basis for the
range of the matrix from its compressed matrix. Given the basis, we compute
partial singular values of the original matrix from the small factored matrix.
In addition, by developping a range propagation method, our method further
speeds up the extraction of approximate basis at each iteration. Our
theoretical analysis shows the relationship between the approximation bound of
SVD and its effect to NNM via SVT. Along with the analysis, our empirical
results quantitatively and qualitatively show that our approximation rarely
harms the convergence of the host algorithms. We assess the efficiency and
accuracy of the proposed method on various computer vision problems, e.g.,
subspace clustering, weather artifact removal, and simultaneous multi-image
alignment and rectification.

to determine the invisible particle mass simultaneously with the parent

in the Lamb shift, which has been parametrized in terms of a proton charge
radius differing by seven standard deviations from the CODATA value. We show
how this anomaly may be explained, within about a factor of three, in the
framework of an effective Yukawian gravitational potential related to charged
weak interactions, without additional free parameters with respect to the ones
of the standard model. The residual discrepancy from the experimental result in
this model should be attributable to the approximations introduced in the
calculation, the uncertainty in the exact value of the Fermi scale relevant to
the model and the lack of detailed knowledge on the gravitational radius of the
proton. The latter cannot be inferred with electromagnetic probes due to the
unknown gluonic contribution to the proton mass distribution. In this context,
we argue that muonic hydrogen acts like a microscopic gravimeter suitable for
testing a possible scenario for the reciprocal morphing between macroscopic
gravitation and weak interactions, with the latter seen as the quantum,
microscopic counterpart of the former.

  We compare an alternating least squares fit (ALS) to an overrelaxation scheme

  Both approaches aim at finding a tensor $A$ that fulfils the first order
optimality conditions by a nonlinear Gauss-Seidel type solver that consists of
an alternating fit cycling through the directions $\mu=1,\ldots,d$.
  The least squares fit is of complexity ${\cal O}(r^4d\#P)$ per step, whereas
each step of ADF is in ${\cal O}(r^2d\#P)$, albeit with a slightly higher

and uses a graph-based approach to connect those detections across time, based
on their position and appearance estimates. In contrast to most earlier works
in the field, our framework has been designed to exploit the appearance
features, even when they are only sporadically available, or affected by a
non-stationary noise, along the sequence of detections. This is done by
implementing an iterative hypothesis testing strategy to progressively
aggregate the detections into short trajectories, named tracklets.
Specifically, each iteration considers a node, named key-node, and investigates
how to link this key-node with other nodes in its neighborhood, under the
assumption that the target appearance is defined by the key-node appearance
estimate. This is done through shortest path computation in a temporal
neighborhood of the key-node. The approach is conservative in that it only
aggregates the shortest paths that are sufficiently better compared to
alternative paths. It is also multi-scale in that the size of the investigated
neighborhood is increased proportionally to the number of detections already
aggregated into the key-node. The multi-scale nature of the process and the
progressive relaxation of its conservativeness makes it both computationally
efficient and effective.
  Experimental validations are performed extensively on a toy example, a 15
minutes long multi-view basketball dataset, and other monocular pedestrian
datasets.

transitions of many-body systems by means of local time correlations and
Leggett-Garg inequalities. This procedure allows to experimentally determine
the quantum critical points not only of finite-order transitions but also those
of infinite order, as the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition that is not always
easy to detect with current methods. By means of simple analytical arguments
for a general spin-$1 / 2$ Hamiltonian, and matrix product simulations of
one-dimensional $X X Z$ and anisotropic $X Y$ models, we argue that
finite-order quantum phase transitions can be determined by singularities of
the time correlations or their derivatives at criticality. The same features
are exhibited by corresponding Leggett-Garg functions, which noticeably
indicate violation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities for early times and all the
Hamiltonian parameters considered. In addition, we find that the infinite-order
transition of the $X X Z$ model at the isotropic point can be revealed by the
maximal violation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities. We thus show that quantum
phase transitions can be identified by purely local measurements, and that
many-body systems constitute important candidates to observe experimentally the
violation of Leggett-Garg inequalities.

supergiant counterpart to RX~J004722.4-252051, a ULX in NGC 253. We measure
radial velocities of the object and its approximate spectral type by
cross-correlating our spectra with those of known red supergiants. Our
VLT/X-shooter spectrum is best matched by that of early M-type supergiants,
confirming the red supergiant nature of the candidate counterpart. The radial
velocity of the spectrum, taken on 2014, August 23, is $417 \pm 4$ km/s. This
is consistent with the radial velocity measured in our spectrum taken with
Magellan/MMIRS on 2013, June 28, of $410 \pm 70$ km/s, although the large error
on the latter implies that a radial velocity shift expected for a black hole of
tens of $M_\odot$ can easily be hidden. Using nebular emission lines we find
that the radial velocity due to the rotation of NGC 253 is 351 $\pm$ 4 km/s at
the position of the ULX. Thus the radial velocity of the counterpart confirms
that the source is located in NGC 253, but also shows an offset with respect to
the local bulk motion of the galaxy of 66 $\pm$ 6 km/s. We argue that the most
likely origin for this displacement lies either in a SN kick, requiring a
system containing a $\gtrsim 50$ $M_\odot$ black hole, and/or in orbital radial
velocity variations in the ULX binary system, requiring a $\gtrsim 100$
$M_\odot$ black hole. We therefore conclude that RX~J004722.4-252051 is a
strong candidate for a ULX containing a massive stellar black hole.

Telescope Legacy Survey programme. Data from the l=30 degree survey region,
which contains the massive star-forming regions W43 and G29.96, are analysed
after approximately 40% of the observations had been completed. The
pixel-to-pixel noise is found to be 19 mJy/beam, after a smooth over the beam
area, and the projected equivalent noise levels in the final survey are
expected to be around 10 mJy/beam. An initial extraction of compact sources was
performed using the FellWalker method resulting in the detection of 1029
sources above a 5-{\sigma} surface-brightness threshold. The completeness
limits in these data are estimated to be around 0.2 Jy/beam (peak flux density)
and 0.8 Jy (integrated flux density) and are therefore probably already
dominated by source confusion in this relatively crowded section of the survey.
The flux densities of extracted compact sources are consistent with those of
matching detections in the shallower ATLASGAL survey. We analyse the virial and
evolutionary state of the detected clumps in the W43 star-forming complex and
find that they appear younger than the Galactic-plane average.

the galaxy at 182 Mpc). We detect a new outburst of the source in a Chandra

factor $> 60$. New HST/WFC3 observations obtained in 2014 show that the optical
counterpart is still visible at $g' = 27.1 \pm 0.1$, $1 \pm 0.1$ magnitude
fainter than in the discovery HST/ACS observation from 2003. This optical
variability strongly suggests that the optical and X-ray source are related.
Furthermore, these properties strongly favour an HLX nature of the source over
the alternative scenarios. We therefore conclude that CXO J122518.6+144545 is
most likely an outbursting HLX. It is only the second such object to be

present evidence showing that the brightest near infrared and mid infrared
source in the central region, already known as radio source TH7 and so far
considered just a stellar supercluster, in fact, presents various symptoms of a
genuine galactic nucleus. Therefore, it should be considered a valid nucleus
candidate. It is the most massive compact infrared object in the central
region, located at 2.0"" of the symmetry center of the galactic bar. Moreover,
our data indicate that this object is surrounded by a large circumnuclear
stellar disk and it is also located at the rotation center of the large
molecular gas disk of NGC 253. Furthermore, a kinematic residual appears in the
H2 rotation curve with a sinusoidal shape consistent with an outflow centered
in the candidate nucleus position. The maximum outflow velocity is located
about 14 pc from TH7, which is consistent with the radius of a shell detected
around the nucleus candidate observed at 18.3 {\mu}m (Qa) and 12.8 {\mu}m

In
our repeated game there are $n$ bidders and $m$ mechanisms, and in each round
each mechanism is available for each bidder only with a certain probability.
Our scenario is an elementary case of simple mechanism design with incomplete
information, where availabilities are bidder types. It captures natural
applications in online markets with limited supply and can be used to model
access of unreliable channels in wireless networks.
  If mechanisms satisfy a smoothness guarantee, existing results show that
learning outcomes recover a significant fraction of the optimal social welfare.
These approaches, however, have serious drawbacks in terms of plausibility and
computational complexity. Also, the guarantees apply only when availabilities
are stochastically independent among bidders.
  In contrast, we propose an alternative approach where each bidder uses a
single no-regret learning algorithm and applies it in all rounds. This results
in what we call availability-oblivious coarse correlated equilibria. It
exponentially decreases the learning burden, simplifies implementation (e.g.,
as a method for channel access in wireless devices), and thereby addresses some
of the concerns about Bayes-Nash equilibria and learning outcomes in Bayesian
settings. Our main results are general composition theorems for smooth
mechanisms when valuation functions of bidders are lattice-submodular. They
rely on an interesting connection to the notion of correlation gap of
submodular functions over product lattices.

we show that within our model the Green-Wald framework uniquely determines
backreaction for finite size inhomogeneities on a predefined background. The
results agree with those calculated in the Charach-Malin approach. In the
vacuum limit, the Green-Wald, the Charach-Malin and the Isaacson method imply
identical backreaction as expected.

very similar terms: Leggett-Garg inequalities follow Bell inequalities as
necessary conditions for classical behavior. Here, we compare the probability
polytopes spanned by all measurable probability distributions for both
scenarios and show that their structure differs strongly between spatially and
temporally separated measurements. We arrive at the conclusion that, in
contrast to tests of local realism where Bell inequalities form a necessary and
sufficient set of conditions, no set of inequalities can ever be necessary and
sufficient for a macrorealistic description. Fine's famous proof that Bell
inequalities are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a local
realistic model, therefore cannot be transferred to macrorealism. A recently
proposed condition, no-signaling in time, fulfills this criterion, and we show
why it is better suited for future experimental tests and theoretical studies
of macrorealism. Our work thereby identifies a major difference between the
mathematical structures of local realism and macrorealism.

previously observed and is morphologically and kinematically lopsided on all
scales with evidence for strong non-circular motions in the central regions.
Our data reveal prominent gas streams encircling the entire galaxy suggesting
strong interaction with its neighbours. A 33-kpc long HI bridge is detected
between NGC 3079 and MCG 9-17-9, likely caused by ram-pressure stripping of MGC
9-17-9 by the halo of hot gas of NGC 3079. The cometary HI tail of the
companion NGC 3073, earlier discovered by Irwin et al., extends about twice as
long in our data, while a shorter, second tail is also found. This tail is
likely caused by ram-pressure stripping by the strong, starburst driven wind
coming from NGC 3079. We also detect, in absorption, a nuclear HI outflow
extending to velocities well outside what expected for gravitational motion.
This is likely an atomic counterpart of the well-studied outflow of ionised gas
present in this galaxy. This may indicate that also large amounts of cold gas
are blown out of NGC 3079 by the starburst/AGN. Our estimates of the jet energy

powerful enough to drive the atomic outflow.

large infrared luminosities. In complex systems in particular, where intense
star formation (SF) coexists with an active galactic nucleus (AGN), it is not
clear yet from observations whether the SF, the AGN, or both are driving these
outflows. Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are expected to influence
their host galaxies through kinetic and radiative feedback processes, but in a
Seyfert galaxy where the energy emitted in the nuclear region is comparable to
that of the body of the galaxy, it is possible that stellar activity is also
playing a key role in these processes. In order to achieve a better
understanding of the mechanisms driving the gas evolution specially at the
nuclear regions of these galaxies, we have performed high-resolution
three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooling considering
the feedback from both star formation regions including supernova (type I and
II) explosions and an AGN jet emerging from the central region of the active
spiral galaxy. We computed the gas mass lost by the system, separating the role
of each of these injection energy sources on the galaxy evolution and found
that at scales within one kiloparsec an outflow can be generally established
considering intense nuclear star formation only. The jet alone is unable to
drive a massive gas outflow, although it can sporadically drag and accelerate
clumps of the underlying outflow to very high velocities.

Ludwig Boltzmann's audacious effort to explain the macroscopic world of human
experience in terms of the workings of an unseen microscopic world met with
vigorous opposition. A contentious point was the problem of irreversibility:
the microscopic equations of motion are reversible, yet friction and viscosity
cause things always to slow down and warm up, never to speed up and cool down.
What was worse, Boltzmann himself discovered that his transport equation
predicts special cases in which gases never come to thermal equilibrium, a
particular example being that the monopole ""breathe"" mode of gas will never
damp if it is confined in 3D to a perfectly isotropic harmonic potential. Such
absences of damping were not observed in nature. Nondamping of a monopole mode
in lower dimensional systems has only very recently been observed, using cold
atoms. Kinoshita et al. and Chevy et al. have experimentally observed
suppressed relaxation in highly elongated geometries. The difficulty in
generating sufficiently spherical harmonic confinement for ultracold atoms,
however, has meant that Boltzmann's fully 3D, isotropic case has never been
observed. With the development of a new magnetic trap capable of producing
near-spherical harmonic confinement for ultracold atoms, we have been able to
make the first observation of this historically significant oddity. We observe
a monopole mode for which the collisional contribution to damping vanishes, a
long-delayed vindication for Boltzmann's microscopic theory.

how to relax the breakpointError to obtain an annotation error function which
can be used more readily in practice on real data. A fast C implementation of
an algorithm that computes the breakpointError is available in an R package on

found on the basis of the simplest MIT bag model equation of state (EOS) in the
form $p=\frac{1}{3}(\rho-4B)$ where $B$ is the bag constant. The proposed
interior metric for the stellar system is consistent with the exterior
Schwarzschild spacetime on the boundary. In addition, we also conduct a
detailed study on different tests, viz. the energy conditions, TOV equation,
adiabatic index, Buchdahl limit, etc., to verify the physical validity of the
proposed model. The numerical value of the used parameters is predicted for
different strange star candidates, for different chosen values of the bag

a singularity-free and stable stellar model which is suitable to describe

and shown to encode the simplicial geometries in 4-dimensions. The gauge
theories are defined by applying the Dimofte-Gaiotto-Gukov construction in
3d/3d correspondence to certain graph complement 3-manifolds. Given a gauge
theory in this class, the massive supersymmetric vacua of the theory contain
the classical geometries on a 4d simplicial complex. The corresponding 4d
simplicial geometries are locally constant curvature (either dS or AdS), in the

curvature. When the simplicial complex is sufficiently refined, the simplicial
geometries can approximate all possible smooth geometries on 4-manifold. At the
quantum level, we propose that a class of holomorphic blocks defined in
arXiv:1211.1986 from the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories are wave functions
of quantum 4d simplicial geometries. In the semiclassical limit, the asymptotic
behavior of holomorphic block reproduces the classical action of 4d

incomplete. To provide an alternative approach, we argue that the Schroedinger
equation is a consequence of three partial differential equations governing the
time evolution of a given probability density. These equations, discovered by
E. Madelung, naturally ground the Schroedinger theory in Newtonian mechanics
and Kolmogorovian probability theory. A variety of far-reaching consequences
for the projection postulate, the correspondence principle, the measurement

web log data is transformed into a set of user profiles. Each user profile
captures a set of URLs representing a user session. Clustering can be applied
to this sessionized data in order to capture similar interests and trends among
users navigational patterns. Since the sessionized data may contain thousands
of user sessions and each user session may consist of hundreds of URL accesses,
dimensionality reduction is achieved by eliminating the low support URLs. Very
small sessions are also removed in order to filter out the noise from the data.
But direct elimination of low support URLs and small sized sessions may results
in loss of a significant amount of information especially when the count of low
support URLs and small sessions is large. We propose a fuzzy solution to deal
with this problem by assigning weights to URLs and user sessions based on a
fuzzy membership function. After assigning the weights we apply a Fuzzy c-Mean
Clustering algorithm to discover the clusters of user profiles. In this paper,
we describe our fuzzy set theoretic approach to perform feature selection (or
dimensionality reduction) and session weight assignment. Finally we compare our
soft computing based approach of dimensionality reduction with the traditional
approach of direct elimination of small sessions and low support count URLs.
Our results show that fuzzy feature evaluation and dimensionality reduction
results in better performance and validity indices for the discovered clusters.

surface, which is the kind of data typically provided by medical imaging for
thin volumes. The bidomain equations are considered in their usual formulation
in the ventricles, and in a surface formulation on the atria. Two ionic models
are used: the Courtemanche-Ramirez-Nattel model on the atria, and the ""Minimal
model for human Ventricular action potentials"" (MV) by Bueno-Orovio, Cherry and
Fenton in the ventricles. The heart is weakly coupled to the torso by a Robin
boundary condition based on a resistor- capacitor transmission condition.
Various ECGs are simulated in healthy and pathological conditions (left and
right bundle branch blocks, Bachmann's bundle block, Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome). To assess the numerical ECGs, we use several qualitative and
quantitative criteria found in the medical literature. Our simulator can also
be used to generate the signals measured by a vest of electrodes. This
capability is illustrated at the end of the article.
