components of the Riemann surface. In Poincar\'e uniformization, these bordered
cusps correspond to ideal triangles in the fundamental domain. We introduce the
notion of bordered cusped Teichm\""uller space and endow it with a Poisson
structure, quantization of which is achieved with a canonical quantum ordering.
We give a complete combinatorial description of the bordered cusped
Teichm\""uller space by introducing the notion of maximal cusped lamination, a
lamination consisting of geodesics arcs between bordered cusps and closed
geodesics homotopic to the boundaries such that it triangulates the Riemann
surface. We show that each bordered cusp carries a natural decoration, i.e. a
choice of a horocycle, so that the lengths of the arcs in the maximal cusped
lamination are defined as $\lambda$-lengths in Thurston--Penner terminology. We
compute the Goldman bracket explicitly in terms of these $\lambda$-lengths and
show that the Mapping Class Group acts as a generalized cluster algebra
mutation. From the physical point of view, our construction provides an
explicit coordinatization of moduli spaces of open/closed string worldsheets

lowering the temperature, one can change the band ordering from trivial to
nontrivial one in which the topological crystalline insulator states appear at

the supra-contact tensor as a function of the ratio of two spreading rates: if
the rate at which the disease spreads within a layer is comparable to the
spreading rate across layers, the individual spectra of each layer merge with
the coupling between layers. Finally, we verified the barrier effect, i.e., for
three-layer configuration, when the layer with the largest eigenvalue is
located at the center of the line, it can effectively act as a barrier to the

distribution transformer aging, the distribution energy losses, and a component
inherent to the EV itself (e.g., the battery charging monetary cost). Charging
start times are determined by the proposed distributed algorithm, whose
analysis is conducted by using game-theoretic tools such as ordinal potential
games. Convergence of the proposed algorithm is shown to be guaranteed for some
important special cases. Remarkably, the performance loss w.r.t. the
centralized solution is shown to be small. Simulations, based on realistic

and optimality loss and provide clear messages about the tradeoff associated
with the presence of the three components in the considered cost function.
While simulations show that the proposed charging policy performs quite
similarly to existing (continuous) charging policies such as
valley-filling-type solutions when the non-EV demand forecast is perfect, they
reveal an additional asset of rectangular profiles in presence of forecasting

redshifts and greater than $-1$ at high redshifts are more favored. In this
paper, It is shown that how such a pattern of an evolving dark energy EOS can
be just biases arising from the statistical method widely adopted in data
analyses together with the dependence of the cosmic expansion on the dark
energy EOS. The issue is actually not limited to dark energy or cosmology. It
represents a class of mathematical problems of Bayesian analysis. It should be

of sand fraction from multiple seismic attributes such as seismic impedance,
amplitude and frequency using machine learning and information filtering. The
available well logs along with the 3-D seismic data have been used to benchmark
the proposed pre-processing stage using a methodology which primarily consists
of three steps: pre-processing, training and post-processing. An Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) with conjugate-gradient learning algorithm has been used
to model the sand fraction. The available sand fraction data from the high
resolution well logs has far more information content than the low resolution
seismic attributes. Therefore, regularization schemes based on Fourier
Transform (FT), Wavelet Decomposition (WD) and Empirical Mode Decomposition
(EMD) have been proposed to shape the high resolution sand fraction data for
effective machine learning. The input data sets have been segregated into
training, testing and validation sets. The test results are primarily used to
check different network structures and activation function performances. Once
the network passes the testing phase with an acceptable performance in terms of
the selected evaluators, the validation phase follows. In the validation stage,
the prediction model is tested against unseen data. The network yielding
satisfactory performance in the validation stage is used to predict
lithological properties from seismic attributes throughout a given volume.
Finally, a post-processing scheme using 3-D spatial filtering is implemented
for smoothing the sand fraction in the volume. Prediction of lithological
properties using this framework is helpful for Reservoir Characterization.

networks involved in metabolism and regulation. The main feature of our
approach is to constrain in the Plefka expansion not just first moments akin to
magnetizations, but also second moments, specifically two-time correlations and
responses for each degree of freedom. The end result is an effective equation
of motion for each single degree of freedom, where couplings to other variables
appear as a self-coupling to the past (i.e. memory term) and a coloured noise.
This constitutes a new mean field approximation that should become exact in the
thermodynamic limit of a large network, for suitably long-ranged couplings. For
the analytically tractable case of linear dynamics we establish this exactness
explicitly by appeal to spectral methods of Random Matrix Theory, for Gaussian
couplings with arbitrary degree of symmetry.

and shale layers in the basin area makes the modeling of reservoir
characteristic a challenging task. Though seismic data is helpful in
extrapolation of reservoir properties away from boreholes; yet, it could be
challenging to delineate thin sand and shale reservoirs using seismic data due
to its limited resolvability. Therefore, it is important to develop
state-of-art intelligent methods for calibrating a nonlinear mapping between

hybrid variants of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and fuzzy logic, i.e., NF
methods, are capable for the modeling reservoir characteristics by integrating
the explicit knowledge representation power of FL with the learning ability of

in the curvelet domain to take advantage of the directional selectivity of the

is used to calculate the feature correspondences. Correspondence rejection
using Random Sample Consensus identifies inliers, and a locally optimal

compared with ASD.Two conditions of moving the probe with constant force (CF)

probability distribution of colloidal particles around the probe, g(r), which
is computed as a solution to the pair Smoluchowski equation (SE) for
0.2<\phi<0.50, and a range of Peclet numbers (Pe), describing the ratio of
external force on the probe to thermal forces.Results of ASD and theory
demonstrate that a wake zone depleted of bath particles behind the moving probe
forms at large Pe, while a boundary-layer accumulation develops upstream.The
wake length saturates at Pe>>1 for CF while it continuously grows in CV.This
contrast in behavior is related to the dispersion in the motion of the probe
under CF conditions, while CV motion has no dispersion.This effect is
incorporated in the theory as a force-induced hydrodynamic diffusion flux in
the pair SE. We also demonstrate that, despite this difference of structure in
CF and CV, g(r) near the probe is set by Pe, for both CF and CV resulting in
similar values for their viscosity.Using the theory, the structural anisotropy
and Brownian viscosity near equilibrium are shown to be quantitatively similar
in both CF and CV motions, which is in contrast with the dilute theory which
predict distortions and Brownian viscosities twice as large in CV, relative to
CF.This difference arises due to the many-body interactions associated with the
equilibrium structure in the moderate to dense regime.

initially unknown Hamiltonian arises from transporting an ion through a static,
near-resonant laser beam. Hamiltonian estimation allows us to estimate the
spatial dependence of the laser beam intensity and the ion's velocity as a
function of time. This work is of direct value in optimizing transport
operations and transport-based gates in scalable trapped ion quantum
information processing, while the estimation technique is general enough that
it can be applied to other quantum systems, aiding the pursuit of high
operational fidelities in quantum control.

compounds reveal an enhancement of superconductivity and a rapid crossover
between two different conducting phases above the superconducting dome. One of
these phases is a Fermi liquid, the other not. Using plaquette cellular
dynamical mean field theory with state of the art continuous-time quantum Monte
Carlo calculations, we study this problem with the two-dimensional Hubbard
model on the anisotropic triangular lattice. Phase diagrams as a function of
temperature $T$ and interaction strength $U/t$ are obtained for anisotropy
parameters $t'=0.4t$, $t'=0.8t$ and various fillings. As for cuprates, we find,
at finite doping, a first-order transition between two normal-state phases. For
$T$ above the critical point of the first-order transition, there is a Widom
line where crossovers occur. The results are in broad agreement with
experiment. This suggests that for compounds with intermediate to high
frustration, very light-doping should reveal the first-order transition and
associated crossovers. These crossovers could leave traces in the
superconducting phase. We also predict that destroying the superconducting
phase by a magnetic field should reveal the first-order transition. Finally, we
predict that electron-doping should also lead to an increased range of $U/t$
for superconductivity but with a reduced maximum $T_c$. This work also clearly
shows that the superconducting dome here is tied to the Mott transition and its
continuation as a transition separating pseudogap phase from correlated metal
in doped compounds, as in the cuprates. Contrary to heavy fermions for example,
the maximum $T_c$ is definitely not attached to an antiferromagnetic quantum

The specific flavor structure of the model, guided by the $A_4 \times Z_4

yields the conventional seesaw contribution to produce the tribimaximal lepton
mixing which is further corrected by the presence of the $SU(2)_L$ triplet
contribution to accommodate $\theta_{13}$. We consider the CP symmetry to be
spontaneously broken by the complex vacuum expectation value (vev) of a singlet
field $S$. While the magnitude of its complex vev is responsible for generating
$\theta_{13}$, its phase part induces the low energy CP violating phase
($\delta$) and the CP violation required for leptogenesis. Hence the triplet
contribution, although sub-dominant, plays crucial role in providing a common
source for non-zero $\theta_{13}$, $\delta$ and CP-violation required for

with a high degree of optical linear polarization. To understand the optical
properties we have performed atomistic tight-binding calculations, and based on
our initial atom probe tomography data, the model includes the effects of
strain and built-in field variations arising from random alloy fluctuations.
Furthermore, we included Coulomb effects in the calculations. Our microscopic
theoretical description reveals strong hole wave function localization effects
due to random alloy fluctuations, resulting in strong variations in ground
state energies and consequently the corresponding transition energies. This is
consistent with the experimentally observed broad PL peak. Furthermore, when
including Coulomb contributions in the calculations we find strong exciton
localization effects which explain the form of the PL decay transients.

the response of fully supported and suspended samples using different laser

Jacobi fields, a notion recently proved to be generic by B. White) the same
conclusion holds true for any closed 3-manifold.

Sansom, Robin Williams","Parameter uncertainty in forecast recalibration","22 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1002/qj.2716",,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ensemble forecasts of weather and climate are subject to systematic biases in
the ensemble mean and variance, leading to inaccurate estimates of the forecast
mean and variance. To address these biases, ensemble forecasts are
post-processed using statistical recalibration frameworks. These frameworks
often specify parametric probability distributions for the verifying
observations. A common choice is the Normal distribution with mean and variance
specified by linear functions of the ensemble mean and variance. The parameters
of the recalibration framework are estimated from historical archives of
forecasts and verifying observations. Often there are relatively few forecasts
and observations available for parameter estimation, and so the fitted
parameters are also subject to uncertainty. This artefact is usually ignored.
This study reviews analytic results that account for parameter uncertainty in
the widely used Model Output Statistics recalibration framework. The predictive
bootstrap is used to approximate the parameter uncertainty by resampling in
more general frameworks such as Non-homogeneous Gaussian Regression. Forecasts
on daily, seasonal and annual time scales are used to demonstrate that
accounting for parameter uncertainty in the recalibrated predictive
distributions leads to probability forecasts that are more skilful and reliable
than those in which parameter uncertainty is ignored. The improvements are
attributed to more reliable tail probabilities of the recalibrated forecast
distributions.

  Applications",,,"10.1016/j.csi.2016.10.015",,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Runtime reconfiguration is a fundamental requirement of many
telecommunication applications which also has been addressed by management
standards like CMIP, 3GPP TS 32.602, and NETCONF. Two basic commands considered
by these standards are CREATE and DELETE which operate on managed objects
inside an application. The available configuration management technologies,
like JMX, OSGi, and Fractal, do not support the CREATE and DELETE
reconfiguration commands of the telecommunication standards. In this paper, we
introduce a novel technology, called RSCM, for development of runtime
reconfigurable applications complying with the telecommunication standards. The
RSCM subagent takes the responsibility of loading the application from the
configuration file, executing the runtime reconfiguration commands (including
CREATE and DELETE), enforcing validity of the configuration state, and updating
the configuration file according to the latest reconfiguration commands. We
exploit the modular and object oriented features of the XML technology for
storing the configuration state of a program in a configuration file. The
software development process is tailored such that the design of XML schemas of
managed classes is performed parallel to the design of software classes. In
addition, a novel programming approach based on indirect referencing is
proposed which allows safe and almost immediate deletion of managed objects at
runtime. This indirect referencing mechanism affects the implementation of
associations in class diagrams and prevents methods of a class to use the this
pointer freely. The RSCM technology has been successfully used in several
commercial telecommunication applications; including an SMS service center, an
SMS gateway, and an SMS hub.

explained, because the chiral T and mu are calculated using different order

of residual gas expulsion from the gas-embedded progenitors of present-day
globular clusters (GCs) on the stellar mass function (MF). Our models start
either tidally filling or underfilling, and either with or without primordial
mass segregation. We cover 100 Myr of the evolution of modeled clusters and
show that the expulsion of residual gas from initially mass-segregated clusters
leads to a significantly shallower slope of the stellar MF in the low- ($m\leq
0.50 M_\odot$) and intermediate-mass ($\simeq 0.50-0.85 M_\odot$) regime.
Therefore, the imprint of residual gas expulsion and primordial mass
segregation might be visible in the present-day MF. We find that the strength
of the external tidal field, as an essential parameter, influences the degree
of flattening, such that a primordially mass-segregated tidally-filling cluster
with $r_h/r_t\geq 0.1$ shows a strongly depleted MF in the intermediate stellar
mass range. Therefore, the shape of the present-day stellar MF in this mass
range probes the birth place of clusters in the Galactic environment. We
furthermore find that this flattening agrees with the observed correlation
between the concentration of a cluster and its MF slope, as found by de Marchi
et al.. We show that if the expansion through the residual gas expulsion in
primordial mass segregated clusters is the reason for this correlation then GCs
most probably formed in strongly fluctuating local tidal fields in the early
proto-Milky Way potential, supporting the recent conclusion by Marks \& Kroupa.

Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. This paper focuses on the emission line
galaxies (ELG) population targetted from the Dark Energy Survey (DES)
photometry. We analyse the success rate, efficiency, redshift distribution, and
clustering properties of the targets. From the 9000 spectroscopic redshifts
targetted, 4600 have been selected from the DES photometry. The total success
rate for redshifts between 0.6 and 1.2 is 71\% and 68\% respectively for a
bright and faint, on average more distant, samples including redshifts measured
from a single strong emission line. We find a mean redshift of 0.8 and 0.87,
with 15 and 13\% of unknown redshifts respectively for the bright and faint
samples. In the redshift range 0.6<z<1.2, for the most secure spectroscopic
redshifts, the mean redshift for the bright and faint sample is 0.85 and 0.9
respectively. Star contamination is lower than 2\%. We measure a galaxy bias
averaged on scales of 1 and 10~Mpc/h of 1.72 \pm 0.1 for the bright sample and
of 1.78 \pm 0.12 for the faint sample. The error on the galaxy bias have been
obtained propagating the errors in the correlation function to the fitted
parameters. This redshift evolution for the galaxy bias is in agreement with
theoretical expectations for a galaxy population with MB-5\log h < -21.0. We
note that biasing is derived from the galaxy clustering relative to a model for
the mass fluctuations. We investigate the quality of the DES photometric
redshifts and find that the outlier fraction can be reduced using a comparison
between template fitting and neural network, or using a random forest
algorithm.

important for impact hazard assessment and evaluating mitigation options. Close
flybys of PHAs provide an opportunity to study their surface photometric and
spectral properties that enable identification of their source regions in the
main asteroid belt. We observed PHA (357439) 2004 BL86 during a close flyby of
the Earth at a distance of 1.2 million km (0.0080 AU) on January 26, 2015, with
an array of ground-based telescopes to constrain its photometric and spectral
properties. Lightcurve observations showed that the asteroid was a binary and
subsequent radar observations confirmed the binary nature and gave a primary
diameter of 300 meters and a secondary diameter of 50-100 meters. Our
photometric observations were used to derive the phase curve of 2004 BL86 in
the V-band. Two different photometric functions were fitted to this phase
curve, the IAU H-G model (Bowell et al. 1989) and the Shevchenko model
(Shevchenko 1996). From the fit of the H-G function we obtained an absolute
magnitude H=19.51+/-0.02 and a slope parameter G=0.34+/-0.02. The Shevchenko
function yielded an absolute magnitude of H=19.03+/-0.07 and a phase
coefficient b=0.0225+/-0.0006. The phase coefficient was used to calculate the
geometric albedo (Ag) using the relationship found by Belskaya and Schevchenko
(2000), obtaining a value of Ag=40+/-8% in the V-band. With the geometric
albedo and the absolute magnitudes derived from the H-G and the Shevchenko
functions we calculated the diameter (D) of 2004 BL86, obtaining D=263+/-26,
and D=328+/-35 meters, respectively. 2004 BL86 spectral band parameters and
pyroxene chemistry are consistent with non-cumulate eucrite meteorites.

non-uniform mass and energy source distributions, a gravitational potential
from an extended mass source, and radiative losses. The model easily produces
steady-state wind solutions for a range of mass-loading factors, energy-loading
factors, galaxy mass and galaxy radius. We find that, with radiative losses
included, highly mass-loaded winds must be driven at high central temperatures,
whereas low mass-loaded winds can be driven at low temperatures just above the
peak of the cooling curve, meaning radiative losses can drastically affect the
wind solution even for low mass-loading factors. By including radiative losses,
we are able to show that subsonic flows can be ignored as a possible mechanism
for expelling mass and energy from a galaxy compared to the more efficient
transonic solutions. Specifically, the transonic solutions with low
mass-loading and high energy-loading are the most efficient. Our model also
produces low-temperature, high-velocity winds that could explain the prevalence
of low-temperature material in observed outflows. Finally, we show that our
model, unlike the well-known Chevalier & Clegg (1985) model, can reproduce the
observed linear relationship between wind X-ray luminosity and star formation
rate (SFR) over a large range of SFR from $1-1000$ M$_{\odot}$/yr assuming the
wind mass-loading factor is higher for low-mass, and hence, low-SFR galaxies.
We also constrain the allowed mass-loading factors that can fit the observed
X-ray luminosity vs. SFR trend, further suggesting an inverse relationship
between mass-loading and SFR as explored in advanced numerical simulations.

We build a self-consistent model of the ionizing background that includes
fluctuations in the mean free path due to the varying strength of the ionizing

suppression of the ionizing background in large-scale voids due to
""self-shielding"" by an enhanced number of optically thick absorbers. Our model
results in a distribution of 50 Mpc/h Lyman-alpha forest effective optical
depths that significantly improves agreement with the observations at z~5.6.
Extrapolation to z~5.4 and z~5.8 appears promising, but matching the mean

The only way to avoid this is to have detection efficiencies that are above a

detection efficiency, that is, in each run of the experiment, the overall
detection efficiency is lower bounded by $\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, in an

some linear Bell-like inequalities. We prove that quantum theory predicts the
violation of one of these inequalities for all $\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence,
nonlocality can be demonstrated with arbitrarily small limited detection
efficiencies. We validate this assumption experimentally via a twin-photon
implementation in which two users are provided with one photon each out of a
partially entangled pair. We exploit on each side a passive switch followed by
two measurement devices with fixed settings. Assuming the switches are not
fully controlled by an adversary, nor by hypothetical local variables, we
reveal the nonlocality of the established correlations despite a low overall
detection efficiency.

probed through measurements of the magnetization and magnetoconductivity around
the superconducting transition. The results, obtained with magnetic fields up

anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) approaches for finite applied magnetic fields.
The analysis allowed to determine with accuracy the out-of-plane, $\xi_c(0)$,

found between the $\xi_c(0)$ values resulting from electrical transport and
magnetization data. According to recent theoretical approaches, these

temperature also suggests that phase fluctuations, although possibly relevant
in other Fe-based superconductors, may play a negligible role in this compound.

A total of 106 sources were uncovered at 850 microns from ~150, sq. arcmin in
the centre of the COSMOS/UltraVISTA/CANDELS field, imaged to a typical rms
depth of ~0.25 mJy. We utilise the wealth of available deep multi-frequency
data to establish the complete redshift distribution for this sample, yielding
<z> = 2.38 +- 0.09, a mean redshift comparable with that derived for all but
the brightest previous sub-mm samples. We have also been able to establish the
stellar masses of the majority of the galaxy identifications, enabling us to
explore their location on the star-formation-rate:stellar-mass (SFR:M*) plane.
Crucially, our new deep sample reaches flux densities equivalent to SFR ~ 100

the `main sequence' (MS) of star-forming galaxies at z > 1.5 (with a mean
specific SFR of sSFR = 2.25 +- 0.19 /Gyr at z ~ 2.5). Our results are
consistent with no significant flattening of the MS towards high masses at
these redshifts, suggesting that reports of such flattening possibly arise from
under-estimates of dust-enshrouded star-formation activity in massive

SMGs, is dominated by synchrotron radiation arising from supernova activity.
Using deep, high-resolution ($1\sigma=2.3$ $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$; $0.75^{""}$) cm
radio-continuum observations taken by the VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project, we
studied the radio-emitting sizes of a flux-limited sample of SMGs in the COSMOS
field. Of the 39 SMGs studied here, 3 GHz emission was detected towards 18 of
them ($\sim46\pm11\%$) with S/N ratios in the range of ${\rm S/N=4.2-37.4}$.
Using 2D elliptical Gaussian fits, we derived a median deconvolved major axis
FWHM size of $0.54^{""}\pm 0.11^{""}$ for our 18 SMGs detected at 3 GHz. For the
15 SMGs with known redshift we derived a median linear major axis FWHM of
$4.2\pm0.9$ kpc. No clear correlation was found between the radio-emitting size
and the 3 GHz or submm flux density, or the redshift of the SMG. However, there
is a hint of larger radio sizes at $z\sim2.5-5$ compared to lower redshifts.
The sizes we derived are consistent with previous SMG sizes measured at 1.4 GHz
and in mid-$J$ CO emission, but significantly larger than those seen in the
(sub)mm continuum emission. One possible scenario is that SMGs have i) an
extended gas component with a low dust temperature, and which can be traced by
low- to mid-$J$ CO line emission and radio continuum emission, and ii) a
warmer, compact starburst region giving rise to the high-$J$ line emission of
CO, which could dominate the dust continuum size measurements. Because of the
rapid cooling of CR electrons in dense starburst galaxies ($\sim10^4-10^5$ yr),
the more extended synchrotron radio-emitting size being a result of CR
diffusion seems unlikely. Instead, if SMGs are driven by galaxy mergers the
radio synchrotron emission might arise from more extended magnetised ISM around
the starburst region.

exploit the property that such a sequence may be connected with the two
parameter $(\alpha,\theta)$ family of Poisson Dirichlet distributions. We
demonstrate that the sequences serve as limits in certain types of preferential
attachment models. As one illustrative application, we describe the explicit
joint limiting distribution of scaled degree sequences arising under a class of
linear weighted preferential attachment models as treated in M\'ori (2005),
with weight $\beta>-1.$ When $\beta=0$ this corresponds to the Barbasi-Albert
preferential attachment model. We then construct sequences of nested
$(\alpha,\theta)$ Chinese restaurant partitions of $[n]$. From this, we
identify and analyze relevant quantities that may be thought of as mimics for
vectors of degree sequences, or differences in tree lengths. We also describe
connections to a wide class of continuous time coalescent processes that can be
seen as a variation of stochastic flows of bridges related to generalized
Fleming-Viot models. Under a change of measure our results suggest the
possibilities for identification of limiting distributions related to
consistent families of nested Gibbs partitions of $[n]$ that would otherwise be
difficult by methods using moments or Laplace transforms. In this regard, we
focus on special simplifications obtained in the case of $\alpha=1/2.$ That is
to say, limits derived from a $\mathrm{PD}(1/2|t)$ distribution. Throughout we
present some distributional results that are relevant to various settings. We
describe nestings across the $\alpha$ parameter in section 6

capturing the low energy dynamics of closed strings on a torus. It renders
T-duality on a torus manifest by adding $D$ winding coordinates in addition to
the $D$ space time coordinates. An essential consistency constraint of the
theory, the strong constraint, only allows for field configurations which
depend on half of the coordinates of the arising doubled space. I derive
DFT${}_\mathrm{WZW}$, a generalization of the current formalism. It captures
the low energy dynamics of a closed bosonic string propagating on a compact
group manifold. Its classical action and the corresponding gauge
transformations arise from Closed String Field Theory up to cubic order in the
massless fields. These results are rewritten in terms of a generalized metric
and extended to all orders in the fields. There is an explicit distinction
between background and fluctuations. For the gauge algebra to close, the latter
have to fulfill a modified strong constraint, while for the former the weaker
closure constraint is sufficient. Besides the generalized diffeomorphism
invariance known from the original formulation, DFT${}_\mathrm{WZW}$ is
invariant under standard diffeomorphisms of the doubled space. They are broken
by imposing the totally optional extended strong constraint. In doing so, the
original formulation is restored. A flux formulation for the new theory is
derived and its connection to generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications is
discussed. Further, a possible tree-level uplift of a genuinely non-geometric
background (not T-dual to any geometric configuration) is presented. Finally, a
long standing problem, the missing of a prescription to construct the twist in
generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications, is solved. Altogether, a more

from the individual contingent claims market into the common pool while
shielding the market maker from potential financial loss. The contribution of
this paper is two-fold. First, we provide a new economic interpretation of the

variables $X\in\mathbb{R}^d$. The generalized regression model is flexible and
covers many widely used statistical models. It fits the data generating
mechanisms well in many real problems, which makes it useful in a variety of
applications where regression models are regularly employed. In low dimensions,
rank-based M-estimators are recommended to deal with the generalized regression
model, giving root-$n$ consistent estimators of $\beta^*$. Applications of
these estimators to high dimensional data, however, are questionable. This
article studies, both theoretically and practically, a simple yet powerful
smoothing approach to handle the high dimensional generalized regression model.
Theoretically, a family of smoothing functions is provided, and the amount of
smoothing necessary for efficient inference is carefully calculated.
Practically, our study is motivated by an important and challenging scientific
problem: decoding gene regulation by predicting transcription factors that bind
to cis-regulatory elements. Applying our proposed method to this problem shows
substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art alternative in real data.

reverse-mode automatic differentiation library designed to be usable, extensive

straightforward object-oriented framework for expressions, allowing users to
easily create custom functions. Efficiency is achieved through a combination of
custom memory management, subexpression caching, traits-based metaprogramming,
and expression templates. Partial derivatives for compound functions are
evaluated lazily for improved scalability. Stability is achieved by taking care

establishes a relation between loop-level and tree-level scattering amplitudes.
This is achieved by directly applying the Residue Theorem to the
loop-energy-integration. The result is a sum over all possible single cuts of
the Feynman diagram in consideration integrated over a modified phase space.
These single-cut integrals, called Dual contributions, are in fact tree-level
objects and thus give rise to the opportunity of bringing loop- and
tree-contributions together, treating them simultaneously in a common Monte
Carlo event generator. Initially introduced for one-loop scalar integrals, the
applicability of the LTD has been expanded ever since. In this thesis, we show
how to deal with Feynman graphs beyond simple poles by taking advantage of
Integration By Parts (IBP) relations. Furthermore, we investigate the
cancellation of singularities among Dual contributions as well as between real
and virtual corrections. For the first time, a numerical implementation of the
LTD was done in the form of a computer program that calculates one-loop
scattering diagrams. We present details on the contour deformation employed

scientists of the modern era: Charles Darwin. From the full-text of books

models to quantify his local (text-to-text) and global (text-to-past) reading

surprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure exploitation strategy, Darwin's
behavior shifts from early exploitation to later exploration, seeking unusually
high levels of cognitive surprise relative to previous eras. These shifts,
detected by an unsupervised Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual
epochs of his career as identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin's
own self-commentary. Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts
with their publication order. We find Darwin's consumption more exploratory
than the culture's production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal
changes are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery. Our
quantitative methods advance the study of cognitive search through a framework
for testing interactions between individual and collective behavior and between
short- and long-term consumption choices. This novel application of topic
modeling to characterize individual reading complements widespread studies of

relationship in the 21st century. Typically it is measured through opinion
polls, for example, by Gallup and Pew Institute. In this paper, we propose a
new method to measure U.S.-China relations using data from Twitter, one of the
most popular social networks. Compared with traditional opinion polls, our
method has two distinctive advantages. First, our sample size is significantly
larger. National opinion polls have at most a few thousand samples. Our data
set has 724,146 samples. The large size of our data set enables us to perform
state level analysis, which so far even large opinion polls have left
unexplored. Second, our method can control for fixed state and date effects. We
first demonstrate the existence of inter-state and inter-day variances and then
control for these variances in our regression analysis. Empirically, our study
is able to replicate the stylized results from opinion polls as well as
generate new insights. At the state level, we find New York, Michigan, Indiana
and Arizona are the top four most China-friendly states. Wyoming, South Dakota,
Kansas and Nevada are most homogeneous. At the individual level, we find
attitudes towards China improve as an individual's Twitter experience grows
longer and more intense. We also find individuals of Chinese ethnicity are
statistically more China-friendly.

specifying the second order properties of the random field. A scientist
developing a model for spatial data has a number of options regarding the
nature of the dependence between observations. One of these options is deciding
whether or not the dependence between observations depends on direction, or, in
other words, whether or not the spatial covariance function is isotropic.
Isotropy implies that spatial dependence is a function of only the distance and
not the direction of the spatial separation between sampling locations. A
researcher may use graphical techniques, such as directional sample
semivariograms, to determine whether an assumption of isotropy holds. These
graphical diagnostics can be difficult to assess, subject to personal
interpretation, and potentially misleading as they typically do not include a
measure of uncertainty. In order to escape these issues, a hypothesis test of
the assumption of isotropy may be more desirable. To avoid specification of the
covariance function, a number of nonparametric tests of isotropy have been
developed using both the spatial and spectral representations of random fields.
Several of these nonparametric tests are implemented in the R package spTest,
available on CRAN. We demonstrate how graphical techniques and the hypothesis
tests programmed in spTest can be used in practice to assess isotropy
properties.

reduced surface brightness range measured across their discs, when combined

determined by the fine atomic-scale details of the junction structure. As
experimental advances are progressively accessing transport and optical
characterization of smaller nanojunctions, a clear connection between the
structural, electronic and optical properties in these nanocavities is needed.
Using ab initio calculations, we present here a study of the simultaneous
evolution of the structure and the optical response of a plasmonic junction as
the particles forming the cavity, two Na$_{380}$ clusters, approach and
retract. Atomic reorganizations are responsible for a large hysteresis of the
plasmonic response of the system, that shows a jump-to-contact instability
during the approach process and the formation of an atom-sized neck across the
junction during retraction. Our calculations demonstrate that, due to the
quantization of the conductance in metal nanocontacts, atomic-scale
reconfigurations play a crucial role in determining the optical response of the
whole system. We observe abrupt changes in the intensities and spectral
positions of the dominating plasmon resonances, and find a one-to-one
correspondence between these jumps and those of the quantized transport as the
neck cross-section diminishes. These results point out to an unforeseen
connection between transport and optics at the atomic scale, which is at the
frontier of current optoelectronics and can drive new options in optical
engineering of signals driven by the motion and manipulation of single atoms.

the results of a semi-analytical model which simulates the evolution of the

conditions form planets in the HZ with masses from $0.66M_{\oplus}$ to
$2.27M_{\oplus}$. More realistic initial conditions obtained from a
semi-analytical model, form planets with masses between $1.18M_{\oplus}$ and

perform their biological roles. Motor protein phenomena have inspired
theoretical models of one-dimensional transport, crowding, and jamming.
Experiments studying the motion of Xklp1 motors on reconstituted antiparallel
microtubule overlaps demonstrated that motors recruited to the overlap walk
toward the plus end of individual microtubules and frequently switch between
filaments. We study a model of this system that couples the totally asymmetric
simple exclusion process (TASEP) for motor motion with switches between
antiparallel filaments and binding kinetics. We determine steady-state motor
density profiles for fixed-length overlaps using exact and approximate
solutions of the continuum differential equations and compare to kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations. Overlap motor density profiles and motor trajectories
resemble experimental measurements. The phase diagram of the model is similar
to the single-filament case for low switching rate, while for high switching
rate we find a new low density-high density-low density-high density phase. The
overlap center region, far from the overlap ends, has a constant motor density
as one would naively expect. However, rather than following a simple binding
equilibrium, the center motor density depends on total overlap length, motor
speed, and motor switching rate. The size of the crowded boundary layer near
the overlap ends is also dependent on the overlap length and switching rate in
addition to the motor speed and bulk concentration. The antiparallel
microtubule overlap geometry may offer a previously unrecognized mechanism for
biological regulation of protein concentration and consequent activity.

southern bright stars measured to a median sensitivity of $\sim$4.4 $\times

the previous PlanetPol survey of northern bright stars. This is attributed to a
dustier interstellar medium in the mid-plane of the Galaxy, together with a
population containing more B-type stars leading to more intrinsically polarised
stars, as well as using a wavelength more sensitive to intrinsic polarisation
in late-type giants. Significant polarisation had been identified for only six
stars in the survey group previously, whereas we are now able to deduce
intrinsic polarigenic mechanisms for more than twenty.
  The four most highly polarised stars in the sample are the four classical Be
stars ($\alpha$ Eri, $\alpha$ Col, $\eta$ Cen and $\alpha$ Ara). For the three
of these objects resolved by interferometry, the position angles are consistent
with the orientation of the circumstellar disc determined. We find significant
intrinsic polarisation in most B stars in the sample; amongst these are a
number of close binaries and an unusual binary debris disk system. However
these circumstances do not account for the high polarisations of all the B
stars in the sample and other polarigenic mechanisms are explored. Intrinsic
polarisation is also apparent in several late type giants which can be
attributed to either close, hot circumstellar dust or bright spots in the
photosphere of these stars. Aside from a handful of notable debris disk
systems, the majority of A to K type stars show polarisation levels consistent
with interstellar polarisation.

of the Oort cloud under the perturbing effects of the tide and 61 known stellar
encounters, we investigate the link between long-period comets and encounters.
We find that past encounters were responsible for injecting at least 5% of the
currently known long-period comets. This is a lower limit due to the
incompleteness of known encounters. Although the Galactic tide seems to play
the dominant role in producing the observed long-period comets, the non-uniform
longitude distribution of the cometary perihelia suggests the existence of
strong -- but as yet unidentified -- stellar encounters or other impulses. The
strongest individual future and past encounters are probably HIP 89825 (Gliese

long-period comets, respectively. Our results show that the strength of an
encounter can be approximated well by a simple proxy, which will be convenient

appropriately chosen robust covariance matrix estimators into the graphical
Lasso and CLIME. Such estimators were recently proposed in the robust
statistics literature, but only analyzed mathematically from the point of view
of the breakdown point. This paper provides complementary high-dimensional
error bounds for the precision matrix estimators that reveal the interplay
between the dimensionality of the problem and the degree of contamination
permitted in the observed distribution. We also show that although the
graphical Lasso and CLIME estimators perform equally well from the point of
view of statistical consistency, the breakdown property of the graphical Lasso
is superior to that of CLIME. We discuss implications of our work for problems
involving graphical model estimation when the uncontaminated data follow a
multivariate normal distribution, and the goal is to estimate the support of
the population-level precision matrix. Our error bounds do not make any
assumptions about the the contaminating distribution and allow for a

spiral arms in barred spiral galaxies using a three-dimensional (3D)
$N$-body/hydrodynamic simulation. Similar to previous numerical simulations of
unbarred, multiple-arm spirals, we find that grand-design spiral arms in barred
galaxies are not stationary, but rather dynamic. This means that the
amplitudes, pitch angles, and rotational frequencies of the spiral arms are not
constant, but change within a few hundred million years (i.e. the typical
rotational period of a galaxy). We also find that the clear grand-design
spirals in barred galaxies appear it only when the spirals connect with the
ends of the bar. Furthermore, we find that the short-term behaviour of spiral
arms in the outer regions ($R>$ 1.5--2 bar radius) can be explained by the
swing amplification theory and that the effects of the bar are not negligible
in the inner regions ($R<$ 1.5--2 bar radius). These results suggest that,
although grand-design spiral arms in barred galaxies are affected by the
stellar bar, the grand-design spiral arms essentially originate not as
bar-driven stationary density waves, but rather as self-excited dynamic
patterns. We imply that a rigidly rotating grand-design spiral could not be a
reasonable dynamical model for investigating gas flows and cloud formation even
in barred spiral galaxies.

stellar mass by combining CO literature data. We observe a stellar-mass
dependence of the f_mol evolution where massive galaxies have largely depleted
their molecular gas at z=1, whereas the f_mol value of less massive galaxies
drastically decreases from z=1. We compare the observed M_star-f_mol relation
with theoretical predictions from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and
semi-analytical models for galaxy formation. Although the theoretical studies
approximately reproduce the observed mass dependence of f_mol evolution, they
tend to underestimate the f_mol values, particularly of less massive (<10^10
Msun) and massive galaxies (>10^11 Msun) when compared with the observational

suppress the star formation while simultaneously preserving the molecular gas

Probabilistic image segmentation is increasingly popular as it captures
uncertainty in the results. Image segmentation methods that support
multi-region (as opposed to binary) delineation are more favourable as they
capture interactions between the different objects in the image. The Dice
similarity coefficient (DSC) has been a popular metric for evaluating the
accuracy of automated or semi-automated segmentation methods by comparing their
results to the ground truth. In this work, we develop an extension of the DSC
to multi-region probabilistic segmentations (with unordered labels). We use
bipartite graph matching to establish label correspondences and propose two
functions that extend the DSC, one based on absolute probability differences
and one based on the Aitchison distance. These provide a robust and accurate
measure of multi-region probabilistic segmentation accuracy.

The simulations indicate that CRs alone can launch and sustain strong outflows

solar neighborhood conditions and with a CR energy injection per SN of 10^50

mean value and the fluctuations of the pseudo-$T_c$ scale with the same
exponent, the correlation length exponent $\nu_r$ (for which we provide the
refined evaluation $\nu_r=2.9 \pm 0.4$). This result (coherent with the typical
picture that describes random ferromagnets, when disorder is relevant) is at
variance with numerical results reported in the literature for the PS model
with self-avoidance, leading to an alternative scenario with a pseudo first
order transition. We moreover introduce a crossover chain length $N^*$, which
we evaluate, appropriate for characterizing the approach to the asymptotic
regime in this model. Essentially, below $N^*$, the behaviour of the model in
our study could also agree with such alternative scenario. Based on an
approximate prediction of the dependence of $N^*$ on the parameters of the
model, we show that following the choice of such parameters it could be not
possible to reach the asymptotic regime in practice. In such context it becomes
then possible to reconcile the apparently contradictory numerical studies.

channel capacities of the two-user broadcast channel where each user (receiver)

Since the link qualities of the channels from the base station to the two users
are different, their respective single-user non-broadcast channel capacities
are also different. A goal is to simultaneously achieve/approach the
single-user non-broadcast channel capacities of the two users with a single
broadcast transmission by applying network coding. This is referred to as the
\emph{rate-diverse wireless network coding} problem. For this problem, this
paper presents a capacity-achieving framework based on linear- structured
nested lattice codes. The significance of the proposed framework, besides its
theoretical optimality, is that it suggests a general design principle for
linear rate-diverse wireless network coding going beyond the use of lattice
codes. We refer to this design principle as the \emph{principle of virtual
single-user channels}. Guided by this design principle, we propose two
implementations of our encoding/decoding framework using practical linear codes
amenable to decoding with affordable complexities: the first implementation is
based on Low Density Lattice Codes (LDLC) and the second implementation is
based on Bit-interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM). These two implementations
demonstrate the validity and performance advantage of our framework.

  single-neuron excitability: A modeling study",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a
large number of genetic risk factors for schizophrenia (SCZ) featuring ion
channels and calcium transporters. For some of these risk factors, independent
prior investigations have examined the effects of genetic alterations on the
cellular electrical excitability and calcium homeostasis. In the present
proof-of-concept study, we harnessed these experimental results for modeling of
computational properties on layer V cortical pyramidal cell and identify
possible common alterations in behavior across SCZ-related genes.
  Methods: We applied a biophysically detailed multi-compartmental model to
study the excitability of a layer V pyramidal cell. We reviewed the literature
on functional genomics for variants of genes associated with SCZ, and used
changes in neuron model parameters to represent the effects of these variants.
  Results: We present and apply a framework for examining the effects of subtle
single nucleotide polymorphisms in ion channel and Ca2+ transporter-encoding
genes on neuron excitability. Our analysis indicates that most of the
considered SCZ- related genetic variants affect the spiking behavior and
intracellular calcium dynamics resulting from summation of inputs across the
dendritic tree.
  Conclusions: Our results suggest that alteration in the ability of a single
neuron to integrate the inputs and scale its excitability may constitute a
fundamental mechanistic contributor to mental disease, alongside with the
previously proposed deficits in synaptic communication and network behavior.

important of which is geometrical thinness. Whenever this condition is
violated, new physical effects become important such as radial energy advection
and mass loss from the disc. These effects are important, for instance, for
large mass accretion rates when the disc approaches its local Eddington limit.
In this work, we study the upper limits for standard accretion disc
approximation and find the corrections to the standard model that should be
considered in any model aiming on reproducing the transition to super-Eddington
accretion regime. First, we find that for thin accretion disc, taking into
account relativistic corrections allows to increase the local Eddington limit
by about a factor of two due to stronger gravity in General Relativity (GR).
However, violation of the local Eddington limit also means large disc
thickness. To consider consequently the disc thickness effects, one should make
assumptions upon the two-dimensional rotation law of the disc. For rotation
frequency constant on cylinders $r\sin\theta=const$, vertical gravity becomes
stronger with height on spheres of constant radius. On the other hand, effects
of radial flux advection increase the flux density in the inner parts of the
disc and lower the Eddington limit. In general, the effects connected to disc
thickness tend to increase the local Eddington limit even more. The efficiency
of accretion is however decreased by advection effects by about a factor of
several.

transition threshold, none of the sample eigenvalues separate from the bulk,
making the testing problem challenging. Using a unified strategy for the six

value of the sub-critical spike converge to Gaussian processes with logarithmic
correlation. We then derive asymptotic power envelopes for tests for the

conditions in the form of the microcanonical density matrix for the
cosmological model with a large number of quantum fields conformally coupled to
gravity. Initial conditions for inflation are set up by cosmological instantons
describing underbarrier oscillations in the vicinity of the inflaton potential
maximum. These periodic oscillations of the inflaton field and cosmological
scale factor are obtained within the approximation of two coupled oscillators
subject to the slow roll regime in the Euclidean time. This regime is
characterized by rapid oscillations of the scale factor on the background of a
slowly varying inflaton, which guarantees smallness of slow roll parameters
$\epsilon$ and $\eta$ of the following inflation stage. A hill-like shape of
the inflaton potential is shown to be generated by logarithmic loop corrections
to the tree-level asymptotically shift-invariant potential in the non-minimal
Higgs inflation model and $R^2$-gravity. The solution to the problem of
hierarchy between the Planckian scale and the inflation scale is discussed
within the concept of conformal higher spin fields, which also suggests the
mechanism bringing the model below the gravitational cutoff and, thus,
protecting it from large graviton loop corrections.

that the same law continues to hold even for ages over 100. Beyond 106 there is
so far no statistical evidence available because the number of survivors is too
small even in the largest nations. However assuming that Gompertz's law
continues to hold beyond 106, we conclude that the mortality rate becomes equal
to 1 at age 120 (meaning that there are 1,000 deaths in a population of one
thousand). In other words, the upper bound of human life is near 120. The
existence of this fixed-point has interesting implications. It allows us to
predict the form of the relationship between death rates at age 35 and the
doubling time of Gompertz's law. In order to test this prediction, we first
carry out a transversal analysis for a sample of countries comprising both
industrialized and developing nations. As further confirmation, we also develop
a longitudinal analysis using historical data over a time period of almost two
centuries. Another prediction arising from this fixed-point model, is that,
above a given population threshold, the lifespan of the oldest person is
independent of the size of her national community. This prediction is supported

riddled with problems. This paper considers theoretical physics of thermalized
systems as it is done in practise and shows that all approaches to thermalized

deterministic time evolution. These considerations include, among others, the
classical limit, extensivity, the concepts of entropy and equilibrium, and
symmetry breaking in phase transitions and quantum measurement. As a
conclusion, the paper argues that the irreversibility and stochasticity of

represented by a collection of $N$ wave packets of a size of the order of the

strong error-reducible properties of such quantum computations. It is proved
that any problem solvable by a polynomial-time quantum computation with
one-sided bounded error that uses logarithmically many clean qubits can also be
solvable with exponentially small one-sided error using just two clean qubits,
and with polynomially small one-sided error using just one clean qubit. It is
further proved in the case of two-sided bounded error that any problem solvable

using logarithmically many clean qubits can also be solvable with exponentially
small two-sided error using just two clean qubits. If only one clean qubit is
available, the problem is again still solvable with exponentially small error

stacked-up from conveyor belts onto pallets. Given k sequences of labeled bins
and a positive integer p, the goal is to stack-up the bins by iteratively
removing the first bin of one of the k sequences and put it onto a pallet
located at one of p stack-up places. The FIFO Stack-Up problem asks whether
there is some processing of the sequences of bins such that at most p stack-up
places are used. In this paper we strengthen the hardness of the FIFO Stack-Up
by considering practical cases and the distribution of the pallets onto the
sequences. We introduce a digraph model for this problem, the so called
decision graph, which allows us to give a breadth first search solution.
Further we apply methods to solve hard problems to the FIFO Stack-Up problem.
In order to evaluate our algorithms, we introduce a method to generate random,
but realistic instances for the FIFO Stack-Up problem. Our experimental study
of running times shows that the breadth first search solution on the decision
graph combined with a cutting technique can be used to solve practical
instances on several thousands of bins of the FIFO Stack-Up problem. Further we
analyze two integer programming approaches implemented in CPLEX and GLPK. As
expected CPLEX can solve the instances much faster than GLPK and our pallet
solution approach is much better than the bin solution approach.

measures of proximity. These measures, however, are influenced by factors of
the patenting system that do not reflect technologies or their proximity. We
introduce a method to precisely normalize out multiple impinging factors in
patent data and extract the true signal of technological proximity, by
comparing the empirical proximity measures with what they would be in random
situations that remove the impinging factors. With this method, we created
technology networks, using data from 3.9 million patents. After normalization,
different measures of proximity became more correlated with each other,
approaching a single dimension of technological proximity. The normalized
technology networks were sparse, with few pairs of technology domains being
significantly related. The normalized network corresponded with human behavior:
we analyzed the patenting histories of 2.8 million inventors and found they
were more likely to invent in two different technology domains if the pair was
closely related in the technology network. We also analyzed 250 thousand firms'
patents and found that, in contrast, firms' inventive activities were only
modestly associated with the technology network; firms' portfolios combined
pairs of technology domains about twice as often as inventors. These results
suggest that controlling for impinging factors provides meaningful measures of
technological proximity for patent-based mapping of the technology space, and
that this map can be used to aid in technology innovation planning and

underdoped cuprate superconductors for temperature $T<T^{*}$, we propose a
four-component pair density wave (PDW) state, in which all components compete
with each other. Without random field disorders (RFD), only one of the PDW
components survives. If the RFD is included, this state could become phase
separated and consist of short range PDW stripes, in which two PDW components
coexist but differ in magnitudes, resulting in charge density waves (CDW) and a
time-reversal symmetry breaking order, in the form of loop current, as
secondary composite orders. We call this phase-separated pair nematic (PSPN)
state, which could be responsible for the pseudogap. Using a phenomenological
Ginzburg-Landau approach and Monte Carlo simulations, we found that in this
state, RFD induces short range static CDW with phase-separated patterns in the
directional components and the static CDW is destroyed by thermal phase
fluctuations at a crossover temperature $T_{CO}<T^{*}$, above which the CDW
becomes dynamically fluctuating. The experimentally found CDW with
predominantly d-wave form factor constrains the PDW components to have
$s^{\prime}\pm id$ pairing symmetries. We also construct a lattice model and

trains an ensemble of clusterings by data resampling, and produces sparse codes
from the clusterings by one-nearest-neighbor optimization plus binarization.
The main advantage of UBSC is that it does not suffer from local minima and
does not make Gaussian assumptions on data distributions. We evaluated UBSC on

reported by ALICE to more peripheral collisions. No strong change of the
charged-particle pseudorapidity density distributions with centrality is
observed, and when normalised to the number of participating nucleons in the
collisions, the evolution over pseudorapidity with centrality is likewise
small. The broad pseudorapidity range allows precise estimates of the total
number of produced charged particles which we find to range from $162\pm22$
(syst.) to $17170\pm770$ (syst.) in 80-90% and 0-5 central collisions,

scale with the number of participating nucleons in the collision. This suggests
that hard contributions to the charged-particle multiplicity are limited. The
results are compared to models which describe
$\mbox{d}N_{\mbox{ch}}/\mbox{d}\eta$ at mid-rapidity in the most central Pb-Pb

non-equilibrium systems. Their verification requires the measurement of the
total work (or entropy production) performed on a system. Nevertheless in many
cases only a partial measurement of the work is possible. Here we consider FRs
in dual-trap optical tweezers where two different forces (one per trap) are
measured. With this setup we perform pulling experiments on single molecules by
moving one trap relative to the other. We demonstrate that work should be
measured using the force exerted by the trap that is moved. The force that is
measured in the trap at rest fails to provide the full dissipation in the
system leading to a (incorrect) work definition that does not satisfy the FR.
The implications to single-molecule experiments and free energy measurements
are discussed. In the case of symmetric setups a new work definition, based on
differential force measurements, is introduced. This definition is best suited
to measure free energies as it shows faster convergence of estimators. We
discuss measurements using the (incorrect) work definition as an example of
partial work measurement. We show how to infer the full work distribution from
the partial one via the FR. The inference process does also yield quantitative
information, e.g. the hydrodynamic drag on the dumbbell. Results are also
obtained for asymmetric dual-trap setups. We suggest that this kind of
inference could represent a new and general application of FRs to extract

systems subjected to unknown uncertainties is addressed and an adaptive-robust
control strategy, christened as Time-Delayed Adaptive Robust Control (TARC) is
presented. The proposed control strategy approximates the unknown dynamics
through time-delayed logic, and the switching logic provides robustness against
the approximation error. The novel adaptation law for the switching gain, in
contrast to the conventional adaptive-robust control methodologies, does not
require either nominal modelling or predefined bounds of the uncertainties.
Also, the proposed adaptive law circumvents the overestimation-underestimation
problem of switching gain. The state derivatives in the proposed control law is
estimated from past data of the state to alleviate the measurement error when
state derivatives are not available directly. Moreover, a new stability notion
for time-delayed control is proposed which in turn provides a selection
criterion for controller gain and sampling interval. Experimental result of the
proposed methodology using a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot (WMR) is
presented and improved tracking accuracy of the proposed control law is noted

set as the flat state) for general magnetic permeabilities. Using numerical
continuation techniques we investigate the existence of localized hexagons in
the Young-Laplace equation coupled to the Maxwell equations. We find cellular
hexagons possess a Maxwell point providing an energetic explanation for the
multitude of measured hexagon patches. Furthermore, it is found that planar
hexagon fronts and hexagon patches undergo homoclinic snaking corroborating the
experimentally detected intervals. Besides making a contribution to the
specific area of ferrofluids, our work paves the ground for a deeper
understanding of homoclinic snaking of 2D localized patches of cellular
patterns in many physical systems.

These depend sensitively on the number of finite moments of the weight
distribution. When the fourth moment of the weight distribution converges, then
the critical behavior is the same as on the (homogeneous) Curie-Weiss model, so
that the inhomogeneity is weak. When the fourth moment of the weights converges
to infinity, and the weights satisfy an asymptotic power law with exponent
$\tau$ with $\tau\in(3,5)$, then the critical exponents depend sensitively on

millimeter wave (mmWave) communications in the 60 GHz band has been considered
as one of the most promising candidates to support multi-gigabit wireless
services. Due to high propagation loss of mmWave channels, beamforming is
likely to become adopted as an essential technique. Consequently, transmission
in 60 GHz band is inherently directional. Directivity enables concurrent
transmissions (spatial reuse), which can be fully exploited to improve network
capacity. In this paper, we propose a multiple paths multi-hop scheduling
scheme, termed MPMH, for mmWave wireless personal area networks, where the
traffic across links of low channel quality is transmitted through multiple
paths of multiple hops to unleash the potential of spatial reuse. We formulate
the problem of multiple paths multi-hop scheduling as a mixed integer linear
program (MILP), which is generally NP-hard. To enable the implementation of the
multiple paths multi-hop transmission in practice, we propose a heuristic
scheme including path selection, traffic distribution, and multiple paths
multi-hop scheduling to efficiently solve the formulated problem. Finally,
through extensive simulations, we demonstrate MPMH achieves near-optimal
network performance in terms of transmission delay and throughput, and enhances
the network performance significantly compared with existing protocols.

sells a storable product to forward-looking consumers. In this framework, the
two major pricing policies (or mechanisms) studied in the literature are the
preannounced (commitment) pricing policy and the contingent (threat or history
dependent) pricing policy. We analyse and compare these pricing policies in the
setting where the good can be purchased along a finite time horizon in
indivisible atomic quantities. First, we show that, given linear storage costs,
the retailer can compute an optimal preannounced pricing policy in polynomial
time by solving a dynamic program. Moreover, under such a policy, we show that
consumers do not need to store units in order to anticipate price rises.
Second, under the contingent pricing policy rather than the preannounced
pricing mechanism, (i) prices could be lower, (ii) retailer revenues could be
higher, and (iii) consumer surplus could be higher. This result is surprising,
in that these three facts are in complete contrast to the case of a retailer
selling divisible storable goods Dudine et al. (2006). Third, we quantify
exactly how much more profitable a contingent policy could be with respect to a
preannounced policy. Specifically, for a market with $N$ consumers, a
contingent policy can produce a multiplicative factor of $\Omega(\log N)$ more
revenues than a preannounced policy, and this bound is tight.

policies which minimize the impact of charging on the electricity distribution
network (DN). More precisely, the considered cost function results from a
linear combination of two parts: a cost with memory and a memoryless cost. In
this paper, the first component is identified to be the transformer ageing
while the second one corresponds to distribution Joule losses. First, we
formulate the problem as a non-trivial discrete-time optimal control problem
with finite time horizon. It is non-trivial because of the presence of
saturation constraints and a non-quadratic cost. It turns out that the system
state, which is the transformer hot-spot (HS) temperature here, can be
expressed as a function of the sequence of control variables; the cost function
is then seen to be convex in the control for typical values for the model
parameters. The problem of interest thus becomes a standard optimization
problem. While the corresponding problem can be solved by using available
numerical routines, three distributed charging policies are provided. The
motivation is threefold: to decrease the computational complexity; to model the
important scenario where the charging profile is chosen by the EV itself; to
circumvent the allocation problem which arises with the proposed formulation.
Remarkably, the performance loss induced by decentralization is verified to be
small through simulations. Numerical results show the importance of the choice
of the charging policies. For instance, the gain in terms of transformer
lifetime can be very significant when implementing advanced charging policies
instead of plug-and-charge policies. The impact of the accuracy of the non-EV
demand forecasting is equally assessed.

  unique decoding radius",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compared with classical block codes, efficient list decoding of rank-metric
codes seems more difficult. Although the list decodability of random
rank-metric codes and limits to list decodability have been completely
determined, little work on efficient list decoding rank-metric codes has been
done. The only known efficient list decoding of rank-metric codes $\mC$ gives
decoding radius up to the Singleton bound $1-R-\Ge$ with positive rate $R$ when
$\rho(\mC)$ is extremely small, i.e., $\Theta(\Ge^2)$ , where $\rho(\mC)$
denotes the ratio of the number of rows over the number of columns of $\mC$
\cite[STOC2013]{Guru2013}. It is commonly believed that list decoding of
rank-metric codes $\mC$ with not small constant ratio $\rho(\mC)$ is hard.
  The main purpose of the present paper is to explicitly construct a class of
rank-metric codes $\mC$ with not small constant ratio $\rho(\mC)$ and
efficiently list decode these codes with decoding radius beyond $(1-R)/2$. Our
key idea is to employ two-variable polynomials $f(x,y)$, where $f$ is
linearized in variable $x$ and the variable $y$ is used to ""fold"" the code. In
other words, rows are used to correct rank errors and columns are used to
""fold"" the code to enlarge decoding radius. Apart from the above algebraic
technique, we have to prune down the list. The algebraic idea enables us to pin
down the messages into a structured subspace of dimension linear in the number
$n$ of columns. This ""periodic"" structure allows us to pre-encoding the
messages to prune down the list. More precisely, we use subspace design
introduced in \cite[STOC2013]{Guru2013} to get a deterministic algorithm with a
larger constant list size and employ hierarchical subspace-evasive sets
introduced in \cite[STOC2012]{Guru2012} to obtain a randomized algorithm with a
smaller constant list size.

firm that in each period of a finite horizon receives replenishment quantities
of a single product which it sells in two markets, e.g., a long-distance market
and an on-site market. The key difference between the two markets is that the
long-distance market provides for a one period delay in demand fulfillment. In
contrast, on-site orders must be filled immediately as the customer is at the
physical on-site location. We model the demands in consecutive periods as
independent random variables and their distributions depend on the item's price
in accordance with two general stochastic demand functions: additive or
multiplicative.
  The firm uses a single pool of inventory to fulfill demands from both
markets. We investigate properties of the structure of the dynamic pricing
strategy that maximizes the total expected discounted profit over the finite
time horizon, under fixed or controlled replenishment conditions. Further, we
provide conditions under which one market may be the preferred outlet to sale

transmission rates. In this case, device-to-device (D2D) communications in
mmWave bands should be fully exploited due to no interference with the
macrocell networks and higher achievable transmission rates. In addition, due
to less interference by directional transmission, multiple links including D2D

popularity of content-based mobile applications, popular content downloading in
the small cells needs to be optimized to improve network performance and
enhance user experience. In this paper, we develop an efficient scheduling
scheme for popular content downloading in mmWave small cells, termed PCDS
(popular content downloading scheduling), where both D2D communications in
close proximity and concurrent transmissions are exploited to improve
transmission efficiency. In PCDS, a transmission path selection algorithm is
designed to establish multi-hop transmission paths for users, aiming at better
utilization of D2D communications and concurrent transmissions. After
transmission path selection, a concurrent transmission scheduling algorithm is
designed to maximize the spatial reuse gain. Through extensive simulations
under various traffic patterns, we demonstrate PCDS achieves near-optimal
performance in terms of delay and throughput, and also superior performance
compared with other existing protocols, especially under heavy load.

networks is given by the simultaneous presence of aggregators and individual
consumers. In this work, an aggregator is seen as an entity (a coalition) which
is able to manage jointly the energy demand of a large group of consumers or
users. More precisely, the demand consists in charging an electrical vehicle
(EV) battery. The way the EVs user charge their batteries matters since it
strongly impacts the network, especially the distribution network costs (e.g.,
in terms of Joule losses or transformer ageing). Since the charging policy is
chosen by the users or the aggregators, the charging problem is naturally
distributed. It turns out that one of the tools suited to tackle this
heterogenous scenario has been introduced only recently namely, through the
notion of composite games. This paper exploits for the first time in the
literature of smart grids the notion of composite game and equilibrium. By
assuming a rectangular charging profile for an EV, a composite equilibrium
analysis is conducted, followed by a detailed analysis of a case study which
assumes three possible charging periods or time-slots. Both the provided
analytical and numerical results allow one to better understand the
relationship between the size (which is a measure) of the coalition and the
network sum-cost. In particular, a social dilemma, a situation where everybody
prefers unilaterally defecting to cooperating, while the consequence is the
worst for all, is exhibited.

choosing the time at which it starts charging its battery in order to minimize
an individual cost which is mainly related to the total power delivered by the
transformer, the location of the time interval over which the charging
operation is performed, and the charging duration needed for the considered EV
to have its battery fully recharged. As individual cost functions are assumed
to be memoryless, it is possible to show that the game of interest is always an
ordinal potential game. More precisely, both an atomic and nonatomic versions
of the charging game are considered. In both cases, equilibrium analysis is
conducted. In particular, important issues such as equilibrium uniqueness and
efficiency are tackled. Interestingly, both analytical and numerical results
show that the efficiency loss due to decentralization (e.g., when cost
functions such as distribution network Joule losses or life of residential
distribution transformers when no thermal inertia is assumed) induced by
charging is small and the corresponding ""efficiency"", a notion close to the

structure the business and its alignment with the IT systems. One of the
popular enterprise architecture frameworks is Zachman framework (ZF). This
framework focuses on describing the enterprise from six viewpoint perspectives
of the stakeholders. These six perspectives are based on English language
interrogatives 'what', 'where', 'who', 'when', 'why', and 'how' (thus the term
W5H Journalists and police investigators use the W5H to describe an event.
However, EA is not an event, creation and evolution of EA challenging.
Moreover, the ordering of viewpoints is not defined in the existing EA
frameworks, making data capturing process difficult. Our goals are to 1) assess
if W5H is sufficient to describe modern EA and 2) explore the ordering and
precedence among the viewpoint concerns. Method: we achieve our goals by
bringing tools from the Linguistics, focusing on a full set of English Language
interrogatives to describe viewpoint concerns and the inter-relationships and
dependencies among these. Application of these tools is validated using
pedagogical EA examples. Results: 1) We show that addition of the seventh
interrogative 'which' to the W5H set (we denote this extended set as W6H)
yields extra and necessary information enabling creation of holistic EA. 2) We
discover that particular ordering of the interrogatives, established by
linguists (based on semantic and lexical analysis of English language
interrogatives), define starting points and the order in which viewpoints
should be arranged for creating complete EA. 3) We prove that adopting W6H
enables creation of EA for iterative and agile SDLCs, e.g. Scrum. Conclusions:
We believe that our findings complete creation of EA using ZF by practitioners,
and provide theoreticians with tools needed to improve other EA frameworks,
e.g., TOGAF and DoDAF.

attracted intense interests recently. The ambient TaAs has two types of Weyl
nodes which are not on the same energy level. As an effective way to tune
lattice parameters and electronic interactions, high pressure is becoming a
significant tool to explore new materials as well as their exotic states.
Therefore, it is highly interesting to investigate the behaviors of topological
Weyl fermions and possible structural phase transitions in TaAs under pressure.
Here, with a combination of ab initio calculations and crystal structure
prediction techniques, a new hexagonal P-6m2 phase is predicted in TaAs at
pressure around 14 GPa. Surprisingly, this new phase is a topological semimetal
with only single set of Weyl nodes exactly on the same energy level. The phase
transition pressure from the experimental measurements, including electrical
transport measurements and Raman spectroscopy, agrees with our theoretical
prediction reasonably. Moreover, the P-6m2 phase seems to be quenched
recoverable to ambient pressure, which increases the possibilities of further
study on the exotic behaviors of single set of Weyl fermions, such as the
interplay between surface states and other properties.

observed in a subset of Ly{\alpha} emitting galaxies, which have been difficult
to explain with conventional shell-models. Blue bumps can be produced with an
additional column density of static hydrogen as small as $N_{HI}^{static} \ll
N_{HI}^{shell}$, and typically occur at roughly the outflow velocity of the

an evolutionary stage in which the outflows regulating the escape of Ly{\alpha}

HXP can be divided into two groups by their temperature variations: those with
gradually decreasing temperature and those with rapidly decreasing temperature.
HXPs plasma temperatures lie in the range of 5-40 MK, the emission measure is
$10^{45}$- $10^{48}$ cm$^{-3}$, and the electron density is above $10^{10}$
cm$^{-3}$, which exceeds the electron density in the quiet Sun ($10^8$-$10^9$

than the conductive cooling time. This means that throughout a HXP's lifetime,
the energy release process continues, which helps to maintain its high
temperature. A HXP's thermal energy is not greater than $10^{28}$ erg, and the
total energy, which is released in HXPs, does not exceed $10^{30}$ erg. HXPs
differ in their physical properties from other flare-like microevents, such as
microflares, X-ray bright points, and nanoflares.

a class of systems with bounded energy and such that the second derivative of
$S_B$ with respect to energy is always negative: the second request is quite
natural and holds in systems of obvious relevance, i.e. with a number $N$ of
degrees of freedom sufficiently large (examples are shown where $N \sim 100$ is
sufficient) and without long-range interactions. We first discuss the basic
role of $T_B$, even when negative, as the parameter describing fluctuations of
observables in a sub-system. Then, we focus on how $T_B$ can be measured
dynamically, i.e. averaging over a single long experimental trajectory. On the
contrary, the same approach cannot be used in a generic system for $T_G$, since
the equipartition theorem may be spoiled by boundary effects due to the limited
energy. These general results are substantiated by the numerical study of a
Hamiltonian model of interacting rotators with bounded kinetic energy. The
numerical results confirm that the kind of configurational order realized in
the regions at small $S_B$, or equivalently at small $|T_B|$, depends on the

determines a word map from $U(n)^r$ to $U(n)$, defined by substitutions. The
$w$-measure on $U(n)$ is defined as the pushforward via this word map of the
Haar measure on $U(n)^r$.
  Let $Tr_w(n)$ denote the expected trace of a random unitary matrix sampled
from $U(n)$ according to the $w$-measure. It was shown by Voiculescu [Voic 91']
that for $w \ne 1$ this expected trace is $o(n)$ asymptotically in $n$. We
relate the numbers $Tr_w(n)$ to the theory of commutator length of words and
obtain a much stronger statement: $Tr_w(n)=O(n^{1-2g})$, where $g$ is the
commutator length of $w$. Moreover, we analyze the number
$\lim_{n\to\infty}n^{2g-1} \cdot Tr_w(n)$ and show it is an integer which,
roughly, counts the number of (equivalence classes of) solutions to the
equation $[u_1,v_1]...[u_g,v_g]=w$ with $u_i,v_i \in F_r$.

stability of a ring bound to an annular elastic substrate, which contains a
circular cavity. The system is loaded by depressurizing the inner cavity. The
ring is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam and its equilibrium equations are
derived from the mechanical energy which takes into account both stretching and
bending contributions. The curvature of the substrate is considered explicitly
to model the work done by its reaction force on the ring. We distinguish two
different instabilities: periodic wrinkling of the ring or global buckling of
the structure. Our model provides an expression for the critical pressure, as
well as a phase diagram that rationalizes the transition between instability
modes. Towards assessing the role of curvature, we compare our results for the
critical stress and the wrinkling wavelength to their planar counterparts. We
show that the critical stress is insensitive to the curvature of the substrate,
while the wavelength is only affected due to the permissible discrete values of
the azimuthal wavenumber imposed by the geometry of the problem. Throughout, we
contrast our analytical predictions against finite element simulations.

their neighbors, in order to guarantee that their application performance is
not affected by other tenants. Unfortunately, while shared clouds can offer an
option whereby tenants obtain dedicated servers, they do not offer any network
provisioning service, which would shield these tenants from network
interference. In this paper, we introduce Links as a Service, a new abstraction
for cloud service that provides physical isolation of network links. Each
tenant gets an exclusive set of links forming a virtual fat tree, and is
guaranteed to receive the exact same bandwidth and delay as if it were alone in
the shared cloud. Under simple assumptions, we derive theoretical conditions
for enabling LaaS without capacity over-provisioning in fat-trees. New tenants
are only admitted in the network when they can be allocated hosts and links
that maintain these conditions. Using experiments on real clusters as well as
simulations with real-life tenant sizes, we show that LaaS completely avoids
the performance degradation caused by traffic from concurrent tenants on shared
links. Compared to mere host isolation, LaaS can improve the application
performance by up to 200%, at the cost of a 10% reduction in the cloud
utilization.

geometrodynamical approach given by the Wheeler--DeWitt (WDW) equation. The
classical model is based on a Friedmann--Lema\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker
Universe filled by a perfect fluid that can be mapped to a scalar field with
phantom character. We analyse the WDW equation in two setups. In the first
step, we consider the scale factor as the single degree of freedom, which from
a classical perspective parametrises both the geometry and the matter content
given by the perfect fluid. We then solve the WDW equation within a WKB
approximation, for two factor ordering choices. On the second approach, we
consider the WDW equation with two degrees of freedom: the scale factor and a
scalar field. We solve the WDW equation, with the Laplace--Beltrami
factor-ordering, using a Born--Oppenheimer approximation. In both approaches,
we impose the DeWitt (DW) condition as a potential criterion for singularity
avoidance. We conclude that in all the cases analysed the DW condition can be
verified, which might be an indication that the LSBR can be avoided or smoothed

(LSB, central surface brightness $23\lesssim \mu_r\lesssim 26$) dwarf galaxy
candidates in one deep Virgo field of just $576$ arcmin$^2$ obtained by the
Large Binocular Camera (LBC) at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Their
association with the Virgo cluster is supported by their distinct position in
the central surface brightness - total magnitude plane with respect to the
background galaxies of similar total magnitude. They have typical absolute
magnitudes and scale sizes, if at the distance of Virgo, in the range
$-13\lesssim M_r\lesssim -9$ and $250\lesssim r_s\lesssim 850$ pc,
respectively. Their colors are consistent with a gradually declining star
formation history with a specific star formation rate of the order of
$10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, i.e. 10 times lower than that of main sequence star
forming galaxies. They are older than the cluster formation age and appear
regular in morphology. They represent the faintest extremes of the population
of low luminosity LSB dwarfs that has been recently detected in wider surveys
of the Virgo cluster. Thanks to the depth of our observations we are able to
extend the Virgo luminosity function down to $M_r\sim -9.3$ (corresponding to
total masses $M\sim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$), finding an average faint-end slope
$\alpha\simeq -1.4$. This relatively steep slope puts interesting constraints
on the nature of the Dark Matter and in particular on warm Dark Matter (WDM)
often invoked to solve the overprediction of the dwarf number density by the
standard CDM scenario. We derive a lower limit on the WDM particle mass $>1.5$
keV.

The first is \textsc{List Digraph Homomorphism}: given two digraphs $G$ and $H$
and a list of allowed vertices of $H$ for every vertex of $G$, the question is
whether there exists a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ respecting the list
constraints. The second problem is a variant of \textsc{Multiway Cut}, namely
\textsc{Min-Max Multiway Cut}: given a graph $G$, a non-negative integer
$\ell$, and a set $T$ of $r$ terminals, the question is whether we can
partition the vertices of $G$ into $r$ parts such that (a) each part contains
one terminal and (b) there are at most $\ell$ edges with only one endpoint in
this part. We parameterize \textsc{List Digraph Homomorphism} by the number $w$
of edges of $G$ that are mapped to non-loop edges of $H$ and we give a time
$2^{O(\ell\cdot\log h+\ell^2\cdot \log \ell)}\cdot n^{4}\cdot \log n$
algorithm, where $h$ is the order of the host graph $H$. We also prove that
\textsc{Min-Max Multiway Cut} can be solved in time $2^{O((\ell r)^2\log \ell
r)}\cdot n^{4}\cdot \log n$. Our approach introduces a general problem, called
{\sc List Allocation}, whose expressive power permits the design of
parameterized reductions of both aforementioned problems to it. Then our
results are based on an {\sf FPT}-algorithm for the {\sc List Allocation}
problem that is designed using a suitable adaptation of the {\em randomized
contractions} technique (introduced by [Chitnis, Cygan, Hajiaghayi, Pilipczuk,

the dynamics: flow (differential equations), map (discrete-time dynamics),
local-time update flow, and local-time update map. The presence of only
bilinear interactions prevent the flow cases to develop any dynamical
instability, the system converging always to the thermal equilibrium. The
situation is different for the map when unfriendly couplings are involved,
where period-two oscillations arise. In the case of the map with local-time
updates, oscillations of any period and chaos can arise as a consequence of the
reciprocal ""tension"" accumulated among the communities during their sleeping

characterized by positive Lyapunov exponent and bifurcation cascades, or
marginal chaos characterized by zero Lyapunov exponent and critical continuous

refinement is anisotropic and constrained by measurements of local Poincar\'e

and engineering applications. However, natural materials with isotropic
negative thermal expansion are rare and usually unsatisfied in performance.
Here, we propose a novel method to achieve negative thermal expansion via a
metamaterial approach. The metamaterial is constructed with unit cells that
combine bi-material strips and anti-chiral structures. Both experimental and
simulation results display isotropic negative thermal expansion properties. The
coefficient of negative thermal expansion of the metamaterials is demonstrated
to be dependent on the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of
two component materials in the bi-material strips, as well as on the circular
node radius and the ligament length in the anti-chiral structures. The measured
value of the linear negative thermal expansion coefficient reaches -68.1X10-6
1/K in an operating temperature range from 303.15 K to 773.15 K, which is among
the largest achieved in experiments to date. Our findings provide a novel and
practical approach to obtaining materials with tunable isotropic negative
thermal expansion on any scale.

  contact: Experimental Measurements and Theoretical Analyses",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Triboluminescence (TL) is the emission of light produced by rubbing or
striking two materials together. Here, the light emission has been observed
from the sliding contact between two disks under dry condition. The effects of
the sliding speed on the intensity of TL have been experimentally investigated.
The results show that the intensity of the emission light increases
significantly with the sliding speed. A theoretical model is also proposed and
an analytical expression is deduced for the intensity of TL in the slide
contact. The theoretical prediction is found consistent with the experimental
results. The present work may be helpful to the understanding of the mechanism
of light emission when friction.

temporal dynamics of OCT scattering signals, has found a range of potential
applications in clinical and scientific research. Based on the model of random
phasor sums, temporal statistics of the complex-valued OCT signals are
mathematically described. Statistical distributions of the amplitude
differential and complex differential Angio-OCT signals are derived. The
theories are validated through the flow phantom and live animal experiments.
Using the model developed, the origin of the motion contrast in Angio-OCT is
mathematically explained, and the implications in the improvement of motion
contrast are further discussed, including threshold determination and its
residual classification error, averaging method, and scanning protocol. The
proposed mathematical model of Angio-OCT signals can aid in the optimal design
of the system and associated algorithms.

wind turbulence. However, the anisotropy of Els\""asser variables
($\textbf{Z}^\pm$) in 2D wave-vector space has yet to be investigated. Here we
first verify the transformation based on the projection-slice theorem between
the power spectral density PSD$_{2D}(k_\parallel,k_\perp )$ and the spatial
correlation function CF$_{2D} (r_\parallel,r_\perp )$. Based on the application
of the transformation to the magnetic field and the particle measurements from
the WIND spacecraft, we investigate the spectral anisotropy of Els\""asser
variables ($\textbf{Z}^\pm$), and the distribution of residual energy E$_{R}$,
Alfv\'en ratio R$_{A}$ and Els\""asser ratio R$_{E}$ in the
$(k_\parallel,k_\perp)$ space. The spectra PSD$_{2D}(k_\parallel,k_\perp )$ of
$\textbf{B}$, $\textbf{V}$, and $\textbf{Z}_{major}$ (the larger of
$\textbf{Z}^\pm$) show a similar pattern that PSD$_{2D}(k_\parallel,k_\perp )$
is mainly distributed along a ridge inclined toward the $k_\perp$ axis. This is
probably the signature of the oblique Alfv\'enic fluctuations propagating
outwardly. Unlike those of $\textbf{B}$, $\textbf{V}$, and
$\textbf{Z}_{major}$, the spectrum PSD$_{2D}(k_\parallel,k_\perp )$ of
$\textbf{Z}_{minor}$ is distributed mainly along the $k_\perp$ axis. Close to
the $k_\perp$ axis, $\left| {E}_{R}\right|$ becomes larger while R$_{A}$
becomes smaller, suggesting that the dominance of magnetic energy over kinetic
energy becomes more significant at small $k_\parallel$. R$_{E}$ is larger at
small $k_\parallel$, implying that PSD$_{2D}(k_\parallel,k_\perp )$ of
$\textbf{Z}_{minor}$ is more concentrated along the $k_\perp$ direction as
compared to that of $\textbf{Z}_{major}$. The residual energy condensate at
small $k_\parallel$ is consistent with simulation results in which E$_{R}$ is
spontaneously generated by Alfv\'en wave interaction.
