directly adds holes to the t2g bands, reduces the SOC and thus rebalances the

reorganize this description into collinear splittings, high-momentum-transfer
scatterings, drag and diffusion, and particle conversions (momentum-preserving

valid to NLO in $g$, and compute the appropriate modifications of the drag,
diffusion, particle conversion, and inelastic splitting coefficients. In
addition, a new kinematic regime opens at NLO for wider-angle collinear
bremsstrahlung. These semi-collinear emissions smoothly interpolate between the

reduce their ability to transmit dengue virus. Although the bacterium is
transmitted vertically from infected mothers to their offspring, it can be
difficult to establish an endemic infection in a wild mosquito population. We
developed and analyzed an ordinary differential equation model to investigate
the transmission dynamics of releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to
establish an endemic infection in a population of wild uninfected mosquitoes.
Our transmission model for the adult and aquatic-stage mosquitoes takes into
account Wolbachia-induced fitness change and cytoplasmic incompatibility. We
showed that, for a wide range of realistic parameter values, the basic
reproduction number is less than one. Hence, the epidemic will die out if only
a few Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are introduced into the wild population.
Even though the basic reproduction number is less than one, an endemic
Wolbachia infection can be established if a sufficient number of infected
mosquitoes are released. This threshold effect is created by a backward
bifurcation with three coexisting equilibria: a stable zero-infection
equilibrium, an intermediate-infection unstable endemic equilibrium, and a
high-infection stable endemic equilibrium. We analyzed the impact of reducing
the wild mosquito population before introducing the infected mosquitoes and
observed that the most effective approach to establish the infection in the
wild is based on reducing mosquitoes in both the adult and aquatic stages.

retain the same relativistic quantization as the pure Dirac case. The height of
the universal interband background conductivity is unaltered, but its onset is
changed. However, the non-relativistic term leads directly to particle-hole

reduce the degree of divergence of Feynman diagrams with boson legs.

convergent for a dynamical critical exponent $z<3$, and divergent beyond

  Fractions from Aging Sprague Dawley Rats","16 pages, 1 table, 2 figures",,,,"q-bio.SC q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ketamine is widely used in veterinary medicine and in medicine. Ketamine is
metabolized to its active metabolite norketamine principally by liver CYP3A.
Drug metabolism alterations during aging have severe consequences particularly
in anesthesiology and very few studies on older animals were conducted for
ketamine. The objective of the present study is to assess the influence of
aging on CYP3A metabolism of ketamine. Liver S9 fractions from 3, 6, 12 and 18
month old male Sprague Dawley rats were prepared and Michaelis-Menten
parameters were determined for primary metabolic pathways. The derived maximum
enzyme velocity (i.e. Vmax) suggests a rapid saturation of the CYP3A enzyme
active sites in liver S9 fractions of 18-month old rats. Observed Vmax for
Liver S9 fractions from 3, 6 and 12 month old male Sprague Dawley rats were
2.39 (+-0.23), 2.61 (+-0.18), and 2.07 (+-0.07) respectively compared to 0.68
(+-0.02) for Liver S9 fractions from 18 month old male Sprague Dawley rats.
Interestingly, we observed a 6 to 7 fold change in the derived Km when
comparing Liver S9 fractions from 18 month old male Sprague Dawley rats with
Liver S9 fractions from younger rats. Our results suggest that rat CYP3A enzyme
undergoes conformational changes with age particularly in our geriatric group
(e.g. 18 month rats) leading significant decrease in the rate of formation of
norketamine. Moreover, our results strongly suggest a severe impairment of
CYP3A ketamine mediated metabolism.

focus on the fusion of this interface with conformal boundary conditions. At

argued in [1] that changing the radius in the bulk induces a boundary RG flow.
Following [2] we conjecture that fusing the basic radius changing interface
(that changes the radius from a fraction of the self-dual radius) with the
exceptional boundary conditions gives the boundary condition which is the end
point of the RG flow considered in [1]. By studying the fusion singularities we
recover RG logarithms and see, in particular instances, how they get resummed
into power singularities. We discuss what quantities need to be calculated to
gain full non-perturbative control over the fusion.

modules to form a scalable machine. Typically it is assumed that the links
between modules are prone to noise while operations within modules have
significantly higher fidelity. To optimise fault tolerance in such
architectures we introduce a hierarchical generalisation of the surface code: a
small `patch' of the code exists within each module, and constitutes a single
effective qubit of the logic-level surface code. Errors primarily occur in a
two-dimensional subspace, i.e. patch perimeters extruded over time, and the
resulting noise threshold for inter-module links can exceed ~ 10% even in the
absence of purification. Increasing the number of qubits within each module
decreases the number of qubits necessary for encoding a logical qubit. But this
advantage is relatively modest, and broadly speaking a `fine grained' network
of small modules containing only ~ 8 qubits is competitive in total qubit count
versus a `course' network with modules containing many hundreds of qubits.

detection of biosignatures from Earth-like planets in their habitable zones
around G-stars. The discovery of a single instance of life elsewhere in the
universe would be a profound event for humanity. But not at any cost. At 8-9B
USD this High Definition Space Telescope (HDST) would take all the NASA
astrophysics budget for nearly 20 years, unless new funds are found. For a
generation NASA could build no ""Greater Observatories"" matching JWST in the
rest of the spectrum. This opportunity cost prompted me to study the driving
exobiosphere detection case for HDST. I find that: (1) the focus on G-stars is
not well justified; (2) only G-stars require the use of direct imaging; (3) in
the chosen 0.5 - 2.5 micron band, the available biosignatures are ambiguous and
a larger sample does not help; (4) the expected number of exobiospheres is 1,
with a 5% chance of zero; (5) the accessible sample size is too small to show
that exobiospheres are rare; (6) a sufficiently large sample would require a
much larger telescope; (7) the great progress in M-star planet spectroscopy -
both now and with new techniques, instruments and telescopes already planned -
means that a biosignature will likely be found before HDST could complete its
search in ~2045. For all these reasons I regretfully conclude that HDST, while
commendably ambitious, is not the right choice for NASA Astrophysics at this
time. The first exobiosphere discovery is likely to be such a major event that
scientific and public pressure will produce new funding across a range of
disciplines, not just astrophysics, to study the nature of Life in the
Universe. Then will be the time when a broader science community can advocate
for a mission that will make definitive exobiosphere measurements.

early age experimental characterization as well as the results of subsequent
simulations of a typical UHPC matrix. Performed and simulated tests include
unconfined compression, splitting (Brazilian), and three-point-bending tests.
The computational framework is formulated by coupling a hygro-thermo-chemical

functions. The HTC component allows taking into account various types of curing
conditions with varying temperature and relative humidity and predicting the
level of concrete aging. The mechanical component, the Lattice Discrete

concrete at the length scale of major heterogeneities. The aging functions
relate the mesoscale LDPM mechanical properties in terms of aging degree,

  Constraints using LP Hierarchies",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a classical problem in scheduling, one has $n$ unit size jobs with a
precedence order and the goal is to find a schedule of those jobs on $m$
identical machines as to minimize the makespan. It is one of the remaining four
open problems from the book of Garey & Johnson whether or not this problem is
$\mathbf{NP}$-hard for $m=3$.
  We prove that for any fixed $\varepsilon$ and $m$, an LP-hierarchy lift of
the time-indexed LP with a slightly super poly-logarithmic number of $r =
(\log(n))^{\Theta(\log \log n)}$ rounds provides a $(1 +
\varepsilon)$-approximation. For example Sherali-Adams suffices as hierarchy.
This implies an algorithm that yields a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation in time
$n^{O(r)}$. The previously best approximation algorithms guarantee a $2 -
\frac{7}{3m+1}$-approximation in polynomial time for $m \geq 4$ and
$\frac{4}{3}$ for $m=3$. Our algorithm is based on a recursive scheduling
approach where in each step we reduce the correlation in form of long chains.
Our method adds to the rather short list of examples where hierarchies are
actually useful to obtain better approximation algorithms.

driving mechanism of this is that the particles try to maximize the available
free area on the confining surface, which can be achieved by minimizing the
cross section areas of the particles with the plane. In the lack out-of-plane
orientational freedom the monolayer of prolate particles is identical to a
two-dimensional hard ellipse system, which undergoes an isotropic-nematic

by performing each operation on a small number of servers. Because transactions
on multiple keys necessarily require coordination across multiple servers,
NoSQL systems often explicitly avoid making transactional guarantees in order

coordination by either increasing the granularity at which transactions are

  This paper presents a novel protocol for providing serializable transactions

allows multiple transactions to prepare and commit simultaneously, improving
concurrency in the system, while ensuring that no cycles form between
concurrently-committing transactions. We have fully implemented acyclic

achieves 4 times higher throughput than Sinfonia's mini-transactions on the

deviations from $\Lambda$CDM+GR within the context of Horndeski gravity, which
is the most general theory of gravity with second derivatives in the equations

functions of time $\alpha_i(t)$ are proportional to the cosmological density of
dark energy $\Omega_{DE}(t)$. Constraints on this extended parameter space
using a suite of state-of-the art cosmological observations are presented for
the first time. Although the theory is able to accommodate the low multipoles
of the Cosmic Microwave Background and the low amplitude of fluctuations from
redshift space distortions, we find no significant tension with $\Lambda$CDM+GR
when performing a global fit to recent cosmological data and thus there is no
evidence against $\Lambda$CDM+GR from an analysis of the value of the Bayesian
evidence ratio of the modified gravity models with respect to $\Lambda$CDM,
despite introducing extra parameters. The posterior distribution of these extra
parameters that we derive return strong constraints on any possible deviations
from $\Lambda$CDM+GR in the context of Horndeski gravity. We illustrate how our
results can be applied to a more general frameworks of modified gravity models.

effects tend to work against the black hole hair formation. This, in turn, has
an adverse effect on the holographic superconductor by making the
superconducting phase more fragile. This is reflected in the reduced value of
the critical magnetic field and critical temperature. Finally, we comment on a
qualitative agreement between our (holographic superconductor) result and that
obtained for a conventional superconductor in NC space in a purely condensed

the positive-parity deformed configurations of the one-neutron halo nucleus
$^{11}$Be, we assess different mechanisms that stabilize collective behavior
beyond the limits of particle stability.
  ${\textbf{Method:}}$ To solve a particle-plus-core problem, we employ a
non-adiabatic coupled-channel formalism and the Berggren single-particle
ensemble, which explicitly contains bound states, narrow resonances, and the
scattering continuum. We study the valence-neutron density in the intrinsic
rotor frame to assess the validity of the adiabatic approach as the excitation
energy increases.
  ${\textbf{Results:}}$ We demonstrate that collective rotation of the ground
band of $^{11}$Be is stabilized by (i) the fact that the $\ell=0$ one-neutron
decay channel is closed, and (ii) the angular momentum alignment, which
increases the parentage of high-$\ell$ components at high spins; both effects
act in concert to decrease decay widths of ground-state band members. This is
not the case for higher-lying states of $^{11}$Be, where the $\ell=0$
neutron-decay channel is open and often dominates.

to train a large semantic concept bank a priori. Given a text description of an
event, event retrieval is performed by selecting concepts linguistically
related to the event description and fusing the concept responses on unseen

requires vast computational resources. Therefore, recent approaches automate
concept discovery and training by leveraging large amounts of weakly annotated

use of concept pairs or, more generally, n-grams. However, not all visually
salient n-grams are necessarily useful for an event query--some combinations of
concepts may be visually compact but irrelevant--and this drastically affects
performance. We propose an event retrieval algorithm that constructs pairs of
automatically discovered concepts and then prunes those concepts that are
unlikely to be helpful for retrieval. Pruning depends both on the query and on
the specific video instance being evaluated. Our approach also addresses

method by recovering the usual 2PI effective action due to Cornwall, Jackiw and
Tomboulis, differing only by the fact that the saddle-point evaluation of the
path integral is performed along the extremal quantum, rather than classical,
path. As such, this approach is of particular relevance to situations where the
dominant quantum and classical paths are non-perturbatively far away from
one-another. A pertinent example is the decay of false vacua in
radiatively-generated potentials, as may occur for the electroweak vacuum of
the Standard Model. In addition, we describe how the external sources may
instead be chosen so as to yield the two-particle-point-irreducible (2PPI)
effective action of Coppens and Verschelde. Finally, in the spirit of the
symmetry-improved effective action of Pilaftsis and Teresi, we give an example
of how the external sources can be used to preserve global symmetries in
truncations of the 2PI effective action. Specifically, in the context of an

the NeVIII doublet show a ~4 sigma variation over a timescale of 2.8 months in
the QSO's rest-frame. Both members of the NeVIII doublet exhibit non-black
saturation, indicating partial coverage of the continuum source. An increase in
the NeVIII covering fraction from f_c = 0.59\pm0.05 to 0.72\pm0.03 is observed
over the same period. The NeVIII profiles are too highly saturated to be
susceptible to changes in the ionization state of the absorbing gas. In fact,
we do not observe any significant variation in the EW and/or column density
after correcting the spectra for partial coverage. We, thus, propose transverse
motions of the absorbing gas being the cause of the observed variability. Using
a simple model of a transiting cloud we estimate a transverse speed of ~1800
km/s. For Keplerian motion, this corresponds to a distance between the absorber
and the central engine of ~1.3 pc, which places the absorber just outside the
BLR region. We further estimate a density of ~5\times10^6 cm^(-3) and a kinetic
luminosity of ~10^43 - 10^44 erg/s. Such large kinetic powers suggest that
outflows detected via EUV lines are potentially major contributors to AGN

geodesics do not stop there. Moreover, since there is no central singularity
the space-time turns out to be geodesically complete. Another unpleasant
feature of spacetimes with NUTs is the presence of regions where the azimuthal

we demonstrate the existence of timelike and null geodesics connecting two

an $n \times n$ symmetric data matrix $A$, where for distinct indices $i,j$,
$A_{ij} \sim P$ if $i, j$ both belong to the community and $A_{ij} \sim Q$
otherwise, for two known probability distributions $P$ and $Q$ depending on
$n$. If $P={\rm Bern}(p)$ and $Q={\rm Bern}(q)$ with $p>q$, it reduces to the
problem of finding a densely-connected $K$-subgraph planted in a large
Erd\""os-R\'enyi graph; if $P=\mathcal{N}(\mu,1)$ and $Q=\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ with
$\mu>0$, it corresponds to the problem of locating a $K \times K$ principal
submatrix of elevated means in a large Gaussian random matrix. We focus on two
types of asymptotic recovery guarantees as $n \to \infty$: (1) weak recovery:
expected number of classification errors is $o(K)$; (2) exact recovery:
probability of classifying all indices correctly converges to one. Under mild
assumptions on $P$ and $Q$, and allowing the community size to scale
sublinearly with $n$, we derive a set of sufficient conditions and a set of
necessary conditions for recovery, which are asymptotically tight with sharp
constants. The results hold in particular for the Gaussian case, and for the
case of bounded log likelihood ratio, including the Bernoulli case whenever
$\frac{p}{q}$ and $\frac{1-p}{1-q}$ are bounded away from zero and infinity. An
important algorithmic implication is that, whenever exact recovery is
information theoretically possible, any algorithm that provides weak recovery
when the community size is concentrated near $K$ can be upgraded to achieve
exact recovery in linear additional time by a simple voting procedure.

augment this robust ISS controller with a model-free learning algorithm to
estimate the model uncertainties. We implement this method with two different

(and likely only) information will come from the spectroscopic characterization
of the planet's atmosphere. Of the countless number of chemical species
terrestrial life produces, only a few have the distinct spectral features and
the necessary atmospheric abundance to be detectable. The easiest of these
species to observe in Earth's atmosphere is O$_{2}$ (and its photochemical
byproduct, O$_{3}$). But O$_{2}$ can also be produced abiotically by photolysis
of CO$_{2}$, followed by recombination of O atoms with each other. CO is
produced in stoichiometric proportions. Whether O$_{2}$ and CO can accumulate
to appreciable concentrations depends on the ratio of far-UV to near-UV
radiation coming from the planet's parent star and on what happens to these
gases when they dissolve in a planet's oceans. Using a one-dimensional
photochemical model, we demonstrate that O$_{2}$ derived from CO$_{2}$
photolysis should not accumulate to measurable concentrations on planets around
F- and G-type stars. K-star, and especially M-star planets, however, may build
up O$_{2}$ because of the low near-UV flux from their parent stars, in
agreement with some previous studies. On such planets, a 'false positive' for
life is possible if recombination of dissolved CO and O$_{2}$ in the oceans is
slow and if other O$_{2}$ sinks (e.g., reduced volcanic gases or dissolved
ferrous iron) are small. O$_{3}$, on the other hand, could be detectable at UV
wavelengths ($\lambda$ < 300 nm) for a much broader range of boundary

(HST) imaging study of ~100 Swift long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs)
spanning 0.03 < z < 9.4 using relative astrometry from afterglow observations
to locate the bursts within their host galaxies. We measure the distribution of
LGRB offsets from their host centers, as well as their relation to the
underlying host light distribution. We find that the host-normalized offsets
(R/R_h) of LGRBs are more centrally concentrated than expected for an
exponential disk profile, with a median of 0.67, and in particular they are
more concentrated than the underlying surface brightness profiles of their host
galaxies. The distribution of offsets is inconsistent with the distribution for
Type II supernovae (SNe) but consistent with the distribution for Type Ib/c
SNe. The fractional flux distribution, with a median of 0.75, indicates that
LGRBs prefer some of the brightest locations in their host galaxies but are not
as strongly correlated as previous studies indicated. More importantly, we find
a clear correlation between the offset and fractional flux, where bursts at
R/R_h < 0.5 exclusively occur at fractional fluxes > 0.6 while bursts at R/R_h
> 0.5 uniformly trace the light of their hosts. This indicates that the spatial
correlation of LGRB locations with bright star forming regions seen in the full
sample is dominated by the contribution from bursts at small offset and that
LGRBs in the outer parts of galaxies show no preference for unusually bright
star forming regions. We conclude that LGRBs strongly prefer the bright, inner
regions of their hosts indicating that the star formation taking place there is
more favorable for LGRB progenitor production. This indicates that another
environmental factor beyond metallicity, such as binary interactions or IMF
differences, may be operating in the central regions of LGRB hosts.

sky-averaged (global) 21-cm signal to properties of the intergalactic medium,
we now investigate the prospects for constraining a simple galaxy formation
model with current and near-future experiments. Markov-Chain Monte Carlo fits
to our synthetic dataset, which includes a realistic galactic foreground, a
plausible model for the signal, and noise consistent with 100 hours of
integration by an ideal instrument, suggest that a simple four-parameter model
that links the production rate of Lyman-$\alpha$, Lyman-continuum, and X-ray
photons to the growth rate of dark matter halos can be well-constrained (to
$\sim 0.1$ dex in each dimension) so long as all three spectral features
expected to occur between $40 \lesssim \nu / \mathrm{MHz} \lesssim 120$ are
detected. Several important conclusions follow naturally from this basic
numerical result, namely that measurements of the global 21-cm signal can in
principle (i) identify the characteristic halo mass threshold for star
formation at all redshifts $z \gtrsim 15$, (ii) extend $z \lesssim 4$ upper
limits on the normalization of the X-ray luminosity star-formation rate
($L_X$-SFR) relation out to $z \sim 20$, and (iii) provide joint constraints on
stellar spectra and the escape fraction of ionizing radiation at $z \sim 12$.
Though our approach is general, the importance of a broad-band measurement
renders our findings most relevant to the proposed Dark Ages Radio Explorer,
which will have a clean view of the global 21-cm signal from $\sim 40-120$ MHz
from its vantage point above the radio-quiet, ionosphere-free lunar far-side.

systematically steeper. This trend is present for all halo masses and
originates mostly from red satellites. This ubiquitous faint-end upturn
suggests that it is formation, rather than halo-specific environmental effect,
that plays a major role in regulating the stellar masses of faint satellites.
We show that the satellite luminosity functions can be described in a simple
manner by a double Schechter function with amplitudes scaling with halo mass
over the entire range of observables. Combining these conditional luminosity
functions with the dark matter halo mass function, we accurately recover the
entire field luminosity function over 10 visual magnitudes and reveal that
satellite galaxies dominate the field luminosity function at magnitudes fainter
than $-17$. We find that the luminosity functions of blue and red satellite
galaxies show distinct shapes and we present estimates of the stellar mass
fraction as a function of halo mass and galaxy type. Finally, using a simple

Chandrasekhar's formalism. The key novelty is the introduction of physically
motivated, radially varying, maximum and minimum impact parameters. With these,
our model gives an excellent match to full N-body simulations for isotropic
background density distributions, both cuspy and shallow, without any
fine-tuning of the model parameters. In particular, we are able to reproduce
the dramatic core-stalling effect that occurs in shallow/constant density
cores, for the first time. This gives us new physical insight into the
core-stalling phenomenon. We show that core stalling occurs in the limit in
which the product of the Coulomb logarithm and the local fraction of stars with
velocity lower than the infalling body tends to zero. For cuspy backgrounds,
this occurs when the infalling mass approaches the enclosed background mass.
For cored backgrounds, it occurs at larger distances from the centre, due to a
combination of a rapidly increasing minimum impact parameter and a lack of slow
moving stars in the core. This demonstrates that the physics of core-stalling
is likely the same for both massive infalling objects and low-mass objects
moving in shallow density backgrounds. We implement our prescription for
dynamical friction in the direct summation code NBODY6 as an analytic
correction for stars that remain within the Roche volume of the infalling
object. This approach is computationally efficient, since only stars in the
inspiralling system need to be evolved with direct summation. Our method can be
applied to study a variety of astrophysical systems, including young star
clusters orbiting near the Galactic Centre; globular clusters moving within the
Galaxy; and dwarf galaxies orbiting within dark matter halos.

simulated baryon fields, we investigate how approximations found in the

parameters work surprisingly well in the limit of no thermal broadening and
linear redshift-space distortions. We also show that his $b_\eta$ formula is
exact in the limit of no thermal broadening. Since introduction of thermal
broadening significantly affects its value, we speculate that a combination of
large-scale measurements of $b_\eta$ and the small scale flux PDF might be a
sensitive probe of the thermal state of the IGM. We find that large-scale

zero magnetic field-divergence (div-B). Constrained transport (CT) schemes can
achieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very
specific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,
'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still
be significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic
deviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we
propose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a
hybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a
reconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,
globally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike
'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically
unstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We
implement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test
problems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces
the maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex
below the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large
div-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic
errors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable
to CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG
correction can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD
methods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are
sufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using
only the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,
order-of-magnitude errors.

SDSS g'- and r'-band surface brightness, (g'- r') color, and ionized-gas oxygen
abundance profiles for 324 galaxies within the CALIFA survey are used for this
purpose. We perform a detailed light-profile classification finding that 84% of
our disks show down- or up-bending profiles (Type II and Type III,
respectively) while the remaining 16% are well fitted by one single exponential
(Type I). The analysis of the color gradients at both sides of this break shows
a U-shaped profile for most Type II galaxies with an average minimum (g'- r')
color of ~0.5 mag and a ionized-gas metallicity flattening associated to it
only in the case of low-mass galaxies. More massive systems show a rather
uniform negative metallicity gradient. The correlation between metallicity
flattening and stellar mass results in p-values as low as 0.01. Independently
of the mechanism having shaped the outer light profiles of these galaxies,
stellar migration or a previous episode of star formation in a shrinking
star-forming disk, it is clear that the imprint in their ionized-gas
metallicity was different for low- and high-mass Type II galaxies. In the case
of Type III disks, a positive correlation between the change in color and
abundance gradient is found (the null hypothesis is ruled out with a p-value of
0.02), with the outer disks of Type III galaxies with masses $\leq$10$^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$ showing a weak color reddening or even a bluing. This is
interpreted as primarily due to a mass down-sizing effect on the population of
Type III galaxies having recently experienced an enhanced inside-out growth.

the relation between the average dimensionless velocity (i.e. the Capillary
number) and the dimensionless volume forces (i.e. the Bond number). To this
aim, it is needed to define operative strategies to compute the Capillary
number for the shear thinning fluids and compare with the corresponding
newtonian case. Results from experiments were complemented with lattice
Boltzmann numerical simulations of sliding droplets, aimed to disentangle the
influence that non-newtonian flow properties have on the sliding.

spatial scales in the solar corona. In the open magnetic field of coronal
holes, jets form quasi-radial spires that can extend far out into the
heliosphere, while in closed-field regions the jet outflows are confined to the
corona. We explore the application of the embedded-bipole model to jets
occurring in closed coronal loops. In this model, magnetic free energy is
injected slowly by footpoint motions that introduce twist within the closed
dome of the jet source region, and is released rapidly by the onset of an ideal
kink-like instability. Two length scales characterize the system: the width (N)
of the jet source region and the footpoint separation (L) of the coronal loop
that envelops the jet source. We find that the jet characteristics are highly
sensitive to the ratio L/N, in both the conditions for initiation and the
subsequent dynamics. The longest-lasting and most energetic jets occur along
long coronal loops with large L/N ratios, and share many features of open-field
jets, while smaller L/N ratios produce shorter-duration, less energetic jets
that are affected by reflections from the far-loop footpoint. We quantify the
transition between these behaviours and show that our model replicates key
qualitative and quantitative aspects of both quiet-Sun and active-region loop
jets. We also find that the reconnection between the closed dome and
surrounding coronal loop is very extensive: the cumulative reconnected flux at
least matches the total flux beneath the dome for small L/N, and is more than
double that value for large L/N.

room-temperature solid-state maser is based on a pentacene-doped p-terphenyl
crystal, which has long spin lifetime (~0.1 ms). This maser, however, operates
only in the pulse mode and the material is unstable. Here we propose
room-temperature maser based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond, which
feature long spin lifetimes at room temperature (~10 ms), high optical pump
efficiency, and material stability. We demonstrate that under readily
accessible conditions, room-temperature diamond maser is feasible.
Room-temperature diamond maser may facilitate a broad range of microwave

density fluctuations that vary with height, and apparently travel upward from
the chromosphere into the prominence material with quasi-periodic fluctuations

km. Recent Doppler shift observations show the transverse displacement of the
propagating waves. The magnetic field was measured with THEMIS instrument and
was found to be 5-14 G. For the typical prominence density the corresponding
fast magnetosonic speed is $\sim$20 km s$^{-1}$, in qualitative agreement with
the propagation speed of the detected waves. The 2.5D MHD numerical model is

Bayesians have struggled to provide guidance on specification of priors. We use
the frequentist statistical decision theory of Wald (1950) to study design of

consider trials that draw predetermined numbers of subjects at random within

in a regime where the laser pulse length is on the order of or longer than the
wake wavelength and where ionization injection is employed to inject electrons
into the wake. In these experiments, the trapped electrons will co-propagate
with the longitudinal wakefield and the transverse laser field. In this
scenario, the electrons can gain a significant amount of energy from both the
direct laser acceleration (DLA) mechanism as well as the usual LWFA mechanism.
Particle-in-cell (PIC) codes are frequently used to discern the relative
contribution of these two mechanisms. However, if the longitudinal resolution
used in the PIC simulations is inadequate, it can produce numerical heating
that can overestimate the transverse motion, which is important in determining
the energy gain due to DLA. We have therefore carried out a systematic study of
this LWFA regime by varying the longitudinal resolution of PIC simulations from
the standard, best-practice resolution of 30 points per laser wavelength to
four times that value and then examining the energy gain characteristics of
both the highest-energy electrons and the bulk electrons. By calculating the
contribution of DLA to the final energies of the electrons produced from the
LWFA, we find that although the transverse momentum and oscillation radii are
over-estimated in the lower-resolution simulations, this over-estimation does
not lead to artificial energy gain by DLA. Rather, the DLA contribution to the
highest-energy electrons is larger in the higher-resolution cases because the
DLA resonance is better maintained. Thus, even at the highest longitudinal
resolutions, DLA contributes a significant portion of the energy gained by the
highest-energy electrons and also contributes to accelerating the bulk of the
charge in the electron beam produced by the LWFA.

of the raw analog-to-digital converter (ADC) data that must be transferred from
a spatially-separated antenna array to the baseband processing unit. The
theoretical limits as well as practical transceiver algorithms for such
quantized MU-MIMO systems operating over frequency-flat, narrowband channels
have been studied extensively. However, the practically relevant scenario where
such communication systems operate over frequency-selective, wideband channels
is less well understood. This paper investigates the uplink performance of a
quantized massive MU-MIMO system that deploys orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) for wideband communication. We propose new algorithms for
quantized maximum a-posteriori (MAP) channel estimation and data detection, and
we study the associated performance/quantization trade-offs. Our results
demonstrate that coarse quantization (e.g., four to six bits, depending on the
ratio between the number of BS antennas and the number of users) in massive
MU-MIMO-OFDM systems entails virtually no performance loss compared to the
infinite-precision case at no additional cost in terms of baseband processing
complexity.

inspired by the theory of geodesics in a Finsler spaces. The evolution of a
dynamical system is geometrized by introducing a non-linear connection, which
allows the construction of the KCC covariant derivative, and of the deviation
curvature tensor. In the KCC theory the properties of any dynamical system are
described in terms of five geometrical invariants, with the second one giving
the Jacobi stability of the system. Usually, the KCC theory is formulated by
reducing the dynamical evolution equations to a set of second order
differential equations. In the present paper we introduce and develop the KCC
approach for dynamical systems described by systems of arbitrary

sources using bandlimited measurements, which may be corrupted with noise. This
signal processing problem arises in numerous imaging problems, ranging from
astronomy to biology to spectroscopy, where it is common to take (coarse)
Fourier measurements of an object. Of particular interest is in obtaining
estimation procedures which are robust to noise, with the following desirable
statistical and computational properties: we seek to use coarse Fourier
measurements (bounded by some cutoff frequency); we hope to take a
(quantifiably) small number of measurements; we desire our algorithm to run
quickly.
  Suppose we have k point sources in d dimensions, where the points are
separated by at least \Delta from each other (in Euclidean distance). This work
provides an algorithm with the following favorable guarantees: - The algorithm
uses Fourier measurements, whose frequencies are bounded by O(1/\Delta) (up to
log factors). Previous algorithms require a cutoff frequency which may be as
large as {\Omega}( d/\Delta). - The number of measurements taken by and the
computational complexity of our algorithm are bounded by a polynomial in both
the number of points k and the dimension d, with no dependence on the
separation \Delta. In contrast, previous algorithms depended inverse
polynomially on the minimal separation and exponentially on the dimension for
both of these quantities.

measurements (as opposed to taking an exponential number of measurements on the
hyper-grid). Furthermore, our analysis and algorithm are elementary (based on
concentration bounds for sampling and the singular value decomposition).

population models are derived from Markov chains by exploiting symmetries
between individuals in the population and analyzing the limit as the population
size goes to infinity. In this paper, we study the theoretical foundations of
infinite population models of evolutionary algorithms on continuous
optimization problems. First, we show that the convergence proofs in a widely

modeling assumption of exchangeability of individuals cannot yield the
transition equation. Then, in order to analyze infinite population models, we
build an analytical framework based on convergence in distribution of random

framework is concise and mathematically rigorous. It also provides an
infrastructure for studying the convergence of the stacking of operators and of
iterating the algorithm which previous studies failed to address. Finally, we
use the framework to prove the convergence of infinite population models for
the mutation operator and the $k$-ary recombination operator. We show that
these operators can provide accurate predictions for real population dynamics

complex band structures of one-dimensional photonic crystals with PT symmetric
complex potentials by setting up a Hamiltonian using the Bloch states of the
photonic crystal without loss or gain as a basis. As a function of the degree
of non-Hermiticity, two types of PT symmetry transitions are found. One is that
a PT-broken phase can re-enter into a PT-exact phase at a higher degree of
non-Hermiticity. The other is that two spectral singularities, one originating
from the Brillouin zone center and the other from the Brillouin zone boundary,
can coalesce at some k-point in the interior of the Brillouin zone and create a
singularity of higher order. Furthermore, we can induce a band inversion by
tuning the filling ratio of the photonic crystal, and we find that the
geometric phases of the bands before and after the inversion are independent of
the amount of non-Hermiticity as long as the PT-exact phase is not broken. The
standard concept of topological transition can hence be extended to
non-Hermitian systems.

antenna can remarkably reduce the hardware cost and power consumption of a
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. However, such a pure
low-resolution ADC architecture also complicates parameter estimation problems
such as time/frequency synchronization and channel estimation. A mixed-ADC
architecture, where most of the antennas are equipped with low-precision ADCs
while a few antennas have full-precision ADCs, can solve these issues and
actualize the potential of the pure low-resolution ADC architecture. In this
paper, we present a unified framework to develop a family of detectors over the
massive MIMO uplink system with the mixed-ADC receiver architecture by
exploiting probabilistic Bayesian inference. As a basic setup, an optimal
detector is developed to provide a minimum mean-squared-error (MMSE) estimate
on data symbols. Considering the highly nonlinear steps involved in the
quantization process, we also investigate the potential for complexity
reduction on the optimal detector by postulating the common
\emph{pseudo-quantization noise} (PQN) model. In particular, we provide
asymptotic performance expressions including the MSE and bit error rate for the
optimal and suboptimal MIMO detectors. The asymptotic performance expressions
can be evaluated quickly and efficiently; thus, they are useful in system
design optimization. We show that in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
regime, the distortion caused by the PQN model can be ignored, whereas in the
high-SNR regime, such distortion may cause 1-bit detection performance loss.
The performance gap resulting from the PQN model can be narrowed by a small
fraction of high-precision ADCs in the mixed-ADC architecture.

this paper, the impact of customers' subjective behavior on each other's DSM
decisions is explicitly accounted for. In particular, a noncooperative game is
formulated between grid customers in which each customer can decide on whether
to participate in DSM or not. In this game, customers seek to minimize a cost
function that reflects their total payment for electricity. Unlike classical
game-theoretic DSM studies which assume that customers are rational in their
decision-making, a novel approach is proposed, based on the framework of
prospect theory (PT), to explicitly incorporate the impact of customer behavior
on DSM decisions. To solve the proposed game under both conventional game
theory and PT, a new algorithm based on fictitious player is proposed using
which the game will reach an epsilon-mixed Nash equilibrium. Simulation results
assess the impact of customer behavior on demand-side management. In
particular, the overall participation level and grid load can depend
significantly on the rationality level of the players and their risk aversion

discovered atomically thin semi-conductors. While it is understood that the
large binding energy is mainly due to the weak dielectric screening in two
dimensions (2D), a systematic investigation of the role of screening on 2D
excitons is still lacking. Here we provide a critical assessment of a widely
used 2D hydrogenic exciton model which assumes a dielectric function of the
form {\epsilon}(q) = 1 + 2{\pi}{\alpha}q, and we develop a quasi-2D model with
a much broader applicability. Within the quasi-2D picture, electrons and holes
are described as in-plane point charges with a finite extension in the
perpendicular direction and their interaction is screened by a dielectric
function with a non-linear q-dependence which is computed ab-initio. The
screened interaction is used in a generalized Mott-Wannier model to calculate
exciton binding energies in both isolated and supported 2D materials. For
isolated 2D materials, the quasi-2D treatment yields results almost identical
to those of the strict 2D model and both are in good agreement with ab-initio
many-body calculations. On the other hand, for more complex structures such as
supported layers or layers embedded in a van der Waals heterostructure, the
size of the exciton in reciprocal space extends well beyond the linear regime
of the dielectric function and a quasi-2D description has to replace the 2D
one. Our methodology has the merit of providing a seamless connection between
the strict 2D limit of isolated monolayer materials and the more bulk-like
screening characteristics of supported 2D materials or van der Waals
heterostructures.

It is well known that the sphere is the solution for $V=L^3/6\pi^2$, and this

that for $V<\alpha L^3/6\pi^2$, with $\alpha\approx 0.21$, such a surface

spherical caps, but rather a toroidal surface. Practically, a doughnut-shaped

its axisymmetry by breaking apart in smaller bubbles. Indisputably, however,
the topological transition from spherical to toroidal surfaces is mandatory
here for obtaining the global solution for this axisymmetric isoperimetric

Non-approximability renders heuristics attractive viable options, while
efficient methods with worst-case guarantee are a key concern in computational
complexity. This work proposes a novel near-Boolean optimization method relying
on a polynomial multilinear form with variables ranging each in a
high-dimensional unit simplex, rather than in the unit interval as usual. The
variables are the elements of the ground set, and distribute each a unit
membership over those feasible subsets where they are included. The given
problem is thus translated into a continuous version where the objective is to
maximize a function taking values on collections of points in a unit hypercube.
Maximizers are shown to always include collections of hypercube disjoint

solutions for the original discrete version of the problem. A gradient-based
local search in the expanded continuous domain is designed. Approximations with

of resource sharing for the peers during the normal as well as high degree of
overloading in the network. Thereafter we verified the accuracy of the transfer
function derived by comparing its output with the simulated P2P network. To
demonstrate how control system reduces free riding it has been shown through
simulations how the control systems penalizes the nodes indulging in different
levels of freeriding. Our proposed control system shows considerable gain over
existing state of art algorithm. This improvement is achieved through PI action
of controller. Since low reputation peers usually subvert reputation system by
whitewashing. We propose and substantiate a technique modifying transfer
function such that systems' sluggishness becomes adaptive in such a way that it
encourage genuine new comers to enter network and discourages member peers to
whitewash.

present the first theoretical model for the non-centrosomal MT cytoskeleton in
$Drosophila$ oocytes, in which $bicoid$ and $oskar$ mRNAs become localised to
establish the anterior-posterior body axis. Constrained by experimental
measurements, the model shows that a simple gradient of cortical MT nucleation
is sufficient to reproduce the observed MT distribution, cytoplasmic flow
patterns and localisation of $oskar$ and naive $bicoid$ mRNAs. Our simulations
exclude a major role for cytoplasmic flows in localisation and reveal an
organisation of the MT cytoskeleton that is more ordered than previously
thought. Furthermore, modulating cortical MT nucleation induces a bifurcation
in cytoskeletal organisation that accounts for the phenotypes of polarity
mutants. Thus, our three-dimensional model explains many features of the MT
network and highlights the importance of differential cortical MT nucleation
for axis formation.

100 MeV to 100 GeV. The dataset consists of the 774 blazars in the so-called
""Clean"" sample detected with a greater than approximately seven sigma detection
threshold and located above $\pm$20 deg Galactic latitude. We use
non-parametric methods verified in previous works to reconstruct the intrinsic
distributions from the observed ones which account for the data truncations
introduced by observational bias and includes the effects of the possible
correlation between the flux and photon index. The intrinsic flux distribution
can be represented by a broken power law with a high flux power-law index of
-2.43$\pm$0.08 and a low flux power-law index of -1.87$\pm$0.10. The intrinsic
photon index distribution can be represented by a Gaussian with mean of
2.62$\pm$0.05 and width of 0.17$\pm$0.02. We also report the intrinsic
distributions for the sub-populations of BL Lac and FSRQ type blazars
separately and these differ substantially. We then estimate the contribution of
FSRQs and BL Lacs to the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background radiation.
Under the simplistic assumption that the flux distributions probed in this
analysis continue to arbitrary low flux, we calculate that the best fit
contribution of FSRQs is 35% and BL Lacs 17% of the total gamma-ray output of
the Universe in this energy range.

and extracting information from them is an important research area. Early
algorithms on mining communities have focused on the global structure, and
often run in time functional to the size of the entire graph. Nowadays, as we
often explore networks with billions of vertices and find communities of size
hundreds, it is crucial to shift our attention from macroscopic structure to
microscopic structure in large networks. A growing body of work has been
adopting local expansion methods in order to identify the community members
from a few exemplary seed members.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for finding overlapping
communities called LEMON (Local Expansion via Minimum One Norm). The algorithm
finds the community by seeking a sparse vector in the span of the local spectra
such that the seeds are in its support. We show that LEMON can achieve the
highest detection accuracy among state-of-the-art proposals. The running time
depends on the size of the community rather than that of the entire graph. The
algorithm is easy to implement, and is highly parallelizable. We further
provide theoretical analysis on the local spectral properties, bounding the
measure of tightness of extracted community in terms of the eigenvalues of
graph Laplacian.
  Moreover, given that networks are not all similar in nature, a comprehensive
analysis on how the local expansion approach is suited for uncovering
communities in different networks is still lacking. We thoroughly evaluate our
approach using both synthetic and real-world datasets across different domains,
and analyze the empirical variations when applying our method to inherently
different networks in practice. In addition, the heuristics on how the seed set
quality and quantity would affect the performance are provided.

examining the fixed points of the system, next determining their stability as a

only one of them always emerges with probability close to one, because its
associated attractor dominates over the rest. This is shown through numerical
integrations and simulations,after analytic developments. In contrast to the

holes, white holes and wormholes due to their importance to the motion of
particles. There is a family of solution of the Brans-Dicke vacuum equations
that has not been fully studied from this perspective. In this paper, I study
some properties of this family and find the complete set of solutions that
avoids singularity at the point where the metric diverges or degenerates. The
possible changes in the metric signature when passing through this point is
analyzed. In addition, I also study the radial geodesics and obtain the
solutions of some particular cases.

areas which are based on nature and resources of quantum mechanics, as
superposition and entanglement. In its gate array version, the use of
convenient and appropriate gates is essential. But while those proposed gates
adopt convenient forms for computational algorithms, in the practice, their
design depends on specific quantum systems and stuff being used. Gates design
is restricted to properties and limitations of interactions and physical
elements being involved, where Quantum Control plays a deep role. Quantum
complexity of multipartite systems and their interactions requires a tight
control to manipulate their quantum states, either local and non-local ones,
but still a reducibility procedure should be addressed. This work shows how a
general $2d$-partite two level spin system in $SU(2d)$ could be decomposed in
$2^{n-1}$ subsystems on $SU(2)$, letting establish control operations. In
particular, it is shown that Bell gems basis is a set of natural states on
which decomposition happen naturally under some interaction restrictions. Thus,
alternating the direction of local interaction terms in the Hamiltonian, this
procedure states a universal exchange semantics on those basis. The structure
developed could be understood as a splitting of the $2d$ information channels
into $2^{2d-1}$ pairs of $2$ level information subsystems.

equation of motion of a complex fermion field in terms of a real scalar boson
in two dimensions. All the properties of the fermion field theory are known to
be preserved under this remarkable transformation with substantial
simplification and elucidation of the original theory, much like Lie groups can

  weighted residual collocation method","24 pages, 11 figures, submitted",,"10.1002/fld.4209",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fundamental interaction between tropical cyclones was investigated
through a series of water tank experiements by Fujiwhara [20, 21, 22]. However,
a complete understanding of tropical cyclones remains an open research
challenge although there have been numerous investigations through measurments
with aircrafts/satellites, as well as with numerical simulations. This article
presents a computational model for simulating the interaction between cyclones.
The proposed numerical method is presented briefly, where the time integration
is performed by projecting the discrete system onto a Krylov subspace. The
method filters the large scale fluid dynamics using a multiresolution
approximation, and the unresolved dynamics is modeled with a Smagorinsky type
subgrid scale parameterization scheme. Numerical experiments with Fujiwhara
interactions are considered to verify modeling accuracy. An excellent agreement
between the present simulation and a reference simulation at Re = 5000 has been
demonstrated. At Re = 37440, the kinetic energy of cyclones is seen
consolidated into larger scales with concurrent enstrophy cascade, suggesting a
steady increase of energy containing scales, a phenomena that is typical in
two-dimensional turbulence theory. The primary results of this article suggest
a novel avenue for addressing some of the computational challenges of mesoscale
atmospheric circulations.
