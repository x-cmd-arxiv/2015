spin plays a significant role during the adsorption process despite the general
weakness of the molecular-magnetic responses. The case of CO$_2$ adsorption in
Ni-MOF74 is particularly interesting, as the inclusion of spin effects results
in an increased attraction, opposite to what the diamagnetic nature of CO$_2$
would suggest. We explain this counter-intuitive result, tracking the behavior
to a coincidental hybridization of the O $p$ states with the Ni $d$ states in
the down-spin channel. More generally, by providing insight on nonlocal
correlation in concert with spin effects, our nonempirical svdW-DF method opens
the door for a deeper understanding of weak nonlocal magnetic interactions.

ordered magnetic field is characterized by a diffusion tensor whose components
depend on the particle's Larmor radius $R_L$ and the degree of order in the
magnetic field. Most studies of the particle diffusion presuppose a scale
separation between the mean and random magnetic fields (e.g., there being a
pronounced minimum in the magnetic power spectrum at intermediate scales).
Scale separation is often a good approximation in laboratory plasmas, but not
in most astrophysical environments such as the interstellar medium (ISM).
Modern simulations of the ISM have numerical resolution of order 1 pc, so the
Larmor radius of the cosmic rays that dominate in energy density is at least
$10^{6}$ times smaller than the resolved scales. Large-scale simulations of
cosmic ray propagation in the ISM thus rely on oversimplified forms of the
diffusion tensor. We take the first steps towards a more realistic description
of cosmic ray diffusion for such simulations, obtaining direct estimates of the
diffusion tensor from test particle simulations in random magnetic fields (with
the Larmor radius scale being fully resolved), for a range of particle energies
corresponding to $10^{-2}\lesssim R_L/l_c \lesssim 10^{3}$, where $l_c$ is the
magnetic correlation length. We obtain explicit expressions for the cosmic ray
diffusion tensor for $R_L/l_c \ll 1$, that might be used in a sub-grid model of
cosmic ray diffusion. The diffusion coefficients obtained are closely connected
with existing transport theories that include the random walk of magnetic
lines.

enhanced tunneling between electron states with collinear momenta in the
neighboring graphene layers. With the optimal selection of the barrier layer,
the surface plasmon gain due to the inelastic tunneling can compensate or even
exceed the loss due to both Drude and interband absorption. The tunneling

(strategy) is its ability to invade and take over an otherwise-monomorphic
population. Typically, one quantifies the success of a mutant strategy via the
probability that a randomly occurring mutant will fixate in the population.
However, in a structured population, this fixation probability may depend on
where the mutant arises. Moreover, the fixation probability is just one
quantity by which one can measure the success of a mutant; fixation time, for
instance, is another. We define a notion of homogeneity for evolutionary games
that captures what it means for two single-mutant states, i.e. two
configurations of a single mutant in an otherwise-monomorphic population, to be
""evolutionarily equivalent"" in the sense that all measures of evolutionary
success are the same for both configurations. Using asymmetric games, we argue
that the term ""homogeneous"" should apply to the evolutionary process as a whole
rather than to just the population structure. For evolutionary matrix games in
graph-structured populations, we give precise conditions under which the
resulting process is homogeneous. Finally, we show that asymmetric matrix games
can be reduced to symmetric games if the population structure possesses a

infer the relevant hardware bottlenecks and promising optimization
opportunities. Unfortunately, analytic performance modeling is often tedious
even for experienced developers since it requires in-depth knowledge about the
hardware and how it interacts with the software. We present the ""Kerncraft""
tool, which eases the construction of analytic performance models for streaming
kernels and stencil loop nests. Starting from the loop source code, the problem
size, and a description of the underlying hardware, Kerncraft can ideally
predict the single-core performance and scaling behavior of loops on multicore
processors using the Roofline or the Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) model. We
describe the operating principles of Kerncraft with its capabilities and
limitations, and we show how it may be used to quickly gain insights by
accelerated analytic modeling.

matrix, only $u$ of the entries of $y$ with $u < m$ are known. Thus $E_jw$,
called `measurements', are known for certain $j\in J \subset
\{0,1,\ldots,m-1\}$ where $\{E_i, i=0,1,\ldots, m-1\}$ are the rows of $A$ and
$|J|=u$. It is required, if possible, to solve the system uniquely when $x$ has
at most $t$ non-zero entries with $u\geq 2t$.
  Here such systems are considered from an error-correcting coding point of
view. The unknown $x$ can be shown to be the error vector of a code subject to
certain conditions on the rows of the matrix $A$. This reduces the problem to
finding a suitable decoding algorithm which then finds $x$.
  Decoding workable algorithms are shown to exist, from which the unknown $x$
may be determined, in cases where the known $2t$ values are evenly spaced (that
is, when the elements of $J$ are in arithmetic progression) for classes of
matrices satisfying certain row properties. These cases include Fourier
$n\times n $ matrices where the arithmetic difference $k$ satisfies
$\gcd(n,k)=1$, and classes of Vandermonde matrices $V(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$
(with $x_i\neq 0$) with arithmetic difference $k$ where the ratios $x_i/x_j$
for $i\neq j$ are not $k^{th}$ roots of unity. The decoding algorithm has
complexity $O(nt)$ and in some cases, including the Fourier matrix cases, the
complexity is $O(t^2)$.
  Matrices which have the property that the determinant of any square submatrix
is non-zero are of particular interest. Randomly choosing rows of such matrices
can then give $t$ error-correcting pairs to generate a `measuring' code
$C^\perp=\{E_j | j\in J\}$ with a decoding algorithm which finds $x$.
  This has applications to signal processing and compressed sensing.

to remain valid on large scales, we need to renormalize perturbations at higher
order. In the case of intensity mapping, the second-order contribution to

therefore the evolution bias. It also introduces a term that mimics white

the third or fourth kind scatterer and derive two geometric conditions,

analyze the limit of solutions when the approximate cloaking approaches the

that the limit of solutions are not measurable functions, making them outside

derives, for the very first time, its CA Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) in
closed-form expressions. By exploiting the full symmetry of square-QAM
constellations and further scrutinizing the Gray-coding mechanism, we express
the likelihood function (LF) of the system explicitly in terms of the code
bits' \textit{a priori} log-likelihood ratios (LLRs). The timing recovery task
is then embedded in the turbo iteration loop wherein increasingly accurate
estimates for such LLRs are computed from the output of the soft-input
soft-output (SISO) decoders and exploited at a per-turbo-iteration basis in
order to refine the ML time delay estimate. The latter is then used to better
re-synchronize the system, through feedback to the matched filter (MF), so as
to obtain more reliable symbol-rate samples for the next turbo iteration. In
order to properly benchmark the new CA ML estimator, we also derive for the
very first time the closed-form expressions for the exact CRLBs of the
underlying turbo synchronization problem. Computer simulations will show that
the new closed-form CRLBs coincide exactly with their empirical counterparts
evaluated previously using exhaustive Monte-Carlo simulations. They will also
show unambiguously the potential performance gains in time synchronization that
can be achieved owing to the decoder assistance. Moreover, the new CA ML
estimator almost reaches the underlying CA CRLBs, even for small SNRs, thereby
confirming its statistical efficiency in practice. It also enjoys significant
improvements in computational complexity as compared to the most powerful
existing ML solution, namely the combined sum-product and
expectation-maximization (SP-EM) algorithm.

Since physical quantities have to be gauge invariant, it is important to
establish an approach allowing the comparison of computations carried out in
different gauges even beyond perturbation theory. We show that the dependence
on the gauge parameter $\alpha=0$ in Yang-Mills theories is controlled by a
canonical flow that explicitly solves the Nielsen identities of the model.
Green's functions in the $\alpha=0$ gauge are given by amplitudes evaluated in
the theory at $\alpha=0$ (e.g., in the example of Lorentz-covariant gauges, in
terms of Landau gauge amplitudes) plus some contributions induced by the
$\alpha=0$-dependence of the generating functional of the canonical flow.
Explicit formulas are presented and an application of the formalism to the
gluon propagator is discussed.

examine the adherence/decay of the two bumps/dips in the condensate, which are

a fascinating phenomenon with the type-II lanes exhibiting two almost-parallel
sub-bands with similar morphology. The underlying split mechanism remains
elusive. One popular interpretation is that the splitting bands are emitted
from the shock upstream and downstream, respectively, with their frequency
ratio ({\gamma}) determined by the shock compression ratio. This interpretation
has been taken as the physical basis for many published references. Here we
report an observational analysis of type II events with nice split selected
from the ground-based RSTN data from 2001 to 2014, in the metric-decametric
wavelength. We investigate the temporal variation and distribution of {\gamma},
and conduct correlation analyses on the deduced spectral values. It is found
that {\gamma} varies in a very narrow range with >80% of {\gamma} (one-minute
averaged data) being between 1.15 to 1.25. For some well-observed and
long-lasting events, {\gamma} does not show a systematic variation trend within
observational uncertainties, from the onset to the termination of the splits.
In addition, the parameters representing the propagation speed of the radio
source (presumably the coronal shock) show a very weak or basically no
correlation with {\gamma}. We suggest that these results do not favor the
upstreamdownstream scenario of band splits.

analyses of general Hamiltonian models within the simplifications of mean-field
theory (MFT), as well as by computer simulations based on microscopic models,
are directed towards an appreciation of the role of the underlying
molecular-level interactions to facilitate its spontaneous condensation into a
nematic phase with biaxial symmetry. Continuing experimental challenges in
realising such a system unambiguously, despite encouraging predictions from MFT
for example, are requiring more versatile simulational methodologies capable of
providing insights into possible hindering barriers within the system,
typically gleaned through its free energy dependences on relevant observables
as the system is driven through the transitions. The recent brief report from
this group [B. Kamala Latha, et. al., Phys. Rev. E 89, 050501 (R), 2014]
summarizing the outcome of detailed Monte Carlo simulations carried out
employing entropic sampling technique, suggested a qualitative modification of
the MFT phase diagram as the Hamiltonian is asymptotically driven towards the
so-called partly-repulsive regions. It was argued that the degree of the
(cross) coupling between the uniaxial and biaxial tensor components of
neighbouring molecules plays a crucial role in facilitating, or otherwise, a
ready condensation of the biaxial phase, suggesting that this could be a
plausible f actor in explaining the experimental difficulties. In this paper,
we elaborate this point further, providing additional evidences from curious
variations of free-energy profiles with respect to the relevant orientational
order parameters, at different temperatures bracketing the phase transitions.

the metric corrections are valid at all (sub-horizon and super-horizon) scales
and converge at all points except at locations of the sources. The average

additions/subtractions, inner or outer vector products and permutations. In the
proposed approach, the $M$ input integer data streams are linearly superimposed
to form $M$ numerically entangled integer data streams that are stored in-place
of the original inputs. A series of LSB operations can then be performed
directly using these entangled data streams. The output results can be
extracted from any $M-1$ entangled output streams by additions and arithmetic
shifts, thereby guaranteeing robustness to a fail-stop failure in any single
stream computation. Importantly, unlike other methods, the number of operations
required for the entanglement, extraction and recovery of the results is
linearly related to the number of the inputs and does not depend on the
complexity of the performed LSB operations. We have validated our proposal in

Yoachim","Galactic archaeology of a thick disc: Excavating ESO 533-4 with VIMOS","Accepted for publication in A&A",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The formation mechanisms of thick discs are under discussion. Thick discs
might have formed either at high redshift on a short time-scale or might have
been built slowly over time. They may have an internal or an external origin.
Here we study in detail the kinematics and the stellar populations of the thick
disc of ESO533-4. ESO533-4 is a nearby bulgeless galaxy.
  We present the first ever IFU study of an edge-on galaxy with enough depth to
study the thick disc. We exposed ESO533-4 with VIMOS@VLT for 6.5hours. The FOV
covered an axial extent 0.1-0.7r_25 (1-7kpc). We used pPXF and the MILES
library to obtain velocity and stellar population maps. We compared our
kinematic data with simple GADGET-2 models.
  The apparent rotational lag of the thick disc of ESO533-4 is compatible with
that expected from the combinations of two effects: differential asymmetric
drift and the projection effects arising from studying a disc a few degrees
(2-3) away from edge-on. Thus, ESO533-4 contains little or no retrograde
material. This is compatible with three formation scenarii: the secular heating
of an initially thin disc, the formation of the thick disc at high redshift in
a turbulent disc phase, and its creation in a major merger event. If happening
in all galaxies, this last mechanism would cause retrograde thick discs in half
of them. Retrograde discs have not been observed in the five massive disc
galaxies (v_c>120km s^-1) for which thick disc kinematics are known. The
populations of the thin and the thick discs are separated in the
Age-log(Z/Z_Sun) plane. Thus, the thin and thick discs are made of two distinct
stellar populations. Although the stellar population results are not conclusive
due to the high dust extinction in ESO533-4, they do not favour a secular
evolution origin for the thick disc. Hence, we suggest that the thick disc of
ESO533-4 formed in a relatively short event (Abridged).

compact video representations based on scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)
vectors (extracted per frame) and local feature centers computed over a
training set. With the aim to increase robustness to visual distortions, we
propose a new approach that operates at a coarser level in the feature

clustering SIFT features to obtain local feature centers (LFCs) and then
encoding the latter with respect to given centers of local feature centers
(CLFCs), extracted from a training set. The sum-of-differences between the LFCs
and the CLFCs are aggregated to generate an extremely-compact video description
used for accurate video segment similarity detection. Experimentation using a

finite-length curves such that any line intersecting $U$ also intersects $B$.
In this paper, we consider the lower bound for the shortest barrier when $U$ is
the unit equilateral triangle. The known best lower bound for triangles is the
classic one by Jones [Jones,1964], which exhibits that the length of the
shortest barrier for any convex polygon is at least the half of its perimeter.
That is, for the unit equilateral triangle, it must be at least $3/2$. Very
recently, this lower bounds are improved for convex $k$-gons for any $k\geq 4$
[Kawamura et al. 2014], but the case of triangles still lack the bound better
than Jones' one. The main result of this paper is to fill this missing piece:
We give the lower bound of $3/2 + 5 \cdot 10^{-13}$ for the unit-size
equilateral triangle. The proof is based on two new ideas, angle-restricted
barriers and a weighted sum of projection-cover conditions, which may be of

hydrogen-terminated Si(111) surfaces, in which a two-dimensional electron
system (2DES) or a two-dimensional hole system (2DHS) can be populated in the
same conduction channel by changing the gate voltage of a global gate applied
through a vacuum gap. Depending on the gate bias, ion implanted n$^+$ and p$^+$
regions function either as Ohmic contacts or as in-plane gates, which laterally
confine the carriers induced by the global gate. On one device, electron and
hole densities of up to $7.8\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $7.6\times10^{11}$
cm$^{-2}$ respectively are obtained. The peak electron mobility is
$1.76\times10^5$ cm$^{2}$/Vs, and the peak hole mobility is $9.1\times10^3$
cm$^{2}$/Vs at 300 mK; the ratio of about 20 is mainly due to the very
different valley degeneracies (6:1) of electrons and holes on the Si(111)
surface. On another device, the peak electron mobility of $2.2\times10^5$
cm$^{2}$/Vs is reached at 300 mK. These devices are hexagonal in order to
investigate the underlying symmetry of the 2DESs, which have a sixfold valley
degeneracy at zero magnetic field. Three magnetoresistance measurements with
threefold rotational symmetry are used to determine the symmetry of the 2DESs
at different magnetic field. At filling factor $1 < \nu < 2$, the observed
anisotropy can be explained by a single valley pair occupancy of composite
fermions (CFs). Qualitatively the CFs preserve the valley anisotropy, in
addition to the twofold valley degeneracy. At magnetic field up to 35 T, the
2/3 fractional quantum Hall state is observed with a well developed hall
plateau; at $\nu<2/3$, the three magnetoresistances show a large anisotropy
(50:1). We also show that device degradation is not a serious issue for our
measurements, if the device is kept in vacuum or a nitrogen gas environment and
its time in air is minimized.

square lattice. Using a combination of classical Monte-Carlo simulation and
spin-wave theory, we uncover behaviour reminiscent of some widely-studied
frustrated antiferromagnets, but with a number of new twists. We first
demonstrate that, for a suitable choice of parameters, the phase diagram as a
function of magnetic field and temperature is nearly identical to that of the
Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice, including the celebrated
1/3-magnetisation plateau. We then examine how this phase diagram changes when
the model is tuned to a point where the classical ground--state is highly
degenerate. In this case, two new phases emerge; a classical,
finite-temperature spin-liquid, characterised by a ""ring"" in the spin
structure--factor $\mathcal{S}({\mathbf q})$; and a vortex crystal, a
multiple-Q state with finite magnetisation, which can be viewed as an ordered
lattice of magnetic vortices. All of these new phases persist for a wide range
of magnetic field. We discuss the relationship between these results and
published studies of frustrated antiferromagnets, together with some of the
materials where these new phases might be observed in experiment.

jeopardize statistical inference of the model of interest, if the missing
mechanism is nonignorable, that is, the missing mechanism depends on the
missing values themselves even conditional on the observed data. With a
nonignorable missing mechanism, the model of interest is often not identifiable
without imposing further assumptions. We find that even if the missing
mechanism has a known parametric form, the model is not identifiable without
specifying a parametric outcome distribution. Although it is fundamental for
valid statistical inference, identifiability under nonignorable missing
mechanisms is not established for many commonly-used models. In this paper, we
first demonstrate identifiability of the normal distribution under monotone
missing mechanisms. We then extend it to the normal mixture and $t$ mixture
models with non-monotone missing mechanisms. We discover that models under the
Logistic missing mechanism are less identifiable than those under the Probit
missing mechanism. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for
identifiability of models under the Logistic missing mechanism, which sometimes
can be checked in real data analysis. We illustrate our methods using a series
of simulations, and apply them to a real-life dataset.

exciton-to-biexciton transitions of a single semiconductor quantum dot in a
high-Q micropillar cavity, using photoluminescence spectroscopy. Resonant
two-photon excitation of the biexciton is achieved by spectrally tuning the
quantum dot emission with respect to the cavity mode. The cavity couples to
both transitions and amplifies the Rabi-frequency of the likewise resonant cw
laser, driving the transitions. We observe strong-field splitting of the
emission lines, which depend on the driving Rabi field amplitude and the
cavity-laser detuning. A dressed state theory of a driven 4-level atom
correctly predicts the distinct spectral transitions observed in the emission
spectrum, and a detailed description of the emission spectra is further
provided through a polaron master equation approach which accounts for cavity
coupling and acoustic phonon interactions of the semiconductor medium.

typically occurs for a sequence of Fano manifolds with anticanonical K\""ahler

admits a K\""ahler-Ricci limit soliton and the space of all $L^2$ holomorphic
vector fields with smooth potentials is a Lie algebra with respect to the Lie
bracket, then the Lie algebra has the same structure as smooth K\""ahler-Ricci

soliton and all holomorphic vector fields are $L^2$ with smooth potentials then
the Lie algebra has the same structure as smooth K\""ahler-Ricci solitons. If
the sequence consists of K\""ahler-Ricci solitons then the Ricci limit space is
a weak K\""ahler-Ricci soliton on a $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano variety and the space of

general form of the numerous equations with partial values of arbitrary spin,
which were considered in above mentioned preprint. The general forms of
quantum-mechanical and covariant equations for arbitrary spin together with the
general description of the arbitrary spin field formalism are presented. The
corresponding relativistic quantum mechanics of arbitrary spin is given as the
system of axioms. Previously ignored partial example of the spin s=(0,0)
particle-antiparticle doublet is considered. The partial example of spin
s=(3/2,3/2) particle-antiparticle doublet is highlighted. The new 64
dimensional Clifford--Dirac algebra over the field of real numbers is
suggested. The general operator, which transformed the relativistic canonical
quantum mechanics of arbitrary spin into the locally covariant field theory,
has been introduced. Moreover, the study of the place of the results given in
arXiv 1409.2766v2 [quant-ph] among the results of other authors is started. The
review of the different investigations in the area of relativistic canonical
quantum mechanics is given and the brief analysis of the existing approaches to
the covariant field theory of arbitrary spin is initiated. The consideration of
some important details of arXiv 1409.2766v2 [quant-ph] is improved.
