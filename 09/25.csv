of the MPA-JHU stellar masses have a significant impact on the massive end of
the stellar mass function, making the slope significantly shallower than that
estimated by Li \& White (2009), but steeper than derived by Bernardi et al.

molecular noise arising from the small number of molecules involved in gene
regulation. One of the strongest sources of stochasticity is the binary noise
that arises from the binding of a regulatory protein to a promoter in the
chromosomal DNA. In this study, we focus on two minimal oscillators based on
activator titration and repressor titration to understand the key parameters
that are important for oscillations and for overcoming binary noise. We show
that the rate of unbinding from the DNA, despite traditionally being considered
a fast parameter, needs to be slow to broaden the space of oscillatory
solutions. The addition of multiple, independent DNA binding sites further
expands the oscillatory parameter space for the repressor-titration oscillator
and lengthens the period of both oscillators. This effect is a combination of
increased effective delay of the unbinding kinetics due to multiple binding
sites and increased promoter ultrasensitivity that is specific for repression.
We then use stochastic simulation to show that multiple binding sites increase
the coherence of the oscillations by mitigating the binary noise. Slow values
of DNA unbinding rate are also effective in alleviating molecular noise due to
the increased distance from the bifurcation point. Our work demonstrates how
DNA binding sites and slow unbinding kinetics, which are often omitted in
biophysical models of gene circuits, can have a significant impact on the
temporal and stochastic dynamics of genetic oscillators.

5171A made a few decades ago. In that study no proper explanation could be
given for the enigmatic brightness excesses in the L band (VBLUW system,
lambda_eff=3838 A). In the present paper, we suggest that this might have been
caused by blue luminescence (BL), an emission feature of neutral polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs), discovered in 2004. It is a fact that
the highest emission peaks of the BL lie in the L band. Our goals were to
investigate other possible causes, and to derive the fluxes of the emission. We
used two-colour diagrams based on atmosphere models, spectral energy
distributions, and different extinctions and extinction laws, depending on the
location of the supposed BL source: either in Gum48d on the background or in
the envelope of HR 5171A. False L-excess sources, such as a hot companion, a
nearby star, or some instrumental effect, could be excluded. Also, emission
features from a hot chromosphere are not plausible. The fluxes of the L excess,
recorded in the data sets of 1971, 1973, and 1977 varied (all in units of
10^(-10) W m^(-2) micron^(-1)) between 1.4 to 21, depending on the location of
the source. A flux near the low side of this range is preferred. Small
brightness excesses in uv (uvby system) were present in 1979, but its
connection with BL is doubtful. For the L fluxes we consider the lowest values
as more realistic. The uncertainties are 20-30 %. Similar to other yellow
hypergiants, HR 5171A showed powerful brightness outbursts, particularly in the
1970s. A release of stored H-ionization energy by atmospheric instabilities
could create BL emitted by neutral PAHs.

resonances of metallic nanostructures amplify the absorption of excitation
light and assist in radiating the consequent fluorescence of nearby molecules
to the far-field. This effect is at the base of various technologies that have
strong impact on fields such as optics, medical diagnostics and biotechnology.
Among possible emission bands, those in the near-infrared (NIR) are
particularly intriguing and widely used in proteomics and genomics due to its
noninvasive character for biomolecules, living cells, and tissues, which
greatly motivates the development of effective, and eventually multifunctional
NIR-MEF platforms. Here we demonstrate NIR-MEF substrates based on Au nanocages
micropatterned with a tight spatial control. The dependence of the fluorescence
enhancement on the distance between the nanocage and the radiating dipoles is
investigated experimentally and modeled by taking into account the local
electric field enhancement and the modified radiation and absorption rates of
the emitting molecules. At a distance around 80 nm, a maximum enhancement up to
2-7 times with respect to the emission from pristine dyes (in the region 660
nm-740 nm) is estimated for films and electrospun nanofibers. Due to their
chemical stability, finely tunable plasmon resonances, and large light
absorption cross sections, Au nanocages are ideal NIR-MEF agents. When these
properties are integrated with the hollow interior and controllable surface
porosity, it is feasible to develop a nanoscale system for targeted drug
delivery with the diagnostic information encoded in the fluorophore.

important subjects in the frontier studies of modern condensed matter physics.
A topological insulator exhibits a unique pair of surface conduction bands with
the Dirac dispersion albeit the bulk insulating behaviour. These surface states
are protected by the topological order, and thus the spin and momentum of these
surface electrons are locked together demonstrating the feature of time
reversal invariance. On the other hand, the electronic correlation effect
becomes the very base of many novel electronic states, such as high temperature
superconductivity, giant magnetoresistance etc. Here we report the discovery of
merging the two important components: Dirac electrons and the correlation
effect in heterostructured Bi2Te3/Fe1+dTe. By measuring the scanning tunneling
spectroscopy on Bi2Te3 thin films (a typical topological insulator) thicker
than 6 quintuple layers on top of the Fe1+dTe single crystal (a parent phase of
the iron based superconductors FeSe1-xTex), we observed the quantum oscillation
of Landau levels of the Dirac electrons and the gapped feature at the Fermi

ordinary understandings and must demonstrate some unexplored territory

effect.

works.
  Seven out of nine objects (78%) show morphological evidence for interactions

rate of morphological evidence for interaction is consistent with those found
during previous studies of QSO2 at similar z, suggesting that the merger rate

extended emission line structures have a variety of origins and ionization
mechanisms: star forming companions, tidal features, or extended ionized

the periphery give information about the community structure of the network,
aiding in community detection. A number of explicit results are derived,

application of this effect for the suppression of two-body collisional losses

perturbation treatment for coupling between the incident channel (IC) and the

the inter-atomic interaction potentials are real functions of the inter-atomic
distance, the exact s-wave inelastic scattering amplitude can always be
suppressed to \emph{zero} by coupling between the IC or the OC (or both of
them) and an extra isolated bound state. We further show that when the
low-energy inelastic collision between two ultracold atoms is suppressed by
this effect, the real part of the elastic scattering length between the atoms
is still possible to be much larger than the range of inter-atomic
interaction.In addition, when open scattering channels are coupled to two bound
states, with the help of the Fano effect, independent control of the elastic

and in which zonally-oriented bands of strong magnetic field accumulate below
the convective layers, in response to turbulent pumping from above in
successive magnetic half-cycles. Key aspects of this simulation include low
numerical dissipation and a strongly subadiabatic fluid layer underlying the
convectively unstable layers corresponding to the modeled solar convection
zone. These properties are conducive to the growth and development of
two-dimensional instabilities otherwise suppressed by stronger dissipation. We
find evidence for the action of a non-axisymmetric magnetoshear instability

investigate the possibility that the Tayler instability may be contributing to
the destabilization of the large-scale axisymmetric magnetic component at high

whereby the magnetic cycle is driven primarily by turbulent dynamo action in
the convecting layers, but MHD instabilities accelerate the dissipation of the
magnetic field pumped down into the overshoot and stable layers, thus perhaps
significantly influencing the magnetic cycle period. Support for this scenario
is found in the distinct global dynamo behaviors observed in an otherwise

Earth that couples tidal dissipation, with a temperature-dependent Maxwell
rheology, to orbital circularization and migration. We illustrate
thermal-orbital steady states where surface heat flow is balanced by tidal
dissipation and cooling can be stalled for billions of years until
circularization occurs. Orbital energy dissipated as tidal heat in the interior
drives both inward migration and circularization, with a circularization time
that is inversely proportional to the dissipation rate. We identify a peak in
the internal dissipation rate as the mantle passes through a visco-elastic
state at mantle temperatures near 1800 K. Planets orbiting a 0.1 solar-mass
star within $0.07$ AU circularize before 10 Gyr, independent of initial
eccentricity. Once circular, these planets cool monotonically and maintain
dynamos similar to Earth. Planets forced into eccentric orbits can experience a
super-cooling of the core and rapid core solidification, inhibiting dynamo
action for planets in the habitable zone. We find that tidal heating is
insignificant in the habitable zone around $0.45$ (or larger) solar mass stars
because tidal dissipation is a stronger function of orbital distance than
stellar mass, and the habitable zone is further from larger stars. Suppression
of the planetary magnetic field exposes the atmosphere to stellar wind erosion
and the surface to harmful radiation. In addition to weak magnetic fields,
massive melt eruption rates and prolonged magma oceans may render eccentric

the map has prescribed tangency to the boundary divisor, and certain quadruples
of marked points have prescribed cross-ratios. In particular, our results
generalize the results of Nishinou and Siebert. The proof is very short,

facilitate fast queries on large datasets. When new records arrive at a high
rate, it is infeasible to continuously update (maintain) MVs and a common
solution is to defer maintenance by batching updates together. Between batches
the MVs become increasingly stale with incorrect, missing, and superfluous rows
leading to increasingly inaccurate query results. We propose Stale View
Cleaning (SVC) which addresses this problem from a data cleaning perspective.
In SVC, we efficiently clean a sample of rows from a stale MV, and use the
clean sample to estimate aggregate query results. While approximate, the
estimated query results reflect the most recent data. As sampling can be
sensitive to long-tailed distributions, we further explore an outlier indexing
technique to give increased accuracy when the data distributions are skewed.
SVC complements existing deferred maintenance approaches by giving accurate and
bounded query answers between maintenance. We evaluate our method on a
generated dataset from the TPC-D benchmark and a real video distribution
application. Experiments confirm our theoretical results: (1) cleaning an MV
sample is more efficient than full view maintenance, (2) the estimated results
are more accurate than using the stale MV, and (3) SVC is applicable for a wide
variety of MVs.

important part of quantum theory. One example for such an abstraction can be
found in the distance lab paradigm: if two separated parties are connected via
a classical channel, it is notoriously difficult to characterize all possible
operations these parties can perform. This class of operations is widely known
as local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Surprisingly, the
situation becomes comparably simple if the more general class of separable
operations is considered, a finding which has been extensively used in quantum
information theory for many years. Here, we propose a related approach for the
resource theory of quantum coherence, where two distant parties can only
perform measurements which do not create coherence and can communicate their
outcomes via a classical channel. We call this class local incoherent
operations and classical communication (LICC). While the characterization of
this class is also difficult in general, we show that the larger class of
separable incoherent operations (SI) has a simple mathematical form, yet still
preserving the main features of LICC. We demonstrate the relevance of our
approach by applying it to three different tasks: assisted coherence
distillation, quantum teleportation, and single-shot quantum state merging. We
expect that the results obtained in this work also transfer to other concepts
of coherence which are discussed in recent literature. The approach presented
here opens new ways to study the resource theory of coherence in distributed
scenarios.

introduce a new LIOCC monotone that completely characterizes a state's optimal
rate of bipartite coherence distillation. This result allows us to precisely
quantify the difference in operational powers between global incoherent
operations, LIOCC, and local incoherent operations \textit{without} classical

entanglement if and only if entanglement can be distilled by LIOCC, and we
strengthen the well-known Horodecki criterion for distillability.

field interacting with real materials. For this, we implement the closed time
path formalism developed in previous works to study the case of two half spaces

retarded Green functions, we obtain the long-time limit of these contributions

baths' contribute, in agreement with the results of previous works, where this
was assumed without justification. We also study in detail the physics of the

theories considering the 2D WC to liquid transition in the clean limit, it was
suggested that a number of intermediate phases might exist. We have studied the
transformation between the metallic fluid phase and the low magnetic field
reentrant insulating phase (RIP) which was interpreted as due to WC formation
[Qiu et al, PRL 108, 106404 (2012)], in a strongly correlated 2D hole system
with large interaction parameter $r_s$ ($\sim~$20-30) and high mobility.
Instead of a sharp transition, we found that increasing density (or lowering
$r_s$) drives the RIP into a state where the incipient RIP coexists with Fermi
liquid. This apparent mixture phase intermediate between Fermi liquid and WC
also exhibits a non-trivial temperature dependent resistivity behavior which
may be qualitatively understood by the reversed melting of WC in the mixture,
in analogy to the Pomeranchuk effect in the solid-liquid mixture of Helium-3.

first observation of a Weyl fermion in nature and demonstrates a novel type of
anomalous surface state band structure, consisting of Fermi arcs. So far, work
has focused on Weyl semimetals with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However,
Weyl semimetals with weak SOC may allow tunable spin-splitting for device
applications and may exhibit a crossover to a spinless topological phase, such
as a Dirac line semimetal in the case of spinless TaAs. NbP, isostructural to
TaAs, may realize the first Weyl semimetal in the limit of weak SOC. Here we
study the surface states of NbP by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and we find that we $\textit{cannot}$ show Fermi arcs based on our
experimental data alone. We present an $\textit{ab initio}$ calculation of the
surface states of NbP and we find that the Weyl points are too close and the
Fermi level is too low to show Fermi arcs either by (1) directly measuring an
arc or (2) counting chiralities of edge modes on a closed path. Nonetheless,
the excellent agreement between our experimental data and numerical
calculations suggests that NbP is a Weyl semimetal, consistent with TaAs, and
that we observe trivial surface states which evolve continuously from the
topological Fermi arcs above the Fermi level. Based on these results, we
propose a slightly different criterion for a Fermi arc which, unlike (1) and
(2) above, does not require us to resolve Weyl points or the spin splitting of
surface states. We propose that raising the Fermi level by $> 20$ meV would
make it possible to observe a Fermi arc using this criterion in NbP. Our work
offers insight into Weyl semimetals with weak spin-orbit coupling, as well as
the crossover from the spinful topological Weyl semimetal to the spinless
topological Dirac line semimetal.

antennas $M$ is very large (typically 100), and generally much larger than the
number of spatially multiplexed data streams (typically 10). Unfortunately, the
front-end A/D conversion necessary to drive hundreds of antennas, with a signal
bandwidth of the order of 10 to 100 MHz, requires very large sampling bit-rate
and power consumption.
  In order to reduce such implementation requirements, Hybrid Digital-Analog
architectures have been proposed. In particular, our work in this paper is
motivated by one of such schemes named Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing
(JSDM), where the downlink precoder (resp., uplink linear receiver) is split
into the product of a baseband linear projection (digital) and an RF
reconfigurable beamforming network (analog), such that only a reduced number $m
\ll M$ of A/D converters and RF modulation/demodulation chains is needed. In
JSDM, users are grouped according to the similarity of their channel dominant
subspaces, and these groups are separated by the analog beamforming stage,
where the multiplexing gain in each group is achieved using the digital
precoder. Therefore, it is apparent that extracting the channel subspace
information of the $M$-dim channel vectors from snapshots of $m$-dim
projections, with $m \ll M$, plays a fundamental role in JSDM implementation.
  In this paper, we develop novel efficient algorithms that require sampling
only $m = O(2\sqrt{M})$ specific array elements according to a coprime sampling
scheme, and for a given $p \ll M$, return a $p$-dim beamformer that has a
performance comparable with the best p-dim beamformer that can be designed from
the full knowledge of the exact channel covariance matrix. We assess the
performance of our proposed estimators both analytically and empirically via
numerical simulations.

reveals that in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, MIMO-OWC offers both
large-scale diversity gain, governing the exponential decaying of the error
curve, and small-scale diversity gain, producing traditional power-law
decaying. Particularly for a two by two MIMO-OWC system with unipolar pulse
amplitude modulation (PAM), a closed-form solution to the design problem of a
linear FDSC optimizing both diversity gains is attained by taking advantage of
the available properties on the successive terms of Farey sequences in number
theory as well as by developing new properties on the disjoint intervals formed
by the Farey sequence terms to attack the continuous and discrete variables
mixed max-min design problem. In fact, this specific design not only proves
that a repetition code (RC) is the optimal linear FDSC optimizing both the
diversity gains, but also uncovers a significant difference between MIMO radio
frequency (RF) communications and MIMO-OWC that space dimension alone is
sufficient for a full large-scale diversity achievement. Computer simulations
demonstrate that FDSC substantially outperforms uncoded spatial multiplexing
with the same total optical power and spectral efficiency, and the latter

with current large-scale polarization data. Looking beyond $\Lambda$CDM,
including curvature uncertainty increases the forecast mass error by $\approx$
50% for S4+DESI, and more than doubles the error with a two-parameter dark
energy equation of state. Complementary low-redshift probes including galaxy
lensing will play a role in distinguishing between massive neutrinos and a
departure from a $w=-1$, flat geometry.

Parallel Grid Avalanche Counter detector (PGAC) was used at the exit of a
spectrograph magnet, enabling us to measure the intensity of several charge

constituted more than 99% of the total equilibrium charge state distribution
for that elements. Currently, little experimental data exists for equilibrium
charge state distributions for heavy ions with 19<Zp,Zt<54 (Zp and Zt, are the
projectile's and target's atomic numbers respectively). Hence the success of
the semi-empirical models in predicting typical characteristics of equilibrium
CSDs (mean charge states and distribution widths), has not been thoroughly
tested at the energy region of interest. A number of semi-empirical models from
the literature were evaluated in this study, regarding their ability to
reproduce the characteristics of the measured charge state distributions. The
evaluated models were selected from the literature based on whether they are
suitable for the given range of atomic numbers and on their frequent use by the
nuclear physics community. Finally, an attempt was made to combine model
predictions for the mean charge state, the distribution width and the
distribution shape, to come up with a more reliable model. We discuss this new
""combinatorial"" prescription and compare its results with our experimental data
and with calculations using the other semi-empirical models studied in this

of photos every day. These include large numbers of clothing and accessory
images. We would like to answer questions like `What outfit goes well with this
pair of shoes?' To answer these types of questions, one has to go beyond
learning visual similarity and learn a visual notion of compatibility across
categories. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework to help answer
these types of questions. The main idea of this framework is to learn a feature
transformation from images of items into a latent space that expresses
compatibility. For the feature transformation, we use a Siamese Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) architecture, where training examples are pairs of items
that are either compatible or incompatible. We model compatibility based on
co-occurrence in large-scale user behavior data; in particular co-purchase data
from Amazon.com. To learn cross-category fit, we introduce a strategic method
to sample training data, where pairs of items are heterogeneous dyads, i.e.,
the two elements of a pair belong to different high-level categories. While
this approach is applicable to a wide variety of settings, we focus on the
representative problem of learning compatible clothing style. Our results
indicate that the proposed framework is capable of learning semantic
information about visual style and is able to generate outfits of clothes, with
items from different categories, that go well together.

candidate X-ray counterparts within/close to the gamma-ray error box. The
brightest of these X-ray sources is variable with a period of 0.2245$\pm$0.0081
d. Its X-ray spectrum can be described by a power law with photon index
$\Gamma_X =1.36\pm0.09$, and hydrogen column density $N_{\rm H} < 4 \times
10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, which gives an unabsorbed 0.3--10 keV X-ray flux of $1.02

Optical/Near-Infrared Detector (GROND) discovered an optical counterpart to

features a flux modulation with a period of 0.22748$\pm$0.00043 d that
coincides, within the errors, with that of the X-ray source, confirming the
association based on the positional coincidence. We interpret the observed
X-ray/optical periodicity as the orbital period of a close binary system where
one of the two members is a neutron star. The light curve profile of the
companion star, with two asymmetric peaks, suggests that the optical emission
comes from two regions at different temperatures on its tidally-distorted
surface. Based upon its X-ray and optical properties, we consider this source
as the most likely X-ray counterpart to 3FGL J2039.6-5618, which we propose to

[BIP98]) and $n^{\Omega((\log k)/d)}$ (following from a recent formula size
lower bound of Rossman [Ros14]). Our lower bound is quite close to optimal,
since a simple construction gives depth-$d$ circuits of size $n^{O(k^{2/d})}$
for this problem (and strengthening our bound even to $n^{k^{\Omega(1/d)}}$

an important role in classical circuit lower bounds [Sip83, Yao85, H{\aa}s86].
A key ingredient in our proof of the required lower bound for these Sipser-like

us to obtain sharper quantitative bounds while employing simpler arguments,

In this paper, the constraints of standards candles on the cosmological
parameters are estimated for different cases. The dependence of the constraints
on the intrinsic scatter of the luminosity relation and the redshift
distribution of the standard candles is specifically investigated. The results,
especially for the constraints on the components of the universe, clearly show
that constraints from standard candles at different redshifts have different
degeneracy orientations, thus standard candles with a wide redshift
distribution can self break the degeneracy and improve the constraints
significantly. As a result of this, even with the current level of tightness of
known luminosity relations, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can give comparable
tightness of constraint with type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) on the components of
the universe as long as the redshifts of the GRBs are diversifying enough.
However, for a substantial constraint on the dark energy EOS, tighter
luminosity relations for GRBs are needed, since the constraints on the dark
energy from standard candles at high redshifts are very weak and are thus less
helpful in the degeneracy breaking.

a function of transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) in minimum-bias p-Pb collisions
at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV with ALICE at the LHC. The measurement covers
the $p_{\rm T}$ interval $0.5<p_{\rm T}<12$ GeV/$c$ and the rapidity range
$-1.06 < y_{\rm cms} < 0.14$ in the centre-of-mass reference frame. The
contribution of electrons from background sources was subtracted using an
invariant mass approach. The nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm pPb}$ was
calculated by comparing the $p_{\rm T}$-differential invariant cross section in
p-Pb collisions to a pp reference at the same centre-of-mass energy, which was
obtained by interpolating measurements at $\sqrt{s}= 2.76$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}
=7$ TeV. The $R_{\rm pPb}$ is consistent with unity within uncertainties of
about 25%, which become larger for $p_{\rm T}$ below 1 GeV/$c$. The measurement
shows that heavy-flavour production is consistent with binary scaling, so that
a suppression in the high-$p_{\rm T}$ yield in Pb-Pb collisions has to be
attributed to effects induced by the hot medium produced in the final state.
The data in p-Pb collisions are described by recent model calculations that
include cold nuclear matter effects.

event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76\,{\text{TeV}}$) with principal component
analysis (PCA). The PCA procedure finds two dominant contributions to the
two-particle correlation function. The leading component is identified with the
event plane $v_n(p_T)$, while the subleading component is responsible for
factorization breaking in hydrodynamics. For $v_0$, $v_1$, and $v_3$ the
subleading flow is a response to the radial excitation of the corresponding
eccentricity. By contrast, for $v_2$ the subleading flow in \emph{peripheral
collisions} is dominated by the nonlinear mixing between the leading elliptic
flow and radial flow fluctuations. In the $v_2$ case, the sub-sub-leading mode
more closely reflects the response to the radial excitation of $\varepsilon_2$.
A consequence of this picture is that the elliptic flow fluctuations and
factorization breaking change rapidly with centrality, and in central
collisions (where the leading $v_2$ is small and nonlinear effects can be
neglected) the subsub-leading mode becomes important. Radial flow fluctuations
and nonlinear mixing also play a significant role in the factorization breaking
of $v_4$ and $v_5$. We construct good geometric predictors for the orientation
and magnitudes of the leading and subleading flows based on a linear response
to the geometry, and a quadratic mixing between the leading principal
components. Finally, we suggest a set of measurements involving three point
correlations which can experimentally corroborate the nonlinear mixing of
radial and elliptic flow and its important contribution to factorization
breaking as a function of centrality.

phases under the Grand Tack model and in the absence of giant planets. These
simulations include a state-of-the-art collision model which allows multiple
collision outcomes, such as accretion, erosion, and bouncing events, that
enables tracking of the evolving core mass fraction of accreting planetesimals.
We show that the embryos grown during this intermediate stage of planet
formation exhibit a range of core mass fractions, and that with significant
dynamical excitation, enough mantle can be stripped from growing embryos to
account for the Earth's non-chondritic Fe/Mg ratio. We also find that there is
a large diversity in the composition of remnant planetesimals, with both

typical in most timing studies. We apply this extended framework both to

the residuals that when performing a standard timing analysis is highly
covariant with the signal expected from a gravitational wave (GW) background.
When working in the profile domain, these variations are de-correlated from the
expected GW signal, resulting in significant improvement in the obtained upper
limits. Using the PSR J1909$-$3744 data set from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array

variation resulting from non-Gaussian noise in the oldest observing system, but
no evidence for either detectable pulse jitter, or low-frequency profile shape

In the quasi-star scenario, black hole seeds experience an initial
super-Eddington growth, that in less than a million years may leave a
$10^4-10^5$ M$_{\odot}$ black hole at the centre of a protogalaxy at $z \sim
20-10$. Super-Eddington accretion, however, may be accompanied by vigorous mass
loss that can limit the amount of mass that reaches the black hole. In this
paper, we critically assess the impact of radiative driven winds, launched from
the surface of the massive envelopes from which the black hole accretes.
Solving the full wind equations coupled with the hydrostatic structure of the
envelope, we find mass outflows with rates between a few tens and $10^4$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, mainly powered by advection luminosity within the
outflow. We therefore confirm the claim by Dotan, Rossi & Shaviv (2011) that
mass losses can severely affect the black hole seed early growth within a
quasi-star. In particular, seeds with mass $>10^4$ M$_{\odot}$ can only form
within mass reservoirs $ \gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$, unless they are refilled at
huge rates ($ \gtrsim 100$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). This may imply that only

our new IRAM data with literature data and Spitzer/IRS spectroscopy, we study
the correspondence between these putative tracers of dense gas and the relative
contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation to the
mid-infrared luminosity of each system. We find the HCN (1-0) emission to be
enhanced in AGN-dominated systems ($\langle$L'$_{HCN (1-0)}$/L'$_{HCO^+

($\langle$L'$_{HCN (1-0)}$/L'$_{HCO^+ (1-0)}\rangle=1.14$, and 0.88,
respectively). However, some composite and starburst systems have L'$_{HCN
(1-0)}$/L'$_{HCO^+ (1-0)}$ ratios comparable to those of AGN, indicating that
enhanced HCN emission is not uniquely associated with energetically dominant
AGN. After removing AGN-dominated systems from the sample, we find a linear
relationship (within the uncertainties) between $\log_{10}$(L'$_{HCN (1-0)}$)
and $\log_{10}$(L$_{IR}$), consistent with most previous findings. L'$_{HCN
(1-0)}$/L$_{IR}$, typically interpreted as the dense gas depletion time,
appears to have no systematic trend with L$_{IR}$ for our sample of luminous
and ultraluminous infrared galaxies, and has significant scatter. The
galaxy-integrated HCN (1-0) and HCO+ (1-0) emission do not appear to have a
simple interpretation, in terms of the AGN dominance or the star formation
rate, and are likely determined by multiple processes, including density and
radiative effects.

provides a unique opportunity to study the environment of SNe at high z. We
exploit the time delay between multiple images to determine the properties of
the SN and its environment, before, during, and after the SN exploded. We use
the integral-field spectrograph MUSE on the VLT to simultaneously target all
observed and model-predicted positions of SN Refsdal. We find MgII emission at
all positions of SN Refsdal, accompanied by weak FeII* emission at two
positions. The measured ratios of [OII] to MgII emission of 10-20 indicate a
high degree of ionization with low metallicity. Because the same high degree of
ionization is found in all images, and our spatial resolution is too coarse to
resolve the region of influence of SN Refsdal, we conclude that this high
degree of ionization has been produced by previous SNe or a young and hot
stellar population. We find no variability of the [OII] line over a period of
57 days. This suggests that there is no variation in the [OII] luminosity of
the SN over this period, or that the SN has a small contribution to the
integrated [OII] emission over the scale resolved by our observations.

along the line-of-sight by the peculiar velocities of matter particles. These
redshift-space distortions will affect the contrast in the signal and will also
make it anisotropic. This anisotropy contains information about the
cross-correlation between the matter density field and the neutral hydrogen
field, and could thus potentially be used to extract information about the
sources of reionization. In this paper, we study a collection of simulated
reionization scenarios assuming different models for the sources of
reionization. We show that the 21-cm anisotropy is best measured by the
quadrupole moment of the power spectrum. We find that, unless the properties of
the reionization sources are extreme in some way, the quadrupole moment evolves
very predictably as a function of global neutral fraction. This predictability
implies that redshift-space distortions are not a very sensitive tool for
distinguishing between reionization sources. However, the quadrupole moment can
be used as a model-independent probe for constraining the reionization history.
We show that such measurements can be done to some extent by first-generation
instruments such as LOFAR, while the SKA should be able to measure the
reionization history using the quadrupole moment of the power spectrum to great
accuracy.

{\lambda} = 0.9, 2.8, 8.0, and 9.8 mm for DoAr25 and at {\lambda} = 1.3, 2.8,

origin is different from thermal dust emission from 5 cm observations. Directly
from interferometric data, we find that observations at 7 mm and 1 cm trace
emission from a compact disk while millimeter-wave observations trace an
extended disk structure. From a physical disk model, where we characterize the
disk structure of CY Tau and DoAr 25 at wavelengths shorter than 5 cm, we find
that (1) dust continuum emission is optically thin at the observed wavelengths
and over the spatial scales studied, (2) a constant value of the dust opacity
is not warranted by our observations, and (3) a high-significance radial
gradient of the dust opacity spectral index, {\beta}, is consistent with the
observed dust emission in both disks, with low-{\beta} in the inner disk and
high-{\beta} in the outer disk. Assuming that changes in dust properties arise
solely due to changes in the maximum particle size (amax), we constrain radial
variations of amax in both disks, from cm-sized particles in the inner disk (R
< 40 AU) to millimeter sizes in the outer disk (R > 80 AU). These observational
constraints agree with theoretical predictions of the radial-drift barrier,
however, fragmentation of dust grains could explain our amax(R) constraints if
these disks have lower turbulence and/or if dust can survive high-velocity

planets with C/O ratios $\sim$ 1 and $T_{\rm eff}$ $\gtrsim$ 1500 K can exhibit
inversions due to heating by the alkalis because the main coolants CH$_4$,
H$_2$O and HCN are depleted. Therefore, temperature inversions possibly occur
without the presence of additional absorbers like TiO and VO. At low
temperatures we find that the pressure level of the photosphere strongly
influences whether the atmospheric opacity is dominated by either water (for
low C/O) or methane (for high C/O), or both (regardless of the C/O). For hot,
carbon-rich objects this pressure level governs whether the atmosphere is
dominated by methane or HCN. Further we find that host stars of late spectral
type lead to planetary atmospheres which have shallower, more isothermal
temperature profiles. In agreement with prior work we find that for planets
with $T_{\rm eff}$ $<$ 1750 K the transition between water or methane dominated
spectra occurs at C/O $\sim$ 0.7, instead of $\sim$ 1, because condensation

describing viscous evolution of the disk properties, which are verified and
calibrated using 1D numerical calculations with realistic inputs. Injection of
angular momentum by the central binary suppresses mass accretion onto the
binary and causes radial distribution of the viscous angular momentum flux F_J
to be different from that in a standard accretion disk around a single star
with no torque at the center. Disks with no mass accretion at the center
develop F_J profile which is flat in radius. Radial profiles of temperature and
surface density are also quite different from those in disks around single
stars. Damping of the density waves driven by the binary and viscous
dissipation dominate heating of the inner disk (within 1-2 AU), pushing the
iceline beyond 3-5 AU, depending on disk mass and age. Irradiation by the
binary governs disk thermodynamics beyond ~10 AU. However, self-shadowing by
the hot inner disk may render central illumination irrelevant out to ~20 AU.
Spectral energy distribution of a circumbinary disk exhibits a distinctive bump
around 10 micron, which may facilitate identification of such disks around
unresolved binaries. Efficient tidal coupling to the disk drives orbital
inspiral of the binary and may cause low-mass and compact binaries to merge
into a single star within the disk lifetime. We generally find that
circumbinary disks present favorable sites for planet formation (despite wider
zone of volatile depletion), in agreement with the statistics of Kepler
circumbinary planets.

virtually identical to the International Celestial Reference Frame 2 (ICRF2).
They also yield a parallax for IM Peg of 10.37 $\pm$ 0.07 mas, corresponding to
a distance of 96.4 $\pm$ 0.7 pc. The uncertainties are standard errors with
statistical and estimated systematic contributions added in quadrature. These

high data rate, and spectrum scarcity at microwave bands make the millimeter
wave (mmWave) frequencies an important player in future wireless networks.
However, mmWave communication systems exhibit severe attenuation, blockage,
deafness, and may need microwave networks for coordination and fall-back
support. To compensate for high attenuation, mmWave systems exploit highly
directional operation, which in turn substantially reduces the interference
footprint. The significant differences between mmWave networks and legacy
communication technologies challenge the classical design approaches,
especially at the medium access control (MAC) layer, which has received
comparatively less attention than PHY and propagation issues in the literature
so far. In this paper, the MAC layer design aspects of short range mmWave
networks are discussed. In particular, we explain why current mmWave standards
fail to fully exploit the potential advantages of short range mmWave
technology, and argue for the necessity of new collision-aware hybrid resource
allocation frameworks with on-demand control messages, the advantages of a
collision notification message, and the potential of multihop communication to
provide reliable mmWave connections.

exploit finite size effects in the electronic structure of ultrathin Pd(111)

applicable to particle-laden fluid flows where two-way momentum coupling is
important. In the point-particle formulation, particle dynamics are coupled to
fluid dynamics via a source term that appears in the respective momentum
equations. When the particle Reynolds number is small and the particle diameter
is smaller than the fluid scales, it is common to approximate the momentum
coupling source term as the Stokes drag. The Stokes drag force depends on the
difference between the undisturbed fluid velocity evaluated at the particle
location, and the particle velocity. However, owing to two-way coupling, the
fluid velocity is modified in the neighborhood of a particle, relative to its
undisturbed value. This causes the computed Stokes drag force to be
underestimated in two-way coupled point-particle simulations. We develop
estimates for the drag force error as function of the particle size relative to
the grid size. We then develop a correction method that estimates the
undisturbed fluid velocity from the computed disturbed velocity field. The
correction scheme is tested for a particle settling in an otherwise quiescent
fluid and is found to reduce the error in computed settling velocity by an
order of magnitude compared with common interpolation schemes.

based on the known criterions of the interplay between the antiquark-quark

given $\bar{q}$-$q$ channel couplings with chiral symmetry and from the heavy
gluon exchange, the effects of the Fierz transformations are not enough to
change the feature that the models' vacua could only be in the pure
$\bar{q}$-$q$ condensate phases. However, for a given pure scalar $q$-$q$
channel coupling with the strength $H_S$, the Fierz transformations will lead
to the nontrivial effect that the model's vacuum could be in the expected
$q$-$q$ condensate phase only if $N_c<9$ and $H_S$ is small, and as the
increase of $N_c$ and $H_S$, the vacuum will get first in a coexistence phase

  by other authors",,,,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main aim of this article is to establish boundedness of singular
integrals with non-smooth kernels on product spaces. Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be
non-negative self-adjoint operators on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^{n_1})$ and
$L^2(\mathbb{R}^{n_2})$, respectively, whose heat kernels satisfy Gaussian
upper bounds. First, we obtain an atomic decomposition for functions in
$H^1_{L_1,L_2}(\mathbb{R}^{n_1}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_2})$ where the Hardy space
$H^1_{L_1,L_2}(\mathbb{R}^{n_1}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_2})$ associated with $L_1$
and $L_2$ is defined by square function norms, then prove an interpolation
property for this space. Next, we establish sufficient conditions for certain
singular integral operators to be bounded on the Hardy space
$H^1_{L_1,L_2}(\mathbb{R}^{n_1}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_2})$ when the associated
kernels of these singular integrals only satisfy regularity conditions
significantly weaker than those of the standard Calder\'on--Zygmund kernels. As
applications, we obtain endpoint estimates of the double Riesz transforms
associated to Schr\""dingier operators and a Marcinkiewicz-type spectral
multiplier theorem for non-negative self-adjoint operators on product spaces.

Previous work devoted to machine learning tasks with distributional inputs has
done so through pairwise kernel evaluations between pdfs (or sample sets).
While such an approach is fine for smaller datasets, the computation of an $N

estimators that work over pdfs have done so only with kernels that use
Euclidean metrics, like the $L_2$ distance. However, there are a myriad of

working in a primal space, without computing large Gram matrices. We provide an

manipulation. In robotic applications soft materials can store and release
energy, absorb impacts, increase compliance and increase the range of possible
shape profiles using minimal actuators. The shape changing ability is also a
potential tool to manipulate friction forces caused by contact with the
environment. These advantages are accompanied by challenges of soft material
actuation and the need to exploit frictional interactions to generate
locomotion. Accordingly, the design of soft robots involves exploitation of
continuum properties of soft materials for manipulating frictional interactions
that result in robot locomotion. The research presents design and control of a
soft body robot that uses its shape change capability for locomotion. The
bioinspired (caterpillar) modular robot design is a soft monolithic body which
interacts with the environment at discrete contact points (caterpillar
prolegs). The deformable body is actuated by muscle-like shape memory alloy
coils and the discrete contact points manipulate friction in a binary manner.
This novel virtual grip mechanism combines two materials with different
coefficients of frictions (sticky-slippery) to control the robot-environment
friction interactions. The research also introduces a novel control concept
that discretizes the robot-environment-friction interaction into binary states.
This facilitates formulation of a control framework that is independent of the
specific actuator or soft material properties and can be applied to
multi-limbed soft robots. The transitions between individual robot states are
assigned a reward that allow optimized state transition control sequences to be
calculated. This conceptual framework is extremely versatile and we show how it
can be applied to situations in which the robot loses limb function.

strain, the CrSe2 monolayer tends to be FM when the strain is larger than 2%.
The FM state is further stabilized when the strain is increased. Moreover, the
CrSe2 monolayer changes to be half-metallic when the tensile strain is larger
than 10%. While for the CrTe2 monolayer, the critical strain at which the
transition between the FM and AFM states occurs is compressive, of -1%.
Relatively small tensile strains of 4% and 2%, respectively, can enhance the

and sinks; it is said to compute a Boolean matrix $M$ that has a $1$ in the
entry $(i,j)$ iff there is a path from the $j$th source to the $i$th sink. The
smallest number of edges in a rectifier network computing $M$ is a classic
complexity measure on matrices, which has been studied for more than half a
century.
  We explore two well-known techniques that have hitherto found little to no
applications in this theory. Both of them build on a basic fact that depth-$2$
rectifier networks are essentially weighted coverings of Boolean matrices with
rectangles. We obtain new results by using fractional and greedy coverings
(defined in the standard way).
  First, we show that all fractional coverings of the so-called full triangular
matrix have cost at least $n\log n$. This provides (a fortiori) a new proof of
the tight lower bound on its depth-$2$ complexity (the exact value has been
known since 1965, but previous proofs are based on different arguments).
Second, we show that the greedy heuristic is instrumental in tightening the
upper bound on the depth-$2$ complexity of the Kneser-Sierpi\'nski
(disjointness) matrix. The previous upper bound is $O(n^{1.28})$, and we
improve it to $O(n^{1.17})$, while the best known lower bound is
$\Omega(n^{1.16})$. Third, using fractional coverings, we obtain a form of
direct product theorem that gives a lower bound on unbounded-depth complexity
of Kronecker (tensor) products of matrices. In this case, the greedy heuristic
shows (by an argument due to Lov\'asz) that our result is only a logarithmic
factor away from the ""full"" direct product theorem. Our second and third
results constitute progress on open problem 7.3 and resolve, up to a

have been studied via Glauber spin-flip Monte Carlo simulations in space

phenomena associated with the persistent spins, viz., time decay in the number
of unaffected spins, growth of the corresponding pattern and its fractal
dimensionality, for varying correlation length in the initial configurations,
prepared at different temperatures, at and above the critical value. It is
observed that the fractal dimensionality and the exponent describing the
power-law decay of persistence probability are strongly dependent upon the
relative values of nonequilibrium domain size and the initial equilibrium
correlation length. Via appropriate scaling analyses, these quantities have
been estimated for quenches from infinite and critical temperatures. The above
mentioned dependence is observed to be less pronounced in higher dimension. In
addition to these findings for the local persistence, we present results for
the global persistence as well. Further, important observations on the standard
domain growth problem are reported. For the latter, a controversy in $d=3$,
related to the value of the exponent for the power-law growth of the average
domain size with time, has been resolved.

on the numerical treatment of non-conforming grid interfaces. The interface
conditions are imposed weakly by the simultaneous approximation term technique
in combination with interface operators, which move the discrete solutions
between the grids on the interface. In particular, we consider interpolation
operators and projection operators. A norm-compatibility condition, which leads
to stability for first order hyperbolic systems, does not suffice for second

satisfied to derive an energy estimate for stability. We carry out eigenvalue
analyses to investigate the additional constraint and how it is related to
stability, and find that the projection operators have better stability
properties than the interpolation operators. In addition, a truncation error
analysis is performed to study the convergence property of the numerical

densities - especially in the case of low-power BSs - and the use of massive

maximize the offloading gains and minimize the interference challenges arising
from adding small cells. We consider two interference management approaches:
joint transmission (JT) with local precoding, where users are served
simultaneously by multiple BSs without requiring channel state information
exchanges among cooperating BSs, and resource blanking, where some macro BS
resources are left blank to reduce the interference in the small cell downlink.
A key advantage offered by massive MIMO is channel hardening, which enables to
predict instantaneous rates a priori. This allows us to develop a unified
framework, where resource allocation is cast as a network utility maximization
(NUM) problem, and to demonstrate large gains in cell-edge rates based on the
NUM solution. We propose an efficient dual subgradient based algorithm, which
converges towards the NUM solution. A scheduling scheme is also proposed to
approach the NUM solution. Simulations illustrate more than 2x rate gain for
10th percentile users vs. an optimal association without interference

such metallic states form one-dimensional wires of electrons or holes, with a
free charge density that increases with the system size, up to complete
screening of the polarization charge, and can also be controlled by the
specific edge or boundary configurations, e.g. through chemisorption of
hydrogen or sulfur atoms at the edges. For triangular islands, local polar
discontinuities occur even in the absence of a total dipole moment for the
island and lead to an accumulation of free carriers close to the edges,
providing a consistent explanation of previous experimental observations. To
further stress the universal character of these mechanisms, we show that polar
discontinuities give rise to metallic states also at inversion domain
boundaries. These findings underscore the potential of engineering
transition-metal-dichalcogenide nanostructures for manifold applications in
nano- and opto-electronics, spintronics, catalysis, and solar-energy

interval of supply is known. A particular assignment of supply to each vertex

on a vertex by s. The cost of x under s is defined as the sum of evacuation
times to x for all supplies given by s, and the median under s is defined as a
sink location which minimizes this cost. The regret for x under s is defined as
the cost of x under s minus the cost of the median under s. Then, the problem
is to find a sink location such that the maximum regret for all possible

this enhanced dissipation, certain models, notably the quadratic hilltop

requiring fewer mediator field ($O(10^4)$ for the quadratic hilltop potential)

olivines, directly evidenced by a coincident temporary disappearance of the
tail. The flareup likely reflects a disintegration event, which we suggest was
triggered by intense thermal stress established within the nucleus interior.
Photometric data reveal an increasingly dusty coma, indicative of volatile
depletion. A catastrophic mass loss rate of $\sim$10$^{5}$ kg s$^{-1}$ around

however, a temporal increase in $a_{\min}$ was also witnessed, possibly due to
swift dispersions of smaller grains swept away by radiation forces without
replenishment. Together with the fading profile of the light curve, a power law
dust size distribution with index $\gamma = 3.2 \pm 0.1$ is derived. We

sufficiently strong disorder. During its process towards localization, it was
found that the electronic states will be directly localized to an Anderson
insulator (with Chern number 0), without an intermediate Hall plateau with
Chern number 1. Here we investigate the topological origin of this phenomenon,
by calculating the band structures and Chern numbers for disordered supercells.
We find that on the route towards localization, there exists a hidden state
with Chern number 1, but it is too short and too fluctuating to be practically
observable. This intermediate state cannot be stabilized even after some ""smart
design"" of the model and this should be a universal phenomena for insulators
with high Chern numbers. By performing numerical scaling of conductances, we
also plot the renormalization group flows for this transition, with Chern
number 1 state as an unstable fixed point. This is distinct from known results,
and can be tested by experiments and further theoretical analysis.

robot in a sequence of odometry and perceptual observations, is typically
formulated as a combination of two subtasks: (1) bag-of-words image retrieval
and (2) post-verification using RANSAC geometric verification. The main
contribution of this study is the proposal of a novel post-verification
framework that achieves good precision recall trade-off in loop closure
detection. This study is motivated by the fact that not all loop closure
hypotheses are equally plausible (e.g., owing to mutual consistency between
loop closure constraints) and that if we have evidence that one hypothesis is
more plausible than the others, then it should be verified more frequently. We
demonstrate that the problem of loop closure detection can be viewed as an
instance of a multi-model hypothesize-and-verify framework and build guided
sampling strategies on the framework where loop closures proposed using image
retrieval are verified in a planned order (rather than in a conventional
uniform order) to operate in a constant time. Experimental results using a
stereo SLAM system confirm that the proposed strategy, the use of loop closure
constraints and robot trajectory hypotheses as a guide, achieves promising
results despite the fact that there exists a significant number of false
positive constraints and hypotheses.

of CO in the post-shock gas triggers the formation of C-bearing species such as
HCN and CS. Most of the modelled molecular abundances agree well with the
latest values derived from Herschel data. Clusters of alumina are produced
within 2 Rstar and lead to a population of alumina grains close to the stellar
surface. Clusters of silicates form at larger radii (r > 3 Rstar), where their
nucleation is triggered by the formation of HSiO and H2SiO. They efficiently
condense and reach their final grain size distribution between ~ 6 and 8 Rstar,
with a major population of medium size grains peaking at~ 0.02 microns. This
two dust-shell configuration agrees with recent interferometric observations.

unique viewpoint that is invariant to moving objects, clutter, occlusions, and

functions. Indeed, when isogeometric spaces are constructed from $p$-degree
splines (and extensions, such as NURBS), they enjoy up to $C^{p-1}$ continuity
within each patch. However, global continuity beyond $C^0$ on so-called
multi-patch geometries poses some significant difficulties. In this work, we
consider planar multi-patch domains that have a parametrization which is only
$C^0$ at the patch interface. On such domains we study the $h$-refinement of
$C^1$-continuous isogeometric spaces. These spaces in general do not have
optimal approximation properties. The reason is that the $C^1$-continuity
condition easily over-constrains the solution which is, in the worst cases,
fully locked to linears at the patch interface. However, recent studies by Kapl
et al. have given numerical evidence that optimal convergence occurs for
bilinear two-patch geometries and cubic (or higher degree) $C^1$ splines. This
is the starting point of our study. We introduce the class of analysis-suitable
$G^1$ geometry parametrizations, which includes piecewise bilinear
parametrizations. We then analyze the structure of $C^1$ isogeometric spaces
over analysis-suitable $G^1$ parametrizations and, by theoretical results and
numerical testing, discuss their approximation properties. We also consider
examples of geometry parametrizations that are not analysis-suitable, showing
that in this case optimal convergence of $C^1$ isogeometric spaces is

promising candidate for an r-process site. They exhibit three different
channels for matter ejection fulfilling these conditions: dynamic ejecta due to
tidal torques, neutrino-driven winds and evaporating matter from the accretion
disk. We present a first study of the integrated nucleosynthesis for a
neutrino-driven wind from a neutron star merger with a hyper-massive neutron
star. Trajectories from a recent hydrodynamical simulation are divided into
four different angle regions and post-processed with a reaction network. We
find that the electron fraction varies around $Y_e \approx 0.1 - 0.4$, but its
distribution differs for every angle of ejection. Hence, the wind ejecta do not
undergo a robust r-process, but rather possess distinct nucleosynthesis yields
depending on the angle range. Compared to the dynamic ejecta, a smaller amount
of neutron-rich matter gets unbound, but the production of lighter heavy
elements with $A \lesssim 130$ in the neutrino-driven wind can complement the

weights we show that in the case where the coagulation coefficient grows
linearly and the detailed balance coefficients are of typical form, one can
obtain a linear functional inequality for the dissipation of the relative free
energy. This results in showing Cercignani's conjecture for the Becker-D\""oring

equilibrium. We also show that for all other typical cases one can obtain an
'almost' Cercignani's conjecture that results in an algebraic rate of
convergence to equilibrium. Additionally, we show that if one assumes an

microscopic dynamics is the ultimate goal of statistical mechanics. Despite the
fact that the theory is more than 100 years old, we are still discussing its
foundations and its regime of applicability. A point of crucial importance is
the definition of the notion of thermal equilibrium, which is given as the
state that maximises the von Neumann entropy. Here we argue that it is
necessary to propose a new way of describing thermal equilibrium, focused on
observables rather than on the full state of the quantum system. We
characterise the notion of thermal equilibrium, for a given observable, via the
maximisation of its Shannon entropy and highlight the thermal properties that
such a principle heralds. The relation with Gibbs ensembles is brought to
light. Furthermore, we apply such a notion of equilibrium to a closed quantum
systems and prove that there is always a class of observables which exhibits
thermal equilibrium properties and we give a recipe to explicitly construct
them. Eventually, we bring to light an intimate connection of such a principle
with the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis.

especially in the presence of measurement noise. To alleviate the problem of
spurious causality, Haufe et al. (2013) proposed to contrast measures of
information flow obtained on the original data against the same measures
obtained on time-reversed data. They show that this procedure, time-reversed
Granger causality (TRGC), robustly rejects causal interpretations on mixtures
of independent signals. While promising results have been achieved in
simulations, it was so far unknown whether time reversal leads to valid
measures of information flow in the presence of true interaction. Here we prove
that, for linear finite-order autoregressive processes with unidirectional
information flow, the application of time reversal for testing Granger
causality indeed leads to correct estimates of information flow and its
directionality. Using simulations, we further show that TRGC is able to infer
correct directionality with similar statistical power as the net Granger
causality between two variables, while being much more robust to the presence
of measurement noise.

we choose Muse to collect data which is a portable headband launched lately
with a number of useful functions and channels and it is much easier for the
public to use. Besides, traditional online analysis did not focus on the
synchronism between users and computers and the time delay problem did exist.
To solve the problem, by building the Analytic Hierarchy Model, we choose the
two gamma wave channels of F7 and F8 as the data source instead of using both
beta and alpha channels traditionally.Using the Common Space Pattern algorithm
and the Support Vector Machine model, the channels we choose have a higher
recognition accuracy rate and smaller amount of data to be dealt with by the
computer than the traditional ones. Furthermore, we make use of the Feedforward
Neural Network Model to predict subjects'brain states in half a second.
Finally, we design a plane program in Python where a plane can be controlled to
go up or down when users concentrate or relax. The SVM model and the
Feedforward Neural Network model have both been tested by 12 subjects and they
give an evaluation ranging from 1 to 10 points. The former gets 7.58 points
while the latter gets 8.83, which proves that the time delay problem is
improved once more.

constant $w$ equation of state parameter and in Chevalier - Polarski - Linder
(CPL) parametrization where $w$ is allowed to evolve with redshift: $w(z) = w_0
+ w_1 \frac{z}{1+z}$. We assume spherically symmetric mass distribution in
lensing galaxies, but relax the rigid assumption of SIS model in favor to more
general power-law index $\gamma$, also allowing it to evolve with redshifts
$\gamma(z)$. Our results for the $XCDM$ cosmology show the agreement with
values (concerning both $w$ and $\gamma$ parameters) obtained by other authors.
We go further and constrain the CPL parameters jointly with $\gamma(z)$. The
resulting confidence regions for the parameters are much better than those
obtained with a similar method in the past. They are also showing a trend of
being complementary to the supernova Ia data. Our analysis demonstrates that
strong gravitational lensing systems can be used to probe cosmological
parameters like the cosmic equation of state for dark energy. Moreover, they
have a potential to judge whether the cosmic equation of state evolved with

detection due to their ultra-strong magnetic fields and high spin frequencies.
Within the scenario of a growing tilt angle between the star's spin and
magnetic axis, due to the effect of internal viscosity, we obtain improved
estimates of the stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) from
magnetic deformation of newly born magnetars. We find that the GW background
spectra contributed by the magnetars with ultra-strong toroidal magnetic fields
of 10^{17} G could roughly be divided into four segments. Most notably, in
contrast to the background spectra calculated by assuming constant tilt angles
\chi=\pi/2, the background radiation above 1000 Hz are seriously suppressed.
However, the background radiation at the frequency band \sim100-1000 Hz are
moderately enhanced, depending on the strengths of the dipole magnetic fields.
We suggest that if all newly born magnetars indeed have toroidal magnetic
fields of 10^{17} G, the produced SGWBs should show sharp variations with the
observed frequency at several tens to about 100 hertz. If these features could
be observed through sophisticated detection of the SGWB using the proposed
Einstein Telescope, it will provide us a direct evidence of the tilt angle
evolutions and further some deep understandings about the properties of newly
born magnetars.

density fluctuations below proton scales are due to kinetic Alfv`en waves, we

representation of this nature is said to be sparse. In the present context
sparsity is accomplished by greedy selection of the spectral components, from
an overcomplete set called a dictionary. The proposed algorithm is tailored to
be applied with trigonometric dictionaries. Its distinctive feature being that
it avoids the need for the actual construction of the whole dictionary, by
implementing the required operations via the Fast Fourier Transform. The
achieved sparsity is theoretically equivalent to that rendered by the
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit method. The contribution of the proposed dedicated
implementation is to extend the applicability of the standard Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit algorithm, by reducing its storage and computational demands.
The suitability of the approach for producing sparse spectral models is
illustrated by comparison with the traditional method, in the line of the Short
Time Fourier Transform, involving only the corresponding orthonormal
trigonometric basis.

schemes. Currently, solid-state qubits, and in particular the superconducting
ones, seem to satisfy the requirements for being the building blocks of viable
quantum computers, since they exhibit relatively long coherence times,
extremely low dissipation, and scalability. The possibility of achieving
quantum coherence in macroscopic circuits comprising Josephson junctions,
envisioned by Legett in the 1980's, was demonstrated for the first time in a
charge qubit; since then, the exploitation of macroscopic quantum effects in
low-capacitance Josephson junction circuits allowed for the realization of
several kinds of superconducting qubits. Furthermore, coupling between qubits
has been successfully achieved that was followed by the construction of
multiple-qubit logic gates and the implementation of several algorithms. Here
it is demonstrated that induced qubit lattice coherence as well as two
remarkable quantum coherent optical phenomena, i.e., self-induced transparency
and Dicke-type superradiance, may occur during light-pulse propagation in
quantum metamaterials comprising superconducting charge qubits. The generated
qubit lattice pulse forms a compound ""quantum breather"" that propagates in
synchrony with the electromagnetic pulse. The experimental confirmation of such
effects in superconducting quantum metamaterials may open a new pathway to
potentially powerful quantum computing.

concept which uses a Compton camera whose field-of-view is restricted by a BGO
shield to a few degree (narrow-FOV Compton camera). In this concept, the
background from outside the FOV can be heavily suppressed by constraining the
incident direction of the gamma ray reconstructed by the Compton camera to be
consistent with the narrow FOV. We, for the first time, demonstrate the
validity of the concept using background data taken during the thermal vacuum
test and the low-temperature environment test of the flight model of SGD on
ground. We show that the measured background level is suppressed to less than
10\% by combining the event rejection using the anti-coincidence trigger of the
active BGO shield and by using Compton event reconstruction techniques. More
than 75\% of the signals from the field-of-view are retained against the
background rejection, which clearly demonstrates the improvement of
signal-to-noise ratio. The estimated effective area of 22.8~cm$^2$ meets the

for decades and represents one of the best studied cases of an edge-on galaxy.
We use deep PACS data together with IRAC, MIPS and SPIRE data to study the
vertical extent of dust emission around NGC 891. We also test the presence of a
more extended, thick dust component. By performing a convolution of an
intrinsic vertical profile emission with each instrument PSF and comparing it
with observations we derived the scaleheight of a thin and thick dust disc
component. For all wavelengths considered the emission is best fit with the sum
of a thin and a thick dust component. The scaleheight of both dust components
shows a gradient passing from 70 $\mu$m to 250 $\mu$m. This could be due to a
drop in dust heating (and thus dust temperature) with the distance from the
plane, or to a sizable contribution ($\sim 15 - 80%$) of an unresolved thin
disc of hotter dust to the observed surface brightness at shorter wavelengths.
The scaleheight of the thick dust component, using observations from 70 $\mu$m
to 250 $\mu$m has been estimated to be $(1.44\pm 0.12)$ kpc, consistent with
previous estimates (extinction and scattering in optical bands and MIR
emission). The amount of dust mass at distances larger than $\sim 2$ kpc from
the midplane represents $2 - 3.3$ % of the total galactic dust mass and the
relative abundance of small grains with respect to large grains is almost
halved comparing to that in the midplane. The paucity of small grains high
above the midplane might indicate that dust is hit by interstellar shocks or
galactic fountains and entrained together with gas. The halo dust component is
likely to be embedded in an atomic / molecular gas and heated by a thick
stellar disc.

  Rooted Paths in Linear Time","83 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we show how to combine two algorithmic techniques to obtain
linear time algorithms for various optimization problems on graphs, and present
a subroutine which will be useful in doing so.
  The first technique is iterative shrinking. In the first phase of an
iterative shrinking algorithm, we construct a sequence of graphs of decreasing
size $G_1,\ldots,G_\ell$ where $G_1$ is the initial input, $G_\ell$ is a graph
on which the problem is easy, and $G_i$ is obtained from $G_{i+1}$ via some
shrinking algorithm. In the second phase we work through the sequence in
reverse, repeatedly constructing a solution for a graph from the solution for
its successor. In an iterative compaction algorithm, we insist that the graphs
decrease by a constant fraction of the entire graph.
  Another approach to solving optimization problems is to exploit the
structural properties implied by the connectivity of the input graph. This
approach can be used on graphs which are not highly connected by decomposing an
input graph into its highly connected pieces, solving subproblems on these
specially structured pieces and then combining their solutions.
  We combine these two techniques by developing compaction algorithms which
when applied to the highly connected pieces preserve their connectivity
properties. The structural properties this connectivity implies can be helpful
both in finding further compactions in later iterations and when we are
manipulating solutions in the second phase of an iterative compaction
algorithm.
  To illustrate how this compaction algorithm can be used as a subroutine, we
present a linear time algorithm that given four vertices $\{s_1,s_2,t_1,t_2\}$
of a graph $G$, either finds a pair of disjoint paths $P_1$ and $P_2$ of $G$
such that $P_i$ has endpoints $s_i$ and $t_i$, or returns a planar embedding of
an auxiliary graph which shows that no such pair exists.

renormalised local observables for quantum matter fields, in a given quantum
state, on a rotating black hole spacetime. The rotating black hole may be
surrounded by a Dirichlet mirror, if necessary, such that a regular,
isometry-invariant vacuum state can be defined. We focus on the case of a
massive scalar field on a (2+1)-dimensional rotating black hole, but the method
can be extended to other types of matter fields and higher-dimensional rotating
black holes.
  The Feynman propagator of the matter field in the regular, isometry-invariant
state is written as a sum over mode solutions on the complex Riemannian section
of the black hole. A Hadamard renormalisation procedure is implemented at the
level of the Feynman propagator by expressing its singular part as a sum over
mode solutions on the complex Riemannian section of rotating Minkowski
spacetime. This allows us to explicitly renormalise local observables such as
the vacuum polarisation of the quantum field.
  The method is applied to the vacuum polarisation of a real massive scalar
field on a (2+1)-dimensional warped AdS3 black hole surrounded by a mirror.
Selected numerical results are presented, demonstrating the numerical efficacy
of the method. The existence of classical superradiance and the classical
linear mode stability of the warped AdS3 black hole to massive scalar field
perturbations are also analysed.

solution based on column generation. We start by formulating the problem as a
path-based mathematical program called the primal, for which we derive the
corresponding dual problem. We then propose an initial solution which is used,
first, by the dual problem and then by the primal problem to obtain a final
solution. Unlike most approaches, our focus is not only on embedding accuracy
but also on the scalability of the solution. In particular, the one-shot nature
of our formulation ensures embedding accuracy, while the use of column
generation is aimed at enhancing the computation time to make the approach more
scalable. In order to assess the performance of the proposed solution, we
compare it against four state of the art approaches as well as the optimal
link-based formulation of the one-shot embedding problem. Experiments on a
large mix of Virtual Network (VN) requests show that our solution is near
optimal (achieving about 95% of the acceptance ratio of the optimal solution),
with a clear improvement over existing approaches in terms of VN acceptance
ratio and average Substrate Network (SN) resource utilization, and a
considerable improvement (92% for a SN of 50 nodes) in time complexity compared
to the optimal solution.

exciton transitions in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is less advanced,
principally due to the sub-nanosecond dephasing. Conversely, owing to their
robust coupling to light, one can apply tools of nonlinear spectroscopy to
achieve all-optical command. Here, we report on the coherent manipulation of an
exciton via multi-wave mixing. Specifically, we employ three resonant pulses
driving a single InAs QD. The first two induce a four-wave mixing (FWM)
transient, which is projected onto a six-wave mixing (SWM) depending on the
delay and area of the third pulse, in agreement with analytical predictions.
Such a switch enables to demonstrate the generation of SWM on a single emitter
and to engineer the spectro-temporal shape of the coherent response originating
from a TLS. These results pave the way toward multi-pulse manipulations of
solid state qubits via implementing the NMR-like control schemes in the optical

charged strange quark stars composed of a charged perfect fluid are studied.
For this purpose, it is considered that the perfect fluid follows the MIT bag
model equation of state and the radial charge distribution follows a power-law.
The hydrostatic equilibrium and the stability of charged strange stars are
investigated through the numerical solutions of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
equation and the Chandrasekhar's pulsation equation, being these equations
modified from their original form to include the electrical charge. In order to
appreciably affect the stellar structure, it is found that the total charge
should be of order $10^{20}[\rm C]$, implying an electric field of around
$10^{22}[\rm V/m]$. We found the electric charge that produces considerable
effect on the structure and stability of the object is close to the star's
surface. We obtain that for a range of central energy density the stability of
the star decreases with the increment of the total charge and for a range of
total mass the electric charge helps to grow the stability of the stars under
study. We show that the central energy density used to reach the maximum mass
value is the same used to determine the zero eigenfrequency of the fundamental
mode when the total charge is fixed, thus indicating that the maximum mass
point marks the onset of instability. In other words, when fixing the total
charge, the conditions $\frac{dM}{d\rho_c}>0$ and $\frac{dM}{d\rho_c}<0$ are
necessary and sufficient to determine the stable and unstable equilibrium
configurations regions against radial oscillations.

  Decade-long research on computational physics and on effective field theories
facilitate the assessment of the presumption that quark masses and strong and
electromagnetic coupling constants suffice to parameterize the nuclear chart.
By presenting the current status of that enterprise, this article touches the
methodology of predicting nuclei by simulating the constituting quarks and
gluons and the development of effective field theories as appropriate
representations of the fundamental theory.
  While the nuclear spectra and electromagnetic responses analyzed
computationally so far with lattice QCD are in close resemblance to those which
intrigued experimentalists a century ago, they also test the theoretical
understanding which was unavailable to guide the nuclear pioneers but developed
since then. This understanding is shown to be deficient in terms of
correlations amongst nuclear observables and their sensitivity to fundamental
parameters. By reviewing the transition from one effective field theory to
another, from QCD to pionful chiral theories to pionless and eventually to
cluster theories, we identify some of those deficiencies and conceptual
problems awaiting a solution before QCD can be identified as the high-energy

Boolean network $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^n$ and its interaction graph, which is
the arc-signed digraph $G$ on $\{1,\dots,n\}$ that describes the positive and
negative influences between the components of the network. A fundamental
theorem of Aracena says that if $G$ has no positive (resp. negative) cycle,
then $f$ has at most (resp. at least) one fixed point; the sign of a cycle
being the product of the signs of its arcs. In this note, we generalize this
result by taking into account the influence of connections between positive and
negative cycles. In particular, we prove that if every positive (resp.
negative) cycle of $G$ has an arc $a$ such that $G\setminus a$ has a
non-trivial initial strongly connected component containing the terminal vertex
of $a$ and only negative (resp. positive) cycles, then $f$ has at most (resp.
at least) one fixed point. This is, up to our knowledge, the first
generalization of Aracena's theorem where the conditions are expressed with $G$

kernels with exponential decay which were shown to represent various Riemannian
geometries on a data set sampled from a manifold embedded in Euclidean space.
Moreover, local kernels were used to represent a diffeomorphism, H, between a
data set and a feature of interest using an anisotropic kernel function,
defined by a covariance matrix based on the local derivatives, DH. In this
paper, we generalize the theory of local kernels to represent degenerate
mappings where the intrinsic dimension of the data set is higher than the
intrinsic dimension of the feature space. First, we present a rigorous method
with asymptotic error bounds for estimating DH from the training data set and
feature values. We then derive scaling laws for the singular values of the
local linear structure of the data, which allows the identification the tangent
space and improved estimation of the intrinsic dimension of the manifold and
the bandwidth parameter of the diffusion maps algorithm. Using these numerical
tools, our approach to feature identification is to iterate the diffusion map
with appropriately chosen local kernels that emphasize the features of
interest. We interpret the iterated diffusion map (IDM) as a discrete
approximation to an intrinsic geometric flow which smoothly changes the
geometry of the data space to emphasize the feature of interest. When the data
lies on a product manifold of the feature manifold with an irrelevant manifold,
we show that the IDM converges to the quotient manifold which is isometric to
the feature manifold, thereby eliminating the irrelevant dimensions. We will
also demonstrate empirically that if we apply the IDM to features that are not
a quotient of the data space, the algorithm identifies an intrinsically
lower-dimensional set embedding of the data which better represents the
features.

  A unique ergodicity theorem for the distribution of leaves follows: for any

used the data from the TESIS EUV telescopes obtained in the Fe 171 A and He 304
A lines, and above 2 $R_\odot$, we used the observations of the LASCO C2 and C3
coronagraphs. The CME was formed at a distance of 0.2-0.5 $R_\odot$from the
Sun's surface as a U-shaped structure, which was observed both in the 171 A
images and in white-light. Observations in the He 304 A line showed that the
CME was associated with an erupting prominence, which was located not above-as
predicts the standard model-but in the lowest part of the U-shaped structure
close to the magnetic X-point. The prominence location can be explained with
the CME breakout model. Estimates showed that CME mass increased with time. The
CME trajectory was curved-its helio-latitude decreased with time. The CME
started at latitude of 50$^{\circ}$ and reached the ecliptic plane at distances
of 2.5 $R_\odot$. The CME kinematics can be divided into three phases: initial
acceleration, main acceleration, and propagation with constant velocity. After
the CME onset GOES registered a sub-A-class flare.

and extracting information from them is an important research area. Early
algorithms on mining communities have focused on the global structure, and
often run in time functional to the size of the entire graph. Nowadays, as we
often explore networks with billions of vertices and find communities of size
hundreds, it is crucial to shift our attention from macroscopic structure to
microscopic structure when dealing with large networks. A growing body of work
has been adopting local expansion methods in order to identify the community
from a few exemplary seed members.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for finding overlapping
communities called LEMON (Local Expansion via Minimum One Norm). Different from
PageRank-like diffusion methods, LEMON finds the community by seeking a sparse
vector in the span of the local spectra such that the seeds are in its support.
We show that LEMON can achieve the highest detection accuracy among
state-of-the-art proposals. The running time depends on the size of the
community rather than that of the entire graph. The algorithm is easy to
implement, and is highly parallelizable.
  Moreover, given that networks are not all similar in nature, a comprehensive
analysis on how the local expansion approach is suited for uncovering
communities in different networks is still lacking. We thoroughly evaluate our
approach using both synthetic and real-world datasets across different domains,
and analyze the empirical variations when applying our method to inherently
different networks in practice. In addition, the heuristics on how the quality
and quantity of the seed set would affect the performance are provided.

affects the result. Inspired by the concept of the commutator $[x,y]=

simultaneously under the assumption that they share the same abundance scale.
This assumption might have implications in different astrophysical contexts. We
aim to ascertain a methodology capable of producing a consistent metallicity
scale for giants and dwarfs. To achieve that, we analyzed giants and dwarfs in
the Hyades open cluster. All these stars have archival high-resolution
spectroscopic data obtained with HARPS and UVES. In addition, the giants have
interferometric measurements of the angular diameters. We analyzed the sample
with two methods. The first method constrains the atmospheric parameters
independently from spectroscopy. For that we present a novel calibration of
microturbulence based on 3D model atmospheres. The second method is the
classical spectroscopic based on Fe lines. We also tested two line lists in an
attempt to minimize possible non-LTE effects and to optimize the treatment of
the giants. We show that it is possible to obtain a consistent metallicity
scale between dwarfs and giants. The preferred method should constrain the
three parameters $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log~g$, and $\xi$ independent of
spectroscopy. In particular, the lines should be chosen to be free of blends in
the spectra of giants. When attention is paid to the line list, the classical
spectroscopic method can also produce consistent results. The metallicities
derived with the well-constrained set of stellar parameters are consistent
independent of the line list used. Therefore, for this cluster we favor the
metallicity of +0.18$\pm$0.03 dex obtained with this method. The classical
spectroscopic analysis, using the line list optimized for the giants, provides
a metallicity of +0.14$\pm$0.03 dex, in agreement with previous works.

vicinity of the Galactic Center (GC) (Falcke and Marko 2013) cannot be emitted
by the gas of the accretion disk since the accreting plasma is prevented from
approaching to the GC by the abnormally strong radial magnetic field. These
fields obstruct the infalling accretion flow from the inner region of the disk
and the central massive black hole in the standard model. It is expected that
the observed radiations near the Galactic Center cannot be generated by the
central black hole.
  We also demonstrate that the observed ultra-strong radial magnetic field near
the Galactic Center ( Eatough et al., 2013) cannot be generated by the -
turbulence dynamo mechanism of Parker since preliminary qualitative estimate in
terms of this mechanism gives a magnetic field strength six orders of magnitude
smaller than the observed field strength at . However, both these difficulties
or the dilemma of the standard model can be overcome if the central black hole
in the standard model is replaced by a supper-massive stellar object containing
magnetic monopoles ( SMSOMM, Peng and Chou, 2001). The observed power peaking
of the thermal radiation is essentially the same as our theoretical prediction.
In addition, the discovery of the ultra-strong radial magnetic field near the
Galactic Center can be naturally explained and is consistent with the
prediction of our model( Peng and Chou 2001). Furthermore, the observed
ultra-strong radial magnetic field in the vicinity of the Galactic Center may
be considered as the astronomical evidence for the existence of magnetic
monopoles as predicted by the Grand Unified Theory of particle physics.

show that the relative (with respect to SPS dijets and to the BFKL
Mueller-Navelet (MN) jets) contribution of DPS is growing at large rapidity
distance between jets. The calculated differential cross sections as a function
of rapidity distance between the most remote in rapidity jets are compared with
recent results of LL and NLL BFKL calculations for the Mueller-Navelet jet
production at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. Our results for four-jet sample are compared

good agreement is achieved. We propose to impose different cuts in order to
enhance the relative DPS contribution. The relative DPS contribution increases
when decreasing the lower cut on the jet transverse momenta as well as when a
low lower cut on the rapidity distance between the most remote jets is imposed.

topologically-distinct flux domains, are prime locations in three-dimensional
magnetic fields for reconnection, especially in the magnetosphere between the
planetary and interplanetary magnetic field and also in the solar atmosphere.
Little is known about the details of separator reconnection and so the aim of
this paper, which is the first of two, is to study the properties of magnetic
reconnection at a single separator. Three-dimensional, resistive
magnetohydrodynamic numerical experiments are run to study separator
reconnection starting from a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium which contains a
twisted current layer along a single separator linking a pair of
opposite-polarity null points. The resulting reconnection occurs in two phases.
The first is short involving rapid-reconnection in which the current at the
separator is reduced by a factor of around 2.3. Most ($75\%$) of the magnetic
energy is converted during this phase, via Ohmic dissipation, directly into
internal energy, with just $0.1\%$ going into kinetic energy. During this phase
the reconnection occurs along most of the separator away from its ends (the
nulls), but in an asymmetric manner which changes both spatially and temporally
over time. The second phase is much longer and involves slow impulsive-bursty
reconnection. Again Ohmic heating dominates over viscous damping. Here, the
reconnection occurs in small localised bursts at random anywhere along the
separator.

(Delta_I~6mag) in the recent past, which have been attributed to events of

Sept.2013, which we have previously analyzed through optical and near-IR
spectroscopy. To investigate the current active phase of V1180 Cas, we
performed observations with the Chandra satellite to study the X-ray emission
from the object and its connection to accretion episodes. Chandra observations
were performed in early Aug.2014. Complementary JHK photometry and J-band
spectra were taken at our Campo Imperatore facility to relate the X-ray and
near-IR emission from the target. We observe a peak of X-ray emission at the
nominal position of V1180 Cas. This signal corresponds to an X-ray luminosity
L_X(0.5-7 kev) in the range 0.8-2.2e30 erg/s. Based on the relatively short
duration of the dim states in the light curve and on stellar luminosity
considerations, we explored the possibility that the brightness minima of V1180
Cas are driven by extinction variations. From the analysis of the spectral
energy distribution of the high state we infer a stellar luminosity of 0.8-0.9
Lsun and find that the derived L_X is comparable to the average X-ray
luminosities of T Tauri stars. Moreover, the X-ray luminosity is lower than the
X-ray emission levels of 5e30 -1e31 erg/s detected at outbursts in similar
low-mass objects. Our analysis suggests that at least part of the photometric
fluctuations of V1180 Cas might be extinction effects rather than the result of
accretion excess emission. However, as the source displays spectral features
indicative of active accretion, we speculate that its photometric variations
might be the result of a combination of accretion-induced and extinction-driven
effects, as suggested for other young variables, such as V1184 Tau and V2492
Cyg.

the nature of the plasma motions resulting from spontaneous reconnection at a
3D separator. In order to clearly see these perturbations, we start from a
magnetohydrostatic equilibrium containing two oppositely-signed null points
joined by a generic separator along which lies a twisted current layer. The
nature of the magnetic reconnection initiated in this equilibrium as a result
of an anomalous diffusivity is discussed in detail in \cite{Stevenson15_jgra}.
The resulting sudden loss of force balance inevitably generates waves that
propagate away from the diffusion region carrying the dissipated current. In
their wake a twisting stagnation-flow, in planes perpendicular to the
separator, feeds flux back into the original diffusion site (the separator) in
order to try to regain equilibrium. This flow drives a phase of slow weak

systems that include a hot Jupiter, these two systems with a hot Jupiter have a
long-period planet located at only $\sim$1 au from their host star. WASP-41 is
a rather young star known to be chromospherically active. To differentiate its
magnetic cycle from the radial velocity effect induced by the second planet, we
used the emission in the H$\alpha$ line and find this indicator well suited to
detecting the stellar activity pattern and the magnetic cycle. The analysis of
the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect induced by WASP-41 b suggests that the planet
could be misaligned, though an aligned orbit cannot be excluded. WASP-47 has
recently been found to host two additional transiting super Earths. With such
an unprecedented architecture, the WASP-47 system will be very important for
understanding planetary migration.

sublinear in the number of observations as we compute all moments through a
single operation. Furthermore, that operation can be done offline. The
simulations show that the method is unbiased for all practical purposes for any
sampling design, including random sampling, and that the computational cost is
comparable (actually faster for moderate and large data sets) to the simple,

necessary to employ sophisticated image processing algorithms to translate

X-ray Observatory, followed by an examination of the specific challenges posed

has been studied extensively in the literature. Though many clustering
algorithms have been proposed, clustering theories that justify the use of
these clustering algorithms are still unsatisfactory. In particular, one of the
fundamental challenges is to address the following question:
  What is a cluster in a set of data points?
  In this paper, we make an attempt to address such a question by considering a
set of data points associated with a distance measure (metric). We first
propose a new cohesion measure in terms of the distance measure. Using the
cohesion measure, we define a cluster as a set of points that are cohesive to
themselves. For such a definition, we show there are various equivalent
statements that have intuitive explanations. We then consider the second
question:
  How do we find clusters and good partitions of clusters under such a
definition?
  For such a question, we propose a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm and a
partitional algorithm. Unlike standard hierarchical agglomerative algorithms,
our hierarchical agglomerative algorithm has a specific stopping criterion and
it stops with a partition of clusters. Our partitional algorithm, called the
K-sets algorithm in the paper, appears to be a new iterative algorithm. Unlike
the Lloyd iteration that needs two-step minimization, our K-sets algorithm only
takes one-step minimization.
  One of the most interesting findings of our paper is the duality result
between a distance measure and a cohesion measure. Such a duality result leads
to a dual K-sets algorithm for clustering a set of data points with a cohesion
measure. The dual K-sets algorithm converges in the same way as a sequential
version of the classical kernel K-means algorithm. The key difference is that a
cohesion measure does not need to be positive semi-definite.

involving the digital plane in recent times, several interesting works related
with the Farey sequence have come up. Our work is related with the problem of
searching an arbitrary fraction in a Farey sequence and its relevance to image
processing. Given an arbitrary fraction p/q (0 < p < q) and a Farey sequence Fn
of order n, we propose a novel algorithm using the Regula Falsi method and the
concept of Farey table to efficiently find the fraction of Fn closest to p/q.
All computations are in the integer domain only, which is its added benefit.
Some contemporary applications of image processing have also been shown where
such concepts can be incorporated. Experimental results have been furnished to
demonstrate its efficiency and elegance.

engaged 83 human annotators to label over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European

of the annotated tweets contain emojis. The sentiment analysis of the emojis
allows us to draw several interesting conclusions. It turns out that most of
the emojis are positive, especially the most popular ones. The sentiment
distribution of the tweets with and without emojis is significantly different.
The inter-annotator agreement on the tweets with emojis is higher. Emojis tend
to occur at the end of the tweets, and their sentiment polarity increases with
the distance. We observe no significant differences in the emoji rankings
between the 13 languages and the Emoji Sentiment Ranking. Consequently, we
propose our Emoji Sentiment Ranking as a European language-independent resource
for automated sentiment analysis. Finally, the paper provides a formalization
of sentiment and a novel visualization in the form of a sentiment bar.

starbursts. We analyze the mid-IR properties of the nucleus (central 150 pc)
and four regions of the bright circumnuclear (diameter~600 pc) star-forming
(SF) ring of this object. The nucleus differs from the circumnuclear SF ring by
having a strong 8-12 micron continuum (low 11.3 micron PAH equivalent width).
These characteristics, together with the nuclear X-ray and sub-mm properties,
can be explained by an X-ray weak active galactic nucleus (AGN), or by peculiar
SF with a short molecular gas depletion time and producing an enhanced
radiation field density. In either case, the nuclear luminosity (L(IR) < 6e43
erg/s) is only <5% of the total bolometric luminosity of NGC1614. So this
possible AGN does not dominate the energy output in this object. We also
compare three star-formation rate (SFR) tracers (Pa$\alpha$, 11.3 micron PAH,
and 24 micron emissions) at 150 pc scales in the circumnuclear ring. In
general, we find that the SFR is underestimated (overestimated) by a factor of
2-4 (2-3) using the 11.3 micron PAH (24 micron) emission with respect to the
extinction corrected Pa$\alpha$ SFR. The former can be explained because we do
not include diffuse PAH emission in our measurements, while the latter might
indicate that the dust temperature is particularly warmer in the central

whether a specific system has a ground state at zero energy, i.e.\ whether its
Hamiltonian is frustration free. Frustration-free Hamiltonians, in turn, play a
central role for constructing and understanding new phases of matter in quantum
many-body physics. Unfortunately, determining whether this is the case is known
to be a complexity-theoretically intractable problem. This makes it highly
desirable to search for efficient heuristics and algorithms in order to, at
least, partially answer this question. Here we prove a general criterion - a
sufficient condition - under which a local Hamiltonian is guaranteed to be
frustration free by lifting Shearer's theorem from classical probability theory
to the quantum world. Remarkably, evaluating this condition proceeds via a
fully classical analysis of a hard-core lattice gas at negative fugacity on the
Hamiltonian's interaction graph which, as a statistical mechanics problem, is
of interest in its own right. We concretely apply this criterion to local
Hamiltonians on various regular lattices, while bringing to bear the tools of
spin glass physics which permit us to obtain new bounds on the SAT/UNSAT
transition in random quantum satisfiability. These also lead us to natural
conjectures for when such bounds will be tight, as well as to a novel notion of
universality for these computer science problems. Besides providing concrete
algorithms leading to detailed and quantitative insights, this underscores the
power of marrying classical statistical mechanics with quantum computation and
complexity theory.

grows exponentially with the system size. We derive their dimension and those
of the centraliser by both combinatorial and algebraic techniques. A mapping
onto a field theory permits us to identify the conformal field theory governing

errors, using a least squares criterion (LS-FPP). Their performance is measured
against state-of-the-art algorithms and the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB), which is
also derived here. Simulations show that LS-FPP outperforms the state-of-art
and operates close to the CRB. Compact CRB expressions, properties, and
insights are obtained by explicitly computing the CRB in various special cases
-- including when the signal of interest admits a sparse parametrization, using
harmonic retrieval as an example.

coordinate Electric Vehicles (EV) charging in order to contribute to the
voltage control on a residential electrical distribution feeder. This aims to
maintain the voltage level in function of the EV's power injection using the
sensitivity matrix approach. The decentralized optimization is tested with two
different methods, respectively global and local, when EV take into account
their impact on all the nodes of the network or only on a local neighborhood of
their connection point. EV can also update their decisions asynchronously or
synchronously. While only the global approach with asynchronous update is
theoretically proven to converge, using results from game theory, simulations
show the potential of other algorithms for which fewer iterations or fewer
informations are necessary. Finally, using Monte Carlo simulations over a wide
range of EV localization configurations, the first analysis have also shown a
promising performance in comparison with uncoordinated charging or with a
""voltage droop charging control"" recently proposed in the literature.

electromagnetic field as a local gauge field of a restricted group of synchrony
transformations. We begin by arguing that the inability to measure the one-way
speed of light independent of a synchronization scheme necessitates that
physical laws must be reformulated without distant simultaneity. As a result,
we are forced to introduce a new operational definition of time which leads to
a fundamental space-time invariance principle that is related to a subset of
the synchrony group. We identify the gauge field associated with this new
invariance principle with the electromagnetic field. Consequently, the
electromagnetic field acquires a space-time interpretation, as suggested in our
previous work. In addition, we investigate the static, spherically symmetric
solution of the resulting field equations. Also, we discuss implications of the
present work for understanding the tension between classical and quantum
theory.

coarse-grain inviscid, incompressible fluid dynamics in two dimensions. In this
reduction the spectrally-truncated vorticity equation defines the
microdynamics, while the macroscopic state space consists of quasi-equilibrium
trial probability densities on the microscopic phase space, which are
parameterized by the means and variances of the low modes of the vorticity. A
macroscopic path therefore represents a coarse-grained approximation to the
evolution of a nonequilibrium ensemble of microscopic solutions. Closure in
terms of the vector of resolved variables, namely, the means and variances of
the low modes, is achieved by minimizing over all feasible paths the time
integral of their mean-squared residual with respect to the Liouville equation.
The equations governing the optimal path are deduced from Hamilton-Jacobi
theory. The coarse-grained dynamics derived by this optimization technique
contains a scale-dependent eddy viscosity, modified nonlinear interactions
between the low mode means, and a nonlinear coupling between the mean and
variance of each low mode. The predictive skill of this optimal closure is
validated quantitatively by comparing it against direct numerical simulations.
These tests show that good agreement is achieved without adjusting any closure
parameters.

a key regulator influencing the proliferative and migrative potentials of
species. Spatial and temporal disturbances lead to adverse and hazardous
microenvironments for cellular systems that is reflected in the phenotypic
heterogeneity within the system. In this paper, we study the effect of
microenvironment on the invasive capability of species, or mutants, on
structured grids under the influence of site-dependent random proliferation in
addition to a migration potential. We discuss both continuous and discrete
fitness distributions. Our results suggest that the invasion probability is
negatively correlated with the variance of fitness distribution of mutants (for
both advantageous and neutral mutants) in the absence of migration of both
types of cells. A similar behaviour is observed even in the presence of a
random fitness distribution of host cells in the system with neutral fitness
rate. In the case of a bimodal distribution, we observe zero invasion
probability until the system reaches a (specific) proportion of advantageous
phenotypes. Also, we find that the migrative potential amplifies the invasion
probability as the variance of fitness of mutants increases in the system,
which is the exact opposite in the absence of migration. Our computational
framework captures the harsh microenvironmental conditions through quenched
random fitness distributions and migration of cells, and our analysis shows
that they play an important role in the invasion dynamics of several biological
systems such as bacterial micro-habitats, epithelial dysplasia, and metastasis.
We believe that our results may lead to more experimental studies, which can in
turn provide further insights into the role and impact of heterogeneous
environments on invasion dynamics.

second order linear difference equations with constant coefficients. So, any
second order linear difference equations with quasi-periodic coefficients is
essentially equivalent to a Chebyshev equation, whose parameter only depends on
the values of the quasi-periodic coefficients and can be determined by a
non-linear recurrence. Moreover, we solve this recurrence and obtaining a
closed expression for this parameter. As a by-product we also obtain a
Floquet's type result; that is, the necessary and sufficient condition for the

various environmental conditions, and in particular, on flow rates. Modeling
the evolution of such properties is difficult both at the porescale where the
phase morphology can be distinguished, as well as during upscaling to the
corescale effective properties. Experimental data on biofilm growth is also
limited because its collection can interfere with the growth, while imaging
itself presents challenges.
  In this paper we combine insight from imaging, experiments, and numerical
simulations and visualization. The experimental dataset is based on glass beads
domain inoculated by biomass which is subjected to various flow conditions
promoting the growth of biomass and the appearance of a biofilm phase. The
domain is imaged and the imaging data is used directly by a computational model
for flow and transport. The results of the computational flow model are
upscaled to produce conductivities which compare well with the experimentally
obtained hydraulic properties of the medium. The flow model is also coupled to
a newly developed biomass--nutrient growth model, and the model reproduces
morphologies qualitatively similar to those observed in the experiment.

regarding information security management, is based mainly on management
controls based on standards such as ISO / IEC 27001: 2015, resulting in the
production of especially technical analysis reports, rather than a
socio-technical approach. This leads to the perception by the customer of the
delivery of a product instead of a service.The product concerned is reduced to
a set of prescriptions, sometimes unrelated, which materialize in a descriptive
and static view of client security management. As a result, the client can
hardly use the product continuously, following the dynamics of changes in their
organization, therefore recognizing value in the provision made by the
supplier. The use of the paradigm Service Dominant Logic (LDS), in the
development of a range of security management information, helps to change the
focus of tangible resources to the intangible assets. The aspects of
tangibility, materialized in a document that describes the client's
vulnerabilities and attack vectors are referred to a secondary level, given the
importance of the intangible aspects, such as the interaction that is
established between the customer specialists and supplier. In this article we
propose to analyze in the perspective of a socio-technical theory, the Activity
Theory, the service provided by an artifact called 27001 Manager, designed to
assist the entire cycle of analysis, development and maintenance of an
information security management system (ISMS). The analysis aims at observing
the existing interaction between customer / supplier, considering that the
service is inherently dynamic and inter-subjective, ie the result of a
compromise between the customer and the supplier.

the Unified Growth Theory is an outstanding example of such common

are contradicted by the data used in its formulation. The postulated three
regimes of growth did not exist and there was no takeoff at any time. It is
demonstrated that features interpreted as three regimes of growth represent
just mathematical properties of a single, monotonically-increasing
distribution, indicating that a single mechanism should be used to explain the
historical economic growth. It is shown that using different socio-economic
conditions for different perceived parts of the historical GDP/cap data is
irrelevant and scientifically unjustified. The GDP/cap growth was indeed
increasing slowly over a long time and fast over a short time but these
features represent a single, uniform and uninterrupted growth process, which
should be interpreted as whole using a single mechanism of growth.
