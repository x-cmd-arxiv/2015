  invasions",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reaction-diffusion analytical modeling of predator-prey systems has shown
that specialist natural enemies can slow, stop and even reverse pest invasions,
assuming that the prey population displays a strong Allee effect in its growth.
Few additional analytical results have been obtained for other spatially
distributed predator-prey systems, as traveling waves of non-monotonous systems
are notoriously difficult to obtain. Traveling waves have indeed recently been
shown to exist in predator-prey systems, but the direction of the wave, an
essential item of information in the context of the control of biological
invasions, is generally unknown. Preliminary numerical explorations have hinted
that control by generalist predators might be possible for prey populations
displaying logistic growth. We aimed to formalize the conditions in which
spatial biological control can be achieved by generalists, through an
analytical approach based on reaction-diffusion equations. The population of
the focal prey - the invader - is assumed to grow according to a logistic
function. The predator has a type II functional response and is present
everywhere in the domain, at its carrying capacity, on alternative hosts.
Control, defined as the invader becoming extinct in the domain, may result from
spatially independent demographic dynamics or from a spatial extinction wave.
Using comparison principles, we obtain sufficient conditions for control and
for invasion, based on scalar bistable partial differential equations (PDEs).
The searching efficiency and functional response plateau of the predator are
identified as the main parameters defining the parameter space for prey
extinction and invasion. Numerical explorations are carried out in the region
of those control parameters space between the super-and subso-lutions, in which
no conclusion about controllability can be drawn on the basis of analytical
solutions. The ability of generalist predators to control prey populations with
logistic growth lies in the bis-table dynamics of the coupled system, rather
than in the bistability of prey-only dynamics as observed for specialist
predators attacking prey populations displaying Allee effects. The
consideration of space in predator-prey systems involving generalist predators
with a parabolic functional response is crucial. Analysis of the ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) system identifies parameter regions with
monostable (extinction) and bistable (extinction or invasion) dynamics. By
contrast, analysis of the associated PDE system distinguishes different and
additional regions of invasion and extinction. Depending on the relative
positions of these different zones, four patterns of spatial dynamics can be
identified : traveling waves of extinction and invasion, pulse waves of
extinction and heterogeneous stationary positive solutions of the Turing type.
As a consequence, prey control is predicted to be possible when space is
considered in additional situations other than those identified without
considering space. The reverse situation is also possible. None of these
considerations apply to spatial predator-prey systems with specialist natural
enemies.

tilted at ~30 degrees to the rotation axis. They are significantly weaker than
the field of GQ Lup, an accreting classical T Tauri star (cTTS) with similar
mass and age which can be used to compare the magnetic properties of wTTSs and

0.033 and 0.104 km/s for V819 Tau and V830 Tau respectively. RV residuals

thermodynamics of bipartite systems, which allows for the definition of an
efficiency that relates the rate with which the sensor learns about the signal

entropy production. We demonstrate a general tradeoff between sensory capacity

exhibited by Bogoliubov-Goldstone degrees of freedom of a quantum-critical

that the infinite-N limit of Bogoliubov-Goldstone modes of critical graviton

Subsampling is one of efficient strategies to handle this problem. In previous

kind of SSWR, poisson subsampling (PSS), for fast algorithm in ordinary

between computation cost and approximation efficiency. Besides the
non-asymptotic result, we provide asymptotic consistency and normality of the
subsample estimator. Methodologically, we propose a two-step subsampling
algorithm, which is efficient with respect to a statistical objective and
independent on the linear model assumption.. Synthetic and real data are used
to empirically study our proposed subsampling strategies. We argue by these
empirical studies that, (1) our proposed two-step algorithm has obvious
advantage when the assumed linear model does not accurate, and (2) the PSS

driven-dissipative nonlinear photonic resonators. In the regime where the
semiclassical mean-field theory predicts bistability, the exact steady-state
density matrix is known to be unique, being a statistical mixture of two
states: in particular, no static hysteresis cycle of the excited population
occurs as a function of the driving intensity. Here, we predict that in the
quantum regime a dynamic hysteresis with a rich phenomenology does appear when
sweeping the driving amplitude in a finite time. The hysteresis area as a
function of the sweep time reveals a double power-law decay, with a behavior
qualitatively different from the mean-field predictions. The dynamic hysteresis
power-law in the slow sweep limit defines a characteristic time, which depends
dramatically on the size of the nonlinearity and on the frequency detuning
between the driving and the resonator. In the strong nonlinearity regime, the
characteristic time oscillates as a function of the intrinsic system parameters
due to multiphotonic resonances. We show that the dynamic hysteresis for the
considered class of driven-dissipative systems is due to a non-adiabatic
response region with connections to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for quenched
phase transitions. We also consider the case of two coupled driven-dissipative
nonlinear resonators, showing that dynamic hysteresis and power-law behavior
occur also in presence of correlations between resonators. Our theoretical
predictions can be explored in a broad variety of physical systems, e.g.,
circuit QED superconducting resonators and semiconductor optical microcavities.

the various Lagrangian and Standard Perturbation Theories (LPT and SPT). We
first look at it in the context of one dimensional (1-d) dynamics, where 1LPT
is exact at the perturbative level and one can exactly resum the SPT series
into the 1LPT power spectrum. Shell crossings lead to non-perturbative effects,
and the PT ignorance can be quantified in terms of their ratio, which is also
the transfer function squared in the absence of stochasticity. At the order of
PT we work, this parametrization is equivalent to the results of effective
field theory (EFT), and can thus be expanded in terms of the same parameters.
We find that its radius of convergence is larger than the SPT loop expansion.
The same EFT parametrization applies to all SPT loop terms and, if
stochasticity can be ignored, to all N-point correlators. In 3-d, the LPT
structure is considerably more complicated, and we find that LPT models with
parametrization motivated by the EFT exhibit running with $k$ and that SPT is
generally a better choice. Since these transfer function expansions contain
free parameters that change with cosmological model their usefulness for

oscillations, including string monodromy models, for which we ran a series of

The data was taken with the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) on the Canary

of the time series jets were seen along the whole length of the intruding

In the framework of earlier studies, the observed transient $\lambda$ shape of

families of compact stars: hadronic stars and quark stars. Besides the well
known hyperon puzzle of the physics of compact stars, a similar puzzle exists
also when considering delta resonances. We show that these particles appear at
densities close to twice saturation density and must be therefore included in
the calculations of the hadronic equation of state. Such an early appearance is
strictly related to the value of the L parameter of the symmetry energy that
has been found, in recent phenomenological studies, to lie in the range
$40<L<62$ MeV. We discuss also the threshold for the formation of deltas and
hyperons for hot and lepton rich hadronic matter. Similarly to the case of
hyperons, also delta resonances cause a softening of the equation of state
which makes it difficult to obtain massive hadronic stars. Quark stars, on the
other hand, can reach masses up to $2.75 M_{\odot}$ as predicted by
perturbative QCD calculations. We then discuss the observational constraints on
the masses and the radii of compact stars. The tension between the precise
measurements of high masses and the indications of the existence of very
compact stellar objects (with radii of the order of $10$ km) is relieved when
assuming that very massive compact stars are quark stars and very compact stars
are hadronic stars. Finally, we discuss recent interesting measurements of the
eccentricities of the orbits of millisecond pulsars in low mass X-ray binaries.
The high values of the eccentricities found in some cases could be explained by
assuming that the hadronic star, initially present in the binary system,
converts to a quark star due to the increase of its central density.

central region of the star converts into quark matter and the process of
conversion is accelerated by the existence of strong hydrodynamical
instabilities, and a second phase, lasting about ten seconds, during which the
process of conversion proceeds till the surface of the star via production and
diffusion of strangeness. We will show that these two steps play a crucial role

implications of this scenario both for long and for short Gamma Ray Bursts,

will show that the process of quark deconfinement can be connected to specific
observed features of the GRBs. In the case of long GRBs we will discuss the
possibility that quark deconfinement is at the origin of the second peak

Counting is a fundamental task in distributed computing since knowing the size

problems. Currently, the best upper bound proved on the running time to compute
the exact network size is double-exponential. However, only linear complexity
lower bounds are known, leaving open the question of whether efficient Counting

significant step towards answering this question by presenting a distributed

complexity. Our algorithm ensures that eventually every node knows the exact
size of the system and stops executing the algorithm. Previous Counting
protocols have either double-exponential time complexity, or they are
exponential but do not terminate, or terminate but do not provide running-time
guarantees, or guarantee only an exponential upper bound on the network size.
Other protocols are heuristic and do not guarantee the correct count.

dichalcogenides (TMDs), acquire significant electric polarization normal to the

linear coupling of electrons to electric fields normal to the layers.
Irradiation at oblique incidence at frequencies above the gap causes interband
transitions due to coupling to both normal and in-plane ac electric fields. The
interference between the two processes leads to sizable in-plane photocurrents
and valley currents. The direction and magnitude of currents is controlled by
light polarization and is determined by its helical or non-helical components.
The helicity-dependent ballistic current arises due to asymmetric
photogeneration. The non-helical current has a ballistic contribution (dominant
in sufficiently clean samples) caused by asymmetric scattering of photoexcited
carriers, and a side-jump contribution. Magneto-induced photocurrent is due to
the Lorentz force or due to intrinsic magnetic moment related to Berry

increasingly deployed within cars to support new functionalities. Traffic
generated by these sensors congest traditional intra-car networks, such as CAN
buses. Furthermore, the large amount of wires needed to connect sensors makes
it harder to design cars in a modular way. To alleviate these limitations, we
propose, simulate, and implement a hybrid wired/wireless architecture, in which
each node is connected to either a wired interface or a wireless interface or
both. Specifically, we propose a new protocol, called Hybrid-Backpressure
Collection Protocol (Hybrid-BCP), to efficiently collect data from sensors in
intra-car networks. Hybrid-BCP is backward-compatible with the CAN bus
technology, and builds on the BCP protocol, designed for wireless sensor
networks. Hybrid-BCP achieves high throughput and shows resilience to dynamic
network conditions, including adversarial interferences. Our testbed
implementation, based on CAN and ZigBee transceivers, demonstrates the load
balancing and routing functionalities of Hybrid-BCP and its resilience to DoS
attacks. We further provide simulation results, obtained with the ns-3
simulator and based on real intra-car RSSI traces, that compare between the
performance of Hybrid-BCP and a tree-based collection protocol. Notably, the
simulations show that Hybrid-BCP can achieve the same performance as the
tree-based protocol while reducing the radio transmission power by a factor of
10.

as wheel encoders had so far difficulted the implementation of an accurate

improve motion control in the GNBot by incorporating a gyroscope whilst
maintaining the requisite of no wheel encoders. Among the problems that have

the infrared rangefinder on board each robot, greatly simplifying the

used a single epoch of reionization (EoR) model, our approach samples a large
parameter space of EoR models: the dominant uncertainty when estimating
constraints on $T_{\rm S}$. Allowing $T_{\rm S}$ to be a free parameter and
marginalizing over EoR parameters in our Markov Chain Monte Carlo code 21CMMC,
we infer $T_{\rm S}\ge3 {\rm K}$ (corresponding approximately to $1\sigma$) for
a mean IGM neutral fraction of $\bar{x}_{\rm H{\scriptsize I}}\gtrsim0.1$. We
further improve on these limits by folding-in additional EoR constraints based
on: (i) the dark fraction in QSO spectra, which implies a strict upper limit of
$\bar{x}_{\rm H{\scriptsize I}}[z=5.9]\leq 0.06+0.05 \,(1\sigma)$; and (ii) the
electron scattering optical depth, $\tau_{\rm e}=0.066\pm0.016\,(1\sigma)$
measured by the Planck satellite. By restricting the allowed EoR models, these
additional observations tighten the approximate $1\sigma$ lower limits on the
spin temperature to $T_{\rm S} \ge 6$ K. Thus, even such preliminary 21-cm
observations begin to rule out extreme scenarios such as `cold reionization',
implying at least some prior heating of the IGM. The analysis framework
developed here can be applied to upcoming 21-cm observations, thereby providing
unique insights into the sources which heated and subsequently reionized the

assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. This comparison of X-ray and lensing
masses provides a measurement of the combined bias of X-ray hydrostatic masses
due to both astrophysical and instrumental sources. Assuming a fixed cosmology,
and within a characteristic radius (r_2500) determined from the X-ray data, we
measure a lensing to X-ray mass ratio of 0.96 +/- 9% (stat) +/- 9% (sys). We
find no significant trends of this ratio with mass, redshift or the
morphological indicators used to select the sample. In accordance with
predictions from hydro simulations for the most massive, relaxed clusters, our
results disfavor strong, tens-of-percent departures from hydrostatic
equilibrium at these radii. In addition, we find a mean concentration of the
sample measured from lensing data of c_200 = $3.0_{-1.8}^{+4.4}$. Anticipated
short-term improvements in lensing systematics, and a modest expansion of the

(GCs). In the model, populations of stellar clusters form in the high-pressure
discs of high-redshift ($z>2$) galaxies (a rapid-disruption phase due to tidal
perturbations from the dense interstellar medium), after which the galaxy
mergers associated with hierarchical galaxy formation redistribute the
surviving, massive clusters into the galaxy haloes, where they remain until the
present day (a slow-disruption phase due to tidal evaporation). The high galaxy
merger rates of $z>2$ galaxies allow these clusters to be `liberated' into the
galaxy haloes before they are disrupted within the high-density discs. This
physically-motivated toy model is the first to include the rapid-disruption
phase, which is shown to be essential for simultaneously reproducing the wide
variety of properties of observed GC systems, such as their universal
characteristic mass-scale, the dependence of the specific frequency on
metallicity and galaxy mass, the GC system mass-halo mass relation, the
constant number of GCs per unit supermassive black hole mass, and the colour
bimodality of GC systems. The model predicts that most of these observables
were already in place at $z=1$-$2$, although under rare circumstances GCs may
still form in present-day galaxies. In addition, the model provides important
constraints on models for multiple stellar populations in GCs by putting limits
on initial GC masses and the amount of pristine gas accretion. The paper is
concluded with a discussion of these and several other predictions and
implications, as well as the main open questions in the field.

Galactic halos in the simulation have significantly different properties from
those assumed in the ""standard halo model"" often used in dark matter detection
studies. The formation of the galaxy causes a contraction of the dark matter
halo, whose density profile develops a steeper slope than the
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile between $r\approx1.5$ kpc and $r\approx10$
kpc. At smaller radii, $r\lesssim1.5$ kpc, the halos develop a flatter than NFW
slope. This unexpected feature may be specific to our particular choice of
subgrid physics model but nevertheless the dark matter density profiles agree
within 30% as the mass resolution is increased by a factor 150. The inner
regions of the halos are almost perfectly spherical (axis ratios $b/a > 0.97$
within $r=1$ kpc) and there is no offset larger than 45 pc between the centre
of the stellar distribution and the centre of the dark halo. The morphology of
the predicted dark matter annihilation radiation signal is in broad agreement
with $\gamma$-ray observations at large Galactic latitudes ($b\gtrsim3^\circ$).

to contamination of the 4.5-micron band by the dominant Halpha line, while the
3.6-micron filter is free of nebular emission lines. We take advantage of new

confidently in the redshift range z=5.1-5.4 based on the photometric redshift

0.31+/-0.05 mag and 0.35+/-0.07 mag, implying a rest-frame equivalent width
EW(Halpha+[NII]+[SII]) of 665+/-53 Angstroms and 707+/-74 Angstroms,
respectively, for sources in these samples. These values are consistent albeit
slightly higher than derived by Stark+2013 at z~4, suggesting an evolution to
higher values of the Halpha+[NII]+[SII] EW at z>2. Using the 3.6micron band,
which is free of emission line contamination, we perform robust SED fitting and
find a median specific star formation rate of sSFR = 17_{-5}^{+2} Gyr^{-1},
7_{-2}^{+1}x higher than at z~2. We find no strong correlation (<2sigma)

of a spinning neutron star to linear order in the angular momentum. The spin of
the object introduces couplings between electric and magnetic distortions and
new classes of spin-induced (""rotational"") tidal Love numbers emerge. We focus
on stationary tidal fields, which induce axisymmetric perturbations. We present
the perturbation equations for both electric-led and magnetic-led rotational
Love numbers for generic multipoles and explicitly solve them for various
tabulated equations of state and for a tidal field with an electric (even
parity) and magnetic (odd parity) component with $\ell=2,3,4$. For a binary
system close to the merger, various components of the tidal field become
relevant. In this case we find that an octupolar magnetic tidal field can
significantly modify the mass quadrupole moment of a neutron star. Preliminary
estimates, assuming a spin parameter $\chi\approx0.05$, show modifications
$\gtrsim10\%$ relative to the static case, at an orbital distance of five
stellar radii. Furthermore, the rotational Love numbers as functions of the
moment of inertia are much more sensitive to the equation of state than in the
static case, where approximate universal relations at the percent level exist.
For a neutron-star binary approaching the merger, we estimate that the
approximate universality of the induced mass quadrupole moment deteriorates
from $1\%$ in the static case to roughly $6\%$ when $\chi\approx0.05$. Our
results suggest that spin-tidal couplings can introduce important corrections
to the gravitational waveforms of spinning neutron-star binaries approaching

those of transition disks (little-to-no warm dust observed). For each best-fit
model, we estimate inner and outer disk emission boundaries (r$_{in}$ and

each disk, and we examine correlations between these and several observational

consequence of orbital precession. We observed 28 fading events spread over
several years, and did not see the expected changes. Instead we found that the
fading events are not strictly periodic. Second, we attempted to detect the
planet's radiation, based on infrared observations spanning the predicted times
of occultations. We ruled out a signal of the expected amplitude. Third, we
attempted to detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect by performing
high-resolution spectroscopy throughout a fading event. No effect was seen at

deform into a Fermi pocket, similar to {{the surface states of a topological

lower bounds for the secrecy capacity of compound finite-state memoryless
channels under discrete alphabets are extended to arbitrary uncertainty sets
and continuous alphabets under the strong secrecy criterion. The conditions
under which these bounds are tight are given. Under the saddle-point condition,
the compound secrecy capacity is shown to be equal to that of the worst-case
channel. Based on this, the compound Gaussian MIMO wiretap channel is studied
under the spectral norm constraint and without the degradedness assumption.
First, it is assumed that only the eavesdropper channel is unknown, but is
known to have a bounded spectral norm (maximum channel gain). The compound
secrecy capacity is established in a closed form and the optimal signaling is
identified: the compound capacity equals the worst-case channel capacity thus
establishing the saddle-point property; the optimal signaling is Gaussian and
on the eigenvectors of the legitimate channel and the worst-case eavesdropper
is isotropic. The eigenmode power allocation somewhat resembles the standard
water-filling but is not identical to it. More general uncertainty sets are
considered and the existence of a maximum element is shown to be sufficient for
a saddle-point to exist, so that signaling on the worst-case channel achieves
the compound capacity of the whole class of channels. The case of
rank-constrained eavesdropper is considered and the respective compound secrecy
capacity is established. Subsequently, the case of additive uncertainty in the
legitimate channel, in addition to the unknown eavesdropper channel, is
studied. Its compound secrecy capacity and the optimal signaling are
established in a closed-form as well, revealing the same saddle-point property.

activity is 48 \% in the paired galaxies with emission lines and 40\% for the

isolated galaxies). These results remain after dissecting the effects of
morphological type and galactic stellar mass (with only a small, non
significant, enhancement of the AGN fraction in pairs of objects). These
results suggest that weak interactions are not necessary or sufficient to
trigger low-luminosity AGN. Since the fraction of AGN is predominant in early
type spiral galaxies, we conclude that the role of a bulge, and a large gas
reservoir are both essential for the triggering of nuclear activity. The most
striking result is that type 1 galaxies are almost absent from the AGN sample.
This result is in conflict with the Unified Model, and suggests that high

It is shown that for sufficiently small initial jumps the nematic DSW is

reconnection. While the emission from internal shocks has been extensively
studied, that from reconnection still has few quantitative predictions. We
study the expected prompt-GRB emission from magnetic reconnection and compare
its temporal and spectral properties to observations. The main difference from
internal shocks is that for reconnection one expects relativistic bulk motions
with Lorentz factors $\Gamma'\gtrsim\;$a few in the jet's bulk frame. We
consider such motions of the emitting material in two anti-parallel directions
(e.g. of the reconnecting magnetic-field lines) within an ultra-relativistic
(with $\Gamma\gg1$) thin spherical reconnection layer. The emission's
relativistic beaming in the jet's frame greatly affects the light-curves. For
emission at radii $R_0<R<R_0+\Delta{}R$ (with $\Gamma=\rm{const}$) the observed
pulse width is $\Delta{}T\sim(R_0/2c\Gamma^2)\max(1/\Gamma',\,\Delta{}R/R_0)$,
i.e. up to $\sim\Gamma'$ times shorter than for isotropic emission in the jet's

steady-state with continuous plasma flow into and out of the reconnection
layer, and sporadic reconnection in relativistic turbulence that produces
relativistic plasmoids. Both of these modes can account for many observed
prompt-GRB properties: variability, pulse asymmetry, the very rapid declines at
their end, and pulse evolutions that are either hard to soft (for
$\Gamma'\lesssim2$) or intensity tracking (for $\Gamma'>2$). However, the
relativistic turbulence mode is more likely to be relevant for the prompt
sub-MeV emission and can naturally account also for the peak

combine the variations brought by the unknown incident spectrum and mass
attenuation into a single unknown mass-attenuation spectrum function; the
resulting measurement equation has the Laplace integral form. The

functions. We derive a block coordinate-descent algorithm for constrained
minimization of a penalized negative log-likelihood (NLL) cost function, where
penalty terms ensure nonnegativity of the spline coefficients and nonnegativity
and sparsity of the density map. The image sparsity is imposed using
total-variation (TV) and $\ell_1$ norms, applied to the density-map image and
its discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients, respectively. This algorithm
alternates between Nesterov's proximal-gradient (NPG) and limited-memory
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno with box constraints (L-BFGS-B) steps for
updating the image and mass-attenuation spectrum parameters. To accelerate
convergence of the density-map NPG step, we apply a step-size selection scheme

lognormal and Poisson noise models and establish conditions for biconvexity of
the corresponding NLLs. We also prove the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property of

representation of the solution to the nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman

FBSDEs can then be simulated by employing linear regression techniques. To
enhance the efficiency of the proposed scheme when treating more complex

clustering measurements (whether they are for BAO only or marginalized over
RSD), which indicates that as the analysis of galaxy clustering data becomes
more accurate and robust, the systematic uncertainties are reduced. On the
other hand, we find that flux-averaging SNe Ia at z>= 0.5 significantly
tightens the dark energy constraints, and excludes a flat universe with a
cosmological constant at 68% confidence level, assuming a dark energy equation
of state linear in the cosmic scale factor. Flux-averaging has the most
significant effect when we allow dark energy density function X(z) to be a free

derive a spectral representation for the associated rate functions.
Interestingly, in both phases both rate functions exhibit \emph{flat pieces},

large deviation. The large deviation principles lead to laws of large numbers
and central limit theorems. We identify the scaling behavior of the critical
curve for small and large charge bias and also the scaling behavior of the free
energy for small charge bias and small inverse temperature. Both are linked to

increasingly attractive, because huge quantities of speech data are becoming
available but manual annotations remain hard to acquire. In this paper, we
propose an approach for unsupervised discovery of linguistic structure for the
target spoken language given raw speech data. This linguistic structure
includes two-level (subword-like and word-like) acoustic patterns, the lexicon
of word-like patterns in terms of subword-like patterns and the N-gram language
model based on word-like patterns. All patterns, models, and parameters can be
automatically learned from the unlabelled speech corpus. This is achieved by an
initialization step followed by three cascaded stages for acoustic, linguistic,
and lexical iterative optimization. The lexicon of word-like patterns defines
allowed consecutive sequence of HMMs for subword-like patterns. In each
iteration, model training and decoding produces updated labels from which the
lexicon and HMMs can be further updated. In this way, model parameters and
decoded labels are respectively optimized in each iteration, and the knowledge
about the linguistic structure is learned gradually layer after layer. The
proposed approach was tested in preliminary experiments on a corpus of Mandarin
broadcast news, including a task of spoken term detection with performance
compared to a parallel test using models trained in a supervised way. Results
show that the proposed system not only yields reasonable performance on its
own, but is also complimentary to existing large vocabulary ASR systems.

predict the AMS-02 observables we use propagation parameters extracted from
observed fluxes of heavier nuclei and the low energy part of the AMS-02 data.
We assume that the dark matter particle is a Majorana fermion coupling to third
generation fermions via a spin-0 mediator, and annihilating to multiple
channels at once. The simultaneous presence of various annihilation channels
provides the dark matter model with additional flexibility, and this enables us
to simultaneously fit all cosmic ray spectra using a simple particle physics
model and coherent astrophysical assumptions. Our results indicate that AMS-02
observations are not only consistent with the dark matter hypothesis within the
uncertainties, but adding a dark matter contribution improves the fit to the

element of the constituent quarks and a strong interaction parameter related to
the overlap of the quark and antiquark wave-functions in the meson, called the
decay constant $f_P$. The leptonic decay constants for $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$,
$D^{\pm}$, $D_s^\pm$, and $B^\pm$ mesons can be obtained with controlled
theoretical uncertainties and high precision from {\it ab initio} lattice-QCD

and theoretical decay-constant calculations enables the determination of
several elements of the CKM matrix within the standard model. These
determinations are competitive with those obtained from semileptonic decays,
and also complementary because they are sensitive to different quark
flavor-changing currents. They can also be used to test the unitarity of the
first and second rows of the CKM matrix. Conversely, taking the CKM elements
predicted by unitarity, one can infer ""experimental"" values for $f_P$ that can
be compared with theory. These provide tests of lattice-QCD methods, provided

approach to indistinguishable particles is described, and is used to analyze

and split across subsequent operations with the table. The rehashing operation
uses bucket-level synchronization only and therefore allows a race condition
between lookup and moving operations running in different threads. Instead of
using explicit synchronization, the algorithm detects the race condition and
restarts the lookup operation. In comparison with other lock-based algorithms,
the proposed algorithm reduces high-level synchronization on the hot path,
improving performance, concurrency, and scalability of the table. The response
time of the operations is also more predictable. The algorithm is compatible

multivariate setting. Our contribution is to tie together many of these tests,
drawing connections between seemingly very different statistics. In this work,
our central object is the Wasserstein distance, as we form a chain of
connections from univariate methods like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, PP/QQ
plots and ROC/ODC curves, to multivariate tests involving energy statistics and
kernel based maximum mean discrepancy. Some connections proceed through the
construction of a \textit{smoothed} Wasserstein distance, and others through
the pursuit of a ""distribution-free"" Wasserstein test. Some observations in
this chain are implicit in the literature, while others seem to have not been
noticed thus far. Given nonparametric two sample testing's classical and
continued importance, we aim to provide useful connections for theorists and
practitioners familiar with one subset of methods but not others.

recommender systems, time series analysis, etc. However, there are not many
successful applications regarding social media in government agencies. In fact,
lots of governments have social media accounts such as twitter and facebook.
More and more customers are likely to communicate with governments on social
media, causing massive external social media data for governments. This
external data would be beneficial for analysing behaviours and real needs of
the customers. Besides this, most governments also have a call centre to help
customers solve their problems. It is not difficult to imagine that the
enquiries on external social media and internal call centre may have some
coupling relationships. The couplings could be helpful for studying customers'
intent and allocating government's limited resources for better service. In
this paper, we mainly focus on analysing the coupling relations between
internal call centre and external public media using time series analysis
methods for Australia Department of Immigration and Border Protec-tion. The
discovered couplings demonstrate that call centre and public media indeed have
correlations, which are significant for understanding customers' behaviours.

various scales in the solution. The basis functions are constructed based on
some local snapshot spaces and local spectral problems defined on them. The
spectral problems give a natural ordering of the basis functions in the
snapshot space and allow systematically enrichment of basis functions. In
addition, by using a staggered coarse mesh, our method is energy conserving and
has block diagonal mass matrix, which are desirable properties for wave
propagation. We will prove that our method has spectral convergence, and
present numerical results to show the performance of the method.

superconductivity and spintronics, with the goal to pave a way for new types of
devices for applications combining the virtues of both by offering the
possibility of long-range spin-polarized supercurrents. Such supercurrents
constitute a fruitful basis for the study of fundamental physics as they
combine macroscopic quantum coherence with microscopic exchange interactions,
spin selectivity, and spin transport. This report follows recent developments
in the controlled creation of long-range equal-spin triplet supercurrents in
ferromagnets and its contribution to spintronics. The mutual proximity-induced
modification of order in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures
introduces in a natural way such evasive phenomena as triplet
superconductivity, odd-frequency pairing, Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
pairing, long-range equal-spin supercurrents, $\pi$-Josephson junctions, as
well as long-range magnetic proximity effects. All these effects were rather
exotic before 2000, when improvements in nanofabrication and materials control
allowed for a new quality of hybrid structures. Guided by pioneering
theoretical studies, experimental progress evolved rapidly, and since 2010
triplet supercurrents are routinely produced and observed. We have entered a
new stage of studying new phases of matter previously out of our reach, and of
merging the hitherto disparate fields of superconductivity and spintronics to a
new research direction: super-spintronics.

a coronal mass ejection (CME). It has been found that CME apparent mass
measured from the brightness enhancement in coronagraph images shows an
increasing trend during its evolution in the corona. However, the physics
behind it is not clear. Does the apparent mass gain come from the mass outflow
from the dimming regions in the low corona, or from the pileup of the solar
wind plasma around the CME when it propagates outwards from the Sun? We
analyzed the mass evolution of six CME events. Their mass can increase by a
factor of 1.6 to 3.2 from 4 to 15 Rs in the field of view (FOV) of the
coronagraph on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). Over
the distance about 7 to 15 Rs, where the coronagraph occulting effect can be
negligible, the mass can increase by a factor of 1.3 to 1.7. We adopted the
`snow-plough' model to calculate the mass contribution of the piled-up solar
wind in the height range from about 7 to 15 Rs. For 2/3 of the events, the
solar wind pileup is not sufficient to explain the measured mass increase. In
the height range from about 7 to 15 Rs, the ratio of the modeled to the
measured mass increase is roughly larger than 0.55. Although the ratios are
believed to be overestimated, the result gives evidence that the solar wind
pileup probably makes a non-negligible contribution to the mass increase. It is
not clear yet whether the solar wind pileup is a major contributor to the final
mass derived from coronagraph observations. However, our study suggests that
the solar wind pileup plays increasingly important role in the mass increase as
a CME moves further away from the Sun.

Mathematically we derive lower bounds in the errors that any parameter
estimator will have in the absence of prior knowledge to distinguish between
the post-Einsteinian (ppE) description of coalescing binary systems and that of
general relativity. When such errors are smaller than the parameter value,
there is possibility to detect these violations from GR. A parameter space with
inclusion of dominant dephasing ppE parameters $(\beta, b)$ is used for a study
of first- and second-order (co)variance expansions, focusing on the inspiral
stage of a nonspinning binary system of zero eccentricity detectible through
Adv. LIGO and Adv. Virgo. Our procedure is an improvement of the Cram\'{e}r-Rao
Lower Bound. When Bayesian errors are lower than our bound it means that they
depend critically on the priors. The analysis indicates the possibility of
constraining deviations from GR in inspiral SNR ($\rho \sim 15-17$) regimes
that are achievable in upcoming scientific runs (GW150914 had an inspiral SNR
$\sim 12$). The errors on $\beta$ also increase errors of other parameters such
as the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$ and symmetric mass ratio $\eta$. Application is
done to existing alternative theories of gravity, which include modified
dispersion relation of the waveform, non-spinning models of quadratic modified

complete intersection theorem, itself an extension of the $t$-intersecting
Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem. Their intersection theorem says that the maximum
size of a family of subsets of $[n] = \{1, \dots, n\}$, every pair of which
intersects in at least $t$ elements, is the size of certain trivially
intersecting families proposed by Frankl. We address a cross intersecting
version of their diametric theorem.
  Two families $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $[n]$ are {\em
cross $t$-intersecting} if for every $A \in \mathcal{A}$ and $B \in
\mathcal{B}$, $A$ and $B$ intersect in at least $t$ elements. The $p$-weight of
a $k$ element subset $A$ of $[n]$ is $p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$, and the weight of a
family $\mathcal{A}$ is the sum of the weights of its sets. The weight of a
pair of families is the product of the weights of the families.
  The maximum $p$-weight of a $t$-intersecting family depends on the value of
$p$. Ahlswede and Khachatrian showed that for $p$ in the range $[\frac{r}{t +
2r - 1}, \frac{r+1}{t + 2r + 1}]$, the maximum $p$-weight of a $t$-intersecting
family is that of the family $\mathcal{F}^t_r$ consisting of all subsets of
$[n]$ containing at least $t+r$ elements of the set $[t+2r]$.
  In a previous paper we showed a cross $t$-intersecting version of this for
large $t$ in the case that $r = 0$. In this paper, we do the same in the case
that $r = 1$. We show that for $p$ in the range $[\frac{1}{t + 1}, \frac{2}{t +
3}]$ the maximum $p$-weight of a cross $t$-intersecting pair of families, for
$t \geq 200$, is achieved when both families are $\mathcal{F}^t_1$. Further, we
show that except at the endpoints of this range, this is, up to isomorphism,
the only pair of $t$-intersecting families achieving this weight.

exchange pulse. This approach uses energy gaps to suppress leakage rather than
conventional pulse sequences. In this paper we present analysis and simulations
of our proposed two-qubit gate subject to charge and Overhauser field noise at

powerful tools for the in-depth characterization of multilayer properties

stack parameters is however difficult because the XRR scans depend on them in a
complex way. The PPM code, developed at ERSF in the past years, is able to
derive the layer-by-layer properties of multilayer structures from
semi-automatic XRR scan fittings by means of a global minimization procedure in
the parameters space. In this work we will present the PPM modeling of some
multilayer stacks (Pt/C and Ni/C) deposited by simple e-beam evaporation.
Moreover, in order to verify the predictions of PPM, the obtained results are
compared with TEM profiles taken on the same set of samples. As we will show,
PPM results are in good agreement with the TEM findings. In addition, we show
that the accurate fitting returns a physically correct evaluation of the

While fair-sharing schemes are commonly suggested as a defense when
differentiation is difficult, they alone may suffer from highly variable or
even unbounded waiting times. We propose RainCheck Filter (RCF), a lightweight
primitive that guarantees bounded waiting time for clients despite server
flooding without keeping per-client state on the server. RCF achieves strong
waiting time guarantees by prioritizing clients based on how long the clients
have waited-as if the server maintained a queue in which the clients lined up
waiting for service. To avoid keeping state for every incoming client request,
the server sends to the client a raincheck, a timestamped cryptographic token
that not only informs the client to retry later but also serves as a proof of
the client's priority level within the virtual queue. We prove that every
client complying with RCF can access the server in bounded time, even under a
flash crowd incident or a DDoS attack. Our large-scale simulations confirm that
RCF provides a small and predictable maximum waiting time while existing
schemes cannot. To demonstrate its deployability, we implement RCF as a Python
module such that web developers can protect a critical server resource by
adding only three lines of code.

experiments of neutrino capture on beta-decaying nuclei (e.g., $\nu^{}_e +

distinguish between Majorana and Dirac neutrinos, since the capture rate is
twice larger in the former case. In this paper, we investigate the possible
impact of right-handed neutrinos on the capture rate, assuming that massive
neutrinos are Dirac particles and both right-handed neutrinos $\nu^{}_{\rm R}$
and left-handed antineutrinos $\overline{\nu}^{}_{\rm L}$ can be efficiently
produced in the early Universe. It turns out that the capture rate can be
enhanced at most by $28\%$ due to the presence of relic $\nu^{}_{\rm R}$ and
$\overline{\nu}^{}_{\rm L}$ with a total number density of $95~{\rm cm}^{-3}$,
which should be compared to the number density $336~{\rm cm}^{-3}$ of cosmic
neutrino background. The enhancement has actually been limited by the latest
cosmological and astrophysical bounds on the effective number of neutrino
generations $N^{}_{\rm eff} = 3.14^{+0.44}_{-0.43}$ at the $95\%$ confidence

observations from the epoch of reionization is to limit observations to an
uncontaminated window in Fourier space. Foreground emission can be avoided in
this way, since it is limited to a wedge-shaped region in $k_{\parallel},
k_{\perp}$ space. However, the power spectrum is anisotropic owing to
redshift-space distortions from peculiar velocities. Consequently, the 21-cm
power spectrum measured in the foreground avoidance window---which samples only
a limited range of angles close to the line-of-sight direction---differs from
the full spherically-averaged power spectrum which requires an average over
\emph{all} angles. In this paper, we calculate the magnitude of this ""wedge
bias"" for the first time. We find that the bias is strongest at high redshifts,
where measurements using foreground avoidance will over-estimate the power
spectrum by around 100 per cent, possibly obscuring the distinctive rise and
fall signature that is anticipated for the spherically-averaged 21-cm power
spectrum. In the later stages of reionization, the bias becomes negative, and
smaller in magnitude ($\lesssim 20$ per cent). The effect shows only a weak
dependence on spatial scale and reionization topology.

widely used to investigate the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk, which can
impose an important constraint on the planet formation mechanism. The
relationship between the decay timescale of the disk fraction and the mass
dissipation timescale of an individual disk, however, remains unclear. Here we
investigate the effect of the disk mass function (DMF) on the evolution of the
disk fraction. We show that the time variation in the disk fraction depends on
the spread of the DMF and the detection threshold of the disk. In general, the
disk fraction decreases more slowly than the disk mass if a typical initial DMF
and a detection threshold are assumed. We find that, if the disk mass decreases
exponentially, {the mass dissipation timescale of the disk} can be as short as
$1\,{\rm Myr}$ even when the disk fraction decreases with the time constant of
${\sim}2.5\,{\rm Myr}$. The decay timescale of the disk fraction can be an
useful parameter to investigate the disk lifetime, but the difference between
the mass dissipation of an individual disk and the decrease in the disk
fraction should be properly appreciated to estimate the timescale of the disk
mass dissipation.

a Saturnian year (2004-2014, from northern winter to northern spring). The
thermal field reveals evidence of reversing summertime asymmetries superimposed
onto the belt/zone structure. The temperature structure that is almost
symmetric about the equator by 2014, with seasonal lag times that increase with
depth and are qualitatively consistent with radiative climate models. Localised
heating of the tropospheric hazes (100-250 mbar) create a distinct perturbation
to the temperature profile that shifts in magnitude and location, declining in
the autumn hemisphere and growing in the spring. Changes in the para-H$_2$
($f_p$) distribution are subtle, with a 0.02-0.03 rise over the spring
hemisphere (200-500 mbar) perturbed by (i) low-$f_p$ air advected by both the
springtime storm of 2010 and equatorial upwelling; and (ii) subsidence of
high-$f_p$ air at northern high latitudes, responsible for a developing
north-south asymmetry in $f_p$. Conversely, the shifting asymmetry in the
para-H$_2$ disequilibrium primarily reflects the changing temperature structure
(and the equilibrium distribution of $f_p$), rather than actual changes in
$f_p$ induced by chemical conversion or transport. CIRS results interpolated to
the same point in the seasonal cycle as re-analysed Voyager-1 observations show
qualitative consistency, with the exception of the tropical tropopause near the
equatorial zones and belts, where downward propagation of a cool temperature
anomaly associated with Saturn's stratospheric oscillation could potentially
perturb tropopause temperatures, para-H$_2$ and winds. [ABRIDGED]

the toroidal one, indicative of an $\alpha^2$-type of a dynamo, in which
convective turbulence effects dominate over the weak differential rotation. In
two of the cases there is a slight anti-correlation between the cool spots and
the strength of the radial magnetic field. However, even in these cases the
correlation is much weaker than in the case of sunspots. The weak correlation
between the measured radial magnetic field and cool spots may indicate a more
complex magnetic field structure in the spots or spot groups involving mixed
magnetic polarities. Comparison with a previously published magnetic field map

Multi-Pixel Photon Counters (MPPCs), have been studied in depth. Several
components of the correlated noise have been identified according to their
different possible causes and their effects on the signal. In particular, we
have distinguished between prompt and delayed crosstalk as well as between
trap-assisted and hole-induced afterpulsing. The prompt crosstalk has been
characterized through the pulse amplitude spectrum measured at dark conditions.
The newest MPPC series, which incorporate isolating trenches between pixels,
exhibit a very low prompt crosstalk, but a small component remains likely due
to secondary photons reflected on the top surface of the device and
photon-generated minority carriers diffusing in the silicon substrate. We
present a meticulous procedure to characterize the afterpulsing and delayed
crosstalk through the amplitude and delay time distributions of secondary
pulses. Our results indicate that both noise components are due to minority
carriers diffusing in the substrate and that this effect is drastically reduced
in the new MPPC series as a consequence of an increase of one order of
magnitude in the doping density of the substrate. Finally, we have developed a
Monte Carlo simulation to study the different components of the afterpulsing
and crosstalk. The simulation results support our interpretation of the
experimental data. They also demonstrate that trenches longer than those

for developing a new code generator is to write a reference implementation and
separate it into handwritten and generatable code. Typically, the generator
developer manually performs this separation a process that is often
time-consuming, labor-intensive, difficult to maintain and may produce more

that uses the concept of software categories to semi-automatically determine
candidates for generated code. The main idea is to iteratively derive the
categories for uncategorized code from the dependencies of categorized code.
The candidates for generated or handwritten code finally are code parts
belonging to specific (previously defined) categories. This approach helps the

characterize the capacity of this model as a series expansion in the low-noise

supremizing input set in the capacity formula. While the property is prevalent

lengths (10 - 20 m), and will consist of a number of nested/stacked thin,
grazing-incidence mirrors. The optical quality characterization of a real
mirror can be obtained via profile metrology, and the Point Spread Function of
the mirror can be derived via one of the standard computation methods. However,
in practical cases it can be difficult to access the optical surfaces of
densely stacked mirror shells, after they have been assembled, using the
widespread metrological tools. For this reason, the assessment of the imaging
resolution of a system of mirrors is better obtained via a direct,
full-illumination test in X-rays. If the focus cannot be reached, an
intra-focus test can be performed, and the image can be compared with the
simulation results based on the metrology, if available. However, until today
no quantitative information was extracted from a full-illumination, intra-focal
exposure. In this work we show that, if the detector is located at an optimal
distance from the mirror, the intensity variations of the intra-focal,
full-illumination image in single reflection can be used to reconstruct the
profile of the mirror surface, without the need of a wavefront sensor. The
Point Spread Function can be subsequently computed from the reconstructed
mirror shape. We show the application of this method to an intra-focal (8 m
distance from mirror) test performed at PANTER on an optical module prototype
made of hot-slumped glass foils with a 20 m focal length, from which we could

Name ambiguity, word polysemy, context dependencies and a heavy-tailed

  We here propose a probabilistic approach that makes use of an effective
graphical model to perform collective entity disambiguation. Input mentions
(i.e.,~linkable token spans) are disambiguated jointly across an entire
document by combining a document-level prior of entity co-occurrences with
local information captured from mentions and their surrounding context. The
model is based on simple sufficient statistics extracted from data, thus
relying on few parameters to be learned.
  Our method does not require extensive feature engineering, nor an expensive
training procedure. We use loopy belief propagation to perform approximate
inference. The low complexity of our model makes this step sufficiently fast
for real-time usage. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach on a wide
range of benchmark datasets, showing that it matches, and in many cases
outperforms, existing state-of-the-art methods.

pick-and-place regrasp which reorients an object from one placement to another

results, we find dual-arm regrasp is not necessarily better than single-arm
regrasp: Dual-arm regrasp is flexible. When the two hands can grasp the object
with good clearance, dual-arm regrasp is better and has higher successful rate
than single-arm regrasp. However, dual-arm regrasp suffers from geometric
constraints caused by the two arms. When the grasps overlap, dual-arm regrasp
is bad. Developers need to sample grasps with high density to reduce
overlapping. This leads to exploded combinatorics in previous methods, but is
possible with the algorithms presented in this paper. Following the results,
practitioners may choose single-arm or dual-arm robots by considering the
object shapes and grasps. Meanwhile, they can reduce overlapping and implement
practical dual-arm regrasp by using the presented algorithms.

invariance are exactly accounted for, our semiclassical approach captures
quantum interference and therefore is valid well beyond the Ehrenfest time

special feature of harmonic systems with incommesurable frequencies, our

pinning properties in the superconducting state within the framework of
collective pinning. The magneto-transport measurements show a non-Arrhenius
behaviour of the temperature and field dependent resistivity in the flux flow
region. This non-Arrhenius behaviour is understood in terms of a model, which
was originally proposed for viscous flow of disordered solids and is popularly
known in the literature as the `shoving' model. The activation energy for flux
flow is obtained from magneto-transport measurements and is assumed to be
mainly the elastic energy stored in the flux-line lattice. The scaling of
pinning force density with respect to reduced field indicates the presence of
two pinning mechanisms of different origins. The elastic constants of the
flux-line lattice are estimated from magnetization measurements and are used to
estimate the length scale of vortex lattice movement, or the volume displaced
by the flux-line lattice, during flux flow. It appears that the vortex lattice
displacement estimated from elastic energy considerations is of the same order
of magnitude as that of the flux-bundle hopping length when a finite resistance
appears during flux flow. Our results could provide possible directions for

have been devoted to study the importance of the pre-processing techniques. In
this paper, we analyze the importance of the pre-processing, and investigate
the role of Gaussian Scale Space (GSS) theory as a pre-processing approach for
the HEp-2 cell classification task. We validate the GSS pre-processing under
the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and the Bag-of-Words (BoW) frameworks. Under the
BoW framework, the introduced pre-processing approach, using only one Local
Orientation Adaptive Descriptor (LOAD), achieved superior performance on the
Executable Thematic on Pattern Recognition Techniques for Indirect
Immunofluorescence (ET-PRT-IIF) image analysis. Our system, using only one
feature, outperformed the winner of the ICPR 2014 contest that combined four
types of features. Meanwhile, the proposed pre-processing method is not
restricted to this work; it can be generalized to many existing works.

M$_{*}$ = $1.112_{-0.061}^{+0.055}$ M$_{\odot}$ and radius R$_{*}$ =

$1.399_{-0.049}^{+0.069}$ R$_{J}$ and mass M$_{P}$ = $0.679_{-0.038}^{+0.039}$

ephemeris is $T_{0}$ = 2457066.72045$\pm$0.00027 BJD$_{TDB}$ and P =
4.1662739$\pm$0.0000063 days. This planet joins a group of highly inflated

of Jupiter. The planet, which boasts deep transits of 1.4%, has a relatively
high equilibrium temperature of T$_{eq}$ = $1377_{-23}^{+28}$ K, assuming zero

insolation of $0.817_{-0.054}^{+0.068}$ $\times$ 10$^9$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$,

Carlo simulations. These networks are characterized by a degree distribution of
the form P(k) ~ k^(-gamma) for large k. Clustering is introduced in the
networks by inserting triangles, i.e., triads of connected nodes. The
transition from a ferromagnetic (FM) to a paramagnetic (PM) phase has been
studied as a function of the exponent gamma and the triangle density. For gamma
> 3 our results are in line with earlier simulations, and a phase transition
appears at a temperature T_c(gamma) in the thermodynamic limit (system size N
to infinity). For gamma <= 3, a FM-PM crossover appears at a size-dependent
temperature T_co, so that the system remains in a FM state at any finite
temperature in the limit N to infinity. Thus, for gamma = 3, T_co scales as ln
N, whereas for gamma < 3, we find T_co ~ J N^z, where the exponent z decreases
for increasing gamma. Adding motifs (triangles in our case) to the networks
causes an increase in the transition (or crossover) temperature for exponent
gamma > 3 (or <= 3). For gamma > 3, this increase is due to changes in the mean
values < k > and < k^2 >, i.e., the transition is controlled by the degree
distribution (nearest neighbor connectivities). For gamma <= 3, however, we
find that clustered and unclustered networks with the same size and
distribution P(k) have different crossover temperature, i.e., clustering favors
FM correlations, thus increasing the temperature T_co. The effect of a degree
cutoff k_cut on the asymptotic behavior of T_co is discussed.

inference, model comparison, and model-averaging techniques to the inference of
the cross-field density structuring in solar magnetic waveguides using
information on periods and damping times for resonantly damped
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) transverse kink oscillations. Three commonly employed
alternative profiles were used to model the variation of the mass density
across the waveguide boundary. Parameter inference enabled us to obtain
information on physical quantities such as the Alfv\'en travel time, the
density contrast, and the transverse inhomogeneity length scale. The inference
results from alternative density models were compared and their differences
quantified. Then, the relative plausibility of the considered models was
assessed by performing model comparison. Our results indicate that the evidence
in favor of any of the three models is minimal, unless the oscillations are
strongly damped. In such a circumstance, the application of model-averaging
techniques enables the computation of an evidence-weighted inference that takes

microtubule tracks, from the deterministic linear or helical motion performed

these different strategies produce an efficient navigation system needed to
ensure correct cellular functioning is still unclear. Here, we show by
numerical simulations that deterministic and random motor steps yield different
outcomes when random obstacles decorate the microtubule tracks: kinesin moves
faster on clean tracks but its motion is strongly hindered on decorated tracks,
while dynein is slower on clean tracks but more efficient in avoiding

different navigation strategies are employed by the cell to optimize motor

thermodynamic volumes and masses differ in such that there are high and low

the compressibility at fixed total entropy and find that it diverges at the
maximal entropy point. Hence a picture emerges of high and low density phases
merging at this critical point.

The SBM assumes that the networkhas a stationary structure, in which
connections of time varying intensity are not taken into account. In other
words, interactions between two groups are forced to have the same features
during the whole observation time. To overcome this limitation,we propose a
partition of the whole time horizon, in which interactions are observed, and
develop a non stationary extension of the SBM,allowing to simultaneously
cluster the nodes in a network along with fixed time intervals in which the
interactions take place. The number of clusters (K for nodes, D for time
intervals) as well as the class memberships are finallyobtained through
maximizing the complete-data integrated likelihood by means of a greedy search
approach. After showing that the model works properly with simulated data, we
focus on a real data set. We thus consider the three days ACM Hypertext

interestingclustering of the daily hours is finally obtained, with times of
social gathering (e.g. coffee breaks) recovered by the approach. Applications
to large networks are limited due to the computational complexity of the greedy
search which is dominated bythe number $K\_{max}$ and $D\_{max}$ of clusters
used in the initialization. Therefore,advanced clustering tools are considered
to reduce the number of clusters expected in the data, making the greedy search

of nuclear density functional theory, the quasiparticle random phase
approximation (QRPA) is commonly used. Purpose: We present a computationally
efficient, fully self-consistent framework to compute the QRPA transition
strength function of an arbitrary multipole operator in axially-deformed
superfluid nuclei. Methods: The method is based on the finite amplitude method
(FAM) QRPA, allowing fast iterative solution of QRPA equations. A numerical
implementation of the FAM-QRPA solver module has been carried out for deformed
nuclei. Results: The practical feasibility of the deformed FAM module has been
demonstrated. In particular, we calculate the quadrupole and octupole strength
in a heavy deformed nucleus $^{240}$Pu, without any truncations in the
quasiparticle space. To demonstrate the capability to calculate individual QRPA
modes, we also compute low-lying negative-parity collective states in
$^{154}$Sm. Conclusions: The new FAM implementation enables calculations of the
QRPA strength function throughout the nuclear landscape. This will facilitate
global surveys of multipole modes and beta decays, and will open new avenues
for constraining the nuclear energy density functional.

Five distinct TiO\sub{x} phases were identified: the \emph{honeycomb} and
\emph{pinwheel} phases appear as monolayer films wetting the gold surface,
while nanocrystallites of the \emph{triangular}, \emph{row} and \emph{needle}
phases grow mainly over the honeycomb or pinwheel layers. Density Functional
Theory (DFT) investigation of the honeycomb structure supports a $(2\times 2)$
structural model based on a Ti-O bilayer having $\text{Ti}_2\text{O}_3$
stoichiometry. The pinwheel phase was observed to evolve, for increasing
coverage, from single triangular crystallites to a well-ordered film forming a
$(4\sqrt{7}\times 4\sqrt{7})R19.1^\circ$ superstructure, which can be
interpreted within a moir\~A\c{opyright}-like model. Structural characteristics
of the other three phases were disclosed from the analysis of high-resolution
STM measurements. STS measurements revealed a partial metallization of
honeycomb and pinwheel and a semiconducting character of row and triangular
phases.

systematic approach to calculate strain-displacement relations for several
classes of 2d materials. We apply our findings to graphene as a study case, by
combining a tight binding and a valence force-field model to calculate
electronic and mechanical properties of graphene nanoribbons under strain. The
results show good agreement with the predictions of the Dirac equation coupled
to continuum mechanics. For this long wave-limit effective theory, we find that
the strain-displacement relations lead to a renormalization correction to the

nonlocal density-density interactions in two dimensions, based on bond-centered
auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo. The simulations are shown to be
sign-problem free within a finite, restricted parameter range. Using this
approach, we first study the Hubbard model on the half-filled square lattice
bilayer, including an interlayer repulsion term in addition to the local
repulsion, and present the ground state phase diagram within the accessible
parameter region. Starting from the antiferromagnetically ordered state in the
absence of interlayer repulsion, the interlayer interactions are found to
destabilize the antiferromagnetic order, leading to a band insulator state.
Moreover, for sufficiently strong interlayer tunneling, we also observe the
emergence of a direct dimer product state of mixed D-Mott and S-Mott character
along the equal coupling line. We discuss the stability range of this state
within strong-coupling perturbation theory. Furthermore, we consider the
Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice with next-nearest-neighbor interactions.
Such an interaction is found to enhance both charge density and spin-current
correlations within the semimetallic region. However, inside the accessible
parameter region, they do not stabilize long-ranged charge density wave order
nor a quantum spin Hall state, and the only insulating state that we observe
exhibits long-range antiferromagnetism.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stv2096",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimates of the mass distribution and dark-matter (DM) content of dwarf
spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are usually derived under the assumption that the
effect of the tidal field of the host galaxy is negligible over the radial
extent probed by kinematic data-sets. We assess the implications of this
assumption in the specific case of the Fornax dSph by means of N-body
simulations of a satellite orbiting around the Milky Way. We consider
observationally-motivated orbits and we tailor the initial distributions of the
satellite's stars and DM to match, at the end of the simulations, the observed
structure and kinematics of Fornax. In all our simulations the present-day
observable properties of Fornax are not significantly influenced by tidal
effects. The DM component is altered by the interaction with the Galactic field
(up to 20% of the DM mass within 1.6 kpc is lost), but the structure and
kinematics of the stellar component are only mildly affected even in the more
eccentric orbit (more than 99% of the stellar particles remain bound to the
dwarf). In the simulations that successfully reproduce Fornax's observables,
the dark-to-luminous mass ratio within 1.6 kpc is in the range 5-6, and up to
16-18 if measured within 3 kpc.

algorithms which are based on the technique of backtracking, a standard
approach for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Backtracking
algorithms explore a tree whose vertices are partial solutions to a CSP in an
attempt to find a complete solution. Assume there is a classical backtracking
algorithm which finds a solution to a CSP on n variables, or outputs that none
exists, and whose corresponding tree contains T vertices, each vertex
corresponding to a test of a partial solution. Then we show that there is a
bounded-error quantum algorithm which completes the same task using O(sqrt(T)
n^(3/2) log n) tests. In particular, this quantum algorithm can be used to
speed up the DPLL algorithm, which is the basis of many of the most efficient
SAT solvers used in practice. The quantum algorithm is based on the use of a
quantum walk algorithm of Belovs to search in the backtracking tree. We also
discuss how, for certain distributions on the inputs, the algorithm can lead to
an exponential reduction in expected runtime.

on a linear subspace in the TDOA space. Noise, however, prevents TDOAs from
lying exactly on this subspace. We therefore show that TDOA denoising can be
seen as a projection operation that suppresses the component of the noise that
is orthogonal to that linear subspace. We then generalize the projection
operator also to the cases where the set of TDOAs is incomplete. We
analytically show that this operator improves the localization accuracy, and we

1000 times the volume of the cell. Since prokaryotes lack a membrane-bound
nucleus, in sharp contrast with eukaryotes, the DNA may consequently be
expected to occupy the whole available volume when constrained to fit in the
cell. Still, it has been known for more than half a century that the DNA is
localized in a well defined region of the cell, called the nucleoid, which
occupies only 15% to 25% of the total volume. Although this problem has focused
the attention of many scientists for the past decades, there is still no
certainty concerning the mechanism that enables such a dramatic compaction. The
goal of this Topical Review is to take stock of our knowledge on this question
by listing all possible compaction mechanisms with the proclaimed desire to
clarify the physical principles they are based upon and discuss them in the
light of experimental results and the results of simulations based on
coarse-grained models. In particular, the fundamental differences between
psi-condensation and segregative phase separation and between the condensation
by small and long polycations are highlighted. This review suggests that the
importance of certain mechanisms, like supercoiling and the architectural
properties of DNA-bridging and DNA-bending nucleoid proteins, may have been
overestimated, whereas other mechanisms, like segregative phase separation and
the self-association of nucleoid proteins, as well as the possible role of the
synergy of two or more mechanisms, may conversely deserve more attention.

possible inputs and outputs are known a priori, we address the problem of
determining the communication between outputs and inputs, i.e., information
patterns, such that desired control objectives of the closed-loop system (for
instance, stabilizability) through static output feedback may be ensured.
  We address this problem in the structural system theoretic context. To this
end, given a specified structural pattern (locations of zeros/non-zeros) of the
plant matrices, we introduce the concept of essential information patterns,
i.e., communication patterns between outputs and inputs that satisfy the
following conditions: (i) ensure arbitrary spectrum assignment of the
closed-loop system, using static output feedback constrained to the information
pattern, for almost all possible plant instances with the specified structural
pattern; and (ii) any communication failure precludes the resulting information
pattern from attaining the pole placement objective in (i).
  Subsequently, we study the problem of determining essential information
patterns. First, we provide several necessary and sufficient conditions to
verify whether a specified information pattern is essential or not. Further, we
show that such conditions can be verified by resorting to algorithms with
polynomial complexity (in the dimensions of the state, input and output).
Although such verification can be performed efficiently, it is shown that the
problem of determining essential information patterns is in general NP-hard.
The main results of the paper are illustrated through examples.

as particular cases when the due dates of all jobs are either set to zero or to
their associated release dates, respectively. The developed local search based
metaheuristic framework is quite simple, but at the same time relies on
sophisticated procedures for efficiently performing local search according to
the characteristics of the problem. We present efficient move evaluation
approaches for some parallel machine problems that generalize the existing ones
for single machine problems. The algorithm was tested in hundreds of instances

keV and some MeV being collected by the grazing-incidence mirrors and funneled
to the detector. For a focusing telescope like SIMBOL-X, the exposure of the
soft X-ray detector to the proton flux can increase significantly the
instrumental background, with a consequent loss of sensitivity. In the worst
case, it can also seriously compromise the detector duration. A well-known
countermeasure that can be adopted is the implementation of a properly-designed
magnetic diverter, that should prevent high-energy particles from reaching the

deformation coupled to their motion. We introduce an iterative solution scheme
which couples hydrodynamic boundary integral methods and elastic shape
equations to find the stationary axisymmetric shape and the velocity of an
elastic capsule moving in a viscous fluid at low Reynolds numbers. We use this
approach to systematically study dynamical shape transitions of capsules with
Hookean stretching and bending energies and spherical rest shape sedimenting
under the influence of gravity or centrifugal forces. We find three types of
possible axisymmetric stationary shapes for sedimenting capsules with fixed
volume: a pseudospherical state, a pear-shaped state, and buckled shapes.
Capsule shapes are controlled by two dimensionless parameters, the
F\""oppl-von-K\'arm\'an number characterizing the elastic properties and a Bond
number characterizing the driving force. For increasing gravitational force the
spherical shape transforms into a pear shape. For very large bending rigidity
(very small F\""oppl-von-K\'arm\'an number) this transition is discontinuous
with shape hysteresis. The corresponding transition line terminates, however,
in a critical point, such that the discontinuous transition is not present at
typical F\""oppl-von-K\'arm\'an numbers of synthetic capsules. In an additional
bifurcation, buckled shapes occur upon increasing the gravitational force. This
type of instability should be observable for generic synthetic capsules. All
shape bifurcations can be resolved in the force-velocity relation of
sedimenting capsules, where up to three capsule shapes with different
velocities can occur for the same driving force. All three types of possible
axisymmetric stationary shapes are stable with respect to rotation during
sedimentation.

pointing at the same position in the sky. The MAGIC field of view (FoV)
acceptance for hadrons and gamma rays has a complex shape, which depends on
several parameters such as the azimuth and zenith angle of the observations. In
the standard MAGIC analysis, the strategy adopted for estimating this
acceptance is not optimal in the case of complex FoVs.
  In this contribution we present the results of systematic studies intended to

scales between the short Kepler orbital periods and the longer orbital
precessional periods. The collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) for the
stellar distribution function (DF) is averaged over the fast Kepler orbital
phase using the method of multiple scales. The orbit-averaged system is
described by a secular DF, $F$, in a reduced phase space. $F$ obeys a secular
CBE that includes stellar self-gravity, general relativistic corrections up to
1.5 post-Newtonian order, and external sources varying over secular times.
Secular dynamics, even with general time dependence, conserves the semi-major
axis of every star. This additional integral of motion promotes extra
regularity of the stellar orbits, and enables the construction of equilibria,
$F_0$, through a secular Jeans theorem. A linearized secular CBE determines the

increased robustness in realistic simulated data. Besides long-duration CWs,
neutron stars could also emit transient signals which, for a limited time, also
follow the CW signal model (tCWs). As a pragmatic alternative to specialized
transient searches, we demonstrate how to make standard semicoherent CW
searches more sensitive to transient signals. Considering tCWs in a single

under the combined actions of self-gravity, 1 PN and 1.5 PN relativistic

RR is driven by both apsidal and nodal resonances, so the distinction between
scalar-RR and vector-RR disappears. The system passes through a sequence of
quasi-steady secular collisionless equilibria, driven by irreversible 2-Ring
correlations that accrue through gravitational interactions, both direct and
collective. This correlation function is related to a `wake function', which is
the linear response of the system to the perturbation of a chosen Ring. The
wake function is easier to appreciate, and satisfies a simpler equation, than
the correlation function. We discuss general implications for the interplay of

Noetherian there is a companion $G$-theory of $R[\Gamma]$ which is often easier
to compute. However, it is exceptionally rare that the group ring is Noetherian
for an infinite group.
  In this paper, we define a version of $G$-theory for any finitely generated
discrete group. This construction is based on the coarse geometry of the group.
Therefore it has some expected properties such as independence from the choice
of a word metric. We prove that, whenever $R$ is a regular Noetherian ring of
finite global homological dimension and $\Gamma$ has finite asymptotic
dimension and a finite model for the classifying space $B\Gamma$, the natural
Cartan map from the $K$-theory of $R[\Gamma]$ to $G$-theory is an equivalence.
On the other hand, our $G$-theory is indeed better suited for computation as we
show in a separate paper.

is computationally expensive for such huge systems. In this paper, we assert
that calculating an exact inverse is not necessary to find the ZF/MMSE solution
and an approximate inverse would yield a similar performance. This is possible
if the quantized solution calculated using the approximate inverse is same as
the one calculated using the exact inverse. We quantify the amount of
approximation that can be tolerated for this to happen. Motivated by this, we
propose to use the existing iterative methods for obtaining low complexity
approximate inverses. We show that, after a sufficient number of iterations,
the inverse using iterative methods can provide a similar error performance. In
addition, we also show that the advantage of using an approximate inverse is
not limited to linear detectors but can be extended to non linear detectors
such as sphere decoders (SD). An approximate inverse can be used for any SD
that requires matrix inversion. We prove that application of approximate
inverse leads to a smaller radius, which in turn reduces the search space
leading to reduction in complexity. Numerical results corroborate our claim
that using approximate matrix inversion reduces decoding complexity in
large/massive MIMO systems with no loss in error performance.

understanding the build-up of their stellar content. However, the most accurate
SFHs - those obtained from colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of resolved stars
reaching the oldest main sequence turnoffs (oMSTO) - are presently limited to a
few systems in the Local Group. It is therefore crucial to determine the
reliability and range of applicability of SFHs derived from integrated light
spectroscopy, as this affects our understanding of unresolved galaxies from low
to high redshift.
  To evaluate the reliability of current full spectral fitting techniques in
deriving SFHs from integrated light spectroscopy by comparing SFHs from
integrated spectra to those obtained from deep CMDs of resolved stars.
  We have obtained a high signal--to--noise (S/N $\sim$ 36.3 per \AA)
integrated spectrum of a field in the bar of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
using EFOSC2 at the 3.6 meter telescope at La Silla Observatory. For this same
field, resolved stellar data reaching the oMSTO are available. We have compared
the star formation rate (SFR) as a function of time and the age-metallicity
relation (AMR) obtained from the integrated spectrum using {\tt STECKMAP}, and
the CMD using the IAC-star/MinnIAC/IAC-pop set of routines. For the sake of
completeness we also use and discuss other synthesis codes ({\tt STARLIGHT} and
{\tt ULySS}) to derive the SFR and AMR from the integrated LMC spectrum.
  We find very good agreement (average differences $\sim$ 4.1 $\%$) between the
SFR(t) and the AMR obtained using {\tt STECKMAP} on the integrated light
spectrum, and the CMD analysis. {\tt STECKMAP} minimizes the impact of the
age-metallicity degeneracy and has the advantage of preferring smooth solutions
to recover complex SFHs by means of a penalized $\chi^2$. [abridged]

to model material failure. The empirical potentials which are used in such
simulations are able to adapt to the atomic environment, at the expense of a
significantly higher computational cost than non-reactive potentials. However,
during a simulation of failure, the reactive ability is needed only in some
limited parts of the system, where bonds break or form and the atomic
environment changes. Therefore, simpler non-reactive potentials can be used in
the remainder of the system, provided that such potentials reproduce correctly
the behavior of the reactive potentials in this region, and that seamless
coupling is ensured at the interface between the reactive and non-reactive
regions. In this article, we propose a methodology to combine a reactive
potential with a non-reactive approximation thereof, made of a set of harmonic
pair and angle interactions and whose parameters are adjusted to predict the
same energy, geometry and Hessian in the ground state of the potential. We
present a methodology to construct the non-reactive approximation of the
reactive potential, and a way to couple these two potentials. We also propose a
criterion for on-the-fly substitution of the reactive potential by its
non-reactive approximation during a simulation. We illustrate the correctness
of this hybrid technique for the case of MD simulation of failure in

affect the final chemical abundance. Then we were able to make an efficient
even footing comparison of the [X/Fe] scatter between the elements that have
different number of observable spectral lines in the studied spectra. We found
that the most efficient way of calculating the average abundance of elements
when several spectral lines are available is to use a weighted mean (WM) where
as a weight we considered the distance from the median abundance. This method
can be effectively used without removing suspected outlier lines.We showed that
when the same number of lines is used to determine chemical abundances, the
[X/Fe] star-to-star scatter for iron group and $\alpha$-capture elements is
almost the same. On top of this, but at a lower level the largest scatter was
observed for Al and the smallest for Cr and Ni. We recommend caution when
comparing [X/Fe] scatters among elements that have a different number of
spectral lines available. A meaningful comparison is necessary to identify
elements that show the largest intrinsic scatter and can be thus used for

post-peak softening and fracture of textile composites. Following the
microplane model framework, the constitutive laws are formulated in terms of
stress and strain vectors acting on planes of several orientations within the
material meso-structure. The model exploits the spectral decomposition of the
orthotropic stiffness tensor to define orthogonal strain modes at the
microplane level. These are associated to the various constituents at the
mesoscale and to the material response to different types of deformation.
Strain-dependent constitutive equations are used to relate the microplane
eigenstresses and eigenstrains while a variational principle is applied to
relate the microplane stresses at the mesoscale to the continuum tensor at the
macroscale. Thanks to these features, the resulting spectral stiffness
microplane formulation can easily capture various physical inelastic phenomena
typical of fiber and textile composites such as: matrix microcracking,
micro-delamination, crack bridging, pullout, and debonding. The application of
the model to a twill 2$\times$2 shows that it can realistically predict its
uniaxial as well as multi-axial behavior. Furthermore, the model shows
excellent agreement with experiments on the axial crushing of composite tubes,
this capability making it a valuable design tool for crashworthiness
applications. The formulation is computationally efficient, easy to calibrate
and adaptable to other kinds of composite architectures of great current
interest such as 2D and 3D braids or 3D woven textiles.

perform steady downconversion (""Hamiltonian daemons"") would fulfill the

interpreted as being triggered by the onset of neutron superfluidity in the
core of the star, causing enhanced neutrino emission from neutron Cooper pair
breaking and formation (PBF). This provides a unique possibility for probing
the neutron condensate in the core. Using consistent neutron star core and
crust equation of state and composition, I explore the sensitivity of this
interpretation to the phase state of the triplet superfluid condensate.
Modeling cooling within an expected range of neutron star masses and envelope
compositions, I found that the fast cooling of the Cas A NS can not be
explained by the PBF processes in the conventional $^3$P$_2$ condensate with
$m_{j}=0$.

character of the explosion of its massive progenitor. During the first second
after bounce, the spiral mode of the Standing Accretion Shock Instability
(SASI) is able to redistribute angular momentum and spin-up a neutron star born
from a non-rotating progenitor. Our aim is to assess the robustness of this
process. We perform 2D numerical simulations of a simplified setup in
cylindrical geometry to investigate the timescale over which the dynamics is
dominated by a spiral or a sloshing mode. We observe that the spiral mode
prevails only if the ratio of the initial shock radius to the neutron star
radius exceeds a critical value. In that regime, both the degree of asymmetry
and the average expansion of the shock induced by the spiral mode increase
monotonously with this ratio, exceeding the values obtained when a sloshing
mode is artificially imposed. With a timescale of 2-3 SASI oscillations, the
dynamics of SASI takes place fast enough to affect the spin of the neutron star
before the explosion. The spin periods deduced from the simulations are
compared favorably to analytical estimates evaluated from the measured
saturation amplitude of the SASI wave. Despite the simplicity of our setup,
numerical simulations revealed unexpected stochastic variations, including a
reversal of the direction of rotation of the shock. Our results show that the
spin up of neutron stars by SASI spiral modes is a viable mechanism even though
it is not systematic.

emerged anywhere else. The lack of any sign of extraterrestrial intelligence,
even though on a cosmic timescale extraterrestrial civilizations would have
enough time to cross the galaxy, is known as Fermi's Paradox. One possible
explanation for Fermi's Paradox is the Zoo Hypothesis which states that one or
more extraterrestrial civilizations know of our existence and can reach us, but
have chosen not to disturb us or even make their existence known to us. I
propose here a proactive test of the Zoo Hypothesis. Specifically, I propose to
send a message using television and radio channels to any extraterrestrial
civilization(s) that might be listening and inviting them to respond. Even
though I accept this is unlikely to be successful in the sense of resulting in
a response from extraterrestrial intelligences, the possibility that
extraterrestrial civilizations are monitoring us cannot be dismissed and my
proposal is consistent with current scientific knowledge. Besides, issuing an
invitation is technically feasible, cheap and safe, and few would deny the
profound importance of establishing contact with one or more extraterrestrial
intelligences. A website has been set up (http://active-seti.info) to encourage
discussion of this proposal and for drafting the invitation message.

patterns and 3-D structures. A certain type or shape of the sidewall in the
remaining resist profile may be desired in an application, e.g., an undercut
for lift-off and a vertical sidewall for etching, or required for a device.
Also, as the feature size is decreased well below a micron, a small variation
of the sidewall slope can lead to a significant (relative) CD error in certain
layers of resist. Therefore, it is important to understand effects of spatial
dose distribution on sidewall shape and be able to achieve the desired shape.
In this study, via simulation, the relationship among the total dose, spatial
distribution of dose, developing time and sidewall shape, and performance of
the method developed to optimize the dose distribution for a target sidewall
shape have been analyzed. The simulation results have been verified through
experiments.

infiltration of glue into a porous medium under gravity in 2D. Initially, the
medium is saturated with air and then invaded by a fluid that has a hardening
effect taking place from the interface towards the interior by contact with the
air. To take into account that interfacial hardening, we use an IP model where
capillary pressures of the growth sites are increased with time. In our model,
if a site stays for a certain time at interface, it becomes a hard site and
cannot be invaded anymore. That represents the glue interface becoming hard due
to exposition with the air. Buoyancy forces are included in this system through
the Bond number which represents the competition between the hydrostatic and
capillary forces. We then compare our results with results from literature of
non-hardening fluids in each regime of Bond number. We see that the invasion
patterns change strongly with hardening while the non-hardening behavior
remains basically not affected.

meteoritic impact. The light scattering studies of such dust layer by
laboratory experiment and numerical simulation are two important tools to
investigate their physical properties. In the present work, the light scattered
from a layer of dust particles, containing 0.3{\mu}m Al2O3 at wavelength 632.8
nm is analysed. This work has been performed by using a light scattering
instrument 'ellipsometer', at the Department of Physics, Assam Universiy,
Silchar, India. Through this experiment, we generated in laboratory the
photometric and polarimetric phase curves of light scattered from such a layer.
In order to numerically simulate this data, we used Hapke's model combined with
Mie's single particle scattering properties. The perpendicular and parallel
components of single particle albedo and the phase function were derived from
Mie theory. By using the Hapke's model combined with Mie theory, the physical
properties of the dust grain such as grain size, optical constant (n,k) and
wavelength can be studied through this scheme. In literature, till today no
theoretical model to represent polarisation caused due to scattering from rough
surface is available, which can successfully explain the scattering process. So
the main objective of this work is to develop a model which can theoretically
estimate polarisation as caused due to scattering from rough surface and also
to validate our model with the laboratory data generated in the present work.

feature size is reduced into nanometers. Therefore, minimizing the LER is a
important method to increase the density of circuit patterns. One of the
possible ways is through simulation. The stochastic exposure distributions in
the resist is generated by the Monte Carlo simulation. In addition a resist
development simulation needs to be carried out. Although there are several ways
to simulate or estimate LER but none of them can reveal as much the inner
relationship between LER and different parameters as theocratical analysing
methods can do. In this paper, a new approach to analytically derive the LER
based on the statistical exposure, is described. Our approach is based on
analytic model of stochastic exposure distribution, deriving standard deviation
of exposure and analyzing the variance of edge location after development. Even
though it may not be a complete modeling of LER, it can still show some strong
relationship between LER and some inner parameters.
