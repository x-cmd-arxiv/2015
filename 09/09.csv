desirable properties, such as closure under composition, built-in

matching programmer intuition. Unfortunately, state of the art PEG parsers
struggle with left-recursive grammar rules, which are not supported by the
original definition of the formalism and can lead to infinite recursion under
naive implementations. Likewise, support for associativity and explicit
precedence is spotty. To remedy these issues, we introduce Autumn, a general
purpose PEG library that supports left-recursion, left and right associativity
and precedence rules, and does so efficiently. Furthermore, we identify infix
and postfix operators as a major source of inefficiency in left-recursive PEG
parsers and show how to tackle this problem. We also explore the extensibility
of the PEG paradigm by showing how one can easily introduce new parsing
operators and how our parser accommodates custom memoization and error handling

IceCube telescope has mainly an extragalactic origin. If such neutrinos are
primarily produced by a single class of astrophysical sources via hadronuclear

first time, we employ tomographic constraints to pinpoint the origin of the
IceCube neutrino events by analyzing recent measurements of the cross
correlation between the distribution of GeV gamma rays, detected by the Fermi
satellite, and several galaxy catalogs in different redshift ranges. We find
that the corresponding bounds on the neutrino luminosity density are up to one
order of magnitude tighter than those obtained by using only the spectrum of
the gamma-ray background, especially for sources with mild redshift evolution.
In particular, our method excludes any hadronuclear source with a spectrum
softer than $E^{-2.1}$ as a main component of the neutrino background, if its
evolution is slower than $(1+z)^3$. Starburst galaxies, if able to accelerate
and confine cosmic rays efficiently, satisfy both spectral and tomographic
constraints.

efficient and density modulations are not visible. In the low-density,
weak-confinement regime, the exchange-correlation potential induces small
density modulations as the electrons are depleted from the wire. At the weakest
confinements and lowest densities, the electron density splits into two rows
thereby forming a pair of quantum wires that lie beneath the surface gates. An
additional double-well external potential forms at very low density which
enhances this row splitting phenomenon. We produce phase diagrams that show a
transition between the presence of a single quantum wire in a split-gate
structure and two quantum wires. We suggest that this phenomenon can be used to
pattern and modulate the electron density in low-dimensional structures with
particular application to systems where a proximity effect from a surface gate
would be valuable.

the proposed approach observes game playing behaviors of users and groups them
by their behavioral similarities. Then, it develops a local bot detection model
for each player group. Since the locally optimized models can more accurately
detect game bots within each player group, the combination of those models
brings about overall improvement. For a practical purpose of reducing the
workloads of the game servers in service, the game data is collected at a low

accurately detect game bots with the low resolution data, considering common

the phenomenology of these states, and their possible partners, from this point

partners which have yet to be observed, and the existence or otherwise of
further partners with different isospin, spin, and parity. Future experimental
studies in different decay channels can also discriminate among models, using
selection rules and algebraic relations among decays. Among the several
possible meson-baryon pairs which could be important, one implies that the
states are mixtures of isospins 1/2 and 3/2, with characteristic signatures in
production and decay. A previous experimental study of a Cabibbo-suppressed
decay showed no evidence for the states, and further analysis is required to
establish the significance of this non-observation. Several intriguing
similarities suggest that $P_c(4450)^+$ is related to the $X(3872)$ meson.

that the anisotropic cosmic birefringence signal from any parity-violating

birefringence can be compared with the equivalent quantity generated by
primordial magnetic fields if they existed. The POLARBEAR nondetection
translates into a 95% confidence level (C.L.) upper limit of 93 nanogauss (nG)
on the amplitude of an equivalent primordial magnetic field inclusive of
systematic uncertainties. This four-point correlation constraint on Faraday
rotation is about 15 times tighter than the upper limit of 1380 nG inferred
from constraining the contribution of Faraday rotation to two-point
correlations of $B$-modes measured by Planck in 2015. Metric perturbations
sourced by primordial magnetic fields would also contribute to the $B$-mode
power spectrum. Using the POLARBEAR measurements of the $B$-mode power spectrum
(two-point correlation), we set a 95% C.L. upper limit of 3.9 nG on primordial
magnetic fields assuming a flat prior on the field amplitude. This limit is
comparable to what was found in the Planck 2015 two-point correlation analysis

active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for the same false positive rates as in SDWFS, or
increases the number of sources by 20% while decreasing the false positive
rates by factors of 2-3 for the same variability amplitude. We quantify the
ensemble mid-IR variability of ~1500 spectroscopically confirmed AGNs using
single power-law structure functions (SFs), which we find to be steeper (index
$\gamma=0.45$) than in the optical ($\gamma=0.3$), leading to much lower
amplitudes at short time-lags. This provides evidence for large emission
regions, smoothing out any fast UV/optical variations, as the origin of
infrared quasar variability. The mid-IR AGN SF slope $\gamma$ seems to be
uncorrelated with both the luminosity and rest-frame wavelength, while the
amplitude shows an anti-correlation with the luminosity and a correlation with
the rest-frame wavelength.

liquid crystals with orientation parameter on the sphere in three dimensions.
In particular, we concentrate on a very general class of two- body interaction
potentials including the Onsager kernel. The problem is reformulated as a
non-linear eigenvalue problem for the kernel operator, and a general method to
find the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions is presented. Our main
tools for this analysis are spherical harmonics and a special algorithm for
computing expansions of products of spherical harmon- ics in terms of spherical
harmonics. We find an explicit expression for the set of all bifurcation
points. Using a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we derive a bifurcation equation
depending on five state variables. The dimension of this state space is further
reduced to two dimensions by using the rotational symmetry of the problem and
the theory of invariant polynomials. On the basis of these result, we show that
the first bifurcation occurring in case of the Onsager interaction potential is
a transcritical bifurcation and that the corresponding solution is uniaxial. In
addition, we prove some global proper- ties of the bifurcation diagram such as
the fact that the trivial solution is the unique local minimiser for high
temperatures, that it is not a local minimiser if the temperature is low, the
boundedness of all equilibria of the functional and that the bifurcation
branches are either unbounded or that they meet another bifurcation branch.

network models (CNN) as features for different visual recognition tasks.
Although promising results have been achieved in some empirical studies, such
type of representations still suffer from the well-known issue of semantic gap.
This paper proposes so-called deep attribute framework to alleviate this issue
from three aspects. First, we introduce object region proposals as intermedia
to represent target images, and extract features from region proposals. Second,
we study aggregating features from different CNN layers for all region
proposals. The aggregation yields a holistic yet compact representation of
input images. Results show that cross-region max-pooling of soft-max layer
output outperform all other layers. As soft-max layer directly corresponds to
semantic concepts, this representation is named ""deep attributes"". Third, we
observe that only a small portion of generated regions by object proposals
algorithm are correlated to classification target. Therefore, we introduce
context-aware region refining algorithm to pick out contextual regions and
build context-aware classifiers.
  We apply the proposed deep attributes framework for various vision tasks.
Extensive experiments are conducted on standard benchmarks for three visual
recognition tasks, i.e., image classification, fine-grained recognition and
visual instance retrieval. Results show that deep attribute approaches achieve
state-of-the-art results, and outperforms existing peer methods with a
significant margin, even though some benchmarks have little overlap of concepts
with the pre-trained CNN models.

we check whether loops have been fully unrolled and that the safety property P
holds in all states reachable within k unwindings; and in the inductive step,
we check that whenever P holds for k unwindings, it also holds after the next
unwinding of the system. For each step of the k-induction algorithm, we infer

study the values of the stops masses needed to achieve the correct Higgs mass

projecting the noisy image to a lower dimensional Krylov subspace of the graph
Laplacian, constructed using nonnegative weights determined by distances
between image data corresponding to image pixels. We~extend the construction of
the graph Laplacian to the case, where some graph weights can be negative.
Removing the positivity constraint provides a more accurate inference of a

graph-based signal processing, e.g., denoising, compared to the standard
construction, without affecting the costs.

and let ${\langle X,Y \rangle}$ be a Banach dual pair. In this paper we give
conditions for which there exists a (necessarily unique) bounded linear

  Our first main result states that, in case ${\langle X,Y \rangle} = {\langle

$T_{Y}$ it sufficient that $T$ is dominated by a positive operator.
  Our second main result concerns the case that $T$ is an adjoint operator on
$L^{\infty}(A)$: we suppose that $E = L^{\infty}(A)$ for a semi-finite measure
space $(A,\mathscr{A},\mu)$, that ${\langle F, G \rangle}$ is a K\""othe dual
pair, and that $T$ is $\sigma(L^{\infty}(A),L^{1}(A))$-to-$\sigma(G,F)$

$\sigma(L^{\infty}(A;Y),L^{1}(A;X))$-to-$\sigma(G(Y),F \tilde{\otimes} X)$
continuous; here $F \tilde{\otimes} X$ denotes the closure of $F \otimes X$ in
$F(X)$. We also consider situations in which the existence is automatic and we
furthermore show that in certain situations it is necessary that $T$ is
regular. As an application of this result we consider conditional expectation

accreting neutron stars. Once one location ignites, the flame propagates across
the surface of the star. Flame propagation is fundamental in order to
understand burst properties like rise time and burst oscillations. Previous
work quantified the effects of rotation on the front, showing that the flame
propagates as a deflagration and that the front strongly resembles a hurricane.
However the effect of magnetic fields was not investigated, despite the fact
that magnetic fields strong enough to have an effect on the propagating flame
are expected to be present on many bursters. In this paper we show how the
coupling between fluid layers introduced by an initially vertical magnetic
field plays a decisive role in determining the character of the fronts that are
responsible for the Type I bursts. In particular, on a star spinning at 450 Hz
(typical among the bursters) we test seed magnetic fields of $10^{7} - 10^{10}$
G and find that for the medium fields the magnetic stresses that develop during
the burst can speed up the velocity of the burning front, bringing the
simulated burst rise time close to the observed values. By contrast, in a
magnetic slow rotator like IGR J17480--2446, spinning at 11 Hz, a seed field
$\gtrsim 10^9$ G is required to allow localized ignition and the magnetic field
plays an integral role in generating the burst oscillations observed during the
bursts.

additional assumptions on unconstrained parameters. In a large class of cases

layer, we find that both Ca2Cu6P5 and CaCu(2-x)P2 have temperature-independent
magnetic susceptibility and show metallic behavior with no evidence of either
magnetic ordering or superconductivity down to 1.8 K. CaCu(2-x)P2 is slightly
off-stoichiometric, with delta = 0.14. Theoretical calculations suggest that
unlike Fe 3d-based magnetic materials with a large density of states (DOS) at
the Fermi surface, Cu have comparatively low DOS, with the majority of the 3d
spectral weight located well below Fermi level. The room-temperature
resistivity value of Ca2Cu6P5 is only 9 micro ohm-cm, due to a substantial
plasma frequency and an inferred electron-phonon coupling lambda of 0.073
(significantly smaller than that of metallic Cu). Also, microscopy result shows
that Cu-Cu distance along the c-axis within the double layers can be very short
(2.5 A), even shorter than metallic elemental copper bond (2.56 A). The value
of dp over dT for CaCu(2-x)P2 at 300 K is approximately three times larger than
in Ca2Cu6P5, which suggests the likelihood of stronger electron-phonon
coupling. This study shows that the details of Cu-P layers and bonding are

protostars show different chemistries, which can be used to trace their
formation history and physical conditions. The excitation of some molecular
species can also be used to trace these physical conditions, making it possible
to constrain e.g. sources of heating and excitation.
  Aims: To study the range of influence of an intermediate-mass Herbig Be
protostar, and to find what chemical and physical impact feedback effects from
the environment may have on embedded protostars.
  Methods: We follow up on an earlier line survey of the Class 0/I source R CrA
IRS7B in the 0.8 mm window with an unbiased line survey of the same source in
the 1.3 mm window using the APEX telescope. We also study the excitation of the
key species H2CO, CH3OH, and c-C3H2 in a complete sample of the 18 embedded
protostars in the Corona Australis star-forming region. Radiative transfer
models are used to establish abundances of the molecular species.
  Results: We detect line emission from 20 molecular species (32 including
isotopologues) in the two surveys. The most complex species detected are CH3OH,
CH3CCH, CH3CHO, and CH3CN. Several complex organics are significantly
under-abundant in comparison with ""hot corino"" protostars. The H2CO
temperatures of the sources in the region decrease with the distance to the
Herbig Be star R CrA, whereas the c-C3H2 temperatures remain constant across
the star-forming region.
  Conclusions: The high H2CO temperatures observed towards objects close to R
CrA suggest that this star has a sphere of influence of several 10000 AU in
which it increases the temperature of the molecular gas to 30-50 K through
irradiation. The chemistry in the IRS7B envelope differs significantly from
many other embedded protostars, which could be an effect of the external
irradiation from R CrA.

frame of the jet, form primarily perpendicular to the direction of the flow, as
the jet dissipates its energy at a large emission radius. This yields two
robust features. First, the emission is significantly delayed compared with the
isotropic case. This delay allows for the peak of the afterglow emission to
appear while the source is still active, in contrast to the simplest isotropic
model. Secondly, the flux decline after the source turns off is steeper than
the isotropic case. We find that these two features are realized in gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs): 1. The peak of most GeV light curves (ascribed to the external
shock) appears during the prompt emission phase. 2. Many X-ray light curves
exhibit a period of steep decay, which is faster than that predicted by the
standard isotropic case. The gamma-ray generation mechanism in GRBs, and
possibly in other relativistic flows, may therefore be anisotropic.

variations in the intergalactic Lyman-alpha opacity that grow rapidly with
redshift at z>5, far in excess of expectations from empirically motivated
models. Previous studies have attempted to explain this excess with spatial
fluctuations in the ionizing background, but found that this required either
extremely rare sources or problematically low values for the mean free path of
ionizing photons. Here we report that much -- or potentially all -- of the
observed excess likely arises from residual spatial variations in temperature
that are an inevitable byproduct of a patchy and extended reionization process.
The amplitude of opacity fluctuations generated in this way depends on the
timing and duration of reionization. If the entire excess is due to temperature
variations alone, the observed fluctuation amplitude favors a late-ending but
extended reionization process that was roughly half complete by z~9 and that
ended at z~6. In this scenario, the highest opacities occur in regions that
reionized earliest, since they have had the most time to cool, while the lowest
opacities occur in the warmer regions that reionized most recently. This
correspondence potentially opens a new observational window into patchy
reionization.

star-forming galaxies (SFGs) across their main sequence (MS) in the plane of
star-formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass. We relate them to the evolution
of galaxies through phases of gas compaction, depletion, possible
replenishment, and eventual quenching. We find that the high-SFR galaxies in
the upper envelope of the MS are compact, with high gas fractions and short
depletion times (""blue nuggets""), while the lower-SFR galaxies in the lower
envelope have lower central gas densities, lower gas fractions and longer
depletion times, consistent with observed gradients across the MS.
Stellar-structure gradients are negligible. The SFGs oscillate about the MS
ridge on timescales $\sim0.4~t_{\mathrm{Hubble}}$ ($\sim1$ Gyr at $z\sim3$).
The propagation upwards is due to gas compaction, triggered, e.g., by mergers,
counter-rotating streams, and/or violent disc instabilities. The downturn at
the upper envelope is due to central gas depletion by peak star formation and
outflows while inflow from the shrunken gas disc is suppressed. An upturn at
the lower envelope can occur once the extended disc has been replenished by
fresh gas and a new compaction can be triggered, namely as long as the
replenishment time is shorter than the depletion time. The mechanisms of gas
compaction, depletion and replenishment confine the SFGs to the narrow
($\pm0.3$ dex) MS. Full quenching occurs in massive haloes
($M_{\mathrm{vir}}>10^{11.5}~M_\odot$) and/or at low redshifts ($z<3$), where
the replenishment time is long compared to the depletion time, explaining the
observed bending down of the MS at the massive end.

investigated within the framework of minimal supergravity. It is shown that
models with light stops which are also consistent with the thermal relic
density constraints require stop coannihilation with the neutralino LSP. The
analysis shows that the residual set of parameter points with light stops
satisfying both the Higgs mass and the relic density constraints lie within a
series of thin strips in the $m_0-m_{1/2}$ plane for different values of
$A_0/m_0$. Consequently, this region of minimal supergravity parameter space
makes a number of very precise predictions. It is found that light stops of
mass down to 400~GeV or lower can exist consistent with all constraints. A
signal analysis for this class of models at LHC RUN-II is carried out and the
dominant signals for their detection identified. Also computed is the minimum
integrated luminosity for $5\sigma$ discovery of the models analyzed. If
supersymmetry is realized in this manner, the stop masses can be as low as
400~GeV or lower, and the mass gap between the lightest neutralino and lightest
stop will be approximately 30-40~GeV. We have optimized the ATLAS signal
regions specifically for stop searches in the parameter space and find that a
stop with mass $\sim 375\,{\rm GeV}$ can be discovered with as little as $\sim$
60~fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity at RUN-II of the LHC; the integrated
luminosity needed for discovery could be further reduced with more efficient
signature analyses. The direct detection of dark matter in this class of models
is also discussed. It is found that dark matter cross sections lie close to,

stream becomes unbound for binary mass ratios 0.06 < q < 0.8. For synchronous
binaries with non-degenerate components, the spiral-stream arms merge at a
radius of ~10a, where a is the binary semi-major axis, and the accompanying
shock thermalizes about 10% of the kinetic power of the outflow. The
mass-losing binary outflows produce luminosities reaching up to ~10^6 L_Sun and
effective temperatures spanning 500 < T_eff < 6000 K, which is compatible with
many of the class of recently-discovered red transients such as V838 Mon and

global cooling transition. The appearance of the transient is viewing
angle-dependent due to vastly different optical depths parallel and
perpendicular to the binary plane. We predict a correlation between the peak

space-time hierarchical-graph based scheme exhibiting fast convergence is
proposed for localizing the agent nodes. In contrast to conventional methods,
agent nodes are divided into different layers with the aid of the space-time

an information propagation rule is conceived upon considering the quality of
positional information. According to the rule, the information always
propagates from the upper layers to a certain lower layer and the message
passing process is further optimized at each layer. Hence, the potential error
propagation can be mitigated. Additionally, both position estimation and
position broadcasting are carried out by the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a
sensor activation mechanism is conceived, which is capable of significantly
reducing both the energy consumption and the network traffic overhead incurred
by the localization process. The analytical and numerical results provided

harassment on early-type dwarfs consisting of 168 different orbits within a
realistic, Virgo-like cluster, varying in eccentricity and pericentre distance.
We find harassment is only effective at stripping stars or truncating their
stellar disks for orbits that enter deep into the cluster core. Comparing to
the orbital distribution in cosmological simulations, we find that the majority
of the orbits (more than three quarters) result in no stellar mass loss. We
also study the effects on the radial profiles of the globular cluster systems
of early-type dwarfs. We find these are significantly altered only if
harassment is very strong. This suggests that perhaps most early-type dwarfs in
clusters such as Virgo have not suffered any tidal stripping of stars or
globular clusters due to harassment, as these components are safely embedded
deep within their dark matter halo. We demonstrate that this result is actually
consistent with an earlier study of harassment of dwarf galaxies, despite the
apparent contradiction. Those few dwarf models that do suffer stellar stripping
are found out to the virial radius of the cluster at redshift=0, which mixes
them in with less strongly harassed galaxies. However when placed on
phase-space diagrams, strongly harassed galaxies are found offset to lower
velocities compared to weakly harassed galaxies. This remains true in a
cosmological simulation, even when halos have a wide range of masses and

composition is studied within a relativistic mean-field approach with hadron
masses and coupling constants depending self-consistently on the scalar
mean-field. All hadron masses decrease universally with the scalar field
growth, whereas meson-nucleon coupling constants can vary differently. More
specifically we focus on two modifications of the KVOR model studied
previously. One extension of the model (KVORcut) demonstrates that the equation
of state stiffens if the increase of the scalar-field magnitude with the
density is bounded from above at some value for baryon densities above the
saturation nuclear density. This can be realized if the nucleon vector-meson
coupling constant changes rapidly as a function of the scalar field slightly
above the desired value. The other version of the model (MKVOR) utilizes a
smaller value of the nucleon effective mass at the nuclear saturation density
and a saturation of the scalar field in the isospin asymmetric matter induced
by a strong variation of the nucleon isovector-meson coupling constant as
function of the scalar field. A possibility of hyperonization of the matter in
neutron star interiors is incorporated. Our equations of state fulfill majority
of known empirical constraints including the pressure-density constraint from
heavy-ion collisions, direct Urca constraint, gravitational-baryon mass
constraint for the pulsar J0737-3039B, and the constraint on the maximum mass
of the neutron stars.

  Our proof applies to free and superrenormalizable bosonic field theories, and
to any points that lie on stationary null surfaces. An example is Minkowski

$S_\text{out}^{\prime\prime}$ can be defined by deforming $\Sigma$ along $N$,

single-dish studies, ruling out the presence of a large envelope. Assuming that
the dust is optically thin, we derive disk dust masses of $2\times

denser gas tracer HCO$^{+}$ peaks close to the position of the southern binary

This suggests that the southern binary component is embedded in denser

fixed points of the renormalization group. We begin with disorder in free field
theories. Imry and Ma showed that disordered free fields can only exist for
d>4. For d>4 we show that disorder leads to new fixed points which are not
scale-invariant. We then move on to large-N theories (vector models or gauge
theories in the `t Hooft limit). We compute exactly the beta function for the

the results of Imry and Ma by showing that such disordered theories exist only
when disorder couples to operators of dimension \Delta > d/4. Sometimes the
disordered fixed points are not scale-invariant, and in other cases they have
unconventional dependence on the disorder, including non-trivial effects due to
irrelevant operators. Holography maps disorder in conformal theories to
stochastic differential equations in a higher-dimensional space. We use this
dictionary to reproduce our field theory results. We also study the leading 1/N
corrections, both by field theory methods and by holography. These corrections
are particularly important when disorder scales with the number of degrees of

still dominate when the ratio N/f increases, also in the stratified case,

unsteady streaming flow is obtained by averaging the time-dependent velocity
field over one oscillation period, and as time increases, it is shown to
converge towards the well-known steady time-averaged solution calculated in the
frequency domain. Scaling analysis reveals that the acoustic resonance builds
up much faster than the acoustic streaming, implying that the radiation force
may dominate over the drag force from streaming even for small particles.
However, our numerical time-dependent analysis indicates that pulsed actuation
does not reduce streaming significantly due to its slow decay. Our analysis
also shows that for an acoustic resonance with a quality factor Q, the
amplitude of the oscillating second-order velocity component is Q times larger
than the usual second-order steady time-averaged velocity component.
Consequently, the well-known criterion v << c for the validity of the
perturbation expansion is replaced by the more restrictive criterion v << c/Q.

a large, multidimensional parameter space by combining multistate reweighting
analysis with a linear basis function approach. This approach reduces the
computational cost to estimate thermodynamic properties from molecular
simulations for over 130,000 tested parameter combinations from over a thousand
CPU years to tens of CPU days. This speed increase is achieved primarily by
computing the potential energy as a linear combination of basis functions,
computed from either modified simulation code or as the difference of energy
between two reference states, which can be done without any simulation code
modification. The thermodynamic properties are then estimated with the
Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) as a function of multiple model
parameters without the need to define a priori how the states are connected by
a pathway. Instead, we adaptively sample a set of points in parameter space to
create mutual configuration space overlap. The existence of regions of poor
configuration space overlap are detected by analyzing the eigenvalues of the
sampled states' overlap matrix. The configuration space overlap to sampled
states is monitored alongside the mean and maximum uncertainty to determine
convergence, as neither the uncertainty or the configuration space overlap
alone is a sufficient metric of convergence.
  This adaptive sampling scheme is demonstrated by estimating with high
precision the solvation free energies of charged particles of Lennard-Jones
plus Coulomb functional form. We also compute entropy, enthalpy, and radial
distribution functions of unsampled parameter combinations using only the data
from these sampled states and use the free energies estimates to examine the
deviation of simulations from the Born approximation to the solvation free
energy.

for testing its deep rift with classical physics, while also providing a key
resource for quantum technologies such as quantum computation and cryptography.
In 1987 Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger realized that the entanglement of
more than two particles implies a non-statistical conflict between local
realism and quantum mechanics. The resulting predictions were experimentally
confirmed by entangling three photons in their polarization. Experimental
efforts since have singularly focused on increasing the number of particles
entangled, while remaining in a two-dimensional space for each particle. Here
we show the experimental generation of the first multi-photon entangled state
where both $-$ the number of particles and the number of dimensions $-$ are
greater than two. Interestingly, our state exhibits an asymmetric entanglement
structure that is only possible when one considers multi-particle entangled
states in high dimensions. Two photons in our state reside in a
three-dimensional space, while the third lives in two dimensions. Our method
relies on combining two pairs of photons, high-dimensionally entangled in their
orbital angular momentum, in such a way that information about their origin is
erased. Additionally, we show how this state enables a new type of ""layered""
quantum cryptographic protocol where two parties share an additional layer of
secure information over that already shared by all three parties. In addition
to their application in novel quantum communication protocols, such asymmetric
entangled states serve as a manifestation of the complex dance of correlations
that can exist within quantum mechanics.

  The first problem revolves around geometric spanners. Here, we have a set of
points in the plane and we want to connect them with straight line segments,
such that there is a path between each pair of points that does not make a
large detour. If we achieve this, the resulting graph is called a spanner. We
focus our attention on $\Theta$-graphs, which are constructed by connecting
each point with its nearest neighbour in a fixed number of cones. Although this
construction is very straight-forward, it has proven challenging to fully
determine the properties of the resulting graphs. We show that if the
construction uses 5 cones, the resulting graphs are still spanners. This was
the only number of cones for which this question remained unanswered. We also
present a routing strategy on the half-$\Theta_6$-graph, a variant of the graph
with 6 cones. We show that our routing strategy finds a path whose length is at
most a constant factor from the straight-line distance between the endpoints.
Moreover, we show that this routing strategy is optimal.
  In the second part, we turn our attention to flips in triangulations. A flip
is a simple operation that transforms one triangulation into another. It turns
out that with enough flips, we can transform any triangulation into any other.
But how many flips is enough? We present an improved upper bound of $5.2n -
33.6$ on the maximum flip distance between any pair of triangulations with n
vertices. Along the way, we prove matching lower bounds on each step in the
current algorithm, including a tight bound of $(3n - 9)/5$ flips needed to make
a triangulation 4-connected. In addition, we prove tight $\Theta(n \log n)$
bounds on the number of flips required in several settings where the edges have
unique labels.

it uses a consistent univariate filter to detect and eliminate extreme cellwise
outliers; second, it applies a robust estimator of multivariate location and
scatter to the filtered data to down-weight casewise outliers; third, it
computes robust regression coefficients from the estimates obtained in the
second step. The three-step estimator is shown to be consistent and
asymptotically normal at the central model under some assumptions on the tail
distributions of the continuous covariates. The estimator is extended to handle
both numerical and dummy covariates using an iterative algorithm. Extensive
simulation results show that the three-step estimator is resilient to cellwise
outliers. It also performs well under casewise contaminations when comparing

diffusional Nabarro-Herring creep. These exponents are observed in the presence
of significant stress-assisted diffusive grain boundary migration, indicating
that Nabarro-Herring creep and stress-assisted boundary migration contribute in
the same manner to the macroscopic constitutive relation. When plastic response
is dislocation-mediated, power law stress exponents inferred from dislocation
climb rates are found to increase monotonically from $m \simeq 3$, as expected
for generic climb-mediated natural creep, to $m \simeq 5.8$ as the dislocation
density $\rho_d$ is increased beyond typical experimental values. Stress
exponents $m \gtrsim 3$ directly measured from simulations that include
dislocation nucleation, climb, glide, and annihilation are attributed primarily
to these large $\rho_d$ effects. Extrapolation to lower $\rho_d$ suggests that
$m \simeq 4-4.5$ should be obtained from our PFC description at typical
experimental $\rho_d$ values, which is consistent with expectations for power
law creep via mixed climb and glide. The anomalously large stress exponents
observed in our atomistic simulations at large $\rho_d$ may nonetheless be
relevant to systems in which comparable densities are obtained locally within
heterogeneous defect domains such as dislocation cell walls or tangles.

of atmospheric numerical models has increased substantially. With the use of
next-generation supercomputers, atmospheric simulations using horizontal grid
intervals of O(100) m or less will gain popularity. At such high resolution
more of the steep gradients in mountainous terrain will be resolved, which may
result in large truncation errors in those models using terrain-following
coordinates. In this study, a new 3D Cartesian coordinate non-hydrostatic
atmospheric model is developed. A cut-cell representation of topography based
on finite-volume discretization is combined with a cell-merging approach, in
which small cut-cells are merged with neighboring cells either vertically or
horizontally. In addition, a block-structured mesh-refinement technique is
introduced to achieve a variable resolution on the model grid with the finest
resolution occurring close to the terrain surface. The model successfully
reproduces a flow over a 3D bell-shaped hill that shows a good agreement with
the flow predicted by the linear theory. The ability of the model to simulate
flows over steep terrain is demonstrated using a hemisphere-shaped hill where
the maximum slope angle is resolved at 71 degrees. The advantage of a locally
refined grid around a 3D hill, with cut-cells at the terrain surface, is also
demonstrated using the hemisphere-shaped hill. The model reproduces smooth
mountain waves propagating over varying grid resolution without introducing
large errors associated with the change of mesh resolution. At the same time,
the model shows a good scalability on a locally refined grid with the use of
OpenMP.

consists of a conservative van der Waals component and a non-conservative
Rontgen component. On physical grounds, the former corresponds to the
velocity-dependent recoil experienced by the excited atom in the processes of
absorption and emission of the photons that it exchanges with the ground state
atoms on a periodic basis. The latter corresponds to the time-variation of the
Rontgen momentum, which is also mediated by the periodic exchange of
quasi-resonant photons. We find that, at leading order, all these interactions
are linear in the velocity. In the non-retarded regime the van der Waals force
dominates, being antiparallel to the velocity. On the contrary, in the retarded
regime the velocity-dependent forces oscillate in space, van der Waals and
Rontgen forces are of the same order in the atom-atom interaction, and the

  a new black hole candidate","15 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stv1869",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report the detection of steady radio emission from the known X-ray source
X9 in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. With a double-peaked C IV emission line in
its ultraviolet spectrum providing a clear signature of accretion, this source
had been previously classified as a cataclysmic variable. In deep ATCA imaging
from 2010 and 2013, we identified a steady radio source at both 5.5 and 9.0
GHz, with a radio spectral index (defined as $S_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha}$) of
$\alpha=-0.4\pm0.4$. Our measured flux density of $42\pm4$ microJy/beam at 5.5
GHz implies a radio luminosity ($\nu L_{\nu}$) of 5.8e27 erg/s, significantly
higher than any previous radio detection of an accreting white dwarf.
Transitional millisecond pulsars, which have the highest radio-to-X-ray flux
ratios among accreting neutron stars (still a factor of a few below accreting
black holes at the same X-ray luminosity), show distinctly different patterns
of X-ray and radio variability than X9. When combined with archival X-ray
measurements, our radio detection places 47 Tuc X9 very close to the
radio/X-ray correlation for accreting black holes, and we explore the
possibility that this source is instead a quiescent stellar-mass black hole
X-ray binary. The nature of the donor star is uncertain; although the
luminosity of the optical counterpart is consistent with a low-mass main
sequence donor star, the mass transfer rate required to produce the high
quiescent X-ray luminosity of 1e33 erg/s suggests the system may instead be
ultracompact, with an orbital period of order 25 minutes. This is the fourth
quiescent black hole candidate discovered to date in a Galactic globular
cluster, and the only one with a confirmed accretion signature from its
optical/ultraviolet spectrum.

ascribes to neocortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus distinct network functions.
The model allows us to analyze whole brain system set point measures, such as
the rate and heterogeneity of transitions in striatum and neocortex, in the
context of disease perturbations. Our closed-loop model invokes different forms
of plasticity at specific tissue interfaces and their principle cell synapses
to achieve these transitions. By modulating information based exchange of
action potentials between modeled neocortical areas, we observe changes to
these measures in simulation. We hypothesize that similar dynamic set points
and modulations exist in the brain's resting state activity, and that germ line
modifications of information based exchange may increase the risk of diseases
such as Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. Disturbances in synaptic
plasticity at distinct tissue interfaces in the model may be used to estimate
risks of system dysfunction and neuronal cell death from quantitative analyses
of the global dynamics that maintain system set points. The model is targeted
for further development using IBM's Neural Tissue Simulator, which allows
scalable elaboration of networks, tissues, and their neural and synaptic
components towards ever greater complexity and biological realism. Elaboration
of these simulations within each modeled neural tissue allows in silico study
of therapeutic interventions in living brain tissue.

slowest form features of human objects movements in the ventral stream.
Applying incremental slow feature analysis provides an opportunity to use the

tetrahedral chains provide key contributions to the preferred ground state. We
show the bulk ground state structure is retained in the ferrates over a range
of strain values; however, a change in the orientation of the tetrahedral
chains, i.e., a perpendicular orientation of the vacancies relative to the
substrate, is stabilized in the compressive region. The structure stability
under strain is largely governed by maximizing the intraplane separation of the
`dipoles' generated from rotations of the FeO$_4$ tetrahedra. Lastly, we find
that the electronic band gap is strongly influenced by strain, manifesting as
an unanticipated asymmetric-vacancy alignment dependent response. This
atomistic understanding establishes a practical route for the design of novel

distributed optimization methods based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). By formulating the learning problem as a consensus problem,
the ADMM can be used to solve the consensus problem in a fully parallel fashion
over a computer network with a star topology. However, traditional synchronized
computation does not scale well with the problem size, as the speed of the
algorithm is limited by the slowest workers. This is particularly true in a
heterogeneous network where the computing nodes experience different
computation and communication delays. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous
distributed ADMM (AD-AMM) which can effectively improve the time efficiency of
distributed optimization. Our main interest lies in analyzing the convergence
conditions of the AD-ADMM, under the popular partially asynchronous model,
which is defined based on a maximum tolerable delay of the network.
Specifically, by considering general and possibly non-convex cost functions, we
show that the AD-ADMM is guaranteed to converge to the set of
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points as long as the algorithm parameters are chosen
appropriately according to the network delay. We further illustrate that the
asynchrony of the ADMM has to be handled with care, as slightly modifying the
implementation of the AD-ADMM can jeopardize the algorithm convergence, even
under a standard convex setting.

$L_X$) have been found in black hole X-ray binaries. For some sources, they
follow the `original' type of correlation which is described by a single
power-law. Later it was found that some other sources follow a different
correlation consisting of three power-law branches, with each branch having
different power-law indexes. In this work, we explain these two types of
correlation under the coupled accretion--jet model. We attribute the difference
between these two types of sources to the different value of viscosity
parameter $\alpha$. One possible reason for different $\alpha$ is the different
configuration of magnetic field in the accretion material coming from the
companion stars. For the `single power-law' sources, their $\alpha$ is high; so
their accretion is always in the mode of advection-dominated accretion flow
(ADAF) for the whole range of X-ray luminosity. For those `hybrid power-law'
sources, the value of $\alpha$ is small so their accretion mode changes from an
ADAF to a luminous hot accretion flow, and eventually to two-phase accretion as
the accretion rate increases. Because the dependence of radiative efficiency on
the mass accretion rate is different for these three accretion modes, different
power-law indexes in the $L_R--L_X$ correlation are expected. Constraints on
the ratio of the mass loss rate into the jet and the mass accretion rate in the
accretion flow are obtained, which can be tested in future by radiative
magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of jet formation.

been introduced in the definition of the solutions of linear Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs) with a particular application to the wave
equation [Montillet, 2014, doi: 10.1007/s10440-014-9978-9]. To do so, the
author has introduced the notion of energy spaces included in the Schwartz
space $\mathbf{S}^-(\mathbb{R})$. In this model, the key is to look at which
ones of these subspaces are reduced to {0} with the help of energy operators
(and generalized energy operators). It leads to define additional solutions for
a nominated PDE. Beyond that, this work intends to develop the concept of
multiplicity of solutions for a linear PDE through the study of these energy
spaces (i.e. emptiness). The main concept is that the PDE is viewed as a
generator of solutions rather than the classical way of solving the given
equation with a known form of the solutions together with boundary conditions.
The theory is applied to the wave equation with the special case of the
evanescent waves. The work ends with a discussion on another concept, the
duplication of solutions and some applications in a closed cavity.

a versatile approach for solving modern large-scale machine learning and signal

dimension is large, a distributed version of ADMM can be used, which is capable
of distributing the computation load and the data set to a network of computing
nodes. Unfortunately, a direct synchronous implementation of such algorithm
does not scale well with the problem size, as the algorithm speed is limited by
the slowest computing nodes. To address this issue, in a companion paper, we
have proposed an asynchronous distributed ADMM (AD-ADMM) and studied its
worst-case convergence conditions. In this paper, we further the study by
characterizing the conditions under which the AD-ADMM achieves linear
convergence. Our conditions as well as the resulting linear rates reveal the
impact that various algorithm parameters, network delay and network size have
on the algorithm performance. To demonstrate the superior time efficiency of
the proposed AD-ADMM, we test the AD-ADMM on a high-performance computer
cluster by solving a large-scale logistic regression problem.

two-dimensional isentropic elastic flows. This problem has a free boundary and
the boundary is characteristic. A necessary and sufficient condition is
obtained for the linear stability of the rectilinear vortex sheets. More
precisely, it is shown that, besides the stable supersonic zone, the elasticity
exerts an additional stable subsonic zone. A new feature for elastic flow is
found that there is a class of states in the interior of subsonic zone where
the stability of such states is weaker than the stability of other states in
the sense that there is an extra loss of tangential derivatives with respect to
the source terms. This is a new feature which Euler flows do not possess. One
of the difficulties for the elastic flow is that the non-differentiable points
of the eigenvalues may coincide with the roots of the Lopatinskii determinant.
As a result, the Kreiss symmetrization cannot be applied directly. Instead, we
perform an upper triangularization of the system to separate only the outgoing
modes at all points in the frequency space, so that an exact estimate of the
outgoing modes can be obtained. Moreover, all the outgoing modes are shown to
be zero due to the $L^2$-regularity of solutions. The estimates for the
incoming modes can be derived directly from the Lopatinskii determinant. This
new approach avoids the lengthy computation and estimates for the outgoing
modes when Kreiss symmetrization is applied. This method can also be applied to
the Euler flows and MHD flows.

plus the 2-adic valuation of $m$. A recurrence relation is $(\alpha,
\beta)$-Conolly if it has an $(\alpha, \beta)$-Conolly solution sequence. We
discover that Conolly-like sequences often appear as solutions to nested (or
meta-Fibonacci) recurrence relations of the form $A(n) = \sum_{i=1}^k
A(n-s_i-\sum_{j=1}^{p_i} A(n-a_{ij}))$ with appropriate initial conditions. For

changes in the morphologies and kinematics of the stellar and ISM components.
Large amounts of gas and stars are often found to be disturbed or displaced as
tidal debris. This debris then evolves, sometimes forming stars and
occasionally tidal dwarf galaxies. Here we present results from our HI study of
Arp 65, an interacting pair hosting extended HI tidal debris. Aims: In an
effort to understand the evolution of tidal debris produced by interacting
pairs of galaxies, including in situ star and tidal dwarf galaxy formation, we
are mapping HI in a sample of interacting galaxy pairs. The Arp 65 pair is one
of them. Methods: Our resolved HI 21 cm line survey is being carried out using
the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). We used our HI survey data as well
as available SDSS optical, Spitzer infra-red and GALEX UV data to study the
evolution of the tidal debris and the correlation of HI with the star-forming
regions within it. Results: In Arp 65 we see a high impact pre-merger
interaction involving a pair of massive galaxies (NGC 90 and NGC 93) that have
a stellar mass ratio of ~ 1:3. The interaction, which probably occurred ~ 1.0
-- 2.5 $\times$ 10$^8$ yr ago, appears to have displaced a large fraction of
the HI in NGC 90 (including the highest column density HI) beyond its optical
disk. We also find extended ongoing star formation in the outer disk of NGC 90.
In the major star-forming regions, we find the HI column densities to be ~ 4.7
$\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ or lower. But no signature of star formation was
found in the highest column density HI debris, SE of NGC 90. This indicates
conditions within the highest column density HI debris remain hostile to star
formation and it reaffirms that high HI column densities may be a necessary but
not sufficient criterion for star formation.

depend on the distance between nodes), changing the node layout amounts to
changing one line of code. In addition, consideration and guidelines are given
on PHS order, polynomial degree and stencil size. The main advantages of the
present method are: 1) capturing the basic physics of the problem surprisingly
well, even at very coarse resolutions, 2) high-order accuracy without the need

be analyzed by the unified method introduced by Fokas and developed by him and

jump matrices are explicitly given in terms of the three matrix-value spectral
functions $s(k)$,$S(k)$ and $S_L(k)$, which in turn are defined in terms of the
initial values, boundary values at $x=0$ and boundary values at $x=L$,
respectively. However, these spectral functions are not independent, they
satisfy a global relation. Here, we show that the characterization of the
unknown boundary values in terms of the given initial and boundary data is

Also, we show that in the limit when the length of the interval tends to

ultraviolet (EUV), $\alpha_{EUV}$ (defined by $F_{\nu} \sim
\nu^{-\alpha_{EUV}}$ computed between 700\AA\, and 1100\AA\,). Larger
$\overline{Q}$ tends to decrease the EUV emission. This is a curious
relationship because it connects a long term average over $\sim 10^{6}$ years
with an instantaneous measurement of the EUV. The EUV appears to be emitted
adjacent to the central supermassive black hole and the most straightforward
explanation of the correlation is that the EUV emitting region interacts in
real time with the jet launching mechanism. Alternatively stated, the
$\overline{Q}$ - $\alpha_{EUV}$ correlation is a manifestation of a
contemporaneous (real time) jet power, $Q(t)$, correlation with $\alpha_{EUV}$.
In order to explore this possibility, this paper considers the time variability
of the strong radio jet of the quasar 1442+101 that is not aberrated by strong
Doppler enhancement. This high redshift (z = 3.55) quasar is uniquely suited
for this endeavor as the EUV is redshifted into the optical observing window
allowing for convenient monitoring. More importantly, it is bright enough to be
seen through the Lyman forest and its radio flux is strong enough that it has
been monitored frequently. Quasi-simultaneous monitoring (five epochs spanning
$\sim 40$ years) show that increases in $Q(t)$ correspond to decreases in the
EUV as expected.

average symbol error rate (ASER) for general order rectangular QAM and cross
QAM schemes using moment generating function based approach. Derived
expressions are in the form of Lauricella's $(F_D^{(n)}(\cdot),
\Phi_1^{(n)}(\cdot))$ hypergeometric functions which can be numerically
evaluated using either integral or series representation. The obtained ASER
expressions include other mixed fading channel cases addressed in the
literature as special cases such as mixed Hoyt, and Rice fading, mixed
Nakagami-$m$, and Rice fading. We further obtain a simple expression for the
asymptotic ASER, which is useful to determine a factor governing the system
performance at high SNRs, i.e., the diversity order. Additionally, we analyze
the optimal power allocation, which provides a practical design rule to
optimally distribute the total transmission power between the source and the
relay to minimize the ASER. Extensive numerical and computer simulation results

be coherently combined, and preventing the use of phase referencing and

results of the analysis provide an empirical demonstration of the increase in
the coherence times at 130 GHz from a few tens of seconds to about twenty
minutes, with FPT, and up to many hours with SFPR. Moreover the astrometric
analysis provides high precision relative position measurements between two

observation is consistent with the absorption-dominated impedance for thick

an appropriate technique to release internal residual stresses. Hence, for
samples containing small amounts of Nb, we observe that CCMA allows us to
suppress the high frequency resonance peak observed in samples containing
as-cast wires. However, for samples containing a high amount of Nb, the high
frequency peak remains despite the CCMA treatment. In this case, the
observation of a two-peak feature in the permittivity spectra is attributed to
the coexistence of the amorphous phase and a small amount of nanocrystallites
distributed at the wire surface. However, due to large magnetostatic energy of
long (35 mm) and short (15 mm) as-cast wires and imperfect wire-epoxy bonding
no shift of the resonance peak and the characteristic double peak of the

thus the phase shift and polarization rotation induced on the guided light by
the trapped atoms. The Green's function is related to a full
Heisenberg-Langevin treatment of the dispersive response of the quantized field
to tensor polarizable atoms. We apply our formalism to quantum nondemolition

detection of atom number for atoms in a completely mixed spin state and the
squeezing of projection noise for atoms in clock states. Compared with
squeezing of atomic ensembles in free space, we capitalize on unique features
that arise in the nanofiber geometry including anisotropy of both the intensity

master equation to model the squeezing as function of time in the presence of

mag. The survey, using the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field spectrograph
(SAMI), comprises observations of galaxies of all morphological types with 75\%
of the sample being early-type galaxies (ETGs) and 25\% being late-type
galaxies (LTGs). Stellar velocity and velocity dispersion maps are derived for
all 106 galaxies in the sample.
  The $\lambda_{R}$ parameter, a proxy for the specific stellar angular
momentum, is calculated for each galaxy in the sample. We find a trend between
$\lambda_{R}$ and galaxy concentration such that LTGs are less concentrated
higher angular momentum systems, with the fast-rotating ETGs (FRs) more
concentrated and lower in angular momentum. This suggests that some dynamical
processes are involved in transforming LTGs to FRs, though a significant
overlap between the $\lambda_{R}$ distributions of these classes of galaxies
implies that this is just one piece of a more complicated picture.
  We measure the kinematic misalignment angle, $\Psi$, for the ETGs in the
sample, to probe the intrinsic shapes of the galaxies. We find the majority of
FRs (83\%) to be aligned, consistent with them being oblate spheroids (i.e.
disks). The slow rotating ETGs (SRs), on the other hand, are significantly more
likely to show kinematic misalignment (only 38\% are aligned). This confirms
previous results that SRs are likely to be mildly triaxial systems.

One
forcing is applied at a given large-scale and it injects energy. The other
forcing is applied at all scales belonging to the inertial range and it injects
helicity. In this way we can vary the degree of turbulence helicity from non
helical to maximally helical. We find that increasing the rate of helicity
injection does not change the energy flux. On the other hand the level of total
energy is strongly increased and the energy spectrum gets steeper. The energy
spectrum spans from a Kolmogorov scaling law $k^{-5/3}$ for a non-helical
turbulence, to a non-Kolmogorov scaling law $k^{-7/3}$ for a maximally helical
turbulence. In the later case we find that the characteristic time of the
turbulence is not the turnover time but a time based on the helicity injection
rate. We also analyse the results in terms of helical modes decomposition. For
a maximally helical turbulence one type of helical mode is found to be much
more energetic than the other one, by several orders of magnitude. The energy
cascade of the most energetic type of helical mode results from the sum of two
fluxes. One flux is negative and can be understood in terms of a decimated
model. This negative flux is however not sufficient to lead an inverse energy
cascade. Indeed the other flux involving the least energetic type of helical
mode is positive and the largest. The least energetic type of helical mode is
then essential and cannot be neglected.

effect of the tolerance ranges on the braking points in different test cases

varying velocities of the VUT will be added to the model while the vehicle is
approaching a target vehicle. The derived trajectories were used as test cases
for a simulation environment. Selecting interesting test cases and processing

deterministic strategies. Moreover, the corresponding strategies of the optimal

formed a Bose-Einstein condensate in the very early Universe, whose density and
quantum potential can account for the dark matter and dark energy in the
Universe respectively. Here we show that the condensation can also naturally
explain the observed large scale homogeneity and isotropy of the Universe.
Furthermore gravitons continue to fall into their ground state within the
condensate at every epoch, accounting for the observed flatness of space at
cosmological distances scales. Finally, we argue that the density perturbations
due to quantum fluctuations within the condensate give rise to a scale
invariant spectrum. This therefore provides a viable alternative to inflation,
which is not associated with the well-known problems associated with the
latter.

for all values of these parameters. Thus, the complete set of field equations
for the Einstein-Skyrme-Lambda system in the topological sector reduces to a
pair of coupled, autonomous, nonlinear differential equations for the scale
factor and a squashing coefficient. These equations admit analytic bouncing
cosmological solutions in which the universe contracts to a minimum
non-vanishing size, and then expands. A non-trivial byproduct of this solution
is that a minor modification of the construction gives rise to a family of
stationary, regular configurations in General Relativity with negative
cosmological constant supported by an SU(2) nonlinear sigma model. These

demonstrating that Nova Sco 2015 is a symbiotic system containing a giant

giant donors, Nova Sco 2015 is shown to be only the third classical nova to be
found with a giant secondary. The evidence for the symbiotic nature is
three-fold; first is the presence of a strong decelerative shock accompanying
the passage of the nova's ejecta through the giant's wind, second is the
H$\alpha$ excess seen from the system and third is the spectral energy
distribution of the secondary in quiescence typical of a cool late type giant.
The evolution of the strength and shape of the emission line profiles shows
that the ejecta velocity follows a power law decay with time ($t^{-1.13 \pm
0.17}$). A Case B recombination analysis of the H I Brackett lines shows that
these lines are affected by optical depth effects for both the novae. Using
this analysis we make estimates for both the novae of the emission measure
$n_e^2L$, the electron density $n_e$ and the mass of the ejecta.

spin Hall insulators can host robust orbital edge magnetism whenever their
highest occupied Kramers doublet is singly occupied, upgrading the spin edge
current into a charge current. The resulting orbital magnetization scales
linearly with size, outweighing the spin contribution for islands of a few nm

different from Schrodinger electrons in quantum rings. Modelling Bi(111)

currently-assumed trigonal 3-layer stacking periodicity. We report electronic

observed in powder inelastic neutron scattering, in contrast to spin models

spectrum within linear spin wave theory. Our susceptibility measurements on
both powders and stacked crystals, as well as neutron powder diffraction show a

provides evidence for zigzag magnetic order in the honeycomb layers with an
antiferromagnetic stacking between layers. Magnetization measurements on

the Zeeman effect. While Majoranas do not require a presence of only one
dispersion subband, we observe that the size of the Majoranas becomes
unpractically large, and the band gap unpractically small when more than one

Cherenkov angle with altitude, the loss of photons due to scattering and
absorption of Cherenkov light out of the camera field-of-view and the
scattering of photons into the camera. In this scenario, aerosols are the most
variable atmospheric component in time and space and therefore need a
continuous monitoring. Lidars are among the most used instruments in
atmospheric physics to measure the aerosol attenuation profiles of light. The
ARCADE Lidar system is a very compact and portable Raman Lidar system that has
been built within the FIRB 2010 grant and is currently taking data in Lamar,
Colorado. The ARCADE Lidar is proposed to operate at the CTA sites with the
goal of making a first survey of the aerosol conditions of the selected site
and to use it as a calibrated benchmark for the other Lidars that will be
installed on site. It is proposed for CTA that the ARCADE Lidar will be first
upgraded in Italy and then tested in parallel to a Lidar of the EARLINET

in the Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The current sample includes 92 RR
Lyrae-six of them are new identifications-and 20 Anomalous Cepheids, one of
which is new identification. The analysis of the Bailey diagram shows that the
luminosity amplitude of the first overtone component in double-mode variables
is located along the long-period tail of regular first overtone variables,
while the fundamental component is located along the short-period tale of
regular fundamental variables. This evidence further supports the transitional
nature of these objects. Moreover, the distribution of Carina double-mode
variables in the Petersen diagram (P_1/P_0 vs P_0) is similar to metal-poor
globulars (M15, M68), to the dwarf spheroidal Draco and to the Galactic Halo.
This suggests that the Carina old stellar population is metal-poor and affected
by a small spread in metallicity. We use trigonometric parallaxes for five
field RR Lyrae stars to provide an independent estimate of the Carina distance
using the observed reddening free Period--Wesenheit [PW, (BV)] relation. Theory
and observations indicate that this diagnostic is independent of metallicity.
We found a true distance modulus of \mu=20.01\pm0.02 (standard error of the
mean) \pm0.05 (standard deviation) mag. We also provided independent estimates
of the Carina true distance modulus using four predicted PW relations (BV, BI,
VI, BVI) and we found: \mu=(20.08\pm0.007\pm0.07) mag,

\mu=(20.06\pm0.006\pm0.06) mag. Finally, we identified more than 100 new SX
Phoenicis stars that together with those already known in the literature (340)
make Carina a fundamental laboratory to constrain the evolutionary and
pulsation properties of these transitional variables.

annealed measure for the magnetization rescaled by $\sqrt{N}$ of Ising models
on random graphs. More precisely, we consider the general rank-1 inhomogeneous
random graph (or generalized random graph), the 2-regular configuration model
and the configuration model with degrees 1 and 2. For the generalized random
graph, we first show the existence of a finite annealed inverse critical
temperature $0 \leq \beta^{\mathrm \scriptscriptstyle an}_c < \infty$ and then
prove our results in the uniqueness regime, i.e., the values of inverse
temperature $\beta$ and external magnetic field $B$ for which either $\beta <
\beta^{\mathrm \scriptscriptstyle an}_c$ and $B=0$, or $\beta>0$ and $B \neq
0$. In the case of the configuration model, the central limit theorem holds in
the whole region of the parameters $\beta$ and $B$, because phase transitions
do not exist for these systems as they are closely related to one-dimensional
Ising models. Our proofs are based on explicit computations that are possible
since the Ising model on the generalized random graph in the annealed setting
is reduced to an inhomogeneous Curie-Weiss model, while the analysis of the
configuration model with degrees only taking values 1 and 2 relies on that of
the classical one-dimensional Ising model.

allow us to detail the synchrotron emission bump in the source spectral energy
distribution (SED). In the optical we found a general bluer-when-brighter
trend. The X-ray spectrum remained stable during 2013, but a comparison with
previous observations suggests that it becomes harder when the X-ray flux
increases. The long XMM-Newton exposure reveals a curved X-ray spectrum. In the
SED, the XMM-Newton data show a hard near-UV spectrum, while Swift data display
a softer shape that is confirmed by previous HST-COS and IUE observations.
Polynomial fits to the optical-X-ray SED show that the synchrotron peak likely
lies in the 4-30 eV energy range, with a general shift towards higher
frequencies for increasing X-ray brightness. However, the UV and X-ray spectra
do not connect smoothly. Possible interpretations include: i) orientation
effects, ii) additional absorption, iii) multiple emission components, and iv)
a peculiar energy distribution of relativistic electrons. We discuss the first

OSIRIS images by the stereo-photoclinometry (SPC) and stereo-photogrammetry
(SPG) techniques. We estimated the tensile, shear, and compressive strengths
using different surface morphologies and mechanical considerations. The
different regions show a similar general pattern in terms of the relation
between gravitational slopes and terrain morphology: i) low-slope terrains
(0-20 deg) are covered by a fine material and contain a few large ($>$10 m) and
isolated boulders, ii) intermediate-slope terrains (20-45 deg) are mainly
fallen consolidated materials and debris fields, with numerous
intermediate-size boulders from $<$1 m to 10 m for the majority of them, and
iii) high-slope terrains (45-90 deg) are cliffs that expose a consolidated
material and do not show boulders or fine materials. The best range for the
tensile strength of overhangs is 3-15 Pa (upper limit of 150 Pa), 4-30 Pa for
the shear strength of fine surface materials and boulders, and 30-150 Pa for
the compressive strength of overhangs (upper limit of 1500 Pa). The
strength-to-gravity ratio is similar for 67P and weak rocks on Earth. As a
result of the low compressive strength, the interior of the nucleus may have
been compressed sufficiently to initiate diagenesis, which could have
contributed to the formation of layers. Our value for the tensile strength is
comparable to that of dust aggregates formed by gravitational instability and
tends to favor a formation of comets by the accrection of pebbles at low

can be represented in arbitrary coordinates using tensor calculus. But the
literature also claims that spinors _as such_ cannot be represented in
coordinates in a curved space-time. These commonplaces are inconsistent, so
what is general covariance for fermions? In fact both commonplaces are wrong.
Ogievetsky and Polubarinov (OP) constructed spinors in coordinates in 1965,
enhancing the unity of physics and helping to spawn nonlinear group
representations. Roughly and locally, OP spinors resemble the orthonormal basis
or tetrad formalism in the symmetric gauge, but they are conceptually
self-sufficient and more economical. The tetrad formalism is thus
de-Ockhamized, with six extra components and six compensating gauge symmetries.
As developed nonperturbatively by Bilyalov, OP spinors admit any coordinates at
a point, but 'time' must be listed first; 'time' is defined by an eigenvalue
problem involving the metric and diag(-1,1,1,1), the product of which must have
no negative eigenvalues. Thus even formal general covariance requires
reconsideration; admissible coordinates should be sensitive to the types and
_values_ of the fields. Apart from coordinate order and the usual spinorial
two-valuedness, (densitized) Ogievetsky-Polubarinov spinors form, with the
(conformal part of the) metric, a nonlinear geometric object, with Lie and
covariant derivatives. The mild consequences of coordinate order are explored
for the conventionality of simultaneity in Special Relativity and the
Schwarzschild solution in General Relativity.

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) aided two-tier heterogeneous networks

multiple eavesdroppers. We first address the impact of massive MIMO on the
maximum receive power based user association. We then derive the tractable
upper bound expressions for the secrecy outage probability of a HetNets user.We
show that the implementation of massive MIMO significantly improves the secrecy
performance, which indicates that physical layer security could be a promising
solution for safeguarding massive MIMO HetNets. Furthermore, we show that the
secrecy outage probability of HetNets user first degrades and then improves
with increasing the density of PBSs.

sensor response were studied and the response to 1000 ppm C2H2 at working
temperature of 370 C reached a value of 106.3, which is much higher than that
of other materials reported. In addition, the carbon-decorated SnO2 sensor
showed very good stability and C2H2 selectivity against other gases. Raman
spectroscopy reveals that the response of sensors is affected by carbon-loading

speculated that the sensor response is enhanced by electron penetration effect
from internal SnO2 nanoparticles to the external carbon layer, due to Schottky

Ref.[$\href{http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v3/n10/full/ncomms2076.html}{Nat.
Commun. {\bf3}, 1092 (2012)}$], the authors have developed a new formalism,
namely, the \emph{process matrix} formalism, which is locally in agreement with
quantum physics but assumes no global causal order. They have further shown
that there exist \emph{non-causal} correlations originating from
\emph{inseparable} process matrices that violate a \emph{causal inequality}
(CI) derived under the assumption that events are ordered with respect to some
global causal relation. This CI can be understood as a guessing game, where two
separate parties, say Alice and Bob, generate random bits (say input bit) in
their respective local laboratories. Bob generates another random bit (say
decision bit) which determines their goal: whether Alice has to guess Bob's bit
or vice-verse. Here we study this causal game but with biased bits and derive a
biased causal inequality (BCI). We then study the possibility of violation of
this BCI by inseparable process matrices. Interestingly, we show that there
exist \emph{inseparable} qubit process matrices that can be used to violate the
BCI for an arbitrary bias in the decision bit. In such scenario, we also derive
the maximal violation of the BCI under local operations involving traceless
binary observables. However, for biased input bits, we find that there is a
threshold bias beyond which no valid qubit process matrix can be used to
violate the causal inequality under \emph{measurement-repreparation} type

matrices which form a rich class of convex bodies that properly contains that
of polyhedra. While the class of polyhedra is closed under linear projections,
the class of spectrahedra is not. In this paper we investigate the problem of
deciding containment of projections of polyhedra and spectrahedra based on
previous works on containment of spectrahedra. The main concern is to study
these containment problems by formulating them as polynomial nonnegativity
problems. This allows to state hierarchies of (sufficient) semidefinite

also extend results on a solitary sufficient condition for containment of
spectrahedra coming from the polyhedral situation as well as connections to the

parameter depends on the single mirror profile and nesting accuracy, but also
on the mirrors surface microroughness that causes X-ray Scattering (XRS). In
particular, owing to its dependence on the photon energy, XRS can dominate the

disk-hosting Herbig Ae/Be stars. We investigate whether the chemical
peculiarity originates in a circumstellar disk. Using a sample of systems for
which both the stellar abundances and the protoplanetary disk structure are
known, we find that stars hosting warm, flaring group I disks typically have
Fe, Mg and Si depletions of 0.5 dex compared to the solar-like abundances of
stars hosting cold, flat group II disks. The volatile, C and O, abundances in
both sets are identical. Group I disks are generally transitional, having
radial cavities depleted in millimetre-sized dust grains, while those of group
II are usually not. Thus we propose that the depletion of heavy elements
emerges as Jupiter-like planets block the accretion of part of the dust, while
gas continues to flow towards the central star. We calculate gas to dust ratios
for the accreted material and find values consistent with models of disk
clearing by planets. Our results suggest that giant planets of ~0.1 to 10 M_Jup

among kin and non-kin, intra- and inter-specific cooperation, co-evolution, the
emergence of symbioses, of social synergies, and the emergence of division of

The observations, while confirming the large-amplitude orbital modulation found
in previous studies after the state change, also reveal an energy dependence of
the amplitudes as well as variations on time scale of months. The amplitude
variations are anti-correlated in the X-ray and the UV/optical bands. The
average X-ray spectrum is described by a power law with \Gamma index of 1.07(8)
without requiring an additional thermal component. The power law index \Gamma
varies from 1.2 to 1.0 between superior and inferior conjunction of the neutron
star. We interpret the observed X-ray behaviour in terms of synchrotron
radiation emitted in an extended intrabinary shock, located between the pulsar
and the donor star, which is eclipsed due to the companion orbital motion. The
G5 type donor dominates the UV/optical and near-IR emission and is similarly
found to be heated up to ? 6500K as in the disc state. The analysis of optical
light curves gives a binary inclination 46 < i < 65deg and a mass ratio 0.11 <
q <0.26. The donor mass is found to be 0.15 < M2 < 0.36Msun for a neutron star
mass of 1.4Msun. The variations in the amplitude of the orbital modulation are
interpreted in terms of small changes in the mass flow rate from the donor
star. The spectral energy distribution from radio to gamma-rays is composed by
multiple contributions that are different from those observed during the

Furthermore, we conceive a new outage-based characterization approach for the

a benchmark. We first derive closed-form expressions of both the connection
outage probability (COP) and of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for both
the TBRS and JRJS schemes. Then, a reliable-and-secure connection probability
(RSCP) is defined and analyzed for characterizing the effect of the correlation
between the COP and SOP introduced by the corporate source-relay link. The
reliability-security ratio (RSR) is introduced for characterizing the
relationship between the reliability and security through the asymptotic
analysis. Moreover, the concept of effective secrecy throughput is defined as
the product of the secrecy rate and of the RSCP for the sake of characterizing
the overall efficiency of the system, as determined by the transmit SNR,
secrecy codeword rate and the power sharing ratio between the relay and jammer.
The impact of the direct source-eavesdropper link and additional performance
comparisons with respect to other related selection schemes are further
included. Our numerical results show that the JRJS scheme outperforms the TBRS
method both in terms of the RSCP as well as in terms of its effective secrecy
throughput, but it is more sensitive to the feedback delays. Increasing the
transmit SNR will not always improve the overall throughput. Moreover, the RSR
results demonstrate that upon reducing the CSI feedback delays, the reliability
improves more substantially than the security degrades, implying an overall
improvement in terms of the security-reliability tradeoff.

zero energy twice inside the valley with odd occupancy. These crossings are
shifted by the phase difference towards the charge degeneracy points,

give rise to resonant peaks in the differential conductance with magnitude
$4e^2/h$. Finally, we demonstrate that the quantum fluctuations of the dot spin

calculating the couplings are in use, from the simple (but inaccurate)
point-dipole approximation to fully quantum-chemical methods. We compared
several approximations to determine their range of applicability, noting that
the propagation of experimental uncertainties poses a fundamental limit on the
achievable accuracy. In particular, the uncertainty in crystallographic
coordinates yields an uncertainty of about 20% in the calculated couplings.
Because quantum-chemical corrections are smaller than 20% in most biologically
relevant cases, their considerable computational cost is rarely justified. We
therefore recommend the electrostatic TrEsp method across the entire range of
molecular separations and orientations because its cost is minimal and it
generally agrees with quantum-chemical calculations to better than the
geometric uncertainty. We also caution against computationally optimizing a
crystal structure before calculating couplings, as it can lead to large,
uncontrollable errors. Understanding the unavoidable uncertainties can guard
against striving for unrealistic precision; at the same time, detailed
benchmarks can allow important qualitative questions--which do not depend on
the precise values of the simulation parameters--to be addressed with greater
confidence about the conclusions.

as the function of both states and stimuli and the previously assumed threshold
evolving equation versus time is naturally deduced from the separatrix. In
terms of neuron dynamics, the threshold voltage variation, which is affected by
different stimuli, is determined by crossing the separatrix at different points
in state space. We suggest that the separatrix-crossing mechanism in state
space is the intrinsic dynamic mechanism for threshold voltages and
post-stimulus threshold phenomena. These proposals are also systematically
verified in example models, three of which have analytic separatrices and one

DSphs are difficult targets for observations because of their small size and
very low surface brightness. Here we measure spectroscopic and photometric
parameters of three candidates for isolated dSphs, KKH65=BTS23, KK180, and
KK227, outside the Local Group. The galaxies are found to be of low metallicity
and low velocity dispersion. They are among the lowest surface brightness
objects in the Local Universe. According to the measured radial velocities,
metallicities, and structural and photometric parameters, KKH65 and KK227 are
representatives of the ultra-diffuse quenched galaxies. KKH65 and KK227 belong
to the outer parts of the groups NGC3414 and NGC5371, respectively. KK180 is
located in the Virgo cluster infall region.

well-conditioned system. Numerical results corroborate the presented theory.

levels define a conformally invariant theory, the so-called regime IV, which
provides the actual description of the (analytically continued) colouring

generating an efficient Graph, called the in-tree (IT). Due to some beautiful
and effective features, this IT structure proves well suited for data
clustering. Although there exist some redundant edges in IT, they usually have
salient features and thus it is not hard to remove them.
  Subsequently, in order to prevent the seemingly redundant edges from
occurring, we proposed the Nearest Neighbor Descent (NND) by adding the
""Neighborhood"" constraint on ND. Consequently, clusters automatically emerged,
without the additional requirement of removing the redundant edges. However,
NND proved still not perfect, since it brought in a new yet worse problem, the
""over-partitioning"" problem.
  Now, in this paper, we propose a method, called the Hierarchical Nearest
Neighbor Descent (H-NND), which overcomes the over-partitioning problem of NND
via using the hierarchical strategy. Specifically, H-NND uses ND to effectively
merge the over-segmented sub-graphs or clusters that NND produces. Like ND,
H-NND also generates the IT structure, in which the redundant edges once again
appear. This seemingly comes back to the situation that ND faces. However,
compared with ND, the redundant edges in the IT structure generated by H-NND
generally become more salient, thus being much easier and more reliable to be
identified even by the simplest edge-removing method which takes the edge
length as the only measure. In other words, the IT structure constructed by
H-NND becomes more fitted for data clustering. We prove this on several
clustering datasets of varying shapes, dimensions and attributes. Besides,
compared with ND, H-NND generally takes less computation time to construct the
IT data structure for the input data.

accounting for the nonclassical counterintuitive contribution of the
backward-moving component of the wave packet attributed to the particle. This
propagator completely resolves the corresponding time-dependent Schr\""odinger

the quantum mechanical effects of a particle reflection from the potential
downward step/well and a particle tunneling through the potential barrier as a
function of time. These results are related to fundamental issues such as
measuring time in quantum mechanics (tunneling time, time of arrival, dwell
time). For imaginary time, which represents an inverse temperature
$(t\rightarrow-i{\hbar}/k_{B}T)$, the obtained propagator is equivalent to the
density matrix for a particle that is in a heat bath and is subject to a
rectangular potential. If one shifts to imaginary time $(t\rightarrow-it)$, the
matrix element of the calculated propagator in the spatial basis provides a
solution to the diffusion-like equation with a rectangular potential. The
obtained exact results are presented as the integrals from elementary functions
and thus allow for a numerical visualization of the probability density

a trait as reported in the NHGRI GWAS Catalog. However, interpreting the
functional roles played by these SNPs remains a challenge. Here we describe an
approach that uses the inherent bipartite structure of eQTL networks to place
SNPs into a functional context.
  Using genotyping and gene expression data from 163 lung tissue samples in a
study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) we calculated eQTL
associations between SNPs and genes and cast significant associations (FDR $<
0.1$) as links in a bipartite network. To our surprise, we discovered that the
highly-connected ""hub"" SNPs within the network were devoid of
disease-associations. However, within the network we identified 35 highly
modular communities, which comprise groups of SNPs associated with groups of
genes; 13 of these communities were significantly enriched for distinct
biological functions (P $ < 5 \times 10^{-4}$) including COPD-related
functions. Further, we found that GWAS-significant SNPs were enriched at the
cores of these communities, including previously identified GWAS associations
for COPD, asthma, and pulmonary function, among others. These results speak to
our intuition: rather than single SNPs influencing single genes, we see groups
of SNPs associated with the expression of families of functionally related
genes and that disease SNPs are associated with the perturbation of those
functions. These methods are not limited in their application to COPD and can
be used in the analysis of a wide variety of disease processes and other
phenotypic traits.

dithiol-terminated oligo(phenylene-ethynylenes) (OPEs) containing various
central units. Uniquely, one molecule of this family possesses a conjugated
acene-based central backbone attached via triple bonds to terminal sulfur atoms
bound to gold electrodes and incorporates a fully conjugated hydroquinone
central unit. We demonstrate that both S and the electronic contribution ZelT
to the figure of merit ZT can be dramatically enhanced by oxidizing the
hydroquinone to yield a second molecule, which possesses a cross-conjugated
anthraquinone central unit. This enhancement originates from the conversion of
the pi-conjugation in the former to cross-conjugation in the latter, which
promotes the appearance of a sharp anti-resonance at the Fermi energy.
Comparison with thermoelectric properties of the remaining seven conjugated
molecules demonstrates that such large values of S and ZelT are unprecedented.
We also evaluate the phonon contribution to the thermal conductance, which
allows us to compute the full figure of merit ZT = ZelT/(1 +

thermal conductance and \k{appa}el is the electronic contribution. For

Nevertheless, direct measurements of individual vessel segments have been

time consuming, and technically difficult. We developed software that extracts
the length, radius, and connectivity of in vivo vessels from contrast-enhanced

calculated scaling exponents by four methods--two derived from local properties

methods are often used interchangeably in the literature, we do not find
general agreement between these methods, particularly for vessel lengths.
Measurements for length of vessels also diverge from theoretical values, but
those for radius show stronger agreement. Our results demonstrate that vascular

evolution and the age of the Sun as a proxy. To do this we created a galactic
chemical evolution model and applied the following habitability constraints to
the Sun-like (G-type) stars formed in our model: an environment free from
life-extinguishing supernovae, a high enough metallicity for Earth-sized planet
formation and sufficient time for the evolution of complex life. We determined
a galactic habitable zone as the region containing all the potentially
habitable star systems in our model. Our galactic habitable zone contains stars
formed between 11 and 3.8 billion years ago at radial distances of between 7
and 14 kiloparsecs. We found that most potentially habitable star systems are
much older than the Sun and located farther from the galactic centre. By
comparing the ages of these systems we estimated that 77% of potentially
habitable star systems are on average 3.13 billion years older than the Sun.
This suggests that any intelligent life in the Galaxy is likely to be
incredibly more advanced than we are assuming that they have evolved under
similar timescales than we have. Implications and limitations of our study are
discussed.

Unlike Nordstr\""om's ""massless"" theory, massive scalar gravity is invariant
under the Poincar\'e group but not the 15-parameter conformal group. It thus
exhibits the whole Minkowski space-time structure, indirectly for volumes.
Massive scalar gravity is plausible as a field theory, but violates Einstein's
principles of general covariance, general relativity, equivalence, and Mach.
Geometry is a poor guide: matter sees a conformally flat metric due to
universal coupling, but gravity sees the rest of the flat metric (on long
distances) in the mass term. What is the `true' geometry, in line with
Poincar\'e's modal conventionality argument? Infinitely many theories exhibit
this bimetric `geometry,' all with the total stress-energy's trace as source;
geometry does not explain the field equations. The irrelevance of the
Ehlers-Pirani-Schild construction to conventionalism is evident given
multi-geometry theories. As Seeliger envisaged, the smooth massless limit
yields underdetermination between massless and massive scalar gravities---an
unconceived alternative. One version easily could have been developed before
GR; it would have motivated thinking of Einstein's equations along the lines of
his newly reappreciated ""physical strategy"" and suggested a rivalry from
massive spin 2 for GR (massless spin 2, Pauli-Fierz 1939). The
Putnam-Gr\""unbaum debate on conventionality is revisited given a broad modal
scope. Massive scalar gravity licenses a historically plausible rational
reconstruction of much of space-time philosophy in light of particle physics.
An appendix reconsiders the Malament-Weatherall-Manchak conformal restriction
of conventionality and constructs the `universal force' in the null cones.

Different laws for the exchange term represent equilibrium and non-equilibrium

nontensorial objects under 4D frame rotations is found to be both unnecessary
and confusing. As traditionally used in ED, a vector potential $A$ always
transforms homogeneously under 4D rotations in spacetime, but if the gauge is
changed by the rotation, one can restore the gauge back to the original gauge
by adding an inhomogeneous term. It is then ""not a 4-vector"", but two: one for
rotation and one for translation. For such a gauge, it is much more important
to preserve {\it explicit} homogeneous Lorentz covariance by simply skipping
the troublesome gauge-restoration step. A gauge-independent separation of $A$
into a dynamical term and a non-dynamical term in Abelian gauge theories is
re-defined more generally as the terms caused by the presence and absence
respectively of the 4-current term in the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations for
$A$. Such a separation {\it cannot} in general be extended to non-Abelian
theories where $A$ satisfies nonlinear differential equations. However, in the
linearized iterative solution that is perturbation theory, the usual Abelian
quantizations in the usual gauges can be used. Some nonlinear complications are

analysis of resting state fMRI from a 242-subject subset of the IMAGEN project,
a European study of adolescents that includes longitudinal phenotypic,
behavioral, genetic, and neuroimaging data. NFM employs a computational
technique inspired by biological evolution to discover and mathematically
characterize interactions among ROI (regions of interest), without making
linear or univariate assumptions. We show that statistics of the resulting
interaction relationships comport with recent independent work, constituting a
preliminary cross-validation. Furthermore, nonlinear terms are ubiquitous in
the models generated by NFM, suggesting that some of the interactions
characterized here are not discoverable by standard linear methods of analysis.
We discuss one such nonlinear interaction in the context of a direct comparison
with a procedure involving pairwise correlation, designed to be an analogous
linear version of functional mapping. We find another such interaction that
suggests a novel distinction in brain function between drinking and
non-drinking adolescents: a tighter coupling of ROI associated with emotion,
reward, and interoceptive processes such as thirst, among drinkers. Finally, we
outline many improvements and extensions of the methodology to reduce
computational expense, complement other analytical tools like graph-theoretic
analysis, and allow for voxel level NFM to eliminate the necessity of ROI
