Newtonian stars is presented, focusing on polar modes. Due to the
Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz mechanism, the f-mode (fundamental oscillation)
is driven unstable by the emission of gravitational waves. If the star falls
inside the so-called instability window, the mode's amplitude grows
exponentially, until it is halted by nonlinear effects. Quadratic perturbations
form three-mode networks inside the star, which evolve as coupled oscillators,
exchanging energy. Coupling of the unstable f-mode to other (stable) modes can
lead to a parametric resonance and the subsequent saturation of its amplitude,
thus suppressing the instability. The saturation point determines the amplitude
of the gravitational-wave signal obtained from an individual source, as well as
the evolutionary path of the latter inside the instability window.

guarantees positivity and mass conservation --- the main feature of our
discretization is that it dissipates both the Dirichlet energy and the
logarithmic entropy. The interplay between these two dissipations paves the way

followings. First, we propose a variational Bayesian framework for tracking an
unknown and varying number of persons. Second, our model results in a
variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm with closed-form
expressions for the posterior distributions of the latent variables and for the
estimation of the model parameters. Third, the proposed model exploits
observations from multiple detectors, and it is therefore multimodal by nature.
Finally, we propose to embed both object-birth and object-visibility processes
in an effort to robustly handle person appearances and disappearances over

shows competitive results with respect to state-of-the-art multiple-object

the imaginary time direction appearing in the path integral representation of
the state. The location of the physical index is considered as an impurity in

dynamical impurity correlations. Coarse-graining the transfer matrix is

combining ideas of MPS and the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz.

verify the impurity interpretation of MPS compression, as put forward by [V.

describe elementary excitations on top of the ground state, which serves to
elucidate a transparent renormalization group structure ingrained in MPS
descriptions of ground states.

a direct measurement of the surface rotation at active latitudes, for three

identify the main populations of these samples and interpret their main biases
specifically for a comparison with the solar Prot. Prot and variability
amplitude (A) measurements were obtained from public CoRoT and Kepler catalogs
combined with physical parameters. Because these samples are subject to
selection effects, we computed synthetic samples with simulated biases to
compare with observations, particularly around the location of the Sun in the
HR diagram. Theoretical grids and empirical relations were used to combine
physical parameters with Prot and A. Biases were simulated by performing
cutoffs on the physical and rotational parameters in the same way as in each
observed sample. A crucial cutoff is related with the detectability of the
rotational modulation, which strongly depends on A. The synthetic samples
explain the observed Prot distributions of Sun-like stars as having two main
populations: one of young objects (group I, with ages younger than ~1 Gyr) and
another of MS and evolved stars (group II, with ages older than ~1 Gyr). The
proportions of groups I and II in relation to the total number of stars range
within 64-84% and 16-36%, respectively. Hence, young objects abound in the
distributions, producing the effect of observing a high number of short periods
around the location of the Sun in the HR diagram. Differences in the Prot
distributions between the CoRoT and Kepler Sun-like samples may be associated
with different Galactic populations. Overall, the synthetic distribution around
the solar period agrees with observations, which suggests that the solar
rotation is normal with respect to Sun-like stars within the accuracy of
current data.

celebrated the Hiding Hand, which he saw as a benevolent mechanism by which
unrealistically optimistic planners embark on unexpectedly challenging plans,
only to be rescued by human ingenuity, which they could not anticipate, but
which ultimately led to success, principally in the form of unexpectedly high
net benefits. Studying eleven projects, Hirschman suggested that the Hiding
Hand is a general phenomenon. But the Benevolent Hiding Hand has an evil twin,
the Malevolent Hiding Hand, which blinds excessively optimistic planners not
only to unexpectedly high costs but also to unexpectedly low net benefits.
Studying a much larger sample than Hirschman did, we find that the Malevolent
Hiding Hand is common and that the phenomenon that Hirschman identified is
rare. This sobering finding suggests that Hirschman's phenomenon is a special
case; it attests to the pervasiveness of the planning fallacy, writ very large.
One implication involves the continuing need for unbiased cost-benefit analyses
and other economic decision support tools; another is that such tools might
sometimes prove unreliable.

has a real eigenvalue-eigenvector pair. The corresponding statement for complex

when n is again odd. Derksen uses this result in an induction chain to prove
the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra using matrix representations. In fact the
question is closely tied to topological issues. We discuss proofs coming from
vector field theory and characteristic classes. But a new proof uses rather
elementary constructions. A complex linear n-mapping without an eigenvector
gives rise to three real 2n-mappings, such that all transformations (mappings)
in their (non-trivial) linear span have full rank (are linear isomorphisms).
The theory of matrices of fixed rank shows that we obtain a 2n-plane bundle
equation over the real projective plane. The equation states that the sum of
trivial line bundles is essentially the same as the (same rank) sum of Hopf
line bundles. To show that this yields a contradiction makes use of the
homotopy theory of vector bundles over a base of low dimension, the
two-dimensional Borsuk-Ulam theorem, and the invariance of topological degree
for self-mappings of an (embedded) two-sphere in three-space.

the ""external"" time (the time of ambient space) in this approach is
investigated. The transition to the ""external"" time is realized with the help
of partial gauge fixing, the coordinate condition which equates the timelike
coordinate of the surface and time of the ambient space. It is shown that by
using such a gauge condition in the action, the loss of any equations of motion
does not take place, although it can happen in the general case. A version of
the canonical formalism of the theory is studied in which certain additional
constraints are imposed, providing the equivalence of the approach under
consideration and general relativity. The corresponding first-class constraint
algebra is obtained. It is proved that using the gauge directly in the action
leads to the same result as gauge fixing in the constraint algebra, despite the
artificial introduction of some of the constraints into the theory. Application
of the ""external"" time may be useful for attempts to quantize the theory as

Through load-level and grid-level control design, high-quality ancillary
service for the grid is obtained without impacting quality of service delivered
to the consumer. This approach to grid regulation is called demand dispatch:
loads are providing service continuously and automatically, without consumer
interference.
  In this paper we ask, what intelligence is required at the grid-level? In
particular, does the grid-operator require more than one-way communication to
the loads? Our main conclusion: risk is not great in lower frequency ranges,
e.g., PJM's RegA or BPA's balancing reserves. In particular, ancillary services
from refrigerators and pool-pumps can be obtained successfully with only
one-way communication. This requires intelligence at the loads, and much less

changes the energy landscape. Here, we show that the relative importance of the
two processes can be determined by comparing the natural light-harvesting

shows that although supertransfer does enhance the rates somewhat, the

  induced photonic crystal-glass structure by controlling optical path length",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ability to control the light matter interaction and simultaneous tuning
of both structural order and disorder in materials, although are important in
photonics, but still remain as major challenges. In this paper, we show that
optical path length dictates light-matter interaction in the same crystal
structure formed by the ordering of magnetic nanoparticle self-assembled
columns inside magnetic nanofluid under applied field. When the optical path
length (L=80 {\mu}m) is shorter than the optical (for wavelength,
{\lambda}=632.8 nm) coherence length inside the magnetic nanofluid under
applied field, a Debye diffraction ring pattern is observed; while for longer
path length (L=1mm), a corona ring of scattered light is observed. Analysis of
Debye diffraction ring pattern suggests the formation of 3D hexagonal crystal
structure, where the longitudinal and lateral inter-column spacings are 5.281
and 7.344 microns, respectively. Observation of speckles within the Debye
diffraction pattern confirms the presence of certain degree of structural
disorder within the crystal structure, which can be tuned by controlling the
applied field strength, nanoparticle size and particle volume fraction. Our
results provide a new approach to develop next generation of tunable photonic
devices, based on simultaneous harnessing of the properties of disordered
photonic glass and 3D photonic crystal.

universal horizons are Cauchy horizons when evolution depends on boundary data

are forming stars at an average rate of 1.7 $-$ 10 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and
possess Super Massive Black Holes (SMBHs) with masses of a few times 10$^{8}$

total projected linear sizes ranging from 86 kpc to 420 kpc, but their total

that the spiral structures are not destroyed. Only one of our sources

reconnection with asymmetries in the density and reconnecting magnetic field
strength in addition to a bulk flow shear across the reconnection site in the
plane of the reconnecting fields, which commonly occurs at planetary
magnetospheres. We predict the speed at which an isolated X-line is convected
by the flow, the reconnection rate, and the critical flow speed at which
reconnection no longer takes place for arbitrary reconnecting magnetic field
strengths, densities, and upstream flow speeds, and confirm the results with
two-fluid numerical simulations. The predictions and simulation results counter
the prevailing model of reconnection at Earth's dayside magnetopause which says
reconnection occurs with a stationary X-line for sub-Alfvenic magnetosheath
flow, reconnection occurs but the X-line convects for magnetosheath flows
between the Alfven speed and double the Alfven speed, and reconnection does not
occur for magnetosheath flows greater than double the Alfven speed. We find
that X-line motion is governed by momentum conservation from the upstream
flows, which are weighted differently in asymmetric systems, so the X-line
convects for generic conditions including sub-Alfvenic upstream speeds. For the
reconnection rate, while the cutoff condition for symmetric reconnection is
that the difference in flows on the two sides of the reconnection site is twice
the Alfven speed, we find asymmetries cause the cutoff speed for asymmetric
reconnection to be higher than twice the asymmetric form of the Alfven speed.
The results compare favorably with an observation of reconnection at Earth's
polar cusps during a period of northward interplanetary magnetic field, where
reconnection occurs despite the magnetosheath flow speed being more than twice
the magnetosheath Alfven speed, the previously proposed suppression condition.

We conclude that their light contaminated the previously identified progenitor
candidate. After subtraction of these stars, the progenitor appears to be
significantly fainter and bluer than previously measured. Post-explosion
photometry at the SN location indicates that the progenitor object has
disappeared. If single, the progenitor is compatible with a supergiant star of
B to mid-A spectral type, while a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star would be too luminous in
the ultraviolet to account for the observations. Moreover, our hydrodynamical

magnetic activity and rotation in these stars were hampered by the limited
number of M dwarfs with measured rotation periods (and the fact that vsini
measurements probe only rapid rotation). However, the photometric data from
MEarth allows us to probe a wide range of rotation periods for hundreds of M
dwarf stars (from shorter than than one to longer than 100 days). Over all M
spectral types that we probe, we find that the presence of magnetic activity is
tied to rotation, including for late-type, fully convective M dwarfs. We also
find evidence that the fraction of late-type M dwarfs that are active may be
higher at longer rotation periods compared to their early-type counterparts,
with several active, late-type, slowly rotating stars present in our sample.
Additionally, we find that all M dwarfs with rotation periods shorter than 26
days (early-type; M1-M4) and 86 days (late-type; M5-M8) are magnetically
active. This potential mismatch suggests that the physical mechanisms that
connect stellar rotation to chromospheric heating may be different in fully
convective stars. A kinematic analysis suggests that the magnetically active,
rapidly rotating stars are consistent with a kinematically young population,
while slow-rotators are less active or inactive and appear to belong to an
older, dynamically heated stellar population.

largely unexplored paradigm. Such light masses are out of reach for
conventional nuclear recoil direct detection experiments, but may be detected
through the small ionization signals caused by dark matter-electron scattering.
Semiconductors are well-studied and are particularly promising target materials
because their ${\cal O}(1~\rm{eV})$ band gaps allow for ionization signals from
dark matter as light as a few hundred keV. Current direct detection
technologies are being adapted for dark matter-electron scattering. In this
paper, we provide the theoretical calculations for dark matter-electron
scattering rate in semiconductors, overcoming several complications that stem
from the many-body nature of the problem. We use density functional theory to
numerically calculate the rates for dark matter-electron scattering in silicon
and germanium, and estimate the sensitivity for upcoming experiments such as
DAMIC and SuperCDMS. We find that the reach for these upcoming experiments has
the potential to be orders of magnitude beyond current direct detection
constraints and that sub-GeV dark matter has a sizable modulation signal. We
also give the first direct detection limits on sub-GeV dark matter from its
scattering off electrons in a semiconductor target (silicon) based on published
results from DAMIC. We make available publicly our code, QEdark, with which we
calculate our results. Our results can be used by experimental collaborations
to calculate their own sensitivities based on their specific setup. The
searches we propose will probe vast new regions of unexplored dark matter model

problem. Finding the correct floor, in a fast and efficient manner, in a
shopping mall or an unknown university building can save the users' search time
and can enable a myriad of Location Based Services in the future. One of the
most widely spread techniques for floor estimation in multi-floor buildings is
the fingerprinting-based localization using Received Signal Strength (RSS)
measurements coming from indoor networks, such as WLAN and BLE. The clear
advantage of RSS-based floor estimation is its ease of implementation on a
multitude of mobile devices at the Application Programming Interface (API)
level, because RSS values are directly accessible through API interface.
However, the downside of a fingerprinting approach, especially for large-scale
floor estimation and positioning solutions, is their need to store and transmit
a huge amount of fingerprinting data. The problem becomes more severe when the
localization is intended to be done on mobile devices which have limited
memory, power, and computational resources. An alternative floor estimation
method, which has lower complexity and is faster than the fingerprinting is the
Weighted Centroid Localization (WCL) method. The trade-off is however paid in
terms of a lower accuracy than the one obtained with traditional fingerprinting
with Nearest Neighbour (NN) estimates. In this paper a novel K-means-based
method for floor estimation via fingerprint clustering of WiFi and various
other positioning sensor outputs is introduced. Our method achieves a floor
estimation accuracy close to the one with NN fingerprinting, while
significantly improves the complexity and the speed of the floor detection
algorithm. The decrease in the database size is achieved through storing and
transmitting only the cluster heads (CH's) and their corresponding floor
labels.

backtrack. The final model is the smart kinetic walk. For all three of these
models the distribution of the point where the walk exits a simply connected
domain $D$ in the plane converges weakly to harmonic measure on $\partial D$ as
the lattice spacing $\delta \rightarrow 0$. Let $\omega(0,|dz|;D)$ be harmonic
measure for $D$, and let $\omega_\delta(0,|dz|;D)$ be the discrete harmonic
measure for one of the random walk models. Our definition of the random walk
models is unusual in that we average over the orientation of the lattice with
respect to the domain. We are interested in the limit of
$(\omega_\delta(0,|dz|;D)- \omega(0,|dz|;D))/\delta$. Our Monte Carlo
simulations of the three models lead to the conjecture that this limit equals
$c_{M,L} \, \rho_D(z) |dz|$, where the function $\rho_D(z)$ depends on the
domain, but not on the model or lattice, and the constant $c_{M,L}$ depends on
the model and on the lattice, but not on the domain. So there is a form of
universality for this first order correction. We also give an explicit formula
for the conjectured density $\rho_D$.

quantum photonic structures containing negatively charged silicon-vacancy

structures are realized by combining the growth of nanoand micro-diamonds on
silicon carbide (3C or 4H polytype) substrates, with the subsequent use of
these diamond crystals as a hard mask for pattern transfer. SiV$^-$ color
centers are incorporated in diamond during its synthesis from molecular diamond
seeds (diamondoids), with no need for ionimplantation or annealing. We show
that the same growth technique can be used to grow a diamond layer controllably
doped with SiV$^-$ on top of a high purity bulk diamond, in which we
subsequently fabricate nanopillar arrays containing high quality SiV$^-$
centers. Scanning confocal photoluminescence measurements reveal optically
active SiV$^-$ lines both at room temperature and low temperature (5 K) from
all fabricated structures, and, in particular, very narrow linewidths and small
inhomogeneous broadening of SiV$^-$ lines from all-diamond nano-pillar arrays,
which is a critical requirement for quantum computation. At low temperatures (5
K) we observe in these structures the signature typical of SiV$^-$ centers in
bulk diamond, consistent with a double lambda. These results indicate that high
quality color centers can be incorporated into nanophotonic structures
synthetically with properties equivalent to those in bulk diamond, thereby
opening opportunities for applications in classical and quantum information
processing.

first it constructs coresets for the ground set of items; thereafter, it
efficiently samples subsets based on the constructed coresets. As opposed to

with applications ranging from production planning to job processing in large

optimization problems, as well as their parameterized and reoptimization
variants.
  We first present improved bounds for job scheduling on unrelated parallel
machines, with the objective of minimizing the latest completion time
(makespan) of the schedule. We consider the subclass of fully-feasible
instances, in which the processing time of each job, on any machine, does not
exceed the minimum makespan. The problem is known to be hard to approximate
within factor 4/3 already in this subclass. Although fully-feasible instances
are hard to identify, we give a polynomial time algorithm that yields for such
instances a schedule whose makespan is better than twice the optimal, the best
known ratio for general instances. Moreover, we show that our result is robust
under small violations of feasibility constraints.
  We further study the power of parameterization. We show that makespan
minimization on unrelated machines admits a parameterized approximation scheme,
where the parameter used is the number of processing times that are large
relative to the latest completion time of the schedule. We also present an FPT
algorithm for the graph-balancing problem, which corresponds to the instances
of the restricted assignment problem where each job can be processed on at most
2 machines.
  Finally, motivated by practical scenarios, we initiate the study of
reoptimization in job scheduling on identical and uniform machines, with the
objective of minimizing the makespan. We develop reapproximation algorithms
that yield in both models the best possible approximation ratio of
$(1+\epsilon)$, for any $\epsilon >0$, with respect to the minimum makespan.

theory, adiabatic evolution and their topological interpretations. For systems
on an infinite crystal it is shown that there can only be topologically
unstable Fermi surfaces. For systems on a half- space and with a gapped bulk,
our derivation naturally yields a $\mathit{K}$-theory classification. Given the
$d-1$-dimensional surface Brillouin zone $\mathrm{X}_{s}$ of a $d$-dimensional
half-space, our result implies that different classes of globally stable Fermi
surfaces belong in $\mathit{K^{-1}}\mathrm{(X_{s})}$ for systems with only
discrete translation-invariance. This result has a chiral anomaly inflow

large gauge transformations forbid the propagation of electrically-charged

of local quantum field theory, has been proposed by Wiese and Polley, and is
based on the use of C* boundary conditions. We present a thorough analysis of
the properties and symmetries of QED in isolation and QED coupled to QCD, with
C* boundary conditions. In particular we learn that a certain class of
electrically-charged states can be constructed in this setup in a fully
consistent fashion, without relying on gauge fixing. We argue that this class
of states covers most of the interesting phenomenological applications in the

hundreds of thousands of people each year. In this paper, we develop a model
for allocating malaria interventions across geographic regions and time,
subject to budget constraints, with the aim of minimizing the number of
person-days of malaria infection. The model considers a range of several
conditions: climatic characteristics, treatment efficacy, distribution costs,
and treatment coverage. We couple an expanded susceptible-infected-recovered
(SIR) compartment model for the disease dynamics with an integer linear
programming (ILP) model for selecting the disease interventions. Our model
produces an intervention plan for all regions, identifying which combination of
interventions, with which level of coverage, to use in each region and year in
a five-year planning horizon. Simulations using the model yield high-level,
qualitative insights on optimal intervention policies: The optimal policy is
different when considering a five-year time horizon than when considering only
a single year, due to the effects that interventions have on the disease
transmission dynamics. The vaccine intervention is rarely selected, except if
its assumed cost is significantly lower than that predicted in the literature.
Increasing the available budget causes the number of person-days of malaria
infection to decrease linearly up to a point, after which the benefit of
increased budget starts to taper. The optimal policy is highly dependent on
assumptions about mosquito density, selecting different interventions for wet
climates with high density than for dry climates with low density, and the
interventions are found to be less effective at controlling malaria in the wet
climates when attainable intervention coverage is 60% or lower. However, when
intervention coverage of 80% is attainable, then malaria prevalence drops
quickly.

Using stochastic geometry, analytical expressions are derived for the energy

prove that for any $\epsilon>0$, $\Pr(1-\epsilon<\log |sA-dA|/\log|\sigma
A-\delta A|<1+\epsilon)$ goes to $1$ as the size of $A$ goes to infinity and we
give a set $A$ which has the current highest value of $\log |A+A|/\log |A-A|$.
We also study decompositions of intervals $\{0,1,\dots,n\}$ into MSTD sets and
prove that a positive proportion of decompositions into two sets have the
property that both sets are MSTD.

2M0441+2301 AabBab, a young (1--3 Myr) hierarchical quadruple system comprising
a low-mass star, two brown dwarfs, and a planetary-mass companion in Taurus.
All four components show spectroscopic signs of low surface gravity, and both
2M0441+2301 Aa and Ab possess Pa$\beta$ emission indicating they each harbor
accretion subdisks. Astrometry spanning 2008--2014 reveals orbital motion in
both the Aab (0.23"" separation) and Bab (0.095"" separation) pairs, although the
implied orbital periods of $>$300 years means dynamical masses will not be
possible in the near future. The faintest component (2M0441+2301 Bb) has an
angular $H$-band shape, strong molecular absorption (VO, CO, H$_2$O, and FeH),
and shallow alkali lines, confirming its young age, late spectral type (L1
$\pm$ 1), and low temperature ($\approx$1800~K). With individual masses of
200$^{+100}_{-50}$ Mjup, 35 $\pm$ 5 Mjup, 19 $\pm$ 3 Mjup, and 9.8 $\pm$ 1.8
Mjup, 2M0441+2301 AabBab is the lowest-mass quadruple system known. Its
hierarchical orbital architecture and mass ratios imply that it formed from the
collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud core, demonstrating that
planetary-mass companions can originate from a stellar-like pathway analogous
to higher-mass quadruple star systems as first speculated by Todorov et al.
More generally, cloud fragmentation may be an important formation pathway for
the massive exoplanets that are now regularly being imaged on wide orbits.

is the inherent need for a large amount of training data. Although there is a
lot of buzz about big data, there is still the problem of doing classification
from a small dataset. Other methods such as support vector machines, although
capable of dealing with few samples, are inherently binary classifiers, and are
in need of learning strategies such as One vs All in the case of
multi-classification. In the presence of a large number of classes this can
become problematic. In this paper we present, a novel approach to supervised
learning through the method of clustering. Unlike traditional methods such as
K-Means, Gravitational Clustering does not require the initial number of
clusters, and automatically builds the clusters, individual samples can be
arbitrarily weighted and it requires only few samples while staying resilient

systems, in particular, so-called safety-critical hybrid systems, because of
fundamental properties of nature, uncertain environments, or simplifications to
overcome complexity. Tightly intertwining discrete, continuous and stochastic
dynamics complicates modelling, analysis and verification of stochastic hybrid
systems (SHSs). In the literature, this issue has been extensively
investigated, but unfortunately it still remains challenging as no promising
general solutions are available yet. In this paper, we give our effort by
proposing a general compositional approach for modelling and verification of
SHSs. First, we extend Hybrid CSP (HCSP), a very expressive and process
algebra-like formal modeling language for hybrid systems, by introducing
probability and stochasticity to model SHSs, which is called stochastic HCSP
(SHCSP). To this end, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are generalized by
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and non-deterministic choice is
replaced by probabilistic choice. Then, we extend Hybrid Hoare Logic (HHL) to
specify and reason about SHCSP processes. We demonstrate our approach by an
example from real-world.

complicated process of structure formation in cosmology. This process is mainly
governed by gravity, which is the dominant force on large scales. To date, a
century after the formulation of general relativity, numerical codes for
structure formation still employ Newton's law of gravitation. This
approximation relies on the two assumptions that gravitational fields are weak
and that they are only sourced by non-relativistic matter. While the former
appears well justified on cosmological scales, the latter imposes restrictions
on the nature of the ""dark"" components of the Universe (dark matter and dark
energy) which are, however, poorly understood. Here we present the first
simulations of cosmic structure formation using equations consistently derived
from general relativity. We study in detail the small relativistic effects for
a standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology which cannot be obtained within a purely
Newtonian framework. Our particle-mesh N-body code computes all six degrees of
freedom of the metric and consistently solves the geodesic equation for
particles, taking into account the relativistic potentials and the
frame-dragging force. This conceptually clean approach is very general and can
be applied to various settings where the Newtonian approximation fails or
becomes inaccurate, ranging from simulations of models with dynamical dark
energy or warm/hot dark matter to core collapse supernova explosions.

flow is a consequence of melting of a heterogeneous mantle, and that spreading
rate modulates the dynamics of the localized flow. A corollary of this finding
is that both mantle het- erogeneity and spreading rate have implications for
the speed and time scale of melt migration. Here, we investigate these
implications using numerical models of magma flow in heterogeneous mantle
beneath spreading plates. The models predict that a broad distribution of magma
flow speeds is characteristic of the sub-ridge mantle. Within the melting
region, magmatic flow is fastest in regions of average fusibility;
surprisingly, magmas from sources of above-average fusibility travel to the
ridge in a longer time. Spreading rate has comparatively simple consequences,
mainly resulting in faster segregation speeds at higher spreading rates. The
computed time scales are short enough to preserve deep origin 230Th
disequilibria and, under favourable parameter regimes, also 226Ra excesses. An
important prediction from the models is that mantle heterogeneity induces
significant natural variability into U-series disequilibria, complicating the
identification of relationships between disequilibria and ridge properties or
chemical signatures of heterogeneity.

cooperatively minimize the sum of their locally known convex costs. A popular
class of methods to solve these problems are the distributed gradient methods,
which are attractive due to their inexpensive iterations, but have a drawback
of slow convergence rates. This motivates the incorporation of second-order
information in the distributed methods, but this task is challenging: although
the Hessians which arise in the algorithm design respect the sparsity of the
network, their inverses are dense, hence rendering distributed implementations
difficult. We overcome this challenge and propose a class of distributed
Newton-like methods, which we refer to as Distributed Quasi Newton (DQN). The
DQN family approximates the Hessian inverse by: 1) splitting the Hessian into
its diagonal and off-diagonal part, 2) inverting the diagonal part, and 3)
approximating the inverse of the off-diagonal part through a weighted linear
function. The approximation is parameterized by the tuning variables which
correspond to different splittings of the Hessian and by different weightings
of the off-diagonal Hessian part. Specific choices of the tuning variables give
rise to different variants of the proposed general DQN method -- dubbed DQN-0,
DQN-1 and DQN-2 -- which mutually trade-off communication and computational
costs for convergence. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed DQN methods.

surface states (TSSs) on the activity of transition metal clusters (Au, Ag, Cu,
Pt, and Pd), which are supported on a TI Bi2Se3 substrate. It was found the
adsorption energy of oxygen on the supported catalysts can be always enhanced
due to the TSSs. However, it does not necessarily mean an increase of the
activity in catalytic oxidation reaction. Rather, the enhanced adsorption
behavior in the presence of TSSs exhibits dual effects, determined by the
intrinsic reactivity of these catalysts with oxygen. For the Au case, the
activity of catalytic oxidation can be improved because the intrinsic binding
between Au and O is relatively weak. In contrast, a negative effect is found
for the Pt and Pd clusters since the intrinsic binding of Pt and Pd with oxygen
is too strong. We also found that the effect of TSSs on the activity of
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is quite similar, i.e. the metals with
original weak reactivity can gain a positive effect from TSSs. The present work

luminosity is `smeared out' into a rising probability of explosion over a $\sim

richest individuals enact some protection mechanisms (""saving propensity"")
which allow them to put at stake, in their interactions, only a small part of
their wealth. In high-energy particle collisions something similar happens, in
the sense that when particles with very large energy collide with slow
particles, then as a sole consequence of relativistic kinematics (mass
dilation), they tend to exchange only a small part of their energy; processes
like the frontal collision of two identical particles, where the exchanged
energy is 100%, are very improbable, at least in a diluted gas. We thus show
how in two completely different systems, one of socio-economic nature and one

and quasianalytic type. It is shown that the microlocal properties of an
ultradistribution can be obtained by sampling the Fourier transforms of its
localizations over a lattice in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. In particular, we prove the
following discrete characterization of the analytic wave front set of a
distribution $f\in\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$. Let $\Lambda$ be a lattice in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and let $U$ be an open convex neighborhood of the origin such
that $U\cap\Lambda^{*}=\{0\}$. The analytic wave front set $WF_{A}(f)$
coincides with the complement in $\Omega\times(\mathbb{R}^{d}\setminus\{0\})$
of the set of points $(x_0,\xi_0)$ for which there are an open neighborhood
$V\subset \Omega\cap (x_0+U)$ of $x_0$, an open conic neighborhood $\Gamma$ of
$\xi_0$, and a bounded sequence $(f_p)_{p \in \mathbb{N}}$ in
$\mathcal{E}'(\Omega\cap (x_0+U))$ with $f_p= f$ on $V$ such that for some $h >
0$ \[ \sup_{\mu \in \Gamma \cap \Lambda} |\widehat{f_p} (\mu)| |\mu|^p \leq
h^{p+1}p!\:, \qquad \forall p \in \mathbb{N}. \]

obtained via general relativity for $r(\varphi)$ and for the corresponding
perihelion precession angle $\Delta \varphi$, with the formulae obtained via
the relativistic gravitational law, $F=GMm\gamma^6/r^2$. The latter law can be
derived from Newton's gravitational law by employing the gravitational rather
than the rest masses of the Sun and Mercury. Remarkably, it is found that the
two expressions for the dominant part of $r(\varphi)$ are identical and that
the two expressions for $\Delta\varphi$ are also identical.

  with added white noise",,,"10.1063/5.0108829",,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we discuss the behavior of a linear classical parametric
amplifier (PA) in the presence of white noise and give theoretical estimates of
the noise spectral density based on approximate Green's functions obtained by
using averaging techniques. Furthermore, we give analytical estimates for
parametric amplification bandwidth of the amplifier and for the noisy
precursors to instability. To validate our theory we compare the analytical
results with experimental data obtained in an analog circuit. We describe the
implementation details and the setup used in the experimental study of the
amplifier. Near the threshold to the first parametric instability, and in
degenerate-mode amplification, the PA achieved very high gains in a very narrow
bandwidth centered on its resonance frequency. In quasi-degenerate mode
amplification, we obtained lower values of gain, but with a wider bandwidth
that is tunable. The experimental data were accurately described by the
predictions of the model. Moreover, we noticed spectral components in the
output signal of the amplifier which are due to noise precursors of
instability. The position, width, and magnitude of these components are in
agreement with the noise spectral density obtained by the theory proposed here.

studied in this paper to solve the compressive sensing problem $\yv = \Amat \xv
+ \epsilonv$. By assuming that $\Amat\Amat\ts$ is invertible, we prove that GAP
converges linearly within a certain range of step-size when the sensing matrix
$\Amat$ satisfies restricted isometry property (RIP) condition of
$\delta_{2K}$, where $K$ is the sparsity of $\xv$. The theoretical analysis is
extended to the adaptively iterative thresholding (AIT) algorithms, for which
the convergence rate is also derived based on $\delta_{2K}$ of the sensing
matrix. We further prove that, under the same conditions, the convergence rate
of GAP is faster than that of AIT. Extensive simulation results confirm the
theoretical assertions.

  Framework-relativity","59 pages, 2 tables",,,,"q-bio.OT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  For more than fifty years, taxonomists have proposed numerous alternative
definitions of species while they searched for a unique, comprehensive, and
persuasive definition. This monograph shows that these efforts have been
unnecessary, and indeed have provably been a pursuit of a will o' the wisp
because they have failed to recognize the theoretical impossibility of what
they seek to accomplish. A clear and rigorous understanding of the logic
underlying species definition leads both to a recognition of the inescapable
ambiguity that affects the definition of species, and to a framework-relative
approach to species definition that is logically compelling, i.e., cannot not
be accepted without inconsistency. An appendix reflects upon the conclusions
reached, applying them in an intellectually whimsical taxonomic thought
experiment that conjectures the possibility of an emerging new human species.
