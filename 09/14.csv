  Boundary-Value and Obstacle Problems with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions","41 Pages",,,,"math.PR math.AP q-fin.MF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove Feynman-Kac formulas for solutions to elliptic and parabolic
boundary value and obstacle problems associated with a general Markov diffusion
process. Our diffusion model covers several popular stochastic volatility
models, such as the Heston model, the CEV model and the SABR model, which are
widely used as asset pricing models in mathematical finance. The generator of
this Markov process with killing is a second-order, degenerate, elliptic
partial differential operator, where the degeneracy in the operator symbol is
proportional to the $2\alpha$-power of the distance to the boundary of the
half-plane, with $\alpha\in(0,1]$. Our stochastic representation formulas
provide the unique solutions to the elliptic boundary value and obstacle
problems, when we seek solutions which are suitably smooth up to the boundary
portion $\Gamma_{0}$ contained in the boundary of the upper half-plane. In the
case when the full Dirichlet condition is given, our stochastic representation
formulas provide the unique solutions which are not guaranteed to be any more
than continuous up to the boundary portion $\Gamma_{0}$.

observed in the Small Magellanic Cloud within the magnetic levitation accretion
scenario. This implies that their X-ray emission is powered by a wind-fed
accretion onto a neutron star (NS) which captures matter from a magnetized
stellar wind. The NS in this case is accreting matter from a non-keplerian
magnetically levitating disc (ML-disc) which is surrounding its magnetosphere.
This allows us to explain the observed periods of the pulsars in terms of spin
equilibrium without the need of invoking dipole magnetic fields outside the
usual range ~ 10^11- 10^13 G inferred from cyclotron features of Galactic high
mass X-ray binaries. We find that the equilibrium period of a NS, under certain
conditions, depends strongly on the magnetization of the stellar wind of its
massive companion and, correspondingly, on the magnetic field of the massive
companion itself. This may help to explain why similar NSs in binaries with
similar properties rotate with different periods yielding a large scatter of
periods of the accretion-powered pulsar observed in SMC and our galaxy.

success on image classification. CNNs mainly consist of convolutional and
pooling layers, both of which are performed on local image areas without
considering the dependencies among different image regions. However, such
dependencies are very important for generating explicit image representation.
In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are well known for their ability
of encoding contextual information among sequential data, and they only require
a limited number of network parameters. General RNNs can hardly be directly
applied on non-sequential data. Thus, we proposed the hierarchical RNNs
(HRNNs). In HRNNs, each RNN layer focuses on modeling spatial dependencies
among image regions from the same scale but different locations. While the
cross RNN scale connections target on modeling scale dependencies among regions
from the same location but different scales. Specifically, we propose two
recurrent neural network models: 1) hierarchical simple recurrent network
(HSRN), which is fast and has low computational cost; and 2) hierarchical
long-short term memory recurrent network (HLSTM), which performs better than
HSRN with the price of more computational cost.
  In this manuscript, we integrate CNNs with HRNNs, and develop end-to-end
convolutional hierarchical recurrent neural networks (C-HRNNs). C-HRNNs not
only make use of the representation power of CNNs, but also efficiently encodes
spatial and scale dependencies among different image regions. On four of the
most challenging object/scene image classification benchmarks, our C-HRNNs
achieve state-of-the-art results on Places 205, SUN 397, MIT indoor, and

conceptual understanding and compare teaching methods. It is common to look at
students' changes in their answers between a pre-test and a post-test to
quantify a transition in student's conceptions. This is often done by looking
at the proportion of incorrect answers in the pre-test that changes to correct
answers in the post-test -- the gain -- and the proportion of correct answers
that changes to incorrect answers -- the loss. By comparing theoretical
predictions to experimental data on the Force Concept Inventory, we shown that
Item Response Theory (IRT) is able to fairly well predict the observed gains
and losses. We then use IRT to quantify the student's changes in a test-retest
situation when no learning occurs and show that $i)$ up to 25\% of total
answers can change due to the non-deterministic nature of student's answer and
that $ii)$ gains and losses can go from 0\% to 100\%. Still using IRT, we
highlight the conditions that must satisfy a test in order to minimize gains
and losses when no learning occurs. Finally, recommandations on the
interpretation of such pre/post-test progression with respect to the initial
level of students are proposed.

model input, the main information about the output probability distribution by
using this metamodel and without running the computer code. In practical
applications, such a metamodel enables one to have estimations of every
possible random variable properties, such as the expectation, the probability
of exceeding a threshold or any quantile. The present work is concentrated on
the emulation of the quantile function of the stochastic simulator by
interpolating well chosen basis function and metamodeling their coefficients
(using the Gaussian process metamodel). This quantile function metamodel is
then used to treat a simple optimization strategy maintenance problem using a
stochastic code, in order to optimize the quantile of an economic indicator.
Using the Gaussian process framework, an adaptive design method (called QFEI)
is defined by extending in our case the well known EGO algorithm. This allows
to obtain an ""optimal"" solution using a small number of simulator runs.

including the MSEIV, MSEIR, MSEIS, SEIV, SEIR, SEIS, SIV, SIRS, SIR, and SIS
models. Furthermore, we show how the $SI^*V^*$ model allows us to model
non-Poisson spreading processes letting us capture much more complicated
dynamics than existing works such as information spreading through social
networks or the delayed incubation period of a disease like Ebola. This is in
contrast to the overwhelming majority of works in the literature that only
consider spreading processes that can be captured by a Markov process. After
developing the stochastic model, we analyze its deterministic mean-field
approximation and provide conditions for when the disease-free equilibrium is
stable. Simulations illustrate our results.

and pasting a collection of semi-regular polygons. We characterize the set of
symbolic sequences (cutting sequences) that arise by coding linear trajectories
by the sequence of polygon sides crossed. We provide a full characterization
for the closure of the set of cutting sequences, in the spirit of the classical
characterization of Sturmian sequences and the recent characterization of
Smillie-Ulcigrai of cutting sequences of linear trajectories on regular
polygons. The characterization is in terms of a system of finitely many
substitutions (also known as an S-adic presentation), governed by a
one-dimensional continued fraction-like map. As in the Sturmian and regular
polygon case, the characterization is based on renormalization and the
definition of a suitable combinatorial derivation operator. One of the
novelties is that derivation is done in two steps, without directly using Veech
group elements, but by exploiting an affine diffeomorphism that maps a
Bouw-Moeller surface to the dual Bouw-M\""oller surface in the same Teichmueller
disk. As a technical tool, we crucially exploit the presentation of
Bouw-M\""oller surfaces via Hooper diagrams.

that the molecule-metal coupling contains an intensity dependent contribution

renormalization of the molecule metal tunneling barrier). We find that
interference between vibrational and electronic inelastic scattering routes is
possible in the presence of strong enough electron-vibrational coupling and can
in principle lead to the observed Fano-like feature in the Raman scattering

patterns than ever. Some individuals engage through online social networks

ways (e.g., face-to-face). Therefore, understanding the dynamics of information
propagation among humans calls for a multi-layer network model where an online

a study of information diffusion in a clustered multi-layer network model,
where all constituent layers are random networks with high clustering. We
assume that information propagates according to the SIR model and with
different information transmissibility across the networks. We give results for
the conditions, probability, and size of information epidemics, i.e., cases
where information starts from a single individual and reaches a positive
fraction of the population. We show that increasing the level of clustering in
either one of the layers increases the epidemic threshold and decreases the

information with low transmissibility spreads more effectively with a small but
densely connected social network, whereas highly transmissible information
spreads better with the help of a large but loosely connected social network.

the manipulation of which can potentially lead to new types of electronics, in
analogy to the role played by electron spin. In materials with broken inversion
symmetry, such as an electrically gated bilayer graphene, the momentum-space
Berry curvature $\Omega$ carries opposite sign in the K and K' valleys. A sign
reversal of $\Omega$ along an internal boundary of the sheet gives rise to
counter-propagating one-dimensional conducting modes encoded with opposite
valley indices. These metallic states are topologically protected against
backscattering in the absence of valley-mixing scattering, and thus can carry
current ballistically. In bilayer graphene, the reversal of $\Omega$ can occur
at the domain wall of AB and BA stacked domains, or at the line junction of two
oppositely gated regions. The latter approach can provide a scalable platform
to implement valleytronic operations such as valves and waveguides, but is
technically challenging to realize. Here we fabricate a dual-split-gate

gate-controlled ballistic valley transport and the development of valleytronic

in a crystal (or non-linear molecule) due to the presence of a degenerate
electronic state. Usually, the Jahn-Teller distortion is not polar. Recently,
GaV4S8 with the lacunar spinel structure was found to undergoes a Jahn-Teller
distortion from cubic to ferroelectric rhombohedral structure at TJT = 38K. In
this work, we carry out a general group theory analysis to show how and when
the Jahn-Teller effect gives rise to ferroelectricity. On the basis of this
theory, we find that the ferroelectric Jahn-Teller distort in GaV4S8 is due to
the non-centrosymmetric nature of the parent phase and strong electron-phonon
interaction related to two low-energy T2 phonon modes. Interestingly, GaV4S8 is
not only ferroelectric, but also ferromagnetic with the magnetic easy axis
along the ferroelectric direction. This suggests that GaV4S8 is a multiferroic
in which an external electric field may control its magnetization direction.
Our study not only explains the Jahn-Teller physics in GaV4S8, but also paves a
new way for searching and designing new ferroelectrics and multiferroics.

triphenyl-lead lattice composed of only main group elements is susceptible to a
magnetic instability, characterized by a considerably more stable
antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulating state rather than the topologically
nontrivial quantum spin Hall state proposed recently. Even though this AFM
phase is topologically trivial, it possesses an intricate emergent degree of
freedom, defined by the product of spin and valley indices, leading to Berry
curvature-induced spin and valley currents under electron or hole doping.
Furthermore, such a trivial band insulator can be tuned into a topologically
nontrivial matter by the application of an out-of-plane electric field, which
destroys the AFM order, favoring instead ferrimagnetic spin ordering and a
quantum anomalous Hall state with a non-zero topological invariant. These
findings further enrich our understanding of 2D hexagonal organometallic
lattices for potential applications in spintronics and valleytronics.

simulations of multi-moded phononic waveguides, we discuss the effects of
finite geometry and mode-converting junctions on the phonon transmission in
PnFs. The principles described may be utilized to form a wide stopband in
acoustic and surface wave media. Relative to the quantum of thermal conductance
for a uniform mesoscopic beam, a PnF with a stopband covering 1.6-10.4 GHz is
estimated to reduce the thermal conductance by an order of magnitude at 75mK.

a sum of misspecified agentspecific expectation-valued convex functions over
the intersection of a collection of agent-specific convex sets. This
misspecification is manifested in a parametric sense and may be resolved
through solving a distinct stochastic convex learning problem. Our interest
lies in the development of distributed algorithms in which every agent makes
decisions based on the knowledge of its objective and feasibility set while
learning the decisions of other agents by communicating with its local
neighbors over a time-varying connectivity graph. While a significant body of
research currently exists in the context of such problems, we believe that the
misspecified generalization of this problem is both important and has seen
little study, if at all. Accordingly, our focus lies on the simultaneous
resolution of both problems through a joint set of schemes that combine three
distinct steps: (i) An alignment step in which every agent updates its current
belief by averaging over the beliefs of its neighbors; (ii) A projected
(stochastic) gradient step in which every agent further updates this averaged
estimate; and (iii) A learning step in which agents update their belief of the
misspecified parameter by utilizing a stochastic gradient step. Under an
assumption of mere convexity on agent objectives and strong convexity of the
learning problems, we show that the sequences generated by this collection of
update rules converge almost surely to the solution of the correctly specified
stochastic convex optimization problem and the stochastic learning problem,
respectively.

soft materials, and comprehension of their shear response to external forces is
a key element to the fundamental understanding. A mesoscale model has been
presented in this article based on digitization of a biofilm microstructure.
Its response under externally applied shear load is analyzed. Strain stiffening
type behavior is readily observed under high strain loads due to the unfolding
of chains within soft polymeric substrate. Sustained shear loading of the
biofilm network results in strain localization along the diagonal direction.
Rupture of the soft polymeric matrix can potentially reduce the intercellular
interaction between the bacterial cells. Evolution of stiffness within the
biofilm network under shear reveals two regions: a) initial increase in
stiffness due to strain stiffening of polymer matrix, and b) eventual reduction
in stiffness because of tear in polymeric substrate.

two slowly rising THz bursts, via gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation based on our
numerical simulations of burst spectra in the magnetic dipole field case. The
electron density variation is much larger in the THz source than that in

20--50$\%$ during the decay phase for the three events, but the MW one
increased by 28$\%$ for the 2003 November 2 event. In the paper we will present

has been conducted, providing international teams the opportunity to test a

the accuracy of existing automated source finding and measurement approaches,
and to identify potential limitations. The Challenge attracted nine independent
teams, who tested eleven different source finding tools. In addition, the
Challenge initiators also tested the current ASKAPsoft source-finding tool to
establish how it could benefit from incorporating successful features of the
other tools. Here we present the results of the Data Challenge, identifying the
successes and limitations for this broad variety of the current generation of
radio source finding tools. As expected, most finders demonstrate completeness
levels close to 100% at 10sigma dropping to levels around 10% by 5sigma. The
reliability is typically close to 100% at 10sigma, with performance to lower
sensitivities varying greatly between finders. All finders demonstrate the
usual trade-off between completeness and reliability, whereby maintaining a
high completeness at low signal-to-noise comes at the expense of reduced
reliability, and vice-versa. We conclude with a series of recommendations for
improving the performance of the ASKAPsoft source-finding tool.

Under reasonable assumptions, we show that a modified form of RRLMs can get

worst-case bound on the space of possible solutions. The results hold for any
convex loss, even when the underlying functional relationship is nonlinear, and
the solution is not unique. Our approach combines ideas in Markov boundary and

We show that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge, and the coordinatewise

Our theoretical investigations focus on nonasymptotic robust analysis, which

the fact that the experimenter is not in charge of the treatment assignment
mechanism. Many potential con- founding factors (PCFs) exist in such a
scenario, and if one seeks to estimate the causal effect of the treatment on a
response, one needs to control for such factors. Identifying all relevant PCFs
may be difficult (or impossible) given a single observational study. Instead,
we argue that if one can observe a sequence of similar treatments over the
course of a lengthy time period, one can identify patterns of behavior in the
experimental subjects that are correlated with the response of interest and
control for those patterns directly. Specifically, in our case-study we find
and control for an early-adopter effect: the scenario in which the magnitude of
the response is highly correlated with how quickly one adopts a treatment after
its release.
  We provide a flexible hierarchical Bayesian framework that controls for such

product) from eBay, Inc. The users in our study upgrade (or not) to a new
version of the product at their own volition and timing. Our response variable

are investigated by first-principles calculations. These properties are mainly
dominated by the competition or cooperation among stacking, curvature and edge
effects. For the zigzag FGNRs, the more stable structures are revealed to be AB
stackings, while for the armchair types, AA"" stackings are more stable. The
interlayer interactions and hybridization of four orbitals lead to smaller
energy gaps, anti-crossing bands, and more band-edge states. Specifically, the
broken mirror symmetry in the odd-AB stacked zigzag FGNRs is responsible for
the spin-up and spin-down splitting subbands. All FGNRs are direct-gap
semiconductors except that the edge-edge interactions cause the even-AA stacked
zigzag FGNRs to exhibit a pair of metallic linear bands. The width-dependent
energy gaps in the armchair FGNRs can be classified into six groups.
Furthermore, there exist rich features in density of states, including the
form, number, intensity and energy of the special structures.

templates of known T dwarfs in the field, i.e., of the old populations, Oph

The scaling ansatz remains valid in the strong interaction limit for the

down in the weak interaction one. As approaching the upper critical dimension,
physical quantities develop logarithmic dependence on dimensionality in the

have been used for studying various quantum phenomena. In this work, using a
four-qubit NMR quantum simulator, we investigate the recently postulated
quantum pigeon-hole effect. In mathematics, the pigeonhole effect is described
by a set of three objects being allocated with only two containers.
Classically, one would expect at least one container to accommodate more than
one object. However, recently it was predicted that there exist quantum
scenarios wherein three quantum particles appear to reside in two containers in
such a way that no two particles can be simultaneously assigned with a single
container. In our experiments, quantum pigeons are emulated by three nuclear
qubits whose states are probed jointly and noninvasively by an ancillary spin.
The qubit-states $\{\ket{0}$, $\ket{1}\}$ emulate the two containers available
for each of the qubits. The experimental results are in good agreement with
quantum theoretical predictions.

  Unknown sampling location, sample quantization, unknown bandwidth of the

field estimation. In this work, except for quantization, the other three issues
will be tackled together in a mobile-sampling framework. Spatially bandlimited
fields are considered. It is assumed that measurement-noise affected field
samples are collected on spatial locations obtained from an unknown renewal
process. That is, the samples are obtained on locations obtained from a renewal
process, but the sampling locations and the renewal process distribution are
unknown. In this unknown sampling location setup, it is shown that the
mean-squared error in field estimation decreases as $O(1/n)$ where $n$ is the
average number of samples collected by the mobile sensor. The average number of
samples collected is determined by the inter-sample spacing distribution in the
renewal process. An algorithm to ascertain spatial field's bandwidth is
detailed, which works with high probability as the average number of samples
$n$ increases. This algorithm works in the same setup, i.e., in the presence of

be successfully treated by administering erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
(ESAs). ESAs dosing is currently based on clinical protocols that often do not
account for the high inter- and intra-individual variability in the patient's
response. As a result, the hemoglobin level of some patients oscillates around
the target range, which is associated with multiple risks and side-effects.
This work proposes a methodology based on reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize ESA therapy.
  Methods: RL is a data-driven approach for solving sequential decision-making
problems that are formulated as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Computing
optimal drug administration strategies for chronic diseases is a sequential
decision-making problem in which the goal is to find the best sequence of drug
doses. MDPs are particularly suitable for modeling these problems due to their
ability to capture the uncertainty associated with the outcome of the treatment
and the stochastic nature of the underlying process. The RL algorithm employed
in the proposed methodology is fitted Q iteration, which stands out for its
ability to make an efficient use of data.
  Results: The experiments reported here are based on a computational model
that describes the effect of ESAs on the hemoglobin level. The performance of
the proposed method is evaluated and compared with the well-known Q-learning
algorithm and with a standard protocol. Simulation results show that the
performance of Q-learning is substantially lower than FQI and the protocol.
  Conclusion: Although prospective validation is required, promising results
demonstrate the potential of RL to become an alternative to current protocols.

We
theoretically formulate the evolution of grain size distribution, taking into
account dust supply from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and dust
destruction by sputtering in the hot interstellar medium (ISM), whose
temperature evolution is treated by including two cooling paths: gas emission
and dust emission (i.e. gas cooling and dust cooling). With our new full
treatment of grain size distribution, we confirm that dust destruction by
sputtering is too efficient to explain the observed dust abundance even if AGB
stars continue to supply dust grains, and that, except for the case where the
initial dust-to-gas ratio in the hot gas is as high as $\sim 0.01$, dust
cooling is negligible compared with gas cooling. However, we show that,
contrary to previous expectations, cooling does not help to protect the dust;
rather, the sputtering efficiency is raised by the gas compression as a result
of cooling. We additionally consider grain growth after the gas cools down.
Dust growth by the accretion of gas-phase metals in the cold medium increase
the dust-to-gas ratio up to $\sim 10^{-3}$ if this process lasts >10/(n_H/10^3
cm^{-3}) Myr, where $n_\mathrm{H}$ is the number density of hydrogen nuclei. We
show that the accretion of gas-phase metals is a viable mechanism of increasing
the dust abundance in elliptical galaxies to a level consistent with
observations, and that the steepness of observed extinction curves is better
explained with grain growth by accretion.

data, {\em i.e.}, data with large sizes. Conventional compressive sensing
methods for large-scale data will suffer from low computational efficiency and
massive memory storage. In this paper, we revisit well-known solvers called
greedy algorithms, including Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), Subspace
Pursuit (SP), Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement (OMPR). Generally,
these approaches are conducted by iteratively executing two main steps: 1)
support detection and 2) solving least square problem.
  To reduce the cost of Step 1, it is not hard to employ the sensing matrix
that can be implemented by operator-based strategy instead of matrix-based one
and can be speeded by fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Step 2, however, requires
maintaining and calculating a pseudo-inverse of a sub-matrix, which is random
and not structural, and, thus, operator-based matrix does not work. To overcome
this difficulty, instead of solving Step 2 by a closed-form solution, we
propose a fast and cost-effective least square solver, which combines a
Conjugate Gradient (CG) method with our proposed weighted least square problem
to iteratively approximate the ground truth yielded by a greedy algorithm.
Extensive simulations and theoretical analysis validate that the proposed
method is cost-efficient and is readily incorporated with the existing greedy
algorithms to remarkably improve the performance for large-scale problems.

spectrum of an exoplanet is increasingly becoming the target of observational
campaigns because the spectral slope of the Rayleigh continuum enables one to
determine the scaleheight of its atmosphere in the absence of hazes. However,
this is only true when one ignores the refractive effects of the exoplanet's
atmosphere. I illustrate with a suite of simple isothermal clear Jovian H2-He
atmosphere models with various abundances of water that refraction can decrease
significantly the spectral slope of the Rayleigh continuum and that it becomes
flat in the infrared. This mimics a surface, or an optically thick cloud deck,
at much smaller pressures than one can probe in the non-refractive case. The
relative impact of refraction on an exoplanet's transmission spectrum decreases
with atmospheric temperatures and increases with stellar temperature.
Refraction is quite important from a retrieval's perspective for Jovian-like
planets even at the highest atmospheric temperatures (1200 K) considered in
this paper, and for all stellar spectral types. Indeed, refraction breaks in
large part the retrieval degeneracy between abundances of chemical species and
the planet's radius because the size of spectral features increases
significantly with abundances, in stark contrast with the non-refractive case
which simply shifts them to a larger or smaller effective radius. Abundances
inferred assuming the atmosphere is cloud-free are lower limits. These results
show how important it is to include refraction in retrieval algorithms to
interpret transmission spectra of gas giants accurately.

customers within an urban environment and are coordinated to optimize service

discrete-time model of an AMoD system and we show that this formulation allows
the easy integration of a number of real-world constraints, e.g., electric
vehicle charging constraints. Second, leveraging our model, we design a model
predictive control algorithm for the optimal coordination of an AMoD system and
prove its stability in the sense of Lyapunov. At each optimization step, the
vehicle scheduling and routing problem is solved as a mixed integer linear
program (MILP) where the decision variables are binary variables representing
whether a vehicle will 1) wait at a station, 2) service a customer, or 3)
rebalance to another station. Finally, by using real-world data, we show that
the MPC algorithm can be run in real-time for moderately-sized systems and
outperforms previous control strategies for AMoD systems.

this paper, we propose MINE GOLD (a Model of INformation markEt for

information to unlicensed white space devices (WSDs) for profit. Specifically,
we focus on an oligopoly information market with multiple databases, and study
the interactions among databases and WSDs using a two-stage hierarchical model.
In Stage I, databases compete to sell information to WSDs by optimizing their
information prices. In Stage II, each WSD decides whether and from which
database to purchase the information, to maximize his benefit of using the TV
white space. We first characterize how the WSDs' purchasing behaviors
dynamically evolve, and what is the equilibrium point under fixed information
prices from the databases. We then analyze how the system parameters and the
databases' pricing decisions affect the market equilibrium, and what is the
equilibrium of the database price competition. Our numerical results show that,
perhaps counter-intuitively, the databases' aggregate revenue is not monotonic
with the number of databases. Moreover, numerical results show that a large
degree of positive network externality would improve the databases' revenues

particularly simple scaling law for the lepton charge asymmetry and also
predicts that measurements in different collision systems (p-p, p-$\bar{\rm

points of the Darboux equation which are located at the four half-periods of
the torus. The symmetry group of the Darboux equation is given by the Coxeter
group $B_4\cong G_{\mathrm{I}}\rtimes_{\Gamma} G_{\mathrm{II}}$ where the
actions of $G_{\mathrm{I}}$ correspond to the sign changes of the parameters in
the solutions of the equations, which have no effective changes on the equation
itself, while the actions of $G_{\mathrm{II}}$ permute the four half-periods of
the torus, which are described by a short-exact sequence. We are able to
clarify the symmetries of the equation when ordered bases of the underlying
torus change. Our results show that it is much more transparent to consider the

possibility of foreground contamination complicates the analysis of the nature
of LyC emitters, although statistically it is highly unlikely that all
candidates in our sample are contaminated by foreground sources. Many viable
LyC LAE candidates have flux density ratios inconsistent with standard models,
while also having too blue UV slopes to be foreground contaminants. Stacking
reveals no significant LyC detection, suggesting that there is a dearth of
objects with marginal LyC signal strength, perhaps due to a bimodality in the
LyC emission. The foreground contamination-corrected $3\sigma$ upper limits of
the observed average flux density ratios are $f_{LyC}/f_{UV}<0.08$ from

hoc networks. We first characterize the distribution of the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) through the Laplace transform of
the inverted SINR for non-fading channels. Since most communication systems are
interference-limited, we also consider the case of negligible noise power, and
derive the upper and lower bounds for the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)
distribution under both non-fading and fading cases. These bounds are of closed
forms and thus more convenient for theoretical analysis. Based on these
derivations, we obtain closed-form bounds for both the average Shannon and
outage rates. We also leverage the above results to study partial fading ad-hoc
systems. These results are useful for investigating and comparing
fifth-generation communication systems, for example massive multi-antenna and
small-cell networks as in our illustrative example.

precision. In this paper we develop a general theory for the parameter
estimation based on weak measurement technique with arbitrary postselection.
The previous weak value amplification model and the joint weak measurement
model are two special cases in our theory. Applying the developed theory, the
time-delay estimation is investigated in both theory and experiment.
Experimental results shows that when the time-delay is ultra small, the joint
weak measurement scheme outperforms the weak value amplification scheme, and is
robust against not only the misalignment errors but also the
wavelength-dependence of the optical components. These results are consistent
with the theoretical predictions that has not been verified by any experiment
before.

February 2014. V745 Sco was first observed by Swift a mere 3.7 hr after the
announcement of the optical discovery, with the super-soft X-ray emission being
detected around four days later and lasting for only ~two days, making it both
the fastest follow-up of a nova by Swift and the earliest switch-on of
super-soft emission yet detected. Such an early switch-on time suggests a
combination of a very high velocity outflow and low ejected mass and, together
with the high effective temperature reached by the super-soft emission, a high
mass white dwarf (>1.3 M_sun). The X-ray spectral evolution was followed from
an early epoch where shocked emission was evident, through the entirety of the
super-soft phase, showing evolving column density, emission lines, absorption
edges and thermal continuum temperature. UV grism data were also obtained
throughout the super-soft interval, with the spectra showing mainly emission
lines from lower ionization transitions and the Balmer continuum in emission.
V745 Sco is compared with both V2491 Cyg (another nova with a very short
super-soft phase) and M31N 2008-12a (the most rapidly recurring nova yet
discovered). The longer recurrence time compared to M31N 2008-12a could be due
to a lower mass accretion rate, although inclination of the system may also
play a part. Nova V745 Sco (2014) revealed the fastest evolving super-soft
source phase yet discovered, providing a detailed and informative dataset for
study.

on the amount, depth profile and horizontal distribution of these contaminants

variables and calculates ambient dose equivalent rates at 1 m above the ground.
Good correlation is found between predicted dose rates and dose rates measured
with survey meters in Fukushima Prefecture in areas contaminated with
radiocesium from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. This
finding is insensitive to the choice for modelling the activity depth
distribution in the ground using activity measurements of collected soil
layers, or by using exponential and hyperbolic secant fits to the measurement
data. Better predictions are obtained by modelling the horizontal distribution
of radioactive cesium across an area if multiple soil samples are available, as
opposed to assuming a spatially homogeneous contamination distribution.
Reductions seen in air dose rates above flat, undisturbed fields in Fukushima
Prefecture are consistent with decrement by radioactive decay and downward
migration of cesium into soil. Analysis of remediation strategies for farmland
soils confirmed that topsoil removal and interchanging a topsoil layer with a
subsoil layer result in similar reductions in the air dose rate. These two
strategies are more effective than reverse tillage to invert and mix the
topsoil.

of magneto-optical trapping that arises when, in each beam of the MOT, two

the same transition. This mechanism produces a strong trapping force even when
the upper state has little or no Zeeman splitting. It is the main mechanism
responsible for the trapping force when the A$^{2}\Pi_{1/2}$ -

model is a Lotka-Volterra type model with a spatial component and is related to
two models studied in \cite{BlathEtheridgeMeredith2007} as well as to earlier

is on the diffusion limit of small mass, locally many individuals and rapid
reproduction. This system differs from spatial critical branching systems since
it is not density preserving and the densities for large times do not depend on
the initial distribution but mainly on the carrying capacities.
  We prove existence of the infinite particle model and the system of
interacting diffusions as solutions of martingale problems or systems of

Taking a Bayesian perspective, we proceed with a prior probability model for
all relevant unknown quantities, including, in particular, a prior probability
model on the binary indicators that characterize the latent haplotypes. Such
prior models are known as feature allocation models. Specifically, we define a
simplified version of the Indian buffet process, one of the most traditional

Indeed,
multiple scattering is necessary for the onset of the diffusive regime and such

long enough times, transport in an infinite thin slab is still determined by a
multiple scattering process whose complete characterization is lacking. In this
paper we show that, after a short transient, the mean square width of the
transmitted intensity still exhibits a simple linear increase with time as
predicted by diffusion theory, even at optical thickness as low as one.
Interestingly, such linear growth is predicted not to depend neither on the
slab thickness nor on its refractive index contrast, yet the accuracy of this
simple approximation in the ballistic-to-diffusive regime hasn't been
investigated so far. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we find clear
evidence that boundary conditions play an active role in redefining the very
asymptotic value of the diffusion coefficient by directly modifying the
statistical distributions underlying light transport in such media. In this

the smallest grains that can still stay in bound orbits despite the repelling
action of stellar radiation pressure. Thus the minimum (and typical) grain size
$s_\text{min}$ is expected to be close to the radiation pressure blowout size
$s_\text{blow}$. Yet a recent analysis of a sample of Herschel-resolved debris
discs showed the ratio $s_\text{min}/s_\text{blow}$ to systematically decrease
with the stellar luminosity from about ten for solar-type stars to nearly unity
in the discs around the most luminous A-type stars. Here we explore this trend
in more detail, checking how significant it is and seeking to find possible
explanations. We show that the trend is robust to variation of the composition
and porosity of dust particles. For any assumed grain properties and stellar
parameters, we suggest a recipe of how to estimate the ""true"" radius of a
spatially unresolved debris disc, based solely on its spectral energy
distribution. The results of our collisional simulations are qualitatively
consistent with the trend, although additional effects may also be at work. In
particular, the lack of grains with small $s_\text{min}/s_\text{blow}$ for
lower luminosity stars might be caused by the grain surface energy constraint
that should limit the size of the smallest collisional fragments. Also, a
better agreement between the data and the collisional simulations is achieved
when assuming debris discs of more luminous stars to have higher dynamical
excitation than those of less luminous primaries. This would imply that
protoplanetary discs of more massive young stars are more efficient in forming
big planetesimals or planets that act as stirrers in the debris discs at the
subsequent evolutionary stage.

investigate in detail the dark matter phenomenology of this model. We show that
the observed dark matter density can be obtained via gauge or scalar

latter case. The regions consistent with the dark matter density are determined

analyzed. If dark matter annihilations are controlled by the B-L gauge
interaction, the mass of the dark matter particle should lie below 5 TeV and
its direct detection cross section can be easily probed by XENON1T; if instead
they are controlled by scalar interactions, the dark matter mass can be much
larger and the detection prospects are less certain. Finally, we show that this

hybrid CR system approach is studied, according to which, the system either
operates as an interweave (i.e., opportunistic) or as an underlay (i.e.,

links are known by the multiple antenna receivers (RXs), while, merely
statistical (covariance) information is available for the interference links. A
new, closed form approximation is derived for the outage probability of primary

curvature, peaking in $E F_E$ at $\sim$1 GeV. We have also calculated the flux
upper limits in the mm-wavelength and X-ray ranges from Planck and XMM-Newton,
respectively. We have inspected the intensity of the CO (1$\rightarrow $0)
emission line and found a large peak at a velocity range corresponding to the
previously estimated source distance of $\sim$4 kpc, which may indicate an
association between a molecular cloud and the SNR. The gamma-ray emission
appears due to interaction of accelerated particles within the SNR with the
matter of the cloud. The most likely radiative process responsible for the
gamma-ray emission is decay of neutral pions produced in ion-ion collisions.
While a dominant leptonic origin of this emission can be ruled out, the
relativistic electron population related to the observed radio flux will
necessarily lead to a certain level of bremsstrahlung gamma-ray emission. Based
on this broad-band modelling, we have developed a method to estimate the
magnetic field, yielding $B\geq 80\,\mu$G at our best estimate of the molecular
cloud density (or less at a lower density). G73.9+0.9 appears similar, though

  arXiv:1307.8256",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, Software Transactional Memory systems (STMs) have garnered
significant interest as an elegant alternative for addressing concurrency
issues in memory. STM systems take optimistic approach. Multiple transactions
are allowed to execute concurrently. On completion, each transaction is
validated and if any inconsistency is observed it is aborted. Otherwise it is
allowed to commit.
  In databases a class of histories called as conflict-serializability (CSR)
based on the notion of conflicts have been identified, whose membership can be
efficiently verified. As a result, CSR is the commonly used correctness
criterion in databases. Similarly, using the notion of conflicts, a correctness
criterion, conflict-opacity (co-opacity) which is a sub-class of can be
designed whose membership can be verified in polynomial time. Using the
verification mechanism, an efficient STM implementation can be designed that is
permissive w.r.t co-opacity.
  By storing multiple versions for each transaction object, multi-version STMs
provide more concurrency than single-version STMs. But the main drawback of
co-opacity is that it does not admit histories that are uses multiple versions.
This has motivated us to develop a new conflict notions for multi-version STMs.
In this paper, we present a new conflict notion multi-version conflict. Using
this conflict notion, we identify a new subclass of opacity (a popular
correctness-criterion), mvc-opacity that admits multi-versioned histories and
whose membership can be verified in polynomial time. We show that co-opacity is
a proper subset of this class. The proposed conflict notion mv-conflict can be
applied on non-sequential histories as well unlike traditional conflicts.
Further, we believe that this conflict notion can be easily extended to other
correctness-criterion as well.

proves very effective in simulating the complex dynamics of strongly
interacting fluids (SIF). In particular, it is pointed out that the shear
viscosity of lattice fluids is the sum of two contributions, one due to the
usual interactions between particles (collision viscosity) and the other due to
the interaction with the discrete lattice (propagation viscosity). Since the
latter is {\it negative}, the sum may turn out to be orders of magnitude
smaller than each of the two contributions separately, thus providing a
mechanism to access SIF regimes at ordinary values of the collisional
viscosity. This concept, as applied to quantum superfluids in one-dimensional
optical lattices, is shown to reproduce shear viscosities consistent with the
AdS-CFT holographic bound on the viscosity/entropy ratio. This shows that
lattice kinetic theory continues to hold for strongly coupled hydrodynamic
regimes where continuum kinetic theory may no longer be applicable.

minimization problems involving non-quadratic cost functions, perhaps
non-convex and non-smooth, which however can be described as the infimum over a
family of quadratic functions. This transformation suggests an algorithmic
scheme that solves a sequence of quadratic problems to be tackled efficiently
by tools of numerical linear algebra. Its general scope and its usually simple
implementation, transforming the initial non-convex and non-smooth minimization
problem into a more familiar and easily solvable quadratic optimization
problem, make it a versatile algorithm. However, despite its simplicity,
versatility, and elegant analysis, the complexity of IRLS strongly depends on
the way the solution of the successive quadratic optimizations is addressed.
For the important special case of $\textit{compressed sensing}$ and sparse
recovery problems in signal processing, we investigate theoretically and
numerically how accurately one needs to solve the quadratic problems by means
of the $\textit{conjugate gradient}$ (CG) method in each iteration in order to
guarantee convergence. The use of the CG method may significantly speed-up the
numerical solution of the quadratic subproblems, in particular, when fast
matrix-vector multiplication (exploiting for instance the FFT) is available for
the matrix involved. In addition, we study convergence rates. Our modified IRLS
method outperforms state of the art first order methods such as Iterative Hard
Thresholding (IHT) or Fast Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) in
many situations, especially in large dimensions. Moreover, IRLS is often able
to recover sparse vectors from fewer measurements than required for IHT and
FISTA.

The contribution of this paper is to show that any Gaussian filter can be made

detected only through diagnostic tests. Due to cost considerations,
self-reported outcomes are routinely collected in lieu of expensive diagnostic
tests in large-scale prospective investigations such as the Women's Health
Initiative. However, self-reported outcomes are subject to imperfect
sensitivity and specificity. Using a semiparametric likelihood-based approach,
we present time to event models to estimate the association of one or more
covariates with a error-prone, self-reported outcome. We present simulation
studies to assess the effect of error in self-reported outcomes with regard to
bias in the estimation of the regression parameter of interest. We apply the
proposed methods to prospective data from 152,830 women enrolled in the Women's
Health Initiative to evaluate the effect of statin use with the risk of
incident diabetes mellitus among postmenopausal women. The current analysis is
based on follow-up through 2010, with a median duration of follow-up of 12.1
years. The methods proposed in this paper are readily implemented using our
freely available R software package icensmis, which is available at the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website.

effective densities and moduli of acoustic metamaterials. We introduce the
terminology of hidden force and hidden source of volume: the effective density
or modulus is negative when the hidden force or source of volume is larger
than, and operates in antiphase to, respectively, the force or volume change
that would be obtained in their absence. We demonstrate this ansatz for some
established acoustic metamaterials with elements based on membranes, Helmholtz
resonators, springs and masses. The hidden force for membrane-based acoustic
metamaterials, for instance, is the force from the membrane tension. The hidden
source for a Helmholtz-resonator-based metamaterial is the extra air volume
injected from the resonator cavity. We also explain the analogous concepts for
pure mass-and-spring systems, in which case hidden forces can arise from masses
and springs fixed inside other masses, whereas hidden sources - more aptly
termed hidden expanders of displacement in this case - can arise from light
rigid trusses coupled to extra degrees of freedom for mechanical motion such as
the case of coupling to masses that move at right angles to the
wave-propagation direction. This overall picture provides a powerful tool for
conceptual understanding and design of new acoustic metamaterials, and avoids
common pitfalls involved in determining the effective parameters of such
materials.

distribution depends on the solution to a system of non-linear ordinary
differential equations. The motivation is an experiment to estimate parameters
in the equations governing the transport of amino acids through cell membranes
in human placentas. Decision-theoretic Bayesian design of experiments for such
nonlinear models is conceptually very attractive, allowing the formal
incorporation of prior knowledge to overcome the parameter dependence of
frequentist design and being less reliant on asymptotic approximations.
However, the necessary approximation and maximization of the, typically
analytically intractable, expected utility results in a computationally
challenging problem. These issues are further exacerbated if the solution to
the differential equations is not available in closed-form. This paper proposes
a new combination of a probabilistic solution to the equations embedded within
a Monte Carlo approximation to the expected utility with cyclic descent of a
smooth approximation to find the optimal design. A novel precomputation
algorithm reduces the computational burden, making the search for an optimal
design feasible for bigger problems. The methods are demonstrated by finding

role of A group elements in Nb4AC3 (A= Al, Si, Ga, Ge) on various properties
were systematically investigated. Not only bulk moduli, compressibility, shear
moduli, and Youngs moduli, but the approach to the ductility was discussed and
raised as that the ductility can be achieved by forming Nb4AC3 containing more
heavier p electrons. All the studied Nb4AC3 phases exhibit the metallic nature
that results from the Nb-4d states being dominant at the Fermi level. The
typical 4d-2p hybridization between Nb-C leads to strong covalent bond and the
contribution from the weaker 4d-3p(4p) hybridization between Nb-A are also
identified. The p electrons in A elements can effectively alter the covalency
and the iconicity of the bonds that govern the compressibility, ductility and
even superconductive properties. The extremely high population at the Fermi
level in the density of states and the nesting effects in the Fermi surface
shown in Nb4SiC3 both bring this material to a potential superconductor. The
regular anisotropic behavior in the dielectric function is present but not in
Nb4SiC3. Furthermore, Nb4GeC3 was also predicted to be a very promising
candidate solar heating barrier material. The present work gives insight to the
role of A elements on the mechanical, superconducting and optical properties of

consistent with the experimental data, the black disk does not represent an
unique solution; (2) the data reductions favor a semi-transparent scenario,
with asymptotic average value for the ratio $\bar{X}$ = 0.30 $\pm$ 0.12. In

phase diagram as a function of the electron filling also exhibits metallic,
insulating line phases and regions of phase separation. We suggest that a SC
state is easily stabilized if $t\!\!-\!\!J$ segments creating local
spin-singlet pairing are coupled to each other -- another example is ladder

a wireless sensor network. Each node has an individual energy constraint and
the communication with the processing central units are affected by the path
loss propagation effect. Guided by energy efficiency concerns, we consider the
partition of the whole network into clusters, each one with a coordination node
or \emph{cluster head}. Thus, the nodes transmit their measurements to the
corresponding cluster heads, which after some processing, communicate a summary
of the received information to the fusion center, which takes the final
decision about the state of the nature. As the network has a fixed size,
communication within smaller clusters will be less affected by the path loss
effect, reducing energy consumption in the information exchange process between
nodes and cluster heads. However, this limits the capability of the network of
beneficially exploiting the spatial correlation of the process, specially when
the spatial correlation coherence of the process is of the same scale as the
clusters size. Therefore, a trade-off is established between the energy
efficiency and the beneficial use of spatial correlation. The study of this
trade-off is the main goal of this paper. We derive tight approximations of the
false alarm and miss-detection error probabilities under the Neyman-Pearson
framework for the above scenario. We also consider the application of these
results to a particular network and correlation model obtaining closed form
expressions. Finally, we validate the results for more general network and
correlation models through numerical simulations.

design problem can then be solved using synthesis tools for general linear
temporal logic or generalized reactivity(1) specifications. In this article, we
propose a new abstraction algorithm. Instead of generating a single FTS to
represent the system, we generate two FTSs, which are under- and
over-approximations of the original dynamical system. We further develop an
iterative abstraction scheme by exploiting the concept of winning sets, i.e.,
the sets of states for which there exists a winning strategy for the system.

predicted to reach a strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy which may compete
with shape anisotropy. Probing this theoretical suggestion experimentally,
epitaxial films are examined. A spontaneous strain up to 5 % lattice distortion

Source-II'' (LCLS-II) and the proposed Cornell Energy Recovery Linac (ERL)
require hundreds of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities operating in
continuous wave (CW) mode. In order to achieve economic feasibility of projects
such as these, the cavities must achieve a very high intrinsic quality factor
($Q_0$) to keep cryogenic losses within feasible limits. To reach these high
$Q_0$'s in the case of LCLS-II, nitrogen-doping has been proposed as a cavity
preparation technique. When dealing with $Q_0$'s greater than 1\e{10}, the
effects of ambient magnetic field on $Q_0$ become significant. Here we show
that the sensitivity to RF losses from trapped magnetic field in a cavity's
walls is strongly dependent on the cavity preparation. Specifically, standard
electropolished and 120$^\circ$C baked cavities show a residual resistance
sensitivity to trapped magnetic flux of $\sim0.6$ and $\sim0.8$ n$\Omega$/mG
trapped, respectively, while nitrogen-doped cavities show a sensitivity of
$\sim$ 1 to 5 n$\Omega$/mG trapped. We show that this difference in
sensitivities is directly related to the mean free path of the RF surface layer
of the niobium: shorter mean free paths lead to less residual resistance
sensitivity to trapped magnetic flux in the dirty limit ($\ell<<\xi_0$) while
longer mean free paths lead to lower sensitivity in the clean limit
($\ell>>\xi_0$). These experimental results are also shown to have good
agreement with recent theoretical predictions for pinned vortex lines

given fine thickness and length, a stability boundary here is a curve in the
parameter plane, aspect ratio vs. the macroscopic strain; the values on one
side of the boundary are associated with a flat, unwrinkled state, while
wrinkled configurations correspond to all values on the other. In our recent
work we demonstrated the importance of finite elasticity in the membrane part
of such a model in order to capture the correct phenomena. Here we present and
compare results for four distinct models:(i) the popular F\""oppl-von K\'arm\'an
plate model (FvK), (ii) a correction of the latter, used in our earlier work,
in which the approximate 2D F\""oppl strain tensor is replaced by the exact
Green strain tensor, (iii) and (iv): effective 2D finite-elasticity membrane
models based on 3D incompressible neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin materials,
respectively. In particular, (iii) and (iv) are superior models for elastomers.
The 2D nonlinear, hyperelastic models (ii)-(iv) all incorporate the same
quadratic bending energy used in FvK. Our results illuminate serious
shortcomings of the latter in this problem, while also pointing to inaccuracies
of model (ii), in spite of yielding the correct qualitative phenomena in our
earlier work. In each of these, the shortcoming is a due to a deficiency of the

length and spreading of liquid coatings on flexible substrates with high

standard gravity on earth, and to the authors' knowledge, this work is the
first to explore its relevance to spreading puddles under high gravity. By
using centrifugation with a high-density liquid base underneath a coated
substrate, it is possible to apply acceleration normal to a substrate to
decrease the capillary length and increase the rate of spreading. Due to the
nature of centrifugation, this method works primarily on flexible substrates,
which bend with a curvature that conforms to a contour of uniformly distributed
centrifugal acceleration. With high gravity of 600 g applied, the capillary
length reduces by a factor of 24.5, and the spreading shifts from ""transient
spreading"" between the surface tension-driven and gravity-driven regimes to the
gravity-driven regime. Experimental results show that high gravitational
acceleration will enhance the rate of spreading such that a puddle, which would
require 12 hours under standard gravity on earth to go from an 8-{\mu}l droplet
to a 40-{\mu}m thick puddle, would require less than 1 minute under 600 g.
Overall, this work suggests that previously derived expressions for
gravity-driven spreading of puddles under earth's standard gravity extend to
predicting the behavior of puddles spreading on smooth, wetting substrates
exposed to more than 100 g's of acceleration.

separate single-qubit rotations for all gate times beyond a quantum speed

spacecraft has revealed the richness of the surface of Titan, as numerous seas,
lakes, rivers, cryo-volcanic flows and vast dune fields have been discovered.
Linear dunes are a major geomorphological feature present on Titan, covering up
to 17% of its surface, mainly in equatorial regions. However, the resolution of
the RADAR instrument is not good enough to allow a detailed study of the
morphology of these features. In addition, other linear wind-related landforms,
such as mega-yardangs (linear wind-abraded ridges formed in cohesive rocks),
are likely to present a comparable radar signature that could be confused with
the one of dunes. We conducted a comparative study of the radar radiometry of
both linear dunes and mega-yardangs, based on representative terrestrial
analogues: the linear dunes located in the Great Sand Sea in western Egypt and
in the Namib Desert in Namibia, and the mega-yardangs observed in the Lut
Desert in eastern Iran and in the Borkou Desert in northern Chad. We analysed
the radar scattering of both terrestrial linear dunes and mega-yardangs, using
high-resolution radar images acquired by the X-band (9.6 GHz - 3.1 cm) sensor
of the TerraSAR-X satellite. Variations seen in the radar response of dunes are
the result of a contrast between the dune and interdune scattering, while for
mega-yardangs these variations are the result of a contrast between ridges and
erosion valleys. We tested a simple surface scattering model, with parameters
derived from the local topography and surface roughness estimates, to
accurately reproduce the radar signal variations for both landforms. It appears
that we can discriminate between two types of dunes - bare interdunes as in
Egypt and sand-covered interdunes as in Namibia, and between two types of
mega-yardangs - young yardangs...

on the medium access control (MAC) layer throughput and on proper resource

frame, using lifting based 9/7 filter bank through the row rocessor (RP) in row

To reduce the temporal memory and the latency, the temporal processor (TP) has
been designed with lifting based 1-D Haar wavelet filter. The proposed
architecture replaced the multiplications by pipeline shift-add operations to
reduce the CPD. Two spatial processors works simultaneously on two adjacent
frames and provide 2-D DWT coefficients as inputs to the temporal processors.
TPs apply the one dimensional DWT in temporal direction and provide eight 3-D

computing cycles per frame and enable the lower power consumption.
Implementation results shows that the proposed architecture has the advantage
in reduced memory, low power consumption, low latency, and high throughput over
the existing designs. The RTL of the proposed architecture is described using
verilog and synthesized using 90-nm technology CMOS standard cell library and

a reasonable level of security. Encryption of the video component involves

using the Discrete Cosine Transform. Combining these techniques, an efficient

that evolve a time-dependent basis so that it optimally approximates the most

relevant not only for fundamental Physics, but also for geophysical processes
and construction on sediments or granular soils in areas potentially affected
by earthquakes. While the penetration of intruders in two dimensional (2D)
laboratory granular beds can be followed using video recording, it is useless
in three dimensional (3D) beds of non-transparent materials such as common
sand. Here we propose a method to quantify the sink dynamics of an intruder
into laterally shaken granular beds based on the temporal correlations between
the signals from a reference accelerometer fixed to the shaken granular bed,
and a probe accelerometer deployed inside the intruder. Due to its analogy with
the working principle of a lock in amplifier, we call this technique Lock in
accelerometry (LIA). During Earthquakes, some soils can lose their ability to
sustain shear and deform, causing subsidence and sometimes substantial building
damage due to deformation or tumbling

  Technologies, Nov 2014, Hong Kong, China. 2014",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  CODYRUN is a multi-zone software integrating thermal building simulation,
airflow, and pollutant transfer. A first question thus arose as to the
integration of indoor lighting conditions into the simulation, leading to a new
model calculating natural and artificial lighting. The results of this new
daylighting module were then compared with results of other simulation codes
and experimental cases both in artificial and natural environments. Excellent
agreements were obtained, such as the values for luminous efficiencies in a
tropical and humid climate. In this paper, a comparison of the model output
with detailed measures is presented using a dedicated test cell in Reunion
Island (French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean), thus confirming the
interest for thermal and daylighting designs in low-energy buildings.
Introduction Several software packages are available for thermal and airflow
simulation in buildings. The most frequently used are ENERGY+ [1], ESP-r [2],
and TRNSYS [3]. These applications allow an increasing number of models to be
integrated, such as airflow, pollutant transport, and daylighting. In the
latter category, we may note ENERGY+, ESP-r and ECOTECT [4] software. After
more than 20 years of developing a specific code named CODYRUN, we decided to
add a lighting module to our software. This paper therefore provides some
details on this evolution and elements of validation. The CODYRUN initial
software and its validation Developed by the Physics and Mathematical
Engineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment at the University of Reunion
Island, CODYRUN [5-14] is a multi-zone software program integrating ventilation
and moisture transport transfer in buildings. The software employs a zone
approach based on nodal analysis and resolves a coupled system describing
thermal and airflow phenomena. Numerous validation tests of the CODYRUN code
were successfully applied to the software. Apart from the daylighting model,
the majority applied the BESTEST procedure [15]. The International Energy
Agency (IEA) sponsors a number of programs to improve the use and associated
technologies of energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
developed BESTEST, which is a method based on comparative testing of building
simulation programs, on the IEA's behalf. The procedure consists of a series of
test cases buildings that are designed to isolate individual aspects of
building energy and test the extremes of a program. As the modelling approach
is very different between codes, the test cases are specified so that input
equivalency can be defined thus allowing the different cases to be modelled by
most of codes. The basis for comparison is a range of results from a number of
programs considered to be a state-of-art in United States and Europe.
Associated with other specific comparisons, a very confident level of
validation was obtained for the CODYRUN initial software [8].

azide (p-AgN$_{3}$) by performing state-of-the-art first principles

monolayer crystal structures composed entirely of pentagons. In addition,
electronic band dispersion calculations indicate that while p-graphene and
p-AgN$_{3}$ are semiconductors with indirect bandgaps, p-BN structures display
metallic behavior. We also investigate the mechanical properties (in-plane
stiffness and the Poisson's ratio) of four different pentagonal structures
under uniaxial strain. p-graphene is found to have the highest stiffness value
and the corresponding Poisson's ratio is found to be negative. Similarly,
p-B$_{2}$N$_{4}$ and p-B$_{4}$N$_{2}$ have negative Poisson's ratio values. On
the other hand, the p-AgN$_{3}$ has a large and positive Poisson's ratio. In
dynamical stability tests based on calculated phonon spectra of these
pentagonal monolayers, we find that only p-graphene and p-B$_{2}$N$_{4}$ are
stable, but p-AgN$_{3}$ and p-B$_{4}$N$_{2}$ are vulnerable against vibrational
excitations.
