generation Internet. Traditionally, these networks have been designed with the
goals of traffic offload and the improvement of users' quality of experience
(QoE), but the energy consumption is also becoming an indispensable design
factor for CDNs to be a sustainable solution. To study and improve the CDN
architectures using this new design metric, we are planning to develop a
generic and flexible simulation package in OMNet++. This package is aimed to
render a holistic view about the CDN energy consumption behaviour by
incorporating the state-of-the-art energy consumption models proposed for the
individual elements of CDNs (e.g. servers, routers, wired and wireless links,
wireless devices, etc.) and for the various Internet contents (web pages,
files, streaming video, etc.).

$d(v)$ is the degree of a vertex $v$ of the underling molecular graph $G$. The
first sum was later named {\it first Zagreb index} and over the years became
one of the most investigated graph--based molecular structure descriptors. On
the other hand, the second sum, except in very few works on the general first
Zagreb index and the zeroth--order general Randi\'c index, has been almost
completely neglected. Recently, this second sum was named {\em forgotten
index}, or shortly the $F$-{\em index}, and shown to have an exceptional
applicative potential. In this paper we examine the trees extremal with respect
to the $F$-index.

one was theoretically uncovered in another material. In this work we reveal it
for wire media and prove the possibility to combine both these transitions with

one of humankind's greatest intellectual achievements. A quantitative
understanding of dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated
rapid development of knowledge and enabled advanced technological achievements,
including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. In
this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with
nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing physical equations from
measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that
there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the
equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds
for many physical systems. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine
the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately
represent the data. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model
complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. We demonstrate
the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems,
including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to
the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the
ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that
took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that
this method generalizes to parameterized, time-varying, or externally forced
systems.

result of competing interactions, with both itinerant and local electrons
playing important roles. Investigating this material has proven to be a

""magnetically hidden order"" phase, which remained elusive to neutron-scattering
investigations for many years. It was not until the development of modern x-ray

results are obtained by introducing a new formulation for analysing DTDGs using
the concept of a conjectured state by the players. In this formulation, the
state of the game is modelled as dependent on players. Using this formulation
we show that there is an optimisation problem such that the solution of this

progress of satellite image analytics has also been inhibited by the lack of a

contributions of this paper are twofold - (1) first, we present two new
satellite datasets called SAT-4 and SAT-6, and (2) then, we propose a
classification framework that extracts features from an input image, normalizes
them and feeds the normalized feature vectors to a Deep Belief Network for
classification. On the SAT-4 dataset, our best network produces a
classification accuracy of 97.95% and outperforms three state-of-the-art object
recognition algorithms, namely - Deep Belief Networks, Convolutional Neural
Networks and Stacked Denoising Autoencoders by ~11%. On SAT-6, it produces a
classification accuracy of 93.9% and outperforms the other algorithms by ~15%.
Comparative studies with a Random Forest classifier show the advantage of an
unsupervised learning approach over traditional supervised learning techniques.
A statistical analysis based on Distribution Separability Criterion and

formulate the GEAR strategy as a mixed integer linear programming problem,

  We show that unlike the Newtonian ($\epsilon=0$) case, in the second grade
model ($\epsilon \neq 0$ case), the time independent base flow exhibits
transitions as the Reynolds number $R$ exceeds the critical threshold $R_c
\approx 4.124 \epsilon^{-1/4}$ where $\epsilon$ is a material constant

inertial effects.
  At $R=R_c$, we find that generically the transition is either continuous or
catastrophic and a small amplitude, time periodic flow with 3-fold azimuthal
symmetry bifurcates. The time period of the bifurcated solution tends to
infinity as $R$ tends to $R_c$. Our numerical calculations suggest that for low
$\epsilon$ values, the system prefers a catastrophic transition where the
bifurcation is subcritical.

the state represents hosts blacklisted by a firewall, then traffic that should
be blocked may be allowed to pass through. Techniques based on record and
replay can reconstruct state automatically, but they are expensive to deploy
and can lead to incorrect behavior. Problematic scenarios are especially likely
to arise in distributed controllers and with semantics-altering updates.
  This paper presents a new approach to implementing dynamic controller updates
based on explicit state transfer. Instead of attempting to infer state changes
automatically-an approach that is expensive and fundamentally incomplete-our
framework gives programmers effective tools for implementing correct updates
that avoid major disruptions. We develop primitives that enable programmers to
directly (and easily, in most cases) initialize the new controller's state as a
function of old state and we design protocols that ensure consistent behavior
during the transition. We also present a prototype implementation called
Morpheus, and evaluate its effectiveness on representative case studies.

main channel is currently an open problem. Herein its secrecy-capacity is
derived and shown to be equal to its semantic-security (SS) capacity. In this
setting, the legitimate users communicate via a discrete-memoryless (DM)
channel in the presence of an eavesdropper that has perfect access to a subset
of its choosing of the transmitted symbols, constrained to a fixed fraction of
the blocklength. The secrecy criterion is achieved simultaneously for all
possible eavesdropper subset choices. The SS criterion demands negligible
mutual information between the message and the eavesdropper's observations even
when maximized over all message distributions.
  A key tool for the achievability proof is a novel and stronger version of
Wyner's soft covering lemma. Specifically, a random codebook is shown to
achieve the soft-covering phenomenon with high probability. The probability of
failure is doubly-exponentially small in the blocklength. Since the combined
number of messages and subsets grows only exponentially with the blocklength,
SS for the WTC II is established by using the union bound and invoking the
stronger soft-covering lemma. The direct proof shows that rates up to the
weak-secrecy capacity of the classic WTC with a DM erasure channel (EC) to the
eavesdropper are achievable. The converse follows by establishing the capacity
of this DM wiretap EC as an upper bound for the WTC II. From a broader
perspective, the stronger soft-covering lemma constitutes a tool for showing
the existence of codebooks that satisfy exponentially many constraints, a
beneficial ability for many other applications in information theoretic
security.

it is larger by a factor equal to the number of clusters. The empirical

framework, the geometry variations, which can be chosen arbitrarily, serve as
probes to investigate the gravitational contraction processes from various

  We apply the obtained framework to the case of conformal geometry variations,
characterized by an arbitrary function $f(x)$, and see that the formulas get
simplified to a great extent. We investigate the response of the convergence
properties of geodesics in the latest phase of gravitational contractions by
restricting the class of conformal geometry variations to the one satisfying
the strong energy condition. We then find out that in the final stage, $f$ and
$ {\bf D}\cdot {\bf D} f$ control the overall contraction behavior and that the
contraction rate gets larger when $f$ is negative and $|f|$ is so large as to
overwhelm $|{\bf D} \cdot {\bf D} f|$. (Here ${\bf D} \cdot {\bf D}$ is the

superpositions of point-like electric charges characterized by $m$-dimensional
bosonic SPT wavefunctions. There exist gapped boundaries where electric charges
or magnetic fluxes may not condense by themselves, but may condense only when
accompanied by fluctuating charges. Magnetic fluxes and codimension-$2$

involving more than two excitations. The statistical angle can be computed by
taking slant products of underlying cocycle functions sequentially. We find
that excitations that may condense into a gapped boundary can be characterized
by trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics, generalizing the notion of the

that we observe a different disk/spheroid fraction versus obscuration indicates
that viewing angle cannot be the only thing differentiating our three AGN

disturbed morphologies with obscuration supports an evolutionary scenario, in
which Compton-thick AGN are a distinct phase of obscured SMBH growth following

accuracy of their simulations based on ad-hoc proxies, e.g., the existence of
small-scale structures. This paper proposes well-posed Kelvin-Helmholtz
problems with smooth initial conditions and explicit diffusion. We show that in
many cases numerical errors/noise can seed spurious small-scale structure in
Kelvin-Helmholtz problems. We demonstrate convergence to a reference solution
using both Athena, a Godunov code, and Dedalus, a pseudo-spectral code.
Problems with constant initial density throughout the domain are relatively
straightforward for both codes. However, problems with an initial density jump
(which are the norm in astrophysical systems) exhibit rich behavior and are
more computationally challenging. In the latter case, Athena simulations are
prone to an instability of the inner rolled-up vortex; this instability is
seeded by grid-scale errors introduced by the algorithm, and disappears as
resolution increases. Both Athena and Dedalus exhibit late-time chaos. Inviscid
simulations are riddled with extremely vigorous secondary instabilities which
induce more mixing than simulations with explicit diffusion. Our results
highlight the importance of running well-posed test problems with demonstrated
convergence to a reference solution. To facilitate future comparisons, we
include the resolved, converged solutions to the Kelvin-Helmholtz problems in
this paper in machine-readable form.

thickness, however, we observe that MoTe$_2$ behaves differently from other
semiconducting TMDs investigated earlier. Specifically, the exciton PL yield
(integrated PL intensity) is identical for mono and bilayer and it starts
decreasing for trilayers. A quantitative analysis of this behavior and of all
our experimental observations is fully consistent with mono and bilayer
MoTe$_2$ being direct band-gap semiconductors, with tetralayer MoTe$_2$ being
an indirect gap semiconductor, and with trilayers having nearly identical
direct and indirect gaps.This conclusion is different from the one reached for
other recently investigated semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides,
for which only monolayers are found to be direct band-gap semiconductors, with
thicker layers having indirect band gaps that are significantly smaller, by
hundreds of meV, than the direct gap. We discuss the relevance of our findings

formation rate - stellar mass plane. We find that galaxies form a sequence from
the `blue cloud' galaxies which are actively forming stars, through a

supports an evolutionary pathway for galaxies in which star formation quenching

SN explosion, the companion may suffer from mass stripping and be shock heated

the companion is ejected as a runaway and hypervelocity star. By performing a
series of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the collision of SN ejecta with the
companion star, we investigate how CCSN explosions affect their companions. We
use the BEC code to construct the detailed companion structure at the time of
SN explosion. The impact of the SN blast wave on the companion is followed by
means of 3D SPH simulations using the Stellar GADGET code. For main-sequence
(MS) companions, we find that the amount of removed mass, impact velocity, and
chemical contamination of the companion that results from the impact of the SN
ejecta, strongly increases with decreasing binary separation and increasing
explosion energy. Their relationship can be approximately fitted by power laws,
which is consistent with the results obtained from impact simulations of
SNe~Ia. However, we find that the impact velocity is sensitive to the momentum
profile of the outer SN ejecta and, in fact, may decrease with increasing
ejecta mass, depending on the modeling of the ejecta. Because most companions
to Ib/c CCSNe are in their MS phase at the moment of the explosion, combined
with the strongly decaying impact effects with increasing binary separation, we
argue that the majority of these SNe lead to inefficient mass stripping and
shock heating of the companion star following the impact of the ejecta. Our
simulations show that the impact effects of Ib/c SN ejecta on the structure of
MS companions, and thus their long-term post-explosion evolution, is in general
not dramatic. We find that at most 10% of their mass is lost, and their
resulting impact velocities are less than 100 km/s.

challenges to our understanding of quasar accretion. To better understand this
phenomenon, we take a first step to building a sample of changing-look quasars

analysis of the broad emission lines suggest that the quasar accretion disk
emission dims due to rapidly decreasing accretion rates (by factors of >2.5),
while disfavoring changes in intrinsic dust extinction for the two objects
where these analyses are possible. Broad emission line energetics also support
intrinsic dimming of quasar emission as the origin for this phenomenon rather
than transient tidal disruption events or supernovae. Although our search
criteria included quasars at all redshifts and transitions from either
quasar-like to galaxy-like states or the reverse, all of the clear cases of

measurements of the [O II]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729 and [S

$\sim250$ cm$^{-3}$ at $z\sim2.3$, an increase of an order of magnitude
compared to measurements of galaxies at $z\sim0$. While $z\sim2.3$ galaxies are
offset towards significantly higher O$_{32}$ values relative to local galaxies
at fixed stellar mass, we find that the high-redshift sample follows a similar
distribution to the low-metallicity tail of the local distribution in the
O$_{32}$ vs. R$_{23}$ and O3N2 diagrams. Based on these results, we propose
that $z\sim2.3$ star-forming galaxies have the same ionization parameter as
local galaxies at fixed metallicity. In combination with simple photoionization
models, the position of local and $z\sim2.3$ galaxies in excitation diagrams
suggests that there is no significant change in the hardness of the ionizing
spectrum at fixed metallicity from $z\sim0$ to $z\sim2.3$. We find that
$z\sim2.3$ galaxies show no offset compared to low-metallicity local galaxies
in emission line ratio diagrams involving only lines of hydrogen, oxygen, and
sulfur, but show a systematic offset in diagrams involving [N II]$\lambda$6584.
We conclude that the offset of $z\sim2.3$ galaxies from the local star-forming
sequence in the [N II] BPT diagram is primarily driven by elevated N/O at fixed
O/H compared to local galaxies. These results suggest that the local gas-phase
and stellar metallicity sets the ionization state of star-forming regions at
$z\sim0$ and $z\sim2$.

collapsing gaseous structures captured while cooling is becoming effective in
lowering the temperature below $\sim 10^4\,\rm K$, before they are disrupted by
episodes of star formation or tidal effects. Our theoretical results agree with

[O/Fe], [Si/O], [Fe/H], [O/H] at redshifts $z\sim 2-7$. Correlations between HI

result of the increasing cosmic star formation activity from $z\sim 6$ to

different stellar phases or belonging to different stellar populations.
Simulated synthetic spectra support the existence of metal-poor cold clumps

wavepacket dynamics, the extent of the wavepacket in momentum space needs to be
taken into account. The dynamics is sensitive to the interplay of band
dispersion and Berry curvature over the finite region of momentum (reciprocal)
space where the wavepacket has support. Moreover, if the wavepacket is prepared
with a finite initial momentum, the semiclassical analysis reproduces its
motion as long as it has a large overlap with the eigenstates of a single band.
The semiclassical description generally improves with increasing real-space
size of the wavepacket, as long as the external conditions (e.g., external
force) remain uniform throughout the spatial extent of the wavepacket.

whose blue continua and broad optical emission lines have been observed to
decline by a large factor on a time scale of approximately a decade. The 5100
Angstrom monochromatic continuum luminosity of this quasar drops by a factor of
> 9.8 in a rest-frame time interval of < 9.7 years, while the broad H-alpha
luminosity drops by a factor of 55 in the same amount of time. The width of the
broad H-alpha line increases in the dim state such that the black hole mass
derived from the appropriate single-epoch scaling relation agrees between the
two epochs within a factor of 3. The fluxes of the narrow emission lines do not
appear to change between epochs. The light curve obtained by the Catalina Sky
Survey suggests that the transition occurs within a rest-frame time interval of
approximately 500 days. We examine three possible mechanisms for this
transition suggested in the recent literature. An abrupt change in the
reddening towards the central engine is disfavored by the substantial
difference between the timescale to obscure the central engine and the observed
timescale of the transition. A decaying tidal disruption flare is consistent
with the decay rate of the light curve but not with the prolonged bright state
preceding the decay, nor can this scenario provide the power required by the
luminosities of the emission lines. An abrupt drop in the accretion rate onto
the supermassive black hole appears to be the most plausible explanation for
the rapid dimming.

networks of drug-sensitive parental cell lines and their drug-resistant

exhibit higher degrees of overall network robustness (e.g., the ability of a
system to withstand random perturbations to its network configuration) to that
of their untreated or short-term (72-hour) treated samples. This was done by
leveraging previous work, which suggests that Ricci curvature, a key geometric
feature of a given network, is positively correlated to increased network
robustness. More importantly, given that Ricci curvature is a local property of

Ramanujan tau arithmetic function. For both classes we prove that if a
particular trigonometric series involving sums of multiplicative characters
over primes is $O(\sqrt{N})$, then the Euler product converges in the right

equation, the non-trivial zeros are constrained to lie on the critical line. We
argue that this $\sqrt{N}$ growth is a consequence of the series behaving like
a one-dimensional random walk. Based on these results we obtain an equation

Bouchet & Gispert (1999), to estimate variation of spectral index of galactic
polarized synchrotron emission, using linear combination of simulated Stokes Q
polarization maps of selected frequency bands from WMAP and Planck observations
on a region of sky dominated by the synchrotron Stokes Q signal. We find that,
a first order perturbative analysis recovers input spectral index map well.
Along with the spectral index variation map our method provides a fixed
reference index, \hat \beta_{0s}, over the sky portion being analyzed. Using
Monte Carlo simulations we find that, <\hat \beta_{0s}> = -2.84 \pm 0.01, which
matches very closely with position of a peak at \beta_s(p) = -2.85, of
empirical probability density function of input synchrotron indices, obtained
from the same sky region. For thermal dust, mean recovered spectral index,
<\hat \beta_d> = 2.00 \pm 0.004, from simulations, matches very well with
spatially fixed input thermal dust spectral index \beta_d = 2.00. As
accompanying results of the method we also reconstruct CMB, thermal dust and a
synchrotron template component with fixed spectral indices over the {\it
entire} sky region. We use full pixel-pixel noise covariance matrices of all
frequency bands, estimated from the sky region being analyzed, to obtain
reference spectral indices for synchrotron and thermal dust, spectral index
variation map, CMB map, thermal dust and synchrotron template components. The
perturbative technique as implemented in this work has the interesting property
that it can build a model to describe the data with an arbitrary but enough
degree of accuracy (and precession) as allowed by the data. We argue that, our
method of reference spectral index determination, CMB map, thermal dust and
synchrotron template component reconstruction is a maximum likelihood method.

emergence of a broken symmetry. Here, we report the existence of such a

telescopes is their effective area as a function of the X-ray energy. The
computation of the effective area of a Wolter-I mirror, with either a single
layer or multilayer coating, is a very simple task for a source on-axis at
astronomical distance. Indeed, when the source moves off-axis the calculation
is more complicated, in particular for new hard X-ray imaging telescopes
(NuSTAR, ASTRO-H, NHXM, IXO) beyond 10 keV, that will make use of multilayer
coatings to extend the reflectivity band in grazing incidence. Unlike
traditional single-layer coatings (in Ir or Au), graded multilayer coatings
exhibit an oscillating reflectivity as a function of the incidence angle, which
makes the effective area not immediately predictable for a source placed
off-axis within the field of view. For this reason, the computation of the
off-axis effective area has been so far demanded to ray- tracing codes, able to
sample the incidence of photons onto the mirror assembly. Even if this approach
should not be disdained, it would be interesting to approach the same problem
from an analytical viewpoint. This would speed up and simplify the computation
of the effective area as a function of the off-axis angle, a considerable
advantage especially whenever the mirror parameters are still to be optimized.
In this work we present the application of a novel, analytical formalism to the
computation of the off-axis effective area and the grasp of the NHXM optical
modules, requiring only the standard routines for the multilayer reflectivity
computation.

molecules have reportedly enhanced their anti-bacterial activity in connection
with tail length and the nature of the head group, but their ability to produce
and stabilize foam is mostly unknown. Here we report on experiments with
tris-cationic, triple-headed, double- and single-tailed amphiphiles and their
foamability and foam stability with respect to head group, tail number and tail
length. The amphiphiles are composed of an aromatic mesitylene core and three
benzylic amonium bromide groups, with alkyl chains attached to one or two of
the head groups. Whereas shorter (14 carbons in length) double-tailed molecules
are found to produce very stable foams, foams made with single tail molecules
of the same length show poor foamability and stability, and foams with longer
(16 carbons in length) double-tail molecules do not foam with the methods used.
By contrast, the structure of the non-tail-bearing head group
(trimethylammonium vs. pyridinium) has no impact on foamability. Furthermore,
observations of the coarsening rate at nearly constant liquid content indicate
that the enhanced foam stability is a result of lower gas permeability through
the surfactant monolayer. Finally, the critical aggregation concentration (CAC)
of the surfactants demonstrates to be a good predictor of foamability and foam
stability for these small molecule surfactants. This results inform how
surfactant architecture can be tailored to produce stable foams.

this type of SRF ERL an electron bunch is passing through accelerating and

the BBU start current in such an asymmetric ERL via analytical and numerical

by simulating Au + Au collisions from 0.8 to 1.8$A$ GeV in a framework of an
isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics (IQMD) model. $R_{cp}$ of protons
rises with the increase of \pt~ at different beam energies owing to radial flow
and Cronin effect. The rate of increase of \rcp~ is suppressed at higher beam
energies. The significant difference of $R_{cp}$ between protons and pions
indicates different medium effects between protons and pions. By changing the
in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, the $R_{cp}$ of protons changes a lot,
while the $R_{cp}$ of pions does not. Taking the pion absorption into account,
the $R_{cp}$ of pions becomes close to unity without $p_{T}$ dependence after
deactivating the reaction $\pi N \rightarrow \Delta$, while there is nearly no
change on proton. This suggests that the pion absorption plays a dominant role
on pion dynamics and have slight effect for proton dynamics.

dimensions of residential segregation, such as the spatial arrangement of
segregated neighborhoods and the geographic scale or relative size of
segregated areas. However, the methods used to measure segregation do not
incorporate features of the built environment, such as the road connectivity
between locations or the physical barriers that divide groups. This article
introduces the Spatial Proximity and Connectivity (SPC) method for measuring
and analyzing segregation. The SPC method addresses the limitations of current
approaches by taking into account how the physical structure of the built
environment affects the proximity and connectivity of locations. In this
article, I describe the method and its application for studying segregation and
spatial inequality more broadly. I demonstrate one such application-analyzing
the impact of physical barriers on residential segregation-with a stylized
example and an empirical analysis of racial segregation in Pittsburgh, PA. The
SPC method contributes to scholarship on residential segregation by capturing
the effect of an important yet understudied mechanism of segregation-the
connectivity, or physical barriers, between locations-on the level and spatial
pattern of segregation, and enables further consideration of the role of the
built environment in segregation processes.

so-called intermediate line region; (ii) The unexplained anticorrelations of
the optical Fe II (EW Fe II$_{opt}$) versus EW [O III] 5007 \AA\ and EW Fe

(iii) The significant averaged redshift in the UV Fe II lines, which is not

anticorrelation between the intensity ratio of the optical and UV Fe II lines

different directions are dependent on the polarization status of terahertz

elements with elaborately-designed digital sequences (in both 1 bit and 2

independently in three dimensions. The simulated far-field scattering patterns
as well as near-electric-field distributions are given to illustrate the
bifunctional performance of the encoded metasurface, which show good agreement
to the measurement results. We further demonstrate the abilities of anisotropic
coding metasurface to generate beam splitter and realize anomalous reflection

beam behaviors under orthogonal polarizations using a single metasurface, and
hence will promise interesting terahertz devices.

that there is a strong correlation between the BAL-trough EW and the spectral
index, and a weak negative correlation between the BAL-trough EW and the
continuum luminosity. The strong correlation between the BAL-trough EW and the
spectral index for this one QSO suggests that dust is intrinsic to outflows.

of SSFR in M51 is not symmetrical with respect to the long slit in STIS. This
unsymmetrical SSFR distribution is possibly due to the unsymmetrical AGN

  high-dimensional regression",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian shrinkage methods have generated a lot of recent interest as tools
for high-dimensional regression and model selection. These methods naturally
facilitate tractable uncertainty quantification and incorporation of prior
information. This benefit has led to extensive use of the Bayesian shrinkage
methods across diverse applications. A common feature of these models is that
the corresponding priors on the regression coefficients can be expressed as
scale mixture of normals. While the three-step Gibbs sampler used to sample
from the often intractable associated posterior density has been shown to be
geometrically ergodic for several of these models, it has been demonstrated
recently that convergence of this sampler can still be quite slow in modern
high-dimensional settings despite this apparent theoretical safeguard. We
propose a new method to draw from the same posterior via a tractable two-step
blocked Gibbs sampler. We demonstrate that our proposed two-step blocked
sampler exhibits vastly superior convergence behavior compared to the original
three-step sampler in high-dimensional regimes on both real and simulated data.
We also provide a detailed theoretical underpinning to the new method in the
context of the Bayesian lasso. First, we prove that the proposed two-step
sampler is geometrically ergodic, and derive explicit upper bounds for the
(geometric) rate of convergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that
while the original Bayesian lasso chain is not Hilbert-Schmidt, the proposed
chain is trace class (and hence Hilbert-Schmidt). The trace class property
implies that the corresponding Markov operator is compact, and its (countably
many) eigenvalues are summable. It also facilitates a rigorous comparison of
the two-step blocked chain with ""sandwich"" algorithms which aim to improve
performance of the two-step chain by inserting an inexpensive extra step.

Colour maps may also have perceptual discontinuities that induce the appearance

developed in detail. To support this work two test images for evaluating colour

Euclidean-time simulations. Combining an effective description for heavy quarks
with finite temperature lattice QCD we compute in-medium spectra providing
insight in heavy quarkonium melting in a static thermal medium. On the other

symmetries $Z_{3L}\otimes Z_{3R}$. It can simultaneously accommodate the
standard model, neutrino physics and the baryon asymmetry. The fermion masses
and $CP$ violation originate from vacuum spontaneous breaking of the flavor
field. The baryon asymmetry is implemented through the leptogenesis which is
related to the lepton $CP$ violation. The model can naturally and correctly
reproduce all kinds of experimental data, in particular, all of the values of
the fermion masses and mixings are accurately fitted by the fewer parameters.
Finally, it is also feasible and promising to test the model in future

dynamic nature of memory access pattern and the fixed behavior of address

scheme, means that DRAM performance cannot be exploited efficiently. DReAM is a
novel hardware technique that can detect a workload-specific address mapping at

commercial applications, which fuels an exponential explosion of sensory data.
However, a major challenge to deploy effective sensing systems is the presence
of {\em massive missing entries, measurement noise, and anomaly readings}.
Existing works assume that sensory data matrices have low-rank structures. This
does not hold in reality due to anomaly readings, causing serious performance
degradation. In this paper, we introduce an {\em LS-Decomposition} approach for
robust sensory data recovery, which decomposes a corrupted data matrix as the
superposition of a low-rank matrix and a sparse anomaly matrix. First, we prove
that LS-Decomposition solves a convex program with bounded approximation error.
Second, using data sets from the IntelLab, GreenOrbs, and NBDC-CTD projects, we
find that sensory data matrices contain anomaly readings. Third, we propose an
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm and prove that it approximates the
optimal solution with convergence rate $O(1/k^2)$ ($k$ is the number of
iterations). Evaluations on real data sets show that our scheme achieves
recovery error $\leq 5\%$ for sampling rate $\geq 50\%$ and almost exact
recovery for sampling rate $\geq 60\%$, while state-of-the-art methods have
error $10\% \sim 15\%$ at sampling rate $90\%$.

(SN) 2011fu from a few days to $\sim300$ d after explosion. The SN presents a
double-peaked light curve (LC) similar to that of SN 1993J, although more
luminous and with a longer cooling phase after the primary peak. The spectral
evolution is also similar to SN 1993J's, with hydrogen dominating the spectra
to $\sim40$ d, then helium gaining strength, and nebular emission lines
appearing from $\sim60$ d post-explosion. The velocities derived from the
P-Cygni absorptions are overall similar to those of other type IIb SNe. We have
found a strong similarity between the oxygen and magnesium line profiles at
late times, which suggests that these lines are forming at the same location
within the ejecta. The hydrodynamical modelling of the pseudo-bolometric LC and
the observed photospheric velocities suggest that SN 2011fu was the explosion
of an extended star ($\rm R\sim450$ R$_\odot$), in which 1.3 $\times 10^{51}$
erg of kinetic energy were released and 0.15 M$_{\rm \odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni were
synthesised. In addition, a better reproduction of the observed early
pseudo-bolometric LC is achieved if a more massive H-rich-envelope than for
other type IIb SNe is considered (0.3 M$_{\rm \odot}$). The hydrodynamical
modelling of the LC and the comparison of our late-time spectra with nebular
spectral models for type IIb SNe, point to a progenitor for SN 2011fu with a
ZAMS mass of 13-18 M$_{\rm \odot}$.

  commercial bees and pesticide use","Working paper",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The decline in extent of wild pollinators in recent years has been partly
associated with changing farm practices and in particular with increasing
pesticide use. In this paper we combine ecological modelling with economic
analysis of a single farm output under the as- sumption that both pollination
and pest control are essential inputs. We show that the drive to increase farm
output can lead to a local decline in the wild bee population. Commercial bees
are often considered an alternative to wild pollinators, but we show that their
intro- duction can lead to further decline and finally local extinction of wild
bees. The transitions between different outcomes are characterised by threshold
behaviour and are potentially difficult to predict and detect in advance. Small
changes in economic parameters (input prices) and ecological parameters (wild
bees carrying capacity and effect of pesticides on bees) can move the
economic-ecological system beyond the extinction threshold. We also show that
increasing the pesticide price or decreasing the commercial bee price might
lead to re-establishment of wild bees following their local extinction. Thus,
we demonstrate the importance of combining ecological modelling with economics
to study the provision of ecosystem services and to inform sustainable
management of ecosystem service providers.

observations of the $\gamma$-ray and radio-loud Narrow Line Seyfert galaxy
($\gamma$-NLS1) PKS 2004-447. The active galaxy is a member of a small sample
of radio-loud NLS1s detected in $\gamma$-rays by the Fermi Large Area
Telescope. It is the radio-loudest and only southern-hemisphere source in this
sample. We present results from our X-ray monitoring program comprised of Swift
snapshot observations from 2012 through 2014 and two new X-ray observations
with XMM-Newton in 2012. We analyze the X-ray spectrum and variability of this
peculiar source using supplementary archival data from 2004 and 2011. The
(0.5-10) keV spectrum is well described by a flat power law, which can be
interpreted as non-thermal emission from a relativistic jet. The source
exhibits moderate flux variability on timescales of both months and years.
Correlated brightness variations in the (0.5-2) keV and (2-10) keV bands are
explained by a single variable spectral component, such as the jet. A possible
soft excess seen in the data from 2004 cannot be confirmed by the new \xmm{}
observations in 2012. Any contribution to the total flux in 2004 is less than
$20\%$ of the power-law component. The (0.5-10) keV luminosities of PKS
2004-447 are in the range of (0.5--2.7)$\times10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}$. A
comparison of the X-ray properties among the known $\gamma$-NLS1 galaxies shows
that X-ray spectrum is typically dominated by a flat power law without
intrinsic absorption. These objects are moderately variable in their
brightness, while spectral variability is observed in at least two sources. The
major difference across the X-ray spectra of $\gamma$-NLS1s is the luminosity,
which spans a range of almost two orders of magnitude, from
$10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ to $10^{46}\,\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ in the
(0.5-10) keV band.

emission. The disk shows strong azimuthal asymmetry in the dust continuum
emission, while gas emission is more symmetric. In this paper, we investigate
how gas and dust are distributed in the dust-bright northern part of the disk
and in the dust-faint southern part. We construct two axisymmetric disk models.
One reproduces the radial profiles of the continuum and the velocity moments 0
and 1 of CO lines in the north and the other reproduces those in the south. We
have found that the dust is concentrated in a narrow ring having ~50AU width
(in FWHM; w_d=30AU in our parameter definition) located at ~170-200AU from the
central star. The dust particles are strongly concentrated in the north. We
have found that the dust surface density contrast between the north and south
amounts to ~70. Compared to the dust, the gas distribution is more extended in
the radial direction. We find that the gas component extends at least from
~100AU to ~250AU from the central star, and there should also be tenuous gas
remaining inside and outside of these radii. The azimuthal asymmetry of gas
distribution is much smaller than dust. The gas surface density differs only by
a factor of ~3-10 between the north and south. Hence, gas-to-dust ratio
strongly depends on the location of the disk: ~30 at the location of the peak
of dust distribution in the south and ~3 at the location of the peak of dust
distribution in the north. Despite large uncertainties, the overall gas-to-dust
ratio is inferred to be ~10-30, indicating that the gas depletion may have
already been under way.

row should be left open, open-page policy, or closed immediately, close-page
policy, after the row has been accessed. The appropriate choice for a
particular access can reduce the average memory latency. However, since
application access patterns change at run time, static page policies cannot
guarantee to deliver optimum execution time. Hybrid page policies have been
investigated as a means of covering these dynamic scenarios and are now
implemented in state-of-the-art processors. Hybrid page policies switch between
open-page and close-page policies while the application is running, by
monitoring the access pattern of row hits/conflicts and predicting future
behavior. Unfortunately, as the size of DRAM memory increases, fine-grain
tracking and analysis of memory access patterns does not remain practical. We
propose a compact memory address-based encoding technique which can improve or
maintain the performance of DRAMs page closure predictors while reducing the

a traditional Hybrid page policy. We evaluate them across 70 memory intensive

core-cladding guidance to cladding-air guidance. We resolve the interference

and a land planet that has a small amount of water. Land planets keep liquid
water under larger solar radiation compared to aqua planets. Water loss may
change an aqua planet into a land planet, and the planet can remain habitable
for a longer time than had it stayed an aqua planet. We calculate planetary
evolution with hydrogen escape for different initial water inventories and
different distances from the central star. We find that there are two
conditions to evolve an aqua planet into a land planet: the critical amount of
water on the surface M_ml consistent with a planet being a land planet, and the
critical amount of water vapor in the atmosphere M_cv that defines the onset of
the runaway greenhouse state. We find that Earth-size aqua planets with initial
oceans < 10 % of the Earth's can evolve into land planets if M_cv = 3 m in
precipitable water and M_ml = 5 % of the Earth's ocean mass. Such planets can
keep liquid water on their surface for another 2 Gyrs. The initial amount of
water and M_cv are shown to be important dividing parameters of the planetary
evolution path. Our results indicate that massive hydrogen escape could give a
fresh start as another kind of habitable planet rather than the end of its
habitability.

between -48.0 km sec$^{-1}$ and -40.0 km sec$^{-1}$. The gas distribution
reveals a shell-like molecular structure of $\sim$0.8 pc in radius bordering
the bubble. A cold dust counterpart of the shell is detected in the LABOCA and
Herschel images.The presence of extended emission at 24 $\mu$m and radio
continuum emission inside the bubble indicates that the bubble is a compact HII
region. Part of the molecular gas bordering S24 coincides with the extended
infrared dust cloud SDC341.194-0.221. A cold molecular clump is present at the
interface between S24 and G341.217-0.237. As regards G341.220-0.213, the

the molecular gas. Several YSO candidates are found to be linked to the IR
extended sources, thus confirming their nature as active star-forming regions.
The total gas mass in the region and the H$_2$ ambient density amount to 10300

the existence of invisible forces that drive economic markets. These market
forces interact in complex ways making it difficult to visualize or understand
the interactions in every detail. Here I show how these forces can transcend a
zero-sum game and become a win-win business interaction, thanks to emergent
social synergies triggered by division of labor. Computer simulations with the
model Sociodynamica show here the detailed dynamics underlying this phenomenon
in a simple virtual economy. In these simulations, independent agents act in an
economy exploiting and trading two different goods in a heterogeneous
environment. All and each of the various forces and individuals were tracked
continuously, allowing to unveil a synergistic effect on economic output
produced by the division of labor between agents. Running simulations in a
homogeneous environment, for example, eliminated all benefits of division of
labor. The simulations showed that the synergies unleashed by division of labor
arise if: Economies work in a heterogeneous environment; agents engage in
complementary activities whose optimization processes diverge; agents have
means to synchronize their activities. This insight, although trivial if viewed
a posteriori, improve our understanding of the source and nature of synergies
in real economic markets and might render economic and natural sciences more
consilient.

rank countries: one gold medal is more precious than any number of silver
medals and one silver medal is more precious than any number of bronze medals.
How can we quantify what do these words, more precious, mean? Can we introduce
a counter that for any possible number of medals would allow us to compute a
numerical rank of a country using the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals
in such a way that the higher resulting number would put the country in the
higher position in the rank? Here we show that it is impossible to solve this

demonstrate that this problem can be easily solved by applying numerical
computations with recently developed actual infinite numbers. These

described. It is interesting because it has an infinite perimeter in the limit
but its limit area is finite. In this paper, a recently proposed computational
methodology allowing one to execute numerical computations with infinities and
infinitesimals is applied to study the Koch snowflake at infinity. Numerical
computations with actual infinite and infinitesimal numbers can be executed on
the Infinity Computer being a new supercomputer patented in USA and EU. It is
revealed in the paper that at infinity the snowflake is not unique, i.e.,
different snowflakes can be distinguished for different infinite numbers of
steps executed during the process of their generation. It is then shown that
for any given infinite number~$n$ of steps it becomes possible to calculate the
exact infinite number, $N_n$, of sides of the snowflake, the exact
infinitesimal length, $L_n$, of each side and the exact infinite perimeter,
$P_n$, of the Koch snowflake as the result of multiplication of the infinite
$N_n$ by the infinitesimal $L_n$. It is established that for different infinite
$n$ and $k$ the infinite perimeters $P_n$ and $P_k$ are also different and the
difference can be infinite. It is shown that the finite areas $A_n$ and $A_k$

different infinite $n$ and $k$ and the difference $A_n - A_k$ results to be
infinitesimal. Finally, snowflakes constructed starting from different initial

Newton in the Principia asserted an absolute universal time that {\it `flows
equably'}. Hamilton then proposed a mathematical unification of space and time
within the framework of the quaternions that ultimately lead to the famous
Minkowski formulation in 1908 using four-vectors. The Minkowski framework is
found to provide a versatile formalism for describing the relationship between
space and time in accordance with relativistic principles, but nevertheless
fails to provide deeper insights into the physical origin of time and its
properties. In this paper we begin with a recognition of the fundamental role
played by three-dimensional space in physics that we model using the Clifford
algebra multivector. From this geometrical foundation we are then able to
identify a plausible origin for our concept of time. This geometrical
perspective also allows us to make a key topological distinction between time

generalized unification of time and space within a Minkowski-like description.

parametrized by a modified generalized Chaplygin gas (mGCG) on top of cold dark
matter (CDM). We also take into account the radiation content of the Universe.
In this context, the late stage of the evolution of the universe refers to the
epoch where CDM is already clustered into inhomogeneously distributed discrete
structures (galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies). Under these conditions,
the mechanical approach is an adequate tool to study the Universe deep inside
the cell of uniformity. To be more accurate, we study scalar perturbations of
the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric due to inhomogeneities of CDM
as well as fluctuations of radiation and mGCG, the later driving the late-time
acceleration of the universe. Our analysis applies as well to the case where
mGCG plays the role of DM and DE. We select the sets of parameters of the mGCG
that are compatible with the mechanical approach. These sets define prospective
mGCG models. By comparing the selected sets of models with some of the latest
observational data results, we conclude that the mGCG is in tight agreement
with those observations particularly for a mGCG playing the role of DE and DM.

formulation, which corresponds to the Euler-Lagrange equations up to an
infinite PN order, can be identical to a PN Hamiltonian formulation at the
infinite order from a theoretical point of view. This result is difficult to
check because in most cases one does not know what both the Euler-Lagrange
equations and the equivalent Hamiltonian are at the infinite order. However, no
difficulty exists for a special 1PN Lagrangian formulation of relativistic
circular restricted three-body problem, where both the Euler-Lagrange equations
and the equivalent Hamiltonian not only are expanded to all PN orders but also
have converged functions. Consequently, the analytical evidence supports this
claim. As far as numerical evidences are concerned, the Hamiltonian equivalent
to the Euler-Lagrange equations for the lower order Lagrangian requires that
they both be only at higher enough finite orders.

  Stone-Wales defects","8 Pages, 9 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stone-Wales (SW) defects are favorably existed in graphenelike materials with
honeycomb lattice structure and potentially employed to change the electronic
properties in band engineering. In this paper, we investigate structural and
electronic properties of SW defects in bulk silicene and its nanoribbons as a
function of their concentration using the methods of periodic boundary
conditions with first-principles calculations. We first calculate the formation
energy, structural properties, and electronic band structures of SW defects in
bulk silicene, with dependence on the concentration of SW defects. Our results
show a good agreement with available values from the previous first-principles
calculations. The energetics, structural aspects, and electronic properties of
SW defects with dependence on defect concentration and location in
edge-hydrogenated zigzag silicene nanoribbons are obtained. For all calculated
concentrations, the SW defects prefer to locate at the edge due to the lower
formation energy. The SW defects at the center of silicene nanoribbons slightly
influence on the electronic properties, whereas the SW defects at the edge of
silicene nanoribbons split the degenerate edge states and induce a sizable gap,
which depends on the concentration of defects. It is worth to find that the SW
defects produce a perturbation repulsive potential, which leads the decomposed
charge of edge states at the side with defect to transfer to the other side
without defect.
