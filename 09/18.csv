  July- 6 August, 2015, The Hague, The Netherlands, 17 pages, 8 figures",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Fermi-LAT data revealed giant bubbles of emission above and below the
Galactic plane with an energy spectrum significantly harder than seen from
other directions. How the bubbles connect to the Galactic plane is unclear. We
find that bubble-like emission is not only found in the halo, but it is
strongly present in the Galactic plane as well with a morphology close to the
spatial distribution of the 1.8 MeV gamma-ray line from 26Al, a radioactive
nucleus synthesized in SNRs. In addition, the spectral shape of this hard
component coincides with the predicted spectrum from cosmic rays trapped in
sources. Hence, we propose that the bubble-like emission in the plane has a
hadronic origin, which arises from SCRs. The bubbles in the halo have the same
energy spectrum, which suggests that they are outflows from the plane with the
gamma-rays arising from hadronic interactions of protons trapped in a plasma of
advected gas. Towards the Galactic center (GC) we observe the 1-3 GeV excess,
but observe this excess in addition in all regions where there is strong 26Al
production. This excludes the dark matter annihilation interpretation. Instead,
we propose that the excess is caused by a deficit of the CRs at low rigidities
in the regions of dense molecular clouds, which are characterized by higher
energy losses and stronger stellar winds. The 26Al line is a tracer of such
regions. If we introduce a break in the cosmic ray injection spectra in the
regions of strong 26Al production to effectively take the deficit of low
rigidity CRs into account, the excess in the Galactic plane and towards the GC
both disappear. We thus conclude that the excess in the Galactic center is
largely an artefact from the excess in the Galactic plane. The correlation
between the two originates simply from the lines-of-sight towards the GC
crossing the Galactic plane.

construction of a suitable non-interacting effective medium, we provide an
explicit and numerically practicable scheme to construct the Lehmann
representation for the self-energy, given the Lehmann representation of the
single-particle non-equilibrium Green's function. This is of particular
importance for an efficient numerical solution of Dyson's equation in the
context of approximations where the self-energy is obtained from a reference
system with a small Hilbert space. As compared to conventional techniques to
solve Dyson's equation on the Keldysh contour, the effective-medium approach
allows to reach a maximum propagation time which can be several orders of
magnitude longer. This is demonstrated explicitly by choosing the
non-equilibrium cluster-perturbation theory as a simple approach to study the
long-time dynamics of an inhomogeneous initial state after a quantum quench in
the Hubbard model on a 10 x 10 square lattice. We demonstrate that the
violation of conservation laws is moderate for weak Hubbard interaction and
that the cluster approach is able to describe prethermalization physics.

the X-rays peaking along the north-western side of the bridge in the region

of gas stripped from the galaxies into the bridge and its very long gas
depletion timescale (>10 Gyr) may explain why this system, unlike most major

information about model parameters from data is presented. The algorithm
propagates an ensemble of particles in the product space of model parameters
and outputs. Each particle update consists of a random jump in parameter space
followed by a simulation of a model output and a Metropolis
acceptance/rejection step based on a comparison of the simulated output to the
data. The distance of a particle to the data is interpreted as an energy and
the algorithm is reducing the associated temperature of the ensemble such that
entropy production is minimized. If this simulated annealing is not too fast
compared to the mixing speed in parameter space, the parameter marginal of the
ensemble approaches the Bayesian posterior distribution. Annealing is adaptive
and depends on certain extensive thermodynamic quantities that can easily be
measured throughout run-time. In the general case, we propose annealing with a
constant entropy production rate, which is optimal as long as annealing is not
too fast. For the practically relevant special case of no prior knowledge, we
derive an optimal fast annealing schedule with a non-constant entropy
production rate. The algorithm does not require the calculation of the density
of the model likelihood, which makes it interesting for Bayesian parameter
inference with stochastic models, whose likelihood functions are typically very
high dimensional integrals.

attention to symmetric additively-separable hedonic games, which are a
nontrivial subclass of such games that are guaranteed to possess stable
outcomes. These games are specified by an undirected edge- weighted graph:
nodes are players, an outcome of the game is a partition of the nodes into
coalitions, and the utility of a node is the sum of incident edge weights in
the same coalition. We consider several stability requirements defined in the
literature. These are based on restricting feasible player deviations, for
example, by giving existing coalition members veto power. We extend these
restrictions by considering more general forms of preference aggregation for
coalition members. In particular, we consider voting schemes to decide if
coalition members will allow a player to enter or leave their coalition. For
all of the stability requirements we consider, the existence of a stable
outcome is guaranteed by a potential function argument, and local improvements
will converge to a stable outcome. We provide an almost complete
characterization of these games in terms of the tractability of computing such
stable outcomes. Our findings comprise positive results in the form of
polynomial-time algorithms, and negative (PLS-completeness) results. The
negative results extend to more general hedonic games.

fine-tuning thanks to a cancellation mechanism. The singlet-doublet mixing is
suppressed by $\tan\beta$. In this paper, we further extend this analysis. We
argue that approximate scale symmetries play a role behind the suppression of
the singlet-doublet mixing. They reduce the mixing matrix to a simple form that
is useful to understand the results of the numerical analysis. We perform a
comprehensive analysis of the fine-tuning including the singlet sector by
introducing a simple formula for the fine-tuning measure. This shows that the

moderate $\tan\beta$. We also discuss prospects for the precision measurements

the old stellar population; at this wavelength the effects of dust are also
minimal. The measured features are the sizes, ellipticities, and orientations
of bars, rings, ringlenses, and lenses. Measured in a similar manner are also
barlenses (lens-like structures embedded in the bars), which are not lenses in
the usual sense, being rather the more face-on counterparts of the boxy/peanut
structures in the edge-on view. In addition, pitch angles of spiral arm
segments are measured for those galaxies where they can be reliably traced.
More than one pitch angle may appear for a single galaxy. All measurements are
made in a human-supervised manner so that attention is paid to each galaxy. We
used isophotal analysis, unsharp masking, and fitting ellipses to measured
structures. We find that the sizes of the inner rings and lenses normalized to
barlength correlate with the galaxy mass: the normalized sizes increase toward
the less massive galaxies; it has been suggested that this is related to the
larger dark matter content in the bar region in these systems. Bars in the low
mass galaxies are also less concentrated, likely to be connected to the mass
cut-off in the appearance of the nuclear rings and lenses. We also show
observational evidence that barlenses indeed form part of the bar, and that a
large fraction of the inner lenses in the non-barred galaxies could be former
barlenses in which the thin outer bar component has dissolved.

2.9% for a convolutional networks and 2.0% for convolutional networks with SPN
layers. The SPN outputs a zoomed, rotated and skewed version of the input
image. We investigate different down-sampling factors (ratio of pixel in input
and output) for the SPN and show that the RNN-SPN model is able to down-sample
the input images without deteriorating performance. The down-sampling in
RNN-SPN can be thought of as adaptive down-sampling that minimizes the
information loss in the regions of interest. We attribute the superior
performance of the RNN-SPN to the fact that it can attend to a sequence of
regions of interest.

a promising, nonparametric approach to forecasting that makes no assumptions on

demonstrate that the mean-field significantly underestimates the residence time

temporal correlations are particularly long-lived near the average shock

The observed stars belong to the substructures of the Galaxy thick and thin
discs, and to the Hercules stream. The observations were conducted using the
1.93 m telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP, France) equipped with
the echelle type spectrographs ELODIE and SOPHIE. The abundances were derived
under the LTE approximation, with an average error for the [Mn/Fe] ratio of
0.10 dex. For most of the stars in the sample Mn abundances are not available
in the literature. We obtain an evolution of [Mn/Fe] ratio with the metallicity
[Fe/H] consistent with previous data compilations. In particular, within the
metallicity range covered by our stellar sample the [Mn/Fe] ratio is increasing
with the increase of metallicity. This due to the contribution to the Galactic
chemical evolution of Mn and Fe from thermonuclear supernovae. We confirm the
baseline scenario where most of the Mn in the Galactic disc and in the Sun is
made by thermonuclear supernovae. In particular, the effective contribution
from core-collapse supernovae to the Mn in the Solar system is about 10-20%.
However, present uncertainties affecting the production of Mn and Fe in
thermonuclear supernovae are limiting the constraining power of the observed
[Mn/Fe] trend in the Galactic discs on, e.g., the frequency of different
thermonuclear supernovae populations. The different production of these two
elements in different types of thermonuclear supernovae needs to be
disentangled by the dependence of their relative production on the metallicity
of the supernova progenitor.

found to be highly uniform, but a minority of stars exhibit dramatic
enhancements in their abundances of heavy neutron-capture elements and/or of
carbon. The key question for Galactic chemical evolution models is whether
these peculiarities reflect the composition of the natal clouds, or if they are
due to later mass transfer of processed material from a binary companion. If
the former case applies, the observed excess of certain elements was implanted
within selected clouds in the early ISM from a production site at interstellar
distances. Our aim is to determine the frequency and orbital properties of
binaries among these chemically peculiar stars. This information provides the
basis for deciding whether mass transfer from a binary companion is necessary
and sufficient to explain their unusual compositions. This paper discusses our
study of a sample of 17 moderately (r-I) and highly (r-II) r-process-element
enhanced VMP and EMP stars. High-resolution, low signal-to-noise spectra of the
stars were obtained at roughly monthly intervals over 8 years with the FIES
spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope. From these spectra, radial
velocities with an accuracy of ~100 m/s were determined by cross-correlation
against an optimized template. 14 of the programme stars exhibit no significant
RV variation over this period, while 3 are binaries with orbits of typical
eccentricity for their periods, resulting in a normal binary frequency of
~18+-6% for the sample. Our results confirm our preliminary conclusion from
2011, based on partial data, that the chemical peculiarity of the r-I and r-II
stars is not caused by any putative binary companions. Instead, it was
imprinted on the natal molecular clouds of these stars by an external, distant
source. Models of the ISM in early galaxies should account for such mechanisms.

processes acting in the stellar and circumstellar environment, within a few
stellar radii from the star. NGC 2264 was the target of a multiwavelength
observational campaign with CoRoT, MOST, Spitzer, and Chandra satellites and
observations from the ground. We classified the CoRoT light curves of accreting
systems according to their morphology and compared our classification to
several accretion diagnostics and disk parameters. The morphology of the CoRoT
light curve reflects the evolution of the accretion process and of the inner
disk region. Accretion burst stars present high mass-accretion rates and
optically thick inner disks. AA Tau-like systems, whose light curves are
dominated by circumstellar dust obscuration, show intermediate mass-accretion
rates and are located in the transition of thick to anemic disks. Classical T
Tauri stars with spot-like light curves correspond mostly to systems with a low
mass-accretion rate and low mid-IR excess. About 30% of the classical T Tauri
stars observed in the 2008 and 2011 CoRoT runs changed their light-curve
morphology. Transitions from AA Tau-like and spot-like to aperiodic light
curves and vice versa were common. The analysis of the $H\alpha$ emission line
variability of 58 accreting stars showed that 8 presented a periodicity that in
a few cases was coincident with the photometric period. The blue and red wings
of the $H\alpha$ line profiles often do not correlate with each other,
indicating that they are strongly influenced by different physical processes.
Accreting stars have a dynamic stellar and circumstellar environment that can
be explained by magnetospheric accretion and outflow models, including
variations from stable to unstable accretion regimes on timescales of a few
years

the ultra-relativistic limit. If considered with respect to $G$, the theory has
no this problem. But the metric now depends on spin, so there is no unique
space-time manifold for the Universe of spinning particles: each particle
probes his own three-dimensional geometry. This can be improved by adding a
non-minimal interaction of spin with gravity through gravimagnetic moment. The
modified MPTD equations with unit gravimagnetic moment have reasonable behavior

around this problem is to use the recolliding electron to directly initiate the

the role of the M2 phase, which is unable to activate propane but was suggested
in some studies to function in synergy with the M1 phase by efficiently
converting the propylene intermediate to acrylonitrile. The present study
systematically examined the catalytic behavior of pure M1 phases prepared by
selective dissolution of the M2 phase in MoV(Te,Sb)(Nb,Ta)O catalysts in
aqueous hydrogen peroxide. It confirmed that the MoV(Te,Sb)(Nb,Ta)O M1 phases
are highly active and selective for propane and propylene ammoxidation, while
the MoV(Te,Sb)(Nb,Ta)O M2 phases were active and selective in propylene
ammoxidation only. Most importantly, the kinetic study of the
MoV(Te,Sb)(Nb,Ta)O M1 and M2 phases in propylene ammoxidation revealed for the
very first time that that the M2 phases are significantly less active than the
M1 phase in propylene ammoxidation. The findings of this study do not support
the existence of the synergy effect for any M1/M2 compositional variant.
Instead, the observed behavior of MoV(Te,Sb)(Nb,Ta)O catalysts was consistent
with partial loss of some surface active species from the M1 phase surface
during the H2O2 treatment and generation of fresh ab planes of the M1 phase via
mechanical grinding of the H2O2-treated M1 phase. These findings provided
further evidence that the M1 phase is the only phase required for the activity

vision: Human interaction recognition in still images. We explore whether the
facial regions and their spatial configurations contribute to the recognition
of interactions. In this respect, our method involves extraction of several
visual features from the facial regions, as well as incorporation of scene
characteristics and deep features to the recognition. Extracted multiple
features are utilized within a discriminative learning framework for
recognizing interactions between people. Our designed facial descriptors are
based on the observation that relative positions, size and locations of the
faces are likely to be important for characterizing human interactions. Since
there is no available dataset in this relatively new domain, a comprehensive
new dataset which includes several images of human interactions is collected.
Our experimental results show that faces and scene characteristics contain
important information to recognize interactions between people.

estimated to be orders of magnitude more energy-efficient than current

this paper aims to further generalize the two aforementioned results by

present an important test of the standard cosmological model, as the standard
model predicts the galaxy measurement should precisely agree with the existing
precise measurements made using the CMB. However, the required statistical
precision to measure the kinematic dipole typically makes the measurement
susceptible to bias from the presence of the local-structure-induced dipole
contamination. In order to minimize the latter, a sufficiently deep survey is
required. We forecast both the statistical error and the systematic bias in the
kinematic dipole measurements. We find that a survey covering $\sim 75\%$ of
the sky in both hemispheres and having $\sim 30$ million galaxies can detect
the kinematic dipole at $5\sigma$, while its median redshift should be at least
$z_{med} \sim 0.75$ for negligible bias from the local structure.

cases we also constrain the slope of the size-wavelength relation. Our size
constraints of the soft and hard X-ray emission regions of quasars indicate
that in some objects of our sample the hard X-ray emission region is more
compact than the soft and in others the soft emission region is smaller. This
difference may be the result of the relative strengths of the disk-reflected

Recently, the functional programming community has shown renewed interest in
UnCAL, because it provides an efficient graph transformation language which is
useful for various applications, such as bidirectional computation. However, no

we give an equational axiomatisation and algebraic semantics of UnCAL graphs.
The main result of this paper is to prove that completeness of our equational

algebras. Another benefit of algebraic semantics is a clean characterisation of
structural recursion on graphs using free iteration algebra.

nuclear-modification factor $R_{AA}$ are presented and compared with those from

of the invariant yields from U$+$U and Au$+$Au collisions within the same

coalescence. Two different parameterizations of the deformed Woods-Saxon
distribution were used in Glauber calculations to determine the values of the
number of nucleon-nucleon collisions in each centrality class, $N_{\rm coll}$,
and these were found to give significantly different $N_{\rm coll}$ values.
Results using $N_{\rm coll}$ values from both deformed Woods-Saxon
distributions are presented. The measured ratios show that the $J/\psi$
suppression, relative to binary collision scaling, is similar in U$+$U and
Au$+$Au for peripheral and midcentral collisions, but that $J/\psi$ show less
suppression for the most central U$+$U collisions. The results are consistent
with a picture in which, for central collisions, increase in the $J/\psi$ yield
due to $c\bar{c}$ coalescence becomes more important than the decrease in yield
due to increased energy density. For midcentral collisions, the conclusions
about the balance between $c\bar{c}$ coalescence and suppression depend on
which deformed Woods-Saxon distribution is used to determine $N_{\rm coll}$.

construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect

manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability
is advantageous, and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel.
High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to

problem with fixed data flows and optimize energy management at each node for
the case of a single energy harvest per node. This is tantamount to
distributing each node's available energy over its outgoing data links and
energy transfers to neighboring nodes. For this case, with no energy
cooperation, we show that each node should allocate more power to links with
more noise and/or more data flow. In addition, when there is energy
cooperation, our numerical results indicate that, energy is routed from nodes
with lower data loads to nodes with higher data loads. We extend this setting
to the case of multiple energy harvests per node over time. In this case, we
optimize each node's energy management over its outgoing data links and its
energy transfers to neighboring nodes, over multiple time slots. For this case,
with no energy cooperation, we show that, for any given node, the sum of powers
on the outgoing links is equal to the single-link optimal power over time.
Finally, we consider the problem of joint flow control and energy management
for the entire network. We determine the necessary conditions for joint
optimality of a power control, energy transfer and routing policy. We provide

dispersal of the gaseous protoplanetary disk have been widely successful in
reconstructing the current orbital configuration of the giant planets.
Statistically, some of the most successful dynamical evolution simulations have
initially included a hypothetical fifth giant planet, of ice giant mass, which
gets ejected by a gas giant during the early solar system's proposed
instability phase. We investigate the likelihood of an ice giant ejection event
by either Jupiter or Saturn through constraints imposed by the current orbits
of their wide-separation regular satellites Callisto and Iapetus respectively.
We show that planetary encounters that are sufficient to eject an ice giant,
often provide excessive perturbations to the orbits of Callisto and Iapetus
making it difficult to reconcile a planet ejection event with the current orbit
of either satellite. Quantitatively, we compute the likelihood of reconciling a
regular Jovian satellite orbit with the current orbit of Callisto following an
ice giant ejection by Jupiter of ~ 42% and conclude that such a large
likelihood supports the hypothesis of a fifth giant planet's existence. A
similar calculation for Iapetus reveals that it is much more difficult for
Saturn to have ejected an ice giant and reconcile a Kronian satellite orbit
with that of Iapetus (likelihood ~ 1%), although uncertainties regarding the
formation of Iapetus, on its unusual orbit, complicates the interpretation of
this result.

atmosphere of white dwarf stars. We demonstrate that convective energy transfer
is seriously impeded by magnetic fields when the plasma-beta parameter, the
thermal to magnetic pressure ratio, becomes smaller than unity. The critical
field strength that inhibits convection in the photosphere of white dwarfs is
in the range B = 1-50 kG, which is much smaller than the typical 1-1000 MG
field strengths observed in magnetic white dwarfs, implying that these objects
have radiative atmospheres. We have then employed evolutionary models to study
the cooling process of high-field magnetic white dwarfs, where convection is
entirely suppressed during the full evolution (B > 10 MG). We find that the
inhibition of convection has no effect on cooling rates until the effective
temperature (Teff) reaches a value of around 5500 K. In this regime, the
standard convective sequences start to deviate from the ones without convection
owing to the convective coupling between the outer layers and the degenerate
reservoir of thermal energy. Since no magnetic white dwarfs are currently known
at the low temperatures where this coupling significantly changes the
evolution, effects of magnetism on cooling rates are not expected to be
observed. This result contrasts with a recent suggestion that magnetic white
dwarfs with Teff < 10,000 K cool significantly slower than non-magnetic
degenerates.

spectral heat flux is achieved at the gap distance of 20 nm. By carefully
selecting the graphene chemical potential and doping levels of silicon nanohole
emitter and silicon plate receiver, the total near-field radiative heat flux
can reach about 500 times higher than the far-field blackbody limit between 400
K and 300 K. The physical mechanisms are elucidated by the near-field surface
plasmon coupling with fluctuational electrodynamics and dispersion relations.
The effects of graphene chemical potential, emitter and receiver doping levels,
and vacuum gap distance on the near-field coupling and radiative transfer are
analyzed in detail.

points called Weyl nodes. These nodes come in pairs with opposite chiralities.
We show that the coupling of circularly polarized photons with these chiral
electrons generates a Hall conductivity without any applied magnetic field in
the plane orthogonal to the light propagation. This phenomenon comes about
because with all three Pauli matrices exhausted to form the three-dimensional
linear dispersion, the Weyl nodes cannot be gapped. Rather, the net influence
of chiral photons is to shift the positions of the Weyl nodes. Interestingly,
the momentum shift is tightly correlated with the chirality of the node to
produce a net anomalous Hall signal. Application of our proposal to the

order-of-magnitude estimate of the photoinduced Hall conductivity which is
within the experimentally accessible range.

however, have undergone less than a full rotation since the time of the
interaction/merger event, raising the question of whether they are in dynamical
equilibrium. Assuming that these discs are in equilibrium, the inferred
dynamical masses are consistent with the observed baryonic masses, implying
that TDGs are devoid of dark matter. This puts constraints on putative ""dark

TDGs seem to systematically deviate from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation.

center allows interlopers to contaminate the clusters. In the standard
approach, we use a power-law scaling relation to infer cluster mass from galaxy
line-of-sight (LOS) velocity dispersion. Assuming perfect membership knowledge,
this unrealistic case produces a wide fractional mass error distribution, with
a width of $\Delta\epsilon\approx0.87$. Interlopers introduce additional
scatter, significantly widening the error distribution further
($\Delta\epsilon\approx2.13$). We employ the support distribution machine (SDM)
class of algorithms to learn from distributions of data to predict single
values. Applied to distributions of galaxy observables such as LOS velocity and
projected distance from the cluster center, SDM yields better than a
factor-of-two improvement ($\Delta\epsilon\approx0.67$) for the contaminated

recover masses than even the scaling relation approach applied to
uncontaminated clusters. We show that the SDM method more accurately reproduces

processes, we carried out Br-gamma spectro-interferometry using AMBER/VLTI from
three different baselines achieving spatial and spectral resolutions of 2-4 mas
and 12000. The Br-gamma visibility is larger than that of the continuum for all
baselines. Differential phases reveal a shift between the photocentre of the
Br-gamma line -displaced 0.6 mas (0.06 au at 100 pc) NE from the star- and that
of the K-band continuum emission -displaced 0.3 mas NE from the star. The
photocentres of the redshifted and blueshifted components of the Br-gamma line
are located NW and SE from the photocentre of the peak line emission,
respectively. Moreover, the photocentre of the fastest velocity bins within the
spectral line tends to be closer to that of the peak emission than the
photocentre of the slowest velocity bins. Our results are consistent with a
Br-gamma emitting region inside the dust inner rim (<0.25 au) and extending
very close to the central star, with a Keplerian, disc-like structure rotating
counter-clockwise, and most probably flared (25 deg). Even though the main
contribution to the Br-gamma line does not come from gas magnetically
channelled on to the star, accretion on to HD 100546 could be magnetospheric,
implying a mass accretion rate of a few 10^-7 Msun/yr. This value indicates
that the observed gas has to be replenished on time-scales of a few months to
years, perhaps by planet-induced flows from the outer to the inner disc as has
been reported for similar systems.

luminous (L2-10keV~4x10^{44} erg/s) quasar (named PID352) at z~1.6 (derived
from the X-ray spectral analysis) in the Chandra Deep Field-South. The source
is characterized by an iron emission and absorption line complex at observed
energies of E~2-3 keV. While the emission line is interpreted as being due to
neutral iron (consistent with the presence of cold absorption), the absorption
feature is due to highly ionized iron transitions (FeXXV, FeXXVI) with an
outflowing velocity of 0.14^{+0.02}_{-0.06}c, as derived from photoionization
models. The mass outflow rate - ~2 Msun/yr - is similar to the source accretion
rate, and the derived mechanical energy rate is ~9.5x10^{44} erg/s,
corresponding to 9% of the source bolometric luminosity. PID352 represents one
of the few cases where indications of X-ray outflowing gas have been observed
at high redshift thus far. This wind is powerful enough to provide feedback on
the host galaxy.

laboratory for the direct production of heavy lepton partners in Seesaw models.
In the context of the Type III Seesaw Mechanism, the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$
rate and shape corrections are presented for the pair production of
hypothetical, heavy $SU(2)_L$ triplet leptons in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$
13, 14, and 100 TeV. The next-to-leading order (NLO) $K$-factors span,
approximately, $K^{NLO}=1.1 - 1.4$ for both charged current and neutral current
processes over a triplet mass range $m_T = 100~\text{GeV}-2~\text{TeV}$. Total
production cross sections exhibit a $^{+5\%}_{-6\%}$ scale dependence at 14 TeV
and $\pm1\%$ at 100 TeV. The NLO differential $K$-factors for heavy lepton
kinematics are largely flat, suggesting that na\""ive scaling by the total
$K^{NLO}$ is reasonably justified. The resummed transverse momentum
distribution of the dilepton system is presented at leading logarithmic (LL)
accuracy. The effects of resummation are large in TeV-scale dilepton systems.
Discovery potential to heavy lepton pairs at 14 and 100 TeV is briefly
explored: At the High-Luminosity LHC, we estimate a $4.8-6.3\sigma$ discovery
potential maximally for $m_T = 1.5-1.6~\text{TeV}$ after 3000 fb$^{-1}$. With
300 (3000) fb$^{-1}$, there is $2\sigma$ sensitivity up to $m_T =
1.3-1.4~\text{TeV}~(1.7-1.8~\text{TeV})$ in the individual channels. At 100 TeV
and with 10 fb$^{-1}$, a $5\sigma$ discovery can be achieved for
$m_T=1.4-1.6~\text{TeV}$. Due to the factorization properties of Drell-Yan-type
systems, the fixed order and resummed calculations reduce to convolutions over

structure and dynamics of radiation dominated envelopes of massive stars at the
location of the iron opacity peak. One dimensional hydrostatic calculations
predict an unstable density inversion at this location, whereas our simulations
reveal a complex interplay of convective and radiative transport whose behavior
depends on the ratio of the photon diffusion time to the dynamical time. The
latter is set by the ratio of the optical depth per pressure scale height,
$\tau_0$, to $\tau_c=c/c_g$, where $c_g \approx$ 50 km/s is the isothermal
sound speed in the gas alone. When $\tau_0 \gg \tau_c$, convection reduces the
radiation acceleration and removes the density inversion. The turbulent energy
transport in the simulations agrees with mixing length theory and provides its
first numerical calibration in the radiation dominated regime. When $\tau_0 \ll
\tau_c$, convection becomes inefficient and the turbulent energy transport is
negligible. The turbulent velocities exceed $c_g$, driving shocks and large
density fluctuations that allow photons to preferentially diffuse out through
low-density regions. However, the effective radiation acceleration is still
larger than the gravitational acceleration so that the time average density
profile contains a modest density inversion. In addition, the simulated
envelope undergoes large-scale oscillations with periods of a few hours. The
turbulent velocity field may affect the broadening of spectral lines and
therefore stellar rotation measurements in massive stars, while the time
variable outer atmosphere could lead to variations in their mass loss and
stellar radius.

accurately disaggregating energy use at the level of each Air Handler Unit and
each thermal zone within these buildings. HVACMeter power estimations have on

numbers $a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2$ with $a_1b_2-a_2b_1 \neq 0$. In this paper we
establish the logarithmically averaged version $$ \sum_{x/\omega(x) < n \leq x}

Chowla conjecture as $x \to \infty$, where $1 \leq \omega(x) \leq x$ is an
arbitrary function of $x$ that goes to infinity as $x \to \infty$, thus
breaking the ""parity barrier"" for this problem. Our main tools are the
multiplicativity of the Liouville function at small primes, a recent result of
Matom\""aki, Radziwi{\l}{\l}, and the author on the averages of modulated
multiplicative functions in short intervals, concentration of measure
inequalities, the Hardy-Littlewood circle method combined with a restriction
theorem for the primes, and a novel ""entropy decrement argument"". Most of these
ingredients are also available (in principle, at least) for the higher order
correlations, with the main missing ingredient being the need to control short
sums of multiplicative functions modulated by local nilsequences.
  Our arguments also extend to more general bounded multiplicative functions
than the Liouville function $\lambda$, leading to a logarithmically averaged
version of the Elliott conjecture in the two-point case. In a subsequent paper
we will use this version of the Elliott conjecture to affirmatively settle the
Erd\H{o}s discrepancy problem.

and heating the intergalactic medium (IGM). In particular, X-rays are very
efficient at heating the IGM before it became completely ionized, an effect
that can be measured through the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen. High-mass
X-ray binaries (HMXBs), known to be prolific X-ray sources in star-forming
galaxies at lower redshifts, are prime candidates for driving the thermal
evolution of the IGM at redshifts $z > 20$. Despite their importance, the
formation efficiency of HMXBs from the first stellar populations is not well
understood---as such, their collective X-ray emission and the subsequent
imprint on the 21 cm signature are usually evaluated using free parameters.
Using $N$-body simulations, we estimate the rate of HMXB formation via mutual
gravitational interactions of nascent, small groups of the first stars (Pop III
stars). We run two sets of calculations: one in which stars form in small
groups of five in nearly Keplerian initial orbits, and another in which two
such groups collide (expected from mergers of host protogalaxies). We find that
HMXBs form at a rate of one per $~10^{4}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ in newly born stars,
and that they emit with a power of $\sim 10^{41} ~{\rm erg}~{\rm s} ^{-1}$ in
the $2-10$ keV band per solar mass per year of star formation. This value is a
factor $\sim 10^{2}$ larger than what is observed in star forming galaxies at
lower redshifts; the X-ray production from early HMXBs would have been even
more copious, if they also formed $in$ $situ$ or via migration in protostellar
disks. Combining our results with earlier studies suggests that early HMXBs
were highly effective at heating the IGM and leaving a strong 21 cm signature.
We discuss broader implications of our results, such as the rate of long GRBs
from PopIII stars and the direct collapse black hole formation.

direction of the molecular outflow and the equatorial plane of the hot
molecular core at its base, as recently observed on sub-arcsecond scales. We
provide a first detailed picture of the gas dynamics and magnetic field
configuration within a radius of 2000 AU from a massive YSO. We have been able
to reproduce the magnetic field lines for the outer regions (>600 AU) of the
molecular envelope, where the magnetic field orientation shows a smooth change
with the maser cloudlets position (0.2 degree/AU). Overall, the velocity field
vectors well accommodate with the local, magnetic field direction, but still
show an average misalignment of 30 degrees. We interpret this finding as the
contribution of a turbulent velocity field of about 3.5 km/s, responsible for
braking up the alignment between the velocity and magnetic field vectors. We do
resolve different gas flows which develop both along the outflow axis and
across the disk plane, with an average speed of 7 km/s. In the direction of the
outflow axis, we establish a collimation of the gas flow, at a distance of
about 1000 AU from the disk plane. In the disk region, gas appears to stream
outward along the disk plane for radii greater than 500-600 AU, and inward for
shorter radii.

compare this to the total amount of mass accreted by U Sco before the eruption,

Furthermore, measurements of the rate of change of pulsation period offer a

state-of-the-art stellar evolution models assuming different amounts of initial
rotation and convective core overshoot and measure theoretical rates of period

intermediate and old stellar populations to large radius and low effective
surface brightness levels. Akin to other dwarfs with multiple populations of
different ages, stellar populations of decreasing average age are increasingly
concentrated in this galaxy. We find that the young, star-bursting population,

formation occurred significantly away from the center of the galaxy. The RGB
population traces an extended structure that is typical of blue compact
galaxies, with an effective radius of ~5.75 arcmins (~1.25 kpc). These
measurements show that IC10 is much more extended than has previously been
realized, and this blue compact galaxy is one of the most extended dwarf
galaxies in the Local Group. The outermost isophotes of this galaxy are very
regular in shape and essentially circular in morphology. Based on this

many classification methods, Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a
traditional model-based approach which makes use of the covariance information.
However, in the high-dimensional, low-sample size setting, LDA cannot be
directly deployed because the sample covariance is not invertible. While there
are modern methods designed to deal with high-dimensional data, they may not
fully use the covariance information as LDA does. Hence in some situations, it
is still desirable to use a model-based method such as LDA for classification.
This article exploits the potential of LDA in more complicated data settings.
In many real applications, it is costly to manually place labels on
observations; hence it is often that only a small portion of labeled data is
available while a large number of observations are left without a label. It is
a great challenge to obtain good classification performance through the labeled
data alone, especially when the dimension is greater than the size of the
labeled data. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a semi-supervised
sparse LDA classifier to take advantage of the seemingly useless unlabeled
data. They provide additional information which helps to boost the
classification performance in some situations. A direct estimation method is
used to reconstruct LDA and achieve the sparsity; meanwhile we employ the
difference-convex algorithm to handle the non-convex loss function associated
with the unlabeled data. Theoretical properties of the proposed classifier are
studied. Our simulated examples help to understand when and how the information
extracted from the unlabeled data can be useful. A real data example further
illustrates the usefulness of the proposed method.

Complex bipolar shapes can be generated either as a planetary nebula
or a symbiotic system. The origin of the material ionised by the white dwarf is
very different in these two scenarios, and it complicates the understanding of
the morphologies of planetary nebulae. Aims. The physical properties,
structure, and dynamics of the bipolar nebulae, M 2-9, Mz 3, and Hen 2-104, are
investigated in detail with the aim of understanding their nature, shaping
mechanisms, and evolutionary history. Methods. Long-slit optical echelle
spectra are used to investigate the morpho-kinematics of M 2-9, Mz 3, and Hen
2-104. Near-infrared (NIR) data, as well as optical, spectra are used to
separate Galactic symbiotic-type nebulae from genuine planetary nebulae by
means of a 2MASS J-H/H-Ks diagram and a {\lambda}4363/H{\gamma} vs.
{\lambda}5007/H\b{eta} diagnostic diagram, respectively. Results. The
best-fitted 3-D models for M 2-9, Mz 3, and Hen 2-104 provide invaluable
kinematical information on the expansion velocity of its nebular components by
means of synthetic spectra. Kinematical ages of the different structures of M
2-9 and Mz 3 have also been determined. Both diagnostic diagrams show M 2-9 and
Hen 2-104 to fall well within the category of having a symbiotic source,
whereas Mz 3 borders the region of symbiotic and young planetary nebulae in the
optical diagram. The optical diagnostic diagram is shown to successfully
separate the two types of nebulae. Conclusions. The morphology, kinematics, and
evolutionary history of M 2-9, Mz 3, and Hen 2-104 are better understood using
the interactive 3-D modelling tool shape. The optical and NIR diagnostic
diagrams used are important techniques for separating Galactic symbiotic-type
nebulae from genuine planetary nebulae.

modeling matrix-variate data. Since the support of sparse precision matrix
represents the conditional independence graph among matrix entries, conducting
support recovery yields valuable information. A commonly used approach is the
penalized log-likelihood method. However, due to the complicated structure of
precision matrices in the form of Kronecker product, the log-likelihood is
non-convex, which presents challenges for both computation and theoretical
analysis. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach by formulating the
support recovery problem into a multiple testing problem. A new test statistic
is developed and based on that, we use the popular Benjamini and Hochberg's
procedure to control false discovery rate (FDR) asymptotically. Our method
involves only convex optimization, making it computationally attractive.
Theoretically, our method allows very weak conditions, i.e., even when the
sample size is finite and the dimensions go to infinity, the asymptotic
normality of the test statistics and FDR control can still be guaranteed. We
further provide the power analysis result. The finite sample performance of the
proposed method is illustrated by both simulated and real data analysis.

proton (p-p) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). They are key
physics objects for precision measurements and searches for new phenomena. This
review provides an overview of the reconstruction and calibration of jets at
the LHC during its first Run. ATLAS and CMS developed different approaches for
the reconstruction of jets, but use similar methods for the energy calibration.
ATLAS reconstructs jets utilizing input signals from their calorimeters and use
charged particle tracks to refine their energy measurement and suppress the
effects of multiple p-p interactions (pileup). CMS, instead, combines
calorimeter and tracking information to build jets from particle flow objects.
Jets are calibrated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and a residual in situ
calibration derived from collision data is applied to correct for the
differences in jet response between data and Monte Carlo. Large samples of
dijet, Z+jets, and photon+jet events at the LHC allowed the calibration of jets
with high precision, leading to very small systematic uncertainties. Both ATLAS
and CMS achieved a jet energy calibration uncertainty of about 1% in the
central detector region and for jets with transverse momentum pT>100 GeV. At
low jet pT, the jet energy calibration uncertainty is less than 4%, with
dominant contributions from pileup, differences in energy scale between quark
and gluon jets, and jet flavor composition.

identified. In the first regime, at low wind speed, the surface is dominated by
rapidly propagating disorganized wrinkles, elongated in the streamwise
direction, which can be interpreted as the surface response to the pressure
fluctuations advected by the turbulent airflow. The amplitude of these
deformations increases approximately linearly with wind velocity and are
essentially independent of the fetch (distance along the channel). Above a
threshold in wind speed, the perturbations organize themselves spatially into
quasi parallel waves perpendicular to the wind direction with their amplitude
increasing downstream. In this second regime, the wave amplitude increases with
wind speed but far more quickly than in the first regime.

Automorphic loops are loops in which all inner mappings are automorphisms.
  The first paper on automorphic loops appeared in 1956 and there has been a
surge of interest in the topic since 2010. The purpose of these notes is to
introduce the methods used in the study of automorphic loops to a wider
audience of researchers working in nonassociative mathematics.
  In the first lecture we establish basic properties of automorphic loops
(flexibility, power-associativity and the antiautomorphic inverse property) and
discuss relations of automorphic loops to Moufang loops.
  In the second lecture we expand on ideas of Glauberman and investigate the
associated operation $(x^{-1}\backslash (y^2x))^{1/2}$ and similar concepts,
using a more modern approach of twisted subgroups. We establish many structural
results for commutative and general automorphic loops, including the Odd Order
Theorem.
  In the last lecture we look at enumeration and constructions of automorphic
loops. We show that there are no nonassociative simple automorphic loops of
order less than $4096$, we study commutative automorphic loops of order $pq$
and $p^3$, and introduce two general constructions of automorphic loops.
  The material is newly organized and sometimes new, shorter proofs are given.

efficient indexing and search methods recently. In many critical applications
such as large-scale search and pattern matching, finding the nearest neighbors
to a query is a fundamental research problem. However, the straightforward
solution using exhaustive comparison is infeasible due to the prohibitive
computational complexity and memory requirement. In response, Approximate
Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search based on hashing techniques has become popular
due to its promising performance in both efficiency and accuracy. Prior
randomized hashing methods, e.g., Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), explore
data-independent hash functions with random projections or permutations.
Although having elegant theoretic guarantees on the search quality in certain
metric spaces, performance of randomized hashing has been shown insufficient in
many real-world applications. As a remedy, new approaches incorporating
data-driven learning methods in development of advanced hash functions have
emerged. Such learning to hash methods exploit information such as data
distributions or class labels when optimizing the hash codes or functions.
Importantly, the learned hash codes are able to preserve the proximity of
neighboring data in the original feature spaces in the hash code spaces. The
goal of this paper is to provide readers with systematic understanding of
insights, pros and cons of the emerging techniques. We provide a comprehensive
survey of the learning to hash framework and representative techniques of
various types, including unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised. In
addition, we also summarize recent hashing approaches utilizing the deep
learning models. Finally, we discuss the future direction and trends of
research in this area.

$x$ (e.g., some experimental data), find a ""good"" explanation of this data. It
uses algorithmic information theory to define formally what is a good
explanation. In this paper we extend this framework in two directions.
  First, the explanations are not only interesting in themselves but also used
for prediction: we want to know what kind of data we may reasonably expect in
similar situations (repeating the same experiment). We show that some kind of
hierarchy can be constructed both in terms of algorithmic statistics and using
the notion of a priori probability, and these two approaches turn out to be
equivalent.
  Second, a more realistic approach that goes back to machine learning theory,
assumes that we have not a single data string $x$ but some set of ""positive

that we want to learn. We want this set $A$ to contain all positive examples

frequencies of the Sun covering the period from 2001 July to June 2014. These
are obtained through the ring-diagram technique applied to the full-disk
Doppler observations made by the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). The
frequency shifts in the degree range of 180-1200 are correlated with different
proxies of solar activity e.g. 10.7 cm radio flux, the International Sunspot
Number and the strength of the local magnetic field. In general, a good
agreement is found between the shifts and activity indices, and the correlation
coefficients are found to be comparable with intermediate degree mode
frequencies. Analyzing the frequency shifts separately for the two cycles, we
find that cycle 24 is weaker than cycle 23. Since the magnetic activity is
known to be different in the two hemisphere, for the first time, we compute the
frequency shifts over the two hemispheres separately and find that the shifts
also display hemispheric asymmetry; the amplitude of shifts in the northern
hemisphere peaked during late 2011, more than two years earlier than the south.
We further correlate the hemispheric frequency shifts with the hemispheric
sunspot number and mean magnetic activity index. Since the frequency shifts and
the hemispheric activity indices are found to be significantly correlated, we
suggest that the shifts be used as an indicator of hemispheric activity since
not many indices are measured over the two hemispheres separately. We also
investigate the variation at different latitudinal bands and conclude that the
shifts in active latitudes correlate well with the local magnetic activity
index.

noise threshold the bit-error probability of the bit-sampling decoder converges
in mean to zero over the code ensemble and the channel realizations. To arrive
at this result we show that the bit-error probability of the sampling decoder
is equal to the derivative of a Bethe free entropy. The method that we
developed is new and is based on convexity of the free entropy and loop
calculus. Convexity is needed to exchange limit and derivative and the loop
series enables us to express the difference between the bit-error probability
and the Bethe free entropy. We control the loop series using combinatorial
techniques and a first moment method. We stress that our method is versatile

strategies are real vectors with unit 2-norms (or, on a unit-sphere). As a
result, they can no longer be interpreted as probability distributions over
actions, but rather be thought of as allocations of one unit of resource to
actions and the multiplicative payoff effect on each action is proportional to
square-root of the amount of resource allocated to that action. The new
definition generates a number of interesting consequences. We first
characterize sufficient and necessary conditions under which a two-player
unit-sphere game has a Nash equilibrium. The characterization effectively
reduces solving a unit-sphere game to finding all eigenvalues and eigenvectors
of the product of individual payoff matrices. For any unit-sphere game with
non-negative payoff matrices, there always exists a unique Nash equilibrium;
furthermore, the unique equilibrium is efficiently reachable via Cournot
adjustment. In addition, we show that any equilibrium in positive unit-sphere
games corresponds to approximate equilibria in the corresponding normal-form
games. Analogous but weaker results are extended to positive n-player

magnetars are generally over-estimated as compared to their true ages. This
discrepancy is thought to arise because the former are calculated without
considering decay of the magnetic fields. This novel view is supported
independently by much stronger Galactic-plane concentration of magnetars than
other pulsars. The process of magnetic field decay in magnetars is
mathematically modeled. It is implied that magnetars are much younger objects
than previously considered, and can dominate new-born neutron stars.

emerging in an extended Bose-Hubbard model on kagome lattice, where the
non-interacting band structure is topological trivial with zero Berry curvature
in the Brillouin zone. By means of an unbiased state-of-the-art density-matrix
renormalization group technique, we identify that the groundstate in a broad

state, based on the characterization of universal properties including
groundstate degeneracy, edge excitations and anyonic quasiparticle statistics.
Our work paves a way of finding interaction induced topological phase at the

discovered in the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/AIA data. In contrast to
decaying kink oscillations that are excited by impulsive dynamical processes,
this type of transverse oscillations is not connected to any external impulsive
impact, such as a flare or CME, and does not show any significant decay.
Moreover the amplitude of these decayless oscillations is typically lower than
that of decaying oscillations. The aim of this research is to estimate the
prevalence of this phenomenon and its characteristic signatures. We analysed 21
active regions (NOAA 11637--11657) observed in January 2013 in the 171 A
channel of SDO/AIA. For each active region we inspected six hours of
observations, constructing time-distance plots for the slits positioned across
pronounced bright loops. The oscillatory patterns in time-distance plots were
visually identified and the oscillation periods and amplitudes were measured.
We also estimated the length of each oscillating loop. Low-amplitude decayless
kink oscillations are found to be present in the majority of the analysed
active regions. The oscillation periods lie in the range from 1.5 to
10~minutes. In two active regions with insufficient observation conditions we
did not identify any oscillation patterns. The oscillation periods are found to
increase with the length of the oscillating loop. The considered type of
coronal oscillations is a common phenomenon in the corona. The established
dependence of the oscillation period on the loop length is consistent with
their interpretation in terms of standing kink waves.

phononic crystals with low frequency resonances. We demonstrate that in general
these structures need to be described by means of a frequency-dependent and
non-local anisotropic mass density, stiffness tensor and a third- rank coupling
tensor, which shows that they behave like a non-local Willis medium. The effect
of non-locality and coupling tensor manifest themselves for some particular
resonances whereas they become negligible for other resonances. Considering the
example of a two-dimensional phononic crystal, consisting of triangular
arrangements of cylindrical shells in an elastic matrix, we show that its mass
density tensor is strongly resonant and anisotropic presenting both positive
and negative divergent values, while becoming scalar in the quasi-static limit.
Moreover, it is found that the negative value of transverse component of the
mass density is induced by a dipolar resonance, while that of the vertical
component is induced by a monopolar one. Finally, the dispersion relation
obtained by the effective parameters of the crystal is compared with the band
structure, showing a good agreement for the low-wave number region, although
the non-local effects are important given the existence of some resonant values
of the wave number.

therefore determine the domain patterns and polarisation switching properties

charged layers in fully and partially depleted BiFeO$_3$ thin films in the
rhombohedral phase. While the domain pattern in a charge-free BiFeO$_3$ film
consists of only two polarisation variants, we observe complex patterns with
four coexisting variants that form within the charged layers at sufficiently
high induced fields. These variants form a head-to-head configuration with an
interface that is either wavy or planar depending on the internal field
strength, which is determined by the charge density as well as the thickness of
the charged layer. For depletion layers with sufficient thickness, there exists
a range of charge density values for which the interface is wavy, while at high
densities the interface becomes planar. We find that films with wavy interfaces
exhibit enhanced susceptibilities with reduced hystereses compared to the
charge-free film. The results of our work suggest that introducing space charge
regions by careful selection of dopant density and electrode materials can
engineer domain patterns that yield a higher response with a smaller

developed as a general framework for linear mixed variational problems, their

approach in FEEC, pioneered by Arnold, Falk, and Winther in two seminal
articles in 2006 and 2010, interprets these problems in the setting of Hilbert
complexes, leading to a more general and complete understanding. Over the last
five years, the FEEC framework has been extended to a broader set of problems.
One such extension, due to Holst and Stern in 2012, was to problems with
variational crimes, allowing for the analysis and numerical approximation of
linear and geometric elliptic partial differential equations on Riemannian
manifolds of arbitrary spatial dimension. Their results substantially
generalize the existing surface finite element approximation theory in several
respects. In 2014, Gillette, Holst, and Zhu extended the FEEC in another
direction, namely to parabolic and hyperbolic evolution systems by combining
the FEEC framework for elliptic operators with classical approaches for
parabolic and hyperbolic operators, by viewing solutions to the evolution
problem as lying in Bochner spaces (spaces of Banach-space valued parametrized
curves). Related work on developing an FEEC theory for parabolic evolution
problems has also been done independently by Arnold and Chen. In this article,
we extend the work of Gillette-Holst-Zhu and Arnold-Chen to evolution problems

TM polarized light incident on a 16 layer structure at 76 degrees to the normal

from the multi-layered structure ensures high transmission. This is
significantly higher than Faraday rotations for the TM polarization at normal

the well-known join the shortest queue routing policy that takes into account
the non-identical service rates in addition to the number of jobs at each

demonstrated superior performance in various computer vision applications. This
is because visual data often forms a special structure lying on a lower

manifolds belong to non-Euclidean topological spaces, exploiting their
structures is computationally expensive, especially when one considers the
clustering analysis of massive amounts of data. To this end, we propose an
efficient framework to address the clustering problem on Riemannian manifolds.
This framework implements random projections for manifold points via kernel
space, which can preserve the geometric structure of the original space, but is
computationally efficient. Here, we introduce three methods that follow our
framework. We then validate our framework on several computer vision
applications by comparing against popular clustering methods on Riemannian

performance of the clustering whilst massively reducing computational
complexity by over two orders of magnitude in some cases.

realization of generic linear quantum stochastic systems for applications such

developed are algorithms for symplectic QR and Schur decompositions. It is
shown that generic real square matrices of even dimension can be transformed

energy-source models, because the spectral analysis shows that $\sim
2.5M_\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni have been synthesized but are inadequate to power the
peak bolometric emission of iPTF13ehe, while the rebrightening of the late-time

a triple-energy-source model, in which a magnetar together with some amount

the late-time rebrightening can be quantitatively explained by an ejecta-CSM

We found an analytical expression that minimizes the energy for each

be short compared to the duration of the trip, we take the nodal line of three

the linear Schr\""odinger equation (LSE) with periodic potentials in the

to the case with periodic media. It provides an efficient computational tool
based on asymptotic analysis on phase space and Bloch waves to capture the
high-frequency oscillations of the solution. Compared to geometric optics and
Gaussian beam methods, GIFGA works in both scenarios of caustics and beam
spreading. Moreover, it is invariant with respect to the gauge choice of the
Bloch eigenfunctions, and thus avoids the numerical difficulty of computing
gauge-dependent Berry phase. We numerically test the method by several
one-dimensional examples, in particular, the first order convergence is
validated, which agrees with our companion analysis paper [Delgadillo, Lu and

additional time scale to neuronal activities and causing many dynamic behaviors

provides a control option for adjusting the response of a neuron: e.g., an
autaptic connection can cause the electrical activities of the Hindmarsh-Rose

autapse can enhance or suppress the mode-locking status of a neuron injected
with sinusoidal current; and the firing frequency and interspike interval
distributions of the response spike train can also be modified by the autapse.

the multi-scale model parallelizes and reduces the computational problem by
simulating only several individual tapes at significant positions of the coil's

made of 2000 tapes, and compared against the widely used H-formulation finite

show that when an estimator obtained from an i.i.d. sample is viewed as a
random distribution, the KL risk of the estimator decomposes in a fashion
parallel to the mean squared error decomposition when the estimator is a
real-valued random variable. In this paper, we explore how conditional versions
of distribution expectation ($E^{\dagger}$) can be defined so that a
distribution version of the Rao-Blackwell theorem holds. We define
distributional expectation and variance ($V^{\dagger}$) that also provide a
decomposition of KL risk in exponential and mixture families. For exponential
families, we show that the maximum likelihood estimator (viewed as a random
distribution) is distribution unbiased and is the unique uniformly minimum
distribution variance unbiased (UMV$^{\dagger}$U) estimator. Furthermore, we
show that the MLE is robust against model specification in that if the true
distribution does not belong to the exponential family, the MLE is
UMV$^{\dagger}$U for the KL projection of the true distribution onto the
exponential families provided these two distribution have the same expectation
for the canonical statistic. To allow for estimators taking values outside of
the exponential family, we include results for KL projection and define an
extended projection to accommodate the non-existence of the MLE for families

the trace formula and its comparison with the explicit formulas. The second is
based on algebraic geometry and the Riemann-Roch theorem. We establish a
framework in which one can transpose many of the ingredients of the Weil proof

facets are defined by 2-connected factor-critical graphs, which have an odd
ear-decomposition (according to a theorem of Lov\'asz). In particular,
$\beta(G) \leq 1$ if and only if the matching polytope of the graph $G$ is
completely described by non-negativity, star and odd-circuit inequalities. This
is essentially equivalent to the h-perfection of the line-graph of $G$, as
observed by Cao and Nemhauser.
  The complexity of computing $\beta$ is apparently not known. We show that
deciding whether $\beta(G)\leq 1$ can be executed efficiently by looking at any
ear-decomposition starting with an odd circuit and performing basic modulo-2
computations. Such a greedy-approach is surprising in view of the complexity of
the problem in more special cases by Bruhn and Schaudt, and it is simpler than
using the Parity Minor Algorithm.

ten radio pulsars that were relatively less studied in this regard. The
observations were performed using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope at the
observing frequencies of 150, 235, 325, 610 and 1060~MHz. The data we
collected, in conjunction with the results from other frequencies published
earlier, allowed us to estimate the scatter time frequency scaling indices for
eight of these sources. For PSR J1852$-$0635 it occurred that its profile
undergoes a strong evolution with frequency, which makes the scatter time
measurements difficult to perform, and for PSR J1835$-$1020 we were able to
obtain reliable pulse broadening estimates at only two frequencies. We used the
eight frequency scaling indices to estimate both: the electron density
fluctuation strengths along the respective lines-of-sight, and the standardized
amount of scattering at the frequency of 1 GHz. Combining the new data with the
results published earlier by Lewandowski et al., we revisited the scaling index
versus the dispersion measure (DM) relation, and similarly to some of the
earlier studies we show that the average value of the scaling index deviates
from the theoretical predictions for large DM pulsars, however it reaches the
magnitude claimed by L\""ohmer et al. only for pulsars with very large DMs
($>$650 pc cm$^{-3}$). We also investigated the dependence of the scattering
strength indicators on the pulsar distance, DM, and the position of the source
in the Milky Way Galaxy.

accelerate the search. The termination conditions for the line search are based
on the well-known Wolfe conditions that are used to ensure the convergence and
stability of unconstrained optimization algorithms. The directions to search
for fixed points are generated by using the ideas of the steepest descent
direction and conventional nonlinear conjugate gradient directions for
unconstrained optimization. We perform convergence as well as convergence rate
analyses on the algorithms for solving the fixed point problem under certain
assumptions. The main contribution of this paper is to make a concrete response
to an issue of constrained smooth convex optimization; that is, whether or not
we can devise nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithms to solve constrained
smooth convex optimization problems. We show that the proposed fixed point
algorithms include ones with nonlinear conjugate gradient directions which can
solve constrained smooth convex optimization problems. To illustrate the
practicality of the algorithms, we apply them to concrete constrained smooth
convex optimization problems, such as constrained quadratic programming
problems and generalized convex feasibility problems, and numerically compare
them with previous algorithms based on the Krasnosel'ski\u\i-Mann fixed point
algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithms dramatically reduce
the running time and iterations needed to find optimal solutions to the
concrete optimization problems compared with the previous algorithms.

a new measurement of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) in the redshift range
$0.68<z<4.0$. Our sample is denser, reaches deeper than those used in previous
studies of the QLF, and is among the largest ones. At the faint end, our QLF
extends to $M_g(z\!=\!2)=-21.80$ at low redshift and to $M_g(z\!=\!2)=-26.20$

evolution (PLE) with bright-end and faint-end slopes allowed to be different on

model that comprises both luminosity and density evolution (LEDE) at $z>2.2$.
Both models are constrained to be continuous at $z=2.2$. They present a
flattening of the bright-end slope at large redshift. The LEDE model indicates
a reduction of the break density with increasing redshift, but the evolution of
the break magnitude depends on the parameterization. The models are in
excellent accord, predicting quasar counts that agree within 0.3\% (resp.,
1.1\%) to $g<22.5$ (resp., $g<23$). The models are also in good agreement over
the entire redshift range with models from previous studies.

from professional facilities which confirm and refine this finding, and
high-resolution imaging which show no evidence for nearby companions. We use
these data to determine a new and precise orbital ephemeris, and measure the
physical properties of the system. Our revised orbital period is 4.5s shorter
than found from the discovery data alone, which explains the early occurrence
of the transits. We also find both the star and planet to be larger and less
massive than previously thought. The measured mass and radius of the planet are
now consistent with theoretical models of gas giants containing no
heavy-element core, as expected for the sub-solar metallicity of the host star.
Two transits were observed simultaneously in four passbands. We use the
resulting light curves to measure the planet's radius as a function of
wavelength, finding that our data are sufficient in principle but not in
practise to constrain its atmospheric properties. We conclude with a discussion
of the current and future status of transmission photometry studies for probing
the atmospheres of gas-giant transiting planets.

detector has successfully detected its first neutrinos. We provide the second
shortest baseline measurement of the reactor neutrino flux. The detection of
electron antineutrinos emitted in the decay chains of the fission products,
combined with reactor core simulations, provides an new tool to assess both the
thermal power and the fissile content of the whole nuclear core and could be
used by the Inter- national Agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA) to enhance the
Safeguards of civil nuclear reactors. Deployed at only 7.2m away from the
compact Osiris research reactor core (70MW) operating at the Saclay research
centre of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA),
the experiment also exhibits a well-suited configuration to search for a new
short baseline oscillation. We report the first results of the Nucifer
experiment, describing the performances of the 0.85m3 detector remotely
operating at a shallow depth equivalent to 12m of water and under intense
background radiation conditions. Based on 145 (106) days of data with reactor
ON (OFF), leading to the detection of an estimated 40760 electron
antineutrinos, the mean number of detected antineutrinos is 281 +- 7(stat) +-
18(syst) electron antineutrinos/day, in agreement with the prediction 277(23)
electron antineutrinos/day. Due the the large background no conclusive results
on the existence of light sterile neutrinos could be derived, however. As a
first societal application we quantify how antineutrinos could be used for the
Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement.

graph $G$, given a pair of vertices $s$ and $t$, the maximum number of vertex
(edge) disjoint paths is equal to the minimum number of vertices (edges) needed
to disconnect from $s$ and $t$. This min-max result can be turned into a
polynomial time algorithm to find the maximum number of vertex (edge) disjoint
paths as well as the minimum number of vertices (edges) needed to disconnect
$s$ from $t$. In this paper we study a mixed version of this problem, called
Mixed-Cut, where we are given an undirected graph $G$, vertices $s$ and $t$,
positive integers $k$ and $l$ and the objective is to test whether there exist
a $k$ sized vertex set $S \subseteq V(G)$ and an $l$ sized edge set $F
\subseteq E(G)$ such that deletion of $S$ and $F$ from $G$ disconnects from $s$
and $t$. We start with a small observation that this problem is NP-complete and
then study this problem, in fact a much stronger generalization of this, in the
realm of parameterized complexity. In particular we study the Mixed-Multiway
Cut-Uncut problem where along with a set of terminals $T$, we are also given an
equivalence relation $\mathcal{R}$ on $T$, and the question is whether we can
delete at most $k$ vertices and at most $l$ edges such that connectivity of the
terminals in the resulting graph respects $\mathcal{R}$. Our main results is a
fixed parameter algorithm for Mixed-Multiway Cut-Uncut using the method of
recursive understanding introduced by Chitnis et al. (FOCS 2012).

coming from the study of dark matter where the $Z'$ represents a possible

potential for heavy $Z'$ (above $\sim 2~\mathrm{TeV}$). A combination of both

of dislocations. We seek to faithfully represent this evolution in terms of
density-like variables which average over the discrete dislocation

Principle' (MIEP) for deriving closed-form evolution equations for dislocation
density measures of different order. These equations provide an optimum
representation of the kinematic properties of systems of curved and connected
dislocation lines with the information contained in a given set of density
measures. The performance of the derived equations is benchmarked against other
models proposed in the literature, using discrete dislocation dynamics
simulations as a reference. As a benchmark problem we study dislocations moving
in a highly heterogeneous, persistent slip-band-like geometry. We demonstrate
that excellent agreement with discrete simulations can be obtained in terms of
a very small number of averaged dislocation fields containing information about
the edge and screw components of the total and excess (geometrically necessary)
dislocation densities. From these the full dislocation orientation distribution
which emerges as dislocations move through a channel-wall structure can be
faithfully reconstructed.

cooperative networks, where spatially random relays are equipped with energy
storage devices e.g., batteries. In contrast to conventional techniques and in
order to reduce complexity, the relay nodes can either harvest energy from the
source signal (in case of uncharged battery) or attempt to decode and forward
it (in case of charged battery). Several relay selection schemes that
correspond to different state information requirements and implementation
complexities are proposed. The charging/discharging behavior of the battery is
modeled as a two-state Markov chain and analytical expressions for the
steady-state distribution and the outage probability performance are derived
for each relay selection scheme. We prove that energy storage significantly
affects the performance of the system and results in a zeroth diversity gain at
high signal-to-noise ratios; the convergence floors depend on the steady-state
distribution of the battery and are derived in closed-form by using appropriate
approximations. The proposed relay selection schemes are generalized to a
large-scale network with multiple access points (APs), where relays assist the
closest AP and suffer from multi-user interference.

known as ""shape noise,"" is the most important source of noise in weak lensing
shear measurements. Several approaches to reducing shape noise have recently
been put forward, using information beyond photometry, such as radio
polarization and optical spectroscopy. Here we investigate how well the
intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies can be predicted using other, exclusively
photometric parameters. These parameters (such as galaxy colours) are already
available in the data and do not necessitate additional, often expensive
observations. We apply two regression techniques, generalized additive models
(GAM) and projection pursuit regression (PPR) to the publicly released data
catalog of galaxy properties from CFHTLenS. In our simple analysis we find that
the individual galaxy ellipticities can indeed be predicted from other
photometric parameters to better precision than the scatter about the mean
ellipticity. This means that without additional observations beyond photometry
the ellipticity contribution to the shear can be measured to higher precision,
comparable to using a larger sample of galaxies. Our best-fit model, achieved
using PPR, yields a gain equivalent to having 114.3% more galaxies. Using only
parameters unaffected by lensing (e.g.~surface brightness, colour), the gain is
only ~12%.

information is used for benchmarking data-driven modelling of the upflows
(Galsgaard et al., 2015). The studied AR upflow displays blueshifted emission
of 5-20 km/s in Fe XII and Fe XIII and its average electron density is 1.8x10^9
cm^3 at 1 MK. The time variation of the density shows no significant change (in
a 3sigma error). The plasma density along a single loop drops by 50% over a
distance of 20000 km. We find a second velocity component in the blue wing of
the Fe XII and Fe XIII lines at 105 km/s. This component is persistent during
the whole observing period of 3.5 hours with variations of only 15 km/s. We
also study the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field and find that
magnetic flux diffusion is responsible for the formation of the upflow region.
High cadence Halpha observations of the chromosphere at the footpoints of the
upflow region show no significant jet-like (spicule/rapid blue excursion)
activity to account for several hours/days of plasma upflow. Using an image
enhancement technique, we show that the coronal structures seen in the AIA 193A
channel is comparable to the EIS Fe XII images, while images in the AIA 171A
channel reveals additional loops that are a result of contribution from cooler
emission to this channel. Our results suggest that at chromospheric heights
there are no signatures that support the possible contribution of spicules to
AR upflows. We suggest that magnetic flux diffusion is responsible for the
formation of the coronal upflows. The existence of two velocity components
possibly indicate the presence of two different flows which are produced by two
different physical mechanisms, e.g. magnetic reconnection and pressure-driven.

these variations are established to be connected with the appearance of the
high accretion column above the neutron star surface, at low, sub-critical
luminosities the nature of the variations (but with the opposite sign) has not
been discussed widely. We argue here that the cyclotron line is formed when the
radiation from a hotspot propagates through the plasma falling with a mildly
relativistic velocity onto the neutron star surface. The position of the
cyclotron resonance is determined by the Doppler effect. The change of the
cyclotron line position in the spectrum with luminosity is caused by variations
of the velocity profile in the line-forming region affected by the radiation
pressure force. The presented model has several characteristic features: (i)
the line centroid energy is positively correlated with the luminosity; (ii) the
line width is positively correlated with the luminosity as well; (iii) the
position and the width of the cyclotron absorption line are variable over the
pulse phase; (iv) the line has a more complicated shape than widely used

their electronic band structure evolution, we discover two types of Dirac
fermion states emerging in the low-energy spectrum. One pair of (type-I) Dirac

points are located at generic $k$-points, with different anisotropic
dispersions determined by the reduced symmetries at their locations. Such
fully-unpinned (type-II) 2D Dirac points are discovered for the first time. In
the absence of spin-orbit coupling, we find that each Dirac node is protected
by the sublattice symmetry from gap opening, which is in turn ensured by any
one of three point group symmetries. The spin-orbit coupling generally gaps the
Dirac nodes, and for the type-I case, this drives the system into a quantum
spin Hall insulator phase. We suggest possible ways to realize the unpinned
Dirac points in strained phosphorene.

magnetic flux redistribution during prestellar core collapse by including
resistive terms in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. We focus more
particularly on the impact of ambipolar diffusion. We use the adaptive mesh
refinement code RAMSES to carry out such calculations. The resistivities
required to calculate the ambipolar diffusion terms were computed using a
reduced chemical network of charged, neutral and grain species. The inclusion
of ambipolar diffusion leads to the formation of a magnetic diffusion barrier
in the vicinity of the core, preventing accumulation of magnetic flux in and
around the core and amplification of the field above 0.1G. The mass and radius
of the first Larson core remain similar between ideal and non-ideal MHD models.
This diffusion plateau has crucial consequences on magnetic braking processes,
allowing the formation of disk structures. Magnetically supported outflows
launched in ideal MHD models are weakened when using non-ideal MHD. Contrary to
ideal MHD misalignment between the initial rotation axis and the magnetic field
direction does not significantly affect the results for a given mu, showing
that the physical dissipation truly dominate over numerical diffusion. We
demonstrate severe limits of the ideal MHD formalism, which yield unphysical
behaviours in the long-term evolution of the system. This includes counter
rotation inside the outflow, interchange instabilities, and flux redistribution
triggered by numerical diffusion, none observed in non-ideal MHD. Disks with
Keplerian velocity profiles form in all our non-ideal MHD simulations, with
final mass and size which depend on the initial magnetisation. This ranges from
a few 0.01 solar masses and 20-30 au for the most magnetised case (mu=2) to 0.2
solar masses and 40-80 au for a lower magnetisation (mu=5).

Magnetic Imager (HMI) data to provide an initial potential three dimensional
magnetic field of the active region NOAA 11123 on 2010 November 13 where the
characteristic upflow velocities are observed. A simple one-dimensional
hydrostatic atmospheric model covering the region from the photosphere to the
corona is derived. Local Correlation Tracking of the magnetic features in the
HMI data is used to derive a proxy for the time dependent velocity field. The
time dependent evolution of the system is solved using a resistive
three-dimensional MagnetoHydro-Dynamic code. Results. The magnetic field
contains several null points located well above the photosphere, with their fan
planes dividing the magnetic field into independent open and closed flux
domains. The stressing of the interfaces between the different flux domains is
expected to provide locations where magnetic reconnection can take place and
drive systematic flows. In this case, the region between the closed and open
flux is identified as the region where observations find the systematic
upflows. Conclusions. In the present experiment, the driving only initiates
magneto-acoustic waves, without driving any systematic upflows at any of the
flux interfaces.

the phase space of parameters which minimizes the Mean First Passage Time

how actually an interesting dynamics, including also phase transitions for the
minimization of the MFPT, can also be obtained without invoking the use of
L\'evy statistics but for the simpler case of random walks with exponentially
distributed flights of constant speed. We explore this dynamics both in the
case of finite and infinite domains, and for different implementations of the
resetting mechanism to show that different ways to introduce resetting
consistently lead to a quite similar dynamics. The use of exponential flights
has the strong advantage that exact solutions can be obtained easily for the
MFPT through the origin, so a complete analytical characterization of the
system dynamics can be provided. Furthermore, we discuss in detail how the
phase transitions observed in random walks with resetting are closely related
to several ideas recurrently used in the field of random search theory, in
particular to other mechanisms proposed to understand random search in space as
mortal random-walks or multi-scale random-walks. As a whole we corroborate that
one of the essential ingredients behind MFPT minimization lies in the
combination of multiple movement scales (whatever its origin).

posteriori error estimation within the generalized multiscale finite element

error in the goal functional. Our first error estimator uses a residual based
strategy where local indicators on each coarse neighborhood are the product of
local indicators for the primal and dual problems, respectively. In the second
approach, viewed as the multiscale extension of the dual weighted residual
method (DWR), the error indicators are computed as the pairing of the local
H^{-1} residual of the primal problem weighed by a projection into the primal
space of the H_0^1 dual solution from an enriched space, over each coarse
neighborhood. In both of these strategies, the goal-oriented indicators are
then used in place of a standard residual-based indicator to mark coarse
neighborhoods of the mesh for further enrichment in the form of additional
multiscale basis functions. The method is demonstrated on high-contrast
problems with heterogeneous multiscale coefficients, and is seen to outperform
the standard residual based strategy with respect to efficient reduction of

We fit all the 2--10 keV spectra from 1H 0707-495 using the same wind model as

line is broader but not so blueshifted. This gives a good overall fit to the

also gives a good match to the NuSTAR data. Small remaining residuals indicate
that the iron line emission is stronger than in PDS 456. This is consistent
with the wider angle wind expected from a continuum driven wind from the
super-Eddington mass accretion rate in 1H 0707-495, and/or the presence of
residual reflection from the underlying disk though the presence of the

whatever the model, its parameters can always be adjusted to fit symmetric

Here, we systematically examine popular models based on tunneling barrier or

deduced in this way may fall in ranges rendering a specific model invalid or
incompatible to ab initio estimates. We exemplify with the benchmark case of
oligophenylene-based junctions, for which results of ab initio quantum chemical

condensates by studying the many-particle description of a two-mode condensate
with balanced gain and loss. This is achieved using a master equation in
Lindblad form whose mean-field limit is a PT-symmetric Gross-Pitaevskii

small values but then is nearly completely restored. This has a direct impact
on the average contrast in interference experiments which cannot be covered by
the mean-field approximation, in which a completely pure condensate is assumed.

disk as a function of the limb angle. Across strong absorption lines, the CLV
can vary quite significantly. We obtained a densely sampled time series of
high-resolution transit spectra of the active planet host star HD 189733 with
UVES. Using the passing planetary disk of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b as a
probe, we study the CLV in the wings of the Ca II H and K and Na I D1 and D2
Fraunhofer lines, which are not strongly affected by activity-induced
variability. In agreement with model predictions, our analysis shows that the
wings of the studied Fraunhofer lines are limb brightened with respect to the
(quasi-)continuum. The strength of the CLV-induced effect can be on the same
order as signals found for hot Jupiter atmospheres. Therefore, a careful
treatment of the wavelength dependence of the stellar CLV in strong absorption
lines is highly relevant in the interpretation of planetary transit
spectroscopy.

nonstationary source is characterized by reverse waterfilling in the
time-frequency plane. Constraints on the average energy or on the squared-error
distortion, respectively, are used. The source is formed by the white Gaussian
noise response of the same LTV filter as before. The proofs of both
waterfilling theorems rely on a Szego theorem for a class of operators

given. The waterfilling theorems compare well with the classical results of
Gallager and Berger. In the case of a nonstationary source, it is observed that
the part of the classical power spectral density is taken by the Wigner-Ville

generalized interpolation with divergence-free and curl-free RBFs. Unlike
traditional projection methods, this new method enables matching both
tangential and normal components of divergence-free vector fields on the domain
boundary. This allows incompressibility of the velocity field to be enforced
without any time-splitting or pressure boundary conditions. Spatial derivatives
are approximated using collocation with global RBFs so that the method only
requires samples of the field at (possibly scattered) nodes over the domain.

image collection recommendation as a dynamic similarity measurement problem in

the similarity between the image collection and the clicked image set. As there

$(MC_*(Y;R),\partial)$ is generated by quadruples $[V,n,s,t]$ satisfying
relations, where $V$ is an oriented manifold with corners, $n\in\mathbb N$, and
$s:V\to{\mathbb R}^n$, $t:V\to Y$ are smooth with $s$ proper near 0 in
${\mathbb R}^n$.
  We show that $MH_*(Y;R),MH^*(Y;R)$ satisfy the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, and
so are canonically isomorphic to conventional (co)homology. The usual
operations on (co)homology -- pushforwards $f_*$, pullbacks $f^*$, fundamental
classes $[Y]$ for compact oriented $Y$, cup, cap and cross products
$\cup,\cap,\times$ -- are all defined and well-behaved at the (co)chain level.
Chains $MC_*(Y;R)$ form flabby cosheaves on $Y$, and cochains $MC^*(Y;R)$ form
soft sheaves on $Y$, so they have good gluing properties.
  We also define $compactly$-$supported$ $M$-$cohomology$ $MH^*_{cs}(Y;R)$,
$locally$ $finite$ $M$-$homology$ $MH_*^{lf}(Y;R)$ (a kind of Borel-Moore
homology), and two variations on the entire theory, $rational$
$M$-($co$)$homology$ and $de$ $Rham$ $M$-($co$)$homology$. All of these are
canonically isomorphic to the corresponding type of conventional (co)homology.
  The reason for doing this is that our M-(co)homology theories are very well
behaved at the (co)chain level, and will be better than other (co)homology
theories for some purposes, particularly in problems involving transversality.
In a sequel we will construct virtual classes and virtual chains for Kuranishi
spaces in M-(co)homology, with a view to applications of M-(co)homology in

These temporal analysis methods allow us to investigate the details of AE
events that follow a power-law distribution. In the actual time analysis, the
calm time distribution and the decay of the event-occurrence density after the
largest event (i.e., Omori-Utsu law) are measured. Although the former always
shows a power-law form, the latter does not always obey a power law.
Markovianity of the event-occurrence process is also verified using a scaling
law by assuming that both of them exhibit power laws. We find that the
effective shear strain rate is a key parameter to classify the emergence rate
of power-law nature and Markovianity in the granular AE events. For the natural
time analysis, the existence of self organized critical (SOC) states is
revealed by calculating the variance of natural time $\chi_k$, where $k$th
natural time of N events is defined as $\chi_k=k/N$. In addition, the energy
difference distribution can be fitted by a $q$-Gaussian form, which is also
consistent with the criticality of the system.

modelled as an n-dimensional vector. The spectral angle mapper computes the
angle between the vectors which is used to discriminate the species. The
spectral information divergence models the data as a probability distribution
so that the spectral variability between the bands can be extracted using the
stochastic measures. The hybrid approach of spectral angle mapper and spectral
information divergence is found to be better discriminator than spectral angle
mapper or spectral information divergence alone. The spectral correlation angle
is computed as a cosine of the angle of the Pearsonian correlation coefficient
between the vectors. The spectral correlation angle is a better measure than
the spectral angle mapper as it considers only standardized values of the
vectors rather than the absolute values of the vector. In the present paper a
new hybrid measure is proposed which is based on the spectral correlation angle
and the spectral information divergence. The proposed method has been compared
with the hybrid approach of spectral information divergence and spectral angle
mapper for discrimination of crops belonging to Vigna species using measures
like relative spectral discriminatory power, relative discriminatory
probability and relative discriminatory entropy in different spectral regions.
Experimental results using the laboratory spectra show that the proposed method
gives higher relative discriminatory power in 400nm-700nm spectral region.

properties, graphene is being explored for a wide array of applications and has
attracted enormous academic and industrial interest. Graphene and its
derivatives have also been considered as promising nanoscale fillers in gas
barrier application of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). In this review, recent
research and development of the utilization of graphene and its derivatives in
the fabrication of nanocomposites with different polymer matrices for barrier
application are explored. Most synthesis methods of graphene-based PNCs are
covered, including solution and melt mixing, in situ polymerization and
layer-by-layer process. Graphene layers in polymer matrix are able to produce a
tortuous path which works as a barrier structure for gases. A high tortuosity
leads to higher barrier properties and lower permeability of PNCs. The
influence of the intrinsic properties of these fillers (graphene and its
derivatives) and their state of dispersion in polymer matrix on the gas barrier
properties of graphene/PNCs are discussed. Analytical modeling aspects of
barrier performance of graphene/PNCs are also reviewed in detail. We also
discuss and address some of the work on mixed matrix membranes for gas
separation.

  half-space characterized by the Toupin-Mindlin gradient theory",,,,,"physics.class-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The existence of torsional and SH surface waves in a half-space of a
homogeneous and isotropic material is shown to be possible in the context of
the complete Toupin-Mindlin theory of gradient elasticity. This finding is in
marked contrast with the well-known result of the classical theory, where such
waves do not exist in a homogeneous (isotropic or anisotropic) half-space. In
the context of the classical theory, this weakness is usually circumvented by
modeling the half-space as a layered structure or as having non-homogeneous
properties. On the other hand, employing a simplified version of gradient
elasticity (including only one microstructural parameter and an additional
surface-energy term), Vardoulakis and Georgiadis (1997), and Georgiadis et al.
(2000), showed that such surface waves may exist in a homogeneous half-space
only if a certain type of gradient anisotropy is included in the formulation.
On the contrary, in the present work, we prove that the complete Toupin-Mindlin
theory of isotropic gradient elasticity (with five microstructural parameters)
is capable of predicting torsional and SH surface waves in a purely isotropic
and homogeneous material. In fact, it is shown that torsional and SH surface
waves are dispersive and can propagate at any frequency (i.e. no cut-off
frequencies appear). The character of the dispersion (either normal or
anomalous) depends strongly upon the microstructural characteristics.

closely follows Newcomb-Benford's law, namely P(d)=log(1+1/d). The
discrepancies between Newcomb-Benford's law and first-digits frequencies in
turbulent data are analysed through Shannon's entropy. The data sets are
obtained with direct numerical simulations for two types of fluid flow: an
isotropic case initialized with a Taylor-Green vortex and a channel flow.
Results are in agreement with Newcomb-Benford's law in nearly homogeneous cases
and the discrepancies are related to intermittent events. Thus the scale
invariance for the first significant digits, which supports Newcomb-Benford's
law, seems to be related to an equilibrium turbulent state, namely with a
significant inertial range. A matlab/octave program is provided in appendix in

species. It appears to be a promising candidate for biocontrol of some mosquito
borne diseases. We begin by developing a sex-structured model for a Wolbachia
infected mosquito population. Our model incorporates the key effects of
Wolbachia infection including cytoplasmic incompatibility and male killing. We
also allow the possibility of reduced reproductive output, incomplete maternal
transmission, and different mortality rates for uninfected/infected male/female
individuals. We study the existence and local stability of equilibria,
including the biologically relevant and interesting boundary equilibria. For
some biologically relevant parameter regimes there may be multiple coexistence
steady states including, very importantly, a coexistence steady state in which
Wolbachia infected individuals dominate. We also extend the model to
incorporate West Nile virus (WNv) dynamics, using an SEI modelling approach.
Recent evidence suggests that a particular strain of Wolbachia infection
significantly reduces WNv replication in Aedes aegypti. We model this via
increased time spent in the WNv-exposed compartment for Wolbachia infected
female mosquitoes. A basic reproduction number $R_0$ is computed for the WNv
infection. Our results suggest that, if the mosquito population consists mainly
of Wolbachia infected individuals, WNv eradication is likely if WNv replication
in Wolbachia infected individuals is sufficiently reduced.

periodic functions may be represented as Fourier series with an infinite number
of coefficients, this is impossible for a finite number of the observations.
Thus one may use a restricted Fourier series, i.e. a trigonometric polynomial
(TP) of order s either for fitting the light curve, or to make a periodogram
analysis. However, the number of parameters needed drastically increases with
decreasing width of minimum. In the NAV algorithm, the special shape of minimum
is used, so the number of parameters is limited to 10 (if the period and
initial epoch are fixed) or 12 (not fixed). We illustrate the NAV method by
application to a recently discovered Algol-type eclipsing variable 2MASS
J11080308-6145589 (in the field of previously known variable star RS Car) and
compare results to that obtained using the TP fits. For this system, the
statistically optimal number of parameters is 44, but the fit is still worse
than that of the NAV fit. Application to the system GSC 3692-00624 argues that
the NAV fit is better than the TP one even for the case of EW-type stars with
much wider eclipses. Model parameters are listed.
