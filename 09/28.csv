origami, has inspired design of mechanical metamaterials. Mechanical
metamaterials are artificially engineered materials with uncommon properties.
Miura-ori is a remarkable origami folding pattern with metamaterial properties
and a wide range of applications. In this study, by dislocating the zigzag
strips of a Miura-ori pattern along the joining ridges, we create a class of
one-degree of freedom (DOF) cellular mechanical metamaterials. The resulting
configurations are based on a unit cell in which two zigzag strips surround a
hole with a parallelogram cross section. We show that dislocating zigzag strips
of the Miura-ori along the joining ridges, preserves and/or tunes the
outstanding properties of the Miura-ori. The introduced materials are lighter
than their corresponding Miura-ori sheets due to the presence of holes in the
patterns. Moreover, they are amenable to similar modifications available for
Miura-ori which make them appropriate for a wide range of applications.

their asphericity and prolateness, are characterized by measuring the gyration

particle tracers, emitted from different places in a homogeneous and isotropic
turbulent fluid with Taylor-scale Reynolds number $Re_\lambda \sim 300$. We
also analyze the probability of hitting a given target placed downstream with

different cases: (i) without any reconstruction of the shape, i.e. considering
the bunch of point tracers, and approximating the particle-puff as a (ii)

fluctuations of the instantaneous wind at the moment of the emission and appear

bispectrum with theoretically motivated templates. However, as a complementary
approach one can also smooth the binned bispectrum using a variable smoothing
scale in order to suppress noise and make coherent features stand out above the
noise. This allows one to look in a model-independent way for any statistically
significant bispectral signal. This approach is useful for characterizing the
bispectral shape of the galactic foreground emission, for which a theoretical
prediction of the bispectral anisotropy is lacking, and for detecting a
serendipitous primordial signal, for which a theoretical template has not yet
been put forth. Both the template-based and the non-parametric approaches are

The NuSTAR data provide a clear detection of this magnetar's persistent
emission up to 20 keV. We detect a previously unreported small secondary peak
in the average pulse profile in the 7-10 keV band, which grows to an amplitude
comparable to that of the main peak in the 10--20 keV band. We show using RXTE
data that this secondary peak is likely transient. We find that the pulsed
fraction increases with energy from a value of $\sim$0.55 at $\sim$2 keV to a
value of $\sim$0.75 near 8 keV but shows evidence for decreasing at higher
energies. After filtering out multiple bright X-ray bursts during the
observation, we find that the phase-averaged spectrum from combined NuSTAR and
XMM data is well described by an absorbed double blackbody plus power-law
model, with no evidence for the spectral turn-up near $\sim$10 keV as has been
seen in some other magnetars. Our data allow us to rule out a spectral turn-up
similar to those seen in magnetars 4U 0142+61 and 1E 2259+586 of $\Delta\Gamma

hard-band photon indexes. The absence of a significant spectral turn-up is
consistent with what has been observed from a particularly active subset of

spin-down rate and/or spin-inferred magnetic field strength.

  We demonstrate the techniques by showing applications to Max-Cut on dense
graphs, approximate clique on graphs that contain a large clique, constraint
satisfaction problems on dense bipartite graphs and the list decoding to unique
decoding problem for the Reed-Muller code.

  variable sets",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given data obtained under two sampling conditions, it is often of interest to
identify variables that behave differently in one condition than in the other.
We introduce a method for differential analysis of second-order behavior called
Differential Correlation Mining (DCM). The DCM method identifies differentially
correlated sets of variables, with the property that the average pairwise
correlation between variables in a set is higher under one sample condition
than the other. DCM is based on an iterative search procedure that adaptively
updates the size and elements of a candidate variable set. Updates are
performed via hypothesis testing of individual variables, based on the
asymptotic distribution of their average differential correlation. We
investigate the performance of DCM by applying it to simulated data as well as
recent experimental datasets in genomics and brain imaging.

for frit-disc alumina crucible sets that has made their use in the growth

alumina frit-disc allows for the clean separation of the residual liquid from
the solid phase. This allows for the reuse of the decanted liquid, either for
further growth of the same phase, or for subsequent growth of other, related

relative periodic orbits, their torus bifurcations, a transition to chaos via
torus breakdown, and heteroclinic connections between various relative periodic
orbits. It would be very hard to carry through such analysis in the full state

a topologically ordered ground state with (2) projective stabilizer

order (NLO) spin-spin coupling for black hole binaries endowed with arbitrarily
oriented spins. The Hamiltonian is based on the model for parallel spins and
equatorial orbits developed in [Physical Review D 90, 044018 (2014)], but
differs from it in several ways. In particular, the NLO spin-spin coupling is
not incorporated by a redefinition of the centrifugal radius $r_c$, but by
separately modifying certain sectors of the Hamiltonian, which are identified
according to their dependence on the momentum vector. The gauge-fixing
procedure we follow allows us to reduce the 25 different terms of the NLO
spin-spin Hamiltonian in Arnowitt-Deser-Misner coordinates to only 9 EOB terms.
This is an improvement with respect to the EOB model recently proposed in
[Physical Review D 91, 064011 (2015)], where 12 EOB terms were involved.
Another important advantage is the remarkably simple momentum structure of the
spin-spin terms in the effective Hamiltonian, which is simply quadratic up to
an overall square root. Moreover, a Damour-Jaranowski-Sch\""afer-type gauge
could be established, thus allowing one to concentrate, in the case of circular
and equatorial orbits, the whole spin-spin interaction in a single radial
potential.

corrupted with process and measurement noise, and study how the selection of
its sensors affects the estimation error of the corresponding Kalman filter
over a finite observation interval. Our contributions are threefold: First, we
prove that the minimum mean square error of the Kalman filter decreases only
linearly as the number of sensors increases. That is, adding extra sensors so
to reduce this estimation error is ineffective, a fundamental design limit.
Similarly, we prove that the number of sensors grows linearly with the system's
size for fixed minimum mean square error and number of output measurements over
an observation interval; this is another fundamental limit, especially for
systems where the system's size is large. Second, we prove that the logdet of
the error covariance of the Kalman filter, which captures the volume of the
corresponding confidence ellipsoid, with respect to the system's initial
condition and process noise is a supermodular and non-increasing set function
in the choice of the sensor set. Therefore, it exhibits the diminishing returns
property. Third, we provide efficient approximation algorithms that select a
small number sensors so to optimize the Kalman filter with respect to this
estimation error ---the worst-case performance guarantees of these algorithms
are provided as well. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency of our algorithms
using the problem of surface-based monitoring of CO2 sequestration sites
studied in Weimer et al. (2008).

distribution schemes which are generalizations of the original KLJN scheme. The
first of these, the Random-Resistor (RR-) KLJN scheme, uses random resistors
with values chosen from a quasi-continuum set. It is well-known since the
creation of the KLJN concept that such a system could work in cryptography,
because Alice and Bob can calculate the unknown resistance value from
measurements, but the RR-KLJN system has not been addressed in prior
publications since it was considered impractical. The reason for discussing it
now is the second scheme, the Random-Resistor-Random-Temperature (RRRT-) KLJN
key exchange, inspired by a recent paper of Vadai, Mingesz and Gingl, wherein
security was shown to be maintained at non-zero power flow. In the RRRT-KLJN
secure key exchange scheme, both the resistances and their temperatures are
continuum random variables. We prove that the security of the RRRT-KLJN scheme
can prevail at non-zero power flow, and thus the physical law guaranteeing
security is not the Second Law of Thermodynamics but the
Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. Alice and Bob know their own resistances and
temperatures and can calculate the resistance and temperature values at the
other end of the communication channel from measured voltage, current and
power-flow data in the wire. However, Eve cannot determine these values
because, for her, there are four unknown quantities while she can set up only
three equations. The RRRT-KLJN scheme has several advantages and makes all
former attacks on the KLJN scheme invalid or incomplete.

  Joint Differential Privacy","17 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-agent coordination problems often require agents to exchange state
information in order to reach some collective goal, such as agreement on a
final state value. In some cases, it is feasible that opportunistic agents may
deceptively report false state values for their own benefit, e.g., to claim a
larger portion of shared resources. Motivated by such cases, this paper
presents a multi-agent coordination framework which disincentivizes
opportunistic misreporting of state information. This paper focuses on
multi-agent coordination problems that can be stated as nonlinear programs,
with non-separable constraints coupling the agents. In this setting, an
opportunistic agent may be tempted to skew the problem's constraints in its
favor to reduce its local cost, and this is exactly the behavior we seek to
disincentivize. The framework presented uses a primal-dual approach wherein the
agents compute primal updates and a centralized cloud computer computes dual
updates. All computations performed by the cloud are carried out in a way that
enforces joint differential privacy, which adds noise in order to dilute any
agent's influence upon the value of its cost function in the problem. We show
that this dilution deters agents from intentionally misreporting their states
to the cloud, and present bounds on the possible cost reduction an agent can
attain through misreporting its state. This work extends our earlier work on
incorporating ordinary differential privacy into multi-agent optimization, and
we show that this work can be modified to provide a disincentivize for
misreporting states to the cloud. Numerical results are presented to
demonstrate convergence of the optimization algorithm under joint differential
privacy.

the galaxy cluster Abell $1689$ are used to test these models. To perform this
analysis we modify the LENSTOOL lens modeling code. The value added by this
probe is compared with other complementary probes: Type Ia supernovae (SNIa),
baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic microwave background (CMB). We
found that the CPL constraints obtained of the SL data are consistent with
those estimated using the other probes. The IDE constraints are consistent with
the complementary bounds only if large errors in the SL measurements are
considered. The Ricci HDE and MPC constraints are weak but they are similar to
the BAO, SNIa and CMB estimations. We also compute the figure-of-merit as a
tool to quantify the goodness of fit of the data. Our results suggest that the
SL method provides statistically significant constraints on the CPL parameters
but weak for those of the other models. Finally, we show that the use of the SL
measurements in galaxy clusters is a promising and powerful technique to
constrain cosmological models. The advantage of this method is that
cosmological parameters are estimated by modelling the SL features for each
underlying cosmology. These estimations could be further improved by SL
constraints coming from other galaxy clusters.

classical limit of the null vector decoupling equation for some degenerate
irregular block. Therefore, it seems to be possible to investigate the spectrum
of the Mathieu operator employing the techniques of 2d CFT. To exploit this
strategy, a full correspondence between the Mathieu equation and its
realization within 2d CFT has to be established. In our previous paper [1], we
have found that the expression of the Mathieu eigenvalue given in terms of the
classical irregular block exactly coincides with the well known weak coupling
expansion of this eigenvalue in the case in which the auxiliary parameter is
the noninteger Floquet exponent. In the present work we verify that the formula
for the corresponding eigenfunction obtained from the irregular block
reproduces the so-called Mathieu exponent from which the noninteger order
elliptic cosine and sine functions may be constructed. The derivation of the
Mathieu equation within the formalism of 2d CFT is based on conjectures
concerning the asymptotic behaviour of irregular blocks in the classical limit.
A proof of these hypotheses is sketched. Finally, we speculate on how it could
be possible to use the methods of 2d CFT in order to get from the irregular
block the eigenvalues of the Mathieu operator in other regions of the coupling
constant.

model provides closed-form expressions for I-V based on: 1) a modified version
of the well-known Fowler-Nordheim (FN) formula (in the ON-state), and 2) an
equation which describes the OFF-state performance while providing continuity
at the ON/OFF threshold by means of a term introduced as the ""continuity

TFETs only through correct evaluation of the total band bending distance and
the ""tunneling effective mass"". General expressions for these two key

effective mass captures both the ellipticity of evanescent states and the dual

interpretations of the term's precise meaning. This paper classifies and
explores definitions of resilience from the ecological literature using a
dynamical systems framework. A model consisting of ordinary differential
equations is assumed to represent the ecological system. The question
""resilience of what to what?"" posed by Carpenter et al. [2001] informs two
broad categories of definitions, based on resilience to state variable
perturbations and to parameter changes, respectively. Definitions of resilience
to state variable perturbations include measures of basin size (relevant to
one-time perturbations) and of basin steepness (relevant to repeated
perturbations). Resilience to parameter changes can be quantified by viewing
parameters as state variables, but could also take into account reversibility.
The dynamical systems viewpoint yields the following key insights: (i) system
properties that confer resistance to state variable perturbations can differ
from those that promote recovery from them, (ii) recovery rates, oft deemed the
purview of ""engineering resilience,"" do matter for ecological resilience, and
(iii) resilience to repeated state variable perturbations correlates with
resilience to parameter changes due to the critical slowing down phenomenon.

show that the original integration path becomes equivalent to a single
Lefschetz thimble at small and large chemical potentials, while in the

Finally, reducing the model to a uniform field space, we study the relative
importance of multiple thimble contributions and their behavior toward
continuum and low-temperature limits quantitatively, and see how the rapid
crossover behavior is recovered by adding the multi thimble contributions at
low temperatures. Those findings will be useful for performing Monte-Carlo

Networks (CDNs) for geo-replicated HTTP-services consists of multiple layers of
proxy nodes for service and co-located DNS-servers for load-balancing on
different proxies. Both the proxies and the DNS-servers use anycast addressing,
which offers simplicity of design and high availability of service at the cost
of partial loss of routing control. Due to the very nature of anycast,
load-management decisions by a co-located DNS-server also affects loads at
nearby proxies in the network. This makes the problem of distributed load
management highly challenging. In this paper, we propose an analytical
framework to formulate and solve the load-management problem in this context.
We consider two distinct algorithms. In the first half of the paper, we pose
the load-management problem as a convex optimization problem. Following a dual
decomposition technique, we propose a fully-distributed load management
algorithm by introducing FastControl packets. This algorithm utilizes the
underlying anycast mechanism itself to enable effective coordination among the
nodes, thus obviating the need for any external control channel. In the second
half of the paper, we consider an alternative greedy load-management heuristic,
currently in production in a major commercial CDN. We study its dynamical
characteristics and analytically identify its operational and stability
properties. Finally, we critically evaluate both the algorithms and explore
their optimality-vs-complexity trade-off using trace-driven simulations.

  Prediction","9 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stereo matching is the key step in estimating depth from two or more images.
Recently, some tree-based non-local stereo matching methods have been proposed,
which achieved state-of-the-art performance. The algorithms employed some tree
structures to aggregate cost and thus improved the performance and reduced the
coputation load of the stereo matching. However, the computational complexity
of these tree-based algorithms is still high because they search over the
entire disparity range. In addition, the extreme greediness of the minimum
spanning tree (MST) causes the poor performance in large areas with similar
colors but varying disparities. In this paper, we propose an efficient stereo
matching method using a hierarchical disparity prediction (HDP) framework to
dramatically reduce the disparity search range so as to speed up the tree-based
non-local stereo methods. Our disparity prediction scheme works on a graph
pyramid derived from an image whose disparity to be estimated. We utilize the
disparity of a upper graph to predict a small disparity range for the lower
graph. Some independent disparity trees (DT) are generated to form a disparity
prediction forest (HDPF) over which the cost aggregation is made. When combined
with the state-of-the-art tree-based methods, our scheme not only dramatically
speeds up the original methods but also improves their performance by
alleviating the second drawback of the tree-based methods. This is partially
because our DTs overcome the extreme greediness of the MST. Extensive
experimental results on some benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of our framework. For example, the segment-tree based stereo
matching becomes about 25.57 times faster and 2.2% more accurate over the
Middlebury 2006 full-size dataset.

simple Lie groups into seven types. Representation of a Lie group is a
homomorphism from the Lie group to the automorphism group of a vector space. In
general represenations of Lie group are determined by its Lie algebra and its
the connected components. We may consider operations like direct sum and tensor
product with respect to which the representations of G form a ring R(G). Assume
the group is compact. For every Lie group we may find a maximal torus inside of
it. By projecting the representation ring of the Lie group to the
representation ring of its maximal torus, we may consider to express R(T)

is important to improve the way of conveying the measurement results so that
EPR pairs are not affected by noises during classical communications. One
solution is execution in the blind mode. In the blind mode, correction
operations of multiple ES operations and multiple EPP operations are performed
in a lump after EPR pairs are shared between the sender and the receiver. That
is, the following quantum operations are performed without performing
correction operations of the former quantum operations. The protocol in the
conventional blind mode uses concatenated CSS codes. Therefore, the number of
qubits gets large as the communication distance gets long. This paper proposes
quantum repeater protocols which can be executed in the blind mode and can be
constructed by using CSS codes of single encoding. This result shows that
posterior processing can reduce the size of encoded states in some cases.
Additionally, the results of this paper show that posterior processing can
improve performance of error corrections in some cases. The proposed protocol
with single encoding can correct large errors by setting some assumptions. In
contrast, blind mode with single encoding can deal with small errors if
propositions in this paper are not used. The key ideas in posterior processing
are decomposition of errors and computations for comparing EPR pairs of

situation. Research studies lack understanding of human behavior such as
engagement, emotions and social interaction between citizen and police
department on social media. Several social media studies explore and show
technological implications of human behavioral aspects in various contexts such
as workplace interaction and depression in young mothers. In this paper, we
study online interactions between citizens and Indian police in context of
day-to-day policing, including safety concerns, advisories, etc. Indian police
departments use Facebook to issue advisories, send alerts and receive citizen
complaints and suggestions regarding safety issues and day-to-day policing. We
explore how citizens express their emotions and social support on Facebook. Our
work discusses technological implications of behavioral aspects on social well
being of citizens.

  Control using Local Frequency Measurements",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider demand-side primary frequency control in the power grid provided
by smart and flexible loads: loads change consumption to match generation and
help the grid while minimizing disutility for consumers incurred by consumption
changes. The dual formulation of this problem has been solved previously by
Zhao et al. in a decentralized manner for consumer disutilities that are twice
continuously differentiable with respect to consumption changes. In this work,
we propose a decentralized multi-block
alternating-direction-method-of-multipliers (DM-ADMM) algorithm to solve this
problem. In contrast to the dual ascent algorithm of Zhao et al., the proposed
DM-ADMM algorithm does not require the disutilities to be continuously
differentiable; this allows disutility functions that model consumer behavior
that may be quite common. In this work, we prove convergence of the DM-ADMM
algorithm in the deterministic setting (i.e., when loads may estimate the
consumption-generation mismatch from frequency measurements exactly). We test
the performance of the DM-ADMM algorithm in simulations, and we compare (when
applicable) with the previously proposed solution for the dual formulation. We
also present numerical results for a previously proposed ADMM algorithm, whose
results were not previously reported.

modulations at the spin period of the underlying neutron star were clearly
visible, remarkably similar to what is observed during the decaying tail of
magnetar giant flares. We investigated the temporal characteristics of X-ray
emission during the early phases of the outburst. We performed a periodicity
search with the spectral hardness ratio (HR), and found a coherent signal near
the spin period of the neutron star, but with a lag of about 3 radians.
Therefore, the HR is strongly anti-correlated with the X-ray intensity, which
is also seen in the giant flares. We studied time evolution of the pulse
profile and found that it evolves from a complex morphology to a much simpler
shape within about a month. Pulse profile simplification also takes place
during the giant flares, but on a much shorter timescale of about few minutes.
We found that the amount of energy emitted during the first 25 days of the
outburst is comparable to what was detected in minutes during the decaying tail
of giant flares. Based on these similarities, we suggest that the triggering
mechanisms of the giant flares and the magnetar outbursts are likely the same.
We propose that the trapped fireball that develops in the magnetosphere at the
onset of the outburst radiates away efficiently in minutes in magnetars
exhibiting giant flares, while in other magnetars, such as Swift J1822.3--1606,
the efficiency of radiation of the fireball is not as high and, therefore,
lasts much longer.

theoretical predictions from different many-body $T$-matrix theories for a
two-dimensional strongly interacting Fermi gas in the normal state. We find
that the fully self-consistent $T$-matrix theory provides the best description
of the experimental data over a wide range of temperatures and interatomic
interactions. Our comparison reveals the crucial role played by the
interactions between Cooper pairs and suggests that the future development of a
quantitative strong-coupling theory for two-dimensional Fermi superfluids must
explicitly take into account the diagrams that are responsible for pair-pair
interactions.

comparison of lattice QCD results with experiment. In this article, an
extension of the graded symmetry approach to partially quenched QCD is
presented, which builds on previous theory by explicitly including
flavor-singlet baryons in its construction. The formalism takes into account
the interactions among both octet and singlet baryons, octet mesons, and their
ghost counterparts; the latter enables the isolation of the quark-flow
disconnected sea-quark loop contributions. The introduction of the
flavor-singlet states anticipates the application of the method to baryon
excitations such as the lowest-lying odd-parity Lambda baryon, the
Lambda(1405), which is considered in detail as a worked example.

Particularly, the latest observation of pbar/p ratio by AMS02 demonstrated a
flat distribution, which further validated the spectrum anomalies of secondary
particles. All those new phenomena indicated that the conventional propagation
model of cosmic rays meet challenge. In this work, the spatial-dependent
propagation coefficient D(r,z,\rho) is employed by tracing the source
distribution under the physical picture of two-halo model in DRAGON package.
Under such scenario, the model calculation will result in a two-component
spectral for primary nuclei and electron. Simultaneously, due to the smaller
rigidity dependence of D(r,z,\rho) in galactic disk, the ratio of
secondary-to-primary will be inevitablly flatter than the calculation in the
conventional propagation model. As a result, we can reproduce the spectral
hardening of proton, electron and the flat ratio of pbar/p and B/C by only
adopting the spatial-dependent propagation coefficient D(r,z,\rho) in galactic

This paper presents an analytical method to predict the power spectrum and
two-point correlation function of the density-weighted velocity in redshift
space, the direct observables in kSZ surveys. We show a simple relation between
the density power spectrum and the density-weighted velocity power spectrum
that holds for both dark matter and halos. Using this relation, we can then
extend familiar perturbation expansion techniques to the kSZ power spectrum.
One of the most important features of density-weighted velocity statistics in
redshift space is the change in sign of the cross-correlation between the
density and density-weighted velocity at mildly small scales due to nonlinear
redshift space distortions. Our model can explain this characteristic feature
without any free parameters. As a result, our results can precisely predict the
non-linear behavior of the density-weighted velocity field in redshift space up
to $\sim30\ h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$ for dark matter particles at the redshifts of

the parallel dispersion makes the spectra flatter and decelerate the frequency
cascade above the ion-cyclotron frequency. Competition of the above factors
results in spectral indices distributed in the interval [-2,-3], where -2 is
the index of high-frequency space-filling turbulence, and -3 is the index of

We study the first spike latency response as a function of the presynaptic

since f provides a suitable biophysically realistic parameter to control the
level of activity in actual neural systems. We first report on the emergence of
classical NDD behavior as a function of f for the limit of static synapses.
Secondly, we show that when short-term depression and facilitation mechanisms
are included at synapses, different NDD features can be found due to the their
modulatory effect on synaptic current fluctuations. For example a new
intriguing double NDD (DNDD) behavior occurs for different sets of relevant
synaptic parameters. Moreover, depending on the balance between synaptic
depression and synaptic facilitation, single NDD or DNDD can prevails, in such
a way that synaptic facilitation favors the emergence of DNDD whereas synaptic
depression favors the existence of single NDD. This is the first time it has

When accounting for problems in determining surface gravities at low Teff, we

be equivalent to requiring that $u$ maps circles to suitably star-shaped sets.
The convex function $h(s)$ grows logarithmically as $s\to 0+$, linearly as $s
\to +\infty$, and satisfies $h(s)=+\infty$ if $s \leq 0$. These properties
encode a constitutive condition which ensures that material does not
interpenetrate during a deformation and is one of the principal obstacles to
proving the regularity of local or global minimizers. The main innovation is to
prove that if a local minimizer has positive twist a.e\frenchspacing. on a ball
then an Euler-Lagrange type inequality holds and a Caccioppoli inequality can
be derived from it. The claimed H\""{o}lder continuity then follows by adapting
some well-known elliptic regularity theory. We also demonstrate the
regularizing effect that the term $\int_{\om} h(\det \nabla u)\,dx$ can have by
analysing the regularity of local minimizers in the class of `shear maps'. In
this setting a more easily verifiable condition than that of positive twist is
imposed, with the result that local minimizers are H\""{o}lder continuous.

focus on the evaluation of in-medium mass-shift and shift in decay constant of
above vector and axial-vector mesons. In QCD sum rule approach, the properties,
e.g., the masses and decay constants of vector and axial-vector mesons are
written in terms of quark and gluon condensates. These quark and gluon
condensates are evaluated in the present work within chiral SU(3) model,
through the medium modification of, scalar-isoscalar fields $\sigma$ and
$\zeta$, the scalar-isovector field $\delta$ and scalar dilaton field $\chi$,
in the strange hadronic medium which includes both nucleons as well as
hyperons. As we shall see in detail, the masses and decay constants of heavy
vector and axial-vector mesons are affected significantly due to isospin
asymmetry and strangeness fraction of the medium and these modifications may
influence the experimental observables produced in heavy ion collision
experiments. The results of present investigations of in-medium properties of
vector and axial-vector mesons at finite density and temperature of strange
hadronic medium may be helpful for understanding the experimental data from
heavy-ion collision experiments in-particular for the Compressed Baryonic

even though it is discontinuous and cannot predict which measured operator
eigenstate will be observed in which experimental run. The probabilistic Born
rule gives it an ensemble interpretation, predicting proportions of various
outcomes over many experimental runs. Understanding gradual weak measurements
requires replacing this scenario with a dynamical evolution equation for the
collapse of the quantum state in individual experimental runs. We revisit the
quantum trajectory framework that models quantum measurement as a continuous
nonlinear stochastic process. We describe the ensemble of quantum trajectories
as noise fluctuations on top of geodesics that attract the quantum state
towards the measured operator eigenstates. Investigation of the restrictions
needed on the ensemble of quantum trajectories, so as to reproduce projective
measurement in the appropriate limit, shows that the Born rule follows when the
magnitudes of the noise and the attraction are precisely related, in a manner
reminiscent of the fluctuation-dissipation relation. That implies that both the
noise and the attraction have a common origin in the measurement interaction
between the system and the apparatus. We analyse the quantum trajectory
ensemble for the scenarios of quantum diffusion and binary quantum jump, and
show that the ensemble distribution is completely determined in terms of a
single evolution parameter. This trajectory ensemble distribution can be tested
in weak measurement experiments. We also comment on how the required noise may
arise in the measuring apparatus.

researches generally focused on discrimination of EEG of left and right hand

top of the head. However, we choose the gamma wave channels of F7 and F8 and
obtain data when subjects imagine their left or right hand to move with their
eyeballs rotated in the corresponding direction. With the help of the Common
Space Pattern algorithm to extract features of brain waves between left and
right hand movement imagery, we make use of the Support Vector Machine to
classify different brain waves. Traditionally, the accuracy rate of
classification was approximately 90% using the EEG data from C3 and C4
electrode poles; however, the accuracy rate reaches 95.1% by using the gamma
wave data from F7 and F8 in our experiment. Finally, we design a plane program
in Python where a plane can be controlled to go left or right when users
imagine their left or right hand to move. 8 subjects are tested and all of them
can control the plane flexibly which reveals that our model can be applied to

eavesdrop the confidential information transmission. In this regard, we
investigate the problem of secure communication between a source and a

helper to relay the information; however, the source and destination nodes wish
to keep the information confidential from the relay node. To realize the
positive secrecy rate, we use destination-assisted jamming. Being an
energy-starved node, the untrusted relay harvests energy from the received
radio frequency signals, which include the source's information signal and the
destination's jamming signal. Thus, we utilize the jamming signal efficiently
by leveraging it as a useful energy source. At the relay, to enable energy
harvesting and information processing, we adopt power splitting (PS) and time
switching (TS) policies. To evaluate the secrecy performance of this proposed
scenario, we derive analytical expressions for two important metrics, viz., the
secrecy outage probability and the ergodic secrecy rate. The numerical analysis
reveals the design insights into the effects of different system parameters
like power splitting ratio, energy harvesting time, target secrecy rate,
transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), relay location, and energy conversion
efficiency factor, on the secrecy performance. Specifically, the PS policy
achieves better optimal secrecy outage probability and optimal ergodic secrecy
rate than that of the TS policy at higher target secrecy rate and transmit SNR,
respectively.

radiation generated by single-pass cyclotron-resonance masers (CRMs).
Autophasing time --- the time required for the cooperative radiation power to
peak --- is the critical parameter characterizing the dynamics of
electrons-oscillators interacting via the radiation field. Shot-noise related
fluctuations of the autophasing time imposes appreciable limitations on the
possibility of coherent summation of electromagnetic oscillations from several
single-pass CRMs.
  Premodulation of charged particles leads to a considerable narrowing of the
autophasing time distribution function. When the number of particles $N_e$
exceeds a certain value that depends on the degree to which the particles have
been premodulated, the relative root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the
autophasing time $\delta_T$ changes from a logarithmic dependence on $N_e$
($\delta_T\sim1/\ln N_e$) to square-root ($\delta_T\sim1/\sqrt{N_e}$). As a
result, there is an increased probability of coherent summation of

attainable power of cooperative radiation.

nanotubes (SWNTs) an electronic wave packet experiences the typical spatial
diffusion of conventional materials, in metallic SWNTs its shape remains
essentially unaltered up to micron distances at room temperature, even in the
presence of the electron-phonon coupling. Here, by utilizing a Lindblad-based
density-matrix approach enabling us to account for both dissipation and
decoherence effects, we test such prediction by analyzing various aspects that
were so far unexplored. In particular, accounting for initial nonequilibrium
excitations, characterized by an excess energy $E_0$, and including both intra-
and interband phonon scattering, we show that for realistically high values of
$E_0$ the electronic diffusion is extremely small and nearly independent of its
energetic distribution, in spite of a significant energy-dissipation and
decoherence dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effect is robust
with respect to the variation of the chemical potential. Our results thus
suggest that metallic SWNTs are a promising platform to realise quantum
channels for the non-dispersive transmission of electronic wave packets.

voltage dynamics with adaptation and spike emission. We show that these models
can generically display a form of mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs), which are
trajectories featuring an alternation of small oscillations with spikes or
bursts (multiple consecutive spikes). The mechanism by which these are
generated relies fundamentally on the hybrid structure of the flow: invariant
manifolds of the continuous dynamics govern small oscillations, while discrete
resets govern the emission of spikes or bursts, contrasting with classical MMO
mechanisms in ordinary differential equations involving more than three
dimensions and generally relying on a timescale separation. The decomposition
of mechanisms reveals the geometrical origin of MMOs, allowing a relatively
simple classification of points on the reset manifold associated to specific
numbers of small oscillations. We show that the MMO pattern can be described
through the study of orbits of a discrete adaptation map, which is singular as
it features discrete discontinuities with unbounded left- and
right-derivatives. We study orbits of the map via rotation theory for
discontinuous circle maps and elucidate in detail complex behaviors arising in
the case where MMOs display at most one small oscillation between each

take into account residual incoherent coupling between polaron and bath. This
polaronic treatment yields a renormalized inter-band relaxation rate compared

the polaron is tightly dressed in each band and can not tunnel between them,

observed in lattice QCD, suggests that the transition is effectively driven by
the increase of the entropy of bound states. The growth of the entropy with the
inter-quark distance leads to the emergent entropic force that induces
dissociation of quarkonium states. Since the quark-gluon plasma around the
transition point is a strongly coupled system, we use the gauge-gravity duality
to study the entropy of heavy quarkonium and the real-time dynamics of its
dissociation. In particular, we employ the Improved Holographic QCD model as a
dual description of large $N_c$ Yang Mills theory. Studying the dynamics of the
fundamental string between the quarks placed on the boundary, we find that the
entropy peaks at the transition point. We also study the real-time dynamics of
the system by considering the holographic string falling in the black hole
horizon where it equilibrates. In the vicinity the deconfinement transition,
the dissociation time is found to be less than a fermi, suggesting that the
entropic destruction is the dominant dissociation mechanism in this temperature
region.

We determine the randomized coding capacity of both the AVCs under a maximum

show that the capacity is the same even under the average probability of error
criterion. Even with non-causal knowledge of the state, we prove that the

memoryless strategy which depends only on the instantaneous state. Thus, the
AVC capacity characterization is given in terms of the capacity of the worst
memoryless channels with state, induced by the adversary employing such
memoryless jamming strategies. For the DP-AVC, it is further shown that among
memoryless jamming strategies, none impact the communication more than a
memoryless Gaussian jamming strategy which completely disregards the knowledge
of the state. Thus, the capacity of the DP-AVC equals that of a standard AWGN
channel with two independent sources of additive white Gaussian noise, i.e.,

statistical channel power in the joint horizontal and vertical direction. A

the secondary energy efficiency subject to a minimum rate requirement for the
primary user. This leads to challenging non-convex, fractional problems. In the
underlay scenario, we obtain the global solution by means of a suitable
reformulation. In the overlay scenario, two algorithms are proposed. The first
one yields a resource allocation fulfilling the first-order optimality
conditions of the resource allocation problem, by solving a sequence of easier
fractional problems. The second one enjoys a weaker optimality claim, but an
even lower computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the merits
of the proposed algorithms both in terms of energy-efficient performance and
complexity, also showing that the two proposed algorithms for the overlay

originates from the evolution of the magnetic inclination angle $\chi$. The
braking torque under consideration is a combination of the dipole radiation and
the current loss. We find that the evolution of $\chi$ can give rise to extra
cubic and fourth-order polynomial terms in the timing residuals. These two
terms are determined by the efficiency of the dipole radiation, the relative
electric-current density in the pulsar tube and $\chi$. The following
observation facts can be explained with this model: a) young pulsars have
positive $\ddot{\nu}$; b) old pulsars can have both positive and negative
$\ddot{\nu}$; c) the absolute values of $\ddot{\nu}$ are proportional to
$-\dot{\nu}$; d) the absolute values of the braking indices are proportional to
the characteristic ages of pulsars. If the evolution of $\chi$ is purely due to
rotation kinematics, then it can not explain the pulsars with braking index
less than 3, and thus the intrinsic change of the magnetic field is needed in
this case. Comparing the model with observations, we conclude that the drift
direction of $\chi$ might oscillate many times during the lifetime of a pulsar.
The evolution of $\chi$ is not sufficient to explain the rotation behavior of
the Crab pulsar, because the observed $\chi$ and $\dot{\chi}$ are inconsistent
with the values indicated from the timing residuals using this model.

so called Clock Transitions (CT) where experiments have electronic $T_{2e}$

mechanism, this regime is not well understood: the state mixing which underpins
CTs allows also a proliferation of contributions from usually forbidden

magnitude and effects of the corresponding Overhauser fields and other
detunings is not well quantified. For purely magnetic detunings, we identify a

a normalized version of it directly. The ELL method is used for three tasks:
(1) We estimate gender from artificial images of human faces (regression) and
show the advantage of coding additional labels, particularly skin color. (2) We
analyze two existing graphs for regression. (3) We extract compact

specific source and channel noise densities, we obtain the optimal encoding and
estimation policies in conjunction with the optimal transmission schedule. The
impact of the presence of a noisy channel is analyzed numerically based on
dynamic programming. This analysis yields some rather surprising results such
as a phase-transition phenomenon in the number of used transmission
opportunities, which was not encountered in the noiseless communication
setting.

Luttinger Liquid model of one dimensional quantum fluids, arising from
interactions between the elementary phonon excitations. It has been known for
some time, however, that the straightforward inclusion of these interactions
presents technical difficulties that have necessitated approaches based on
refermionization or effective impurity models.
  In this work we show that the nonlinear extensions of the Luttinger model are
tractable in the phonon basis. We present a calculation of the singularities
present in the zero temperature dynamical structure factor in the semiclassical
limit where the phonon dispersion is strong.
  A unitary transformation decouples interactions between left-- and
right--moving phonons, leaving a nonlinear chiral Hamiltonian. At low momenta,
this Hamiltonian has a spectrum bounded above and below by thresholds
identified with phonon and soliton excitations in the semiclassical limit. The
chiral dynamical structure factor therefore has support only in this region,
with power law singularities at the thresholds originating in the Anderson
orthogonality catastrophe, which we calculate analytically. The dynamical
structure factor for the original nonchiral Hamiltonian is a convolution of
this chiral correlator with a power law arising from the left--right
decoupling.

as demand forecasting and climatology. Often, such applications require methods
that are both highly scalable, and deal with noisy data in terms of corruptions
or missing values. Classical time series methods usually fall short of handling
both these issues. In this paper, we propose to adapt matrix matrix completion
approaches that have previously been successfully applied to large scale noisy
data, but which fail to adequately model high-dimensional time series due to
temporal dependencies. We present a novel temporal regularized matrix
factorization (TRMF) framework which supports data-driven temporal dependency
learning and enables forecasting ability to our new matrix factorization
approach. TRMF is highly general, and subsumes many existing matrix
factorization approaches for time series data. We make interesting connections
to graph regularized matrix factorization methods in the context of learning
the dependencies. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show that TRMF
outperforms several existing approaches for common time series tasks.

Dirichlet-Neumann operator that relates the longitudinal electric field to the
tangential magnetic field on the boundary of a conductor. We demonstrate how
the surface operator can be obtained through the contour integral method for
conductors of arbitrary shape. The proposed algorithm is simple to implement,
efficient, and can handle arbitrary cross-sections, which is a main advantage
over the existing approach based on eigenfunctions, which is available only for
canonical conductor's shapes. The versatility of the method is illustrated
through a diverse set of examples, which includes transmission lines with
trapezoidal, curved, and V-shaped conductors. Numerical results demonstrate the
accuracy, versatility, and efficiency of the proposed technique.

cope with the high speed (>1kHz), high accuracy and high order requirements for
future extremely large telescopes. An innovative high order adaptive optics
system using a self-referenced Mach-Zehnder wavefront sensor (MZWFS) allows
counteracting these limitations. This sensor estimates very accurately the
wavefront phase at small spatial scale by measuring intensity differences
between two outputs, with a $\lambda /4$ path length difference between its two
legs, but is limited in dynamic range due to phase ambiguity. During the past
few years, such an XAO system has been studied by our team in the framework of
8-meter class telescopes. In this work, we report on our latest results with
the XAO testbed recently installed in our lab, and dedicated to high contrast
imaging with 30m-class telescopes (such as the E-ELT or the TMT). After
reminding the principle of a MZWFS and describing the optical layout of our
experiment, we will show the results of the assessment of the woofer-tweeter
phase correctors, i.e., a Boston Micromachine continuous membrane deformable
mirror (DM) and a Boulder Nonlinear Systems liquid crystal spatial light
modulator (SLM). In particular, we will detail the calibration of the DM using
Zygo interferometer metrology. Our method consists in the precise measurement
of the membrane deformation while applying a constant deformation to 9 out of
140 actuators at the same time. By varying the poke voltage across the DM
operating range, we propose a simple but efficient way of modeling the DM
influence function using a Gaussian model. Finally, we show the DM flattening
on the MZWFS allowing to compensate for low order aberrations.

all of which are visible on MRI. Here we characterize the lesion formation
process on longitudinal, multi-sequence structural MRI from 34 MS patients and
relate the longitudinal changes we observe within lesions to therapeutic
interventions. In this article, we first outline a pipeline to extract voxel
level, multi-sequence longitudinal profiles from four MRI sequences within
lesion tissue. We then propose two models to relate clinical covariates to the
longitudinal profiles. The first model is a principal component analysis (PCA)
regression model, which collapses the information from all four profiles into a
scalar value. We find that the score on the first PC identifies areas of slow,
long-term intensity changes within the lesion at a voxel level, as validated by
two experienced clinicians, a neuroradiologist and a neurologist. On a quality
scale of 1 to 4 (4 being the highest) the neuroradiologist gave the score on
the first PC a median rating of 4 (95% CI: [4,4]), and the neurologist gave it
a median rating of 3 (95% CI: [3,3]). In the PCA regression model, we find that
treatment with disease modifying therapies (p-value < 0.01), steroids (p-value
< 0.01), and being closer to the boundary of abnormal signal intensity (p-value
< 0.01) are associated with a return of a voxel to intensity values closer to
that of normal-appearing tissue. The second model is a function-on-scalar
regression, which allows for assessment of the individual time points at which
the covariates are associated with the profiles. In the function-on-scalar
regression both age and distance to the boundary were found to have a
statistically significant association with the profiles.

widely used ""preprocessing"" step in many learning tasks, typically leading to
dimensionality reduction by projecting onto a number of dominant singular
vectors and rescaling the coordinate axes (by a predefined function of the
singular value). However, the number of such vectors required to capture
problem structure grows with problem size, and even partial SVD computation
becomes a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity it compressive
spectral embedding algorithm, which employs random projections and finite order
polynomial expansions to compute approximations to SVD-based embedding. For an
m times n matrix with T non-zeros, its time complexity is O((T+m+n)log(m+n)),
and the embedding dimension is O(log(m+n)), both of which are independent of
the number of singular vectors whose effect we wish to capture. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work to circumvent this dependence on the
number of singular vectors for general SVD-based embeddings. The key to
sidestepping the SVD is the observation that, for downstream inference tasks
such as clustering and classification, we are only interested in using the
resulting embedding to evaluate pairwise similarity metrics derived from the
euclidean norm, rather than capturing the effect of the underlying matrix on
arbitrary vectors as a partial SVD tries to do. Our numerical results on
network datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, and motivate
further exploration of its application to large-scale inference tasks.

To do this Andrieu et al. (2010) constructed a Markov kernel which leaves this
conditional distribution invariant using a Particle Filter. From a
practitioner's point of view, this Markov kernel attempts to mimic the act of
sampling all the latent state variables as one block from the posterior

some recent theoretical results that establish the uniform ergodicity of this

particles grows at least linearly with the number of latent states in the
posterior. This gives rise to a cost, per application of the kernel, that is
quadratic in the number of latent states which could be prohibitive for long
observation sequences. We seek to answer an obvious but important question: is
there a different implementation with a cost per-iteration that grows linearly
with the number of latent states, but which is still stable in the sense that
its mixing rate does not deteriorate? We address this problem using blocking

angular resolutions of 16.3"", 16.3"", and 11.9"", respectively. We present the CO

in the redshifted wings to shock models. The two triplets near 163 microns are
detected in emission with blending hyperfine structure unresolved. Their
profiles and that of CO can be fitted by a combination of 2 or 3 Gaussians. The
observed 119.2 microns triplet is seen in absorption, since its blending
hyperfine structure is unresolved, but with three line-of-sight components and
a blueshifted emission wing consistent with that of the other lines. The OH
line wings are similar to those of CO, suggesting that they emanate from the
same shocked structure. Under this common origin assumption, the observations
fall within the model predictions and within the range of use of our model only
if we consider that four shock structures are caught in our beam. Our
comparisons suggest that the observations might be consistently fitted by a
J-type model with nH > 1e5 cm-3, v > 20 km/s, and with a filling factor of ~1.
Such a high density is generally found in shocks associated to high-mass

the interplay of two processes: the dynamics of the network, whose structure
changes over time according to the encounters between individuals, and the
dynamics on the network, whose nodes can infect each other after an encounter.
Physical encounter is the most common vehicle for the spread of infectious
diseases, but detailed information about encounters is often unavailable
because expensive, unpractical to collect or privacy sensitive. We asks whether
the friendship ties between the individuals in a social network successfully
predict who is at risk. Using a dataset from a popular online review service,
we build a time-varying network that is a proxy of physical encounter between
users and a static network based on reported friendship. Through computer
simulations, we compare infection processes on the resulting networks and show
that, whereas distance on the friendship network is correlated to epidemic
risk, friendship provides a poor identification of the individuals at risk if
the infection is driven by physical encounter. Such limit is not due to the
randomness of the infection, but to the structural differences of the two
networks. In contrast to the macroscopic similarity between processes spreading
on different networks, the differences in local connectivity determined by the
two definitions of edges result in striking differences between the dynamics at
a microscopic level. Despite the limits highlighted, we show that periodical
and relatively infrequent monitoring of the real infection on the encounter
network allows to correct the predicted infection on the friendship network and
to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy. In addition, the friendship
network contains valuable information to effectively contain epidemic outbreaks
when a limited budget is available for immunization.

coordination/organization of nodes gives rise to emergence of power law in
degree distributions of several real networks, the networks in the proposed
model are generated by the virtue of self coordination of nodes in corona
graphs. Alike real networks, the SCCG inherit motifs which act as the seed
graphs for the generation of SCCG. We also analytically prove that the power
law exponent of SCCG is approximately $2$ and the diameter of SCCG produced by
a class of motifs is constant. Finally, we compare different properties of the
proposed model with that of the BA and Pseudofractal scale-free models for
complex networks.

(VNS) which integrates the basic VNS with other complementary approaches from
machine learning, statistics and experimental algorithmic, in order to produce
high-quality performance and to completely automate the resulting optimization
strategy. The resulting intelligent VNS has been successfully applied to a
couple of optimization problems where the solution space consists of the
subsets of a finite reference set. These problems are the labelled spanning
tree and forest problems that are formulated on an undirected labelled graph; a
graph where each edge has a label in a finite set of labels L. The problems
consist on selecting the subset of labels such that the subgraph generated by
these labels has an optimal spanning tree or forest, respectively. These
problems have several applications in the real-world, where one aims to ensure
connectivity by means of homogeneous connections.

proposed to calculate phononic band structure of reticulated honeycomb lattices
having translationally invariant repetitive elements called unit cells. Bloch
formulation captures dynamics of infinite structure through that of a unit
cell. While conventional FEM is generally used for analyzing dynamics of such
unit systems, here, constituent structural members are treated as 1D waveguide
and modeled as Timoshenko beam frame element, enabling application of spectral
FEM, suitable for accurately analyzing the dynamics, particularly efficient at
very high frequencies. Using exact solutions as shape functions spares dense
meshing. Resulting eigenvalue problem is solved by Wittrick-Williams method, an
iterative scheme. Subsequently, band structures are obtained for supercells-
units comprising multiple elemental unit cells; compared and reconciled with
those obtained using elemental cell (termed primitive unit cell to distinguish
from supercell). Primitive cell band structures are reconstructed from
Supercell band structures. Supercell band structures show some spurious bands,
which are explained in terms of band folding in the primitive cell band
structure. Supercell allows treatment of defects as a periodic feature with
certain defect density. Of particular observation in such band structures is
the separation of bands, known as degeneracy breaking.

theory is essential for a successful realization of the inflationary scenario,
with very reasonable parameter values. The inflationary models thus obtained
are seen to be in good agreement with the most recent and accurate

fluids in average and their intrinsic isotropy have made these models very
fruitful in cosmology. In this work we will analyse the perturbations dynamics
in these theories assuming general power law potentials $V(\phi)=\lambda
\vert\phi\vert^{n}/n$. At leading order in the wavenumber expansion, a simple
expression for the effective sound speed of perturbations is obtained
$c_{\text{eff}}^2 = \omega=(n-2)/(n+2)$ with $\omega$ the effective equation of
state. We also obtain the first order correction in
$k^2/\omega_{\text{eff}}^2$, when the wavenumber $k$ of the perturbations is
much smaller than the background oscillation frequency, $\omega_{\text{eff}}$.
For the standard massive case we have also analysed general anharmonic
contributions to the effective sound speed. These results are reached through a
perturbed version of the generalized virial theorem and also studying the exact
system both in the super-Hubble limit, deriving the natural ansatz for
$\delta\phi$; and for sub-Hubble modes, exploiting Floquet's theorem.

Discretization of such inputs is done to capture saliences, represented as

sequences are used to reason over complex scenarios, a more compact
representation would aid exactness of technical cognitive reasoning
capabilities, which are today constrained by computational complexity issues
and fallback to representational heuristics or human intervention. Such
problems need to be addressed to ensure timely and meaningful human-robot

informativeness when training on subsets of a given input dataset. This is in
view of reducing the training size while retaining the majority of the symbolic
