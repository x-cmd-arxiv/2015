relocalization system. We use a Bayesian convolutional neural network to
regress the 6-DOF camera pose from a single RGB image. It is trained in an
end-to-end manner with no need of additional engineering or graph optimisation.
The algorithm can operate indoors and outdoors in real time, taking under 6ms
to compute. It obtains approximately 2m and 6 degrees accuracy for very large
scale outdoor scenes and 0.5m and 10 degrees accuracy indoors. Using a Bayesian
convolutional neural network implementation we obtain an estimate of the
model's relocalization uncertainty and improve state of the art localization
accuracy on a large scale outdoor dataset. We leverage the uncertainty measure
to estimate metric relocalization error and to detect the presence or absence
of the scene in the input image. We show that the model's uncertainty is caused
by images being dissimilar to the training dataset in either pose or
appearance.

starts at large scales and works inwards. In line with recent analytical work,
we find that the density evolves to a fixed attractor, $\rho(r,t ) \rightarrow
\rho(r)$, for $r_d<r<r_*$; mass flows through this structure onto a
sporadically gravitationally unstable disk, and from thence onto the star. In
the bulk of the simulation box we find that the random motions $v_T \sim r^p$
with $p \sim 0.5$, in agreement with Larson's size-linewidth relation. In the
vicinity of massive star forming regions we find $ p \sim 0.2-0.3$, as seen in
observations. For $r<r_*$, $v_T$ increases inward, with $p=-1/2$. Finally, we
find that the total stellar mass $M_*(t)\sim t^2$ in line with previous
numerical and analytic work that suggests a nonlinear rate of star formation.

equivalent, but in many aspects simpler description of fermions by first
reformulating their first-order (Dirac) Lagrangian in terms of two-component
spinors, and then integrating out the spinors of one chirality ($e.g.$ primed
or dotted). The resulting new Lagrangian is second-order in derivatives, and
contains two-component spinors of only one chirality. The new second-order
formulation simplifies the fermion Feynman rules of the theory considerably,
$e.g.$ the propagator becomes a multiple of an identity matrix in the field
space. The aim of this thesis is to work out the details of this formulation
for theories such as Quantum Electrodynamics, and the Standard Model of
elementary particles. After having developed the tools necessary to establish
the second-order formalism as an equivalent approach to spinor field theories,
we proceed with some important consistency checks that the new formulation is
required to pass, namely the presence or absence of anomalies in their
perturbative and non-perturbative description, and the unitarity of the
S-Matrix derived from their Lagrangian. Another aspect which is studied is
unification, where we seek novel gauge-groups that can be used to embed all of
the Standard Model content: forces and fermionic representations. Finally, we
will explore the possibility to unify gravity and the Standard Model when the
former is seen as a diffeomorphism invariant gauge-theory.

assume symmetry such that the magnetic null point when present is co-located
with a flow stagnation point, the introduction of asymmetry typically leads to
non-ideal flows across the null point. To understand this behavior, we present
exact expressions for the motion of three-dimensional linear null points. The
most general expression shows that linear null points move in the direction
along which the vector field and its time derivative are antiparallel. Null
point motion in resistive magnetohydrodynamics results from advection by the
bulk plasma flow and resistive diffusion of the magnetic field, which allows
non-ideal flows across topological boundaries. Null point motion is described
intrinsically by parameters evaluated locally; however, global dynamics help
set the local conditions at the null point. During a bifurcation of a
degenerate null point into a null-null pair or the reverse, the instantaneous
velocity of separation or convergence of the null-null pair will typically be
infinite along the null space of the Jacobian matrix of the magnetic field, but
with finite components in the directions orthogonal to the null space. Not all
bifurcating null-null pairs are connected by a separator. Furthermore, except
under special circumstances, there will not exist a straight line separator
connecting a bifurcating null-null pair. The motion of separators cannot be
described using solely local parameters, because the identification of a
particular field line as a separator may change as a result of non-ideal
behavior elsewhere along the field line.

exists on experimental and modelling studies of trees during the growing season
when large negative stem pressures are generated by transpiration from leaves.
Much less attention has been paid to winter months when trees are largely
dormant but nonetheless continue to exhibit interesting flow behaviour. A prime
example is sap exudation, which refers to the peculiar ability of sugar maple
(Acer saccharum) and related species to generate positive stem pressure while
in a leafless state. Experiments demonstrate that ambient temperatures must
oscillate about the freezing point before significantly heightened stem
pressures are observed, but the precise causes of exudation remain unresolved.
The prevailing hypothesis attributes exudation to a physical process combining
freeze-thaw and osmosis, which has some support from experimental studies but
remains a subject of active debate. We address this knowledge gap by developing
the first mathematical model for exudation, while also introducing several
essential modifications to this hypothesis. We derive a multiscale model
consisting of a nonlinear system of differential equations governing phase
change and transport within wood cells, coupled to a suitably homogenized
equation for temperature on the macroscale. Numerical simulations yield stem
pressures that are consistent with experiments and provide convincing evidence
that a purely physical mechanism is capable of capturing exudation.

$\rho\approx0.4$ or greater for $\ell<20$ and $f_{\mathrm{sky}}\geq0.5$,

with dust, synchrotron, and their correlation fits well to all possible cross
spectra formed with the WMAP and Planck 353 GHz data given the current
uncertainties. (3) In the 50$\%$ cleanest region of the polarized dust map, the
ratio of synchrotron to dust amplitudes at 90 GHz for 50 $\leq \ell \leq$110 is
$0.3_{-0.2}^{+0.3}$. Smaller regions of sky can be cleaner although the
uncertainties in our knowledge of synchrotron emission are larger. A
high-sensitivity measurement of synchrotron below 90 GHz will be important for

adaptability. However, control of modular, multi-limbed soft robots for
terrestrial locomotion is challenging due to the complex robot structure,
actuator mechanics and robot-environment interaction. Traditionally, soft robot
control is performed by modeling kinematics using exact geometric equations and
finite element analysis. The research presents an alternative, model-free,
data-driven, reinforcement learning inspired approach, for controlling
multi-limbed soft material robots. This control approach can be summarized as a
four-step process of discretization, visualization, learning and optimization.
The first step involves identification and subsequent discretization of key
factors that dominate robot-environment, in turn, the robot control. Graph
theory is used to visualize relationships and transitions between the
discretized states. The graph representation facilitates mathematical
definition of periodic control patterns (simple cycles) and locomotion gaits.
Rewards corresponding to individual arcs of the graph are weighted displacement
and orientation change for robot state-to-state transitions. These rewards are
specific to surface of locomotion and are learned. Finally, the control
patterns result from optimization of reward dependent locomotion task (e.g.
translation) cost function. The optimization problem is an Integer Linear
Programming problem which can be quickly solved using standard solvers. The
framework is generic and independent of type of actuator, soft material
properties or the type of friction mechanism, as the control exists in the
robot's task space. Furthermore, the data-driven nature of the framework
imparts adaptability to the framework toward different locomotion surfaces by
re-learning rewards.

Crouch (Solar Physics, 282, 107, 2013), all methods used an expression for the
divergence of the magnetic field that involves differentiation of quantities
that depend on the choice of azimuthal angle. As a result, all heights used to
approximate line-of-sight derivatives should generally be disambiguated
simultaneously. In this article, we investigate a set of methods that use an
expression for the divergence that involves differentiation of quantities that
do not depend on the choice of azimuthal angle. This results in an expression
for the divergence that can be used to disambiguate each height independently.
We test two methods using synthetic and find that the two-step, hybrid method,
adapted to disambiguate each height independently, generally produces
reasonable results. Moreover, the time required to compute solutions is
substantially decreased in comparison to the corresponding method that
disambiguates all relevant heights simultaneously.

such assets existed, they would provide trivially profitable investment
strategies for any investor able to trade them, thanks to the knowledge that
such assets oscillate predictably around their long term mean. The modus
operandi of cointegration-based trading strategies [Tsay, 2005, {\S}8] is to
create first a portfolio of assets whose aggregate value mean-reverts, to
exploit that knowledge by selling short or buying that portfolio when its value
deviates from its long-term mean. Such portfolios are typically selected using
tools from cointegration theory [Engle and Granger, 1987, Johansen, 1991],
whose aim is to detect combinations of assets that are stationary, and
therefore mean-reverting. We argue in this work that focusing on stationarity
only may not suffice to ensure profitability of cointegration-based strategies.
While it might be possible to create syn- thetically, using a large array of
financial assets, a portfolio whose aggre- gate value is stationary and
therefore mean-reverting, trading such a large portfolio incurs in practice
important trade or borrow costs. Looking for stationary portfolios formed by
many assets may also result in portfolios that have a very small volatility and
which require significant leverage to be profitable. We study in this work
algorithmic approaches that can take mitigate these effects by searching for
maximally mean-reverting portfo- lios which are sufficiently sparse and/or
volatile.

properly tailoring orientational misalignment between zigzag graphene and

that if minimization is extended to all bases related through a Bogoliubov

Lorentz-diffeomorphism covariant theories. In this paper we firstly introduce
the total variation of a quantity due to an infinitesimal
Lorentz-diffeomorphism transformation. Secondly, in order to obtain the
conserved charges of Lorentz-diffeomorphism non-covariant theories, we extend
the Tachikawa method \cite{3}. This extension includes not only Lorentz gauge
transformation but also the diffeomorphism. We apply this method to the
Chern-Simons-like theories of gravity (CSLTG) and obtain a general formula for
the entropy of black holes in those theories. Finally, some examples on CSLTG
are provided and the entropy of the BTZ black hole is calculated in the context

we derive a criterion to determine when a translationally invariant Matrix
Product State (MPS) has long range localizable entanglement, which indicates
that the corresponding state has some kind of non-local hidden order. We give
examples fulfilling this criterion and eventually use it to obtain all such MPS
with bond dimension 2 and 3. In the second part, we show that Projected
Entangled Pair States (PEPS) in two spatial dimensions can describe chiral
topological states by explicitly constructing a family of such states with a
non-trivial Chern number. We demonstrate that such free fermionic PEPS must
necessarily be non-injective and have gapless parent Hamiltonians. Moreover, we
provide numerical evidence that they can nevertheless approximate well the
physical properties of Chern insulators with local Hamiltonians at arbitrary
temperatures. We also construct long range, topological Hamiltonians with a
flat energy spectrum for which those PEPS are unique ground states. As for
non-chiral topological PEPS, the non-trivial, topological properties can be
traced down to the existence of a symmetry on the virtual level of the PEPS
tensor that is used to build the state. We use the special properties of PEPS
to build the boundary theory and show how the symmetry results in the
appearance of chiral modes, a ground state degeneracy of the parent Hamiltonian
on the torus and a universal correction to the area law for the zero R\'enyi
entropy. Finally, we show that PEPS can also describe chiral topologically
ordered phases. For that, we construct a simple PEPS for spin-1/2 particles in

rise to the global topological character. We also extract characteristic

SnS$_\mathrm{2}$ exhibit a reversible semiconductor to metal transition (S-M)
at strain values of 0.17, $-$0.26, and $-$0.24 under BT, BC, and NC strains,

required to achieve S-M transition in SnS$_\text{2}$ under NC strain is much
higher than for MoS$_\mathrm{2}$. The S-M transition for BT, BC, and NC strains
is caused by the interaction between the S-$p_z$ and Sn-$s$, S-$p_x$/$p_y$ and

and the wavelength of the maximum polarization $\lambda_{\max}$ observed for 17
objects (including 243 stars) separated into two groups: ""dark clouds"" and
""open clusters"". The objects are assigned to one of the groups according to the
distribution of the parameter $\lambda_{\max}$. We use the model of homogeneous
silicate and carbonaceous spheroidal particles with the imperfect alignment and
a time-evolving size distribution. The polarization is assumed to be mainly
produced by large silicate particles with the sizes $r_{V} \ga r_{V,\rm cut}$.
The models with the initial size distribution reproducing the average curve of
the interstellar extinction fail to explain the values of $\lambda_{\max} \ga
0.65\,\mkm$ observed for several dark clouds. We assume that the grain size
distribution is modified due to accretion and coagulation, according to the
model of Hirashita \& Voshchinnikov (2014). After including the evolutionary
effects, $\lambda_{\max}$ shifts to longer wavelengths on time-scales $\sim 20
(n_\mathrm{H}/10^3 \mathrm{cm}^{-3})^{-1}$ Myr where $n_\mathrm{H}$ is the
hydrogen density in molecular clouds where dust processing occurs. The ratio
$P_{\max}/E(B-V)$ goes down dramatically when the size of polarizing grains
grows. The variations of the degree and direction of particle orientation
influence this ratio only moderately. We have also found that the aspect ratio
of prolate grains does not affect significantly the polarizing efficiency. For
oblate particles, the shape effect is stronger but in most cases the
polarization curves produced are too narrow in comparison with the observed
ones.

of stellar origin. Although the SED is bright at UV wavelengths, there is no
strong evidence that the late-time luminosity originates solely from a stellar
source corresponding to the binary companion, although a partial contribution
to the observed UV flux from a companion star can not be ruled out.

  Boundary Damping",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dynamics of a (nonlinear) Berger plate in the absence of rotational
inertia are considered with inhomogenous boundary conditions. In our analysis,
we consider boundary damping in two scenarios: (i) free plate boundary
conditions, or (ii) hinged-type boundary conditions. In either situation, the
nonlinearity gives rise to complicating boundary terms. In the case of free
boundary conditions we show that well-posedness of finite-energy solutions can
be obtained via highly non- linear boundary dissipation. Additionally, we show
the existence of a compact global attractor for the dynamics in the presence of
hinged-type boundary dissipation (assuming a geometric condition on the entire
boundary [22]). To obtain the existence of the attractor we explicitly
construct the absorbing set for the dynamics by employing energy methods that:
(i) exploit the structure of the Berger nonlinearity, and (ii) utilize sharp
trace results for the Euler-Bernoulli plate in [24].
  We provide a parallel commentary (from a mathematical point of view) to the
discussion of modeling with Berger versus von Karman nonlinearities: to wit, we
describe the derivation of each nonlinear dynamics and a discussion of the
validity of the Berger approximation. We believe this discussion to be of broad
value across engineering and applied mathematics communities.

which becomes increasingly precarious as the buckling load is approached. So to
induce premature buckling a lateral disturbance will have to overcome a
decreasing energy barrier which reaches zero at buckling. Two archetypal
problems that exhibit a severe form of this behaviour are the
axially-compressed cylindrical shell and the externally pressurized spherical
shell. Focussing on the cylinder, a non-destructive technique was recently
proposed to estimate the 'shock sensitivity' of a laboratory specimen using a
lateral probe to measure the nonlinear load-deflection characteristic. If a
symmetry-breaking bifurcation is encountered on the path, computer simulations
showed how this can be suppressed by a controlled secondary probe. Here, we
extend our understanding by assessing in general terms how a single control can
capture remote saddle solutions: in particular how a symmetric probe could
locate an asymmetric solution. Then, more specifically, we analyse the
spherical shell with point and ring probes, to test the procedure under
challenging conditions to assess its range of applicability. Rather than a
bifurcation, the spherical shell offers the challenge of a de-stabilizing fold
(limit point) under the rigid control of the probe.

employs the shortest paths protocol to determine the logical paths for packets
transmission, while the lower subnetwork acts as the physical layer, in which
packets are delivered by the biased random walk mechanism characterized with a
parameter $\alpha$. Through simulation, we obtain the optimal $\alpha$
corresponding to the maximum network lifetime and the maximum number of the
arrival packets. Assortative coupling is better than the random coupling and
the disassortative coupling, since it achieves much better transmission
performances. Generally, the more homogeneous the lower subnetwork, the better
the transmission performances are, which is opposite for the upper subnetwork.
Finally, we propose an attack centrality for nodes based on the topological
information of both subnetworks, and further investigate the transmission
performances under targeted attacks. Our work helps to understand the spreading
and robustness issues of multiplex networks and provides some clues about the
designing of more efficient and robust routing architectures in communication
