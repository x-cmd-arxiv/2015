photonic circuits is the lack of ultracompact, high speed, broadband
electro-optical (EO) modulators, which up-convert electronic signals into high
bit-rate photonic data. In addition to direct modulation of lasers, EO
modulators can be classified into (i) phase modulation based on EO effect or
free-carrier injection, or (ii) absorption modulation based on Franz-Keldysh
effect or quantum-confined Stark effect. Due to the poor EO properties of
regular materials, a conventional EO modulator has a very large footprint.
Based on high-Q resonators, recent efforts have advanced EO modulators into
microscale footprints, which have nearly reached their physical limits
restricted by the materials. On-chip optical interconnects require ultrafast EO
modulators at the nanoscale. The technical barrier may not be well overcome
based on conventional approaches and well-known materials. Herein, we report an
EO modulator, more specifically electro-absorption (EA) modulator, based on the
integration of a novel yet inexpensive active material, indium tin oxide (ITO),
in a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) plasmonic waveguide platform, where the field
effect is then greatly enhanced by high-k insulator and double capacitor gating
scheme. The modulator waveguide length is only 800 nm, which is the smallest
recorded dimension according to our knowledge. Preliminary results show that it
has extinction ratio of 1.75 (2.43 dB) at 10 MHz, works up to 500 MHz (limited
by testing setup for now), and can potentially operate at high speed.

initial result reported here is extracted from the commissioning part of the
experiment, constituting about 4% of the full data set. The parity-violating
asymmetry at a low momentum transfer $Q^2$=0.025 GeV$^2$ is $A_{ep}$ = -279
$\pm$ 35 (stat) $\pm$ 31 (syst) ppb, which is the smallest and most precise
asymmetry ever measured in $\vec{e}$p scattering. This result allowed the first
determination of the weak charge of the proton $Q_W^p$ from a global fit of
parity-violating elastic scattering (PVES) results from nuclear targets, where
earlier data at higher $Q^2$ constrain uncertainties of hadronic structure. The
value extracted from the global fit is $Q_W^p$ (PVES) = 0.064 $\pm$ 0.012, in
agreement with the standard model prediction $Q_W^p$ (SM) = 0.0710 $\pm$
0.0007. The neutral weak charges of up and down quarks are extracted from a
combined fit of the PVES results with a previous atomic parity violation (APV)
measurement on $^{133}$Cs. The analysis of the full $Q_{weak}$ data is ongoing
and expected to yield a value for the asymmetry within 10 ppb of precision.
  Because of the suppression of $Q_W^p$, such a high precision measurement will
place significant constraints to models of physics beyond the standard model.

break-up of current sheets into magnetic islands, with reconnection rates that
become independent of Lundquist number, challenging the belief that fast
magnetic reconnection in flares proceeds via the Petschek mechanism that
invokes pairs of slow-mode shocks connected to a compact diffusion region. The
reconnection sites are too small to be resolved with images but these
reconnection mechanisms, Petschek and the plasmoid instability, have
reconnection sites with very different density and velocity structures and so
can be distinguished by high-resolution line-profiles observations. Using IRIS
spectroscopic observations we obtain a survey of typical line profiles produced
by small-scale events thought to be reconnection sites on the Sun. Slit-jaw
images are used to investigate the plasma heating and re-configuration at the
sites. A sample of 15 events from two active regions is presented. The line
profiles are complex with bright cores and broad wings extending to over 300
km/s. The profiles can be reproduced with the multiple magnetic islands and
acceleration sites that characterise the plasmoid instability but not by
bi-directional jets that characterise the Petschek mechanism. This result
suggests that if these small-scale events are reconnection sites, then fast
reconnection proceeds via the plasmoid instability, rather than the Petschek
mechanism during small-scale reconnection on the Sun.

generalization we consider is to retain GUT-scale universality for the squark

supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the masses of the Higgs doublets. As
with other CMSSM-like models, the measured Higgs mass requires supersymmetric
particle masses near or beyond the TeV scale. Because of these rather heavy
sparticle masses, the embedding of these CMSSM-like models in a minimal SU(5)
model of grand unification can yield a proton lifetime consistent with current
experimental limits, and may be accessible in existing and future proton decay
experiments. Another possible signature of these CMSSM-like models is direct
detection of supersymmetric dark matter. The direct dark matter scattering rate
is typically below the reach of the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment if $M_{in}$ is
close to $M_{GUT}$, but may lie within its reach if $M_{in} \lesssim 10^{11}$
GeV. Likewise, generalizing the CMSSM to allow non-universal
supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the Higgs offers extensive
possibilities for models within reach of the LZ experiment that have long
proton lifetimes.

laser pulses to image density gradients in a rapidly evolving plasma. It
enables structures that move at speeds close to the speed of light, such as
laser driven wakes, to be visualized. Here we study the process of
shadowgraphic image formation during the propagation of a few cycle probe pulse
transversely through a laser-driven wake using three-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations. In order to construct synthetic shadowgrams a
near-field snapshot of the ultrashort probe pulse is analyzed by means of
Fourier optics, taking into account the effect of a typical imaging setup. By
comparing synthetic and experimental shadowgrams we show that the generation of
synthetic data is crucial for the correct interpretation of experiments.
Moreover, we study the dependence of synthetic shadowgrams on various
parameters such as the imaging system aperture, the position of the object
plane and the probe pulse delay, duration and wavelength. Finally, we show that
time-dependent information from the interaction can be recovered from a single
shot by using a broadband, chirped probe pulse and subsequent spectral
filtering.

large scale motion of a magnetized conducting fluid. Our consideration is
motivated by the problem of heating the solar corona, which is believed to be
governed by fast reconnection events set off by the slow motion of magnetic
field lines anchored in the photospheric plasma. To elucidate the physics
governing the disruption of the imposed laminar motion and the energy transfer
to small scales, we propose a simplified model where the large-scale motion of
magnetic field lines is prescribed not at the footpoints but rather imposed
volumetrically. As a result, the problem can be treated numerically with an
efficient, highly-accurate spectral method, allowing us to use a resolution and
statistical ensemble exceeding those of the previous work. We find that, even
though the large-scale deformations are slow, they eventually lead to
reconnection events that drive a turbulent state at smaller scales. The
small-scale turbulence displays many of the universal features of field-guided
MHD turbulence like a well developed inertial range spectrum. Based on these
observations, we construct a phenomenological model that gives the scalings of
the amplitude of the fluctuations and the energy dissipation rate as functions
of the input parameters. We find a good agreement between the numerical results
and the predictions of the model.

grafting densities from essentially isolated chains to dense brushes. The
end-grafted polymers were described by a bead spring model with an harmonic
potential to include the bond stiffness of the chains. We varied the rigidity
of the chains, from fully flexible polymers to rigid rods, in which the
configurational entropy of the chains is negligible. The brush-liquid
interaction was tuned to obtain a super-hydrophobic channel, in which the
liquid did not penetrate the polymer brush, giving rise to a Cassie-Baxter
state. Equilibrium properties such us brush height and bending energy were
measured, varying the grafting density and the stiffness of the polymers. We
studied also the characteristics of the brush-liquid interface and the
morphology of the polymers chains supporting the liquid for different bending
rigidities. Non-equilibrium simulations were performed, moving the walls of the
channel in opposite directions at constant speed, obtaining a Couette velocity
profile in the bulk liquid. The molecular degrees of freedom of the polymers
were studied as a function of the Weissenberg number. Also, the violation of
the no-slip boundary condition and the slip properties were analyzed as a
function of the shear rate, grafting density and bending stiffness. At high
grafting densities, a finite slip length independent of the shear rate or
bending constant was found, while at low grafting densities a very interesting
non-monotonic behaviour on the bending constant is observed.

many thousands of galactic binaries should be individually resolved. However,
the identification of the sources, and the extraction of the signal parameters

stochastic searches have proven to be the most successful for this problem. In
this work we present the first application of a swarm-based algorithm combining
Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution. These algorithms have
been shown to converge faster to global solutions on complicated likelihood
surfaces than other stochastic methods. We first demonstrate the effectiveness
of the algorithm for the case of a single binary in a 1 mHz search bandwidth.
This interesting problem gave the algorithm plenty of opportunity to fail, as
it can be easier to find a strong noise peak rather than the signal itself.
After a successful detection of a fictitious low-frequency source, as well as
the verification binary RXJ0806.3+1527, we then applied the algorithm to the
detection of multiple binaries, over different search bandwidths, in the cases
of low and mild source confusion. In all cases, we show that we can

Carlo (SMC) sampling framework. In this framework, the objective function is
normalized to be a probabilistic density function (pdf), based on which a
sequence of annealed target pdfs is designed to asymptotically converge on the
set of global optima. A sequential importance sampling (SIS) procedure is
performed to simulate the resulting targets, and the maxima of the objective
function is assessed from the yielded samples. The disturbing issue lies in the
design of the importance sampling (IS) pdf, which crucially influences the IS
efficiency. We propose an approach to design the IS pdf online by embedding a
posterior exploration (PE) procedure into each iteration of the SMC framework.
The PE procedure can also explore the important regions of the parameter space
supported by the target pdf. A byproduct of the PE procedure is an adaptive
mechanism to design the annealing temperature schedule online. We compare the
performance of the proposed algorithm with those of several existing related
alternatives by applying them to over a dozen standard benchmark functions. The
result demonstrates the appealing properties of our algorithm.

drastically enhance local electromagnetic fields, and thereby increase the
efficiency of nonlinear optical phenomena, such as second harmonic generation
(SHG). While it has been experimentally observed that enhanced fields can
significantly boost SHG, to date it proved difficult to probe electrical and
magnetic resonances in one and the same nanostructure. This however is
necessary to directly compare relative contributions of electrical and magnetic
components of SHG enhancement. In this paper we report an experimental study of
a metasurface capable of providing electrical and magnetic resonant SHG
enhancement for TM polarization. Our metasurface could be engineered such that
the peak frequencies of electrical and magnetic resonances could be adjusted
independently. We used this feature to distinguish their relative
contributions. Experimentally it was observed that the magnetic resonance
provides only 50% as much enhancement to SHG as compared to the electric
resonance. In addition aligning both resonances in frequency results in
conversion efficiency of 1.32 x 10^(-10).

the absence of an old stellar population, a moderate metallicity and star

conditions within the various complex substructures revealed by the deep
optical images, and to scrutinize at unprecedented spatial resolution the
ionization processes at play in this specific medium. Starburst age, extinction
and metallicity maps of the TDG and surrounding regions were determined using
the strong emission lines Hbeta, [OIII], [OI], [NII], Halpha and [SII] combined
with empirical diagnostics. Discrimination between different ionization
mechanisms was made using BPT--like diagrams and shock plus photoionization
models. Globally, the physical conditions within the star--forming regions are
homogeneous, with in particular an uniform half-solar oxygen abundance. At
small scales, the derived extinction map shows narrow dust lanes. Regions with
atypically strong [OI] emission line immediately surround the TDG. The [OI] /
Halpha ratio cannot be easily accounted for by photoionization by young stars
or shock models. At larger distances from the main star--forming clumps, a
faint diffuse blue continuum emission is observed, both with the deep FORS
images and MUSE data. It does not have a clear counterpart in the UV regime
probed by GALEX. A stacked spectrum towards this region does not exhibit any
emission line, excluding faint levels of star formation, nor stellar absorption
lines that might have revealed the presence of old stars. Several hypotheses

$\tan^2\theta_{ij}= m_i/m_j$. This study of fermion mixing phenomena leads us
to the necessary conditions that are needed in order to obtain it without any
approximation. We begin by considering two Dirac fermion families. By means of
the hierarchy in the masses, it is found that a sufficient and necessary
condition is to have a normal matrix with $m_{11}=0$. This matrix can be
decomposed into two different linearly independent contributions. The origin
for such two independent contributions can be naturally explained by what we
shall call the flavor-blind principle. This principle states that Yukawa
couplings shall be either flavor-blind or decomposed into several sets obeying
distinct permutation symmetries. In general, it is shown that the symmetry
properties of the introduced set of Yukawa matrices follow for $n$ fermion
families the unique sequential breaking $S_{nL}\otimes S_{nR} \rightarrow
S_{(n-1)L}\otimes S_{(n-1)R} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow S_{2L}\otimes
S_{2R} \rightarrow S_{2A}$. The particular case of three fermion families
explains why the four mass ratios parametrization that we recently proposed can
be used even in the case of no hierarchical masses.

ordinary sound modes we find two propagating modes in presence of an external
magnetic field. The first one which is a transverse degenerate mode, propagates
with a velocity proportional to the coefficient of gravitational anomaly; this
is in fact the Chiral Alfv\'en wave recently found in \cite{Yamamoto:2015ria}.
Another one is a wave of density perturbation, namely a chiral magnetic wave
(CMW). The velocity dependence of CMW on the chiral anomaly coefficient is well
known. We compute the dependence of CMW's velocity on the coefficient of
gravitational anomaly as well. We also show that the dissipation splits the
degeneracy of CAW. At finite chiral charge density we show that in general
there may exist five chiral hydrodynamic waves. Of these five waves, one is the
CMW while the other four are mixed Modified Sound-Alfv\'en waves. It turns out
that in propagation transverse to the magnetic field no anomaly effect appear
while in parallel to the magnetic field we find sound waves become dispersive
due to anomaly.

the upper bound on the Ky-Fan $r$-norm of the associated kernel matrix. We give

strongly justifies the definition of our hypothesis set. To the best of our

Our method is able to use unlabeled data to improve classification by adopting
a semi-supervised training approach to learn an ensemble classifier. The

polynomial representing the $n$-bit OR function modulo composite $m$. This
problem is related to understanding the power of circuits with $\text{MOD}_m$
gates where $m$ is composite. The OR function is of particular interest because
it is the simplest function not amenable to bounds from communication
complexity. Tardos and Barrington established a lower bound of $\Omega((\log
n)^{O_m(1)})$, and Barrington, Beigel, and Rudich established an upper bound of
$n^{O_m(1)}$. No progress has been made on closing this gap for twenty years,
and progress will likely require new techniques.
  We make progress on this question viewed from a different perspective: rather
than fixing the modulus $m$ and bounding the minimum degree $d$ in terms of the
number of variables $n$, we fix the degree $d$ and bound $n$ in terms of the
modulus $m$. For degree $d=2$, we prove a quasipolynomial bound of $n\le
m^{O(d)}\le m^{O(\log m)}$, improving the previous best bound of $2^{O(m)}$
implied by Tardos and Barrington's general bound.
  To understand the computational power of quadratic polynomials modulo $m$, we
introduce a certain dichotomy which may be of independent interest. Namely, we
define a notion of boolean rank of a quadratic polynomial $f$ and relate it to
the notion of diagonal rigidity. Using additive combinatorics, we show that
when the rank is low, $f(\mathbf x)=0$ must have many solutions. Using
techniques from exponential sums, we show that when the rank of $f$ is high,
$f$ is close to equidistributed. In either case, $f$ cannot represent the OR
function in many variables.

barrier between the states. Assuming the energy of the system is described by a

two dimensionless parameters are identified which govern the behaviour of the

sufficiently explicit description of the corresponding rate functional is

rate. Kleiber's observation that animals' basal metabolic rate scales to the
3/4-power of body mass (Kleiber's rule) has been the prevailing hypothesis in
the last eight decades. Increasingly, more evidences are supporting the
alternative 2/3-power scaling rule, especially for smaller animals. The
2/3-rule dates back to before Kleiber's time and was thought to originate from
the surface to volume relationship in Euclidean geometry. In this study, we
show that both the 3/4- and 2/3-scaling rules have in fact one common origin.
They are governed by animals' nutrient supply networks-their vascular systems
that obey Murray's law. Murray's law describes the branching pattern of energy
optimized vascular network under laminar flow. It is generally regarded as
being closely followed by blood vessels. Our analysis agrees with experimental
observations and recent numerical analyses that showed a curvature in metabolic
scaling. When applied to metabolic data, our model accurately produces the
observed 2/3-scaling rule for small animals of ~10 kg or less and the 3/4-rule
for all animals excluding the smallest ones (~15 g). The model has broad
implications to the ongoing debate. It proves that both the 3/4- and
2/3-exponents are phenomenological approximations of the same scaling rule
within their applicable mass ranges, and that the 2/3-rule does not originate
from the classical surface law.

significant fraction of its rest mass energy when its periapse is comparable to
its tidal radius. Upon its destruction, a fraction of this energy is extracted
and injected into the stellar debris, half of which becomes unbound from the
black hole, with the fastest material moving at $\sim 0.03 c$. In this paper,
we present a formalism for determining the fate of these unbound debris streams
(UDSs) as they depart from the black hole and interact with the surrounding
gas. As the density and velocity varies along the length of a UDS, we find that
hydrodynamical drag quickly shapes UDSs into loop-like structures, with the
densest portions of the streams leading portions of lower density. As UDSs
travel outwards, their drag against the ISM increases quadratically with
distance, which causes UDSs to deposit their momentum and energy into the
ambient medium before the surrounding shocked ISM has a chance to cool. This
sudden injection of $\sim 10^{50}$ erg into the ambient medium generates a
Sedov-like unbound debris remnant (UDR) that mimics supernova remnants (SNRs)
in energetics and appearance, accelerates particles which will produce cosmic
rays and synchrotron emission, and provides momentum feedback into the
molecular clouds surrounding a black hole. We estimate that a few of these UDRs
might be present within a couple degrees of the Galactic Center masquerading as
SNRs, and that the UDR scenario is a plausible explanation for Sgr A East.

majority (5 out 6) of the AGB targets we find that the abundances, of both iron

with respect to those obtained from ionized features, the latter being,
instead, in agreement with those measured for the RGB targets. This is similar
to recent findings in other clusters and may suggest the presence of Non-Local
Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE) effects. In the O-Na, Al-Mg and Na-Al
planes, the RGB stars show the typical correlations observed for globular
cluster stars. Instead, all the AGB targets are clumped in the regions where
first generation stars are expected to lie, similarly to what recently found
for the AGB population of NGC6752. While the sodium and aluminum abundance
could be underestimated as a consequence of the NLTE bias affecting iron and
titanium, the used oxygen line does not suffer from the same effects and the
lack of O-poor AGB stars therefore is solid. We can thus conclude that none of
the investigated AGB stars belong to the second stellar generation of M62. We
also find a RGB star with extremely high sodium abundance ([Na/Fe] = +1.08

semi-major axis to the location of its host star's ""habitable zone,"" the shell
around a star for which Earth-like planets can possess liquid surface water.
The Kepler space telescope has discovered numerous planet candidates near the
habitable zone, and many more are expected from missions such as K2, TESS and
PLATO. These candidates often require significant follow-up observations for
validation, so prioritizing planets for habitability from transit data has
become an important aspect of the search for life in the universe. We propose a
method to compare transiting planets for their potential to support life based
on transit data, stellar properties and previously reported limits on planetary
emitted flux. For a planet in radiative equilibrium, the emitted flux increases
with eccentricity, but decreases with albedo. As these parameters are often
unconstrained, there is an ""eccentricity-albedo degeneracy"" for the
habitability of transiting exoplanets. Our method mitigates this degeneracy,
includes a penalty for large-radius planets, uses terrestrial mass-radius
relationships, and, when available, constraints on eccentricity to compute a
number we call the ""habitability index for transiting exoplanets"" that
represents the relative probability that an exoplanet could support liquid
surface water. We calculate it for Kepler Objects of Interest and find that
planets that receive between 60-90% of the Earth's incident radiation, assuming
circular orbits, are most likely to be habitable. Finally, we make predictions
for the upcoming TESS and JWST missions.

abundances of Galactic halo stars with [Fe/H] < -2.5, between 0.18 and 3.1 Msun

the dominant grain species are silicates. We also investigate dust formation in
the ejecta of faint Pop III SN, where the ejecta experience a strong fallback.
By examining a set of models, tailored to minimize the scatter with the
abundances of carbon-enhanced Galactic halo stars with [Fe/H ] < -4, we find
that amorphous carbon is the only grain species that forms, with masses in the
range 2.7 10^{-3} - 0.27 Msun (7.5 10^{-4} - 0.11 Msun) for uniformly mixed

and after reaching its minimum in 2015 June has started to increase. Using
archival data, we also found that the I_c-band brightness increased by \approx
3 mag in \approx 30 yr preceding our observations. MN44 therefore represents
the seventeenth known example of the Galactic bona fide LBVs. We detected a
nitrogen-rich knot to the northwest of the star, which might represent an
interstellar cloudlet interacting with the circumstellar shell. We discuss a
possible association between MN44 and the INTEGRAL transient source of hard
X-ray emission IGR J16327-4940, implying that MN44 might be either a
colliding-wind binary or a high-mass X-ray binary.

motivate drivers to rebalance available cars to unpopular destinations within a

powerful method for extracting information from the three-dimensional galaxy
distribution. The precision of such measurements will dramatically increase
with ongoing and future wide-field galaxy surveys. However, these are also
increasingly sensitive to observational and astrophysical contaminants. Here,
we study the statistical properties of three methods proposed for controlling
such systematics -- template subtraction, basic mode projection, and extended
mode projection -- all of which make use of externally supplied template maps,
designed to characterise and capture the spatial variations of potential
systematic effects. Based on a detailed mathematical analysis, and in agreement
with simulations, we find that the template subtraction method in its original
formulation returns biased estimates of the galaxy angular clustering. We
derive closed-form expressions that should be used to correct results for this
shortcoming. Turning to the basic mode projection algorithm, we prove it to be
free of any bias, whereas we conclude that results computed with extended mode
projection are biased. Within a simplified setup, we derive analytical
expressions for the bias and discuss the options for correcting it in more
realistic configurations. Common to all three methods is an increased estimator
variance induced by the cleaning process, albeit at different levels. These
results enable unbiased high-precision clustering measurements in the presence
of spatially-varying systematics, an essential step towards realising the full
potential of current and planned galaxy surveys.

reproduce the observed large star-to-star scatters in the abundance ratios of
r-process elements relative to iron, [Eu/Fe], of extremely metal-poor stars in
the Milky Way (MW) halo. This problem can be solved by considering chemical
evolution in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) which would be building blocks
of the MW and have lower star formation efficiencies than the MW halo. We
demonstrate that enrichment of r-process elements in dSphs by NSMs using an
N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. Our high-resolution model
reproduces the observed [Eu/Fe] by NSMs with a merger time of 100 Myr when the
effect of metal mixing is taken into account. This is because metallicity is
not correlated with time up to ~ 300 Myr from the start of the simulation due
to low star formation efficiency in dSphs. We also confirm that this model is
consistent with observed properties of dSphs such as radial profiles and
metallicity distribution. The merger time and the Galactic rate of NSMs are
suggested to be <~ 300 Myr and ~ $10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$, which are consistent with
the values suggested by population synthesis and nucleosynthesis studies. This

the underlying factors that control this angular momentum loss are important
for the study of stellar spin-down. In this work, we study angular momentum
loss as a function of two different aspects of magnetic activity using a
calibrated Alfv\'en wave-driven magnetohydrodynamic wind model: the strengths
of magnetic spots and their distribution in latitude. By driving the model
using solar and modified solar surface magnetograms, we show that the topology
of the field arising from the net interaction of both small-scale and
large-scale field is important for spin-down rates and that angular momentum
loss is not a simple function of large scale magnetic field strength. We find
that changing the latitude of magnetic spots can modify mass and angular
momentum loss rates by a factor of two. The general effect that causes these
differences is the closing down of large-scale open field at mid- and
high-latitudes by the addition of the small-scale field. These effects might
give rise to modulation of mass and angular momentum loss through stellar
cycles, and present a problem for ab initio attempts to predict stellar
spin-down based on wind models. For all the magnetogram cases considered here,
from dipoles to various spotted distributions, we find that angular momentum
loss is dominated by the mass loss at mid-latitudes. The spin-down torque
applied by magnetized winds therefore acts at specific latitudes and is not
evenly distributed over the stellar surface, though this aspect is unlikely to
be important for understanding spin-down and surface flows on stars.

need to determine the preferable objects based on the categorical preferences

preferences. A naive solution would first assign degrees of match between each
user and each object, by taking into account all categorical attributes, and
then for each object combine these matching degrees across users to compute the
total score of an object. Such an approach, however, performs two series of
aggregation, among categorical attributes and then across users, which
completely obscure and blur individual preferences. Our solution, instead of
combining individual matching degrees, is to directly operate on categorical
attributes, and define an objective Pareto-based aggregation for group
preferences. Building on our interpretation, we tackle two distinct but
relevant problems: finding the Pareto-optimal objects, and objectively ranking
objects with respect to the group preferences. To increase the efficiency when
dealing with categorical attributes, we introduce an elegant transformation of
categorical attribute values into numerical values, which exhibits certain nice
properties and allows us to use well-known index structures to accelerate the
solutions to the two problems. In fact, experiments on real and synthetic data
show that our index-based techniques are an order of magnitude faster than
baseline approaches, scaling up to millions of objects and thousands of users.

in the dimension of the Hilbert space. We find the dimension of a random
subspace of the total Hilbert space such that all pure states that reside on it
almost always have at least a fixed nonzero amount of the relative entropy of
coherence that is arbitrarily close to the typical value of coherence. Further,
we show, with high probability, every state (pure or mixed) in this subspace

date. We derived the 3D geometry of the system, its orbital period $P_{\rm

K and $T_2=41\,120\pm290$ K -- and dynamical masses -- $M_1=28.63\pm0.30

evolutionary models, the VFTS 352 components are too hot for their dynamical
masses by about 2700 and 1100 K, respectively. These results can be explained
naturally as a result of enhanced mixing, theoretically predicted to occur in
very short-period tidally-locked systems. The VFTS 352 components are two of
the best candidates identified so far to undergo this so-called chemically
homogeneous evolution. The future of VFTS 352 is uncertain. If the two stars
merge, a very rapidly rotating star will be produced. Instead, if the stars
continue to evolve homogeneously and keep shrinking within their Roche Lobes,
coalescence can be avoided. In this case, tides may counteract the spin down by
winds such that the VFTS 352 components may, at the end of their life, fulfill
the requirements for long gamma-ray burst (GRB) progenitors in the collapsar
scenario. Independently of whether the VFTS 352 components become GRB
progenitors, this scenario makes VFTS 352 interesting as a progenitor of a
black hole binary, hence as a potential gravitational wave source through black
hole-black hole merger.

vectorial torsion on warped products of arbitrary dimension matching a given
Riemannian or Lorentzian curvature---for example, a $V$-Ricci-flat connection
with vectorial torsion in dimension $4$, explaining some constructions
occurring in general relativity. Finally, we investigate the Dirac operator $D$
of a connection with vectorial torsion. We prove that for exact vector fields,
the $V$-Dirac spectrum coincides with the spectrum of the Riemannian Dirac
operator. We investigate in detail the existence of $V$-parallel spinor fields;
several examples are constructed. It is known that the existence of a
$V$-parallel spinor field implies $dV^\flat=0$ for $n=3$ or $n\geq 5$; for
$n=4$, this is only true on compact manifolds. We prove an identity relating
the $V$-Ricci curvature to the curvature in the spinor bundle. This result
allows us to prove that if there exists a nontrivial $V$-parallel spinor, then
$\mathrm{Ric}^V=0$ for $n\neq 4$ and $\mathrm{Ric}^V(X)=X\lrcorner dV^\flat$
for $n=4$. We conclude that the manifold is conformally equivalent either to a
manifold with Riemannian parallel spinor or to a manifold whose universal cover

Host photometry enables us to infer a black hole mass of $M_{BH}=3 \times 10^6$

sub-Eddington accretion onto the black hole in the form of either an unusually
optically faint AGN or a slowly varying phase of the transient. Optical/IR

of a Galactic halo star that is located in front of the LMC at d=9.2 kpc
distance. We study the velocity-component structure of low and intermediate
metal ions in the spectrum of RXJ0439.8-6809, as obtained with the Cosmic
Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard HST, and measure equivalent widths and
column densities for these ions. We supplement our COS data with a
Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer spectrum of the nearby LMC star Sk-69 59
and with HI 21cm data from the Leiden-Argentina-Bonn (LAB) survey. Metal
absorption towards RXJ0439.8-6809 is unambiguously detected in three different
velocity components near v_LSR=0,+60, and +150 km/s. The presence of absorption
proves that all three gas components are situated in front of the star, thus
being located in the disk and inner halo of the Milky Way. For the
high-velocity cloud (HVC) at v_LSR=+150 km/s we derive an oxygen abundance of
[O/H]=-0.63 (~0.2 solar) from the neighbouring Sk-69 59 sightline, in
accordance with previous abundance measurements for this HVC. From the observed
kinematics we infer that the HVC hardly participates in the Galactic rotation.
Our study shows that the HVC towards the LMC represents a Milky Way halo cloud
that traces low-column density gas with relatively low metallicity. It rules
out scenarios in which the HVC represents material close to the LMC that stems
from a LMC outflow.

energetic-particle (SEP) events, can cause element abundance enhancements or
suppressions that depend upon the mass-to-charge ratio A/Q of the ions as an
increasing function early in events and a decreasing function of the residual
scattered ions later. Since the Q values for the ions depend upon the source
plasma temperature T, best fits, assuming a primarily power-law dependence of
enhancements vs. A/Q, provide a fundamentally new method to determine the most
probable value of T for these events in the region of 3-10 MeV/amu. Complicated
variations in the grouping of element enhancements or suppressions match
similar variations in A/Q at the best-fit temperature. We find that fits to the
times of increasing and decreasing powers give similar values of T, most
commonly in the range of 0.8-1.6 MK for 69% of the events, consistent with the
acceleration of ambient coronal plasma by shock waves driven out from the Sun
by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, 24% of the SEP events studied showed
plasma of 2.5-3.2 MK, typical of that previously determined for the smaller
impulsive SEP events; these particles may be reaccelerated preferentially by
quasi-perpendicular shock waves that require a high injection threshold that
the impulsive-event ions exceed or simply by high intensities of impulsive
suprathermal ions at the shock. The source-temperature distribution of ten
higher-energy ground-level events (GLEs) in the sample is similar to that of
the other gradual events. Some events show evidence that a portion of the ions
have been further stripped of electrons; such events are smaller and tend to
cluster late in the solar cycle.

topologically protected edge states in continuous two-dimensional honeycomb
structures.
  We consider a family of Schr\""odinger Hamiltonians consisting of a bulk
honeycomb potential and a perturbing edge potential. The edge potential
interpolates between two different periodic structures via a domain wall. We
begin by reviewing our recent bifurcation theory of edge states for continuous
two-dimensional honeycomb structures. The topologically protected bifurcation
of edge states is seeded by the zero-energy eigenstate of a one-dimensional
Dirac operator. We contrast these protected bifurcations with (more common)
non-protected bifurcations from spectral band edges, which are induced by bound
states of an effective Schr\""odinger operator.
  Numerical simulations for honeycomb structures of varying contrasts and
""rational edges"" (zigzag, armchair and others), support the following scenario:
(a) For low contrast, under a sign condition on a distinguished Fourier
coefficient of the bulk honeycomb potential, there exist topologically
protected edge states localized transverse to zigzag edges. Otherwise, and for
general edges, we expect long lived {\it edge quasi-modes} which slowly leak
energy into the bulk. (b) For an arbitrary rational edge, there is a threshold
in the medium-contrast (depending on the choice of edge) above which there
exist topologically protected edge states. In the special case of the armchair
edge, there are two families of protected edge states; for each parallel
quasimomentum (the quantum number associated with translation invariance) there
are edge states which propagate in opposite directions along the armchair edge.

of two key components: a Temporal Graph Index (TGI), that compactly stores
large volumes of historical graph evolution data in a partitioned and

problem, for which we need galaxy positions and redshifts. Photometric
redshifts are more easily available for large numbers of galaxies, but at the
price of larger uncertainties than spectroscopic ones. In this work we study
how photometric redshifts affect the measurement of galaxy environment and how
this may limit an analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) in
different environments. Using mock galaxy catalogues, we measured the
environment with a fixed aperture method, using each galaxy's true and
photometric redshifts. We varied the fixed aperture volume parameters and the
photometric redshift uncertainties. We then computed GSMF as a function of
redshift and environment. We found that only when using high-precision
photometric redshifts with $\sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z)} \le 0.01$, the most extreme
environments can be reconstructed in a fairly accurate way, with a fraction
$\ge 60\div 80\%$ of galaxies placed in the correct density quartile and a
contamination of $\le 10\%$ by opposite quartile interlopers. A volume height
comparable to the $\pm 1.5\sigma$ error of photometric redshifts grants a
better reconstruction than other volume configurations. When using such an
environmental measure, we found that any differences between the starting GSMF
(divided accordingly to the true galaxy environment) will be damped on average
of $\sim 0.3$ dex when using photometric redshifts, but will be still
resolvable. These results may be used to interpret real data as we obtained
them in a way that is fairly independent from how well the mock catalogues
reproduce the real galaxy distribution. This work represents a preparatory
study for future wide area photometric redshift surveys such as the Euclid
Survey and we plan to apply these results to an analysis of the GSMF in the
UltraVISTA Survey in future work.

classifiers now represent the state-of-the-art in a wide range of object
detection/classification problems. However, the network complexities of
large-scale classifiers present them as one of the most challenging and energy
intensive workloads across the computing spectrum. In this paper, we present a
new approach to optimize energy efficiency of object detection tasks using
semantic decomposition to build a hierarchical classification framework. We
observe that certain semantic information like color/texture are common across
various images in real-world datasets for object detection applications. We
exploit these common semantic features to distinguish the objects of interest
from the remaining inputs (non-objects of interest) in a dataset at a lower
computational effort. We propose a 2-stage hierarchical classification
framework, with increasing levels of complexity, wherein the first stage is
trained to recognize the broad representative semantic features relevant to the
object of interest. The first stage rejects the input instances that do not
have the representative features and passes only the relevant instances to the
second stage. Our methodology thus allows us to reject certain information at
lower complexity and utilize the full computational effort of a network only on
a smaller fraction of inputs to perform detection. We use color and texture as
distinctive traits to carry out several experiments for object detection. Our
experiments on the Caltech101/CIFAR10 dataset show that the proposed method
yields 1.93x/1.46x improvement in average energy, respectively, over the

classification tools for vision related applications. However, the
computational and energy requirements associated with such deep nets can be

interest. Although traditionally the entire network is utilized for the
recognition of all inputs, we observe that the classification difficulty varies
widely across inputs in real-world datasets; only a small fraction of inputs
require the full computational effort of a network, while a large majority can
be classified correctly with very low effort. In this paper, we propose
Conditional Deep Learning (CDL) where the convolutional layer features are used
to identify the variability in the difficulty of input instances and
conditionally activate the deeper layers of the network. We achieve this by
cascading a linear network of output neurons for each convolutional layer and
monitoring the output of the linear network to decide whether classification
can be terminated at the current stage or not. The proposed methodology thus
enables the network to dynamically adjust the computational effort depending
upon the difficulty of the input data while maintaining competitive
classification accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the MNIST dataset. Our
experiments demonstrate that our proposed CDL yields 1.91x reduction in average

Understanding human social interactions and developing a robot that can

embodied cognition and social interaction of participants gradually change a
symbol system in a constructive manner. In this paper, we introduce a field of

socially self-organized through both semiotic communications and physical
interactions with autonomous cognitive developmental agents, i.e., humans and
developmental robots. Specifically, we describe some state-of-art research
topics concerning SER, e.g., multimodal categorization, word discovery, and a
double articulation analysis, that enable a robot to obtain words and their
embodied meanings from raw sensory--motor information, including visual

signals, in a totally unsupervised manner. Finally, we suggest future
directions of research in SER.

significant parallax measurements and distance measurements, and eighteen lower
limits on distance. We compare these measurements to distances predicted by the
NE2001 interstellar electron density model and find them to be in general
agreement. We use measured orbital-decay rates and spin-down rates to confirm
two of the parallax distances and to place distance upper limits on other
sources; these distance limits agree with the parallax distances with one
exception, PSR J1024-0719, which we discuss at length. Using the proper motions
of the 37 NANOGrav pulsars in combination with other published measurements, we
calculate the velocity dispersion of the millisecond pulsar population in
Galactocentric coordinates. We find the radial, azimuthal, and perpendicular
dispersions to be 46, 40, and 24 km s-1, respectively, in a model that allows
for high-velocity outliers; or 81, 58, and 62 km s-1 for the full population.
These velocity dispersions are far smaller than those of the canonical pulsar
population, and are similar to older Galactic disk populations. This suggests
that millisecond pulsar velocities are largely attributable to their being an
old population rather than being artifacts of their birth and evolution as
neutron star binary systems. The components of these velocity dispersions
follow similar proportions to other Galactic populations, suggesting that our
results are not biased by selection effects.

hilltop ones. Our results show that warm inflation tends to initially favor the
onset of a self-reproduction regime for smaller values of the dissipation. As
the dissipation increases, it becomes harder than in cold inflation (i.e., in
the absence of dissipation) to achieve a self-reproduction regime for both
types of models analyzed. The results are interpreted and explicit analytical
expressions are given whenever that is possible.

tractable set, namely a set of ""fast-mixing parameters"" where Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference can be guaranteed to quickly converge to the
stationary distribution. While it is common in practice to approximate the
likelihood gradient using samples obtained from MCMC, such procedures lack
theoretical guarantees. This paper proves that for any exponential family with
bounded sufficient statistics, (not just graphical models) when parameters are
constrained to a fast-mixing set, gradient descent with gradients approximated
by sampling will approximate the maximum likelihood solution inside the set
with high-probability. When unregularized, to find a solution epsilon-accurate
in log-likelihood requires a total amount of effort cubic in 1/epsilon,
disregarding logarithmic factors. When ridge-regularized, strong convexity
allows a solution epsilon-accurate in parameter distance with effort quadratic
in 1/epsilon. Both of these provide of a fully-polynomial time randomized

high-$z$ star-forming galaxies with large Subaru samples of Lyman-alpha
emitters (LAEs) at $z=2.2$. We make subsamples defined by the physical
quantities of LAEs' central Lyman-alpha luminosities, UV magnitudes,
Lyman-alpha equivalent widths, and UV slopes, and investigate LAHs' radial
surface brightness (SB) profiles and scale lengths $r_n$ as a function of these
physical quantities. We find that there exist prominent LAHs around LAEs with
faint Lyman-alpha luminosities, bright UV luminosities, and small Lyman-alpha
equivalent widths in cumulative radial Lyman-alpha SB profiles. We confirm this
trend with the anti-correlation between $r_n$ and Lyman-alpha luminosities
(equivalent widths) based on the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient that
is $\rho=-0.9$ ($-0.7$) corresponding to the $96\%$ ($93\%$) confidence level,
although the correlation between $r_n$ and UV magnitudes is not clearly found
in the rank correlation coefficient. Our results suggest that LAEs with
properties similar to typical Lyman-break galaxies (with faint Lyman-alpha
luminosities and small equivalent widths) possess more prominent LAHs. We
investigate scenarios for the major physical origins of LAHs with our results,
and find that the cold stream scenario is not preferred, due to the relatively
small equivalent widths up to $77$\AA\ in LAHs that include LAEs' central
components. There remain two possible scenarios of Lyman-alpha scattering in
circum-galactic medium and satellite galaxies that cannot be tested with our
observational data.

stochastic setting, where our goal is to find a direction of approximate
maximal variance, based on a stream of i.i.d. data points in $\reals^d$. A
simple and computationally cheap algorithm for this is stochastic gradient
descent (SGD), which incrementally updates its estimate based on each new data
point. However, due to the non-convex nature of the problem, analyzing its
performance has been a challenge. In particular, existing guarantees rely on a
non-trivial eigengap assumption on the covariance matrix, which is intuitively
unnecessary. In this paper, we provide (to the best of our knowledge) the first
eigengap-free convergence guarantees for SGD in the context of PCA. This also
partially resolves an open problem posed in \cite{hardt2014noisy}. Moreover,
under an eigengap assumption, we show that the same techniques lead to new SGD
convergence guarantees with better dependence on the eigengap.

that the mass of highly magnetized or modified Einstein's gravity induced white
dwarfs could be significantly super-Chandrasekhar and such white dwarfs could
altogether have a different mass-limit. On the other hand, type Ia supernovae
(SNeIa), a key to unravel the evolutionary history of the universe, are
believed to be triggered in white dwarfs having mass close to the
Chandrasekhar-limit. However, observations of several peculiar, over- and
under-luminous SNeIa argue for exploding masses widely different from this
limit. We argue that explosions of super-Chandrasekhar limiting mass white
dwarfs result in over-luminous SNeIa. We arrive at this revelation, first by
considering simplistic, spherical, Newtonian white dwarfs with constant
magnetic fields. Then we relax the Newtonian assumption and consider the
varying fields, however obtain similar results. Finally, we consider a full
scale general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic description of white dwarfs
allowing their self-consistent departure from a sphere to ellipsoid.

quantum black hole will retain a discrete profile, at least in the weak energy

of the simplicity of eigen-spectrum of the model considered. Different quantum
theories can, in principle, give rise to different complicated spectra and make
the radiation from black hole dense enough in transition lines, to make them
look continuous in profile. We show that such a hope from a geometry-quantized

a classical mass area relation in any gravity theory ranging from GR,
Lanczos-Lovelock to f(R) gravity. We show that the smallest frequency of

the Anderson modes increases when the width of the Bragg gap decreases, such
that in the vanishingly small bandgap limit, namely when a Dirac point is
formed, even extremely high levels of disorders are unable to localize the
optical modes located near the Dirac point. A comparative analysis of the key
features of the propagation of Anderson modes formed in the Bragg gap or near
the Dirac point is also presented. Our findings could provide valuable
guidelines in assessing the influence of structural disorder on the
functionality of a broad array of optical nanodevices.

of research that has seen much progress in recent years. In this contribution
we briefly review the processes describing the journey of BHs during mergers,
from the cosmic context all the way to when BHs coalesce. If two galaxies each
hosting a central BH merge, the BHs would be dragged towards the center of the
newly formed galaxy. If/when the holes get sufficiently close, they coalesce
via the emission of gravitational waves. How often two BHs are involved in
galaxy mergers depends crucially on how many galaxies host BHs and on the
galaxy merger history. It is therefore necessary to start with full
cosmological models including BH physics and a careful dynamical treatment.
After galaxies have merged, however, the BHs still have a long journey until
they touch and coalesce. Their dynamical evolution is radically different in
gas-rich and gas-poor galaxies, leading to a sort of ""dichotomy"" between
high-redshift and low-redshift galaxies, and late-type and early-type,
typically more massive galaxies.

most works have focused on the effects from isolated free edges, we present a
novel knotting phenomenon induced by the interactions between a pair of free
edges in graphene, and investigate its effect on the buckling of monolayer
graphene. Upon compression, the buckling of graphene starts gradually in the
form of two buckling waves from the warped edges. The collision of these two
buckling waves results in the creation of a knot structure in graphene. The
knot structure enables the buckled graphene to exhibit two unique post-buckling
characteristics. First, it induces a five-fold increase in graphene's
mechanical stiffness during the buckling process. Second, the knotted structure
enables graphene to exhibit a mechanically stable post-buckling regime over a
large (3%) compressive strain regime, which is significantly larger than the
critical buckling strain of about 0.5%. The combination of these two effects
enables graphene to exhibit an unexpected post-buckling stability that has
previously not been reported. We predict that numerical simulations or
experiments should observe two distinct stress strain relations for the
buckling of identical graphene samples, due to the characteristic randomness in
the formation process of the knot structure.

an array of SCDs to map the global surface elemental abundances on the Moon

  The objective of this paper is to demonstrate validation of a physical model
developed to simulate X-ray photon interaction and charge transportation in a
SCD. The model helps to understand and identify the origin of individual
components that collectively contribute to the energy-dependent spectral
response of the SCD. Furthermore, the model provides completeness to various

SCDs.
  We compare simulation results of the SCD CCD54 with measurements obtained
during the ground calibration of C1XS and clearly demonstrate that our model
reproduces all the major spectral features seen in calibration data. We also
describe our understanding of interactions at different layers of SCD that

  In this paper, we show how to achieve the same guarantees using

Moreover, one may further reduce the work to $\operatorname{\tilde{O}}(m +

campaign of ASASSN-15ed. The transient was discovered quite young by the All
Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). Amateur astronomers allowed us
to sample the photometric SN evolution around maximum light, which we estimate
to have occurred on JD = 2457087.4 +- 0.6 in the r-band. Its apparent r-band
magnitude at maximum was r = 16.91 +- 0.10, providing an absolute magnitude
M(r) ~ -20.04 +- 0.20, which is slightly more luminous than the typical
magnitudes estimated for Type Ibn SNe. The post-peak evolution was well
monitored, and the decline rate (being in most bands around 0.1 mag/d during
the first 25 d after maximum) is marginally slower than the average decline
rates of SNe Ibn during the same time interval. The object was initially
classified as a Type Ibn SN because early-time spectra were characterized by a
blue continuum with superimposed narrow P-Cygni lines of He I, suggesting the
presence of a slowly moving (1200-1500 km/s), He-rich circumstellar medium.
Later on, broad P-Cygni He I lines became prominent. The inferred velocities,
as measured from the minimum of the broad absorption components, were between
6000 and 7000 km/s. As we attribute these broad features to the SN ejecta, this
is the first time we have observed the transition of a Type Ibn SN to a Type Ib
SN.

differentiable module and an unbounded cycle of a very general kind that
includes all unbounded Kasparov modules and hence also all spectral triples.
Our assumptions on the differentiable module are weak and we do in particular
not require that it satisfies any kind of smooth projectivity conditions. The
algebras that we work with are furthermore not required to possess a smooth
approximate identity. The lack of an adequate projectivity condition on our
differentiable module entails that the usual class of unbounded Kasparov
modules is not flexible enough to accommodate the unbounded Kasparov product
and it becomes necessary to twist the commutator condition by an automorphism.
We show that the unbounded Kasparov product makes sense in this twisted setting
and that it recovers the usual interior Kasparov product after taking bounded
transforms. Since our unbounded cycles are twisted (or modular) we are not able
to apply the work of Kucerovsky for recognizing unbounded representatives for
the bounded Kasparov product, instead we rely directly on the connection
criterion developed by Connes and Skandalis. In fact, since we do not impose
any twisted Lipschitz regularity conditions on our unbounded cycles, even the
passage from an unbounded cycle to a bounded Kasparov module requires a
substantial amount of extra care.

proposed here is valid for all the interaction regimes of cavity-quantum
electrodynamics: from the weak to the strong, ultrastrong, and deep coupling
regimes. For coupling rates comparable or larger then the cavity resonance
frequency, the standard input-output theory for optical cavities fails to
calculate the correct output field-quadratures and predicts a non-negligible
amount of output squeezing, even if the system is in its ground state. Here we
show that, for arbitrary interactions and cavity-embedded quantum systems, no
squeezing can be found in the output-field quadratures if the system is in its
ground state. We also apply the proposed theoretical approach to study the
output squeezing produced by: (i) an artificial two-level atom embedded in a
coherently-excited cavity; and (ii) a cascade-type three-level system
interacting with a cavity field mode. In the latter case the output squeezing
arises from the virtual photons of the atom-cavity dressed states. This work
extends the possibility of predicting and analyzing continuous-variable optical
quantum-state tomography when optical resonators interact very strongly with
other quantum systems.

J07285387+3349106 exploded in the inner region of an infrared luminous galaxy,

derive the total reddening to the SN, and determine a total colour excess
E(B-V)(tot) = 0.99 +- 0.48 mag. Accounting for the reddening correction, which
is affected by a large uncertainty, we estimate a peak absolute magnitude of
M(V) = -20.30 +- 1.50. The spectra are dominated by continuum emission at early
phases, and He I lines with narrow P-Cygni profiles are detected. We also
identify weak Fe III and N II features. All these lines show an absorption
component which is blue-shifted by about 900-1000 km/s. The spectra also show
relatively broad He I line wings with low contrast, which extend to above 3000
km/s. From about 2 weeks past maximum, broad lines of O I, Mg II and the Ca II
near-infrared triplet are identified. The composition and the expansion
velocity of the circumstellar material, and the presence of He I and
alpha-elements in the SN ejecta indicate that PSN J07285387+3349106 was
produced by the core-collapse of a stripped-envelope star. We suggest that the
precursor was WNE-type Wolf-Rayet star in its dense, He-rich circumstellar

arranged by amateur astronomers allowed us to monitor the rising phase (lasting
10.6 days) and to accurately estimate the epoch of the maximum light, on 2014
April 23 (JD = 2456771.1 +/- 1.2). The absolute magnitude of the SN at the
maximum light is M(R) = -19.76 +/- 0.16. The post-peak light curve shows an
initial fast decline lasting about 3 weeks, and is followed by a slower decline
in all bands until the end of the monitoring campaign. The spectra are
initially characterized by a hot continuum. Later on, the temperature declines
and a number of lines become prominent mostly in emission. In particular, later
spectra are dominated by strong and narrow emission features of He I typical of
Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), although there is a clear signature of lines from
heavier elements (in particular O I, Mg II and Ca II). A forest of relatively
narrow Fe II lines is also detected showing P-Cygni profiles, with the

driven by a time-dependent voltage. It is shown that for standard set-ups where
an external voltage is applied to a tunnel junction via an impedance,
time-dependent driving entails an excitation of the modes of the
electromagnetic environment by the applied voltage. Previous approaches for ac
driven circuits need to be extended to account for the driven bath modes. A
unitary transformation involving also the variables of the electromagnetic
environment is introduced which allows to split-off the time-dependence from
the Hamiltonian in the absence of tunneling. This greatly simplifies
perturbation-theoretical calculations based on treating the tunneling
Hamiltonian as a perturbation. In particular, the average current flowing in
the leads of the tunnel junction is studied. Explicit results are given for the
case of an applied voltage with a constant dc part and a sinusoidal ac part.
The connection with standard dynamical Coulomb blockade theory for constant
applied voltage is established. It is shown that an alternating voltage source
reveals significant additional effects caused by the electromagnetic
environment. The hallmark of dynamical Coulomb blockade in ac driven devices is
a suppression of higher harmonics of the current by the electromagnetic
environment. The theory presented basically applies to all tunneling devices
driven by alternating voltages.

unitary implementation of the dynamics. When quantizing free scalar fields in
homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes with compact spatial sections, these
criteria have been shown to pick out a unique Fock representation (up to
unitary equivalence). Here, we employ the same criteria for fermion fields and
explore whether that uniqueness result can be extended to the case of the Fock
quantization of fermions. For the massive Dirac field, we start by introducing
a specific choice of the complex structure that determines the Fock
representation. Such structure is invariant under the symmetries of the
equations of motion. We then prove that the corresponding representation of the
canonical anticommutation relations admits a unitary implementation of the
dynamics. Moreover, we construct a rather general class of representations that
satisfy the above criteria, and we demonstrate that they are all unitarily
equivalent to our previous choice. The complex structures in this class are
restricted only by certain conditions on their asymptotic behavior for modes in
the ultraviolet sector of the Dirac operator. We finally show that, if one
assumes that these asymptotic conditions are in fact trivial once our criteria
are fulfilled, then the time-dependent scaling in the definition of the
fermionic annihilation and creation-like variables is essentially unique.

hand, what moves is not only interesting objects but also noise and cluttered

not to be detected. So there are undesirable false alarms and missed alarms in
many algorithms of moving object detection. To reduce the false alarms and
missed alarms, in this paper, we propose to incorporate a saliency map into an
incremental subspace analysis framework where the saliency map makes estimated
background has less chance than foreground (i.e., moving objects) to contain

used as a true conserved variable, where CAPE is the convective available
energy.
  It is shown in this comment that the quantity denoted by CAPE in R15 is the
opposite of the convective available energy. It is explained that the vertical
adiabatic ascent considered in R15 is not realistic, since it generates
condensed water of the order of 10 to 20 g/kg at height above 6 km. Moreover,
the thermodynamic equations are written in R15 by making several assumptions,
not all of which are explicitly mentioned.
  This comment aims to clarify the hypotheses made in R15. It will show that
these assumptions call into question the validity of the moist-air internal
energy, enthalpy and entropy functions in R15. It also demonstrates that it is
possible to obtain more precise and general formulations for moist-air energy,
enthalpy and entropy functions, in particular by using the third law of
thermodynamics. The large differences between the thermodynamics formulas
derived in R15 and those depending on the third law are illustrated by studying
a realistic pseudo-adiabatic vertical profile.

of the temporal evolution of the system in terms of a chemical master equation
(CME). In this paper we study two approaches for approximating the underlying
probability distributions of the CME. The first approach is based on an
integration of the statistical moments and the reconstruction of the
distribution based on the maximum entropy principle. The second approach relies
on an analytical approximation of the probability distribution of the CME using
the system size expansion, considering higher-order terms than the linear noise
approximation. We consider gene expression networks with unimodal and
multimodal protein distributions to compare the accuracy of the two approaches.
We find that both methods provide accurate approximations to the distributions
of the CME while having different benefits and limitations in applications.

analysis of seismic phenomena, which cannot be taken in account using standard
probabilistic seismic input (PSHA): a) any structure at a given location,
regardless of its importance, is subject to the same shaking as a result of a
given earthquake, b) it is impossible to determine when a future earthquake of
a given intensity/magnitude will occur, c) insufficient data are available to
develop reliable statistics with regards to earthquakes. On the basis of these
considerations, the seismic input at a given site - determined on the basis of
the seismic history, the seismogenic zones and the seismogenic nodes - is
defined using the Neo Deterministic Seismic Hazard Assessment (NDSHA). Two
different analysis are carried out at different levels of detail. The first one
(RSA) provides the Maximum Deterministic Seismic Input as a response spectra at
the bedrock (MDSIBD), similarly to what is proposed by the codes. The second
one (SSA) takes the site effects into account, providing a site specific
seismic input (MDSISS). A SSA provides realistic site specific seismograms that
could be used to run time history analysis even where no registrations are
available. Reviewing the standard PBD procedure, MDSISS is always associated
with the worst structural performance acceptable for a building, called Target
Performance Level (TPL). In this way, the importance of the structure (risk
category) is taken into account by changing the structural performance level to
check rather than to change the seismic input.

remains intractable, necessitating the use of computationally intensive methods
such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. Designing an efficient proposal mechanism
which can be applied to a noisy and partially observed system that exhibits
nonlinear dynamics is a challenging problem, and is the focus of this paper. By
partitioning the process into two parts, one that accounts for nonlinear
dynamics in a deterministic way, and another as a residual stochastic process,
we develop a class of novel constructs that bridge the residual process via a

widened to the low mass region, both from theoretical and experimental side. We
discuss results from data obtained in 2013 with a single detector TUM40. This
detector is equipped with a new upgraded holding scheme to efficiently veto
backgrounds induced by surface alpha decays. This veto, the low threshold of
0.6keV and an unprecedented background level for CaWO$_4$ target crystals
render TUM40 the detector with the best overall performance of CRESST-II phase
2 (July 2013 - August 2015). A low-threshold analysis allowed to investigate
light dark matter particles (<3GeV/c$^2$), previously not accessible for other
direct detection experiments.

and spread of radioactive nuclides in the environment. These radionuclides can
be natural or anthropogenic in origin. The field of view describes the area of
radionuclides on, or below, the ground that is responsible for determining the
air dose rate, and hence correspondingly the external radiation exposure. This
work describes Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations for the field of
view under a variety of situations. Presented first are results for natural 40K
and thorium and uranium series radionuclides distributed homogeneously within
the ground. Results are then described for atmospheric radioactive caesium
fallout, such as from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.
Various stages of fallout evolution are considered through the depth
distribution of 134Cs and 137Cs in soil. The fields of view for the natural
radionuclides and radiocaesium are different. This can affect the responses of
radiation monitors to these nuclides if the detector is partially shielded from
the ground within its field of view. The field of view also sets the maximum
reduction in air dose rates that can be achieved through local decontamination
or remediation measures. This maximum efficiency can be determined quickly from
the data presented here for the air dose rate versus the spatial extent of
radioactive source on the ground.

ejection of columns of chromospheric plasma, part of them falling back to the
solar surface, associated with a M2.5 flare and a type-II radio burst. Images
acquired by the SOHO/LASCO coronagraphs (C2 and C3) were employed to track the
CME-driven shock in the corona between 2-12 R$_\odot$ in an angular interval of
about 110$^\circ$. In these intervals we derived 2-Dimensional (2D) maps of
electron density, shock velocity and shock compression ratio, and we measured
the shock inclination angle with respect to the radial direction. Under
plausible assumptions, these quantities were used to infer 2D maps of shock
Mach number $M_\text{A}$ and strength of coronal magnetic fields at the shock's
heights. We found that in the early phases (2-4 R$_\odot$) the whole shock
surface is super-Alfv\'enic, while later on (i.e. higher up) it becomes
super-Alfvenic only at the nose. This is in agreement with the location for the
source of the observed type-II burst, as inferred from RDS combined with the
shock kinematic and coronal densities derived from WL. For the first time, a
coronal shock is used to derive a 2D map of the coronal magnetic field strength

of magnetic field multi-scale fluctuations in the solar wind near the solar

during the whole year 2008. The conditional statistics involves the magnetic
field time series splitted into concatenated subsets of data according to a
threshold in dynamic pressure. The threshold separates fast stream leading edge
compressional and trailing edge uncompressional fluctuations. The histograms
obtained from these data sets are associated with both large-scale (B) and
small-scale ({\delta}B) magnetic fluctuations, the latter corresponding to
time-delayed differences. It is shown here that, by keeping flexibility but
avoiding the unnecessary redundancy in modeling, the histograms can be
effectively described by a limited set of theoretical probability distribution
functions (PDFs), such as the normal, log-normal, kappa and logkappa functions.
In a statistical sense the model PDFs correspond to additive and multiplicative
processes exhibiting correlations. It is demonstrated here that the skewed
small-scale histograms inherent in turbulent cascades are better described by
the skewed log-kappa than by the symmetric kappa model. Nevertheless, the
observed skewness is rather small, resulting in potential difficulties of
estimation of the third-order moments. This paper also investigates the
dependence of the statistical convergence of PDF model parameters, goodness of
fit and skewness on the data sample size. It is shown that the minimum lengths
of data intervals required for the robust estimation of parameters is scale,

Proposed method does not require application of any (oscillating or static)

modulation of confining potential induced by electric gates, which, in turn
leads to oscillating Rashba type spin-orbit coupling. Moving electron back and
forth in such a variable Rashba field allows for realization of spin rotations
around two different axes separately without using an external magnetic field.

design. However, contrary to the standard model, empirical studies suggest that
a bidder's valuation often does not depend solely on the goods assigned to him.
For instance, in adwords auctions an advertiser might not want his ads to be
displayed next to his competitors' ads. In this paper, we propose and analyze
several natural graph-theoretic models that incorporate such negative
externalities, in which bidders form a directed conflict graph with maximum
out-degree $\Delta$. We design algorithms and truthful mechanisms for social
welfare maximization that attain approximation ratios depending on $\Delta$.
  For CA, our results are twofold: (1) A lottery that eliminates conflicts by
discarding bidders/items independent of the bids. It allows to apply any
truthful $\alpha$-approximation mechanism for conflict-free valuations and
yields an $\mathcal{O}(\alpha\Delta)$-approximation mechanism. (2) For
fractionally sub-additive valuations, we design a rounding algorithm via a
novel combination of a semi-definite program and a linear program, resulting in
a cone program; the approximation ratio is $\mathcal{O}((\Delta \log \log
\Delta)/\log \Delta)$. The ratios are almost optimal given existing hardness
results.
  For the prominent application of adwords auctions, we present several
algorithms for the most relevant scenario when the number of items is small. In
particular, we design a truthful mechanism with approximation ratio $o(\Delta)$
when the number of items is only logarithmic in the number of bidders.

engineering approach of the CIS in a specific enterprise interoperability

Modeling Notation (BPMN) is used to represent the CBP model. We develop a
knowledge-based system (KbS) which is composed of three main parts: knowledge
gathering, knowledge representation and reasoning, and collaborative business
process modelling. The first part starts from a high abstraction level where
knowledge from business partners is captured. A collaboration ontology is
defined in order to provide a structure to store and use the knowledge
captured. In parallel, we try to reuse generic existing knowledge about
business processes from the MIT Process Handbook repository. This results in a
collaboration process ontology that is also described. A set of rules is
defined in order to extract knowledge about fragments of the CBP model from the
two previous ontologies. These fragments are finally assembled in the third
part of the KbS. A prototype of the KbS has been developed in order to
implement and support this approach. The prototype is a computer-aided design
tool of the CBP. In this paper, we will present the theoretical aspects of each

significant events that will lead to a subsequent evolution of the situation

structure of the part of the system that is in charge of MIS agility. This
architecture takes the events into account, manages them and, if needed, uses

dominates for weakly helical distortions. While long-ranged or `soft' chiral
forces usually lead to a pitch decreasing linearly with concentration, steric
chirality leads to a much steeper decrease of quadratic nature. This reveals a
subtle link between the range of chiral intermolecular interaction and the
pitch sensitivity with concentration. A much richer dependence on the

penalty is the sum of squared regression coefficients, giving rise to ridge
regression. Here many aspect of ridge regression are reviewed e.g. moments,
mean squared error, its equivalence to constrained estimation, and its relation

issue. It avoids biases associated with the language or toolkit used to develop
the original model, not only promoting its verification and validation, but
also fostering the credibility of the underlying conceptual model. However,
different model implementations must be compared to assess their equivalence.
The problem is, given two or more implementations of a stochastic model, how to
prove that they display similar behavior? In this paper, we present a model
comparison technique, which uses principal component analysis to convert
simulation output into a set of linearly uncorrelated statistical measures,
analyzable in a consistent, model-independent fashion. It is appropriate for
ascertaining distributional equivalence of a model replication with its
original implementation. Besides model-independence, this technique has three
other desirable properties: a) it automatically selects output features that
best explain implementation differences; b) it does not depend on the
distributional properties of simulation output; and, c) it simplifies the
modelers' work, as it can be used directly on simulation outputs. The proposed
technique is shown to produce similar results to the manual or empirical
selection of output features when applied to a well-studied reference model.

namely to the verification of quantum computations in the regime of high
computational complexity. Our results are given in the language of quantum
interactive proof systems. Specifically, we show that any language in
$\mathsf{BQP}$ has a quantum interactive proof system with a polynomial-time
classical verifier (who can also prepare random single-qubit pure states), and
a quantum polynomial-time prover. Here, soundness is unconditional--i.e., it
holds even for computationally unbounded provers. Compared to prior work
achieving similar results, our technique does not require the encoding of the
input or of the computation; instead, we rely on encryption of the input
(together with a method to perform computations on encrypted inputs), and show
that the random choice between three types of input (defining a computational
run, versus two types of test runs) suffices. Because the overhead is very low
for each run (it is linear in the size of the circuit), this shows that
verification could be achieved at minimal cost compared to performing the
computation. As a proof technique, we use a reduction to an entanglement-based
protocol; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this technique
has been used in the context of verification of quantum computations, and it
enables a relatively straightforward analysis.

exotic singularities such as the big rip are the boundaries of the classical
spacetimes. These events are marked by a divergence in the curvature invariants
and the breakdown of the geodesic evolution. Recent progress on implementing
techniques of loop quantum gravity to cosmological models reveals that such
singularities may be generically resolved because of the quantum gravitational
effects. Due to the quantum geometry, which replaces the classical differential
geometry at the Planck scale, the big bang is replaced by a big bounce without
any assumptions on the matter content or any fine tuning. In this manuscript,
we discuss some of the main features of this approach and the results on the
generic resolution of singularities for the isotropic as well as anisotropic
models. Using effective spacetime description of the quantum theory, we show
the way quantum gravitational effects lead to the universal bounds on the
energy density, the Hubble rate and the anisotropic shear. We discuss the
geodesic completeness in the effective spacetime and the resolution of all of
the strong singularities. It turns out that despite the bounds on energy
density and the Hubble rate, there can be divergences in the curvature
invariants. However such events are geodesically extendible, with tidal forces
not strong enough to cause inevitable destruction of the in-falling objects.

backscattering and thereby nonquantized transport. Here we find analytically
the new dispersion relations and the energy dependent spin orientation of the

a finite width ribbon. In the single-edge case, we analytically quantify the
energy dependence of the spin orientation, which turns out to be weak for a
realistic HgTe quantum well. Nevertheless, finite size effects combined with
Rashba spin-orbit coupling result in two avoided crossings in the energy
dispersions, where the spin orientation variation of the edge states is very
significantly increased for realistic parameters. Finally, our analytical
results are found to compare well to a numerical tight-binding regularization

temperature of 10 MK along the flare ribbon during the flare peak and several
minutes into the decay phase with upflow velocities between 30 km s$^{-1}$ and
200 km s$^{-1}$. Hard X-ray (HXR) footpoints were observed by RHESSI for two
minutes during the peak of the flare. Their locations coincided with the
locations of the upflows in parts of the southern flare ribbon but the HXR
footpoint source preceded the observation of upflows in FeXXI by 30-75 seconds.
However, in other parts of the southern ribbon and in the northern ribbon the
observed upflows were not coincident with a HXR source in time nor space, most
prominently during the decay phase. In this case evaporation is likely caused
by energy input via a conductive flux that is established between the hot (25
MK) coronal source, which is present during the whole observed time-interval,
and the chromosphere. The presented observations suggest that conduction may
drive evaporation not only during the decay phase but also during the flare

  European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA 2016)",,,,"cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Approximate Spectral Clustering (ASC) is a popular and successful heuristic
for partitioning the nodes of a graph $G$ into clusters for which the ratio of
outside connections compared to the volume (sum of degrees) is small. ASC
consists of the following two subroutines: i) compute an approximate Spectral
Embedding via the Power method; and ii) partition the resulting vector set with
an approximate $k$-means clustering algorithm. The resulting $k$-means
partition naturally induces a $k$-way node partition of $G$.
  We give a comprehensive analysis of ASC building on the work of Peng et
al.~(SICOMP'17), Boutsidis et al.~(ICML'15) and Ostrovsky et al.~(JACM'13). We
show that ASC i) runs efficiently, and ii) yields a good approximation of an
optimal $k$-way node partition of $G$. Moreover, we strengthen the quality
guarantees of a structural result of Peng et al. by a factor of $k$, and
simultaneously weaken the eigenvalue gap assumption. Further, we show that ASC
finds a $k$-way node partition of $G$ with the strengthened quality guarantees.

individual cells, and hence are subject to considerable random fluctuations
(noise) in copy number over time. Not surprisingly, cells encode diverse
regulatory mechanisms to buffer noise. One such mechanism is the incoherent
feedforward circuit. We analyze a simplistic version of this circuit, where an
upstream regulator X affects both the production and degradation of a protein
Y. Thus, any random increase in X's copy numbers would increase both production
and degradation, keeping Y levels unchanged. To study its stochastic dynamics,
we formulate this network into a mathematical model using the Chemical Master
Equation formulation. We prove that if the functional dependence of Y's
production and degradation on X is similar, then the steady-distribution of Y's
copy numbers is independent of X. To investigate how fluctuations in Y
propagate downstream, a protein Z whose production rate only depend on Y is
introduced. Intriguingly, results show that the extent of noise in Z increases
with noise in X, in spite of the fact that the magnitude of noise in Y is
invariant of X. Such counter intuitive results arise because X enhances the
time-scale of fluctuations in Y, which amplifies fluctuations in downstream
processes. In summary, while feedforward systems can buffer a protein from
noise in its upstream regulators, noise can propagate downstream due to changes
in the time-scale of fluctuations.

point in the three-dimensional Euclidean space (3D-space) and synchronously
executes a common distributed algorithm. We investigate the pattern formation
problem that requires the robots to form a given target pattern from an initial
configuration and characterize the problem by showing a necessary and
sufficient condition for the robots to form a given target pattern.
  The pattern formation problem in the two dimensional Euclidean space
(2D-space) has been investigated by Suzuki and Yamashita (SICOMP 1999, TCS
2010), and Fujinaga et al. (SICOMP 2015). The symmetricity $\rho(P)$ of a
configuration (i.e., the positions of robots) $P$ is intuitively the order of
the cyclic group that acts on $P$. It has been shown that fully-synchronous
(FSYNC) robots can form a target pattern $F$ from an initial configuration $P$
if and only if $\rho(P)$ divides $\rho(F)$.
  We extend the notion of symmetricity to 3D-space by using the rotation groups
each of which is defined by a set of rotation axes and their arrangement. We
define the symmetricity $\varrho(P)$ of configuration $P$ in 3D-space as the
set of rotation groups that acts on $P$ and whose rotation axes do not contain
any robot. We show the following necessary and sufficient condition for the
pattern formation problem which is a natural extension of the existing results
of the pattern formation problem in 2D-space: FSYNC robots in 3D-space can form
a target pattern $F$ from an initial configuration $P$ if and only if
$\varrho(P) \subseteq \varrho(F)$. For solvable instances, we present a pattern
formation algorithm for oblivious FSYNC robots. The insight of this paper is
that symmetry of mobile robots in 3D-space is sometimes lower than the symmetry
of their positions and the robots can show their symmetry by their movement.

ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The proposed method is
single-stage, single-step, maintains a discrete divergence-free condition on
the magnetic field, and has the capacity to preserve the positivity of the
density and pressure. To accomplish this, we use a Taylor discretization of the
Picard integral formulation (PIF) of the finite difference WENO method proposed
in [SINUM, 53 (2015), pp. 1833--1856], where the focus is on a high-order
discretization of the fluxes (as opposed to the conserved variables). We use
the version where fluxes are expanded to third-order accuracy in time, and for
the fluid variables space is discretized using the classical fifth-order finite
difference WENO discretization. We use constrained transport in order to obtain
divergence-free magnetic fields, which means that we simultaneously evolve the
magnetohydrodynamic and magnetic potential equations, and set the magnetic
field to be the (discrete) curl of the magnetic potential after each time step.
In this work, we compute these curls to fourth-order accuracy. In order to
retain a single-stage, single-step method, we develop a novel Lax-Wendroff
discretization for the evolution of the magnetic potential, where we start with
technology used for Hamilton-Jacobi equations in order to construct a
non-oscillatory magnetic field. Positivity preservation is realized by
introducing a parameterized flux limiter that considers a linear combination of
high and low-order numerical fluxes. This positivity limiter lacks energy
conservation. However, this limiter can be dropped for problems where the
pressure does not become negative. We present two and three dimensional
numerical results for several standard test problems. These results assert the
robustness and verify the high-order of accuracy of the proposed scheme.

  shape","10 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is a common need to search of molecular databases for compounds
resembling some shape, what suggests having similar biological activity while
searching for new drugs. The large size of the databases requires fast methods
for such initial screening, for example based on feature vectors constructed to
fulfill the requirement that similar molecules should correspond to close
vectors. Ultrafast Shape Recognition (USR) is a popular approach of this type.
It uses vectors of 12 real number as 3 first moments of distances from 4
emphasized points. These coordinates might contain unnecessary correlations and
does not allow to reconstruct the approximated shape. In contrast, spherical
harmonic (SH) decomposition uses orthogonal coordinates, suggesting their
independence and so lager informational content of the feature vector. There is
usually considered rotationally invariant SH descriptors, what means discarding
of some essential information.
  This article discusses framework for descriptors with normalized rotation,
for example by using principal component analysis (PCA-SH). As one of the most
interesting are ligands which have to slide into a protein, we will introduce
descriptors optimized for such flat elongated shapes. Bent deformed cylinder
(BDC) describes the molecule as a cylinder which was first bent, then deformed
such that its cross-sections became ellipses of evolving shape. Legendre
polynomials are used to describe the central axis of such bent cylinder.
Additional polynomials are used to define evolution of such elliptic
cross-section along the main axis. There will be also discussed bent
cylindrical harmonics (BCH), which uses cross-sections described by cylindrical
harmonics instead of ellipses. All these normalized rotation descriptors allow
to reconstruct (decode) the approximated representation of the shape, hence can
be also used for lossy compression purposes.

the mechanics of elastic networks composed of stiff biopolymers. The underlying
network architecture is a key aspect that can affect the elastic properties of
these systems, which include rich linear and nonlinear elasticity. Existing
computational approaches have focused on both lattice-based and off-lattice
networks obtained from the random placement of rods. It is not obvious, a
priori, whether the two architectures have fundamentally similar or different
mechanics. If they are different, it is not clear which of these represents a
better model for biological networks. Here, we show that both approaches are
essentially equivalent for the same network connectivity, provided the networks
are sub-isostatic with respect to central force interactions. Moreover, for a
given sub-isostatic connectivity, we even find that lattice-based networks in
both 2D and 3D exhibit nearly identical nonlinear elastic response. We provide
a description of the linear mechanics for both architectures in terms of a
scaling function. We also show that the nonlinear regime is dominated by fiber
bending and that stiffening originates from the stabilization of sub-isostatic
networks by stress. We propose a generalized relation for this regime in terms
of the self-generated normal stresses that develop under deformation. Different
network architectures have different susceptibilities to the normal stress, but
essentially exhibit the same nonlinear mechanics. Such stiffening mechanism has
been shown to successfully capture the nonlinear mechanics of collagen
networks.

(Alternating Direction Implicit) solvers of higher orders of temporal accuracy
(orders $s = 2$ to $6$) for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in two-
and three-dimensional space. The proposed methodology employs the backward
differentiation formulae (BDF) together with a quasilinear-like formulation,
high-order extrapolation for nonlinear components, and the Douglas-Gunn
splitting. A variety of numerical results presented in Part I demonstrate in
practice the theoretical convergence rates enjoyed by these algorithms, as well
as their excellent accuracy and stability properties for a wide range of
Reynolds numbers. In particular, the proposed schemes enjoy a certain property
of ""quasi-unconditional stability"": for small enough (problem-dependent) fixed
values of the time-step $\Delta t$, these algorithms are stable for arbitrarily
fine spatial discretizations. The present contribution presents a mathematical
basis for the performance of these algorithms. Short of providing stability
theorems for the full BDF-ADI Navier-Stokes solvers, this paper puts forth
proofs of unconditional stability and quasi-unconditional stability for BDF-ADI
schemes as well as some related un-split BDF schemes, for a variety of related
linear model problems in one, two and three spatial dimensions, and for schemes
of orders $2\leq s\leq 6$ of temporal accuracy. Additionally, a set of
numerical tests presented in this paper for the compressible Navier-Stokes
equation indicate that quasi-unconditional stability carries over to the fully
non-linear context.

different dynamics. Through a full polarization analysis of the SHG signal,
symmetry considerations and density functional theory calculations, we show
that, in the non-equilibrium state, SHG is sensitive to {\em both} lattice

that different excited states couple to phonon modes of different symmetries.
Furthermore, the spin-scattering rate depends on the induced distortion,
enabling us to control the timescale for the demagnetization process. Our
results suggest that selective photoexcitation of antiferromagnetic insulators
allows fast and efficient manipulation of their magnetic state.

Specifically, we consider a network of base stations (BS) or access points (AP)

performance in terms of a) the outage probability and b) the error probability
of a victim receiver in the downlink of this wireless network. We derive
analytical expressions for both these metrics and discuss in detail how the
jammer network must adapt to the various wireless network parameters in order
to effectively attack the victim receivers. For instance, we will show that
with only 1 jammer per BS/AP a) the outage probability of the wireless network
can be increased from 1% (as seen in the non-jamming case) to 80% and b) when
retransmissions are used, the jammers cause the effective network activity
factor (and hence the interference among the BSs) to be doubled. Furthermore,
we show that the behavior of the jammer network as a function of the BS/AP
density is not obvious. In particular, an interesting concave-type behavior is
seen which indicates that the number of jammers required to attack the wireless
network must scale with the BS density only until a certain value beyond which
it decreases. In the context of error probability of the victim receiver, we
study whether or not some recent results related to jamming in the
point-to-point link scenario can be extended to the case of jamming against
wireless networks. Numerical results are presented to validate the theoretical
inferences presented.

The projected separation of $\sim$3.6' corresponds to $6656$ au, which is
unusually wide. The most recent published estimate of the age of the primary
combined with our own estimate based on newer isochrones yields an age of
$370-500$ Myr. The system therefore serves as a useful benchmark at an age
greater than that of the Pleiades brown dwarfs and most other young L dwarf
benchmarks. We have obtained a medium resolution echelle spectrum of the
companion which indicates a spectral type of L1.0$\pm$0.5 and lacks the typical
signatures of low surface gravity seen in younger brown dwarfs. This suggests
that signs of low surface gravity disappear from the spectra of early L dwarfs
by an age of $\sim370-500$ Myr, as expected from theoretical isochrones. The
mass of \beta{} Cir B is estimated from the BHAC15 isochrones as

feature of our work is to show that the shift is largely enhanced even when the
individual molecules couple with localized surface plasmons near the different
antennas. Specifically, we first consider the case that two sets of dimeric
gold blocks with a spacing of a few nanometer are arranged, and reveal that the
intensity and spectral peak of the optical absorption strongly depends on the
position of the molecules. In addition, when the dimeric blocks and the
molecules are periodically arranged, the peak shift is found to increase up to
~1.2 meV (300 GHz). Because the radiation-induced correlation is essential for
collective photon emission, our result implies the possibility of
plasmon-assisted superfluorescence in designed antenna-molecule complex
systems.

The regularization is obtained by leveraging on an extension of Calderon

discretized Huygens surfaces that can be consequently placed very near to the
radiating source. In addition, the new regularized scheme is hybridized with
both surfacic homogeneous and volumetric inhomogeneous forward BEM solvers

resolved H I survey of the Southern Hemisphere (the Galactic All-Sky Survey).
The overall Stream is structured into two filaments, suggesting two
ram-pressure tails lagging behind the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), and resembling
two close, transonic, von Karman vortex streets. The past motions of the Clouds
appear imprinted in them, implying almost parallel initial orbits, and then a
radical change after their passage near the N(H I) peak of the MS. This is
consistent with a recent collision between the MCs, $200-300$ Myr ago, which
has stripped their gas further into small clouds, spreading them out along a
gigantic bow shock, perpendicular to the MS. The Stream is formed by the
interplay between stellar feedback and the ram pressure exerted by hot gas in
the Milky Way (MW) halo with $\rho_{hot}$= $10^{-4}$ $cm^{-3}$ at 50-70 kpc, a
value necessary to explain the MS multiphase high-velocity clouds. The
corresponding hydrodynamic modeling provides the currently most accurate
reproduction of the whole H I Stream morphology, of its velocity, and column
density profiles along $L_{MS}$. The 'ram pressure plus collision' scenario
requires tidal dwarf galaxies, which are assumed to be the Cloud and dSph
progenitors, to have left imprints in the MS and the Leading Arm, respectively.
The simulated LMC and SMC have baryonic mass, kinematics and proper motions
consistent with observations. This supports a novel paradigm for the MS System,
which could have its origin in material expelled toward the MW by the ancient
gas-rich merger that formed M31.

(surface-sputtering) causes nano-ripples and quantum dots to self-organise on
the surfaces. The self-organisation had been shown, in some sputtering
experiments, to be influenced by unexpected contaminants (ions) from vacuum
walls. Existing inter-atomic-interaction potentials of Molecular Dynamics (MD)
simulations for studying this are unsuitable because they assume two-particle
collisions at a time instead of many (including contaminants)-particle
collisions (Wider-area Perturbations, (WP)). We designed this study to develop
a suitable potential that incorporates WP of the MD. We developed the general
potential to account for the possibility of WP due to contaminants (both
foreign and local to the material) consequently shifting the eqiulibrium points
of the MD the material. For instance, dynamics of Au and Fe were studied with O
bombardments/contamination (oxygenated environments), and those of CSiGe were
studied with W, Ti, and O. It was found that the phase-shift, of the
eqiulibrium points of the MD simulations, for Au stabilised for just five atoms
of oxygen while that of Fe did not, when interacting in separate oxygenated
environments. A different phase shift was recorded for CSiGe which reflected
the usage of different contaminants, under subsequent bombardments with W, Ti
and O, in transformations to CSiGeW, CSiGeWTi, and CSiGeWTiO. These results and
those for the sampled superconducting materials, such as SrNdCuO and LiFeAs,
showed a sensitivity of the general potential, and insensitivity of the
existing potentials, to the type and environment of the atoms of these
materials. Furthermore, results obtained clearly show that the MD perturbations
in a material, via its surface, is peculiar to the surface.
