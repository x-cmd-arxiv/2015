alter the cross section. However in a large set of composite Higgs models and
in realistic areas of the MSSM parameter space, these two effects can conspire
and hide new physics in a Standard Model-like inclusive cross section. We first
show that it is possible to break this degeneracy in the couplings by demanding
a boosted Higgs recoiling against a high-$p_T$ jet. Subsequently we propose an
analysis based on this idea in the $H\to2\ell+E\!\!/_T$ channels. This
measurement allows an alternative determination of the important top Yukawa
besides the $t\bar t H$ channel.

motion following a parabolic path, which differs from the classical motion just
because of wave packet spreading (quantum diffusion). However, when a periodic
potential is added (such as in a crystal) the particle undergoes Bragg
scattering and an oscillatory (rather than accelerated) motion is found,
corresponding to the famous Bloch oscillations. Here we introduce an
exactly-solvable quantum Hamiltonian model, corresponding to a generalized
Wannier-Stark Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$, in which a quantum particle shows an
intermediate dynamical behavior, namely an oscillatory motion superimposed to
an accelerated one. Such a novel dynamical behavior is referred to as {\it
accelerated Bloch oscillations}. Analytical expressions of the spectrum,
improper eigenfunctions and propagator of the generalized Wannier-Stark
Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ are derived. Finally, it is shown that acceleration and
quantum diffusion in the generalized Wannier-Stark Hamiltonian are prevented
for Airy wave packets, which undergo a periodic breathing dynamics that can be
referred to as {\it Airy-Bloch oscillations}.

the union of two embedded smooth curves. We will explain how the trajectories
of the bodies in the solutions coming from one of the embedded curves have two
symmetries while those coming from the other embedded curve only have one
symmetry. The Round Taylor Method is a numerical method implemented by the

include analysis of the error of the solutions using the Round Taylor Method.

be controlled, investigate and try to control the variability of the response
variable is very important for quality improvement in industrial processes.
Thus, modeling the variability in mixture experiments with noise variables
becomes necessary and has been considered in literature with approaches that
require the choice of a quadratic loss function or by using the delta method.
In this paper, we make use of the delta method and also propose an alternative
approach, which is based on the Joint Modeling of Mean and Dispersion (JMMD).
We consider a mixture experiment involving noise variables and we use the
techniques of JMMD and of the delta method to get models for both mean and
variance of the response variable. Following the Taguchi's ideas about robust
parameter design we build and solve an optimization problem for minimizing the
variance while holding the mean on the target. At the end we provide a
discussion about the two methodologies considered.

the half maximum in experimental cross sections, and hence the extracted GDR

simulate the in-line hologram of the created object set; when such a hologram
is contrast inverted, thus giving rise to a diffractor, it creates the
pre-determined three-dimensional path of intensity behind the diffractor under

of the predetermined curves, which is given by the lateral and axial resolution
of the optical system. We provide both, simulated and experimental results to

multi-commodity traffic. The resulting model is called the Link-Node CTM
(LNCTM).
  In the LNCTM, we use the fundamental diagram of an ""inverse lambda"" shape
that allows modeling of the capacity drop and the hysteresis behavior of the
traffic state in a link that goes from free flow to congestion and back.
  A model of the node with multiple input and multiple output links accepting
multi-commodity traffic is a cornerstone of the LNCTM. We present the
multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) node model for multi-commodity traffic that
supersedes previously developed node models. The analysis and comparison with
previous node models are provided.
  Sometimes, certain traffic commodities may choose between multiple output
links in a node based on the current traffic state of the node's input and
output links. For such situations, we propose a local traffic assignment
algorithm that computes how incoming traffic of a certain commodity should be
distributed between output links, if this information is not known a priori.

conditions of star formation, as they shed light on the environment they were

than in higher density ones. In the current debate about the formation of
Globular Clusters and their multiple populations, studying the binary incidence
in the populations they host offers a crucial piece of information on the
environment of their birth and their subsequent dynamical evolution.
  Through a multi-year observational campaign using FLAMES at VLT, we monitored
the radial velocity of 968 Red-Giant Branch stars located around the half-light
radii in a sample of 10 Galactic Globular Clusters. We found a total of 21
radial velocity variables identified as {\it bona fide} binary stars, for a
binary fraction of 2.2%$\pm$0.5%. When separating the sample into first
generation and second generation stars, we find a binary fraction of
4.9%$\pm$1.3% and 1.2%$\pm$0.4% respectively. Through simulations that take
into account possible sources of bias in detecting radial velocity variations
in the two populations, we show that the difference is significant and only
marginally affected by such effects.
  Such a different binary fraction strongly suggests different conditions in
the environment of formation and evolution of first and second generations
stars, with the latter being born in a much denser environment. Our result
hence strongly supports the idea that the second generation forms in a dense
subsystem at the center of the loosely distributed first generation, where
(loose) binaries are efficiently destroyed.

units to capture long temporal dependencies. We train our architecture in a
sequence-to-sequence prediction manner, and it explicitly learns to predict the

layer for anticipation which prevents over-fitting and encourages early
anticipation. We use our architecture to anticipate driving maneuvers several
seconds before they happen on a natural driving data set of 1180 miles. The
context for maneuver anticipation comes from multiple sensors installed on the
vehicle. Our approach shows significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
in maneuver anticipation by increasing the precision from 77.4% to 90.5% and

a new window in the study of high-energy astrophysical sources. Among them,
neutron stars appear particularly suited for polarization measurements.
Radiation from the (cooling) surface of a neutron star is expected to exhibit a
large intrinsic polarization degree due to the star strong magnetic field
($\approx 10^{12}-10^{15}$ G), which influences the plasma opacity in the
outermost stellar layers. The polarization fraction and polarization angle as
measured by an instrument, however, do not necessary coincide with the
intrinsic ones derived from models of surface emission. This is due to the
effects of quantum electrodynamics in the highly magnetized vacuum around the
star (the vacuum polarization) coupled with the rotation of the Stokes
parameters in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight induced by the
non-uniform magnetic field. Here we revisit the problem and present an
efficient method for computing the observed polarization fraction and
polarization angle in the case of radiation coming from the entire surface of a
neutron star, accounting for both vacuum polarization and geometrical effects
due to the extended emitting region. Our approach is fairly general and is
illustrated in the case of blackbody emission from a neutron star with either a
dipolar or a (globally) twisted magnetic field.

AdS$_3$. The initially static string stretches between two antipodal points on
the boundary circle. Both endpoints are perturbed which creates cusps at a
steady rate. The cusps propagate towards the interior where they collide. The
behavior of the string depends on the strength of forcing. Three qualitatively
different phases can be distinguished: transparent, gray, and black. The
transparent region is analogous to a standing wave. In the black phase, there
is a horizon on the worldsheet and cusps never reach the other endpoint. The
string keeps folding and its length grows linearly over time. In the gray
phase, the string still grows linearly. However, cusps do cross to the other
side. The transparent and gray regions are separated by a transition point
where a logarithmic accumulation of cusps is numerically observed. A simple
model reproduces the qualitative behavior of the string in the three phases.

combine our IFU data with a subsample of galaxies from the ALFALFA HI survey
crossmatched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study the FMR$_{\text{SFR}}$

1$\sigma$ mean scatter in the MZR to be 0.05 dex. The 1$\sigma$ mean scatter in
the FMR$_{\text{SFR}}$ (0.02 dex) is significantly lower than that of the MZR.
The FMR$_{\text{SFR}}$ is not consistent between the IFU observed galaxies and
the ALFALFA/SDSS galaxies for SFRs lower than 10$^{-2.4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$,
however this could be the result of limitations of our measurements in that
regime. The lowest mean scatter (0.01 dex) is found in the FMR$_{\text{HI}}$.
We also find that the FMR$_{\text{HI}}$ is consistent between the IFU observed
dwarf galaxies and the ALFALFA/SDSS crossmatched sample. We introduce the
fundamental metallicity luminosity counterpart to the FMR, again characterized
in terms of SFR (FML$_{\text{SFR}}$) and HI-gas mass (FML$_{\text{HI}}$). We
find that the FML$_{\text{HI}}$ relation is consistent between the IFU observed
dwarf galaxy sample and the larger ALFALFA/SDSS sample. However the 1$\sigma$

regions in which the gas is ionized, beyond which are photodissociation regions
(PDRs) in which the gas transitions to its atomic and molecular form. Several
numerical codes have been implemented to study these two main phases of the

TORUS-3DPDR, a new self-consistent code for treating the chemistry of
three-dimensional photoionization and photodissociation regions. It is an
integrated code coupling the two codes TORUS, a hydrodynamics and Monte Carlo
radiation transport code, and 3D-PDR, a photodissociation regions code. The new
code uses a Monte Carlo radiative transfer scheme to account for the
propagation of the ionizing radiation including the diffusive component as well
as a ray-tracing scheme based on the HEALPix package in order to account for
the escape probability and column density calculations. Here, we present the
numerical techniques we followed and we show the capabilities of the new code

discuss the effects introduced by the diffusive component of the UV field in
determining the thermal balance of PDRs as well as the effects introduced by a

radiation can positively contribute to the formation of CO. With this new code,
three-dimensional synthetic observations for the major cooling lines are

Thus, Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) models that assign galaxies to halos
based on halo mass are frequently used to interpret clustering observations,
even though it is well-known that the assembly history of dark matter halos is
related to their clustering. In this paper we use high-resolution
hydrodynamical cosmological simulations to compare the halo and stellar mass
growth of galaxies in a large-scale overdensity to those in a large-scale
underdensity (on scales of about 20 Mpc). The simulation reproduces assembly
bias, that halos have earlier formation times in overdense environments than in
underdense regions. We find that the stellar mass to halo mass ratio is larger
in overdense regions in central galaxies residing in halos with masses between
10$^{11}$-10$^{12.9}$ M$_{\odot}$. When we force the local density (within 2
Mpc) at z=0 to be the same for galaxies in the large-scale over- and
underdensities, we find the same results. We posit that this difference can be
explained by a combination of earlier formation times, more interactions at
early times with neighbors, and more filaments feeding galaxies in overdense
regions. This result puts the standard practice of assigning stellar mass to
halos based only on their mass, rather than considering their larger
environment, into question.

smaller than what one gets for quenches in holographic theories, which
highlights the importance of interactions in the spread of entanglement in
many-body systems. We propose an interacting model which we believe provides an
upper bound on the spread of entanglement for interacting relativistic
theories. In two spacetime dimensions with multiple intervals, this model and
its variations are able to reproduce intricate results exhibited by holographic

in the theory of star formation. It is generally fit with a composite power
law. Some clues on the progenitors can be found in dense starless cores that
have a core mass function (CMF) with a similar shape. In the low-mass end,
these mass functions increase with mass, albeit the sample may be somewhat
incomplete; in the high-mass end, the mass functions decrease with mass. There
is an offset in the turn-over mass between the two mass distributions. The
stellar mass for the IMF peak is lower than the corresponding core mass for the
CMF peak in the Pipe Nebula by about a factor of three. Smaller offsets are
found between the IMF and the CMFs in other nebulae. We suggest that the offset
is likely induced during a starburst episode of global star formation which is
triggered by the formation of a few O/B stars in the multi-phase media, which
naturally emerged through the onset of thermal instability in the cloud-core
formation process. We consider the scenario that the ignition of a few massive
stars photoionizes the warm medium between the cores, increases the external
pressure, reduces their Bonnor?Ebert mass, and triggers the collapse of some
previously stable cores. We quantitatively reproduce the IMF in the low-mass
end with the assumption of additional rotational fragmentation.

surface tension in the simulation using standard SPH. This affects the
efficiency with which AGN activity can quench star formation in these galaxies

lensing measures galaxy shapes, which are the consequence of both the intrinsic
ellipticity of the sources and of the integrated gravitational lensing effect
along the line of sight. Hence, a very large number of galaxies is required in
order to average over their individual properties and to isolate the weak
lensing cosmic shear signal. If this `shape noise' can be reduced, significant
advances in the power of a weak lensing surveys can be expected. This paper
describes a general method for extracting the probability distributions of
parameters from catalogues of data using Voronoi cells, which has several
applications, and has synergies with Bayesian hierarchical modelling
approaches. This allows us to construct a probability distribution for the
variance of the intrinsic ellipticity as a function of galaxy property using
only photometric data, allowing a reduction of shape noise. As a proof of
concept the method is applied to the CFHTLenS survey data. We use this approach

obtained in micromagnetic simulations propagate over distances of several
micrometers. The proposed approach requires neither inhomogeneity of the

be explained by invoking some energy source beyond gravitational contraction.
This paper investigates whether Centaur impacts could provide the energy
necessary to produce the luminosity of Neptune. The major findings are (1) that
impacts on both Uranus and Neptune are too infrequent to provide luminosities
of order the observed value for Neptune, even for optimistic impact-rate
estimates, and (2) that Uranus and Neptune rarely have significantly different
impact-generated luminosities at any given time. Uranus and Neptune most likely
have structural differences that force them to cool and contract at different

works with overlapping coordinate charts as a description of the given

the discontinuous material interface in a high-order manner, a specialized

evaluation of large number of interactions that arise in the approximation of
the volumetric integral operator and thus achieves a reduced computational
complexity of $O(N \log N)$ for an $N$-point discretization. A detailed

edge-colored undirected graphs, are of central interest, e.g.\ in
phylogenomics. In this context symbolic ultrametrics play a crucial role.
Symbolic ultrametrics define an edge-colored complete graph that allows to
represent the topology of this graph as a vertex-colored tree. Here, we are
interested in the structure and the complexity of certain combinatorial
problems resulting from considerations based on symbolic ultrametrics, and on
algorithms to solve them.
  This includes, the characterization of symbolic ultrametrics that
additionally distinguishes between edges and non-edges of \emph{arbitrary}
edge-colored graphs $G$ and thus, yielding a tree representation of $G$, by
means of so-called cographs. Moreover, we address the problem of finding
""closest"" symbolic ultrametrics and show the NP-completeness of the three
problems: symbolic ultrametric editing, completion and deletion. Finally, as
not all graphs are cographs, and hence, don't have a tree representation, we
ask, furthermore, what is the minimum number of cotrees needed to represent the
topology of an arbitrary non-cograph $G$. This is equivalent to find an optimal
cograph edge $k$-decomposition $\{E_1,\dots,E_k\}$ of $E$ so that each subgraph
$(V,E_i)$ of $G$ is a cograph. We investigate this problem in full detail,
resulting in several new open problems, and NP-hardness results.
  For all optimization problems proven to be NP-hard we will provide integer

equations, via global bifurcation from the spherical state. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first rigorous existence results for this class
of problems. We overcome several difficulties in carrying this out. Due to
inherent surface fluidity combined with finite curvature elasticity, neither
the Eulerian (spatial) nor the Lagrangian (material) description of the model
lends itself well to analysis. This is resolved via a singularity-free
radial-map description, which effectively eliminates the grossly
underdetermined in-plane deformation. The resulting governing equations
comprise a quasi-linear elliptic system with nonlinear constraints. We show the
equivalence of the problem to that of finding the zeros of compact vector
field. The latter is not routine. Using spectral and a-priori estimates
together with Fredholm properties, we demonstrate that the principal part of
the quasi-linear mapping defines an operator with compact resolvent. We then
combine well known group-theoretic ideas for symmetry breaking with global

quite broad, and sometimes multi-peaked and quite sensitive to the choice of

binary-binary encounters in the dense cores of globular clusters. In a
sufficiently inclined triple, gravitational interactions between the inner and
outer binary can cause large-amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of the
inner orbit (""Lidov-Kozai cycles""), which can lead to a collision and merger of
the two inner components. In this paper we use Monte Carlo models of dense star
clusters to identify all triple systems formed dynamically and we compute their
evolution using a highly accurate three-body integrator which incorporates
relativistic and tidal effects. We find that a large fraction of these triples
evolve through a non-secular dynamical phase which can drive the inner binary
to higher eccentricities than predicted by the standard secular perturbation
theory (even including octupole-order terms). We place constraints on the
importance of Lidov-Kozai-induced mergers for producing: (i) gravitational wave
sources detectable by Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), for triples with an inner pair of
stellar black holes; and (ii) blue straggler stars, for triples with
main-sequence-star components. We find a realistic aLIGO detection rate of
black hole mergers due to the Lidov-Kozai mechanism of 1yr^-1, with about 20%
of these having a finite eccentricity when they first chirp into the aLIGO
frequency band. While rare, these events are likely to dominate among eccentric
compact object inspirals that are potentially detectable by aLIGO. For blue
stragglers, we find that the Lidov-Kozai mechanism can contribute only up to
~10% of their total numbers in globular clusters.

viscoplastic flow problems without prior regularisation. Compared to the
widespread alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM / ALG2), the new
method features three key advantages: firstly, it accelerates the worst-case
convergence rate from $O(1/\sqrt{k})$ to $O(1/k)$, where $k$ is the iteration
counter. Secondly, even for nonlinear constitutive models like those of Casson
or Herschel-Bulkley, no nonlinear systems of equations have to be solved in the
subproblems of the algorithm. Thirdly, there is no need to augment the
Lagrangian, which eliminates the difficulty of choosing a penalty parameter
heuristically.
  In this paper, we transform the usual velocity-based formulation of
viscoplastic flow problems to a dual formulation in terms of the stress. For
the numerical solution of this dual problem we apply FISTA, an accelerated
first-order optimisation algorithm from the class of so-called proximal
gradient methods. Finally, we conduct a series of numerical experiments,
focussing on stationary flow in two-dimensional square cavities.
  Our results confirm that Algorithm FISTA*, the new dual-based FISTA,
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as ADMM / ALG2 by several orders
of magnitude. We demonstrate how this speedup can be exploited to identify the
free boundary between yielded and unyielded regions with previously unknown
accuracy. Since the accelerated algorithm relies solely on Stokes-type
subproblems and nonlinear function evaluations, existing code based on
augmented Lagrangians would require only few minor adaptations to obtain an
implementation of FISTA*.

measurement matrices in compressive sensing, to spherical codes for data
compression and data transmission, to spacetime codes for MIMO communications,
and to measurement operators in quantum sensing. High-performance codes usually
arise from designing frames whose elements have mutually low coherence.
Building off the original ""group frame"" design of Slepian which has since been
elaborated in the works of Vale and Waldron, we present several new frame
constructions based on cyclic and generalized dihedral groups. Slepian's
original construction was based on the premise that group structure allows one
to reduce the number of distinct inner pairwise inner products in a frame with
$n$ elements from $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ to $n-1$. All of our constructions further
utilize the group structure to produce tight frames with even fewer distinct
inner product values between the frame elements. When $n$ is prime, for
example, we use cyclic groups to construct $m$-dimensional frame vectors with
at most $\frac{n-1}{m}$ distinct inner products. We use this behavior to bound
the coherence of our frames via arguments based on the frame potential, and
derive even tighter bounds from combinatorial and algebraic arguments using the
group structure alone. In certain cases, we recover well-known Welch bound
achieving frames. In cases where the Welch bound has not been achieved, and is
not known to be achievable, we obtain frames with close to Welch bound
performance.

we collect a sample of XRBs and low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs)
with wide distribution of Eddington ratios to reexplore the fundamental plane
between 5 GHz radio luminosity, $L_{\rm R}$, 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity, $L_{\rm

we confirm the former fundamental plane of Merloni et al. and Falcke et al.
that $\xi_{\rm X}\sim 0.6$ and $\xi_{\rm M}\sim 0.8$ even after including more
quiescent BHs. The quiescent BHs follow the fundamental plane very well, and,
however, FR I radio galaxies follow a steeper track comparing other BH sources.
After excluding FR Is, we investigate the fundamental plane for BHs in
quiescent state with $L_{\rm X}< L_{\rm X,c}$ and sub-Eddington BHs with
$L_{\rm X}> L_{\rm X,c}$ respectively, and both subsamples have a similar
slope, $\xi_{\rm X}\sim0.6$, which support that quiescent BHs may behave
similar to those in low-hard state. We further select two subsamples of AGNs
with BH mass in a narrow range (FR Is with $M_{\rm BH}=10^{8.8\pm0.4}$ and
other LLAGNs with $M_{\rm BH}=10^{8.0\pm0.4}$) to simulate the behavior of a
single supermassive BH evolving from sub-Eddington to quiescent state. We find
that the highly sub-Eddington sources with $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm

correlation as defined by other sub-Eddington BHs. Our results are consistent
with several recent observations in XRBs that the radio--X-ray correlation as

also show that the training time optimization problem can be formulated as a

constant problem can be dynamically solved by specific compactifications of
gravity from higher-dimensional toy models. These models have the novel feature
that in the four-dimensional theory, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is
much smaller than the Planck density and in fact accumulates at $\Lambda=0$.
Here we show that while these are very interesting models, they do not properly
address the real cosmological constant problem. As we explain, the real problem
is not simply to obtain $\Lambda$ that is small in Planck units in a toy model,
but to explain why $\Lambda$ is much smaller than other mass scales (and
combinations of scales) in the theory. Instead, in these toy models, all other
particle mass scales have been either removed or sent to zero, thus ignoring
the real problem. To this end, we provide a general argument that the included
moduli masses are generically of order Hubble, so sending them to zero
trivially sends the cosmological constant to zero. We also show that the
fundamental Planck mass is being sent to zero, and so the central problem is
trivially avoided by removing high energy physics altogether. On the other
hand, by including various large mass scales from particle physics with a high
fundamental Planck mass, one is faced with a real problem, whose only known
solution involves accidental cancellations in a landscape.

to the classical derivative as a nonlocality parameter vanishes. Using Fourier
transforms, we find the general solution to the integral equation. We show that
the nonlocal antiderivative involves an infinite dimensional set of functions

regression (MR), quantile regression (QR) can characterize the entire
conditional distribution of the outcome variable, and is more robust to
outliers and misspecification of the error distribution. We present a
likelihood-based approach to the estimation of the regression quantiles based
on the asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD), which has a hierarchical
representation that facilitates the implementation of the EM algorithm for the
maximum-likelihood estimation. We develop a case-deletion diagnostic analysis
for QR models based on the conditional expectation of the complete-data

not on software bugs, but on configuration bugs. To cope, thousands of
organizations use system configuration languages to manage their computing
infrastructure. Of these, Puppet is the most widely used with thousands of
paying customers and many more open-source users. The heart of Puppet is a
domain-specific language that describes the state of a system. Puppet already
performs some basic static checks, but they only prevent a narrow range of
errors. Furthermore, testing is ineffective because many errors are only
triggered under specific machine states that are difficult to predict and
reproduce. With several examples, we show that a key problem with Puppet is
that configurations can be non-deterministic.
  This paper presents Rehearsal, a verification tool for Puppet configurations.
Rehearsal implements a sound, complete, and scalable determinacy analysis for
Puppet. To develop it, we (1) present a formal semantics for Puppet, (2) use
several analyses to shrink our models to a tractable size, and (3) frame
determinism-checking as decidable formulas for an SMT solver. Rehearsal then
leverages the determinacy analysis to check other important properties, such as
idempotency. Finally, we apply Rehearsal to several real-world Puppet
configurations.

cylinder is studied theoretically. Attention is given to the onset of
non-Newtonian free-surface instability in creeping flow. This non-inertial
instability has been observed in experiments, but current theoretical models of
Newtonian fluids can neither describe its origin nor explain its onset. This
study examines two models of non Newtonian fluids to see if the experimentally
observed instability can be predicted analytically. The non-Newtonian viscosity
and elastic properties of the fluid are described by the Generalized Newtonian
Fluid (GNF) and Second Order Viscoelastic Fluid (SOVF) constitutive models,
respectively. With linear stability analysis, it is found that, analogously to
the Newtonian fluid, rimming flow of viscous non-Newtonian fluids (modeled by
GNF) is neutrally stable. However, the viscoelastic properties of the fluid
(modeled by SOVF) are found to contribute to the flow destabilization. The
instability is shown to increase as the cylinder rotation rate is lowered, from
which the fluid accumulates in a pool on the rising wall. Viscoelastic effects
coupled with this pooling cause the fluid's angular stretching, which is
suggested to be responsible for this onset of instability.

power from photogenerated electron-hole pairs before they thermalize with the
lattice, and thus potentially offer higher power conversion efficiency compared
to conventional, single absorber solar cells. The efficiency of hot-carrier
solar cells can be expected to strongly depend on the details of the energy
filtering process, a relationship which to date has not been satisfactorily
explored. Here, we establish the conditions under which electron-hole
separation in hot-carrier solar cells can occur reversibly, that is, at maximum
energy conversion efficiency. We thus focus our analysis on the internal
operation of the hot-carrier solar cell itself, and in this work do not
consider the photon-mediated coupling to the sun. After deriving an expression
for the voltage of a hot-carrier solar cell valid under conditions of both
reversible and irreversible electrical operation, we identify separate
contributions to the voltage from the thermoelectric effect and the
photovoltaic effect. We find that, under specific conditions, the energy
conversion efficiency of a hot-carrier solar cell can exceed the Carnot limit
set by the intra-device temperature gradient alone, due to the additional
contribution of the quasi-Fermi level splitting in the absorber. We also
establish that the open-circuit voltage of a hot-carrier solar cell is not
limited by the band gap of the absorber, due to the additional thermoelectric
contribution to the voltage. Additionally, we find that a hot-carrier solar
cell can be operated in reverse as a thermally driven solid-state light
emitter. Our results help explore the fundamental limitations of hot-carrier
solar cells, and provide a first step towards providing experimentalists with a
guide to the optimal configuration of devices.

unweighted estimation algorithm, and analyze asymptotic behaviors of their

probability by making use of the asymptotic results. On the basis of the
criterion, we provide two novel subsampling methods, the optimal subsampling
and the predictor- length subsampling methods. The predictor-length subsampling
method is based on the L2 norm of predictors rather than leverage scores. Its
computational cost is scalable. For unweighted estimation algorithm, we show
that its resulting subsample estimator is not consistent to the full sample OLS

distribution function of beta density or as the Gauss hypergeometric function
with one of the upper parameters equal to unity. Logarithmic
concavity/convexity of this function in parameters was established by Finner
and Roters in 1997. Their proof is indirect and rather difficult; it is based
on generalized reproductive property of certain more general distributions.
These authors remark that these results ""seems to be very hard to obtain by
usual analytic methods"". In the first part of this paper we provide such proof
based on standard tools of analysis. In the second part we go one step further
and investigate the sign of generalized Tur\'{a}n determinants formed by shifts
of the normalized incomplete beta function. Under some additional restrictions
we demonstrate that these coefficients are of the same sign. We further
conjecture that such restrictions can be removed without altering the results.
Our method of proof also leads to various companion results which may be of
independent interest. In particular, we establish linearization formulas and
two-sided bounds for the above mentioned Tur\'{a}n determinants. Further, we
find two combinatorial style identities for finite sums which we believe to be

been debated as much as the eclipsed and staggered ferrocene conformers. The
present quantum mechanical study reveals that removal of an electron does not
apparently affect the geometry and symmetry of the cation, as the geometric
changes are < 2% with respect to neutral Fc, but produce the fingerprint
orbital 8a1 of Fc+. The excess orbital energy spectrum (EOES) of the \alpha-
and \beta-electrons reveals that the electrons originated from the transition
metal Fe in both core and valence shells experience significant energy changes
in the cation with respect to the neutral ferrocene counterparts, indicating
that the Fe-electrons correlate stronger than electrons from other atoms such
as carbons in ferrocene. The EOES also exhibits that the orbital energies of
the \alpha-electrons in ferrocenium change more significantly than the
\beta-electrons after one \beta-electron being ionized with respect to
ferrocene. The most significant changes upon ionization are dominated by the
Fe-electrons in non-degenerate signature orbitals. That is, 4a1 which is
dominated by the Fe 3s orbital, 3a2 by the Fe 3pz orbital and the 8a1 orbital
(alpha only) by the Fe 3dz2 (one beta-electron is removed from this orbital).
The \Delta DFT and \Delta SCF calculations yield the IP of 6.90 eV and 6.85 eV,
respectively, in excellent agreement to the recent measurements of 6.9 \pn 0.1
eV, suggesting that significant relaxation energy exists whereas electron
correlation energies are largely cancelled out. A further dual space analysis
(DSA) identifies that the momentum profiles of such the singly occupied
fingerprint 8a1 orbital indeed experiences most significant changes in all
orbitals of Fc+, again indicates that the electron removal of ferrocene
ionization is not from the highest occupied molecular orbital.

quantum feedback. As the first step in exploring observer-based coherent

using coherent observers, and in such a fashion, poles of a closed-loop quantum
system can be relocated at any desired locations. In comparison to classical
feedback control design incorporating the Luenberger observer, here direct
coupling between a quantum plant and the observer-based controller are allowed
to enable a greater degree of freedom for the design of controller parameters.
A separation principle is presented, and we show how to design the observer and

proposed scheme is applicable to coherent feedback control of quantum systems,
especially when the transient dynamic response is of interest, and this issue
is illustrated in an example.

microwave frequencies from interactions of high-energy electrons produced in
annihilation with the Galactic magnetic fields has attracted much interest in
recent years. We investigate the DM interpretation of the Galactic Center
gamma-ray excess by searching for the associated synchrotron in the WMAP-Planck

predict the synchrotron emission due to DM annihilation in our Galaxy, and
compare it with the WMAP-Planck data at 23-70GHz. In addition to standard
microwave foregrounds, we separately model the microwave counterpart to the
Fermi Bubbles and the signal due to DM, and use component separation techniques
to extract the signal associated with each template from the total emission. We
confirm the presence of the Haze at the level of 7% of the total sky intensity
at 23GHz in our chosen region of interest, with a harder spectrum $I \sim
\nu^{-0.8}$ than the synchrotron from regular cosmic-ray electrons. The data do
not show a strong preference towards fitting the Haze by either the Bubbles or
DM emission only. Inclusion of both components provides a better fit with a DM
contribution to the Haze emission of 20% at 23GHz, however, due to significant
uncertainties in foreground modeling, we do not consider this a clear detection
of a DM signal. We set robust upper limits on the annihilation cross section by
ignoring foregrounds, and also report best-fit DM annihilation parameters
obtained from a complete template analysis. We conclude that the WMAP-Planck

behavior of multiscale composites containing nano- and micro-scale
reinforcements. The distinctive feature of construction of this composite is
such that the carbon nanostructures (CNS) are dispersed in the matrix around
the continuous microscale fiber to modify microfiber-matrix interfacial
adhesion. Such CNS are considered to be made of aligned CNTs (A-CNTs).
Accordingly, multiscale models are developed for such hybrid composites. First,
molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the Mori-Tanaka method are
used to determine the effective elastic properties of nano-engineered
interphase layer composed of CNS and epoxy. Subsequently, a micromechanical
pull-out model for a continuous fiber multi-scale composite is developed, and
stress transfer behavior is studied for different orientations of CNS
considering their perfect and imperfect interfacial bonding conditions with the
surrounding epoxy. Such interface condition was modeled using the linear spring
layer model with a continuous traction but a displacement jump. The current
pull-out model accounts for the radial as well as the axial deformations of
different orthotropic constituent phases of the multiscale composite. The
results from the developed pull-out model are compared with those of the finite
element analyses and are found to be in good agreement. Our results reveal that
the stress transfer characteristics of the multiscale composite are
significantly improved by controlling the CNT morphology around the fiber,
particularly, when they are aligned along the axial direction of the microscale
fiber. The results also show that the CNS-epoxy interface weakening
significantly influences the radial stress along the length of the microscale
fiber.

  Disjunctive Programming","8 pages with 5 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An optimization problem considering AC power flow constraints and integer
decision variables can usually be posed as a mixed-integer quadratically
constrained quadratic program (MIQCQP) problem. In this paper, first, a set of
valid linear equalities are applied to strengthen the semidefinite program
(SDP) relaxation of the MIQCQP problem without significantly increasing the
problem dimension so that an enhanced mixed-integer SDP (MISDP) relaxation,
which is a mixed-integer convex problem, is obtained. Then, the enhanced MISDP
relaxation is reformulated as a disjunctive programming (DP) problem which is
tighter than the former one, since the disjunctions are designed to capture the
disjunctive nature of the terms in the rank-1 constraint about the integral
variables. The DP relaxation is then equivalently convert-ed back into a MISDP
problem the feasible set of whose continu-ous relaxation is the convex hull of
feasible region of the DP prob-lem. Finally, globally optimal solution of the
DP problem which is the tightest relaxation for the MIQCQP proposed in the
paper is obtained by solving the resulting MISDP problem using a
branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm. Computational efficiency of the B&B algorithm
is expected to be high since feasible set of the continuous relaxation of a
MISDP sub-problem is the convex hull of that of the corresponding DP
sub-problem. To further reduce the dimension of the resulting MISDP problem, a
compact for-mulation of this problem is proposed considering the sparsity. An
optimal placement problem of smart PV inverter in distribution systems
integrated with high penetration of PV, which is an MIQCQP problem, is studied
as an example. The proposed ap-proach is tested on an IEEE distribution system.
The results show that it can effectively improve the tightness and feasibility
of the SDP relaxation.

in the application of Gaussian Processes to regression tasks is that the
computation of the solution requires performing a matrix inversion. The
solution also requires the storage of a large matrix in memory. These factors
restrict the application of Gaussian Process regression to small and moderate
size data sets. We present an algorithm that combines estimates from models
developed using subsets of the data obtained in a manner similar to the
bootstrap. The sample size is a critical parameter for this algorithm.
Guidelines for reasonable choices of algorithm parameters, based on detailed
experimental study, are provided. Various techniques have been proposed to
scale Gaussian Processes to large scale regression tasks. The most appropriate
choice depends on the problem context. The proposed method is most appropriate
for problems where an additive model works well and the response depends on a
small number of features. The minimax rate of convergence for such problems is
attractive and we can build effective models with a small subset of the data.
The Stochastic Variational Gaussian Process and the Sparse Gaussian Process are
also appropriate choices for such problems. These methods pick a subset of data
based on theoretical considerations. The proposed algorithm uses bagging and
random sampling. Results from experiments conducted as part of this study
indicate that the algorithm presented in this work can be as effective as these
methods. Model stacking can be used to combine the model developed with the
proposed method with models from other methods for large scale regression such
as Gradient Boosted Trees. This can yield performance gains.

star-forming galaxies at redshifts z = 3-6 in an ultradeep exposure of the
Hubble Deep Field South obtained with MUSE on the ESO-VLT. The data reach a
limiting surface brightness (1sigma) of ~1 x 10^-19 erg s^-1 cm^-2 arcsec^-2 in
azimuthally averaged radial profiles, an order of magnitude improvement over
previous narrowband imaging. Our sample consists of 26 spectroscopically
confirmed Ly alpha-emitting, but mostly continuum-faint (m_AB >~ 27) galaxies.
In most objects the Ly alpha emission is considerably more extended than the UV
continuum light. While 5 of the faintest galaxies in the sample show no
significantly detected Ly alpha haloes, the derived upper limits suggest that
this is just due to insufficient S/N. Ly alpha haloes therefore appear to be
(nearly) ubiquitous even for low-mass (~10^8-10^9 M_sun) star-forming galaxies
at z>3. We decompose the Ly alpha emission of each object into a compact
`continuum-like' and an extended halo component, and infer sizes and
luminosities of the haloes. The extended Ly alpha emission approximately
follows an exponential surface brightness distribution with a scale length of a
few kpc. While these haloes are thus quite modest in terms of their absolute
sizes, they are larger by a factor of 5-15 than the corresponding rest-frame UV
continuum sources as seen by HST. They are also much more extended, by a factor
~5, than Ly alpha haloes around low-redshift star-forming galaxies. Between
~40% and >90% of the observed Ly alpha flux comes from the extended halo
component, with no obvious correlation of this fraction with either the
absolute or the relative size of the Ly alpha halo. Our observations provide
direct insights into the spatial distribution of at least partly neutral gas
residing in the circumgalactic medium of low to intermediate mass galaxies at z
> 3.

matter, to the extent that they are important for the chemical evolution of,
and dust production in, the universe. The mass loss is believed to increase
gradually with age on the AGB, but it may also occur in the form of bursts,
possibly related to the thermal pulsing phenomenon. Detached, geometrically
thin, CO shells around carbon stars are good signposts of brief and intense
mass ejection. We aim to put further constraints on the physical properties of
detached CO shells around AGB stars. The photodissociation of CO and other
carbon-bearing species in the shells leads to the possibility of detecting
lines from neutral carbon. We have therefore searched for the
CI($^3P_1-\,^3P_0$) line at 492 GHz towards two carbon stars, S Sct and R Scl,
with detached CO shells of different ages, about 8000 and 2300 years,
respectively. The CI($^3P_1-\,^3P_0$) line was detected towards R Scl. The line
intensity is dominated by emission from the detached shell. The detection is at
a level consistent with the neutral carbon coming from the full
photodissociation of all species except CO, and with only limited
photoionisation of carbon. The best fit to the observed $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO
line intensities, assuming a homogeneous shell, is obtained for a shell mass of
about 0.002 $M_\odot$, a temperature of about 100 K, and a CO abundance with
respect to H$_2$ of 10$^{-3}$. The estimated CI/CO abundance ratio is about 0.3
for the best-fit model. However, a number of arguments point in the direction
of a clumpy medium, and a viable interpretation of the data within such a
context is provided.

distribution with morphological type and with stellar mass. We then calculate

them by the median SFR and SSFR values of individual control populations of

in interacting galaxies, and more so as the degree of interaction is higher.
The increase is, however, moderate, reaching a maximum of a factor of 1.9 for
the highest degree of interaction (mergers). The SFR and SSFR are enhanced
statistically in the population, but in many individual interacting galaxies
they are not enhanced at all. We discuss how those galaxies with the largest
SFR and/or SSFR enhancement can be defined as starbursts. This study is based

NUV-i colour, and for the different substructures within the cluster. These
luminosity functions are robust vs. statistical corrections since based on a
sample of 833 galaxies mainly identified as cluster members with spectroscopic
redshift (808) or high-quality optical scaling relations (10). We fit these
luminosity functions with a Schechter function, and compare the fitted
parameters with those determined for other nearby clusters and for the field.
The faint end slope of the Virgo NUV luminosity function (alpha = -1.19), here
sampled down to ~ NUV = -11.5 mag, is significantly flatter than the one
measured in other nearby clusters and similar to the field one. Similarly M* =
-17.56 is one-to-two magnitudes fainter than measured in Coma, A1367, the
Shapley supercluster, and the field. These differences seem due to the quite
uncertain statistical corrections and the small range in absolute magnitude
sampled in these clusters. We do not observe strong systematic differences in
the overall NUV luminosity function of the core of the cluster with respect to
that of its periphery. We notice, however, that the relative contribution of
red-to-blue galaxies at the faint end is inverted, with red quiescent objects
dominating the core of the cluster and star forming galaxies dominating beyond

new spacetime carrying the imprints of the incoming waves. Same behaviour is
valid also for any massless lightlike field. As a result of the violent
collision process either a naked singularity or a Cauchy horizon (CH) develops.
It was shown by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) that a particular class of
colliding gravitational waves (CGW) spacetime is locally isometric to the Kerr
metric for rotating black holes. This relation came to be known as the CX
duality. Such a duality can be exploited as an alternative derivation for the
Kerr metric as we do herein. Not each case gives rise to a CH but those which
do are transient to a black hole state provided stability requirements are met.
These classical considerations can be borrowed to shed light on black hole
formation in high energy collisions. Their questionable stability and many

gravity. Yet, to add an element of novelty, a quantum probe is sent in the
plane $\theta =\pi /2$ to the naked ring singularity of Kerr which develops for
the overspinning case $(a>M)$ to test it from a quantum picture. We show that

self-adjoint extension. As a result, the classical Kerr`s ring singularity is
healed and becomes quantum regular. Our poetic message of the paper is

""Orientation Vectors"" to train a feed forward neural network and suitable for
problems where large dimensions are involved and the clusters are
characteristically sparse. The new method is not NP hard as the problem size
increases. We `derive' the method by starting from Kolmogrov's method and then
relax some of the stringent conditions. We show for most classification
problems three layers are sufficient and the network size depends on the number
of clusters. We prove as the number of clusters increase from N to N+dN the
number of processing elements in the first layer only increases by d(logN), and
are proportional to the number of classes, and the method is not NP hard.
  Many examples are solved to demonstrate that the method of Orientation
Vectors requires much less computational effort than Radial Basis Function
methods and other techniques wherein distance computations are required, in
fact the present method increases logarithmically with problem size compared to
the Radial Basis Function method and the other methods which depend on distance
computations e.g statistical methods where probabilistic distances are
calculated. A practical method of applying the concept of Occum's razor to
choose between two architectures which solve the same classification problem
has been described. The ramifications of the above findings on the field of
Deep Learning have also been briefly investigated and we have found that it
directly leads to the existence of certain types of NN architectures which can
be used as a ""mapping engine"", which has the property of ""invertibility"", thus
improving the prospect of their deployment for solving problems involving Deep
Learning and hierarchical classification. The latter possibility has a lot of
future scope in the areas of machine learning and cloud computing.

the utility factor of agents strictly increases and non-local jumps of the
agents are allowed. In the present study, the utility factor u is defined in a
way such that it can take continuous values and depends on the tolerance
threshold as well as the fraction of unlike neighbours. Two models are
proposed: in model A the jump probability is determined by the sign of u only
which makes it equivalent to the discrete model. In model B the actual values
of u are considered. Model A and model B are shown to differ drastically as far
as segregation behaviour and phase transitions are concerned. In model A,
although segregation can be achieved, the cluster sizes are rather small. Also,
a frozen state is obtained in which steady states comprise of many unsatisfied
agents. In model B, segregated states with much larger cluster sizes are
obtained. The correlation function is calculated to show quantitatively that
larger clusters occur in model B. Moreover for model B, no frozen states exist
even for very low dilution and small tolerance parameter. This is in contrast
to the unconstrained discrete model considered earlier where agents can move
even when utility remains same. In addition, we also consider a few other
dynamical aspects which have not been studied in segregation models earlier.

absent themselves but the subwords of which are all present in the sequence.
The characteristic distribution of genomic MAWs as a function of their length
has been observed to be qualitatively similar for all living organisms, the
bulk being rather short, and only relatively few being long. It has been an
open issue whether the reason behind this phenomenon is statistical or reflects
a biological mechanism, and what biological information is contained in absent
words. In this work we demonstrate that the bulk can be described by a
probabilistic model of sampling words from random sequences, while the tail of
long MAWs is of biological origin. We introduce the novel concept of a core of
a minimal absent word, which are sequences present in the genome and closest to
a given MAW. We show that in bacteria and yeast the cores of the longest MAWs,
which exist in two or more copies, are located in highly conserved regions the
most prominent example being ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). We also show that while
the distribution of the cores of long MAWs is roughly uniform over these
genomes on a coarse-grained level, on a more detailed level it is strongly
enhanced in 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and, to a lesser extent, also in 5'
UTRs. This indicates that MAWs and associated MAW cores correspond to
fine-tuned evolutionary relationships, and suggest that they can be more widely
used as markers for genomic complexity.

particular we consider models formulated on the lattice which can be exactly
dualized to theories of conserved charge fluxes on lattice links. Apart from
eliminating the complex action problem at nonzero chemical potential mu, these
dualizations allow for a particle world line interpretation of the dual fluxes
from which one can extract data about the 2-particle wave function. As an
example we perform dual Monte Carlo simulations of the 2-dimensional O(3) model
at nonzero mu and finite volume, whose non-perturbative spectrum consists of a
massive triplet of particles. At nonzero mu particles are induced in the
system, which at sufficiently low temperature give rise to sectors of fixed
particle number. We show that the scattering phase shifts can be obtained
either from the critical chemical potential values separating the sectors or
directly from the wave function in the 2-particle sector. We find that both
methods give excellent agreement with the exact result. We discuss the

increase of the disc scale height and local accretion rate. This can explain
the <9 years rise time of the flare. If this mechanism is correct then the
flare may repeat on a timescale of several decades as the inner disc is emptied

time-varying objective functions. We propose algorithms with a discrete
time-sampling scheme to find and track the solution trajectory based on
prediction and correction steps, while sampling the problem data at a constant
rate of $1/h$, where $h$ is the length of the sampling interval. The prediction
step is derived by analyzing the iso-residual dynamics of the optimality
conditions. The correction step adjusts for the distance between the current
prediction and the optimizer at each time step, and consists either of one or
multiple gradient steps or Newton steps, which respectively correspond to the
gradient trajectory tracking (GTT) or Newton trajectory tracking (NTT)
algorithms. Under suitable conditions, we establish that the asymptotic error
incurred by both proposed methods behaves as $O(h^2)$, and in some cases as
$O(h^4)$, which outperforms the state-of-the-art error bound of $O(h)$ for
correction-only methods in the gradient-correction step. Moreover, when the
characteristics of the objective function variation are not available, we
propose approximate gradient and Newton tracking algorithms (AGT and ANT,
respectively) that still attain these asymptotical error bounds. Numerical
simulations demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed methods and that
they improve upon existing techniques by several orders of magnitude.

mechanism to increase their return on investment. The instances sold in this
way are called spot instances. In spite that spot instances are usually 90%
cheaper than on-demand instances, they can be terminated by provider when their
bidding prices are lower than market prices. Thus, they are largely used to
provision fault-tolerant applications only. In this paper, we explore how to
utilize spot instances to provision web applications, which are usually
considered availability-critical. The idea is to take advantage of differences
in price among various types of spot instances to reach both high availability
and significant cost saving. We first propose a fault-tolerant model for web
applications provisioned by spot instances. Based on that, we devise novel
auto-scaling polices for hourly billed cloud markets. We implemented the
proposed model and policies both on a simulation testbed for repeatable
validation and Amazon EC2. The experiments on the simulation testbed and the
real platform against the benchmarks show that the proposed approach can
greatly reduce resource cost and still achieve satisfactory Quality of Service
(QoS) in terms of response time and availability.

  dimension three","30 pages + 15 pages appendix with enumeration code",,,,"math.CO math.AG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lattice-free sets (convex subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ without interior integer
points) and their applications for cutting-plane methods in mixed-integer
optimization have been studied in recent literature. Notably, the family of all
integral lattice-free polyhedra which are not properly contained in another
integral lattice-free polyhedron has been of particular interest. We call these
polyhedra $\mathbb{Z}^d$-maximal.
  It is known that, for fixed $d$, the family $\mathbb{Z}^d$-maximal integral
lattice-free polyhedra is finite up to unimodular equivalence. In view of
possible applications in cutting-plane theory, one would like to have a
classification of this family. However, this turns out to be a challenging task
already for small dimensions.
  In contrast, the subfamily of all integral lattice-free polyhedra which are
not properly contained in any other lattice-free set, which we call
$\mathbb{R}^d$-maximal lattice-free polyhedra, allow a rather simple geometric
characterization. Hence, the question was raised for which dimensions the
notions of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-maximality and $\mathbb{R}^d$-maximality are
equivalent. This was known to be the case for dimensions one and two. On the
other hand, Nill and Ziegler (2011) showed that for dimension $d \ge 4$, there
exist polyhedra which are $\mathbb{Z}^d$-maximal but not
$\mathbb{R}^d$-maximal. In this article, we consider the remaining case $d = 3$
and prove that for integral polyhedra the notions of $\mathbb{R}^3$-maximality
and $\mathbb{Z}^3$-maximality are equivalent. As a consequence, the
classification of all $\mathbb{R}^3$-maximal integral polyhedra by Averkov,
Wagner and Weismantel (2011) contains all $\mathbb{Z}^3$-maximal integral
polyhedra.

magnetotransport features stemming from ballistic transport. Due to the short

table has columns for the patient group, for each of the interventions being
compared, for the criterion for the comparison (e.g. proportion who survived
after 5 years from treatment), and for each of the results. Currently, it is a
labour-intensive activity to read each published paper and extract the

studies investigating how some of the features from papers can be extracted, or
at least the relevant sentences identified. However, there is a lack of an NLP

constraints on what is an acceptable classification of the features to be

using global constraints (such as the features describing the patient group,

does not vanish at some point, then the isotropic realizability holds in the
neighborhood of that point. The global realizability in R^2 or in the torus is
much more delicate, since it involves the global existence of a regular
solution to a semilinear wave equation the coefficients of which depend on the
derivatives of U. Using the semilinear wave equation we prove a small
perturbation result: If DU is periodic and close enough to its average for the
C^4-norm, then the strain field is isotropically realizable in a given disk
centered at the origin. On the other hand, a counter-example shows that the
global realizability in R^2 may hold without the realizability in the torus,

Morris sensitivity analysis method was used to sample the parameter space and
reduce computational requirements, while maintaining a realistic representation

range-separated density functional theory and many-body perturbation
calculations within the GW approximation reveal that in trans-polyacetylene and
polythiophene the hole density localizes on a length scale of several
nanometers. This is due to exchange-induced translational symmetry breaking of
the charge density. Ionization potentials, optical absorption peaks, excitonic
binding energies and the optimally-tuned range parameter itself all become
independent of polymer length as it exceeds the critical localization scale.
Moreover, lattice disorder and the formation of a polaron result from the
charge localization in contrast to the traditional view that lattice
distortions precede charge localization. Our results can explain experimental
findings that polarons in conjugated polymers form instantaneously after
exposure to ultrafast light pulses.

regression models in which each parameter of a potentially complex response
distribution and not only the mean is related to a structured additive
predictor. The latter is composed additively of a variety of different
functional effect types such as nonlinear effects, spatial effects, random
coefficients, interaction surfaces or other (possibly nonstandard) basis
function representations. To enforce specific properties of the functional
effects such as smoothness, informative multivariate Gaussian priors are
assigned to the basis function coefficients. Inference can then be based on
computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques where
a generic procedure makes use of distribution-specific iteratively weighted
least squares approximations to the full conditionals. The framework of
distributional regression encompasses many special cases relevant for treating
nonstandard response structures such as highly skewed nonnegative responses,
overdispersed and zero-inflated counts or shares including the possibility for
zero- and one-inflation. We discuss distributional regression along a study on
determinants of labour incomes for full-time working males in Germany with a
particular focus on regional differences after the German reunification.
Controlling for age, education, work experience and local disparities, we
estimate full conditional income distributions allowing us to study various
distributional quantities such as moments, quantiles or inequality measures in
a consistent manner in one joint model. Detailed guidance on practical aspects
of model choice including the selection of several competing distributions for
labour incomes and the consideration of different covariate effects on the
income distribution complete the distributional regression analysis. We find
that next to a lower expected income, full-time working men in East Germany
also face a more unequal income distribution than men in the West, ceteris
paribus.

described in terms of a collection of particles confined in a box and
undergoing three key random mechanisms: diffusion, reproduction due to
fissions, and death due to absorption events. When the reactor is operated at
the critical point, and fissions are exactly compensated by absorptions, the
whole neutron population might in principle go to extinction because of the
wild fluctuations induced by births and deaths. This phenomenon, which has been
named critical catastrophe, is nonetheless never observed in practice: feedback
mechanisms acting on the total population, such as human intervention, have a
stabilizing effect. In this work, we revisit the critical catastrophe by
investigating the spatial behaviour of the fluctuations in a confined geometry.
When the system is free to evolve, the neutrons may display a wild patchiness
(clustering). On the contrary, imposing a population control on the total
population acts also against the local fluctuations, and may thus inhibit the
spatial clustering. The effectiveness of population control in quenching
spatial fluctuations will be shown to depend on the competition between the
mixing time of the neutrons (i.e., the average time taken for a particle to
explore the finite viable space) and the extinction time.

are developed and analyzed numerically. Depending on the amplitude of an
applied oscillatory magnetic field the particles orient their time averaged
anisotropy axis perpendicular to the applied field for low magnetic field
amplitudes and nearly parallel to the direction of the field for high
amplitudes. The transition between these regions takes place in a narrow field
interval. In the low field region the magnetic moment is locked to some crystal
axis and the energy absorption in an oscillatory driving field is dominated by
viscous losses associated with particle rotation in the liquid. In the opposite
limit the magnetic moment rotates within the particle while its easy axis being
nearly parallel to the external field direction oscillates. The kinetic
equations are generalized to include thermal fluctuations. This leads to a
significant increase of the power absorption in the low and intermediate field
region with a pronounced absorption peak as function of particle size. In the
high field region, on the other hand, the inclusion of thermal fluctuations
reduces the power absorption. The illustrative numerical calculations presented

5 R_eff). We use the kinematics of these disks to estimate the circular
velocity at large radii for these galaxies. We find that the Tully-Fisher
relation for our early-type galaxies is offset by about 0.5-0.7 magnitudes from
the relation for spiral galaxies. The residuals with respect to the spiral
Tully-Fisher relation correlate with estimates of the stellar mass-to-light
ratio, suggesting that the offset between the relations is mainly driven by
differences in stellar populations. We also observe a small offset between our
Tully-Fisher relation with the relation derived for the ATLAS3D sample based on
CO data representing the galaxies' inner regions (< 1 R_eff). This indicates
that the circular velocities at large radii are systematically 10% lower than
those near 0.5-1 R_eff, in line with recent determinations of the shape of the
mass profile of early-type galaxies. The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation of our
sample is distinctly tighter than the standard one, in particular when using
mass-to-light ratios based on dynamical models of the stellar kinematics. We
find that the early-type galaxies fall on the spiral baryonic Tully-Fisher
relation if one assumes M/L_K = 0.54 M_sun/L_sun for the stellar populations of
the spirals, a value similar to that found by recent studies of the dynamics of
spiral galaxies. Such a mass-to-light ratio for spiral galaxies would imply
that their disks are 60-70% of maximal. Our analysis increases the range of
galaxy morphologies for which the baryonic Tully-Fisher relations holds,
strengthening previous claims that it is a more fundamental scaling relation
than the classical Tully-Fisher relation.

(TESs) read out with rf-SQUIDs, for microwave multiplexing purposes. A
promising alternative solution is based on superconducting microwave
resonators, that have undergone rapid development in the last decade. These
detectors, called Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), are
inherently multiplexed in the frequency domain and suitable for even
larger-scale pixel arrays, with theoretical high energy resolution and fast
response. The aim of our activity is to develop arrays of microresonator
detectors for X-ray spectroscopy and suitable for the calorimetric measurement
of the energy spectra of 163Ho. Superconductive multilayer films composed by a
sequence of pure Titanium and stoichiometric TiN layers show many ideal
properties for MKIDs, such as low loss, large sheet resistance, large kinetic
inductance, and tunable critical temperature $T_c$. We developed Ti/TiN
multilayer microresonators with $T_c$ within the range from 70 mK to 4.5 K and
with good uniformity. In this contribution we present the design solutions
adopted, the fabrication processes and the characterization results.

extremely challenging, in particular when low complexity is needed. Given an

block-wise fused in the Fourier domain with weights depending on the Fourier
spectrum magnitude. The method is motivated from the physiological fact that
camera shake blur has a random nature and therefore, nearby video frames are
generally blurred differently. Experiments with numerous videos recorded in the

achieves state-of-the-art results while at the same time being much faster than

mechanics based on a non-relativistic, Lagrangian 3+1 formalism of a closed
Universe $M$, existing on timeless configuration space $\mathcal{M}$. However,
not much was said there about the role of locality, which was not assumed. This
paper is an attempt to fill that gap. To deal with the challenges gauge
symmetries may pose to a good definition of locality, I start by demanding
symmetries to have an action on $\mathcal{M}$ so that the quotient wrt the
symmetries respects certain factorizations of $\mathcal{M}$. These
factorizations are algebraic splits of $\mathcal{M}$ into sub-spaces
$\mathcal{M}=\bigoplus_i \mathcal{M}_{O_i}$-- each factor corresponding to a
physical sub-region $O_i$. This deals with kinematic locality, but locality in
full can only emerge dynamically, and is not postulated. I describe conditions
under which it can be said to have emerged. The dynamics of $O$ is independent
of its complement, $M-O$, if the projection of extremal curves on $M$ onto the
space of extremal curves intrinsic to $O$ is a surjective map. This roughly
corresponds to $e^{i\hat{H}t}\circ \mathsf{pr}_{\mbox{O}}= \mathsf{pr}_{\mbox{
O}}\circ e^{i\hat{H}t}$, where $\mathsf{pr}_{\mbox{ O}}:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow
\mathcal{M}_O^{\partial O}$ is a linear projection. This criterion for locality
can be made approximate -- an impossible feat had it been already postulated --
and it can be applied for theories which do not have hyperbolic equations of
motion, and/or no fixed causal structure. When two regions are \emph{mutually
independent} according to the criterion proposed here, the semi-classical path
integral kernel factorizes, showing cluster decomposition which is what one
would like to obtain from any definition of locality.

studied, there is not much known about the generation and plasma properties of
the wave. In this paper we discuss the effect of an EUV wave on the local
plasma as it passes through the corona. We studied the EUV wave, generated
during the 2011 February 15 X-class flare/CME event, using Differential
Emission Measure diagnostics. We analyzed regions on the path of the EUV wave
and investigated the local density and temperature changes. From our study we
have quantitatively confirmed previous results that during wave passage the
plasma visible in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171A channel is
getting heated to higher temperatures corresponding to AIA 193A and 211A
channels. We have calculated an increase of 6 - 9% in density and 5 - 6% in
temperature during the passage of the EUV wave. We have compared the variation
in temperature with the adiabatic relationship and have quantitatively
demonstrated the phenomenon of heating due to adiabatic compression at the wave
front. However, the cooling phase does not follow adiabatic relaxation but
shows slow decay indicating slow energy release being triggered by the wave
passage. We have also identified that heating is taking place at the front of
the wave pulse rather than at the rear. Our results provide support for the
case that the event under study here is a compressive fast-mode wave or a
shock.

about their source radiation mechanisms, and about the geometry of the
scattered light regions. Optical observations, of both the linear and circular
polarisation components, have been impeded due to non-optimised
instrumentation. The need for suitable observing conditions and the
availability of luminous targets are also limiting factors. GASP uses division
of amplitude polarimeter (DOAP) (Compain and Drevillon) to measure the four
components of the Stokes vector simultaneously, which eliminates the
constraints placed upon the need for moving parts during observation, and
offers a real-time complete measurement of polarisation. Results from the GASP
calibration are presented in this work for both a 1D detector system, and a
pixel-by-pixel analysis on a 2D detector system. Following Compain et al. we
use the Eigenvalue Calibration Method (ECM) to measure the polarimetric
limitations of the instrument for each of the two systems. Consequently, the
ECM is able to compensate for systematic errors introduced by the calibration
optics, and it also accounts for all optical elements of the polarimeter in the
output. Initial laboratory results of the ECM are presented, using APD
detectors, where errors of 0.2% and 0.1{\deg} were measured for the degree of
linear polarisation and polarisation angle respectively. Channel-to-channel
image registration is an important aspect of 2-D polarimetry. We present our
calibration results of the measured Mueller matrix of each sample, used by the
ECM. A set of Zenith flat-field images were recorded during an observing
campaign at the Palomar 200 inch telescope in November 2012. From these we show
the polarimetric errors from the spatial polarimetry indicating both the
stability and absolute accuracy of GASP.

the main goals of modern astrophysics. We study the velocity dispersion
behaviour of Galactic disc stars as a function of the [Mg/Fe] ratio, which can
be used as a proxy of relative age. This key relation is essential to constrain
the formation mechanisms of the disc stellar populations as well as the cooling
processes. We used the recommended parameters and chemical abundances of 7800
FGK Milky Way field stars from the second internal data release of the Gaia-ESO
Survey. These stars were observed with the GIRAFFE spectrograph, and cover a
large spatial volume (6<R<10kpc and |Z|<2kpc). Based on the [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H]
ratios, we separated the thin- from the thick-disc sequence. From analysing the
Galactocentric velocity of the stars for the thin disc, we find a weak positive
correlation between Vphi and [Fe/H], due to a slowly rotating Fe-poor tail. For
the thick disc, a strong correlation with [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] is established. We
have detected an inversion of the radial velocity dispersion with [Mg/Fe] for
thick-disc stars with [Fe/H]<-0.1dex and [Mg/Fe]>+0.2dex. First, the velocity
dispersion increases with [Mg/Fe] at all [Fe/H] ratios for the thin-disc stars,
and then it decreases for the thick-disc at the highest [Mg/Fe] abundances.
Similar trends are observed within the errors for the azimuthal velocity
dispersion, while a continuous increase with [Mg/Fe] is observed for the
vertical velocity dispersion. The velocity dispersion decrease agrees with
previous measurements of the RAVE survey, although it is observed here for a
greater metallicity interval and a larger spatial volume. We confirm the
existence of [Mg/Fe]-rich thick-disc stars with cool kinematics in the
generally turbulent context of the primitive Galactic disc. This is discussed
in the framework of the different disc formation scenarios.

respect to a cloud-free atmosphere model spectrum. A potential cause of such

a mechanical deformation of the waveguide. It is shown that any optical
modulation vanishes independently of the applied strain when the applied

modulation is also largely independent of the applied strain. This demonstrates
that plasma carrier dispersion is responsible for the observed electro-optic

of investigating the structure arising from the relationship between relevant
entities such as characters, locations and organizations. In this study, we
represent entities appearing in the same context as a co-occurrence network,
where links are established according to a null model based on random, shuffled

model displays interesting topological features, such as the small world
feature, characterized by high values of clustering coefficient. The
effectiveness of our model was verified in a practical pattern recognition task
in real networks. When compared with traditional word adjacency networks, our
model displayed optimized results in identifying unknown references in texts.
Because the proposed representation plays a complementary role in
characterizing unstructured documents via topological analysis of named

written texts (and related systems), specially if combined with traditional

  1.4 is updated into a new full version",,,,"math.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  From the view of Heegaard splitting, it is known that if a closed orientable
3-manifold admits a distance at least three Heegaard splitting, then it is
hyperbolic. However, for a closed orientable 3-manifold admitting only distance
at most two Heegaard splittings, there are examples shows that it could be
reducible, Seifert, toroidal or hyperbolic. According to Thurston's
Geometrization conjecture, the most important piece of eight geometries is
hyperbolic. Thus to read out a hyperbolic 3-manifold from a distance two
Heegaard splittings is critical in studying Heegaard splittings.
  Inspired by the construction of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with a distance two
Heegaard splitting [Qiu, Zou and Guo, Pacific J. Math. 275 (2015), no. 1,
231-255], we introduce the definition of a locally large geodesic in curve
complex and furthermore the locally large distance two Heegaard splitting. Then
we prove that if a 3-manifold admits a locally large distance two Heegaard
splitting, then it is a hyperbolic manifold or an amalgamation of a hyperbolic
manifold and a seifert manifold along an incompressible torus, i.e., almost
hyperbolic, while the example in Section 3 shows that there is a non hyperbolic
3-manifold in this case. After examining those non hyperbolic cases, we give a
sufficient and necessary condition for a hyperbolic 3-manifold when it admits a
locally large distance two Heegaard splitting.

line profile distortions over the rotation period of each star which we
interpret as starspots. The transient distortions are modelled with
spot/photosphere contrast ratios that correspond to model atmosphere
temperature differences of Tphot-Tspot = 200 and 300 K. GJ 791.2A is a fully
convective star with vsini = 35.1 km/s. Although we find more starspot
structure at high latitudes, we reconstruct spots at a range of phases and
latitudes with a mean spot filling of ~3%. LP 944-20 is one of the brightest
known late-M dwarfs, with spectral type M9V and vsini = 30.8 km/s. Its spectral
time series exhibits two dominant transient line distortions that are
reconstructed as high latitude spots, while a mean spot filling factor of only
1.5% is found. The occurrence of low-contrast spots at predominantly high
latitudes, which we see in both targets here, is in general likely to be
responsible for the low amplitude photometric variability seen in late-M

yield an rms velocity variability of 138 m/s, which can be reduced by a factor
of 1.9 using our reconstructed surface brightness distributions.

out of these filaments and fall, together with residual gas, towards the centre
of the layer, to form a single large-$N$ cluster, which then evolves by
competitive accretion, producing one or two very massive protostars and a
diaspora of ejected (mainly low-mass) protostars; the pattern of filaments is
reminiscent of the hub and spokes systems identified recently by observers. At
high $\Delta v_{_{\rm{o}}}$, star formation occurs sooner and the
shock-compressed layer breaks up into a network of filaments; the pattern of
filaments here is more like a spider's web, with several small-$N$ clusters
forming independently of one another, in cores at the intersections of

are fewer ejections of protostars. As the relative velocity is increased, the

context of loop quantum gravity, quantum states of geometry are defined as spin
networks. These are graphs decorated with spin and intertwiners, which
represent quantized excitations of areas and volumes of the space geometry.
Here, we develop the condensed matter point of view on extracting the physical
and geometrical information out of spin network states: we introduce new Ising
spin network states, both in 2d on a square lattice and in 3d on a hexagonal
lattice, whose correlations map onto the usual Ising model in statistical
physics. We construct these states from the basic holonomy operators of loop
gravity and derive a set of local Hamiltonian constraints which entirely
characterize our states. We discuss their phase diagram and show how the
distance can be reconstructed from the correlations in the various phases.
Finally, we propose generalizations of these Ising states, which open the
perspective to study the coarse graining and dynamics of spin network states

this giant molecular cloud, in bands centered at 250, 350, and 500 {\mu}m. In
this initial paper, we show our 500 {\mu}m data smoothed to a resolution of 2.5
arcminutes (approximately 0.5 pc). We show that the mean level of the
fractional polarization p and most of its spatial variations can be accounted
for using an empirical three-parameter power-law fit, p = p_0 N^(-0.4)
S^(-0.6), where N is the hydrogen column density and S is the
polarization-angle dispersion on 0.5 pc scales. The decrease of p with
increasing S is expected because changes in the magnetic field direction within
the cloud volume sampled by each measurement will lead to cancellation of
polarization signals. The decrease of p with increasing N might be caused by
the same effect, if magnetic field disorder increases for high column density
sightlines. Alternatively, the intrinsic polarization efficiency of the dust
grain population might be lower for material along higher density sightlines.
We find no significant correlation between N and S. Comparison of observed
submillimeter polarization maps with synthetic polarization maps derived from
numerical simulations provides a promising method for testing star formation
theories. Realistic simulations should allow for the possibility of variable
intrinsic polarization efficiency. The measured levels of correlation among p,
N, and S provide points of comparison between observations and simulations.

Given
observed data that is believed to be a realization of some parameterized model,
the aim is to find parameter values that are able to explain the observed data.
In many situations, the dominant sources of uncertainty must be included into
the model, for making reliable predictions. This naturally leads to stochastic
models. Stochastic models render parameter inference much harder, as the aim
then is to find a distribution of likely parameter values. In Bayesian
statistics, which is a consistent framework for data-driven learning, this
so-called posterior distribution can be used to make probabilistic predictions.
We propose a novel, exact and very efficient approach for generating posterior
parameter distributions, for stochastic differential equation models calibrated
to measured time-series. The algorithm is inspired by re-interpreting the
posterior distribution as a statistical mechanics partition function of an
object akin to a polymer, where the measurements are mapped on heavier beads
compared to those of the simulated data. To arrive at distribution samples, we
employ a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approach combined with a multiple time-scale
integration. A separation of time scales naturally arises if either the number
of measurement points or the number of simulation points becomes large.
Furthermore, at least for 1D problems, we can decouple the harmonic modes
between measurement points and solve the fastest part of their dynamics
analytically. Our approach is applicable to a wide range of inference problems
and is highly parallelizable.

reformation using in situ magnetic field observations from the Cassini

shocks across two orders of magnitude in Alfven Mach number (MA) which could
potentially bridge the gap between modest terrestrial shocks and more exotic
astrophysical shocks. For the first time, we show evidence for cyclic
reformation controlled by specular ion reflection occurring at the predicted

3D anisotropic diffusion problems. The M-uniform mesh approach is used, where
an anisotropic adaptive mesh is generated as a uniform one in the metric
specified by a tensor. In addition to mesh adaptation, preservation of the
maximum principle is also studied. Some new sufficient conditions for maximum
principle preservation are developed, and a mesh quality measure is defined to
server as a good indicator. Four different metric tensors are investigated: one
is the identity matrix, one focuses on minimizing an error bound, another one
on preservation of the maximum principle, while the fourth combines both.
Numerical examples show that these metric tensors serve their purposes.
Particularly, the fourth leads to meshes that improve the satisfaction of the
maximum principle by the finite element solution while concentrating elements
in regions where the error is large. Application of the anisotropic mesh
adaptation to fractured reservoir simulation in petroleum engineering is also
investigated, where unphysical solutions can occur and mesh adaptation can help
improving the satisfaction of the maximum principle.

metalization. This might lead to a reduction in conductivity. A systematic
study on the impact of conductivity is presented. The efficiency, gain and
bandwidth of cylindrical wire meander line, dipole, and Yagi-Uda antennas were
compared for materials with conductivities in the range $\mathrm{10^3}$ to
$\mathrm{10^9}$ S/m. In this range, the absorption efficiency of both the
dipole and meander line changed little, however the conductivity significantly
impacts on radiation efficiency and the absorption cross section of the
antennas. The extinction cross section of the dipole and meander line antennas
(antennas that Thevenin equivalent circuit is applicable) also vary with
radiation efficiency. From the point of radiation efficiency, the dipole
antenna performance is most robust under decreasing conductivity. Antennas
studied in this study were fabricated with brass and graphite. Radiation
efficiency of the antennas were measured by improved Wheeler cap (IWC) method.
Measurement results showed a reasonable agreement with simulations. We also
measured the extinction cross section of the six fabricated prototypes.

of nonlinear electrodynamics as source. Calculating heat capacity, we study the
stability and phase transitions of these black holes. We show that Maxwell,
logarithmic and exponential theories yield only type one phase transition which
is related to the root(s) of heat capacity. Whereas for correction form of
nonlinear electrodynamics, heat capacity contains two roots and one divergence
point. Next, we use geometrical approach for studying classical thermodynamical
behavior of the system. We show that Weinhold and Ruppeiner metrics fail to
provide fruitful results and the consequences of the Quevedo approach are not
completely matched to the heat capacity results. Then, we employ a new metric
for solving this problem. We show that this approach is successful and all
divergencies of its Ricci scalar and phase transition points coincide. We also
show that there is no phase transition for uncharged BTZ black holes.

are characterized by the field functions of coordinates of several particles,
namely multi-particle fields. By applying the quantization procedure to these
multi-particle fields, hadronic creation and annihilation operators have been
obtained. Due to internal degrees of freedom of such hadron field, it can
interact with gauge fields. This interaction is introduced by a standard
derivative extension. The gauge field which was obtained in this way revealed
to be a multi-particle field. We construct the dynamic equations for this
multi-particle gauge field. It was shown that the solutions of these equations
can describe the interaction of quarks inside hadrons and also the interaction
of quarks in different hadrons via two-particle gluon field. Quanta of this
two-gluon field can be considered as bound states of two gluons. These
solutions describe confinement of quarks and gluons.

obtained from cytochrome C7 found in Geobacter sulfurreducens, PPCA protein can
interact with Deoxycholate (DXCA), while its other homologs do not, as observed
from the crystal structures. Utilizing the concept of 'structure-function
relationship', an effort has been initiated towards understanding the driving
force for recognition of DXCA exclusively by PPCA among its homologs. Further,
a combinatorial analysis of the binding sequences (contiguous sequence of amino
acid residues of binding locations) is performed to build graph-theoretic
models, which show that PPCA differs from its homologues. Analysis of the
results suggests that the underlying impetus of recognition of DXCA by PPCA is
embedded in its primary sequence and 3D conformation.
