gamma rays by Fermi-LAT with a hard spectrum. It was first detected at
very-high-energy by VERITAS and latter confirmed by MAGIC. Attempts to find
limits on its redshift include three estimations by modeling gamma-ray
observations, and one obtained by analyzing Lyb and Lyg absorption lines
observed in the far-UV spectra (from HST/COS) caused by absorbing gas along the
line of sight. They allowed to constrain the redshift range to 0:6<z<1:19,
which places PKS 1424+240 in the very interesting condition to be one of the
few candidates to be the most distant blazars detected at very-high-energy
gamma rays. Redshift determination of BL-Lac objects are difficult to achieve.
We have found that redshift of blazars can be determined by its association to
a galaxy group or cluster. To explore this possibility for PKS 1424+240, we
have carried out spectroscopic measurements with the Gemini North telescope of
galaxies in its field of view. In this work we present the optical spectrum of
PKS 1424+240 and show preliminary results of the blazar environment
characterization. Spectroscopic redshift using the optical spectrum of PKS
1424+240 could not be determined in this work.

represented. Conventional appearance-based trackers are using increasingly more
complex features in order to be robust. However, complex representations
typically not only require more computation for feature extraction, but also
make the state inference complicated. We show that with a careful feature
selection scheme, extremely simple yet discriminative features can be used for
robust object tracking. The central component of the proposed method is a
succinct and discriminative representation of the object using discriminative
non-orthogonal binary subspace (DNBS) which is spanned by Haar-like features.
The DNBS representation inherits the merits of the original NBS in that it
efficiently describes the object. It also incorporates the discriminative
information to distinguish foreground from background. However, the problem of
finding the DNBS bases from an over-complete dictionary is NP-hard. We propose
a greedy algorithm called discriminative optimized orthogonal matching pursuit
(D-OOMP) to solve this problem. An iterative formulation named iterative D-OOMP
is further developed to drastically reduce the redundant computation between
iterations and a hierarchical selection strategy is integrated for reducing the
search space of features. The proposed DNBS representation is applied to object
tracking through SSD-based template matching. We validate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on challenging videos with comparisons
against several state-of-the-art trackers and demonstrate its capability to
track objects in clutter and moving background.

single application-level connection to be split to more than one TCP stream,
and consequently more than one network interface, as opposed to the traditional
TCP/IP model. Being a transport layer protocol, MPTCP can easily interact
between the application using it and the network supporting it. However, MPTCP
does not have control of its own route. Default IP routing behavior generally
takes all traffic through the shortest or best-metric path. However, this
behavior may actually cause paths to collide with each other, creating
contention for bandwidth in a number of edges. This can result in a bottleneck
which limits the throughput of the network. Therefore, a multipath routing
mechanism is necessary to ensure smooth operation of MPTCP. We created smoc, a
Simple Multipath OpenFlow Controller, that uses only topology information of
the network to avoid collision where possible. Evaluation of smoc in a virtual
local-area and a physical wide-area SDNs showed favorable results as smoc
provided better performance than simple or spanning-tree routing mechanisms.

approach is a histogram free method particularly suited for systems with

it is commonly found in Lattice Gauge Theories and in some Statistical

suppression that allows us to estimate the density of states over several

method using Compact U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory. A thorough study of the

the analytically expected behaviour. We obtain high precision values for the
critical coupling for the phase transition and for the peak value of the
specific heat for lattice sizes ranging from $8^4$ to $20^4$. Our results
perfectly agree with the reference values reported in the literature, which
covers lattice sizes up to $18^4$. Robust results for the $20^4$ volume are

metastabilities developed at the pseudo-critical coupling, so far has been out

challenging, as it is an intermediate region between a granular material and a
fluid flow. Boyer \textit{et al.}\citep{Boyer2011} proposed a local rheology
unifying dense dry-granular and viscous-suspension flows, but it has been
validated only for neutrally-buoyant particles in a confined system. Here we
generalize the Boyer \textit{et al.}\citep{Boyer2011} model to account for the
weight of a particle by addition of a pressure $P_0$, and test the ability of
this model to describe sediment transport in an idealized laboratory river. We
subject a bed of settling plastic particles to a laminar-shear flow from above,
and use Refractive-Index-Matching to track particles' motion and determine
local rheology --- from the fluid-granular interface to deep in the granular
bed. Data from all experiments collapse onto a single curve of friction $\mu$
as a function of the viscous number $I_v$ over the range $10^{-5} \leq I_v \leq
1$, validating the local rheology model. For $I_v < 10^{-5}$, however, data do
not collapse. Instead of undergoing a jamming transition with $\mu \rightarrow
\mu_s$ as expected, particles transition to a creeping regime where we observe
a continuous decay of the friction coefficient $\mu \leq \mu_s$ as $I_v$
decreases. The rheology of this creep regime cannot be described by the local

history of heating of the primordial intergalactic medium (IGM) at z~30-10. It
has been suggested that X-rays from the first accreting black holes could
significantly heat the Universe at these early epochs. Here we propose another
IGM heating mechanism associated with the first stars. As known from previous
work, the remnants of powerful supernovae (SNe) ending the lives of massive
Population III stars could readily expand out of their host dark matter
minihalos into the surrounding IGM, aided by the preceeding photoevaporation of
the halo's gas by the UV radiation from the progenitor star. We argue that
during the evolution of such a remnant a significant fraction of the SN kinetic
energy can be put into low-energy (E<30 MeV) cosmic rays that will eventually
escape into the IGM. These subrelativistic cosmic rays could propagate through
the Universe and heat the IGM by ~10-100 K by z~15, before more powerful
reionization/heating mechanisms associated with the first galaxies and quasars
came into play. Future 21-cm observations could thus constrain the energetics
of the first supernovae and provide information on the magnetic fields in the

them; for example, identifying strategies to revert a diseased cell to a
healthy state, or a mature cell to a pluripotent state. Two recent
methodologies suggest that the controllability of complex systems can be
predicted solely from the graph of interactions between variables, without
considering their dynamics: structural controllability and minimum dominating
sets. We demonstrate that such structure-only methods fail to characterize
controllability when dynamics are introduced. We study Boolean network
ensembles of network motifs as well as three models of biochemical regulation:
the segment polarity network in Drosophila melanogaster, the cell cycle of
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the floral organ arrangement in
Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate that structure-only methods both
undershoot and overshoot the number and which sets of critical variables best
control the dynamics of these models, highlighting the importance of the actual
system dynamics in determining control. Our analysis further shows that the
logic of automata transition functions, namely how canalizing they are, plays
an important role in the extent to which structure predicts dynamics.

(SOL2014-03-29T17:48), in which we found an asymmetric eruption of a sigmoidal
filament and an ensuing circular flare ribbon. Initially both EUV images and a
preflare nonlinear force-free field model show that the filament is embedded in
magnetic fields with a fan-spine-like structure. In the first phase, which is
defined by a weak but still increasing X-ray emission, the western portion of
the sigmoidal filament arches upward and then remains quasi-static for about
five minutes. The western fan-like and the outer spine-like fields display an
ascending motion, and several associated ribbons begin to brighten. Also found
is a bright EUV flow that streams down along the eastern fan-like field. In the
second phase that includes the main peak of hard X-ray (HXR) emission, the
filament erupts, leaving behind two major HXR sources formed around its central
dip portion and a circular ribbon brightened sequentially. The expanding
western fan-like field interacts intensively with the outer spine-like field,
as clearly seen in running difference EUV images. We discuss these observations
in favor of a scenario where the asymmetric eruption of the sigmoidal filament
is initiated due to an MHD instability and further facilitated by reconnection
at a quasi-null in corona; the latter is in turn enhanced by the filament
eruption and subsequently produces the circular flare ribbon.

be particularly concerned in this study. [Conclusions:] The negative
correlation between complexity and effort is not a coincidence under particular

other factors, such as Programmer Capability and Analyst Capability, can
inevitably play a ""friction"" role in weakening the practical influences of

geography literature over the past several decades. However, it creates
enormous confusion and frustration, particularly in the context of geographic
information science, because of scale-related issues such as image resolution,
and the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). This paper argues that the
confusion and frustration mainly arise from Euclidean geometric thinking, with
which locations, directions, and sizes are considered absolute, and it is time
to reverse this conventional thinking. Hence, we review fractal geometry,
together with its underlying way of thinking, and compare it to Euclidean
geometry. Under the paradigm of Euclidean geometry, everything is measurable,
no matter how big or small. However, geographic features, due to their fractal
nature, are essentially unmeasurable or their sizes depend on scale. For
example, the length of a coastline, the area of a lake, and the slope of a
topographic surface are all scale-dependent. Seen from the perspective of
fractal geometry, many scale issues, such as the MAUP, are inevitable. They
appear unsolvable, but can be dealt with. To effectively deal with
scale-related issues, we introduce topological and scaling analyses based on
street-related concepts such as natural streets, street blocks, and natural
cities. We further contend that spatial heterogeneity, or the fractal nature of
geographic features, is the first and foremost effect of two spatial
properties, because it is general and universal across all scales.

and PRAGMA researchers have complete freedom to access network resources to
develop, experiment, and evaluate new ideas without the concerns of interfering

  In the first phase, PRAGMA-ENT focused on establishing an international L2

PacificWave, JGN-X, and TWAREN, PRAGMA-ENT backbone connects Open\-Flow-enabled
switches at University of Florida (UF), University of California San Diego

limitations leading to the development of a new approach, called AutoVFlow.
This paper will share our experience in the establishment of PRAGMA-ENT

(dS) space is presented. Technically, respecting the dS ambient space notation,
the field equation is given by the coordinate-independent Casimir operators of
the de Sitter group. Analogous to the quantization of the electromagnetic field
in Minkowski space, the field equation admits gauge solutions. The notation
allows us to exhibit the formalism of Gupta-Bleuler triplets for the present
field in exactly the same manner as it occurs for the electromagnetic field. In
this regard, centering on the spin-two part (the traceless part,
${\cal{K}}^t$), the field solution is written as a product of a generalized
polarization tensor and a minimally coupled massless scalar field. Then,
admitting a de Sitter-invariant vacuum through the so-called ""Krein space
quantization"", the de Sitter fully covariant two-point function is calculated.
This function is interestingly free of pathological large distance behavior
(infrared divergence). Moreover, the spin-zero part (the pure-trace part;
${\cal{K}}^{pt}$) of the field is discussed in this paper. It is shown that the
implications of the dS group unitary irreducible representations restrict the
gauge-fixing parameter to the optimal value, which remarkably results in the
pure-trace part be written in terms of a conformally coupled massless scalar
field.

periodic solutions in minimal flow units to spatially localized solutions on
extended domains. One set of spanwise-localized solutions of plane Couette flow
exhibits homoclinic snaking, a process by which steady-state solutions grow
additional structure smoothly at their fronts when continued parametrically.
Homoclinic snaking is well understood mathematically in the context of the
one-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation. Consequently, the snaking solutions
of plane Couette flow form a promising connection between the largely
phenomenological study of laminar-turbulent patterns in viscous shear flows and
the mathematically well-developed field of pattern-formation theory. In this
paper we present a numerical study of the snaking solutions, generalizing
beyond the fixed streamwise wavelength of previous studies. We find a number of
new solution features, including bending, skewing, and finite-size effects. We
show that the finite-size effects result from the shift-reflect symmetry of the
traveling wave and establish the parameter regions over which snaking occurs. A
new winding solution of plane Couette flow is derived from a strongly skewed
localized equilibrium.

introduced. The key tool is an efficient approximation of the Milstein term by
particularly tailored nested derivative-free terms. For the resulting

considerably reduced by some power. Further, a rigorous computational cost
model is considered and the so called effective order of convergence is
introduced which allows to directly compare various numerical schemes in terms

stochastic partial differential equations, including equations with operators
that do not need to be pointwise multiplicative, that the effective order of
convergence of the proposed derivative-free Milstein scheme is significantly
higher than for the original Milstein scheme. In this case, the derivative-free

strong enough carrier excitation, the nonequilibrium system evolves towards a
thermal steady state. Our analysis is based on two classes of observables.
First, the occupations of fermionic momenta, which are the eigenvalues of the
one-particle density matrix, match in the steady state the values in the
corresponding Gibbs ensemble. This indicates thermalization of static fermionic
correlations on the entire lattice. Second, the dynamic current-current
correlations, including the time-resolved optical conductivity, also take the
form of their thermal counterparts. Remarkably, both static and dynamic
fermionic correlations thermalize with identical temperatures. Our results
suggest that the subsequent relaxation processes, observed in time-resolved

with bulk Rashba spin-orbit interaction is solved using the numerical
renormalization group under two different experimental scenarios. For a fixed
Fermi energy, the Kondo temperature T_K varies weakly with Rashba coupling
\alpha, as reported previously. If instead the band filling is low and held
constant, increasing \alpha can drive the system into a helical regime with
exponential enhancement of T_K. Under either scenario, thermodynamic properties
at low temperatures T exhibit the same dependences on T/T_K as are found for
\alpha = 0. Unlike the conventional Kondo effect, however, the impurity
exhibits static spin correlations with conduction electrons of nonzero orbital
angular momentum about the impurity site. We also consider a magnetic field
that Zeeman splits the conduction band but not the impurity level, an effective
picture that arises under a proposed route to access the helical regime in a
driven system. The impurity contribution to the system's ground-state angular
momentum is found to be a universal function of the ratio of the Zeeman energy
to a temperature scale that is not T_K (as would be the case in a magnetic
field that couples directly to the impurity spin), but rather is proportional
to T_K divided by the impurity hybridization width. This universal scaling is
explained via a perturbative treatment of field-induced changes in the
electronic density of states.

applications in Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research, and High Energy

using the UCT formula to balance exploitation and exploration. It has been
suggested that the optimum in the exploitation- exploration balance differs for
different search tree sizes: small search trees needs more exploitation; large
search trees need more exploration. Small search trees occur in variations of
MCTS, such as parallel and ensemble approaches. This paper investigates the
possibility of improving the performance of Ensemble UCT by increasing the

improved performance. The results are important for improving the performance

gyration of the fast ions. In either case, spectra of Doppler-shifted line

data stream in real time. This article introduces an efficient sequential Monte
Carlo algorithm designed for learning unknown changepoints in continuous time.
The method is intuitively simple: new changepoints for the latest window of
data are proposed by conditioning only on data observed since the most recent
estimated changepoint, as these carry most of the information about the state
of the process prior to the update. The proposed method shows improved
performance over the current state of the art. Another advantage of the
proposed algorithm is that it can be made adaptive, varying the number of
particles according to the apparent local complexity of the target changepoint
probability distribution. This saves valuable computing time when changes in
the change- point distribution are negligible, and enables re-balancing of the
importance weights of ex- isting particles when a significant change in the
target distribution is encountered. The plain and adaptive versions of the
method are illustrated using the canonical con- tinuous time changepoint
problem of inferring the intensity of an inhomogeneous Poisson process.
Performance is demonstrated using both conjugate and non-conjugate Bayesian
models for the intensity.

quantum states, most results obtained so far pertain to bipartite systems whose
subsystems are of specific dimensions. In contrast very few results for
bipartite systems whose subsystems are of arbitrary dimensions, are known. This
is because a rich variety of (algebraic or geometric) structure is exhibited by
different sets of orthogonal states owing to which it is difficult to associate
some common property underlying them all, i.e., a common property that would
play a crucial role in the local distinguishability of these states. In this
paper, I propose a framework for the distinguishability by one-way LOCC
($1$-LOCC) of sets of orthogonal bipartite states in a $d_A \otimes d_B$
bipartite system, where $d_A, d_B$ are the dimensions of both subsytems,
labelled as $A$ and $B$. I show that if the $i$-th party (where $i=A,B$) can
initiate a $1$-LOCC protocol to perfectly distinguish among a set of orthogonal
bipartite states, then the information of the existence of such a $1$-LOCC
protocol lies in a subspace of $d_i \times d_i$ hermitian matrices, denoted by
$\Tb^{(i)}$, and that the method to extract this information (of the existence
of this $1$-LOCC protocol) from $\Tb^{(i)}$ depends on the value of $dim
\Tb^{(i)}$. In this way one can give sweeping results for the $1$-LOCC
(in)distinguishability of all sets of orthogonal bipartite states corresponding
to certain values of $dim \Tb^{(i)}$. Thus I propose that the value of $dim
\Tb^{(i)}$ gives the common underlying property based on which sweeping results
for the $1$-LOCC (in)distinguishability of orthogonal bipartite quantum states
can be made.

  results to torsion pairs and injective classes) is added",,,,"math.KT math.AG math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We ask whether a morphism $g$ in a triangulated category $C$ endowed with a
weight structure ""kills weights"" (between an integer $m$ and some $n\ge m$). If
$g=id_M$ (where $M\in Obj C$) and $C$ is Karoubian, then $g$ kills weights
$m,\dots,n$ whenever there exists a weight decomposition of $M$ that ""avoids""
these weights (in the sense earlier defined by Wildeshaus).
  We prove the equivalence of several definitions for killing weights. In
particular, we describe a family of cohomological functors that ""detects"" this
notion. We also prove that $M$ is without weights $m,\dots, n$ (i.e., a
decomposition of $M$ avoiding these weights exists) if and only if the
corresponding condition is fulfilled for its weight complex $t(M)$.
  These results allow us to get new (stronger) results on the conservativity of
the weight complex functor $t$. We study in detail the case $C=SH$ (endowed
with the spherical weight structure whose heart consists of coproducts of
sphere spectra); the corresponding weight complex functor is just the one
calculating the $H\mathbb{Z}$-homology (whose terms are free abelian groups).
In this case $g$ kills weights $m,\dots, n$ if and only if $H(g)=0$ for all $H$
represented by elements of $SH[m,n]$ (so, these morphisms form an injective
class of morphisms in the sense defined by Christensen; yet this class is not
stable with respect to shifts). Moreover, for any spectrum $M$ there exists a
""weakly universal decomposition"" $P\to M\to I_0$ for $I_0\in SH[m,n]$ and $P$
being without weights $m,\dots,n$ (so, we obtain a torsion pair). We also prove
a certain converse to the stable Hurewicz theorem.

behind this perturbation is a low-mass low-velocity fly-by encounter. The
satellite has total mass, pericentre distance and pericentric velocity of $\sim

$j \ge 3$ is an integer characterizing the resonance and $n_2$ and $n_1$ are

the TTV depends on the mass of the perturbing planet, relative to the mass of

planet. The TTVs of the two planets are approximated anti-correlated, with
phases of $\phi$ and $\approx \phi+\pi$, where the phase $\phi$ also depends on
the eccentricities and longitudes of pericenter. Therefore, the TTVs caused by
proximity to a second order mean motion resonance do not in general uniquely
determine both planet masses, eccentricities, and pericenters. This is
completely analogous to the case of TTVs induced by two planets near a first
order mean motion resonance. We explore how other TTV signals, such as the
short-period synodic TTV or a first order resonant TTV, in combination with the
second order resonant TTV, can break degeneracies. Lastly, we derive
approximate formulae for the TTVs of planets near any order eccentricity-type

holds for all eccentricity-type resonances. Our general formula reduces to
previously derived results near first order mean motion resonances.

that relies on galaxy velocity dispersions, structural parameters, and stellar

the present work is that for at least a few systems the $\delta_{IMF}$ is
heavier than the MW-like value (i.e. either top- or bottom-heavy). When
introducing tangential anisotropy, larger $\delta_{IMF}$ and smaller $f_{DM}$
are derived. Adopting a steeper concentration-mass relation than that from
simulations, we find lower $\delta_{IMF}$ ($< 1$) and larger $f_{DM}$. A
constant M/L profile with null $f_{DM}$ gives the heaviest $\delta_{IMF}$
($\sim 2$). In the MONDian framework, we find consistent results to those for
our reference NFW model. If confirmed, the large scatter of $\delta_{IMF}$ for
dEs would provide (further) evidence for a non-universal IMF in early-type
systems. On average, our reference $f_{DM}$ estimates are consistent with those
found for low-$\sigma_{e}$ ($\rm \sim 100 \, \rm km s^{-1}$) early-type
galaxies (ETGs). Furthermore, we find $f_{DM}$ consistent with values from the
SMAKCED survey, and find a double-value behavior of $f_{DM}$ with stellar mass,
which mirrors the trend of dynamical M/L and global star formation efficiency
with mass.

also degrades constraints on other cosmological parameters. Here we explore how
21 cm cosmology---as a direct probe of reionization---can be used to
independently predict $\tau$ in an effort to improve CMB parameter constraints.
We develop two complementary schemes for doing so. The first uses 21 cm power
spectrum observations in conjunction with semi-analytic simulations to predict
$\tau$. The other uses global 21 cm measurements to directly constrain low
redshift (post-reheating) contributions to $\tau$ in a relatively
model-independent way. Forecasting the performance of the upcoming Hydrogen
Epoch of Reionization Array, we find that significant reductions in the errors
on $\tau$ can be achieved. These results are particularly effective at breaking
the CMB degeneracy between $\tau$ and the amplitude of the primordial
fluctuation spectrum $A_s$, with errors on $\ln (10^{10} A_s)$ reduced by up to
a factor of four. Stage 4 CMB constraints on the neutrino mass sum are also
improved, with errors potentially reduced to $12\,\textrm{meV}$ regardless of
whether CMB experiments can precisely measure the reionization bump in
polarization power spectra. Observations of the 21 cm line are therefore
capable of improving not only our understanding of reionization astrophysics,

structure function analysis of optical light curves, we suggest that the
transient absorption is unlikely to be triggered by continuum variations.
Transient absorption components usually have low C IV equivalent widths (< 8
\AA), high ejection velocities (> 10000 \kms) and typically occur over
rest-frame timescales > 800 days. The detection rate of transient C IV
absorption seen in our sample is higher than that reported in the literature.
Using a control sample of QSOs, we show that this difference is most likely due
to the longer monitoring time-scale of sources in our sample while the effect
of small number statistics cannot be ignored. Thus, in order to establish the
role played by radio jets in driving the BAL outflows, we need a larger sample
of radio detected BALs monitored over more than 3 years in the QSO's rest
frame. We also find that the transient phenomenon in radio detected and radio
quiet BALs does not depend on any of the QSO properties i.e. the Eddington
ratio, black hole mass, bolometric luminosity and optical-to-IR colours. All
this suggests that transient BAL phenomenon is simply the extreme case of BAL

point of view that black holes evaporate by nature. We first consider a
spherical thin shell that falls in the metric of an evaporating Schwarzschild
black hole of which the radius $a(t)$ decreases in time. The important point is
that the shell can never reach $a(t)$ but it approaches $a(t)-a(t)\frac{d
a(t)}{d t}$. This situation holds at any radius because the motion of a shell
in a spherically symmetric system is not affected by the outside. In this way,
we find that the collapsing matter evaporates without forming a horizon.
Nevertheless, a Hawking-like radiation is created in the metric, and the object
looks the same as a conventional black hole from the outside. We then discuss
how the information of the matter is recovered. We also consider a black hole
that is adiabatically grown in the heat bath and obtain the interior metric. We
show that it is the self-consistent solution of $G_{\mu\nu}=8\pi G \langle
T_{\mu\nu} \rangle$ and that the four-dimensional Weyl anomaly induces the
radiation and a strong angular pressure. Finally, we analyze the internal
structures of the charged and the slowly rotating black holes.

On a theoretical
ground, the response of gas to a bar is generally thought to cause nuclear
starbursts and, possibly, AGN activity once the perturbed gas reaches the
central super-massive black hole. By means of high resolution numerical
simulations we detail the purely dynamical effects that a forming bar exerts on
the gas of an isolated disc galaxy. The galaxy is initially unstable to the
formation of non-axisymmetric structures, and within 1 Gyr it develops spiral
arms that eventually evolve into a central stellar bar on kpc scale. A first
major episode of gas inflow occurs during the formation of the spiral arms
while at later times, when the stellar bar is establishing, a low density
region is carved between the bar co-rotational and inner Lindblad resonance
radii. The development of such ""dead zone"" inhibits further massive gas
inflows. Indeed, the gas inflow reaches its maximum during the relatively fast
bar formation phase and not, as often assumed, when the bar is fully formed. We
conclude that the low efficiency of long-lived, evolved bars in driving gas
toward galactic nuclei is the reason why observational studies have failed to
establish an indisputable link between bars and AGNs. On the other hand, the
high efficiency in driving strong gas inflows of the intrinsically transient
process of bar formation suggests that the importance of bars as drivers of AGN
activity in disc galaxies has been overlooked so far. We finally prove that our
conclusions are robust against different numerical implementations of the
hydrodynamics routinely used in galaxy evolution studies.

with Standard Model particles. Such models generally assume the existence of
Standard Model particles early on, with the DM relic density a later
consequence of those interactions. Perhaps a more compelling assumption is that
DM is not part of the Standard Model sector and a population of DM too is
generated at the end of inflation. This democratic assumption does not
necessarily provide a natural value for the DM relic density, and superficially
leads to too much entropy in the dark sector. We address the latter issue by
the late decay of heavy particles produced at early times, associating the DM
relic density with the lifetime of a long-lived state. We ask what it would
take for this scenario to be compatible with observations in what we call
Flooded Dark Matter (FDM) and discuss several interesting consequences. One is
that DM can be very light and furthermore, light DM is in some sense the most
natural scenario in FDM as it is compatible with larger couplings of the
decaying particle. Moreover, the decay of the field with the smallest coupling
and hence the longest lifetime dominates the entropy and possibly the matter
content of the Universe, a principle we refer to as 'Maximum Baroqueness'. We
also show that the dark sector should be colder than the ordinary sector,
relaxing the free-streaming constraints on light DM. We will discuss the
implications for the core-cusp problem in a follow-up paper. FDM also has
interesting baryogenesis implications. One possibility is that both DM and
baryon asymmetries are simultaneously diluted by a late entropy dump.
Alternatively, FDM is compatible with an elegant non-thermal leptogenesis
implementation in which decays of a heavy RH neutrino lead to late time
reheating of the Standard Model and provide suitable conditions for creation of
a lepton asymmetry.

at four different times around periastron passage in 2009 January. The spectra
changed in shape and flux with the phase. As periastron approached, the column
density of the low-energy absorption increased, which indicates that the
emission from the wind-wind collision plasma was absorbed by the dense W-R
wind. The spectra can be mostly fitted with two different components: a warm
component with kT=0.3--0.6 keV and a dominant hot component with kT~3 keV. The
emission measure of the dominant, hot component is not inversely proportional
to the distance between the two stars. This can be explained by the O star wind
colliding before it has reached its terminal velocity, leading to a reduction
in its wind momentum flux. At phases closer to periastron, we discovered a cool
plasma component in a recombining phase, which is less absorbed. This component
may be a relic of the wind-wind collision plasma, which was cooled down by
radiation, and may represent a transitional stage in dust formation.

local energy decay statement (possibly with a finite loss of derivatives) holds
and the near region of $(\mathcal{M},g)$ satisfies some mild geometric
conditions. The latter conditions allow for $(\mathcal{M},g)$ to be the
exterior of a black hole spacetime with a non-degenerate event horizon (having
possibly complicated topology) or the exterior of a compact moving obstacle in
an ambient globally hyperbolic spacetime satisfying suitable geometric

equation $\square_{g}\psi=0$ decays at least with an inverse logarithmic rate.
This class of Lorentzian manifolds includes (non-extremal) black hole
spacetimes with no restriction on the nature of the trapped set. Spacetimes in
this class are moreover allowed to have a small ergoregion but are required to
satisfy an energy boundedness statement. Without making further assumptions,
this logarithmic decay rate is shown to be sharp. Our results can be viewed as
a generalisation of a result of Burq, dealing with the case of the wave
equation on flat space outside compact obstacles, and results of
Rodnianski--Tao for asymptotically conic product Lorentzian manifolds. The
proof will bridge ideas of Rodnianski--Tao with techniques developed in the

disc's inner parts. If the line of sight along which the system is observed has
a high inclination $I$, it intersects the disc and some absorption is produced.
As the system is not axisymmetric, the resulting light curve displays
variability. We calculate the absorption and produce light curves for different
values of the dust disc aspect ratio $H/r$ and mass of dust in the cavity
$M_{\rm dust}$. This model is applied to the high inclination ($I=85^{\circ}$)
eclipsing binary CoRoT 223992193, which shows 5-10% residual photometric
variability after the eclipses and a spot model are subtracted. We find that
such variations for $I \sim 85^{\circ}$ can be obtained for $H/r=10^{-3}$ and
$M_{\rm dust} \ge 10^{-12}$ M$_{\odot}$. For higher $H/r$, $M_{\rm dust}$ would
have to be close to this lower value and $I$ somewhat less than $85^{\circ}$.
Our results show that such variability in a system where the stars are at least
90% visible at all phases can be obtained only if absorption is produced by
dust located inside the cavity. If absorption is dominated by the parts of the
disc located close to or beyond the edge of the cavity, the stars are

thickness up to 1278 nm were formed on ABS, glass and Si substrates. Substrates
surface were prepared by oxygen plasma cleaning process. The chromium thin
film, which acts as a buffer layer, was grown by magnetron sputtering
deposition. Diamond-like carbon was deposited by pulsed-DC PECVD, with methane
and hydrogen as reactants. A Plackett-Burman experimental design was carried
out in order to determine the influence of technological parameters of the
deposition process on the thickness, deposition rate, intrinsic stress, contact
angle, roughness, friction coefficient and wear rate of the obtained coatings.
The independent variables were power, chamber pressure, time of deposition,
total flux of the gases, composition of the reactant gases and oxygen plasma
cleaning conditions. Values of intrinsic stress between 0.13-0.78 GPa were
reported. Wear resistance measurements were performed by grinding calottes with
a defined geometry. Low wear rate was achieved in the range of 1E-14 to 1E-15
m^3/Nm. The friction of the obtained coatings under different relative
humidities, ranging 20 to 80% in a nitrogen environment, was measured using a
nanotribometer with tungsten carbide ball. Results showed that friction
coefficient increases with the increasing relativity humidity. Values from 0.12
to 0.24 for friction coefficient were reported. . The main objective of the DLC
coating is to improve the wear resistance and tribological behavior of ABS in
order to increase his durability for automotive, medical, household and textile
applications, among others.

Broadband observations at all

observed with COMPTEL and INTEGRAL is still under debate and it has mostly been
attributed to the corona, although its high degree of polarization suggests it
is synchrotron radiation from a jet. The origin of the transient emission above
$\sim 100$ GeV is also unclear. We aim to disentangle the origin of the
broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of Cygnus X-1, focusing
particularly on the gamma-ray emission, and to gain information on the physical
conditions inside the jets. We develop and apply a lepto-hadronic,
inhomogeneous jet model to the non-thermal SED of Cygnus X-1. We calculate the
contributions to the SED of both protons and electrons accelerated in an
extended region of the jet. We also estimate the radiation of charged
secondaries produced in hadronic interactions, through several radiative
processes. Absorption effects are considered. We produce synthetic maps of the
jets at radio wavelengths. We find two sets of model parameters that lead to
good fits of the SED. One of the models fits all the observations, including
the MeV tail. This model also predicts hadronic gamma-ray emission slightly
below the current upper limits. The flux predicted at 8.4 GHz is in agreement
with the observations available in the literature, although the synthetic
source is more compact than the imaged radio jet. Our results show that the MeV
emission in Cygnus X-1 may be jet synchrotron radiation. This depends mainly on
the strength of the jet magnetic field and the location of the injection region
of the relativistic particles. Our calculations show that there must be
energetic electrons in the jets quite far from the black hole.

we carried out a multi-frequency (5 GHz, 19 GHz and 34 GHz) continuum study of
the region, complemented by observations of the H109$\alpha$ radio

the microwave and IR emission persists on angular scales from 3.4' to 0.4"",
although the degree of the correlation slightly decreases at higher frequencies

30% of these are positive and much greater than -0.1, consistently with a
stellar wind scenario, 3) no major evidence for inverted free-free radiation is

explain the tentative detection of Anomalous Microwave emission in RCW 49, they
emphasize the complexity of astronomical sources very well known and studied

  Problems with Curvature","This paper has been accepted by 2016 ACC",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The $k$-batch greedy strategy is an approximate algorithm to solve
optimization problems where the optimal solution is hard to obtain. Starting
with the empty set, the $k$-batch greedy strategy adds a batch of $k$ elements
to the current solution set with the largest gain in the objective function
while satisfying the constraints. In this paper, we bound the performance of
the $k$-batch greedy strategy with respect to the optimal strategy by defining
the total curvature $\alpha_k$. We show that when the objective function is
nondecreasing and submodular, the $k$-batch greedy strategy satisfies a
harmonic bound $1/(1+\alpha_k)$ for a general matroid constraint and an
exponential bound $\left(1-(1-{\alpha}_k/{t})^t\right)/{\alpha}_k$ for a
uniform matroid constraint, where $k$ divides the cardinality of the maximal
set in the general matroid, $t=K/k$ is an integer, and $K$ is the rank of the
uniform matroid. We also compare the performance of the $k$-batch greedy
strategy with that of the $k_1$-batch greedy strategy when $k_1$ divides $k$.
Specifically, we prove that when the objective function is nondecreasing and
submodular, the $k$-batch greedy strategy has better harmonic and exponential
bounds in terms of the total curvature. Finally, we illustrate our results by

electronic gap in an intermetallic compound. This Fe-based material has a very
distinctive structural characteristic with the Fe atoms occurring in dimers.
The insulating gap can be described comparably well in either the weakly
correlated limit or the strongly correlated limit within density functional
theory viewpoints, where the latter corresponds to singlet formation on the
Fe$_2$ dimers. Though most of the calculated occupied Wannier functions are an
admixture of Fe $3d$ and Ga $4s$ or $4p$ states, there is a single bonding-type
Wannier function per spin centered on each Fe$_2$ dimer. Density functional
theory methods have been applied to follow the evolution of the magnetic
properties and electronic spectrum with doping, where unusual behavior is
observed experimentally. Both electron and hole doping are considered, by Ge
and Zn on the Ga site, and by Co and Mn on the Fe site, the latter introducing
direct disturbance of the Fe$_2$ dimer. Results from weakly and strongly
correlated pictures are compared. Regardless of the method, magnetism including
itinerant phases appears readily with doping. The correlated picture suggests
that in the low doping limit Mn (for Fe) produces an in-gap hole state, while
Co (for Fe) introduces a localized electronic gap state.

Beyond a critical thickness of five ScN layers, this interface hosts spatially

$\sim$two atomic layers -- the transition metal nitride provides both gases. A
guiding concept is that the N$^{3-}$ anion should promote robust two carrier 2D
hole conduction compared to that of O$^{2-}$; metal mononitrides are mostly
metallic and even superconducting while most metal monoxides are insulating. A
second positive factor is that the density of transition metal ions, hence of a
resulting 2DG, is about three times larger for a rocksalt (111) interface than
for a perovskite(001) interface. Our results, including calculation of Hall
coefficient and thermopower for each conducting layer separately, provide
guidance for new exploration, both experimental and theoretical, on

one-to-one node mapping. Given the different outputs of LNA and GNA, when a new

transferring functional knowledge from well- to poorly-studied species between
conserved network regions. So, which one to choose, LNA or GNA? To answer this,
we introduce the first systematic evaluation of the two NA categories.
  We introduce new measures of alignment quality that allow for fair comparison

polymer melts with chains of increasing degree of polymerization, covering the
full range of behavior from the unentangled to the entangled regime. This
equation describes the motion of a group of interpenetrating polymers that are
interacting through an effective potential resulting from the many-body
coupling of the inter polymer potential inside the macromolecular liquid. The
confinement of the dynamics due to the presence of entanglements is accounted
for by an effective inter-monomer potential which is zero until the distance
between two monomers belonging to different chains reaches a characteristic
value, d. At that distance a constraint is applied through an effective
hard-core repulsion that represents the effect of entanglements in the slowing
down of the relative diffusion of the monomers. As the time evolves the
constraint relaxes due to the chain interdiffusion. The same potential acts on
both unentangled and entangled polymer chains, but short chains are not
affected as they relax faster than they experience the presence of the
potential. The comparison with Neutron Spin Echo experiments of polyethylene
melts shows quantitative agreement of the theory with the time dependent
incoherent scattering function for a variety of samples in both the unentangled

long-term subject of study and debate. The theory of radiative torques, in
which an anisotropic radiation field imparts sufficient torques to align the
grains while simultaneously spinning them to high rotational velocities, has
passed a number of observational tests. Here we use archival polarization data

at all wavelengths out to radii of 1.5 arcminutes centered on the BNKL object

Here, we show experimental evidence that thermal effects also dominate the

used in our experiments has a large optical mode area of ~100 {\mu}m$^2$, and
hence its 10 ms thermal time constant filters the close-to-carrier optical
frequency noise. The result is an absolute laser linewidth of 240 Hz with a
corresponding white-frequency noise floor of 0.1 Hz$^2$/Hz. We explain the

noise that is common to many microresonator devices due to the inherent

dynamical cooperativity relates to increasing energy barriers to mode
diffusion. The accuracy of the LE4PD is verified by analyzing the predicted

scheduling and observation effect information leakage properties. In
particular, that scheduling can hide some leaked information from perfect

appropriate adjustments to the parameters of the $P-V$ curve. Using Clausius's
formalism, we show that entropy production, $\Delta S$, is related to the
hysteresis area, $\Delta A$, enclosed by the $P-V$ curve during a breathing
cycle, namely, $\Delta S=\Delta A/T$, where $T$ is the body temperature.
Although $\Delta A$ is highly dependent on the disease, such formula applies to
healthy as well as diseased lungs, regardless of the disease stage. Finally, we
use {\it ansatzs} to predict analytically the entropy produced by the fibrotic
and emphysematous lungs.

(FBMC/OQAM) has been heavily studied as an alternative waveform for 5G systems.
Its advantages of higher spectrum efficiency, localized frequency response and
insensitivity to synchronization errors may enable promising performance when
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) fails. However, performing
channel estimation under the intrinsic interference has been a fundamental
obstacle towards adopting FBMC/OQMA in a practical system. Several schemes are
available but the performance is far from satisfaction. In this paper, we will
show the existing methods are trapped by the paradigm that a clean pilot is
mandatory so as to explicitly carry a reference symbol to the receiver for the
purpose of channel estimation. By breaking this paradigm, a novel dual
dependent pilot scheme is proposed, which gives up the independent pilot and
derives dual pilots from the imposed interference. By doing this, the
interference between pilots can be fully utilized. Consequentially, the new
scheme significantly outperforms existing solutions and the simulation results
show FBMC/OQAM can achieve close-to-OFDM performance in a practical system even
with the presence of strong intrinsic interference.

between debris discs and planetary companions. However, simulations throughout
the literature have been conducted with various initial conditions often with
little or no justification. In this paper, we aim to study the dependence on
the initial conditions of N-body simulations modelling the interaction between
a massive and eccentric planet on an exterior debris disc. To achieve this, we
first classify three broad approaches used in the literature and provide some
physical context for when each category should be used. We then run a series of
N-body simulations, that include radiation forces acting on small grains, with
varying initial conditions across the three categories. We test the influence
of the initial parent body belt width, eccentricity, and alignment with the
planet on the resulting debris disc structure and compare the final peak
emission location, disc width and offset of synthetic disc images produced with
a radiative transfer code. We also track the evolution of the forced
eccentricity of the dust grains induced by the planet, as well as resonance
dust trapping. We find that an initially broad parent body belt always results
in a broader debris disc than an initially narrow parent body belt. While
simulations with a parent body belt with low initial eccentricity (e ~ 0) and
high initial eccentricity (0 < e < 0.3) resulted in similar broad discs, we
find that purely secular forced initial conditions, where the initial disc
eccentricity is set to the forced value and the disc is aligned with the
planet, always result in a narrower disc. We conclude that broad debris discs
can be modelled by using either a dynamically cold or dynamically warm parent
belt, while in contrast eccentric narrow debris rings are reproduced using a
secularly forced parent body belt.

described by the Landau hydrodynamic model and further revised by the
contributions of the small target/projectile sources. In the calculation, to
avoid the errors caused by an unapt conversion or non-division, the rapidity

results are in agreement with the available experimental data at relativistic

$\mathscr{X}$ is a compensated-covariation stable family of square integrable
martingales such that $\langle{X},{Y}\rangle$ is deterministic for all
$X,Y\in\mathscr{X}$ and, furthermore, the system of monomials generated by

then $\mathscr{X}$ possesses the chaotic representation property. We shall
apply this result to the case of L\'evy processes. Relative to the filtration
generated by a L\'evy process, we construct families of martingales which
possess the chaotic representation property. As an illustration of the general
results, we will also discuss applications to continuous Gaussian families of
martingales and independent families of compensated Poisson processes. We
conclude the paper by giving, for the case of L\'evy processes, several

Within the framework of the t-J model an approach to solving a problem of
account of both strong electron correlations and local electron-phonon binding
with characteristic Einstein mode $\omega _0$ in the normal state has been
presented. In approximation Hubbard-I it was found an exact solution to the
polaron bands. We established that in the low-dimensional system with a pure
kinematic part of Hamiltonian a complicated excitation spectrum is realized. It
is determined mainly by peculiarities of the lattice Green's function. In the
definite area of the electron concentration and hopping integrals a correlation
gap may be possible on the Fermi level. Also, in specific cases it is observed
a doping evolution of the Fermi surface. We found that the strong
electron-phonon binding enforces a degree of coherence of electron-polaron
excitations near the Fermi level and spectrum along the nodal direction depends
on wave vector module weakly. It corresponds to ARPES data. A possible origin
of the experimentally observed kink in the nodal direction of cuprates is
explained by fine structure of the polaron band to be formed near the mode
-$\omega _0$.

String searching
has been extensively studied since the inception of computer science.
Increasingly many applications have to deal with imprecise strings or strings
with fuzzy information in them. String matching becomes a probabilistic event
when a string contains uncertainty, i.e. each position of the string can have
different probable characters with associated probability of occurrence for
each character. Such uncertain strings are prevalent in various applications
such as biological sequence data, event monitoring and automatic ECG
annotations. We explore the problem of indexing uncertain strings to support
efficient string searching. In this paper we consider two basic problems of
string searching, namely substring searching and string listing. In substring
searching, the task is to find the occurrences of a deterministic string in an
uncertain string. We formulate the string listing problem for uncertain
strings, where the objective is to output all the strings from a collection of
strings, that contain probable occurrence of a deterministic query string.
Indexing solution for both these problems are significantly more challenging
for uncertain strings than for deterministic strings. Given a construction time
probability value $\tau$, our indexes can be constructed in linear space and
supports queries in near optimal time for arbitrary values of probability
threshold parameter greater than $\tau$. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first indexing solution for searching in uncertain strings that achieves
strong theoretical bound and supports arbitrary values of probability threshold
parameter. We also propose an approximate substring search index that can
answer substring search queries with an additive error in optimal time. We
conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of our indexes.

Using granular packing as a model hard-sphere glass, we show the glass
transition as a thermodynamic phase transition with a ""hidden"" polytetrahedral
order. This polytetrahedral order is spatially correlated with the slow
dynamics. It is geometrically frustrated and has a peculiar fractal dimension.
Additionally, as the packing fraction increases, its growth follows an

fundamental concepts such as representations are not formally defined --
researchers ""know them when they see them"" -- and there is no common language
for describing and analyzing algorithms. This essay proposes an abstract
framework that identifies the essential features of current practice and may
provide a foundation for future developments.
  The backbone of almost all deep learning algorithms is backpropagation, which
is simply a gradient computation distributed over a neural network. The main
ingredients of the framework are thus, unsurprisingly: (i) game theory, to
formalize distributed optimization; and (ii) communication protocols, to track
the flow of zeroth and first-order information. The framework allows natural
definitions of semantics (as the meaning encoded in functions), representations
(as functions whose semantics is chosen to optimized a criterion) and grammars
(as communication protocols equipped with first-order convergence guarantees).
  Much of the essay is spent discussing examples taken from the literature. The
ultimate aim is to develop a graphical language for describing the structure of
deep learning algorithms that backgrounds the details of the optimization
procedure and foregrounds how the components interact. Inspiration is taken
from probabilistic graphical models and factor graphs, which capture the
essential structural features of multivariate distributions.

diagrammatic perturbation series to all orders and thus obtain explicit
expressions for physical quantities such as the spectral density and the
scattering matrix. In the two-excitation sector, we show that strictly linear
dispersion relations exhibit the special property that the corresponding
diagrammatic perturbation series terminates after two terms, again allowing for
closed-form expressions for physical quantities. In the case of general
dispersion relations, notably those exhibiting a band edge or waveguide cut-off
frequencies, the perturbation series cannot be summed explicitly. Instead, we
derive a self-consistent T-matrix equation that reduces the computational
effort to that of a single-excitation computation. This analysis allows us to
identify a Fano resonance between the occupied quantum impurity and a free
photon in the waveguide as a unique signature of the few-photon nonlinearity
inherent in such systems. In addition, our diagrammatic approach allows for the
classification of different physical processes such as the creation of
photon-photon correlations and interaction-induced radiation trapping - the
latter being absent for strictly linear dispersion relations. Our framework can
serve as the basis for further studies that involve more complex scenarios such

structure and easy random number generation thanks to known
marginal/conditional distributions. Existing discrete circular distributions
strongly depend on the initial direction and orientation, i.e. a change of the
reference system on the circle may lead to misleading inferential results. We
investigate the invariance properties, i.e. invariance under change of initial
direction and of the reference system orientation, for several continuous and
discrete distributions. We prove that the introduced IWP distribution satisfies
these two crucial properties. We estimate parameters in a Bayesian framework
and provide all computational details to implement the algorithm. Inferential
issues related to the invariance properties are discussed through numerical
examples on artificial and real data.

the emergence of a typical vortex length scale, distinctly different from the

reported experimentally for puller (pusher) microorganisms.

Newton's apsidal precession theorem has been extensively studied by

Mercury, the dynamics of galaxies, the vortex dynamics, the JWKB quantisation

proof of this statement is available.
  In this paper central force systems with $f(r)\sim \mu r^{-(\alpha+1)}$ are

find that the target is not variable in any dataset above the error levels
~0.07 mags. The presence of the interloper might explain the non-detection of
the classic ellipsoidal modulation; our data indicates that it contributes
around half of the total flux, which would make a variation <0.15 mags not
detectable. A single spectrum obtained in 2004 May shows the H-alpha emission
characteristic of X-ray transients in quiescence with a full-width-half-maximum

Typically, these networks consist of a very large number of lossy and

design. In this context the Trickle algorithm plays an important role, serving
as the basic mechanism for message dissemination in notable protocols such as
RPL and MPL. While Trickle's broadcast suppression mechanism has been proven to
be efficient, recent work has shown that it is intrinsically unfair in terms of
load distribution and that its performance relies strongly on network topology.
This can lead to increased end-to-end delays (MPL), or creation of sub-optimal
routes (RPL). Furthermore, as highlighted in this work, there is no clear
consensus within the research community about what the proper parameter
settings of the suppression mechanism should be. We propose an extension to the
Trickle algorithm, called adaptive-k, which allows nodes to individually adapt
their suppression mechanism to local node density. Supported by analysis and a
case study with RPL, we show that this extension allows for an easier
configuration of Trickle, making it more robust to network topology.

a parameter $\beta$ between 1 and 2. In spite of their simple definition, they
are not yet well understood. We study their two-dimensional density which
exists by a theorem of Solomyak. To each Bernoulli convolution, there is an
interval $D$ called the overlap region, and a map which assigns two values to
each point of $D$ and one value to all other points of $[0,1].$ There are two
types of finite orbits of these multivalued maps which correspond to zeros and
potential singularities of the density, respectively.
  Orbits which do not meet $D$ belong to an ordinary map called
$\beta$-transformation and exist for all $\beta>1.6182.$ They were studied by
Erd\""os, J\'oo, Komornik, Sidorov, de Vries and others as points with unique
addresses, and by Jordan, Shmerkin and Solomyak as points with maximal local
dimension. In the two-dimensional view, these orbits form address curves
related to the Milnor-Thurston itineraries in one-dimensional dynamics. The
curves depend smoothly on the parameter and represent quantiles of all
corresponding Bernoulli convolutions.
  Finite orbits which intersect $D$ have a network-like structure and can exist
only at Perron parameters $\beta.$ Their points are intersections of extended
address curves, and can have finite or countable number of addresses, as found
by Sidorov. For an uncountable number of parameters, the central point
$\frac12$ has only two addresses. The intersection of periodic address curves
can lead to singularities of the measures. We give examples which are not Pisot
or Salem parameters.
  It seems that all singularities of Bernoulli convolutions are related to
network-like orbits. The paper is self-contained and includes many
illustrations.

is a difficult challenge that requires accuracy both in the occulted star
position as for the object ephemeris. Until now, the most used method of
prediction involving tens of TNOs/Centaurs was to consider a constant offset
for the right ascension and for the declination with respect to a reference
ephemeris. This offset is determined as the difference between the most recent
observations of the TNO and the reference ephemeris. This method can be
successfully applied when the offset remains constant with time. This paper
presents an alternative method of prediction based on a new accurate orbit
determination procedure, which uses all the available positions of the TNO from
the Minor Planet Center database plus sets of new astrometric positions from
unpublished observations. The orbit determination is performed through a
numerical integration procedure (NIMA), in which we develop a specific
weighting scheme. The NIMA method was applied for 51 selected TNOs/Centaurs.
For this purpose, we have performed about 2900 new observations during
2007-2014. Using NIMA, we succeed in predicting the stellar occultations of 10
TNOs and 3 Centaurs between 2013 and 2015. By comparing the NIMA and JPL
ephemerides, we highlighted the variation of the offset between them with time.
Giving examples, we show that the constant offset method could not accurately
predict 6 out of the 13 observed positive occultations successfully predicted
by NIMA. The results indicate that NIMA is capable of efficiently refine the
orbits of these bodies. Finally, we show that the astrometric positions given
by positive occultations can help to further refine the orbit of the TNO and
consequently the future predictions. We also provide the unpublished
observations of the 51 selected TNOs and their ephemeris in a usable format by
the SPICE library.

object is a Hopf algebra which is naturally defined on non-commuting sources,
and the fact that its genuine unshuffle coproduct splits into left- and right
unshuffle half-coproduts. The latter give rise to the notion of unshuffle
bialgebra. This setting allows to describe the relation between planar full and

modification of this linear fixed point equation gives rise to the relation
between planar connected and one-particle irreducible Green's functions. The
graphical calculus that arises from this approach also leads to a new
understanding of functional calculus in planar QFT, whose rules for
differentiation with respect to non-commuting sources can be translated into

magneto-seismology (SMS) allows us to infer the background properties of these
structures. Here, we aim to identify properties of the observed
magneto-acoustic waves and study the background properties of magnetic
structures within the lower solar atmosphere. Using the Dutch Open Telescope
(DOT) and Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instruments, we
captured two series of high-resolution intensity images with short cadence of
two isolated magnetic pores. Combining wavelet analysis and empirical mode
decomposition (EMD), we determined characteristic periods within the
cross-sectional (i.e., area) and intensity time series. Then, by applying the
theory of linear magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we identified the mode of these
oscillations within the MHD framework. Several oscillations have been detected
within these two magnetic pores. Their periods range from 3 to 20 minutes.
Combining wavelet analysis and EMD enables us to confidently find the phase
difference between the area and intensity oscillations. From these observed
features, we concluded that the detected oscillations can be classified as slow
sausage MHD waves. Further, we determined several key properties of these
oscillations such as the radial velocity perturbation, magnetic field
perturbation and vertical wavenumber using solar magnetoseismology. The
estimated range of the related wavenumbers reveals that these oscillations are
trapped within these magnetic structures. Our results suggest that the detected
oscillations are standing harmonics, and, this allows us to estimate the
expansion factor of the waveguides by employing SMS. The calculated expansion
factor ranges from 4-12.

formalism is derived and discussed in a general context, starting from a
three-body Hamiltonian. Links to existing many-body techniques such as the
formalism of Green's functions are established. First applications are done

emission at multiple wavelengths to produce resolution-enhanced image cubes of
differential column-density as a function of dust temperature and position.
PPMAP is based on the generic 'point process' formalism, whereby the system of
interest (in this case, a dusty astrophysical structure such as a filament or
prestellar core) is represented by a collection of points in a suitably defined
state space. It can be applied to a variety of observational data, such as
Herschel images, provided only that the image intensity is delivered by
optically thin dust in thermal equilibrium. PPMAP takes full account of the
instrumental point spread functions and does not require all images to be
degraded to the same resolution. We present the results of testing using
simulated data for a prestellar core and a fractal turbulent cloud, and
demonstrate its performance with real data from the Hi-GAL survey.
Specifically, we analyse observations of a large filamentary structure in the
CMa OB1 giant molecular cloud. Histograms of differential column-density
indicate that the warm material (T > 13 K) is distributed log-normally,
consistent with turbulence, but the column-densities of the cooler material are
distributed as a high density tail, consistent with the effects of
self-gravity. The results illustrate the potential of PPMAP to aid in
distinguishing between different physical components along the line of sight in
star-forming clouds, and aid the interpretation of the associated PDFs of
column density.

neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) using the unique, high-quality source of
tens-of-MeV neutrinos provided by the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). In spite of its large cross section, the
CEvNS process has never been observed, due to tiny energies of the resulting
nuclear recoils which are out of reach for standard neutrino detectors. The
measurement of CEvNS has now become feasible, thanks to the development of
ultra-sensitive technology for rare decay and weakly-interacting massive
particle (dark matter) searches. The CEvNS cross section is cleanly predicted
in the standard model; hence its measurement provides a standard model test. It
is relevant for supernova physics and supernova-neutrino detection, and enables
validation of dark-matter detector background and detector-response models. In
the long term, precision measurement of CEvNS will address questions of nuclear
structure. COHERENT will deploy multiple detector technologies in a phased
approach: a 14-kg CsI[Na] scintillating crystal, 15 kg of p-type point-contact
germanium detectors, and 100 kg of liquid xenon in a two-phase time projection
chamber. Following an extensive background measurement campaign, a location in
the SNS basement has proven to be neutron-quiet and suitable for deployment of
the COHERENT detector suite. The simultaneous deployment of the three COHERENT
detector subsystems will test the $N^2$ dependence of the cross section and
ensure an unambiguous discovery of CEvNS. This document describes concisely the
COHERENT physics motivations, sensitivity and plans for measurements at the SNS
to be accomplished on a four-year timescale.

the dip vary by a factor of only 2-4 at odds with the eclipses of other HMXBs,
where the intensity drops upto two orders of magnitude. The orbital intensity
profile of 4U 0114+65 is characterized by a narrow dip in the RXTE-ASM (2-12
\rm{keV}) light curve and a shallower one in the Swift-BAT (15-50 \rm{keV}),
which is different from eclipse ingress/egress behaviour of other HMXBs. The
time-resolved spectral analysis reveal moderate absorption column density
(N$_{H}$ - 2-20 $\times$ $10^{22}$ atoms $cm^{-2}$) and a relatively low
equivalent width ($\sim$ 30 \rm{eV} \& 12 \rm{eV} of the iron K$_\alpha$ and
K$_\beta$ lines respectively) as opposed to the typical X-ray spectra of HMXBs
during eclipse where the equivalent width is $\sim$ 1 \rm{keV}. Both XIS and

even in equilibrium,makes it hard to understand the relation between various
MCT approaches for sheared steady states as well as their regime of validity.
Here we try to understand these approximations indirectly by deriving the MCT
equations through two different approaches for a colloidal system under shear,
first, through a microscopic approach, as suggested by Zaccarelli et al, and
second, through fluctuating hydrodynamics, where the approximations used in the
derivation are quite clear. The qualitative similarity of our theory with a
number of existing theories show that linear response theory might play a role
in various approximations employed in deriving those theories and one needs to
be careful while applying them for systems arbitrarily far away from
equilibrium, such as a granular system or when shear is very strong. As a
byproduct of our calculation, we obtain the extension of Yvon-Born-Green (YBG)
equation for a sheared system and under the assumption of random-phase
approximation, the YBG equation yields the distorted structure factor that was
earlier obtained through different approaches.

magnetically dominated flows, whose magnetic power is progressively converted
to kinetic power of of the matter of the jet, until equipartition is reached.
Therefore, at the end of the acceleration phase, the jet should still carry a
substantial fraction ($\approx$ half) of its power in the form of a Poynting
flux. It has been also argued that, in these conditions, the best candidate
particle acceleration mechanism is efficient reconnection of magnetic field
lines, for which it is predicted that magnetic field and accelerated
relativistic electron energy densities are in equipartition.Through the
modeling of the jet non--thermal emission, we explore if equipartition is
indeed possible in BL Lac objects, i.e. low-power blazars with weak or absent
broad emission lines. We find that one-zone models (for which only one region
is involved in the production of the radiation we observe) the particle energy
density is largely dominating (by 1-2 orders of magnitude) over the magnetic
one. As a consequence, the jet kinetic power largely exceeds the magnetic
power. Instead, if the jet is structured (i.e. made by a fast spine surrounded
by a slower layer), the amplification of the IC emission due to the radiative
interplay between the two components allows us to reproduce the emission in
equipartition conditions.

monitor the astrometric motion of the L4.5 dwarf 2M1821$+$14 over 17 months.
The astrometric residuals of eleven epochs have a r.m.s. dispersion of 0.4 mas,
which is larger than the average precision of 0.23 mas per epoch and hints
towards an additional signal or excess noise. Comparison of the
point-spread-functions in OSIRIS and FORS2/VLT images reveals no differences
critical for high-precision astrometry, despite the GTC's segmented primary
mirror. We attribute the excess noise to an unknown effect that may be
uncovered with additional data. For 2M1821$+$14, we measured a relative
parallax of $106.15 \pm 0.18$ mas and determined a correction of $0.50\pm0.05$
mas to absolute parallax, leading to a distance of $9.38 \pm0.03$ pc. We
excluded at 3-$\sigma$ confidence the presence of a companion to 2M1821$+$14
down to a mass ratio of 0.1 ($\approx 5\, M_\mathrm{Jupiter}$) with a period of
50--1000 days and a separation of 0.1--0.7 au. The accurate parallax allowed us
to estimate the age and mass of 2M1821$+$14 of 120--700 Myr and
0.049$^{+0.014}_{-0.024}$ M$_\odot$, thus confirming its intermediate age and
substellar mass. We complement our study with a parallax and proper motion
catalogue of 587 stars ($i'\simeq15.5-22$) close to 2M1821$+$14, used as
astrometric references. This study demonstrates sub-mas astrometry with the
GTC, a capability applicable for a variety of science cases including the

compatible with the previous value given by CODATA-2010, which, on its turn,
essentially relies on measurements of the electron-proton interaction. The
proton's new size was extracted from the 2S-2P Lamb shift in the muonic
hydrogen, which showed an energy excess of 0.3 meV in comparison to the
theoretical prediction, evaluated with the CODATA radius. Higher-dimensional
gravity is a candidate to explain this discrepancy, since the muon-proton
gravitational interaction is stronger than the electron-proton interaction and,
in the context of braneworld models, the gravitational potential can be hugely
amplified in short distances when compared to the Newtonian potential.
Motivated by these ideas, we study a muonic hydrogen confined in a thick brane.
We show that the muon-proton gravitational interaction modified by extra
dimensions can provide the additional separation of 0.3 meV between 2S and 2P
states. In this scenario, the gravitational energy depends on the
higher-dimensional Planck mass and indirectly on the brane thickness. Studying
the behavior of the gravitational energy with respect to the brane thickness in
a realistic range, we find constraints for the fundamental Planck mass that
solve the proton radius puzzle and are consistent with previous experimental
bounds.

  The algorithm is non iterative and always halts successfully and the

can take care of new points from where it left off.At some later stage if the
dimension of the data is increased from n to n+r, the algorithm can still
continue from where it left off, after some simple adjustments, and tackle the
new data points which are of a higher dimension. and separate them. The
computational complexity is O(n.N log(N)) + O(n3 log(N)), where N is the given
number of points and n3 is the cube of n - the dimension of space. The
algorithm is made possible because a new concept called Orientation Vector is
used. This vector is a Hamming vector and is associated with each point and has

points are separate or not when among a collection of planes.Its application to
data retrieval problems in very large medical data bases is also given.

caused by significant changes in magnetic field topology that would inhibit

stars in Wood et al's sample that had their surface magnetic fields
reconstructed through Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI). Although the solar-like
outliers in the $\dot{M}$ -- $F_x$ relation have higher fractional toroidal
magnetic energy, we do not find evidence of a sharp transition in magnetic
topology at $F_{x,6}$. To confirm this, further wind measurements and ZDI
observations at both sides of the break are required. As active stars can jump
between states with highly toroidal to highly poloidal fields, we expect
significant scatter in magnetic field topology to exist for stars with $F_x
\gtrsim F_{x,6}$. This strengthens the importance of multi-epoch ZDI
observations. Finally, we show that there is a correlation between $F_x$ and
magnetic energy, which implies that $\dot{M}$ -- magnetic energy relation has
the same qualitative behaviour as the original $\dot{M}$ -- $F_x$ relation. No

distribution in the heliosphere. This model takes into account the temporal and
heliolatitudinal variations of the solar parameters as well as non-Maxwellian
kinetic properties of the hydrogen distribution due to charge exchange in the

the IBEX-Lo data and the modeling results obtained with the three-dimensional,
time-dependent model. Namely, the model predicts a larger count rate in energy
bin~2 (20-41 eV) than in energy bin~1 (11-21 eV), while the data shows the
opposite case. We perform study of the model parameter effects on the IBEX-Lo
fluxes and the ratio of fluxes in two energy channels. We shown that the most
important parameter, which has a major influence on the ratio of the fluxes in
the two energy bins, is the solar radiation pressure. The parameter fitting
procedure shows that the best agreement between the model result and the data
occurs in the case when the ratio of the solar radiation pressure to the solar

drones, have been adopted as part of a new logistic method in the commercial
sector called ""last-mile delivery"". In this novel approach, they are deployed
alongside trucks to deliver goods to customers to improve the quality of
service and reduce the transportation cost. This approach gives rise to a new
variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called TSP with drone (TSP-D).
A variant of this problem that aims to minimize the time at which truck and
drone finish the service (or, in other words, to maximize the quality of
service) was studied in the work of Murray and Chu (2015). In contrast, this
paper considers a new variant of TSP-D in which the objective is to minimize
operational costs including total transportation cost and one created by waste
time a vehicle has to wait for the other. The problem is first formulated
mathematically. Then, two algorithms are proposed for the solution. The first
algorithm (TSP-LS) was adapted from the approach proposed by Murray and Chu
(2015), in which an optimal TSP solution is converted to a feasible TSP-D
solution by local searches. The second algorithm, a Greedy Randomized Adaptive
Search Procedure (GRASP), is based on a new split procedure that optimally
splits any TSP tour into a TSP-D solution. After a TSP-D solution has been
generated, it is then improved through local search operators. Numerical
results obtained on various instances of both objective functions with
different sizes and characteristics are presented. The results show that GRASP
outperforms TSP-LS in terms of solution quality under an acceptable running
time.

wireless devices transmit data to the cloud frequently. However, the wireless
medium access is pointed as a problem for the next generations of wireless
networks; hence, the number of data transmissions in Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSNs) can quickly become a bottleneck, disrupting the exponential growth in
the number of interconnected devices, sensors, and amount of produced data.
Therefore, keeping a low number of data transmissions is critical to
incorporate new sensor nodes and measure a great variety of parameters in
future generations of WSNs. Thanks to the high accuracy and low complexity of
state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms, Dual Prediction Schemes (DPSs) are
potential candidates to optimize the data transmissions in WSNs at the finest
level because they facilitate for sensor nodes to avoid unnecessary
transmissions without affecting the quality of their measurements. In this
work, we present a sensor network model that uses statistical theorems to
describe the expected impact of DPSs and data aggregation in WSNs. We aim to
provide a foundation for future works by characterizing the theoretical gains
of processing data in sensors and conditioning its transmission to the
predictions' accuracy. Our simulation results show that the number of
transmissions can be reduced by almost 98% in the sensor nodes with the highest
workload. We also detail the impact of predicting and aggregating transmissions
according to the parameters that can be observed in common scenarios, such as
sensor nodes' transmission ranges, the correlation between measurements of
different sensors, and the period between two consecutive measurements in a
sensor.

sample the misalignment is always small (usually within $3^\circ$) for radii
between 7 and 12 kpc. The velocity anisotropy is very radially biased ($\beta
\approx 0.7$), and almost invariant across the volume in our study. Finally, we
construct a triaxial stellar halo in a triaxial NFW dark matter halo using a
made-to-measure method. Despite the triaxiality of the potential, the velocity
ellipsoid of the stellar halo is nearly spherically aligned within
$\sim6^\circ$ for large regions of space, particularly outside the scale radius
of the stellar halo. We conclude that the second velocity moment ellipsoid can
be close to spherically aligned for a much wider class of potentials than the
strong constraints that arise from exact alignment might suggest.

problem, and further aims to define and measure the main factors that caused
the growth of eSports. To further enhance the growth, the benefits and
disbenefits of implementing Information Technology Management tools is
appraised, which additionally gives an understanding of the future of eSports.
  Through observation of the data collection, the themes games played, games
genre, and single-player or team-player was deemed most important. A
statistical analysis was additionally done on the numerical data, which showed
significant correlation between the themes prize pool, participants and
participating countries towards live audience. This indicates that the
mentioned themes affect how many people attends live eSport event. The analysis
also consists of a trend analysis, which presents that nearly every theme
analysed will continue to grow in a five-year period. The trend analysis
further expects a 305.51% growth in the live audience from 2014-2019, while the
virtual streaming audience is expected to experience a growth of 140.61%. To
enhance this growth, the research thesis recommends using the presented trends

directly from $\pi\pi$ scattering data. As the latter accounts at once for all
effects associated with resonances, intermediate $K\bar{K}$ loops, and other
possible inelasticities present in $\pi\pi$ scattering, the need of modeling is
restricted to $\cal{K}_W$ only. The procedure proposed allows one to asses the

threshold. Even the simplest vector-meson-dominance choice for $\cal{K}_W$
already yields a good qualitative description of $F_V^{\pi\pi}$. The energy
sector below $0.8$ GeV is quite well reproduced when a precise theoretical
chiral perturbation $\pi\pi$ amplitude is used as input, together with the
single free parameter $F_V G_V/F^2=1.20$. The inclusion of kaon loops, along
well established lines and using few parameters, produces a good description of
the form factor in the entire energy range allowed by $\tau$ decays. This
indicates that the replacement of modeling by direct empirical scattering

(NS), as indicated by the orbital eccentricity of the system (e=0.11), then its
mass is the smallest precisely measured for any such object. The pulsar has a
spin period of 45.7 ms and a spin derivative of 1.8616(7) x$10^-19$; from these
we derive a characteristic age of ~ 4.1 x $10^9$ years and a magnetic field of
~ 2.9 x $10^9$ G,i.e, this pulsar was mildly recycled by accretion of matter
from the progenitor of the companion star. This suggests that it was formed
with (very approximately) its current mass. Thus NSs form with a wide range of

is also important for the search for gravitational waves released during a

density and zero leakage. However, STT-MRAMs suffer from poor reliability due
to shared read and write paths. Additionally, conflicting requirements for data
retention and write-ability (both related to the energy barrier height of the
magnet) makes design more challenging. Furthermore, the energy barrier height
depends on the physical dimensions of the free layer. Any variations in the
dimensions of the free layer lead to variations in the energy barrier height.
In order to address poor reliability of STT-MRAMs, usage of Error Correcting
Codes (ECC) have been proposed. Unlike traditional CMOS memory technologies,
ECC is expected to correct both soft and hard errors in STT_MRAMs. To achieve
acceptable yield with low write power, stronger ECC is required, resulting in
increased number of encoded bits and degraded memory efficiency. In this paper,
we propose Failure aware ECC (FaECC), which masks permanent faults while
maintaining the same correction capability for soft errors without increased
encoded bits. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of process variations on
run-time reliability of STT-MRAMs. We provide an analysis on the impact of
process variations on the life-time of the free layer and retention failures.
In order to analyze the effectiveness of our methodology, we developed a
cross-layer simulation framework that consists of device, circuit and array
level analysis of STT-MRAM memory arrays. Our results show that using FaECC
relaxes the requirements on the energy barrier height, which reduces the write
energy and results in smaller access transistor size and memory array area.

persists for approximately one hundred femtoseconds. We propose that the

resources for bipartite one-way protocols, specifically EPR-steering with qubit
measurements. Steering is relevant for one-sided device-independent key
distribution, the realistic implementations of which necessitate the study of
noisy scenarios. So far mainly the case of imperfect detection efficiency has
been considered; here we look at the effect of dynamical noise responsible for
decoherence and dissipation. In order to set up the optimisation, we map the
steering problem into the equivalent joint measurability problem, and employ
quantum resource-theoretic robustness monotones from that context. The
advantage is that incompatibility (hence steerability) with arbitrary pairs of
noisy qubit measurements has been completely characterised through an
analytical expression, which can be turned into a computable cost function with
exact gradient. Furthermore, dynamical loss of incompatibility has recently
been illustrated using these monotones. We demonstrate resource control
numerically using a special gradient-based software, showing, in particular,
the advantage over naive control with cost function chosen as a fidelity in
relation to a specific target. We subsequently illustrate the complexity of the
control landscapes with a simplified two-variable scheme. The results
contribute to the theoretical understanding of the limitations in realistic
implementations of quantum information protocols, also paving way to practical
use of the rather abstract quantum resource theories.

and probability density functions (PDFs). The principal stochastic moments
(standard deviation, mean and skewness) are calculated and compared with those
determined from a stochastic perturbation theory described previously by Moon
and Wettlaufer (2013). We examine in detail the competing roles of the
destabilizing sea ice-albedo-feedback and the stabilizing long-wave radiative
loss contributions to the variability of the ice cover under increased
greenhouse-gas forcing. In particular, the variability of the stochastic paths
at the end of summer shows a clear maximum, which is due to the combination of
the increasing importance of the albedo-feedback and its associated ""memory
effect"" that accumulates from early spring to late summer. This is
counterbalanced by the stabilization of the ice cover due to the longwave loss
of energy from the ice surface, which is enhanced during winter, thereby
focusing the stochastic paths and decreasing the variability in winter. The
organizing principle for the interpretation of these effects is a generalized
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with a time dependent potential.

Such a minimum speed, unattainable by particles, represents a preferred
reference frame associated with a background field that breaks down the Lorentz
symmetry. The metric of the flat space-time shall include the presence of a
uniform vacuum energy density, which leads to a negative pressure at

  Set Switching",,,,,"cs.SY math.DS math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The chattering response at the MRP shadow set switching point for the
controlled attitude dynamics of a rigid tumbling spacecraft using delayed state
feedback control with MRPs is investigated, where the time delay is assumed to
be in the measurement of the state. In addition, a strategy to reduce or
completely avoid the chattering phenomena using a hysteretic boundary layer
switching rule is employed. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the
chattering phenomenon and the advantages of the modified MRP shadow set
switching rule.

gauge groups is discussed. Contraction parameters of gauge group $SU(2)$ of
Electroweak Model and gauge group $SU(3)$ of Quantum Chromodynamics are taken
identical and tending to zero when temperature increase. Properties of the
elementary particles change drastically at the infinite temperature limit: all
particles lose masses, all quarks are monochromatic. Electroweak interactions
become long-range and are mediated by the neutral currents. Particles of
different kind do not interact. It looks like some stratification with only one
sort of particles in each stratum. The Standard Model passes in this limit
through several stages, which are distinguished by the powers of contraction
parameter. For any stage the intermediate models are constructed and the exact
expressions for the respective Lagrangians are presented. The developed
approach describes the evolution of Standard Model in the early Universe from
the Big Bang up to the end of several nanoseconds.
