of many-particle operators and their uncertainty product for an
out-of-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can deviate from the outcome
of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics, even in the limit of infinite
number of particles and at constant interaction parameter when the system
becomes 100% condensed. We demonstrate our finding on the dynamics of the
center-of-mass position--momentum uncertainty product of a freely expanding as
well as of a trapped BEC. This time-dependent many-body phenomenon is explained
by the existence of time-dependent correlations which manifest themselves in
the system's reduced two-body density matrix used to evaluate the uncertainty
product. Our work demonstrates that one has to use a many-body propagation
theory to describe an out-of-equilibrium BEC, even in the infinite particle
limit.

  arXiv:1502.01687",,,,"cs.DS cs.NE cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The independent set problem is NP-hard and particularly difficult to solve in
large sparse graphs. In this work, we develop an advanced evolutionary
algorithm, which incorporates kernelization techniques to compute large
independent sets in huge sparse networks. A recent exact algorithm has shown
that large networks can be solved exactly by employing a branch-and-reduce
technique that recursively kernelizes the graph and performs branching.
However, one major drawback of their algorithm is that, for huge graphs,
branching still can take exponential time. To avoid this problem, we
recursively choose vertices that are likely to be in a large independent set
(using an evolutionary approach), then further kernelize the graph. We show
that identifying and removing vertices likely to be in large independent sets
opens up the reduction space---which not only speeds up the computation of
large independent sets drastically, but also enables us to compute high-quality
independent sets on much larger instances than previously reported in the
literature.

position correlations are well defined. Nevertheless, Bohmian mechanics
predicts the violation of Bell inequalities. Motivated by this fact we
investigate position measurements in Bohmian mechanics by coupling the
particles to macroscopic pointers. This explains the violation of Bell
inequalities despite 2-time position correlations. We relate this fact to
so-called surrealistic trajectories that, in our model, correspond to slowly
moving pointers. Next, we emphasize that the nice feature of Bohmian mechanics,
which doesn't distinguish microscopic and macroscopic systems, implies that the
quantum weirdness of quantum physics also shows up at the macro-scale. Finally,
we discuss the fact that Bohmian mechanics is attractive to philosophers, but
not so much to physicists and argue that the Bohmian community is responsible
for the latter.

promises security based on the laws of physics and has rapidly grown from

systems. Despite these advances, QKD has not been widely adopted, and practical
large-scale deployment will likely require integrated chip-based devices for
improved performance, miniaturisation and enhanced functionality, fully

reconfigurability of these devices to demonstrate three important QKD protocols
--- BB84, Coherent One Way (COW) and Differential Phase Shift (DPS) --- with
performance comparable to state-of-the-art. These devices, when combined with
integrated single photon detectors, satisfy the requirements at each of the

their operation, many of these components produce large amounts of data in the
form of event and error logs that are essential not only for identifying and
resolving problems but also for improving data center efficiency and
management. Most of these activities would benefit significantly from data
analytics techniques to exploit hidden statistical patterns and correlations
that may be present in the data. The sheer volume of data to be analyzed makes
uncovering these correlations and patterns a challenging task. This paper
presents BiDAl, a prototype Java tool for log-data analysis that incorporates
several Big Data technologies in order to simplify the task of extracting
information from data traces produced by large clusters and server farms. BiDAl
provides the user with several analysis languages (SQL, R and Hadoop MapReduce)
and storage backends (HDFS and SQLite) that can be freely mixed and matched so
that a custom tool for a specific task can be easily constructed. BiDAl has a
modular architecture so that it can be extended with other backends and
analysis languages in the future. In this paper we present the design of BiDAl
and describe our experience using it to analyze publicly-available traces from
Google data clusters, with the goal of building a realistic model of a complex
data center.

supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory on a three-sphere are unstable with
respect to fluctuations breaking the global $SO(6)$ R-symmetry. Using the gauge
theory/gravity correspondence, a large class of initial conditions in the
R-symmetry singlet sector of the theory was been identified that fail to
thermalize \cite{Buchel:2013uba,Balasubramanian:2014cja}. A toy model
realization of such states is provided by {\it boson stars}, a stationary
gravitational configurations supported by a complex scalar field in
$AdS_5$-gravity. Motivated by the SYM example, we extend the boson star toy
model to include the global $SO(6)$ R-symmetry. We show that sufficient light
boson stars in the R-symmetry singlet sector are stable with respect to
linearized fluctuations. As the mass of the boson star increases, they do
suffer tachyonic instability associated with their localization on $S^5$. This
is opposite to the behaviour of small black holes (dual to equilibrium states
of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM) in global $AdS_5$: the latter develop tachyonic
instability as they become sufficiently light. Based on analogy with light
boson stars, we expect that the R-symmetry singlet nonthermal states in
strongly coupled gauge theories, represented by the quasiperiodic solutions of
\cite{Balasubramanian:2014cja}, are stable with respect to linearized
fluctuations breaking the R-symmetry.

harvests energy from the received radio-frequency signals, which include the

The harvested energy is then used to decode the secondary information and

  (ICRC2015), The Hague, The Netherlands; 8 pages",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The H.E.S.S. experiment entered its phase II with the addition of a new,
large telescope named CT 5 that was added to the centre of the existing array
of four smaller telescopes. The new telescope is able to detect fainter air
showers due to its larger mirror area, thereby lowering the energy threshold of
the array from a few hundred GeV down to $\mathcal{O}(50\,\textrm{GeV})$. Due
to the power-law decrease of typical {\gamma}-ray and cosmic-ray spectra of
astrophysical sources a majority of detected air showers are of low energies,
thus being detected by CT 5 only, which motivates the need for a reconstruction
algorithm based on information from CT 5 alone. By exploiting such monoscopic
events the H.E.S.S. experiment in phase II becomes sensitive in an energy range
not covered by H.E.S.S. I and in which the Fermi LAT runs out of statistics.
Furthermore the chance of detecting transient phenomena like {\gamma}-ray
bursts is increased significantly due to the large effective area of CT 5 at
low energies.
  In this contribution a newly developed reconstruction algorithm for
monoscopic events based on neural networks is presented. This algorithm uses
multilayer perceptrons to reconstruct the direction and energy of the particle
initiating the air shower and also to discriminate between gamma rays and
hadrons. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated and compared to other
existing reconstruction algorithms. Furthermore results of first applications
of the algorithm to measured data are shown.

predicted given early data on transmission. Despite the commonality of this
phenomena, there are no known general mechanisms able to cause an exponentially
spreading dis- ease to begin spreading faster. Indeed most features of real
world social networks, e.g. clustering1,2 and community structure3, and of
human behaviour, e.g. social distancing4 and increased hygiene5, will slow
disease spread. Here, we consider a model where individuals with essential
societal roles-e.g. teachers, first responders, health-care workers, etc.- who
fall ill are replaced with healthy individuals. We refer to this process as
relational exchange. Relational exchange is also a behavioural process, but one
whose effect on disease transmission is less obvious. By incorporating this
behaviour into a dynamic network model, we demonstrate that replacing
individuals can accelerate disease transmission. Furthermore, we find that the
effects of this process are trivial when considering a standard mass-action
model, but dramatic when considering network structure. This result highlights
another critical shortcoming in mass-action models, namely their inability to
account for behavioural processes. Lastly, using empirical data, we find that
this mechanism parsimoniously explains observed patterns across more than
seventeen years of influenza and dengue virus data. We anticipate that our
findings will advance the emerging field of disease forecasting and will better
inform public health decision making during outbreaks.

geometry of the chloroplasts. Our model exhibits a linear trend, with linearly
growing scatter dependent on chloroplast shape, consistent with the data. When
modelled chloroplasts are of a shape that grows with a constant area to volume
ratio (disks, cylinders) we find a linear trend with minimal scatter.
Chloroplasts with area and volume that do not grow proportionally (spheres)
exhibit a linear trend with additional scatter.

a statistically complete sample in the LMC regions of interest here. The
resulting cluster frequencies suggest that the outermost regions of the LMC bar
first experienced enhanced cluster formation -- $\log(t$ yr$^{-1}) \in

from the conventional dilute limit. Here we report experimental evidence for

distinct exotic glassy state, which we call a ""spin jam"", for high magnetic
concentration region (p>0.8) and a cluster spin glass for lower magnetic
concentration, (p<0.8). This observation indicates that a spin jam is a unique

in three different scenarios, depending on the availability of perfect channel
side information (CSI) of the transmission and interference links, statistical
CSI of both links, or perfect CSI of the transmission link and imperfect CSI of
the interference link. The impact of imperfect channel sensing decisions on the
error rate performance of cognitive transmissions is also evaluated. In
addition, tradeoffs between the number of retransmissions, the severity of
fading, and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) quality are analyzed numerically.
Moreover, performance comparisons of multimedia transmission with conventional
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and HQAM, and the proposed power control
strategies are carried out in terms of the received data quality and number of
retransmissions.

goal, we study the simplest kind of spherically-symmetric matter: an
infinitely-thin shell of dust. Our system can be understood as a model of a
star accreting a thin layer of matter. We solve the dynamics of the shell
exactly and find that, indeed, as it collapses, the shell leaves in its wake
the wormhole metric. In the maximal-slicing time we use for asymptotically flat
solutions, the shell only approaches the throat asymptotically and does not
cross it in a finite amount of time (as measured by a clock `at infinity').
This leaves open the possibility that a more realistic cosmological solution of
Shape Dynamics might see this crossing happening in a finite amount of time (as
measured by the change of relational/shape degrees of freedom).

spectrum can be fitted with a thermal disk with an apparent inner disk
temperature of 0.17 keV and a rest-frame 0.24-11.8 keV unabsorbed luminosity of
~5e43 erg/s, subject to a fast-moving warm absorber. Short-term variability was
also clearly observed, with the spectrum being softer at lower flux. The source
was covered but not detected in a Chandra observation on 2000 April 3, a Swift
observation on 2005 September 10, and a second XMM-Newton observation on 2014

spectrum of the candidate host galaxy, taken ~11 yrs after the XMM-Newton

and ultrasoft properties, leads us to explain the source as tidal disruption of
a star by the supermassive black hole in the galactic center. We attribute the
fast-moving warm absorber detected in the first XMM-Newton observation to the

evolution of galaxy sizes, baryon fractions, morphologies and angular momenta

fiducial model with a high local star formation efficiency, which results in
efficient feedback, produces a realistic late-type galaxy that matches the
evolution of basic properties of late-type galaxies: stellar mass, disk size,
morphology dominated by a kinematically cold disk, stellar and gas surface
density profiles, and specific angular momentum. We argue that feedback's role
in this success is twofold: (1) removal of low-angular momentum gas and (2)
maintaining a low disk-to-halo mass fraction which suppresses disk
instabilities that lead to angular momentum redistribution and a central
concentration of baryons. However, our model with a low local star formation
efficiency, but large energy input per supernova, chosen to produce a galaxy
with a similar star formation history as our fiducial model, leads to a highly
irregular galaxy with no kinematically cold component, overly extended stellar
distribution and low angular momentum. This indicates that only when feedback
is allowed to become vigorous via locally efficient star formation in dense
cold gas, resulting galaxy sizes, gas/stellar surface density profiles and
stellar disk angular momenta agree with observed $z=0$ galaxies.

unchanged. Here we present possible star formation scenarios which can explain
its unique metallicity distribution. While the majority of stars in all other
ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) are within 0.5 dex of the mean [Fe/H] for the galaxy,
5 of the 7 stars in Segue 1 have a spread of $\Delta$[Fe/H] $>0.8$ dex. We show
that this distribution of metallicities canot be explained by a gradual
build-up of stars, but instead requires clustered star formation. Chemical
tagging allows the separate unresolved delta functions in abundance space to be
associated with discrete events in space and time. This provides an opportunity
to put the enrichment events into a time sequence and unravel the history of
the system. We investigate two possible scenarios for the star formation
history of Segue 1 using Fyris Alpha simulations of gas in a $10^7$ M$_\odot$
dark matter halo. The lack of stars with intermediate metallicities $-3<$
[Fe/H] $<-2$ can be explained either by a pause in star formation caused by
supernova feedback, or by the spread of metallicities resulting from one or two
supernovae in a low-mass dark matter halo. Either possibility can reproduce the
metallicity distribution function (MDF), as well as the other observed
elemental abundances. The unusual MDF and the low luminosity of Segue 1 can be
explained by it being a first galaxy that originated with
$M_{\rm{vir}}\sim10^7$~M$_\odot$ at $z\sim10$.

on the line profiles of core-collapse supernovae in order to determine the
masses of newly formed dust. As noted by Lucy et al. (1989), the presence of an
extended red scattering wing in late-time line profiles can also indicate dust
formation. We find that dust-affected line profiles need not necessarily be
flux-biased towards to the blue, although the profile peak will always be
blue-shifted. We have collated optical spectra of SN 1987A from a variety of
archival sources and have modelled the evolution of the H$\alpha$ line from
days 714 to 3604, as well as that of the [OI] 6300,6363A doublet between days
714 and 1478. A variety of evidence points to the presence of clumping and we
find that our clumped dust models require significantly higher dust masses than
smoothly distributed dust models. Our line profile fits imply day 714 dust
masses of <3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ for all grain types apart from very
high albedo pure magnesium silicates, for which up to 0.07M$_{\odot}$ can be
accommodated. Large grain radii (>0.6$\mu$m) are generally required to fit the
line profiles even at the earlier epochs. We find that a large dust mass
(>0.1M$_{\odot}$) had formed by day 3604 and infer that the majority of the
present dust mass must have formed after this epoch. Our findings agree with
recent estimates from SED fits for the dust mass evolution of SN 1987A and

diagrams that appear as a result of cloud-cloud collisions. Broad bridges will
have a finite lifetime due to the action of feedback, conversion of gas into
stars and the timescale of the collision. We make a series of analytic
arguments with which to estimate these lifetimes. Our simple analytic arguments
suggest that for collisions between clouds larger than R~10 pc the lifetime of
the broad bridge is more likely to be determined by the lifetime of the
collision rather than the radiative or wind feedback disruption timescale.
However for smaller clouds feedback becomes much more effective. This is
because the radiative feedback timescale scales with the ionising flux Nly as
R^{7/4}Nly^{-1/4} so a reduction in cloud size requires a relatively large
decrease in ionising photons to maintain a given timescale. We find that our
analytic arguments are consistent with new synthetic observations of numerical
simulations of cloud-cloud collisions (including star formation and radiative
feedback). We also argue that if the number of observable broad bridges remains
~ constant, then the disruption timescale must be roughly equivalent to the
collision rate. If this is the case our analytic arguments also provide
collision rate estimates, which we find are readily consistent with previous
theoretical models at the scales they consider (clouds larger than about 10 pc)
but are much higher for smaller clouds.

weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which froze out of thermal

could be detected by exploiting their predicted coupling to two photons, where
the highest sensitivity is reached by experiments using a microwave cavity

scatters off atomic nuclei in underground, ultra low-background detectors, or
indirectly, via secondary radiation produced when they pair annihilate. They
could also be generated at particle colliders such as the LHC, where associated

implications for particle nature of DM. In order to reconcile such
astrophysical observations for self interaction with particle properties for
DM, we consider the general scenario of self interacting Dirac fermionic DM,
$\chi$. Also since the exact particle physics model for DM is yet to be probed,
we simply adopt the effective model independent framework for DM self
interaction which occurs via the most general effective 4-fermion operators
invariant under both Lorentz and CPT transformations. From the thorough
investigation of the interrelations among the parameters in this framework,
namely, the effective DM self couplings ($G_{i}$), DM mass ($m_{\chi}$) and
relative velocity ($v_{\rm rel}$), it can be inferred that $G_{i}$ decrease
with increasing $m_{\chi}$ for a given DM self interaction strength. Moreover,
for few types of effective operators the values of $G_{i}$ fall off with
increasing $v_{\rm rel}$ while they remain roughly constant for a wide range of
$v_{\rm rel}$ for other cases. In addition, the parameter space in this
framework is constrained by the claimed observational results of ${\sigma \over
m_{\chi}}$ on cluster scales (Abell 3827, Bullet Cluster) after averaging the
DM self interaction cross sections over DM velocity distribution in the
cluster. This puts interesting constraints on the values of effective DM self
couplings for different fermionic DM masses for various effective operators

implications of DM effective self interaction are also discussed in this model

remnant in 5 energy bands using an archival 750 ks Chandra observation. Rims
narrow with increasing energy and are well described by either loss-limited or
damped scenarios, so X-ray rim width-energy dependence does not uniquely
specify a model. But, radio counterparts to thin rims are not loss-limited and
better reflect magnetic field structure. Joint radio and X-ray modeling favors
magnetic damping in Tycho's SNR with damping lengths ~1--5% of remnant radius
and magnetic field strengths ~50--400 $\mu$G assuming Bohm diffusion. X-ray rim
widths are ~1% of remnant radius, somewhat smaller than inferred damping
lengths. Electron energy losses are important in all models of X-ray rims,
suggesting that the distinction between loss-limited and damped models is
blurred in soft X-rays. All loss-limited and damping models require magnetic
fields $\gtrsim$ 20 $\mu$G, affirming the necessity of magnetic field
amplification beyond simple compression.

or mildly-relativistic) shock wave expanding outwards into the surrounding
medium. The medium itself is likely modified due to the stellar mass-loss from
the massive star progenitor, which may be Wolf-Rayet stars (for Type Ib/c SNe),
red supergiant stars (for type IIP and perhaps IIb and IIL SNe), or some other
stellar type. The wind mass-loss parameters determine the density structure of
the surrounding medium. Combined with the velocity of the SN shock wave, this
regulates the shock acceleration process. In this article we discuss the
essential parameters that control the particle acceleration and gamma-ray
emission in SNe, with particular reference to the Type IIb SN 1993J. The shock
wave expanding into the high density medium leads to fast particle
acceleration, giving rise to rapidly-growing plasma instabilities driven by the
acceleration process itself. The instabilities grow over intraday timescales.
This growth, combined with the interplay of non-linear processes, results in
the amplification of the magnetic field at the shock front, which can
adequately account for the magnetic field strengths deduced from radio
monitoring of the source. The maximum particle energy can reach, and perhaps
exceed, 1 PeV, depending on the dominant instability. The gamma-ray signal is
found to be heavily absorbed by pair production process during the first week
after the outburst. We derive the time dependent particle spectra and
associated hadronic signatures of secondary particles (gamma-ray, leptons and
neutrinos) arising from proton proton interactions. We find that the Cherenkov
Telescope Array (CTA) should be able to detect objects like SN 1993J above 1
TeV. We predict a low neutrino flux above 10 TeV, implying a detectability
horizon with current or planned neutrino telescopes of 1 Mpc.

  Scaling","CMU PhD Thesis",,,,"cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For the past four decades, cost and features have driven CMOS scaling. Severe
lithography and material limitations seen below the 20 nm node, however, are
challenging the fundamental premise of affordable CMOS scaling. Just continuing
to co-optimize leaf cell circuit and layout designs with process technology
does not enable us to exploit the challenges of a sub-20 nm CMOS. For
affordable scaling it is imperative to work past sub-20 nm technology
impediments while exploiting its features. To this end, we propose to broaden
the scope of design technology co-optimization (DTCO) to be more holistic by
including micro-architecture design and CAD, along with circuits, layout and
process technology. Applying such holistic DTCO to the most significant block
in a system-on-chip (SoC), embedded memory, we can synthesize smarter and
efficient embedded memory blocks that are customized to application needs.
  To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed holistic DTCO process, we designed,
fabricated and tested several design experiments in a state-of-the-art IBM
14SOI process. DTCOed leaf cells, standard cells and SRAM bitcells were robust
during testing, but failed to meet node to node area scaling requirements.
Holistic DTCO, when applied to a widely used parallel access SRAM sub-block,
consumed 25% less area with a 50% better performance per watt compared to a
traditional implementation using compiled SRAM blocks and standard cells. To
extend the benefits of holistic DTCO to other embedded memory intensive
sub-blocks in SoCs, we developed a readily customizable smart memory synthesis
framework (SMSF). We believe that such an approach is important to establish an
affordable path for sub-20 nm scaling.

However, no comprehensive or satisfactory explanation has been put forth to

the distribution of their sources and of the effects of geometry and properties
of the magnetic field through which particles propagate. It is generally
believed that the anisotropy topology at the largest angular scale is
adiabatically shaped by diffusion in the structured interstellar magnetic
field. On the contrary, the medium- and small-scale angular structure could be
an effect of non-diffusive propagation of cosmic rays in perturbed magnetic
fields. In particular, a possible explanation of the observed small-scale
anisotropy observed at TeV energy scale, may come from the effect of particle
scattering in turbulent magnetized plasmas. We perform numerical integration of
test particle trajectories in low-$\beta$ compressible magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence to study how the cosmic rays arrival direction distribution is
perturbed when they stream along the local turbulent magnetic field. We utilize
Liouville's theorem for obtaining the anisotropy at Earth and provide the

biochemical systems. Rules enable a precise encoding of biochemical
interactions at the resolution of sites within molecules, but obtaining an
integrated global view from sets of rules remains challenging. Current
automated approaches to rule visualization fail to address the complexity of
interactions between rules, limiting either the types of rules that are allowed
or the set of interactions that can be visualized simultaneously. There is a
need for scalable visualization approaches that present the information encoded
in rules in an intuitive and useful manner at different levels of detail. We
have developed new automated approaches for visualizing both individual rules
and complete rule-based models. We find that a more compact representation of
an individual rule promotes promotes understanding the model assumptions
underlying each rule. For global visualization of rule interactions, we have
developed a method to synthesize a network of interactions between sites and
processes from a rule-based model and then use a combination of user-defined
and automated approaches to compress this network into a readable form. The
resulting diagrams enable modelers to identify signaling motifs such as
cascades, feedback loops, and feed-forward loops in complex models, as we
demonstrate using several large-scale models. These capabilities are
implemented within the BioNetGen framework but the approach is equally
applicable to rule-based models specified in other formats.

process. Taking into account the dependence structure does not allow us to use
the approach of the independent case. Especially, the dynamic programming
algorithm giving the optimal solution in the independent case cannot be used
anymore. We propose a two-step method, based on the preliminary robust (to the
change-points) estimation of the autoregression parameters. Then, we propose to
follow the classical approach, by plugging this estimator in the criterion used
for change-point estimation, which is equivalent to decorrelate the series
using the estimated autoregression parameters. We show that the asymptotic
properties of these change-point location and mean estimators are the same as
those of the classical estimators in the independent framework. The same
plug-in approach is then used to approximate the modified BIC and choose the
number of segments, and to derive a heuristic BIC criterion to select both the
number of changes and the order of the autoregression. Finally, we show, in the
simulation section, that for finite sample size taking into account the
dependence structure improves the statistical performance of the change-point
estimators and of the selection criterion.

effective and scalable solution to large scale spatial data processing and
analytics. MapReduce based systems achieve massive scalability by partitioning
the data and running query tasks on those partitions in parallel. Therefore,
effective data partitioning is critical for task parallelization, load
balancing, and directly affects system performance. However, several pitfalls
of spatial data partitioning make this task particularly challenging. First,
data skew is very common in spatial applications. To achieve best query
performance, data skew need to be reduced. Second, spatial partitioning
approaches generate boundary objects that cross multiple partitions, and add
extra query processing overhead. Consequently, boundary objects need to be
minimized. Third, the high computational complexity of spatial partitioning
algorithms combined with massive amounts of data require an efficient approach
for partitioning to achieve overall fast query response. In this paper, we
provide a systematic evaluation of multiple spatial partitioning methods with a
set of different partitioning strategies, and study their implications on the

typically assumes that the flux field is either a spatially correlated Gaussian

fixed using flux inventories (e.g., NAEI or EDGAR in Europe). Here, we extend
this approach in three ways. First, we develop a bivariate model for the

significant computational savings over the univariate approach. Second, we
employ a lognormal spatial process for the flux field that captures both the

Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is presented. A
time sequence of 131 A images reveals that a C-class flare occurred at one
footpoint of a large loop and triggered an intensity disturbance (enhancement)
propagating along it. The spatial features and temporal evolution suggest that
a fundamental standing slow-mode wave could be set up quickly after meeting of
two initial disturbances from the opposite footpoints. The oscillations have a
period of ~12 min and a decay time of ~9 min. The measured phase speed of
500$\pm$50 km/s matches the sound speed in the heated loop of ~10 MK,
confirming that the observed waves are of slow mode. We derive the
time-dependent temperature and electron density wave signals from six AIA
extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) channels, and find that they are nearly in phase.The
measured polytropic index from the temperature and density perturbations is
1.64$\pm$0.08 close to the adiabatic index of 5/3 for an ideal monatomic gas.
The interpretation based on a 1D linear MHD model suggests that the thermal
conductivity is suppressed by at least a factor of 3 in the hot flare loop at 9
MK and above. The viscosity coefficient is determined by coronal seismology
from the observed wave when only considering the compressive viscosity
dissipation. We find that to interpret the rapid wave damping, the classical
compressive viscosity coefficient needs to be enhanced by a factor of 15 as the
upper limit.

with limited aggregations. The latter is a model of coagulation introduced by
Bertoin which may exhibit gelation.
  In our model, a large number of particles are initially given a prescribed
number of arms. These arms are activated independently after exponential times
and successively linked together. However, when the size of a cluster goes
above a fixed threshold, it falls instantaneously into the gel, meaning that it
no longer interacts with the other particles in solution.
  The concentrations in this model asymptotically obey Smoluchowski's equation
with limited aggregations. In this article, we study the discrete features of
this model. We are able to argue that it remains closely related with a
configuration model. We specifically obtain explicit expressions for the
parameters of this configuration model, which show that it is subcritical
before gelation, but remains critical afterwards. As a consequence, the
asymptotic distribution of a typical cluster in solution is that of a
subcritical Galton-Watson tree before gelation, while it is that of a critical
Galton-Watson tree after gelation. Our model therefore exhibits self-organized
criticality.
  Our study relies heavily on the study of the configuration model in the
critical window. One of the main results of the paper is an extension of a
result of Janson and Luczak on the size of the largest components in this
critical window.
  Finally, as a consequence of our explicit expressions, we provide an
explanation of analytic formulas established by Normand and Zambotti regarding
the limiting concentrations in Smoluchowski's equation.

leading to an axion Jeans scale which is cosmologically negligible for a
canonical axion mass. Our classically derived axion pressure term in Einstein's
gravity is identical to the one derived in the non-relativistic quantum
mechanical context in the literature. We show that except for the axion
pressure term, the axion fluid equations are exactly the same as the general
relativistic continuity and Euler equations of a zero-pressure fluid up to
third order perturbation. The general relativistic density and velocity
perturbations of the CDM in the CDM-comoving gauge are exactly the same as the
Newtonian perturbations to the second order (in all scales), and the pure
general relativistic corrections appearing from the third order are numerically
negligible (in all scales as well) in the current paradigm of concordance
cosmology. Therefore, here we prove that, in the super-Jeans scale, the
classical axion can be handled as the Newtonian CDM fluid up to third order
perturbation. We also show that the axion fluid supports the vector-type

closed surface. A covering between hypermaps is a homomorphism between the
embedded hypergraphs which extends to an orientation-preserving covering of the
supporting surfaces. A covering of a hypermap onto itself is an automorphism,
and a hypermap is regular if its automorphism group acts transitively on the
brins. Depending on the algebraic theory of regular hypermaps and hypermap
operations, the abelian regular coverings over the quaternion hypermap are
investigated. We define normalized multicyclic coverings between regular
hypermaps, generalizing almost totally branched coverings studied in [K. Hu, R.

superconductor. The superconducting parameters like critical temperature (Tc),
upper critical field (Hc2) and normalized specific-heat jump are reported for
Ni doped Pd1-xNixTe. The samples of series Pd1-xNixTe with nominal compositions
x=0, .01, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3 and 1.0 are synthesized via solid
state reaction route. All the studied samples of series Pd1-xNixTe (x = 0.0 to
1.0) are crystallized in hexagonal crystal structure within the space group
P63/mmc. Unit cell volume shrinks almost linearly upon Ni doping in Pd1-xNixTe.
The normal state residual resistivity increases with Ni substitution on Pd
site. Both the electrical resistivity and magnetic measurements revealed that
Tc decreases with increase of Ni concentration in Pd1-xNixTe and is not
observed down to 2K for x=0.30 i.e., 30% of Ni doping at Pd site.
Interestingly, this is unusual for magnetic Ni doping in a known type-II BCS
type superconductor. Magnetic Ni must suppress the superconductivity much
faster. Interestingly, the isothermal magnetization measurements for NiTe
revealed that Ni is non-magnetic in Pd1-xNixTe structure and hence the Tc
depression is mainly due to disorder. The magneto-transport measurements
revealed that flux is better pinned for 20% Ni doped PdTe as compared to other
compositions of Pd1-xNixTe. The magnetic field dependence of specific heat of
Pd1-xNixTe for x=0.01 was studied and the estimated value of the normalized
specific-heat jump,is found to be 1.42, which is under BCS weak-coupling limit.
Summarily, we report the impact of Ni doping in Pd1-xNixTe superconductor and
conclude that Ni substitutes at Pd site, suppress superconductivity moderately
and is of non magnetic nature in this system. To best of our knowledge this is
the first study on Ni substitution in PdTe superconductor.

several advantages when cost, integration of capabilities, or large search
areas need to be considered. A heterogeneous team allows for the robots to
become ""specialized"", accomplish sub-goals more effectively, and thus increase
the overall mission efficiency. Two main scenarios are considered in this work.
In the first case study we exploit mobility to implement a power control
algorithm that increases the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR)
among certain members of the network. We create realistic sensing fields and
manipulation by using the geometric properties of the sensor field-of-view and
the manipulability metric, respectively. The control strategy for each agent of
the heterogeneous system is governed by an artificial physics law that
considers the different kinematics of the agents and the environment, in a
decentralized fashion. Through simulation results we show that the network is
able to stay connected at all times and covers the environment well. The second
scenario studied in this paper is the biologically-inspired coordination of
heterogeneous physical robotic systems. A team of ground rovers, designed to
emulate desert seed-harvester ants, explore an experimental area using
behaviors fine-tuned in simulation by a genetic algorithm. Our robots
coordinate with a base station and collect clusters of resources scattered
within the experimental space. We demonstrate experimentally that through
coordination with an aerial vehicle, our ant-like ground robots are able to
collect resources two times faster than without the use of heterogeneous

locate the finite volume transition point $T_{0}(V)$ of the QCD deconfinement
phase transition to a Colorless QGP, we have developed a new approach using the
finite size cumulant expansion of the order parameter and the $L_{mn}$-method.
The first six cumulants $C_{1,2,3,4,5,6}$ with the corresponding
under-normalized ratios(skewness $\Sigma$, kurtosis $\kappa$ ,pentosis

unifying in a clear and consistent way the definitions of cumulant ratios, is
proposed. A numerical FSS analysis of the obtained results has allowed us to
locate accurately the finite volume transition point. The extracted transition
temperature value $T_{0}(V)$ agrees with that expected $T_{0}^{N}(V)$ from the
order parameter and the thermal susceptibility $\chi _{T}\left( T,V\right)$,
according to the standard procedure of localization to within about $2\%$. In

essential for planning sustainable urban systems. Recently, it was shown that
income and wealth creation follow increasing returns, scaling superlinearly
with city size. We study scaling of per capita incomes for separate census
defined income categories against population size for the whole of Australia.
Across several urban area definitions, we find that lowest incomes grow just
linearly or sublinearly ($\beta = 0.94$ to $1.00$), whereas highest incomes
grow superlinearly ($\beta = 1.00$ to $1.21$), with total income just
superlinear ($\beta = 1.03$ to $1.05$). These findings support the earlier
finding: the bigger the city, the richer the city. But, we also see an emergent
metric of inequality: the larger the population size and densities of a city,
higher incomes grow more quickly than lower, suggesting a disproportionate
agglomeration of incomes in the highest income categories in big cities.
Because there are many more people on lower incomes that scale sublinearly as
compared to the highest that scale superlinearly, these findings suggest a
scaling of inequality: the larger the population, the greater the inequality.
Urban and economic planning will need to examine ways in which larger cities
can be made more equitable.

operator only one is physically relevant for the limit density of the Wigner

density of the Wigner walk acquires a much simpler form. This allows us to
identify various dynamical regimes which are otherwise hidden in the standard
basis description. As an example, we show that it is possible to find an
initial state which reduces the number of peaks in the probability distribution
from generic $2j+1$ to a single one. Moreover, the models with integer $j$ lead
to the trapping effect. The derived formula for the trapping probability

occur in the 90{\deg} ply which then develop into a saturated state where the
ply cannot support additional load. The dependence of the micro-structure of

very little when optimized for different states belonging to the 4f electronic
configuration, (ii) due to strong spin-orbit coupling the total spin is not a

calculation that the CASSCF/SI-SO method can be simplified to a single

diagonalization, including spin-orbit coupling, on determinant basis. Besides
its conceptual simplicity, this approach has the advantage that all spin states

thereby overcoming one of the computational limitations of the existing

framework, based on stochastic geometry, to study FD communications in cellular
networks. Particularly, we assess the FD communications effect on the network
performance and quantify the associated gains. The study proves the
vulnerability of the uplink to the downlink interference and shows that the
improved FD rate gains harvested in the downlink (up to $97\%$) comes at the
expense of a significant degradation in the uplink rate (up to $94\%$).
Therefore, we propose a novel fine-grained duplexing scheme, denoted as
$\alpha$-duplex scheme, which allows a partial overlap between the uplink and
the downlink frequency bands. We derive the required conditions to harvest rate
gains from the $\alpha$-duplex scheme and show its superiority to both the FD

scheme provides a simultaneous improvement of $28\%$ for the downlink rate and
$56\%$ for the uplink rate. Finally, we show that the amount of the overlap can

algorithm. This paper shows the comparison of Secure Force 64, 128, and 192 bit

optical properties of the galaxies in the Ophiuchus cluster, in particular with
the aim of understanding better its dynamical properties. We have obtained deep
optical imaging in several bands with various telescopes, and applied a
sophisticated method to model and subtract the contributions of stars in order
to measure galaxy magnitudes as accurately as possible. The colour-magnitude
relations obtained show that there are hardly any blue galaxies in Ophiuchus
(at least brighter than r'<=19.5), and this is confirmed by the fact that we
only detect two galaxies in Halpha. We also obtained a number of spectra with
ESO-FORS2, that we combined with previously available redshifts. Altogether, we
have 152 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the 0.02<=z<=0.04 range, and
89 galaxies with both a redshift within the cluster redshift range and a
measured r' band magnitude (limited to the Megacam 1x1 deg^2 field). A complete
dynamical analysis based on the galaxy redshifts available shows that the
overall cluster is relaxed and has a mass of 1.1x10^15 solar masses. The
Sernal-Gerbal method detects a main structure and a much smaller substructure
that are not separated in projection. From its dynamical properties derived
from optical data, the Ophiuchus cluster seems to be overall a relaxed
structure, or at most a minor merger, though in X-rays the central region

with this, the photon phase space is discussed in more detail since in the case
of the polarized $\tau$ lepton it is not trivial. The decay matrix element
contains both the inner bremsstrahlung and the resonance (structural)

calculated. They are the asymmetry of the differential decay width caused by
the $\tau$ lepton polarization, the Stokes parameters of the emitted photon
itself and the correlation parameters describing the influence of $\tau$-lepton
polarization on the photon Stokes parameters. The numerical estimation was done
in the $\tau$ lepton rest frame for arbitrary direction of the $\tau$ lepton
polarization 3-vector. The vector and axial-vector form factors describing the
structure-dependent part of the decay amplitude are determined using the chiral
effective theory with resonances (R$\chi$T). It was found that the features of
the azimuthal distributions allows to separate various terms in the
spin-dependent contribution. The so-called up-down and right-left asymmetries

explains the problem of causal inference in cue combination successfully, how
causal inference in cue combination could be implemented by neural circuits, is
unclear. The existing method based on calculating log posterior ratio with
variable elimination has the problem of being unrealistic and task-specific. In
this paper, we take advantages of the special structure of the Bayesian causal
inference model and propose a hierarchical inference algorithm based on
importance sampling. A simple neural circuit is designed to implement the
proposed inference algorithm. Theoretical analyses and experimental results
demonstrate that our algorithm converges to the accurate value as the sample

generalized to implement inference for other problems, such as the
multi-stimuli cause inference and the same-different judgment.

classify various drift motions and find their limits of applicability; (iv) to

Our approach to study a drift is rather unusual: instead of solving the ODE for
trajectories we consider a hyperbolic PDE for a scalar lagrangian field
$a(\vx,t)$, trajectories represent the characteristics curves for this PDE. It
leads us to purely eulerian description of lagrangian motion, that greatly
simplifies the calculations. There are two small scaling parameters in the
problem: a ratio of two time-scales and a dimensionless vibrational amplitude.
It leads us to the sequence of problems for distinguished limits. We have
considered four distinguished limits which differ from each other by the scale
of slow time. We have shown that each distinguished limit produces an infinite
number of solutions for $a(\vx,t)$. A classical drift appears in the case of a
purely oscillating flow. At the same time, we have shown that the concept of
drift motion is not sufficient for the description of lagrangian dynamics and
some `diffusion' terms do appear. Five examples of different options of drifts

flows of low-speed rarefied gases are in high demand, due to the increasing
ability to manufacture devices at micro and nano scales. One such model and
method is a Fokker-Planck approximation to the Boltzmann equation, which can be
solved numerically by a stochastic particle method. The stochastic nature of
this method leads to noisy estimates of the thermodynamic quantities one wishes
to sample when the signal is small in comparison to the thermal velocity of the
gas. Recently, Gorji et al have proposed a method which is able to greatly
reduce the variance of the estimators, by creating a correlated stochastic
process which acts as a control variate for the noisy estimates. However, there
are potential difficulties involved when the geometry of the problem is
complex, as the method requires the density to be solved for independently.
  Importance sampling is a variance reduction technique that has already been
shown to successfully reduce the noise in direct simulation Monte Carlo
calculations. In this paper we propose an importance sampling method for the
Fokker-Planck stochastic particle scheme. The method requires minimal change to
the original algorithm, and dramatically reduces the variance of the estimates.
We test the importance sampling scheme on a homogeneous relaxation, planar
Couette flow and a lid-driven-cavity flow, and find that our method is able to
greatly reduce the noise of estimated quantities. Significantly, we find that
as the characteristic speed of the flow decreases, the variance of the noisy
estimators becomes independent of the characteristic speed.

simple opto-acoustic coupling that includes both photoelastic/electrostrictive
and radiation pressure/moving boundary effects. The Heisenberg equations of
motion are used to obtain coupled mode equations for quantized envelope
operators for the optical and acoustic fields. We show that the coupling
coefficients obtained coincide with those established earlier, but our
formalism provides a much simpler demonstration of the connection between
radiation pressure and moving boundary effects than in previous work [C. Wolff
et al, Physical Review A 92, 013836 (2015)].

dynamics of screw dislocations is investigated by means of a generalised
minimising-movements scheme approach. The assumption of a finite number of
available glide directions, together with the ""maximal dissipation criterion""
that governs the equations of motion, results into solving a differential
inclusion rather than an ODE. This paper addresses how the model in [CG99] is
connected to a time-discrete evolution scheme which explicitly confines
dislocations to move each time step along a single glide direction. It is
proved that the time-continuous model in [CG99] is the limit of these
time-discrete minimising-movement schemes when the time step converges to 0.
The study presented here is a first step towards a generalisation of the
setting in [AGS08, Chap. 2 and 3] that allows for dissipations which cannot be

this study, we assess the biocompatibility and functionality of multifunctional
MSN in freshly isolated, primary murine immune cells. We show that the
functionalized silica nanoparticles are rapidly and efficiently taken up into
the endosomal compartment by specialized antigen-presenting cells such as
dendritic cells. The silica nanoparticles showed a favorable toxicity profile
and did not affect the viability of primary immune cells from the spleen in
relevant concentrations. Cargo-free MSN induced only very low immune responses
in primary cells as determined by surface expression of activation markers and
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6, -12 and -1\beta.
In contrast, when surface-functionalized MSN with a pH-responsive polymer
capping were loaded with an immune-activating drug, the synthetic Toll-like
receptor 7 agonist R848, a strong immune response was provoked. We thus
demonstrate that MSN represent an efficient drug delivery vehicle to primary
immune cells that is both non-toxic and non-inflammagenic, which is a
prerequisite for the use of these particles in biomedical applications.

aggregate economic models with limit cycles and equilibriums, subject them to
chaotic exogenous shocks and obtain chaotic cyclical motions. Thus, we
emphasize that chaotic cycles, which are inevitable in economics, are not only
interior properties of economic models, but also can be considered as a result
of interaction of several economical systems. This provides a comprehension of
chaos (unpredictability, lack of forecasting) and control of chaos as a global
economic phenomenon from the deterministic point of view.
  We suppose that the results of our paper are contribution to the mixed
exogenous-endogenous theories of business cycles in classification by P.A.
Samuelson [76]. Moreover, they demonstrate that the irregularity of the
extended chaos can be structured, and this distinguishes them from the
generalized synchronization. The advantage of the knowledge of the structure is
that by applying instruments, which already have been developed for

mechanisms such that entrainment by chaos, attraction of chaotic cycles by

GaN(000-1) surface where both types of atoms: nitrogen and gallium attach the
surface and diffuse independently, explains that at relatively high rates of
the step flow (miscut angle <2deg) the low diffusion of gallium adatoms causes
surface instabilities and leads to experimentally observed roughening while for
low rates of the step flow (miscut 4deg), smooth surface can be obtained. In
the presence of almost immobile nitrogen atoms under N-rich conditions, the
growth is realized by the process of two-dimensional island nucleation and
coalescence. Additionally, we show that higher crystal miscut, lower crystal
growth rate or higher temperature results in similar effect of the smoothening
of the surface. We show that the surface also smoothens for the growth
conditions with very high N-excess. The presence of large number of nitrogen
atoms changes locally mobility of gallium atoms thus providing easier
coalescence of separated island.

curve can be computed by removing the extraneous components of the resultant of
two certain polynomials computed from the parametrization of the curve.
Furthermore, it is also well known that the implicit equation provided by the
non-extraneous component of this resultant has at most two irreducible factors.
In this paper, we complete the algebraic description of this resultant by
showing that the multiplicity of the factors corresponding to the offset can be
computed in advance. In particular, when the parametrization is proper, i.e.
when the curve is just traced once by the parametrization, we prove that any
factor corresponding to a simple component of the offset has multiplicity 1,
while the factor corresponding to the special component, if any, has
multiplicity 2. Hence, if the parametrization is proper and there is no special
component, the non-extraneous part of the resultant is square-free. In fact,
this condition is proven to be also sufficient. Additionally, this result
provides a simple test to check whether or not a given rational curve is the

network since more opportunities arise for each block to be decoded as the
number of used relays NRU is increased. This feature leads to benefits in terms
of diversity and multiplexing gains that are proven with the help of an
analytical outage model and a diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) analysis.

satisfaction algorithms which can be exhaustive (backtracking) or otherwise
(local search). However, most research in this area tested their algorithms by
simulation on a single PC with a single program entry point. The main
contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a truly
distributed constraint solver based on a local search algorithm using Java
Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE) to enable communication between agents on
different machines. Particularly, we discuss design and implementation issues
related to truly distributed constraint solver which might not be critical when
simulated on a single machine. Evaluation results indicate that our truly

tested with various distributed CSPs. Our application can also incorporate any
constraint solving algorithm with little modifications.

average spin-down rate of the source is measured to be $\sim 1.52 \times

term spin-down rate of the source is measured to be about two orders smaller
than this long-term spin-down rate. The orbit of the source is found to be
circular which is atypical for transient Be/X-ray binary systems. Hardness
ratios of the source correlate with the X-ray luminosity up to $8.4\times

hardness ratios remain constant. Pulsed fractions are found to be correlated
with the source flux. Overall \emph{Swift}$-$XRT and \emph{RXTE}$-$PCA energy

treatment on a continuous and potentially highly skewed response variable, the
generalized quantile treatment effect (GQTE). The GQTE is defined as the
difference between a function of the quantiles under the two treatment
conditions. As such, it represents a generalization over the standard
approaches typically used for estimating a treatment effect (i.e., the average
treatment effect and the quantile treatment effect) because it allows the
comparison of any arbitrary characteristic of the outcome's distribution under
the two treatments. Following Dominici et al. (2005), we assume that a
pre-specified transformation of the two quantiles is modeled as a smooth
function of the percentiles. This assumption allows us to link the two quantile
functions and thus to borrow information from one distribution to the other.
The main theoretical contribution we provide is the analytical derivation of a
closed form expression for the likelihood of the model. Exploiting this result
we propose a novel Bayesian inferential methodology for the GQTE. We show some
finite sample properties of our approach through a simulation study which
confirms that in some cases it performs better than other nonparametric
methods. As an illustration we finally apply our methodology to the 1987
National Medicare Expenditure Survey data to estimate the difference in the
single hospitalization medical cost distributions between cases (i.e., subjects
affected by smoking attributable diseases) and controls.

energy cosmic rays (UHECR) data as a powerful probe of the validity of special
relativity. This applies in particular to the propagation of cosmic rays from
their sources to Earth, responsible for energy suppressions due to pion
photoproduction by UHE protons (the Greisen-Zatsepin Kuzmin limit) and photo
disintegration of UHE nuclei (the Gerasimova-Rozental limit). A suppression in
the flux of UHECRs at energies above 40 EeV -- as expected from both these
interactions -- has been established experimentally beyond any doubt by current
experiments. However, such an observation is still not conclusive on the origin
of the suppression. In particular, data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can
be interpreted in a scenario in which the suppression is due to the maximum
acceleration energy at the sources rather than to interactions in the
background radiation. In this scenario, UHECR data can no longer yield bounds
on Lorentz invariance violations which increase the thresholds for interactions
of nuclei on background photons, in particular through modification of the
dispersion relations. Here we argue in turn that the study of UHECRs still
represents an opportunity to test Lorentz invariance, by discussing the
possibility of deriving limits on violation parameters from UHECR phenomena
other than propagation. In particular we study the modifications of the shower
development in the atmosphere due to the possible inhibition of the decay of
unstable particles, especially neutral pions.

super-resolution tells us that perfect recovery of unknown spike locations and
weights from low-pass Fourier transform measurements is possible provided that
the minimum spacing, $\Delta$, between spikes is not too small. Specifically,
for a measurement cutoff frequency of $f_c$, Donoho [2] showed that exact
recovery is possible if the spikes (on $\mathbb{R}$) lie on a lattice and
$\Delta > 1/f_c$, but does not specify a corresponding recovery method.
Cand$\text{\`e}$s and Fernandez-Granda [3, 4] provide a convex programming
method for the recovery of periodic spike trains (i.e., spike trains on the
torus $\mathbb{T}$), which succeeds provably if $\Delta > 2/f_c$ and $f_c \geq
128$ or if $\Delta > 1.26/f_c$ and $f_c \geq 10^3$, and does not need the
spikes within the fundamental period to lie on a lattice. In this paper, we
develop a theory of super-resolution from short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
measurements. Specifically, we present a recovery method similar in spirit to
the one in [3] for pure Fourier measurements. For a STFT Gaussian window
function of width $\sigma = 1/(4f_c)$ this method succeeds provably if $\Delta
> 1/f_c$, without restrictions on $f_c$. Our theory is based on a
measure-theoretic formulation of the recovery problem, which leads to
considerable generality in the sense of the results being grid-free and
applying to spike trains on both $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{T}$. The case of
spike trains on $\mathbb{R}$ comes with significant technical challenges. For
recovery of spike trains on $\mathbb{T}$ we prove that the correct solution can
be approximated---in weak-* topology---by solving a sequence of
finite-dimensional convex programming problems.

reveals an interesting connection between the problem of controllability and

systems is the tuning of the controller parameters. Typically, a model of the
system is used to obtain an initial controller, but ultimately the controller
parameters must be tuned manually on the real system to achieve the best
performance. To avoid this manual tuning step, methods from machine learning,
such as Bayesian optimization, have been used. However, as these methods
evaluate different controller parameters on the real system, safety-critical
system failures may happen. In this paper, we overcome this problem by
applying, for the first time, a recently developed safe optimization algorithm,
SafeOpt, to the problem of automatic controller parameter tuning. Given an
initial, low-performance controller, SafeOpt automatically optimizes the
parameters of a control law while guaranteeing safety. It models the underlying
performance measure as a Gaussian process and only explores new controller
parameters whose performance lies above a safe performance threshold with high
probability. Experimental results on a quadrotor vehicle indicate that the
proposed method enables fast, automatic, and safe optimization of controller
parameters without human intervention.

cotranslational folding on a model ribosome may enhance the odds to form
trefoil knots for protein YibK without any need to introduce any non-native

the protein. On-ribosome folding proceeds through a a slipknot conformation. We
elucidate the mechanics and energetics of its formation. We show that the

that there is an optimal temperature for the process. Our model often leads to

magnetic flux and the helicity per unit length along the FR axis. We show that
these quantities are statistically independent of the position along the FR

evaluate the total magnetic flux and helicity crossing the sphere of radius of
1 AU, centered at the Sun, per year and during a solar cycle. We also include
in the study two sets of small FRs which do not have all the typical
characteristics of MCs. While small FRs are at least ten times more numerous
than MCs, the magnetic flux and helicity are dominated by the contribution from
the larger MCs. They carry in one year the magnetic flux of about 25 large
active regions and the magnetic helicity of 200 of them. MCs carry away an
amount of unsigned magnetic helicity comparable to the one estimated for the

potentials for a prototype system which consists of a trapped electron coupled
to a quantized electromagnetic mode in an optical high-Q cavity. While the
effective current that acts on the photons is known explicitly, the exact
effective potential that describes the forces exerted by the photons on the
electrons is obtained from a fixed-point inversion scheme. This procedure
allows us to uncover important beyond-mean-field features of the effective
potential which mark the breakdown of classical light-matter interactions. We
observe peak and step structures in the effective potentials, which can be
attributed solely to the quantum nature of light, i.e., they are real-space
signatures of the photons. Our findings show how the ubiquitous dipole
interaction with a classical electromagnetic field has to be modified in
real-space in order to take the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field

correlations has been proven to retrieve more information than any classical
source. In particular, the quantum-classical comparison has been performed
under a global energy constraint, i.e., by fixing the mean total number of
photons irradiated over each memory cell. In this paper we provide an
alternative analysis which is based on a local energy constraint, meaning that
we fix the mean number of photons per signal mode irradiated over the memory
cell. Under this assumption, we investigate the critical number of signal modes
after which a nonclassical source of light is able to beat any classical source
irradiating the same number of signals.

processes that influence the structure of molecular clouds. Star-forming clouds
can best be characterized by lognormal PDFs for the lower N range and a
power-law tail for higher N, commonly attributed to turbulence and self-gravity
and/or pressure, respectively. We report here on PDFs obtained from
observations of 12CO, 13CO, C18O, CS, and N2H+ in the Cygnus X North region and
compare to a PDF derived from dust observations with the Herschel satellite.
The PDF of 12CO is lognormal for Av~1-30, but is cut for higher Av due to
optical depth effects. The PDFs of C18O and 13CO are mostly lognormal up for
Av~1-15, followed by excess up to Av~40. Above that value, all CO PDFs drop,
most likely due to depletion. The high density tracers CS and N2H+ exhibit only
a power law distribution between Av~15 and 400, respectively. The PDF from dust
is lognormal for Av~3-15 and has a power-law tail up to Av~500. Absolute values
for the molecular line column densities are, however, rather uncertain due to
abundance and excitation temperature variations. Taken the dust PDF face value,
we 'calibrate' the molecular line PDF of CS to the one of the dust and
determined an abundance [CS]/[H2] of 10^-9. The slopes of the power-law tails
of the CS, N2H+, and dust PDFs are consistent with free-fall collapse of
filaments and clumps. A quasi static configuration of filaments and clumps can
possibly also account for the observed N-PDFs, as long as they have a
sufficiently condensed density structure and external ram pressure by gas
accretion is provided. The somehow flatter slopes of N2H+ and CS can reflect an
abundance change and/or subthermal excitation at low column densities.

environments genetically identical cells can make random choices leading to
different phenotypes. This randomness originates from fluctuations present in
the biomolecular interaction networks. Most previous work has been focused on
the intrinsic noise (IN) of these networks. Yet, especially for
high-copy-number biomolecules, extrinsic or environmental noise (EN) has been
experimentally shown to dominate the variation. Here, we develop an analytical
formalism that allows for calculation of the effect of EN on gene-expression
motifs. We introduce a method for modeling bounded EN as an auxiliary species
in the master equation. The method is fully generic and is not limited to
systems with small EN magnitudes. We focus our study on motifs that can be
viewed as the building blocks of genetic switches: a nonregulated gene, a
self-inhibiting gene, and a self-promoting gene. The role of the EN properties
(magnitude, correlation time, and distribution) on the statistics of interest
are systematically investigated, and the effect of fluctuations in different
reaction rates is compared. Due to its analytical nature, our formalism can be
used to quantify the effect of EN on the dynamics of biochemical networks and
can also be used to improve the interpretation of data from single-cell
gene-expression experiments.

transverse field muon-spin rotation ($\mu$SR) spectroscopy. $\lambda(T)$
follows an exponential-type temperature dependence at $T\ll T_{c}$, but its
zero-temperature value $\lambda(0)$ increases linearly with magnetic field.
Detailed analyses demonstrate that both $\lambda(T)$ and the corresponding

described by a two-gap $\gamma$ model with gap sizes of
$\Delta_1(0)=1.31k_{B}T_c$ and $\Delta_2(0)=1.80k_{B}T_c$ and a very weak

classical Fuglede conjecture in locally compact abelian groups says that a set

disproved by T. Tao in Euclidean spaces of dimensions 5 and higher, using
constructions over prime fields (in vector spaces over finite fields of prime
order) and lifting them to the Euclidean setting. Over prime fields, when the
dimension of the vector space is less than or equal to $2$ it has recently been
proven that the Fuglede conjecture holds (see \cite{IMP15}). In this paper we
study this question in higher dimensions over prime fields and provide some
results and counterexamples. In particular we prove the existence of spectral
sets which do not tile in $\mathbb{Z}_p^5$ for all odd primes $p$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_p^4$ for all odd primes $p$ such that $p \equiv 3 \text{ mod } 4$.
Although counterexamples in low dimensional groups over cyclic rings

the end-nodes, which are identical in terms of the coupling environment and
dynamical equations. Namely, the symmetry of the end-nodes is broken and
co-existing groups with different synchronization features and attractor
geometries emerge. Surprisingly, such chimera states are very wide-spread in
this network topology, and large parameter regimes of moderate coupling
strengths evolve to chimera states from generic random initial conditions.
Further, we verify the robustness of these chimera states in analog circuit
experiments. Thus it is evident that star networks provide a promising class of

from a possibly proper class, such as games on the ordinals---is not provable
in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ZFC or G\""odel-Bernays set theory GBC, if these

proper class game with no definable winning strategy. In fact, the principle of
open determinacy and even merely clopen determinacy for class games implies
Con(ZFC) and iterated instances Con(Con(ZFC)) and more, because it implies that
there is a satisfaction class for first-order truth and indeed a transfinite
tower of truth predicates for iterated truth-about-truth, relative to any class
parameter. This is perhaps explained, in light of the Tarskian recursive
definition of truth, by the more general fact that the principle of clopen

transfinite recursion ETR over well-founded class relations. Meanwhile, the

a fundamental quantity to understand the physical processes involved in the
reionization epoch. We have investigated a sample of star-forming galaxies at
z~3.3 in order to search for possible detections of LyC photons escaping from
galaxy halos. UV deep imaging in the COSMOS field obtained with the prime focus
camera LBC at the LBT telescope was used together with a catalog of
spectroscopic redshifts obtained by the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) to build
a sample of 45 galaxies at z~3.3 with L>0.5L*. We obtained deep LBC images of
galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the interval 3.27<z<3.40 both in the R
and deep U bands. A sub-sample of 10 galaxies apparently shows escape
fractions>28% but a detailed analysis of their properties reveals that, with
the exception of two marginal detections (S/N~2) in the U band, all the other 8
galaxies are most likely contaminated by the UV flux of low-z interlopers
located close to the high-z targets. The average escape fraction derived from
the stacking of the cleaned sample was constrained to fesc_rel<2%. The implied
HI photo-ionization rate is a factor two lower than that needed to keep the IGM
ionized at z~3, as observed in the Lyman forest of high-z QSO spectra or by the
proximity effect. These results support a scenario where high redshift,
relatively bright (L>0.5L*) star-forming galaxies alone are unable to sustain
the level of ionization observed in the cosmic IGM at z~3. Star-forming
galaxies at higher redshift and at fainter luminosities (L<<L*) can be the
major contributors to the reionization of the Universe only if their physical
properties are subject to rapid changes from z~3 to z~6-10. Alternatively,
ionizing sources could be discovered looking for fainter sources among the AGN
population at high-z.

propose a gray code order of antenna index permutations for DSM. To facilitate
the implementation, the well-known Trotter-Johnson ranking and unranking

the existing DSM that uses the lexicographic order. The coding gain achieved by
the proposed gray code order over the existing lexicographic order is also
analyzed and verified via simulations, which reveals a maximum of about 1.2dB
for the case of four transmit antennas. Based on the gray coding framework, we
further propose a diversity-enhancing scheme named intersected gray (I-gray)
code order for DSM, where the permutations of active antenna indices are
selected directly from the odd (even) positions of the full permutations in the
gray code order. From analysis and simulations, it is shown that the I-gray

one information bit loss for each transmission with respect to the gray code
order.

perpendicular disks that remain distinct and drive the kinematics right into
the very centre of this object. In order to match this observed structure for

discrete or real-valued is constantly increasing. While existing kernel methods
are effective techniques for dealing with graphs having discrete node labels,
their adaptation to non-discrete or continuous node attributes has been
limited, mainly for computational issues. Recently, a few kernels especially
tailored for this domain, and that trade predictive performance for
computational efficiency, have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a graph
kernel for complex and continuous nodes' attributes, whose features are tree
structures extracted from specific graph visits. The kernel manages to keep the
same complexity of state-of-the-art kernels while implicitly using a larger
feature space. We further present an approximated variant of the kernel which
reduces its complexity significantly. Experimental results obtained on six
real-world datasets show that the kernel is the best performing one on most of
them. Moreover, in most cases the approximated version reaches comparable
performances to current state-of-the-art kernels in terms of classification
accuracy while greatly shortening the running times.

HST/WFC3 morphological measurements. The results of nonparametric measurements
of DRG morphology are consistent with our rest-frame UVJ color classification:
quiescent DRGs are generally compact while star-forming DRGs tend to have
extended structures. We find the star formation rate (SFR) and the stellar mass
of star-forming DRGs present tight ""main sequence"" relations in all redshift
bins. Moreover, the specific SFR (sSFR) of DRGs increase with redshift in all
stellar mass bins and DRGs with higher stellar masses generally have lower
sSFRs, which indicates that galaxies were much more active on average in the
past, and star formation contributes more to the mass growth of low-mass
galaxies than to high-mass galaxies. The infrared (IR) derived SFR dominate the
total SFR of DRGs which occupy the high-mass range, implying that the $J-K$
color criterion effectively selects massive and dusty galaxies. DRGs with
higher $M_{*}$ generally have redder $(U-V)_\mathrm{rest}$ colors, and the
$(U-V)_\mathrm{rest}$ colors of DRGs become bluer at higher redshifts,
suggesting high-mass galaxies have higher internal dust extinctions or older
stellar ages and they evolve with time. Finally, we find that DRGs have
different overlaps with EROs, BzKs, IEROs and high-$z$ ULIRGs indicating DRGs
is not a special population and they can also be selected by other color
criteria.

through August 2012 in the X-ray and UV bands and by the Liverpool Telescope
from May through July 2012 in B and V. The light curves are variable and
significantly correlated between wavebands. Using cross-correlation analysis,
we compute the time lag between the X-ray and lower energy bands. These lags
are thought to be associated with the light travel time between the central
X-ray emitting region and areas further out on the accretion disc. The computed
lags support a thermal reprocessing scenario in which X-ray photons heat the
disc and are reprocessed into lower energy photons. Additionally, we fit the
lightcurves using CREAM, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code for a standard disc.
The best-fitting standard disc model yields unreasonably high super-Eddington
accretion rates. Assuming more reasonable accretion rates would result in
significantly under-predicted lags. If the majority of the reprocessing
originates in the disc, then this implies the UV/optical emitting regions of
the accretion disc are farther out than predicted by the standard thin disc
model. Accounting for contributions from broad emission lines reduces the lags
in B and V by approximately 25% (less than the uncertainty in the lag
measurements), though additional contamination from the Balmer continuum may
also contribute to the larger than expected lags. This discrepancy between the
predicted and measured interband delays is now becoming common in AGN where
wavelength-dependent lags are measured.

onto lines. Our investigation covers both general and self-similar sets.
  For general sets, the main result is the following: if a set in the plane has
Assouad dimension $s \in [0,2]$, then the projections have Assouad dimension at
least $\min\{1,s\}$ almost surely. Compared to the famous analogue for
Hausdorff dimension -- namely \emph{Marstrand's Projection Theorem} -- a
striking difference is that the words `at least' cannot be dispensed with: in
fact, for many planar self-similar sets of dimension $s < 1$, we prove that the
Assouad dimension of projections can attain both values $s$ and $1$ for a set
of directions of positive measure.
  For self-similar sets, our investigation splits naturally into two cases:
when the group of rotations is discrete, and when it is dense. In the `discrete
rotations' case we prove the following dichotomy for any given projection:
either the Hausdorff measure is positive in the Hausdorff dimension, in which
case the Hausdorff and Assouad dimensions coincide; or the Hausdorff measure is
zero in the Hausdorff dimension, in which case the Assouad dimension is equal
to 1. In the `dense rotations' case we prove that every projection has Assouad
dimension equal to one, assuming that the planar set is not a singleton.
  As another application of our results, we show that there is no
\emph{Falconer's Theorem} for Assouad dimension. More precisely, the Assouad
dimension of a self-similar (or self-affine) set is not in general almost
surely constant when one randomises the translation vectors.

observations of Jupiter's moons Europa and Ganymede obtained with HARPS from La

measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect due to the Earth's passage using the
same technique successfully adopted for the 2012 Venus Transit (Molaro et al
2013). The expected modulation in radial velocities was of about 20 cm/s but an
anomalous drift as large as 38 m/s, i.e. more than two orders of magnitude
higher and opposite in sign, was detected instead. The consistent behaviour of
the two spectrographs rules out instrumental origin of the radial velocity
drift and BiSON observations rule out the possible dependence on the Sun's
magnetic activity. We suggest that this anomaly is produced by the Opposition
Surge on Europa's icy surface, which amplifies the intensity of the solar
radiation from a portion of the solar surface centered around the crossing
Earth which can then be observed as a a sort of inverse Rossiter-McLaughling
effect. in fact, a simplified model of this effect can explain in detail most
features of the observed radial velocity anomalies, namely the extensions
before and after the transit, the small differences between the two
observatories and the presence of a secondary peak closer to Earth passage.
This phenomenon, observed here for the first time, should be observed every
time similar Earth alignments occur with rocky bodies without atmospheres. We
predict it should be observed again during the next conjunction of Earth and

standard methods to calculate phonon properties from first principles. Our
scheme can be applied to various phonon-related problems, such as
superconductivity, electron and thermal transport, thermoelectricity,
piezoelectricity, dielectricity and multiferroicity. We believe that the cDFPT
provides a firm basis for the understanding of the role of phonons in strongly
correlated materials. Here, we apply the scheme to the fullerene
superconductors and discuss how the realistic low-energy Hamiltonian is

from General Relativity (GR) in the high curvature regime, we discuss the
viability of Cosmic Inflation without scalar fields. For energy densities
higher than the new mass scale of the theory, a gravitating dust component is
shown to generically induce an accelerated expansion of the Universe. Within
such a simple scenario, inflation gracefully exits when the GR regime is
recovered, but the Universe would remain matter dominated. In order to
implement a reheating era after inflation, we then consider inflation to be
driven by a mixture of unstable dust species decaying into radiation. Because
the speed of sound gravitates within the Born-Infeld model under consideration,
our scenario ends up being predictive on various open questions of the
inflationary paradigm. The total number of e-folds of acceleration is given by
the lifetime of the unstable dust components and is related to the duration of
reheating. As a result, inflation does not last much longer than the number of
e-folds of deceleration allowing a small spatial curvature and large scale
deviations to isotropy to be observable today. Energy densities are
self-regulated as inflation can only start for a total energy density less than
a threshold value, again related to the species' lifetime. Above this
threshold, the Universe may bounce thereby avoiding a singularity. Another
distinctive feature is that the accelerated expansion is of the
superinflationary kind, namely the first Hubble flow function is negative. We
show however that the tensor modes are never excited and the tensor-to-scalar
ratio is always vanishing, independently of the energy scale of inflation.

can be presented and discussed in a proper way. We argue that change is
ontologically and epistemologically a more basic phenomenon than time. Time is
an abstract entity created by the human mind on the basis of the experience of
change. Physical reality is a process of ceaseless becoming and vanishing; time
is not a part of that process. Time is the abstract bank in relation to which
we measure the intensity and amount of the flow (change) of physical reality.
We must differentiate physical reality from abstract entities (language) by
means of which we speak about this reality. It is necessary to differentiate a
formal description (formulas) from its interpretation: a correct formal
description can be interpreted in a logically inconsistent and factually wrong
way. We argue that the discourse about the relativity of time joins (mixes)
physical reality and language, and gives an inconsistent interpretation of
correct formulas. Regarding the future of time, it has been said that
physicists are divided between two options: (1) to pin down a ""master time"", as
a measure of change of physical reality, and (2) to proclaim time ""out of
existence"". We argue that both options must be adopted, because time is (1) a
measure of change, created by the human mind, (2) and time is an abstract
entity that does not exist in physical reality.

allowing for arbitrage by packaging all assets and their forwards dynamics into
a stochastic principal fibre bundle, with a connection whose parallel transport
encodes discounting and portfolio rebalancing, and whose curvature measures, in
this geometric language, the 'instantaneous arbitrage capability' generated by
the market itself. The cashflow bundle is the vector bundle associated to this
stochastic principal fibre bundle for the natural choice of the vector space
fibre. The cashflow bundle carries a stochastic covariant differentiation
induced by the connection on the principal fibre bundle. The link between
arbitrage theory and spectral theory of the connection Laplacian on the vector
bundle is given by the zero eigenspace resulting in a parametrization of all
risk neutral measures equivalent to the statistical one. This indicates that a
market satisfies the (NFLVR) condition if and only if $0$ is in the discrete
spectrum of the connection Laplacian on the cash flow bundle or of the Dirac
Laplacian of the twisted cash flow bundle with the exterior algebra bundle. We
apply this result by extending Jarrow-Protter-Shimbo theory of asset bubbles
for complete arbitrage free markets to markets not satisfying the (NFLVR).
Moreover, by means of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, we prove that the Euler
characteristic of the asset nominal space is a topological obstruction to the
the (NFLVR) condition, and, by means of the Bochner-Weitzenb\""ock formula, the
non vanishing of the homology group of the cash flow bundle is revealed to be a
topological obstruction to (NFLVR), too. Asset bubbles are defined, classified

expresses only a limited and specific set of genes that defines the cell type.
During cell division, not only the genome, but also the cell type is inherited
by the daughter cells. This intriguing phenomenon is achieved by a variety of
processes that have been collectively termed epigenetics: the stable and
inheritable changes in gene expression patterns. This article reviews the
extremely rich and exquisitely multi-scale physical mechanisms that govern the
biological processes behind the initiation, spreading and inheritance of
epigenetic states. These include not only the changes in the molecular
properties associated with the chemical modifications of DNA and histone
proteins, such as methylation and acetylation, but also less conventional ones,
such as the physics that governs the three-dimensional organization of the
genome in cell nuclei. Strikingly, to achieve stability and heritability of
epigenetic states, cells take advantage of many different physical principles,
such as the universal behavior of polymers and copolymers, the general features
of non-equilibrium dynamical systems, and the electrostatic and mechanical
properties related to chemical modifications of DNA and histones. By putting
the complex biological literature under this new light, the emerging picture is
that a limited set of general physical rules play a key role in initiating,
shaping and transmitting this crucial ""epigenetic landscape"". This new
perspective not only allows to rationalize the normal cellular functions, but
also helps to understand the emergence of pathological states, in which the
epigenetic landscape becomes dysfunctional.
