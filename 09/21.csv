type of repeated sequences common in the human genome are tandem repeats, where
identical copies appear next to each other. For example, in the sequence
$AGTC\underline{TGTG}C$, $TGTG$ is a tandem repeat, that may be generated from
$AGTCTGC$ by a tandem duplication of length $2$. In this work, we investigate
the possibility of generating a large number of sequences from a \textit{seed},
i.e.\ a small initial string, by tandem duplications of bounded length. We
study the capacity of such a system, a notion that quantifies the system's
generating power. Our results include \textit{exact capacity} values for
certain tandem duplication string systems. In addition, motivated by the role
of DNA sequences in expressing proteins via RNA and the genetic code, we define
the notion of the \textit{expressiveness} of a tandem duplication system as the
capability of expressing arbitrary substrings. We then \textit{completely}
characterize the expressiveness of tandem duplication systems for general
alphabet sizes and duplication lengths. In particular, based on a celebrated
result by Axel Thue from 1906, presenting a construction for ternary
square-free sequences, we show that for alphabets of size 4 or larger, bounded
tandem duplication systems, regardless of the seed and the bound on duplication
length, are not fully expressive, i.e. they cannot generate all strings even as
substrings of other strings. Note that the alphabet of size 4 is of particular
interest as it pertains to the genomic alphabet. Building on this result, we
also show that these systems do not have full capacity. In general, our results
illustrate that duplication lengths play a more significant role than the seed
in generating a large number of sequences for these systems.

projective MV-algebra.
  Let $A$ be a retract of the free $n$-generator MV-algebra
$\mathcal{M}([0,1]^n)$ of McNaughton functions on $[0,1]^n$. We prove that the
number $\mathsf{r}(A)$ of retractions of $\mathcal{M}([0,1]^n)$ onto $A$ is
finite if, and only if, the maximal spectral space $\mu_A$ is homeomorphic to a
(Kuratowski) closed domain $M$ of $[0,1]^n$, in the sense that
$M=\mathsf{cl}(\mathsf{int}(M))$. Further, the closed domain condition is
decidable and $\mathsf{r}(A)$ is computable, once a retraction onto $A$ is
explicitly given. Thus every finitely generated projective MV-algebra $B$ comes
equipped with a new invariant $\iota(B)=\sup\{\mathsf{r}(A) \mid \mbox{$A\cong

pair events in which one top quark decays to $Wb$, with the $W$ boson decaying
leptonically, and the other top quark decays to $Hq$. The search is based on
$pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at

fb$^{-1}$. Data are analysed in the lepton-plus-jets final state, characterised
by an isolated electron or muon and at least four jets. The search exploits the
high multiplicity of $b$-quark jets characteristic of signal events, and
employs a likelihood discriminant that uses the kinematic differences between
the signal and the background, which is dominated by $t\bar{t} \to WbWb$
decays. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is
found, and observed (expected) 95% CL upper limits of 0.56% (0.42%) and 0.61%

Supersymmetry removes the quadratic divergencies of the SM and {\it predicts}
the Higgs mechanism from radiative electroweak symmetry breaking with a SM-like

solved for some domains and under certain circumstances. There are scenarios,
however, that have received little or no attention at all, despite its
relevance and applicability. One of such scenarios is early text
classification, where one needs to know the category of a document by using
partial information only. A document is processed as a sequence of terms, and
the goal is to devise a method that can make predictions as fast as possible.
The importance of this variant of the text classification problem is evident in
domains like sexual predator detection, where one wants to identify an offender
as early as possible. This paper analyzes the suitability of the standard naive
Bayes classifier for approaching this problem. Specifically, we assess its
performance when classifying documents after seeing an increasingly number of
terms. A simple modification to the standard naive Bayes implementation allows
us to make predictions with partial information. To the best of our knowledge
naive Bayes has not been used for this purpose before. Throughout an extensive
experimental evaluation we show the effectiveness of the classifier for early
text classification. What is more, we show that this simple solution is very
competitive when compared with state of the art methodologies that are more
elaborated. We foresee our work will pave the way for the development of more
effective early text classification techniques based in the naive Bayes
formulation.

structural health monitoring (SHM) due to relatively low-cost, easy

the application-specific dependability in terms of sensor fault detection and
tolerance. The dependability is also affected by a reduction on the quality of
monitoring when mitigating WSN constrains (e.g., limited energy, narrow
bandwidth). We address these by designing a dependable distributed WSN
framework for SHM (called DependSHM) and then examining its ability to cope
with sensor faults and constraints. We find evidence that faulty sensors can
corrupt results of a health event (e.g., damage) in a structural system without
being detected. More specifically, we bring attention to an undiscovered yet
interesting fact, i.e., the real measured signals introduced by one or more
faulty sensors may cause an undamaged location to be identified as damaged
(false positive) or a damaged location as undamaged (false negative) diagnosis.
This can be caused by faults in sensor bonding, precision degradation,
amplification gain, bias, drift, noise, and so forth. In DependSHM, we present
a distributed automated algorithm to detect such types of faults, and we offer
an online signal reconstruction algorithm to recover from the wrong diagnosis.
Through comprehensive simulations and a WSN prototype system implementation, we
evaluate the effectiveness of DependSHM.

feasible, Distance Estimation and Subset Indexing are the main approaches.
Although binary coding has been popular for implementing both techniques, n-ary
coding (known as Product Quantization) is also very effective for Distance
Estimation. However, their relative performance has not been studied for Subset
Indexing. We investigate whether binary or n-ary coding works better under
different retrieval strategies. This leads to the design of a new n-ary coding
method, ""Linear Subspace Quantization (LSQ)"" which, unlike other n-ary
encoders, can be used as a similarity-preserving embedding. Experiments on
image retrieval show that when Distance Estimation is used, n-ary LSQ
outperforms other methods. However, when Subset Indexing is applied,
interestingly, binary codings are more effective and binary LSQ achieves the
best accuracy.

planets by means of direct imaging in the L'-band using the Large Binocular
Telescope Interferometer mid-infrared camera. At the location of two prominent
dips in the dust distribution at ~70AU (~0.5"") from the central star we reach a

of the rings. Using evolutionary models we derive upper limits of ~10-15MJup at

have been able to detect companions sufficiently massive to open full gaps in
the disk. The structures detected at mm-wavelengths could be gaps in the
distributions of large grains on the disk midplane, caused by planets not
massive enough to fully open gaps. Future ALMA observations of the molecular
gas density profile and kinematics as well as higher contrast infrared
observations may be able to provide a definitive answer.

recovery guarantee for compressed sensing with weighted $\ell^1$ minimization

existing results, it is sharp (up to constants and log factors) for large
classes of functions regardless of the choice of weights. Second, by examining
the measurement condition in the recovery guarantee, we are able to suggest a
good overall strategy for selecting the weights. In particular, when applied to
the important case of multivariate approximation with orthogonal polynomials,
this weighting strategy leads to provably optimal estimates on the number of
measurements required, whenever the support set of the significant coefficients
is a so-called lower set. Finally, this guarantee can also be used to
theoretically confirm the benefits of alternative weighting strategies where
the weights are chosen based on prior support information. This provides a
theoretical basis for a number of recent numerical studies showing the
effectiveness of such approaches.

genetic material. While a great deal of research has flourished into the
inference of phylogenetic trees, statistical methods to infer phylogenetic
networks are still limited and under development. The main disadvantage of
existing methods is a lack of scalability. Here, we present a statistical
method to infer phylogenetic networks from multi-locus genetic data in a

through the coalescent model, and for horizontal inheritance of genes through
reticulation nodes in the network. Computation of the pseudolikelihood is fast
and simple, and it avoids the burdensome calculation of the full likelihood
which can be intractable with many species. Moreover, estimation at the
quartet-level has the added computational benefit that it is easily
parallelizable. Simulation studies comparing our method to a full likelihood
approach show that our pseudolikelihood approach is much faster without
compromising accuracy. We applied our method to reconstruct the evolutionary
relationships among swordtails and platyfishes ($Xiphophorus$: Poeciliidae),

machine states are typically represented by terms recording the contents of the
state components. When models are realistic and are stepped through thousands
of machine cycles, these terms can grow quite large and the cost of simplifying
them on each step grows. In this paper we describe an ACL2 book that uses HIDE
and metafunctions to facilitate the management of large terms representing such
states. Because the metafunctions for each state component updater are solely
responsible for creating state expressions (i.e., ""writing"") and the
metafunctions for each state component accessor are solely responsible for
extracting values (i.e., ""reading"") from such state expressions, they can
maintain their own normal form, use HIDE to prevent other parts of ACL2 from
inspecting them, and use honsing to uniquely represent state expressions. The
last feature makes it possible to memoize the metafunctions, which can improve
proof performance in some machine models. This paper describes a
general-purpose ACL2 book modeling a byte-addressed memory supporting ""mixed""
reads and writes. By ""mixed"" we mean that reads need not correspond (in address
or number of bytes) with writes. Verified metafunctions simplify such
""read-over-write"" expressions while hiding the potentially large state
expression. A key utility is a function that determines an upper bound on the
value of a symbolic arithmetic expression, which plays a role in resolving
writes to addresses given by symbolic expressions. We also report on a
preliminary experiment with the book, which involves the production of states

which is a variant of ACL2 that supports reasoning about the real and complex
numbers by way of non-standard analysis. More specifically, we extend a
framework for formally evaluating definite integrals of real-valued, continuous
functions using the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Our extended
framework is also applied to functions containing free arguments. Using this
framework, we are able to prove the orthogonality relationships between
trigonometric functions, which are the essential properties in Fourier series
analysis. The sum rule for definite integrals of indexed sums is also
formalized by applying the extended framework along with the First Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus and the sum rule for differentiation. The Fourier
coefficient formulas of periodic functions are then formalized from the
orthogonality relations and the sum rule for integration. Consequently, the
uniqueness of Fourier sums is a straightforward corollary.
  We also present our formalization of the sum rule for definite integrals of
infinite series in ACL2(r). Part of this task is to prove the Dini Uniform
Convergence Theorem and the continuity of a limit function under certain
conditions. A key technique in our proofs of these theorems is to apply the
overspill principle from non-standard analysis.

  Labeled Data",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classification and clustering are both important topics in statistical
learning. A natural question herein is whether predefined classes are really
different from one another, or whether clusters are really there. Specifically,
we may be interested in knowing whether the two classes defined by some class
labels (when they are provided), or the two clusters tagged by a clustering
algorithm (where class labels are not provided), are from the same underlying
distribution. Although both are challenging questions for the high-dimensional,
low-sample size data, there has been some recent development for both. However,
when it is costly to manually place labels on observations, it is often that
only a small portion of the class labels is available. In this article, we
propose a significance analysis approach for such type of data, namely
partially labeled data. Our method makes use of the whole data and tries to
test the class difference as if all the labels were observed. Compared to a
testing method that ignores the label information, our method provides a
greater power, meanwhile, maintaining the size, illustrated by a comprehensive
simulation study. Theoretical properties of the proposed method are studied
with emphasis on the high-dimensional, low-sample size setting. Our simulated
examples help to understand when and how the information extracted from the
labeled data can be effective. A real data example further illustrates the
usefulness of the proposed method.

wireless sensor nodes. However, the randomness inherent in the EH process may
cause significant delay for performing sensing operation and transmitting the

performance of EH sensor networks, where only the energy consumption of
transmission is considered, we consider the energy costs of both sensing and
transmission. Specifically, we consider an EH sensor that monitors some status
environmental property and adopts a harvest-then-use protocol to perform
sensing and transmission. To comprehensively study the delay performance, we
consider two complementary metrics and analytically derive their statistics:
(i) update age - measuring the time taken from when information is obtained by
the sensor to when the sensed information is successfully transmitted to the
sink, i.e., how timely the updated information at the sink is, and (ii) update
cycle - measuring the time duration between two consecutive successful
transmissions, i.e., how frequently the information at the sink is updated. Our
results show that the consideration of sensing energy cost leads to an
important tradeoff between the two metrics: more frequent updates result in
less timely information available at the sink.

frequency of low redshift galaxy-galaxy lensing systems in which the signature
of weak lensing might be directly detectable. We find good agreement between
these two approaches. In order to make a theoretical estimate of the weak
lensing shear, $\gamma$, for each galaxy in a catalogue, we have made an
estimate of the asymptotic circular velocity from the stellar mass using three
different approaches: from a simulation based relation, from an
empirically-derived relation, and using the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation.
Using data from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly redshift survey we estimate the
frequency of detectable weak lensing at low redshift. We find that to a
redshift of $z\sim 0.6$, the probability of a galaxy being weakly lensed by at
least $\gamma = 0.02$ is $\sim 0.01$. A scatter in the $M_*-M_h$ relation
results in a shift towards higher measured shears for a given population of
galaxies. Given this, and the good probability of weak lensing at low
redshifts, we have investigated the feasibility of measuring the scatter in the
$M_*-M_h$ relation using shear statistics. This is a novel measurement, and is
made possible because DSM is able to make individual \itshape direct~\upshape
shear measurements, in contrast to traditional weak lensing techniques which
can only make statistical measurements. We estimate that for a shear
measurement error of $\Delta\gamma = 0.02$ (consistent with the sensitivity of
DSM), a sample of $\sim$50,000 spatially and spectrally resolved galaxies would
allow a measurement of the scatter in the $M_*-M_h$ relation to be made. While

intensity of advertisements and referrals to potential users. A large user base
provides more profits to the online firm, but building a large user base
through advertisements and referrals is costly; therefore, the optimal policy
must balance the marginal benefits of adding users against the marginal costs
of sending advertisements and referrals. Our work offers three main insights:
(1) The optimal policy prescribes that a new online firm should offer many
advertisements and referrals initially, but then it should decrease
advertisements and referrals over time. (2) If the network effects decrease,
then the change in the optimal policy depends heavily on two factors i) the
level of patience of the online firm, where patient online firms are oriented
towards long term profits and impatient online firms are oriented towards short
term profits and, ii) the size of the user base. If the online firm is very
patient (impatient) and if the network effects decrease, then the optimal
policy prescribes it to be more (less) aggressive in posting advertisements and
referrals at low user base levels and less (more) aggressive in posting
advertisements and referrals at high user base levels. (3) The change in the
optimal policy when network effects decrease also depends heavily on the
heterogeneity in the user base, as measured in terms of the revenue generated
by each user. An online firm that generates most of its revenue from a core
group of users should be more aggressive and protective of its user base than a

groups. The simulations start with Jupiter and Saturn locked in the mutual 3:2
mean motion resonance plus 3 Neptune-mass planets in a compact orbital
configuration. Mutual planetary interactions during migration led one of the
Neptunes to be ejected in less than 10 Myr of evolution, causing Jupiter to
jump by about 0.3 au in semi-major axis. This introduces a large scale
instability in the studied populations of small bodies. After the migration
phase, the simulations are extended over 4 Gyr, and we compare the final
orbital structure of the simulated test particles to the current Main Belt of

to reproduce the present Main Belt, the primordial belt should have had a
distribution peaked at $\sim10^{\circ}$ in inclination and at $\sim0.1$ in
eccentricity. We discuss the implications of this for the Grand Tack model. The
results also indicate that neither primordial Hildas, nor Trojans, survive the

case of nitrogen, boron atoms prefer to form -B-B- pairs with the further
formation of -P-P-B-B-P-P- patterns along the phosphorene chains. The low
concentration of boron dopants converts the phosphorene from a semiconductor
into a semimetal with the simultaneous enhancement of its chemical activity.
Co-doping of phosphorene by both boron and nitrogen starts from the formation
of -B-N- pairs, which provide flat bands and the further transformation of
these pairs to hexagonal BN lines and ribbons across the phosphorene chains.

study the way in which energy is dissipated in the QGP created in $pA$

impacts on ecosystem status and processes as well as predictive tools such as

fitting to observed data is one major criterion to assess such credibility.
However, more attention has been given to the exploration of model behavior
than to a rigorous confrontation to observations, as the calibration of
ecosystem models is challenging in many ways. First, ecosystem models can only
be simulated numerically and are generally too complex for mathematical
analysis and explicit parameter estimation; secondly, the complex dynamics
represented in ecosystem models allow species-specific parameters to impact
other species parameters through ecological interactions; thirdly, critical
data about non-commercial species are often poor; lastly, technical aspects can
be impediments to the calibration with regard to the high computational cost
potentially involved and the scarce documentation published on fitting complex
ecosystem models to data. This work highlights some issues related to the
confrontation of complex ecosystem models to data and proposes a methodology
for a sequential multi-phases calibration of ecosystem models. We propose
criteria to classify the parameters of a model: model dependency and time
variability of the parameters. These criteria and the availability of
approximate initial estimates are used as decision rules to determine which
parameters need to be estimated, and their precedence order in the sequential

low radio frequencies (~50-200 MHz), is a promising probe of the physical
conditions of the inter-galactic medium during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of
Reionisation (EoR). The sky-averaged Hi signal is expected to be extremely weak
(~100 mK) in comparison to the Galactic foreground emission (~$10^4$ K).
Moreover, the sky-averaged spectra measured by ground-based instruments are
affected by chromatic propagation effects (of the order of tens of Kelvins)
originating in the ionosphere. We analyze data collected with the upgraded
BIGHORNS system deployed at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory to assess
the significance of ionospheric effects (absorption, emission and refraction)
on the detection of the global EoR signal. We measure some properties of the
ionosphere, such as the electron temperature ($T_e \approx$470 K at nighttime),
magnitude, and variability of optical depth ($\tau_{100 MHz} \approx$0.01 and
$\delta \tau \approx$0.005 at nighttime). According to the results of a
statistical test applied on a large data sample, very long integrations lead to
increased signal to noise even in the presence of ionospheric variability. This
is further supported by the structure of the power spectrum of the sky
temperature fluctuations, which has flicker noise characteristics at
frequencies $\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ Hz, but becomes flat below $\approx 10^{-5}$ Hz.
We conclude that the stochastic error introduced by the chromatic ionospheric
effects tends to zero in an average. Therefore, the ionospheric effects and
fluctuations are not fundamental impediments preventing ground-based
instruments from integrating down to the precision required by global EoR
experiments.

model does not lead to divergent results for any fastness parameter. The

inertial mode with azimuthal wave number $m=1$ superimposed on a solid body
rotation. By increasing the precession ratio, we observe a transition from the
laminar to a non-linear regime, which then breakdowns to turbulence for larger
precession ratio. Our measurements show that the transition to turbulence is
subcritical, with a discontinuity of the wall-pressure and the power
consumption at the threshold $\epsilon_{LT}$. The turbulence is self-sustained
below this threshold, describing a bifurcation diagram with a hysteresis. In
this range of the control parameters, the turbulent flows can suddenly collapse
after a finite duration, leading to a definitive relaminarization of the flow.
The average lifetime $\langle \tau \rangle$ of the turbulence increases rapidly
when $\epsilon$ tends to $\epsilon_{LT}$.

between a marker and the disease status is often tested by comparing the marker
allele frequencies among cases and controls. These marker allele frequencies
are expected to be different if the marker is associated with the disease. The
power of the commonly used allele based test is based on the marker allele
frequency; markers with a low minor allele frequency have less power to be
detected (if they are associated with the disease), than markers with high
minor allele frequency. Therefore the strategy of selecting markers for
follow-up study based on their p-values, favors markers with a high minor
allele frequency.
  We propose an allele based test that does not have this (unwanted) property
and is therefore more powerful for markers with a low minor allele frequency.
This test may, therefore, be more effective when searching for rare causal
variants. The asymptotic power function of the test is derived and simulation
studies are performed for finite sample properties of the test. Next, the
existing and the proposed tests are applied to data; this is not included yet.

account the excluded-volume interaction between monomers of a polymer chain
using the partition function. For binary mixtures of a long polymer and short

caused by short polymers by generalizing the partition function of the long

coil-globule transition is studied as a function of the concentration of mixed
polymers by systematically varying Flory's chi-parameters. We show that the

with light and matter degrees of freedom. The Kondo effect refers to the
screening of a spin-1/2 impurity by a cloud of conduction electrons, then
forming a many-body Fermi liquid ground state. The Kondo resonance produces a
phase shift in the transmitted electronic wave packet which depends on the
symmetry and nature of the many-body ground state. Theoretical calculations
suggest that the Kondo resonance can interact with the irradiation photon field
and should give rise to a {\pi}-phase shift of the photon signal in the case
where the ground state is a Fermi liquid. This {\pi}-phase shift of microwave
photon is driven from the Korringa-Shiba relation of quantum impurity
Fermi-liquid ground states. We report the first observation of such a
{\pi}-phase shift in a graphene double quantum dot within a circuit quantum
electrodynamics architecture where the microwave photons couple to the
pseudo-spin or charge degrees of freedom. The observed Kondo temperature TK ~
550 mK is in agreement with DC conductance measurements. All our results
support the formation of a Kondo resonance located above the Fermi level of the
electronic reservoirs and the occurrence of an SU(4) Fermi-liquid ground state.
We finally study how the Kondo-photon interactions can be tuned by inter-dot
electron tunnel coupling strengths. Our experimental achievements may
contribute to a better understanding of many-body physics in hybrid circuit
systems, and open up new applications in atomic thin materials from the
light-matter interaction.

incorporate color into the model is tackled by considering RGB images as
three-dimensional arrays, where the transport in the RGB direction is performed

gray-value images we propose two discrete variational models, a constrained and
a penalized one which can also handle unbalanced transport. We show that a
minimizer of our discrete model exists, but it is not unique for some special
initial/final images. For minimizing the resulting functionals we apply a
primal-dual algorithm. One step of this algorithm requires the solution of a
four-dimensional discretized Poisson equation with various boundary conditions
in each dimension. For instance, for the penalized approach we have
simultaneously zero, mirror and periodic boundary conditions. The solution can
be computed efficiently using fast Sin-I, Cos-II and Fourier transforms.

flux from deep, hot regions below the Fe cloud deck can emerge. The same
mechanism could account for color changes at the L/T transition and photometric
variability. We present the first observations of spectroscopic variability of
brown dwarfs covering the 0.99 $\mu$m FeH feature. We observed the spatially
resolved very nearby brown dwarf binary WISE J104915.57-531906.1 (Luhman 16AB),
a late-L and early-T dwarf, with HST/WFC3 in the G102 grism at 0.8-1.15 $\mu$m.
We find significant variability at all wavelengths for both brown dwarfs, with
peak-to-valley amplitudes of 9.3% for Luhman 16B and 4.5% for Luhman 16A. This
represents the first unambiguous detection of variability in Luhman 16A. We
estimate a rotational period between 4.5 and 5.5 h, very similar to Luhman 16B.
Variability in both components complicates the interpretation of spatially
unresolved observations. The probability for finding large amplitude
variability in any two brown dwarfs is less than 10%. Our finding may suggest
that a common but yet unknown feature of the binary is important for the
occurrence of variability. For both objects, the amplitude is nearly constant
at all wavelengths except in the deep K I feature below 0.84 $\mu$m. No
variations are seen across the 0.99 $\mu$m FeH feature. The observations lend
strong further support to cloud height variations rather than holes in the
silicate clouds, but cannot fully rule out holes in the iron clouds. We
re-evaluate the diagnostic potential of the FeH feature as a tracer of cloud
patchiness.

essential to exploit the full potential of ground-based telescopes in the
context of exoplanet detection and characterization. However, the drawback of
this attractive feature is a high sensitivity to pointing errors, which
degrades the performance of the coronagraph. We propose a tip-tilt retrieval
technique based on the analysis of the final coronagraphic image, hereafter
called Quadrant Analysis of Coronagraphic Images for Tip-tilt Sensing (QACITS).
Under the assumption of small phase aberrations, we show that the behaviour of
the vortex phase mask can be simply described from the entrance pupil to the
Lyot stop plane by Zernike polynomials. This convenient formalism is used to
establish the theoretical basis of the QACITS technique. Simulations have been
performed to demonstrate the validity and limits of the technique, including
the case of a centrally obstructed pupil. The QACITS technique principle is
further validated by experimental results in the case of an unobstructed
circular aperture. The typical configuration of the Keck telescope (24% central
obstruction) has been simulated with additional high order aberrations. In
these conditions, our simulations show that the QACITS technique is still
adapted to centrally obstructed pupils and performs tip-tilt retrieval with a
precision of $5 \times 10^{-2}$ {\lambda}/D when wavefront errors amount to
{\lambda}/14 rms and $10^{-2}$ {\lambda}/D for {\lambda}/70 rms errors (with
{\lambda} the wavelength and D the pupil diameter). The implementation of the
QACITS technique is based on the analysis of the scientific image and does not
require any modification of the original setup. Current facilities equipped
with a vortex phase mask can thus directly benefit from this technique to
improve the contrast performance close to the axis.

studied yet: (i) The impact of the number of 2D landmarks; (ii) the impact of
the number of 3D vertices; (iii) the way of using standalone automated landmark
detection methods; and (iv) the convergence property. To answer these
questions, a simplified cascaded regression based 3D face reconstruction method
is devised, which can be integrated with standalone automated landmark
detection methods and reconstruct 3D face shapes that have the same pose and
expression as the input face images, rather than normalized pose and
expression. Moreover, an effective training method is proposed by disturbing
the automatically detected landmarks. Comprehensive evaluation experiments have
been done with comparison to other 3D face reconstruction methods. The results
not only deepen the understanding of cascaded regression based 3D face
reconstruction approaches, but also prove the effectiveness of proposed method.

TeV, produces hundreds of exabytes of data per year, making it one of the
largest sources of data in the world today. At present it is not possible to
even transfer most of this data from the four main particle detectors at the
LHC to ""offline"" data facilities, much less to permanently store it for future
processing. For this reason the LHC detectors are equipped with real-time
analysis systems, called triggers, which process this volume of data and select
the most interesting proton-proton collisions. The LHC experiment triggers
reduce the data produced by the LHC by between 1/1000 and 1/100000, to tens of
petabytes per year, allowing its economical storage and further analysis. The
bulk of the data-reduction is performed by custom electronics which ignores
most of the data in its decision making, and is therefore unable to exploit the
most powerful known data analysis strategies. I cover the present status of
real-time data analysis at the LHC, before explaining why the future upgrades
of the LHC experiments will increase the volume of data which can be sent off
the detector and into off-the-shelf data processing facilities (such as CPU or
GPU farms) to tens of exabytes per year. This development will simultaneously
enable a vast expansion of the physics programme of the LHC's detectors, and
make it mandatory to develop and implement a new generation of real-time
multivariate analysis tools in order to fully exploit this new potential of the
LHC. I explain what work is ongoing in this direction and motivate why more
effort is needed in the coming years.

the shapes of the free-energy barriers of higher co-ordination structures

behaviour over the last three solar cycles with variations in the SMP

the IntCal13 $^{14}$C data to investigate distinct patterns in the occurrences

these patterns might mimic the recent solar magnetic activity by investigating
the evolution of the energy in the Sun's large-scale dipolar magnetic field

analysis shows that $\sim$71\% of grand maxima during the period from 6600 BC

grand maxima and minima are consistent with the scenario in which the dynamical
non-linearity induced by the Lorentz force leads the Sun to act as a relaxation
oscillator. This finding implies that the probability for these events to occur
is non-uniformly distributed in time, as there is a memory in their driving
mechanism, which can be identified via the back reaction of the Lorentz force.

substantially wider confidence intervals than the geometric mean, undermining
its value for any except the largest sample sizes.

flow over charge modulated surfaces in a generalized paradigm when the
classically restrictive ""weak field"" limit may be relaxed. Going beyond the
commonly portrayed weak field limit (i.e, the externally applied electric field
is over-weighed by the surface-induced electrical potential, towards charge
distribution in an electrified wall-adhering layer) for electroosmotic
transport, we numerically solve the coupled full set of Poisson-Nernst-Planck
(PNP) and Navier-Stokes equations, in a semi-infinite domain, bounded at the
bottom by a charged wall. Further, in an effort to obtain deeper physical
insight, we solve the simplified forms of the relevant governing equations for
low surface potential in two separate asymptotic limits: (i) a regular
perturbation solution for Low Ionic Peclet number (Pe), where Pe is employed as
the gauge function and (ii) a matched asymptotic solution for O(1) Pe in the
Thin Electric Double Layer (EDL) limit. We demonstrate that reasonably good
agreement is observed between the analytical and numerical solutions. Our
analysis reveals that the primary effect of Pe on the flow is to slow down the
""free stream velocity"", adding to the periodicity of the flow, while it also
induces significant changes in the overall potential. We further show that the
electrical double layer thickness strongly dictates the ""free stream velocity"",
and a simple Smoluchowski type of slip boundary condition cannot be used, if
the effect of advection is taken into account. These results can be of
significant importance in designing microfluidic and nanofluidic systems with
surface charge modulation.

routing. We consider two optimal control problems: the DTA problem, where
turning ratios are part of the control inputs, and the Freeway Network Control
(FNC), where turning ratios are instead assigned exogenous parameters. It is
known that relaxation of the supply and demand constraints in the cell-based
formulations of the DTA problem results in a linear program. However, solutions
to the relaxed problem can be infeasible with respect to traffic dynamics.
Previous work has shown that such solutions can be made feasible by proper
choice of ramp metering and variable speed limit control for specific traffic
networks. We extend this procedure to arbitrary networks and provide insight
into the structure and robustness of the proposed optimal controllers. For a
network consisting only of ordinary, merge, and diverge junctions, where the
cells have linear demand functions and affine supply functions with identical
slopes, and the cost is the total traffic volume, we show, using the maximum
principle, that variable speed limits are not needed in order to achieve
optimality in the FNC problem, and ramp metering is sufficient. We also prove
bounds on perturbation of the controlled system trajectory in terms of
perturbations in initial traffic volume and exogenous inflows. These bounds,
which leverage monotonicity properties of the controlled trajectory, are shown
to be in close agreement with numerical simulation results.

be a probability distribution over a space $\Omega^\ell$ with all $\ell$
marginals equal. Let $\underline{X}^{(1)}, \ldots, \underline{X}^{(\ell)}$
where $\underline{X}^{(j)} = (X_1^{(j)}, \ldots, X_n^{(j)})$ be random vectors
such that for every coordinate $i \in [n]$ the tuples $(X_i^{(1)}, \ldots,
X_i^{(\ell)})$ are i.i.d. according to $\mathcal{P}$.
  A central question that is addressed in both areas is:
  - Does there exist a function $c_{\mathcal{P}}()$ independent of $n$ such
that for every $f: \Omega^n \to [0, 1]$ with $\mathrm{E}[f(X^{(1)})] = \mu >
0$: \begin{align*} \mathrm{E} \left[ \prod_{j=1}^\ell f(X^{(j)}) \right]

  Instances of this question include the finite field model version of Roth's
and Szemer\'edi's theorems as well as Borell's result about the optimality of
noise stability of half-spaces.
  Our goal in this paper is to interpolate between the noise stability theory
and the finite field additive combinatorics theory and address the question
above in further generality than considered before. In particular, we settle
the question for $\ell = 2$ and when $\ell > 2$ and $\mathcal{P}$ has bounded
correlation $\rho(\mathcal{P}) < 1$. Under the same conditions we also
characterize the _obstructions_ for similar lower bounds in the case of $\ell$
different functions. Part of the novelty in our proof is the combination of
analytic arguments from the theories of influences and hyper-contraction with
arguments from additive combinatorics.

production events outside the LHC detectors having suppressed standard model
back-ground and missing energy. Resonant leptogenesis in this case is
implemented by a pair of quasi-degenerate sterile neutrinos of the second and

new alternative scenario where the models allow the second generation sterile
neutrino mass to be ${\cal O}(10)$ GeV capable of mediating the dominant double
beta decay as well as the displaced vertices for significantly improved number
of like-sign dilepton events in different channels. Resonant leptogenesis in
this alternative scenario is mediated by a pair of heavy quasi-degenerate
sterile neutrino masses of the first and the third generations. In addition to
QD type light neutrino mass hierarchy, we also show how these results are
derived for the NH case. We also discuss $Z'$ production cross sections at

of red giant stars. This relies on the properties of the global oscillations
with a mixed character that are highly sensitive to the physical properties of
the core. However, overlapping rotational splittings and mixed-mode spacings
result in complex structures in the mixed-mode pattern, which severely
complicates its identification and the measurement of the asymptotic period
spacing. This work aims at disentangling the rotational splittings from the
mixed-mode spacings, in order to open the way to a fully automated analysis of
large data sets. An analytical development of the mixed-mode asymptotic
expansion is used to derive the period spacing between two consecutive mixed
modes. The \'echelle diagrams constructed with the appropriately stretched
periods are used to exhibit the structure of the gravity modes and of the
rotational splittings. We propose a new view on the mixed-mode oscillation
pattern based on corrected periods, called stretched periods, that mimic the
evenly spaced gravity-mode pattern. This provides a direct understanding of all
oscillation components, even in the case of rapid rotation. The measurement of
the asymptotic period spacing and the signature of the structural glitches on
mixed modes are then made easy. This work opens the possibility to derive all
seismic global parameters in an automated way, including the identification of
the different rotational multiplets and the measurement of the rotational
splitting, even when this splitting is significantly larger than the period
spacing. Revealing buoyancy glitches provides a detailed view on the radiative
core.

symmetry breaking (SSB) gauge theory. The extended AHM (E-AHM) adds certain
heavy scalars $\Phi$ and fermions $\psi$. In Lorenz gauge, these theories have
a global U(1) conserved physical current, but no conserved charge. As shown by
Kibble, the Goldstone theorem applies, there is a massless derivatively coupled
Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB). Proof of all-loop-orders renormalizability and
unitarity is tricky because the BRST-invariant Lagrangian is not U(1)
symmetric. Nevertheless, Slavnov-Taylor identities guarantee that on-shell
T-matrix elements of physical states are independent of anomaly-free gauge
transformations. We observe that they are therefore also independent of the
usual anomaly-free U(1) global transformations. It follows that the associated
global current, is exactly conserved for amplitudes of physical states. We
identify corresponding Ward-Takahashi identities (WTI). In Lorenz gauge, two
towers of ""1-soft-pion"" global WTI govern the scalar-sector, and represent a
new global U(1)xBRST symmetry not of the Lagrangian but of the physics. The
first gives relations among off-shell Green's functions, the second governs
on-shell T-matrix elements, replacing the Adler self-consistency conditions.
These WTI constrain the all-loop-orders scalar-sector low-energy effective
Lagrangian. Consequently, certain heavy CP-conserving heavy matter
representations decouple completely in the $M_{Heavy}^2/m_{Weak}^2 \to \infty$
limit. SSB (E-)AHM physics therefore has more symmetry than does its
BRST-invariant Lagrantian. The NGB decouples from the observable particle
spectrum in the usual way, when the observable vector absorbs it, as if it were
a gauge transformation, hiding both towers of WTI from observable particle
physics.

resulting relations to the $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ Linear Sigma
Model including the heaviest generation of Standard Model (SM) fermions
supplemented with the minimum necessary neutrino content -- right-handed
neutrinos and Yukawa-coupling-induced Dirac neutrino mass. We extract powerful
constraints on the effective Lagrangian: e.g. showing that they make separate
tadpole renormalization unnecessary, and guarantee infra-red finiteness.
Crucially, ultra-violet quadratic divergences (UVQD) and all other relevant
operators contribute only to $m_\pi^2$, a Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB)
mass-squared. A WTI between T-Matrix elements (i.e. the Goldstone Theorem) then
enforces $ m_\pi^2=0$ for the true NGB in the spontaneous symmetry breaking
mode of the theory. All relevant operator contributions originating to
all-loop-orders from virtual scalars, quarks and leptons, vanish identically!
  Our regularization-scheme-independent results are unchanged by the addition
of certain heavy CP-conserving matter, such as originate in certain Beyond the
SM models. We demonstrate this with two examples: a heavy singlet real scalar
field with $Z_2$ symmetry and no VEV; and a heavy singlet right-handed Type I
See-saw Majorana neutrino. Specifically, we prove that these heavy degrees of

hole mergers. The phenomenology of these systems can be divided in three
classes: nondisruptive, mildly disruptive or disruptive. The cutoff frequency
of the gravitational radiation produced during the merger (which is potentially
measurable by interferometric detectors) is very different in each regime, and
when the merger is disuptive it carries information on the neutron star
equation of state. Here we use semianalytical tools to derive a formula for the
critical binary mass ratio $Q=M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm NS}$ below which mergers are
disruptive as a function of the stellar compactness $\mathcal{C}=M_{\rm
NS}/R_{\rm NS}$ and the dimensionless black hole spin $\chi$. We then employ a
new gravitational waveform amplitude model, calibrated to $134$ general
relativistic numerical simulations of binaries with black hole spin
(anti-)aligned with the orbital angular momentum, to obtain a fit to the
gravitational-wave cutoff frequency in the disruptive regime as a function of
$\mathcal{C}$, $Q$ and $\chi$. Our findings are important to build
gravitational wave template banks, to determine whether neutron star-black hole

motivation from and make connections to Large Deviations theory, and in
particular, the celebrated G\""{a}rtner-Ellis theorem. We analyze a series of
well studied examples where this limiting behavior occurs, such as fixed
markets with vanishing risk aversion, the basis risk model with high

the Black-Scholes-Merton model with either vanishing default probabilities or
vanishing transaction costs. Lastly, we show that the large claim regime could
naturally arise in partial equilibrium models.

astrophysical neutrinos at 5.7{\sigma} significance from an all-flavor search.
The direct detection of tau neutrinos in this flux has yet to occur. Tau
neutrinos become distinguishable from other flavors in IceCube at energies
above a few hundred TeV, when the cascade from the tau neutrino charged current
interaction becomes resolvable from the cascade from the tau lepton decay. This
paper presents results from a dedicated search for tau neutrinos with energies
between 214 TeV and 72 PeV. The analysis searches for IceCube optical sensors
that observe two separate pulses in a single event - one from the tau neutrino
interaction, and a second from the tau decay. This is the first IceCube tau
neutrino search to be more sensitive to tau neutrinos than to any other
neutrino flavor. No candidate events were observed in three years of IceCube
data. For the first time, a differential upper limit on astrophysical tau
neutrinos is derived around the PeV energy region, which is nearly three orders
of magnitude lower in energy than previous limits from dedicated tau neutrino
searches.

feedback is initiated, with similar total mass and physical size as the Serpens
Core. We derive temperature and column density maps also from the simulations.
The observed distribution of column densities of the filaments has been
analysed first including and then masking the cores. The same analysis has been
performed on the simulations as well. A radial network of filaments has been
detected in the Serpens Core. The analysed simulation shows a striking
morphological resemblance to the observed structures. The column density
distribution of simulated filaments without cores shows only a log-normal
distribution, while the observed filaments show a power-law tail. The power-law
tail becomes evident in the simulation if one focuses just on the column
density distribution of the cores. In contrast, the observed cores show a flat
distribution. Even though the simulated and observed filaments are subjectively
similar-looking, we find that they behave in very different ways. The simulated
filaments are turbulence-dominated regions, the observed filaments are instead
self-gravitating structures that will probably fragment into cores.

  Non-linearizable Concurrent Objects","18 pages",,,,"cs.LO cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Designing scalable concurrent objects, which can be efficiently used on
multicore processors, often requires one to abandon standard specification
techniques, such as linearizability, in favor of more relaxed consistency
requirements. However, the variety of alternative correctness conditions makes
it difficult to choose which one to employ in a particular case, and to compose
them when using objects whose behaviors are specified via different criteria.
The lack of syntactic verification methods for most of these criteria poses
challenges in their systematic adoption and application.
  In this paper, we argue for using Hoare-style program logics as an
alternative and uniform approach for specification and compositional formal
verification of safety properties for concurrent objects and their client
programs. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate how an existing
program logic for concurrency can be employed off-the-shelf to capture
important state and history invariants, allowing one to explicitly quantify
over interference of environment threads and provide intuitive and expressive
Hoare-style specifications for several non-linearizable concurrent objects that
were previously specified only via dedicated correctness criteria. We
illustrate the adequacy of our specifications by verifying a number of
concurrent client scenarios, that make use of the previously specified
concurrent objects, capturing the essence of such correctness conditions as
concurrency-aware linearizability, quiescent, and quantitative quiescent
consistency. All examples described in this paper are verified mechanically in
Coq.

boundary value problem under certain `nonresonance' conditions, and also
Rabinowitz-type global bifurcation results, which yield nodal solutions of the
problem.
  These results rely on the spectral properties of the eigenvalue problem
consisting of the equation $$-u'' = \lambda u, \quad \text{on} \quad (-1,1),$$
together with the multi-point boundary conditions. In a previous paper it was
shown that, under certain `optimal' conditions, the basic spectral properties
of this eigenvalue problem are similar to those of the standard Sturm-Liouville
problem with single-point boundary conditions. In particular, for each integer
$k \geq 0$ there exists a unique, simple eigenvalue $\lambda_k$, whose
eigenfunctions have `oscillation count' equal to $k$, where the `oscillation
count' was defined in terms of a complicated Pr\""ufer angle construction.
  Unfortunately, it seems to be difficult to apply the Pr\""ufer angle
construction to the nonlinear problem. Accordingly, in this paper we use
alternative, non-optimal, oscillation counting methods to obtain the required
spectral properties of the linear problem, and these are then applied to the
nonlinear problem to yield the results mentioned above.

drivers, input uncertainty, state uncertainty, or instrument faults and thus
unknown-input reconstruction has several wide-spread applications. In this
paper we consider delayed recursive reconstruction of states and unknown inputs
for both square and non-square systems. That is, we develop filters that use
current measurements to estimate past states and reconstruct past inputs. We
further derive necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence of filter
estimates and show that these convergence properties are related to
multivariable zeros of the system. With the help of illustrative examples we
highlight the key contributions of this paper in relation with the existing
literature. Finally, we also show that existing unbiased minimum-variance
filters are special cases of the proposed filters and as a consequence the
convergence results in this paper also apply to existing unbiased
minimum-variance filters.

polynomial $F\in\mathbb{C}[x]$. Given an oracle that provides approximations of
each of the coefficients of $F$ to any absolute error bound and given an
arbitrary square $\mathcal{B}$ in the complex plane containing only simple
roots of $F$, our algorithm returns disjoint isolating disks for the roots of
$F$ in $\mathcal{B}$. Our complexity analysis bounds the absolute error to
which the coefficients of $F$ have to be provided, the total number of
iterations, and the overall bit complexity. It further shows that the
complexity of our algorithm is controlled by the geometry of the roots in a
near neighborhood of the input square $\mathcal{B}$, namely, the number of
roots, their absolute values and pairwise distances. The number of subdivision
steps is near-optimal. For the \emph{benchmark problem}, namely, to isolate all
the roots of a polynomial of degree $n$ with integer coefficients of bit size
less than $\tau$, our algorithm needs $\tilde O(n^3+n^2\tau)$ bit operations,
which is comparable to the record bound of Pan (2002). It is the first time
that such a bound has been achieved using subdivision methods, and independent
of divide-and-conquer techniques such as Sch\""onhage's splitting circle
technique. Our algorithm uses the quadtree construction of Weyl (1924) with two
key ingredients: using Pellet's Theorem (1881) combined with Graeffe iteration,
we derive a ""soft-test"" to count the number of roots in a disk. Using
Schr\""oder's modified Newton operator combined with bisection, in a form
inspired by the quadratic interval method from Abbot (2006), we achieve
quadratic convergence towards root clusters. Relative to the divide-conquer
algorithms, our algorithm is quite simple with the potential of being
practical. This paper is self-contained: we provide pseudo-code for all
subroutines used by our algorithm.

  $$W_{\mu,\mu_c}(R;F) = \mu\, \| sym(R^T F - 1) \|^2 + \mu_c\, \| skew(R^T F -

  We aim at the derivation of closed form expressions for the minimizers of
$W(R;F)$ in $SO(3)$, i.e., for the set of optimal Cosserat microrotations in
dimension $n = 3$, as a function of $F \in GL^+(n)$. In a previous contribution
(Part I), we have first shown that, for all $n \geq 2$, the full range of
weights $\mu > 0$ and $\mu_c \geq 0$ can be reduced to either a classical or a
non-classical limit case. We have then derived the associated closed form
expressions for the optimal planar rotations in $SO(2)$ and proved their global
optimality. In the present contribution (Part II), we characterize the
non-classical optimal rotations in dimension n = 3. After a lift of the
minimization problem to the unit quaternions, the Euler-Lagrange equations can
be symbolically solved by the computer algebra system Mathematica. Among the
symbolic expressions for the critical points, we single out two candidates
$rpolar^{\pm}_{\mu,\mu_c}(F) \in SO(3)$ which we analyze and for which we can
computationally validate their global optimality by Monte Carlo statistical
sampling of $SO(3)$. Geometrically, our proposed optimal Cosserat rotations
$rpolar^{\pm}_{\mu,\mu_c}(F)$ act in the ""plane of maximal strain"" and our
previously obtained explicit formulae for planar optimal Cosserat rotations in
$SO(2)$ reveal themselves as a simple special case. Further, we derive the
associated reduced energy levels of the Cosserat shear--stretch energy and
criteria for the existence of non-classical optimal rotations.

flow, Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzi-White conjectured that the entropy of any
closed surface is at least that of the self-shrinking two-sphere. We prove this
conjecture for all closed embedded $2$-spheres. Assuming a conjectural Morse
index bound (announced recently by Marques-Neves), we can improve the result to
apply to all closed embedded surfaces that are not tori. Our results can be
thought of as the parabolic analog to the Willmore conjecture and our argument
is analogous in many ways to that of Marques-Neves on the Willmore problem. The
main tool is the min-max theory applied to the Gaussian area functional in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ which we also establish. To any closed surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$
we associate a four parameter canonical family of surfaces and run a min-max
procedure. The key step is ruling out the min-max sequence approaching a
self-shrinking plane, and we accomplish this with a degree argument. To
establish the min-max theory for $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Gaussian weight, the
crucial ingredient is a tightening map that decreases the mass of
non-stationary varifolds (with respect to the Gaussian metric of
$\mathbb{R}^3$) in a continuous manner.

using extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Although models that have frustrated
interactions and lack translational invariance might be expected to display
spin glass behaviour, we show that the spin system has a phase transition to
low-temperature states with long-range quasiperiodic magnetic order.
Additionally, we find that in some of the systems spin clusters can fluctuate
much below the ordering temperature.

detailed sub-parsec scale imaging of the base of both jet and counter-jet can

appear self-absorbed at longer wavelengths and enables an extremely sharp view
towards the nucleus to be obtained. We performed 7 mm Global VLBI observations,
achieving ultra-high resolution imaging on scales down to 90 $\mu$as. This
resolution corresponds to a linear scale of only ${\sim}$400 Schwarzschild
radii (for $M_{\mathrm{BH}}=2.5 \times 10^9 M_{\odot}$). We studied the
kinematic properties of the main emission features of the two-sided flow and
probed its transverse structure through a pixel-based analysis. We suggest that
a fast and a slow layer, with different acceleration gradients, exist in the
flow. The extension of the acceleration region is large (${\sim} 10^4
R_{\mathrm{S}}$), indicating that the jet is magnetically-driven. The limb
brightening of both jet and counter-jet and their large opening angles
($\phi_\mathrm{J}{\sim} 10^{\circ}$) strongly favor a spine-sheath structure.
In the acceleration zone, the flow has a parabolic shape ($r\propto z^{0.55\pm
0.07}$). The acceleration gradients and the collimation profile are consistent
with the expectations for a jet in ""equilibrium'' (Lyubarsky 2009), achieved in
the presence of a mild gradient of the external pressure ($p\propto z^{-k},

by the emergence of an extensive number of local conserved operators that
prevents the relaxation towards thermal equilibrium. These local conserved
operators can be seen as the building blocks of the whole set of eigenstates.
In this paper, we propose to construct them explicitly via some block
real-space renormalization. The principle is that each RG step diagonalizes the
smallest remaining blocks and produces a conserved operator for each block. The
final output for a chain of $N$ spins is a hierarchical organization of the $N$
conserved operators with $\left(\frac{\ln N}{\ln 2}\right)$ layers. The
system-size nature of the conserved operators of the top layers is necessary to
describe the possible long-ranged order of the excited eigenstates and the
possible critical points between different FMBL phases. We discuss the
similarities and the differences with the Strong Disorder RSRG-X method that
generates the whole set of the $2^N$ eigenstates via a binary tree of $N$
layers. The approach is applied to the Long-Ranged Quantum Spin-Glass Ising
model, where the constructed excited eigenstates are found to be exactly like
ground states in another disorder realization, so that they can be either in
the paramagnetic phase, in the spin-glass phase or critical.

individually contribute at different metallicities, and thus at different
galactic ages. The level of uncertainty then depends on the metallicity and is
different from one element to another. Among the seven input parameters
considered in this work, the slope of the IMF and the number of SNe Ia are
currently the two main sources of uncertainty.

decreasing to zero for t going to infinity). Also it has to be specified that

absorbed exponentially as t going to infinity by the null solution.

several anisotropic turbulent systems. We present for the first time direct
evidence of such a transition thanks to a three-dimensional direct numerical
simulation of incompressible balanced MHD turbulence with a grid resolution of
$3072^2 \times 256$. From large to small-scales, the change of regime is
characterized by i) a change of slope in the energy spectrum going from
approximately $-2$ to $-3/2$; ii) an increase of the ratio between the wave and
nonlinear times, with a critical ratio of $\chi_{c}\sim0.35$; iii) an absence
followed by a dramatic increase of the communication between Alfv\'en modes;

from a purely perpendicular cascade to a cascade compatible with the critical

the solar system and local ISM. The oxygen isotope ratios are consistent with

account for a simplified treatment of time-dependent chemistry and the
non-isothermal nature of gas and dust. We perform simulations using an initial
density of n_0 = 10^3 cm^{-3} and a mass of 1.3x10^5 M_sun. Furthermore, we
vary the virial parameter, defined as the ratio of kinetic and potential
energy, alpha = E_{kin} / |E_{pot}|, by adjusting the velocity dispersion. We
set it to alpha = 0.5, 2.0 and 8.0, in order to analyze the impact of the
kinetic energy on our results. We account for the extreme conditions in the CMZ
and increase both the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and the cosmic-ray
flux (CRF) by a factor of 1000 compared to the values found in the solar
neighbourhood. We use the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D to compute synthetic
images in various diagnostic lines. These are [CII] at 158 micron, [OI] (145
micron), [OI] (63 micron), 12CO (J = 1 -> 0) and 13CO (J = 1 -> 0) at 2600
micron and 2720 micron, respectively. When alpha is large, the turbulence
disperses much of the gas in the cloud, reducing its mean density and allowing
the ISRF to penetrate more deeply into the cloud's interior. This significantly
alters the chemical composition of the cloud, leading to the dissociation of a
significant amount of the molecular gas. On the other hand, when alpha is
small, the cloud remains compact, allowing more of the molecular gas to
survive. We show that in each case the atomic tracers accurately reflect most
of the physical properties of both the H2 and the total gas of the cloud and
that they provide a useful alternative to molecular lines when studying the ISM
in the CMZ.

by radio observations of Fermi unassociated sources are black widow pulsars
(BWPs). BWPs are binary millisecond pulsars with companion masses ranging from
0.01-0.1 solar masses which often exhibit radio eclipses. The bloated
companions in BWP systems exert small torques on the system causing the orbit
to change on small but measurable time scales. Because adding parameters to a
timing model reduces sensitivity to a gravitational wave (GW) signal, the need
to fit many orbital frequency derivatives to the timing data is potentially
problematic for using BWPs to detect GWs with pulsar timing arrays. Using
simulated data with up to four orbital frequency derivatives, we show that
fitting for orbital frequency derivatives absorbs less than 5% of the low
frequency spectrum expected from a stochastic gravitational wave background
signal. Furthermore, this result does not change with orbital period.
Therefore, we suggest that if timing systematics can be accounted for by
modeling orbital frequency derivatives and is not caused by spin frequency
noise, pulsar timing array experiments should include BWPs in their arrays.

one-dimensional coupled Yajima--Oikawa system, which is comprised of
multicomponent short-wave and one component long-wave, is proposed by using
Hirota's bilinear method. Based on the reductions of the B\""{a}cklund
transformations of the semi-discrete BKP hierarchy, both the bright and dark
soliton (for the short-wave components) solutions in terms of pfaffians are
constructed.

a city is a complex network. The complex network constitutes a unique
topological perspective on cities and enables us to better understand the kind
of problem a city is. The topological perspective differentiates it from the
perspectives of Euclidean geometry and Gaussian statistics that deal with
essentially regular shapes and more or less similar things. Many urban
theories, such as the Central Place Theory, Zipf's Law, the Image of the City,
and the Theory of Centers can be interpreted from the point of view of complex
networks. A livable city consists of far more small things than large ones, and
their shapes tend to be irregular and rough. This chapter illustrates the
complex network view and argues that we must abandon the kind of thinking
(mis-)guided by Euclidean geometry and Gaussian statistics, and instead adopt
fractal geometry, power-law statistics, and Alexander's living geometry to
develop sustainable cities.

approach is to useoperations (Minkowski sum and intersection) on sets of
constraints. These constraints aremade compliant with half-spaces of R^n where
each set of half-spaces defines an operandpolyhedron. These operands are
generally unbounded due to the inclusion of degrees ofinvariance for surfaces
and degrees of freedom for joints defining theoretically
unlimiteddisplacements. To solve operations on operands, Minkowski sums in
particular, ""cap"" halfspacesare added to each polyhedron to make it compliant
with a polytope which is bydefinition a bounded polyhedron. The difficulty of
this method lies in controlling the influenceof these additional half-spaces on
the topology of polytopes calculated by sum or intersection.This is necessary
to validate the geometric tolerances that ensure the compliance of amechanical
system in terms of functional requirements.

  Linearized Evolution","21 pages, 11 figures, special issue",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work lipid ordering phase changes arising in planar membrane bilayers
is investigated both accounting for elas- ticity alone and for effective
viscoelastic response of such assemblies. The mechanical response of such
membranes is studied by minimizing the Gibbs free energy which penalizes
perturbations of the changes of areal stretch and their gradients only [1]. As
material instabilities arise whenever areal stretches characterizing
homogeneous configurations lie inside the spinoidal zone of the free energy
density, bifurcations from such configurations are shown to occur as
oscillatory perturbations of the in-plane displacement. Experimental
observations [2] show a power-law in-plane viscous behavior of lipid structures
allowing for an effective viscoelastic behavior of lipid membranes [3], which
falls in the framework of Fractional Hereditariness. A suitable generalization
of the variational principle invoked for the elasticity is applied in this
case, and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation is found together with a
set of bound- ary and initial conditions. Separation of variables allows for
showing how Fractional Hereditariness owes bifurcated modes with a larger
number of spatial oscillations than the corresponding elastic analog. Indeed,
the available range of areal stresses for material instabilities is found to
increase with respect to the purely elastic case. Nevertheless, the time
evolution of the perturbations solving the Euler-Lagrange equation above
exhibits time-decay and the large number of spatial oscillation slowly relaxes,
thereby keeping the features of a long-tail type time-response.

perspective that the gas has a well-defined wavefunction description at all
times. Specifically, the internal energy and volume exclusion of decorrelated
vortex structures are included so that quantum corrections and modifications to
Navier-Stokes behavior can be derived. This leads to a small deviation in rigid
body rotation for a cylindrically bound gas and the internal energy changes
associated with vorticity give deviations in the Reynolds' transport theorem.
Some macroscopic observable features arising from this include variations in
the specific heat, an anisotropic correction to thermal conductivity and a
variation in optical scattering as a function of the declination from the axis
of local vorticity. The improvements in magneto-optical traps suggests some
interesting experiments to be done in higher temperature regimes where they are
not usually employed. It is argued that the finite lifetime of observed
vortices in ultracold bosonic gases is only apparent and these volume excluding
structures persist in generating angular momentum and pressure in the cloud in
a non-imageable form.
