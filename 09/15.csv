applied to study generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications, which give rise
to a bosonic subsector of half-maximal, electrically gauged supergravities. In
contrast to the flux formulation of original DFT, the covariant fluxes split
into a fluctuation and a background part. The latter is connected to a
$2D$-dimensional, pseudo Riemannian manifold, which is isomorphic to a Lie
group embedded into O($D,D$). All fields and parameters of generalized
diffeomorphisms are supported on this manifold, whose metric is spanned by the
background vielbein $E_A{}^I \in$ GL($2D$). This vielbein takes the role of the
twist in conventional generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications. By doing
so, it solves the long standing problem of constructing an appropriate twist
for each solution of the embedding tensor. Using the geometric structure,
absent in original DFT, $E_A{}^I$ is identified with the left invariant
Maurer-Cartan form on the group manifold, in the same way as it is done in
geometric Scherk-Schwarz reductions. We show in detail how the Maurer-Cartan
form for semisimple and solvable Lie groups is constructed starting from the
Lie algebra. For all compact embeddings in O($3,3$), we calculate $E_A{}^I$.

A new mobility parametrization, which also provides a better description of

method to the situation of non-uniform fields. For the fit method, the use of
the convolution theorem of Fourier transforms enabled us to precisely determine
the electronics transfer function of the complete set-up, including the sensor

of a relatively few (i.e. a mixture of) 'average' templates. EPM uses only a

months to 4 years make its detection efficiency for eclipsing binaries nearly
complete over this period range and for all radius ratios. Our investigation
employs a statistical framework akin to that used for inferring planetary
occurrence rates from planetary transits. The obvious simplification is that
eclipsing binaries have a vastly improved detection efficiency that is limited
chiefly by their geometric probabilities to eclipse. For the M-dwarf sample
observed by the Kepler Mission, the fractional incidence of eclipsing binaries
implies that there are $0.11 ^{+0.02} _{-0.04}$ close stellar companions per
apparently single M-dwarf. Our measured binarity is higher than previous
inferences of the occurrence rate of close binaries via radial velocity
techniques, at roughly the 2$\sigma$ level. This study represents the first use
of eclipsing binary detections from a high quality transiting planet mission to
infer binary statistics. Application of this statistical framework to the
eclipsing binaries discovered by future transit surveys will establish better
constraints on short-period M$+$M binary rate, as well as binarity measurements

  Control",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many uncertainty sets encountered in control systems analysis and design can
be expressed in terms of semialgebraic sets, that is as the intersection of
sets described by means of polynomial inequalities. Important examples are for
instance the solution set of linear matrix inequalities or the Schur/Hurwitz
stability domains. These sets often have very complicated shapes (non-convex,
and even non-connected), which renders very difficult their manipulation. It is
therefore of considerable importance to find simple-enough approximations of
these sets, able to capture their main characteristics while maintaining a low
level of complexity. For these reasons, in the past years several convex
approximations, based for instance on hyperrect-angles, polytopes, or
ellipsoids have been proposed. In this work, we move a step further, and
propose possibly non-convex approximations , based on a small volume polynomial
superlevel set of a single positive polynomial of given degree. We show how
these sets can be easily approximated by minimizing the L1 norm of the
polynomial over the semialgebraic set, subject to positivity constraints.
Intuitively, this corresponds to the trace minimization heuristic commonly
encounter in minimum volume ellipsoid problems. From a computational viewpoint,
we design a hierarchy of linear matrix inequality problems to generate these
approximations, and we provide theoretically rigorous convergence results, in
the sense that the hierarchy of outer approximations converges in volume (or,
equivalently, almost everywhere and almost uniformly) to the original set. Two
main applications of the proposed approach are considered. The first one aims
at reconstruction/approximation of sets from a finite number of samples. In the
second one, we show how the concept of polynomial superlevel set can be used to
generate samples uniformly distributed on a given semialgebraic set. The
efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated by different numerical
examples.

  This paper characterizes the power interference in CSMA/CA based networks

is quantized via an improved form of the Attacking Case metric as the original
form of this metric was developed for nodes using omnidirectional antenna.
  The proposed metric is attractive because it considers nodes using

interference in wireless networks using multiple transmission power schemes.
The improved Attacking Case metric is useful to study the aggregated throughput

increase of aggregated throughput. This reduction can be implemented using

literature to the public be more concerned with looking into both the content
that is available for free on the Web and any aspect that may come with writing

multidisciplinary consensus-driven space in which propositional knowledge is
given priority that it would be essential for entries on fiction to present
non-propositional knowledge as being one of its hallmarks. For this aim, a
special concept is developed that is designed to function as the study's formal
object: ""Erlesnis"" (which in German is a pun that combines ""Erlebnis"" -
adventure experience - and ""lesen"" - reading). It is defined as
non-propositional knowledge that has been acquired in an individual reading
process. Writing about one's own Erlesnis in new ways is being tried out in
four essays, and on de.wikipedia.org an experiment is conducted to find out
what community members think about the idea of including, in entries on
fiction, sections specifically designed to report about what people felt like

suggested. This contribution is the first of its kind internationally to deal

`bulk' is stabilized by the interplay between gravity and flux-quantization in
a dilaton-Maxwell-Einstein system such as commonly appears in
higher-dimensional supergravity and is used in the Supersymmetric Large Extra
Dimensions (SLED) program. Such systems enjoy a classical flat direction that
can be lifted by interactions with the branes, giving a mass to the would-be
modulus that is smaller than the KK scale. We construct the effective
low-energy 4D description appropriate below the KK scale once the transverse
extra dimensions are integrated out, and show that it reproduces the
predictions of the full UV theory for how the vacuum energy and modulus mass
depend on the properties of the branes and stabilizing fluxes. In particular we
show how this 4D theory learns the news of flux quantization through the
existence of a space-filling four-form potential that descends from the
higher-dimensional Maxwell field. We find a scalar potential consistent with
general constraints, like the runaway dictated by Weinberg's theorem. We show
how scale-breaking brane interactions can give this potential minima for which
the extra-dimensional size, $\ell$, is exponentially large relative to
underlying physics scales, $r_B$, with $\ell^2 = r_B^2 e^{- \varphi}$ where
$-\varphi \gg 1$ can be arranged with a small hierarchy between fundamental
parameters. We identify circumstances where the potential at the minimum can
(but need not) be parametrically suppressed relative to the tensions of the
branes, provide a preliminary discussion of the robustness of these results to
quantum corrections, and discuss the relation between what we find and earlier

particle (SEP) events and major geomagnetic storms associated with coronal mass
ejections (CMEs). We also considered interplanetary type II radio bursts, which
are indicative of energetic CMEs driving shocks. When we compared the CME
properties between the two SSN peaks, we find that more energetic CMEs occurred

the Beliaev damping process, in which a quasiparticle collides with the
condensate and resonantly decays into a pair of quasiparticles. Remarkably, the
rate for this process exhibits a highly non-trivial dependence on the
quasiparticle momentum and the dipolar interaction strength. For weak
interactions, the low energy phonons experience no damping, and the higher
energy quasiparticles undergo anomalously weak damping. In contrast, the
Beliaev damping rates become anomalously large for stronger dipolar
interactions, as rotons become energetically accessible as final states.
Further, we find a qualitative anisotropy in the damping rates when the dipoles
are tilted off the axis of symmetry. Our study reveals the unconventional
nature of Beliaev damping in dipolar condensates, and has important
implications for ongoing studies of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics in

classifying tweets according to the sentiment expressed in them: positive,
negative or neutral. Twitter is an online micro-blogging and social-networking
platform which allows users to write short status updates of maximum length 140
characters. It is a rapidly expanding service with over 200 million registered
users - out of which 100 million are active users and half of them log on
twitter on a daily basis - generating nearly 250 million tweets per day. Due to
this large amount of usage we hope to achieve a reflection of public sentiment
by analysing the sentiments expressed in the tweets. Analysing the public
sentiment is important for many applications such as firms trying to find out
the response of their products in the market, predicting political elections
and predicting socioeconomic phenomena like stock exchange. The aim of this
project is to develop a functional classifier for accurate and automatic
sentiment classification of an unknown tweet stream.

To develop a fully Bayesian least squares deconvolution (LSD) that can

We consider LSD under the Bayesian framework and we introduce a flexible
Gaussian Process (GP) prior for the LSD profile. This prior allows the result
to automatically adapt to the presence of signal. We exploit several linear
algebra identities to accelerate the calculations. The final algorithm can deal
with thousands of spectral lines in a few seconds. Results. We demonstrate the
reliability of the method with synthetic experiments and we apply it to real

magnetic signals using a small number of spectral lines, together with the
uncertainty at each velocity bin. This allows the user to consider if the
detected signal is reliable. The code to compute the Bayesian LSD profile is

pulling like-minded users that share the same interests together. In this
paper, we are interested in identifying communities of users that share similar

emerging topics on Twitter. We model each topic as a collection of highly
correlated semantic concepts observed in tweets and identify them by clustering
the time-series based representation of each concept built based on each

topics in a given time period, we utilize multivariate time series analysis to
model the contributions of each user towards the identified topics, which
allows us to detect latent user communities. Through our experiments on Twitter

its frequency- and wave-vector-dependent density response function, $\chi({\bf

fundamental bosonic charge excitations of the system, exhibiting peaks wherever
collective modes are present. $\chi$ quantifies the electronic compressibility
of a material, its response to external fields, its ability to screen charge,
and its tendency to form charge density waves. Unfortunately, there has never
been a fully momentum-resolved means to measure $\chi({\bf q},\omega)$ at the

interested in how local unitaries on the open system allow the appearance and
control of memory effects. Our first simple qubit model, where local unitary is
followed by dephasing, illustrates how memory effects arise despite of having
no-structure in the environment the system is coupled with. We then elaborate
this observation by constructing a model for open quantum walk where the
unitary coin and transfer operation is augmented with dephasing of the coin.
The results demonstrate that in the limit of strong dephasing within each

reasonable estimates for the uncertainty in the system state. Stochastic
differential equations are often used to mathematically model the underlying
system.
  The Kusuoka-Lyons-Victoir (KLV) approach is a higher order particle method
for approximating the weak solution of a stochastic differential equation that
uses a weighted set of scenarios to approximate the evolving probability
distribution to a high order of accuracy. The algorithm can be performed by
integrating along a number of carefully selected bounded variation paths. The
iterated application of the KLV method has a tendency for the number of
particles to increase. This can be addressed and, together with local dynamic
recombination, which simplifies the support of discrete measure without harming
the accuracy of the approximation, the KLV method becomes eligible to solve the
filtering problem in contexts where one desires to maintain an accurate
description of the ever-evolving conditioned measure.
  In addition to the alternate application of the KLV method and recombination,
we make use of the smooth nature of the likelihood function and high order
accuracy of the approximations to lead some of the particles immediately to the
next observation time and to build into the algorithm a form of automatic high

and are based on an improved version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics
code GADGET-3, which ameliorates gas mixing and better captures gas-dynamical
instabilities by including a suitable artificial thermal diffusion. In this
Letter, we focus our analysis on the entropy profiles, the primary diagnostic
we used to classify the degree of cool-coreness of clusters, and on the iron
profiles. In keeping with observations, our simulated clusters display a
variety of behaviors in entropy profiles: they range from steadily decreasing
profiles at small radii, characteristic of cool-core systems, to nearly flat
core isentropic profiles, characteristic of non-cool-core systems. Using
observational criteria to distinguish between the two classes of objects, we
find that they occur in similar proportions in both simulations and in
observations. Furthermore, we also find that simulated cool-core clusters have
profiles of iron abundance that are steeper than those of NCC clusters, which
is also in agreement with observational results. We show that the capability of
our simulations to generate a realistic cool-core structure in the cluster
population is due to AGN feedback and artificial thermal diffusion: their
combined action allows us to naturally distribute the energy extracted from
super-massive black holes and to compensate for the radiative losses of
low-entropy gas with short cooling time residing in the cluster core.

the rate are taken into account using a self-consistent modification of the

transverse momentum, shear viscosity, and initial momentum-space anisotropy.
Our findings indicate that both high-energy photon and dilepton production are

with a fault-tolerant transformation that will map logical qubits encoded in
two-dimensional (2D) color codes into stacked codes and back. The stacked code
allows for the transversal implementation of a non-Clifford $\pi/8$ logical
gate, which when combined with the logical Clifford gates that are transversal
in the 2D color code give a gate set which is both fault-tolerant and universal
without requiring nonstabilizer magic states. We then show that the layers
forming the stacked code can be unfolded and arranged in a 2D layout. As only
Clifford gates can be implemented transversally for 2D topological stabilizer
codes, a non-local operation must be incorporated in order to allow for this
transversal application of a non-Clifford gate. Our code achieves this
operation through the transformation from a 2D color code to the unfolded
stacked code induced by measuring only geometrically local stabilizers and
gauge operators within the bulk of 2D color codes together with a nonlocal
operator that has support on a one-dimensional boundary between such 2D codes.
We believe that this proposed method to implement the non-local operation is a
realistic one for 2D stabilizer layouts and would be beneficial in avoiding the
large overheads caused by magic state distillation.

product expansion is to physically interpret the resulting time evolution by
decomposing the Hilbert space of the states for the entire system into those

high attenuation and vulnerability to blockage of 60 GHz links have limited its
applications (until recently) to short-range, line-of-sight, static scenarios.
On the other hand, the question of whether it is feasible to build
general-purpose WLANs out of mmWave radios in dynamic indoor environments with
non-line-of-sight links remains largely unanswered. In this paper, through
extensive measurements with COTS 802.11ad hardware in an indoor office
environment, we investigate the question of whether the mmWave technology, in
spite of its unique propagation characteristics, can serve as a viable choice
for providing multi-Gigabit ubiquitous wireless indoor connectivity. We study
the range of 60 GHz transmissions in indoor environments, the impact of antenna
height, location, orientation, and distance on 60 GHz performance, the
interaction among metrics from different layers of the network stack, the
increased opportunities for spatial reuse, and the impact of human blockage.
Our results reveal a number of challenges that we have to address for 60 GHz

the dynamical state of the fossils by the X-ray peak/brightest cluster galaxy

  Most fossils are identified as cool-core objects via at least two cool-core

the X-ray peak, and most also have the emission weighted centre within that

power law model, albeit with indices smaller than 1. The 400d fossils Lx-T

Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey, the tidal disruption of a star by a massive
black hole? We address two aspects of the problem: the composition of the
putative disrupted object (using the spectroscopic data), and the energetics of
the observed gas and radiation (using the photometric data). We perform
photoionization calculations and compare with the observed lower limit of the
line ratio L(He II 4686)/L(Halpha) > 5 to argue that this event was not the
disruption of a solar-type star, and instead was likely the disruption of a
helium core (as first proposed by Gezari et al. 2012). Disruption of such a
dense object requires a relatively small central BH, M_BH <~ 2 x 10^5 M_sun. We
use the photometric data to infer that PS1-10jh comprised an outflow of ~ 0.01
M_sun of gas, escaping from the BH at ~1000 km/s, and we propose that this
outflow was driven primarily by radiation pressure trapped by Thomson and
resonance line scattering. The large ratio of radiated energy to kinetic
energy, E_rad/E_K ~ 10^4, together with the large value of E_rad ~ 2 x 10^(51)
erg, suggests that the outflow was shocked at large radius (perhaps similar to
super-luminous supernovae or the internal shock model for gamma-ray bursts). We
describe puzzles in the physics of PS1-10jh, and discuss how this event may
help us understand future tidal disruptions and super-Eddington accretion
events as well.

responsible for the creation of a transition disc. We have studied their
combined effect through a suite of 2d simulations of protoplanetary discs
undergoing X-ray photoevaporation with an embedded giant planet. In a previous
work we explored how the formation of a giant planet triggers the dispersal of
the inner disc by photo-evaporation at earlier times than what would have
happened otherwise. This is particularly relevant for the observed transition
discs with large holes and high mass accretion rates that cannot be explained
by photo-evaporation alone. In this work we significantly expand the parameter
space investigated by previous simulations. In addition, the updated model
includes thermal sweeping, needed for studying the complete dispersal of the
disc. After the removal of the inner disc the disc is a non accreting
transition disc, an object that is rarely seen in observations. We assess the
relative length of this phase, to understand if it is long lived enough to be
found observationally. Depending on the parameters, especially on the X-ray
luminosity of the star, we find that the fraction of time spent as a
non-accretor greatly varies. We build a population synthesis model to compare
with observations and find that in general thermal sweeping is not effective
enough to destroy the outer disc, leaving many transition discs in a relatively
long lived phase with a gas free hole, at odds with observations. We discuss
the implications for transition disc evolution. In particular, we highlight the
current lack of explanation for the missing non-accreting transition discs with
large holes, which is a serious issue in the planet hypothesis.

potentially-gap-generating interactions and potentially-localizing disorder. In
this paper, we compute the low-temperature DC and AC electrical and thermal

The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity, which is
characterized by the parameter $\Delta_X$, is a power law, $\sigma \propto
1/T^{1 - 2(2-\Delta_X)}$ when $\Delta_X \geq 2$, down to zero temperature when
the Fermi surface is commensurate with the lattice. There is a surface in
parameter space along which $\Delta_X = 2$ and $\Delta_X \approx 2$ for small
deviations from this surface. In the generic (incommensurate) case with weak
disorder, such scaling is seen at high-temperatures, followed by an exponential
increase of the conductivity $\ln \sigma \sim 1/T$ at intermediate temperatures
and, finally, $\sigma \propto 1/T^{2-2(2-{\Delta_X})}$ at the lowest

multiplicity due to to some symmetry. Null results from LHC searches already
seem to disfavor such partners if they are colored. Any partners with SM
charges and ~TeV masses will be exhaustively probed by the LHC and a future 100
TeV collider. Therefore, we focus on neutral top partners. While these arise in
Twin Higgs theories, we analyze neutral top partners as model-independently as
possible using EFT and Simplified Model methods. We classify all perturbative
neutral top partner structures in order to compute their irreducible low-energy
signatures at proposed future lepton and hadron colliders, as well as the
irreducible tunings suffered in each scenario. Central to our theorem is the
assumption that SM-charged BSM states appear in the UV completion of neutral
naturalness, which is the case in all known examples. Direct production at the
100 TeV collider then allows this scale to be probed at the ~10 TeV level. We
find that proposed future colliders probe any such scenario of naturalness with
tuning of 10% or better. This provides very strong model-independent motivation
for both new lepton and hadron colliders, which in tandem act as discovery
machines for general naturalness. We put our results in context by discussing
other possibilities for naturalness, including ""swarms"" of top partners,
inherently non-perturbative or exotic physics, or theories without SM-charged

cross sections in $e^+e^-$ collisions with an energy veto $\Lambda$ on
additional jets. The key observation is that there are actually two pairs of
energy scales whose ratio is $R$: the transverse momentum $QR$ of the energetic
particles inside jets and their total energy $Q$, and the transverse momentum
$\Lambda R$ of soft particles that are cut out of the jet cones and their
energy $\Lambda$. The soft-collinear mode is necessary to factorize and resum
logarithms of the latter hierarchy. We show how this factorization occurs in
the jet thrust cross section for cone and $k_T$-type algorithms at
$O(\alpha_s)$ and using the thrust cone algorithm at $O(\alpha_s^2)$. We
identify the presence of hard-collinear, in-jet soft, global (veto) soft, and
soft-collinear modes in the jet thrust cross section. We also observe here that
the in-jet soft modes measured with thrust are actually the ""csoft"" modes of
the theory SCET$_+$. We dub the new theory with both csoft and soft-collinear
modes SCET$_{++}$. We go on to explain the relation between the ""unmeasured""
jet function appearing in total exclusive jet cross sections and the
hard-collinear and csoft functions in measured jet thrust cross sections. We do
not resum logs that are non-global in origin, arising from the ratio of the
scales of soft radiation whose thrust is measured at $Q\tau/R$ and of the
soft-collinear radiation at $2\Lambda R$. Their resummation would require the
introduction of additional operators beyond those we consider here. The steps
we outline here are a necessary part of summing logs of $R$ that are global in

for star formation and stellar and supermassive black hole feedback. The sample
is selected to capture the whole gamut of assembly histories that produce
clusters of similar final mass. We present an overview of the successes and
shortcomings of such simulations in reproducing both the stellar properties of
galaxies as well as properties of the hot plasma in clusters. In our
simulations, a long-lived cool-core/non-cool core dichotomy arises naturally,
and the emergence of non-cool cores is related to low angular momentum major
mergers. Nevertheless, the cool-core clusters exhibit a low central entropy
compared to observations, which cannot be alleviated by thermal AGN feedback.
For cluster scaling relations we find that the simulations match well the
$M_{500}-Y_{500}$ scaling of Planck SZ clusters but deviate somewhat from the
observed X-ray luminosity and temperature scaling relations in the sense of
being slightly too bright and too cool at fixed mass, respectively. Stars are
produced at an efficiency consistent with abundance matching constraints and
central galaxies have star formation rates consistent with recent observations.
While our simulations thus match various key properties remarkably well, we
conclude that the shortcomings strongly suggest an important role for
non-thermal processes (through feedback or otherwise) or thermal conduction in
shaping the intra-cluster medium.

varying depth, point spread function (PSF) size, and extinction on the galaxy
selection and correlation in photometric, multi-epoch, wide area surveys. We
take the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) as an
example. Variations in galaxy selection due to systematics are found to cause
density fluctuations of up to 10% for some small fraction of the area for most
galaxy redshift slices and as much as 50% for some extreme cases of faint
high-redshift samples. This results in correlations of galaxies against survey
systematics of order $\sim$1% when averaged over the survey area. We present an
empirical method for mitigating these systematic correlations from measurements
of angular correlation functions using weighted random points. These weighted
random catalogs are estimated from the observed galaxy over densities by
mapping these to survey parameters. We are able to model and mitigate the
effect of systematic correlations allowing for non-linear dependencies of
density on systematics. Applied to CFHTLenS we find that the method reduces
spurious correlations in the data by a factor two for most galaxy samples and
as much as an order of magnitude in others. Such a treatment is particularly
important for an unbiased estimation of very small correlation signals, as e.g.
from weak gravitational lensing magnification bias. We impose a criterion for
using a galaxy sample in a magnification measurement of the majority of the
systematic correlations show improvement and are less than 10% of the expected
magnification signal when combined in the galaxy cross correlation. After
correction the galaxy samples in CFHTLenS satisfy this criterion for $z_{\rm
phot}<0.9$ and will be used in a future analysis of magnification.

characterize double-peaked narrow emission-line galaxies based on optical

galaxies: J1023+3243, J1158+3231, and J1623+0808. The two radio sources are
spatially coincident with the two optical components of ionized gas with
AGN-like line ratios, which confirms the presence of dual AGNs in these three

radio-jet driven outflows, and one rotating narrow-line region. The remaining

source of cosmological information in recent years. Accurate covariance
estimates are an essential step for the validation of galaxy clustering models
of the redshift-space two-point statistics. Usually, only a limited set of
accurate N-body simulations is available. Thus, assessing the data covariance
is not possible or only leads to a noisy estimate. Further, relying on
simulated realisations of the survey data means that tests of the cosmology
dependence of the covariance are expensive. With these points in mind, this
work presents a simple theoretical model for the linear covariance of
anisotropic galaxy clustering observations with synthetic catalogues.
Considering the Legendre moments (`multipoles') of the two-point statistics and
projections into wide bins of the line-of-sight parameter (`clustering
wedges'), we describe the modelling of the covariance for these anisotropic
clustering measurements for galaxy samples with a trivial geometry in the case
of a Gaussian approximation of the clustering likelihood. As main result of
this paper, we give the explicit formulae for Fourier and configuration space
covariance matrices. To validate our model, we create synthetic HOD galaxy
catalogues by populating the haloes of an ensemble of large-volume N-body
simulations. Using linear and non-linear input power spectra, we find very good
agreement between the model predictions and the measurements on the synthetic
catalogues in the quasi-linear regime.

longitude and 10 deg in latitude. The Poisson significance of the detection is
at least 9 sigma. The stellar population in the overdense region is similar in
brightness and color to that of the nearby globular cluster NGC 1261,
indicating that the heliocentric distance of EriPhe is about d~16 kpc. The
extent of EriPhe in projection is therefore at least ~4 kpc by ~3 kpc. On the

discovered by DES at a similar heliocentric distance, the so-called Phoenix
Stream. Given their similar distance and proximity to each other, it is
possible that these three structures may be kinematically associated.
Alternatively, the EriPhe overdensity is morphologically similar to the Virgo
overdensity and the Hercules-Aquila cloud, which also lie at a similar
Galactocentric distance. These three overdensities lie along a polar plane

contrast, and provide new statistical constraints on the degree to which
Transition Objects and low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs)
are powered by an accreting black hole at <10 pc. We show that while the
small-aperture observations clearly resolve the nebular emission, the aperture
dependence in the line ratios is generally weak, and this can be explained by
gradients in the density of the line-emitting gas: the higher densities in the
more nuclear regions potentially flatten the excitation gradients, suppressing
the forbidden emission. The Transition Objects show a threefold increase in the
incidence of broad H_alpha emission in the high-resolution data, as well as the
strongest density gradients, supporting the composite model for these systems
as accreting sources surrounded by star-forming activity. The narrow-line
LINERs appear to be the weaker counterparts of the Type 1 LINERs, where the low
accretion rates cause the disappearance of the broad-line component. The
enhanced sensitivity of the HST observations reveals a 30% increase in the
incidence of accretion-powered systems at z~0. A comparison of the strength of
the broad-line emission detected at different epochs implies potential
broad-line variability on a decade-long timescale, with at least a factor of
three in amplitude.

with a short rest-frame optical period of 4 years. If the orbital period
matches this value, then for the range of estimated black hole masses the
components would be separated by 0.007-0.017 pc, implying relativistic orbital
speeds. There has been much debate over whether black hole orbits could be
smaller than 1 pc. Here we show that the amplitude and the sinusoid-like shape

of emission from a compact, steadily accreting, unequal-mass binary. We predict
that brightness variations in the ultraviolet light curve track those in the

insensitive to the details of the emission process, and is consistent with

aiming at achieving high spectral efficiency by deploying a large number of
base station (BS) antennas using coherent combining. Channel aging due to user
mobility is a significant degrading factor of such systems. In addition, cost
efficiency of massive MIMO is a prerecuisite for their deployment, that leads
to low cost antenna elements inducing high phase noise. Since phase is
time-dependent, it contributes to channel aging. For this reason, we present a
novel joint channel-phase noise model, that enables us to study the downlink of
massive MIMO with maximum ratio transmission (MRT) precoder under these
conditions by means of the deterministic equivalent of the achievable sum-rate.
Among the noteworthy outcomes is that the degradation due to user mobility
dominates over the effect of phase noise. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the
joint effects of phase noise and user mobility do not degrade the power scaling

electrophysiological brain signals characterize the transition from wakefulness
towards unconsciousness. The common mechanism underlying these observations
remains unknown. In this study we arrive at a basic model, which explains these
empirical observations based on the theory of phase transitions in complex
systems. We studied the link between spatial and temporal correlations of
large-scale brain activity recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging
during wakefulness, propofol-induced sedation and loss of consciousness, as
well as during the subsequent recovery. We observed that during unconsciousness
activity in frontal and thalamic regions exhibited a reduction of long-range
temporal correlations and a departure of functional connectivity from the
underlying anatomical constraints. These changes in dynamics and
anatomy-function coupling were correlated across participants, suggesting that
temporal complexity and an efficient exploration of anatomical connectivity are
inter-related phenomena. A model of a system exhibiting a phase transition
reproduced our findings, as well as the diminished sensitivity of the cortex to
external perturbations during unconsciousness. This theoretical framework
unifies different empirical observations about brain activity during
unconsciousness and predicts that the principles we identified are universal
and independent of the causes behind loss of awareness.

regarding regulators and entanglement entropies in anomalous theories. We then
study the entanglement entropy of free chiral fermions and self-dual bosons and
show that in sufficiently symmetric situations this entanglement anomaly comes
from an imbalance in the flux of modes flowing through the boundary, controlled
by familiar index theorems. In two and four dimensions we use anomalous Ward
identities to find general expressions for the transformation of the
entanglement entropy under a diffeomorphism. (In the case of a mixed anomaly
there is an alternative presentation of the theory in which the entanglement
entropy is not invariant under a U(1) gauge transformation. The free-field

a gravitational background with a twist in the normal bundle to the entangling

the average, performance of bipartite probes in local estimation tasks, which
was instead determined by quantum correlations other than entanglement. We
provide explicit prescriptions to characterize the most reliable states
maximizing the average skew information, and elucidate the role of state
purity, separability and correlations in the classification of optimal probes.

Keck/MOSFIRE. We find no gradient in the strength of the Balmer absorption

emission in [NII] broadly traces the spatial distribution of the stars and is
coupled with weak Halpha emission (log [NII]/Halpha = 0.6+-0.2), indicating
that OB stars are not the primary ionizing source. The velocity dispersion
within the effective radius is sigma_e = 271+-41 km/s. We detect rotation in
the stellar absorption lines for the first time beyond z~1. Using a
two-integral Jeans model that accounts for observational effects, we measure a
dynamical mass of log M_dyn =11.24+-0.14 and V/sigma=0.70+-0.21. This is a high
degree of rotation considering the modest observed ellipticity of 0.12+-0.08,
but it is consistent with predictions from dissipational merger simulations
that produce compact remnants. The mass of RG1M0150 implies that it is likely
to become a slowly rotating elliptical. If it is typical, this suggests that
the progenitors of massive ellipticals retain significant net angular momentum

dimensionality reduction first before learning the distance metric. The main
shortcoming of this approach is that it may result in a suboptimal solution due
to the subspace removed by the dimensionality reduction method. In this work,
we present a dual random projection frame for DML with high dimensional data
that explicitly addresses the limitation of dimensionality reduction for DML.
The key idea is to first project all the data points into a low dimensional
space by random projection, and compute the dual variables using the projected
vectors. It then reconstructs the distance metric in the original space using
the estimated dual variables. The proposed method, on one hand, enjoys the
light computation of random projection, and on the other hand, alleviates the
limitation of most dimensionality reduction methods. We verify both empirically

even if they are subject to limited removal of elementary building blocks, as
it may occur for random failures or targeted attacks. Here, we study how the
structure of these graphs is affected when nodes get removed successively until
an extensive fraction is removed such that the graphs fragment. We study
different types of proximity graphs for various node removal strategies. We use
different types of observables to monitor the fragmentation process, simple
ones like number and sizes of connected components, and more complex ones like
the hop diameter and the backup capacity, which is needed to make a network N-1
resilient. The actual fragmentation turns out to be described by a second order
phase transition. Using finite-size scaling analyses we numerically assess the
threshold fraction of removed nodes, which is characteristic for the particular
graph type and node deletion scheme, that suffices to decompose the underlying

conductivity compared to amorphous bulk polymers due to effective heat

unexplored as thermal transport has been studied in relatively few polymers.
Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study heat transport in
polynorbornene, a polymer that can be synthesized in semi-crystalline form
using solution processing. We find that even perfectly crystalline
polynorbornene has an exceptionally low thermal conductivity near the amorphous
limit due to extremely strong anharmonic scattering. Our calculations show that
this scattering is sufficiently strong to prevent the formation of propagating
phonons, with heat being instead carried by non-propagating, delocalized
vibrational modes known as diffusons. Our results demonstrate a mechanism for
achieving intrinsically low thermal conductivity even in crystalline polymers

a first contact. In low power ad-hoc networks, radios are duty-cycled and the
latency until a packet meets a reception phase of another device is determined
by a random process. Most research considers slotted protocols, in which the
points in time for reception are temporally coupled to beacon transmissions. In
contrast, many recent protocols, such as ANT/ANT+ and Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) use a slotless, periodic-interval based scheme for neighbor discovery.
Here, one device periodically broadcasts packets, whereas the other device
periodically listens to the channel. Both periods are independent from each
other and drawn over continuous time. Such protocols provide 3 degrees of
freedom (viz., the intervals for advertising and scanning and the duration of
each scan phase). Though billions of existing BLE devices rely on these
protocols, neither their expected latencies nor beneficial configurations with
good latency-duty-cycle relations are known. Parametrizations for the
participating devices are usually determined based on a ""good guess"". In this
paper, we for the first time present a mathematical theory which can compute
the neighbor discovery latencies for all possible parametrizations. Further,
our theory shows that upper bounds on the latency can be guaranteed for all
parametrizations, except for a finite number of singularities. Therefore,
slotless, periodic interval-based protocols can be used in applications with
deterministic latency demands, which have been reserved for slotted protocols
until now. Our proposed theory can be used for analyzing the neighbor discovery
latencies, for tweaking protocol parameters and for developing new protocols.

magnetohydrodynamics (SPM) in a strongly magnetized medium by using linear
analysis. In modern SPM, a correction term proportional to the divergence of
the magnetic fields is subtracted from the equation of motion to avoid a
numerical instability arising in a strongly magnetized medium. From the linear
analysis, it is found that SPM with the correction term suffer from significant
dispersive errors, especially for slow waves propagating along magnetic fields.
The phase velocity for all wave numbers is significantly larger than the exact
solution and has a peak at a finite wavenumber. These excessively large
dispersive errors occur because magnetic fields contribute an unphysical
repulsive force along magnetic fields. The dispersive errors cannot be reduced,
even with a larger smoothing length and smoother kernel functions such as the
Gaussian or quintic spline kernels. We perform the linear analysis for this
problem and find that the dispersive errors can be removed completely while
keeping SPM stable if the correction term is reduced by half. These findings
are confirmed by several simple numerical experiments.

binary operation of concatenation. Casually speaking, a free word is a finite
string of letters. Henceforth, we simply refer to them as words. Motivated by
recent advances in the combinatorial limit theory of graphs-notably those
involving flag algebras, graph homomorphisms, and graphons-we investigate the
extremal and asymptotic theory of pattern containment and avoidance in words.
Word V is a factor of word W provided V occurs as consecutive letters within W.
W is an instance of V provided there exists a nonerasing monoid homomorphsism
{\phi} with {\phi}(V) = W. For example, using the homomorphism {\phi} defined
by {\phi}(P) = Ror, {\phi}(h) = a, and {\phi}(D) = baugh, we see that Rorabaugh
is an instance of PhD.
  W avoids V if no factor of W is an instance of V. V is unavoidable provided,
over any finite alphabet, there are only finitely many words that avoid V.
Unavoidable words were classified by Bean, Ehrenfeucht, and McNulty (1979) and
Zimin (1982). We briefly address the following Ramsey-theoretic question: For
unavoidable word V and a fixed alphabet, what is the longest a word can be that
avoids V? The density of V in W is the proportion of nonempty substrings of W
that are instances of V. Since there are 45 substrings in Rorabaugh and 28 of
them are instances of PhD, the density of PhD in Rorabaugh is 28/45. We
establish a number of asymptotic results for word densities, including the
expected density of a word in arbitrarily long, random words and the minimum
density of an unavoidable word over arbitrarily long words.

replacing $\sigma^2 \textrm{Tr} (\mathbf{A}^*_\mathcal{I}

structured signals or data is of central importance in compressed sensing,

norm minimization are well understood through recent years' research. However,
rigorously characterizing the phase transition of total variation (TV)

we fully characterize the phase transition curve of the TV minimization. Our

linkage between the minmax Mean Square Error of a denoising problem and the

the spin order derived from the neutron diffraction refinements and the

addressed. In this work, detailed neutron diffraction measurements as a

neighborhood of the magnetic transition this configuration evolves into a
canted super-structure. The deduced temperature dependence of the canting angle
exhibits two closely spaced peaks, which are in excellent agreement with the
double peaks in the magnetic contribution to the specific heat and in the

reorientation of the net ferromagnetic moment of the noncollinear spin state,
due to the local breaking of the inversion symmetry promoted by the monoclinic
distortions, with structural changes acting as the driving force.

reaches a highest value of 33 K at x=0.35 around a quantum critical point at

transition disappears at x=0.6 where the AFM spin fluctuations (SFs) are no

suggesting that some inhomogeneity and/or imperfection for the latter increases
RDOS as expected for unconventional SC state with nodal gap. These findings in

effectively separates the fast intramodular from the slow intermodular dynamics
of perturbation spreading (in this respect, it is a generalization of the
'Markov stability' method of network community detection). Our approach
captures variation of modular organization across different system states, time
scales, and in response to different kinds of perturbations: aspects of
modularity which are all relevant to real-world dynamical systems. It offers a
principled alternative to detecting communities in networks of statistical
dependencies between system variables (e.g., 'relevance networks' or
'functional networks'). Using coupled logistic maps, we demonstrate that the
method uncovers hierarchical modular organization planted in a system's
coupling matrix. Additionally, in homogeneously-coupled map lattices, it
identifies the presence of self-organized modularity that depends on the
initial state, dynamical parameters, and type of perturbations. Our approach
offers a powerful tool for exploring the modular organization of complex

its active galactic nucleus (AGN) and its obscuring material. We use new mid-IR

($\lambda_{C}=8.7\, \mu$m) and $7.5-13$ $\mu$m spectroscopy taken with
CanariCam (CC) on the 10.4m Gran Telescopio CANARIAS. We also use archival
HST/NICMOS and Subaru/COMICS imaging and Spitzer/IRS spectroscopy. We estimate
the near- and mid-IR unresolved nuclear emission by modelling the imaging data
with GALFIT. We decompose the Spitzer/IRS and CC spectra using a power-law
component, which represents the emission due to dust heated by the AGN, and a
starburst component, both affected by foreground extinction. We model the
resulting unresolved near- and mid-IR, and the starburst subtracted CC spectrum
with the CLUMPY torus models of Nenkova et al. The derived geometrical
properties of the torus, including the large covering factor and the high
foreground extinction needed to reproduce the deep $9.7\, \mu$m silicate
feature, are consistent with the lack of strong AGN signatures in the optical.
We derive an AGN bolometric luminosity $L_{bol}\sim1.9\times10^{45}\,$erg
s$^{-1}$ that is in good agreement with other estimates in the literature.

  1917-1925, 2014",,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the matrix completion problem of recovering a structured matrix
from noisy and partial measurements. Recent works have proposed tractable
estimators with strong statistical guarantees for the case where the underlying
matrix is low--rank, and the measurements consist of a subset, either of the
exact individual entries, or of the entries perturbed by additive Gaussian
noise, which is thus implicitly suited for thin--tailed continuous data.
Arguably, common applications of matrix completion require estimators for (a)
heterogeneous data--types, such as skewed--continuous, count, binary, etc., (b)
for heterogeneous noise models (beyond Gaussian), which capture varied
uncertainty in the measurements, and (c) heterogeneous structural constraints
beyond low--rank, such as block--sparsity, or a superposition structure of
low--rank plus elementwise sparseness, among others. In this paper, we provide
a vastly unified framework for generalized matrix completion by considering a
matrix completion setting wherein the matrix entries are sampled from any
member of the rich family of exponential family distributions; and impose
general structural constraints on the underlying matrix, as captured by a
general regularizer $\mathcal{R}(.)$. We propose a simple convex regularized
$M$--estimator for the generalized framework, and provide a unified and novel
statistical analysis for this general class of estimators. We finally
corroborate our theoretical results on simulated datasets.

Finally, we show how such word cloud visualizations provide an intuitive

three-body potentials are obtained from the fit to total energies and atomic
forces computed with the van der Waals density functional theory method due to
Grimme, and represent an improvement with respect to previously reported
three-body interaction models. In particular, we show that some of the
introduced BM parametrizations reproduce closely the experimental equation of
state and bulk modulus of solid helium up to a pressure of ~ 60 GPa, when used
in combination with standard pairwise interaction models in diffusion Monte
Carlo simulations. Importantly, we find that recent predictions reporting a
surprisingly small variation of the kinetic energy and Lindeman ratio on
quantum crystals under increasing pressure are likely to be artifacts produced
by the use of incomplete interaction models. Also, we show that the
experimental variation of the shear modulus, C44, at P < 25 GPa can be
quantitatively described with the new set of three-body BM potentials. At
higher pressures, however, the agreement between our C44 results and

better describe elasticity in very dense solid 4He.

energy spectra by the electron-hole exchange interaction is explicitly
considered. For the valley depolarization dynamics, in the monolayer MoS$_2$,
it is found that in the strong scattering regime, the conventional motional
narrowing picture is no longer valid, and a novel valley depolarization channel
is opened. For the valley Hall effect of exciton, in both the mono- and bilayer
MoS$_2$, with the exciton equally pumped in the K and K' valleys, the system
can evolve into the equilibrium state where the valley polarization is parallel
to the effective magnetic field due to the exchange interaction. With the drift
of this equilibrium state by applied uniaxial strain, the exchange interaction
can induce the {\it momentum-dependent} valley/photoluminesence polarization,
which leads to the valley/photoluminesence Hall current. Specifically, the
disorder strength dependence of the valley Hall conductivity is revealed. In
the strong scattering regime, the valley Hall conductivity decreases with the
increase of the disorder strength; whereas in the weak scattering regime, it
saturates to a constant, which can be much larger than the one in Fermi system
due to the absence of the Pauli blocking.

planning institutions worldwide. A growing evidence base indicates that high
quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure
and other cycling measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the
right places, such as along 'desire lines' of high latent demand. This creates
the need for tools and methods to help answer the question 'where to build?'.
Following a brief review of the policy and research context related to this
question, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications
of such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive
planning support system which was initially developed to explore and map
cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on
origin-destination data, it models and visualises cycling levels at area,
desire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and
for scenario-based 'cycling futures'. Four scenarios are presented, including
'Go Dutch' and 'Ebikes', which explore what would happen if English people
cycled as much as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on
cycling uptake. The cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the
number of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and
carbon benefits. The PCT reports these at area, desire line, and route level
for each scenario. The PCT is open source, facilitating the creation of
additional scenarios and its deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the
PCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and
raises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.

large-scale structures, voids. Our void galaxy sample (75,939 galaxies) is
selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) with
$\rm z < 0.107$. We find that there are no significant differences in the
luminosities, stellar masses, stellar populations, and specific star formation
rates between void galaxies of specific spectral types and their wall
counterparts. However, the fraction of star-forming galaxies in voids is
significantly higher ($\ge 9\%$) than that in walls. Void galaxies, when
considering all spectral types, are slightly fainter, less massive, have
younger stellar populations and of higher specific star formation rates than
wall galaxies. These minor differences are totally caused by the higher
fraction of star-forming galaxies in voids. We confirm that AGNs exist in
voids, already found by \cite{co08}, with similar abundance as in walls. Type I
AGNs contribute $\sim$ 1\%-2\% of void galaxies, similar to their fraction in
walls. The intrinsic [O III] luminosities , spanning over $10^6\ L_{\sun} \sim
10^9\ L_{\sun}$, and Eddington ratios are similar comparing our void AGNs
versus wall AGNs. Small scale statistics show that all spectral types of void
galaxies are less clustered than their counterparts in walls. Major merger may
not be the dominant trigger of black hole accretion in the luminosity range we
probe. Our study implies that the growth of black holes relies weakly on large

path-length distance to both $x$ and $C$. The linear span of the characteristic
vectors corresponding to the cells in this partition has an irreducible module
structure for the universal double affine Hecke algebra $\hat{H}_q$ of type
$(C^{\vee}_1, C_1)$. From this module, we naturally obtain a finite sequence of
orthogonal Laurent polynomials. We prove the orthogonality relations for these

Changing $\hat{H}_q$ by $\hat{H}_{q^{-1}}$ we show how our Laurent polynomials

interpreted as resulting from an aggregation process of smaller-scale
structures. Here, we explore the alternative possibility that such large-scale
motions are themselves self-sustained and do not draw their energy from
smaller-scale turbulent motions activated in buffer layers. To this end, it is
first shown that large-scale motions in turbulent Couette flow at Re=2150
self-sustain even when active processes at smaller scales are artificially
quenched by increasing the Smagorinsky constant Cs in large eddy simulations.
These results are in agreement with earlier results on pressure driven
turbulent channels. We further investigate the nature of the large-scale
coherent motions by computing upper and lower-branch nonlinear steady solutions
of the filtered (LES) equations with a Newton-Krylov solver,and find that they
are connected by a saddle-node bifurcation at large values of Cs. Upper branch
solutions for the filtered large scale motions are computed for Reynolds
numbers up to Re=2187 using specific paths in the Re-Cs parameter plane and
compared to large-scale coherent motions. Continuation to Cs = 0 reveals that
these large-scale steady solutions of the filtered equations are connected to
the Nagata-Clever-Busse-Waleffe branch of steady solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations. In contrast, we find it impossible to connect the latter to buffer
layer motions through a continuation to higher Reynolds numbers in minimal flow
units.

blindness is on the increase. This is a significant global problem. The most
common symptoms of cataracts are glared and blurred vision. Usually, people
with cataract have trouble seeing or reading at distance or in low light and
also their color perception is altered. Furthermore, cataract is a sneaky
disease as it is usually a very slow but progressive process, which creates
adaptation so that patients find it difficult to recognize. Moreover, for the
doctors it can be very difficult to explain and give comprehensive answers to
the patients' symptoms. We built and tested an optic device that uses egg
albumen to mimic the optical degradation of the crystalline related cataracts
and that is able to visualize how the cataract impairs vision. At best of our
knowledge, it is the first experimental system developed at this aim. This can
be a valuable tool, which can be of help in education for students in medical
sciences as well as to provide a method to illustrate the patients how their
vision is affected by cataract progression process.

Bayesian formulation in which the posterior is a functional that ranks
different configuration space distributions. By maximizing this posterior, we
derive an optimal Bayesian ensemble distribution. For discrete configurations,
this optimal distribution is identical to that obtained by the maximum entropy

refinement enhances the sampling of relevant configurations by imposing

accelerate the convergence. An adaptive algorithm can be used to sample

mapping, particularly in poor resource settings where uniformly precise mapping
may be unrealistically costly and priority is often to identify critical areas
where interventions can have the most health impact. Two constructions are:
$singleton$ and $batch$ adaptive sampling. In singleton sampling, locations
$x_i$ are chosen sequentially and at each stage, $x_{k+1}$ depends on data
obtained at locations $x_1,\ldots , x_k$. In batch sampling, locations are
chosen in batches of size $b > 1$, allowing new batch, $\{x_{(k+1)},\ldots

most settings, batch sampling is more realistic than singleton sampling. We

real-space structures are associated with entangled correlations amongst the
phase precession frequencies and the amplitude evolution of Fourier triads. As
a result, triad precession frequencies show a non-Gaussian distribution with
multiple peaks and fat tails, and there is a significant correlation between
triad precession frequencies and amplitude growth. Links with dynamical systems
approach are briefly discussed, such as the role of unstable critical points in
state space. On the other hand, by reducing the fractal dimension $D$ of the
underlying Fourier set, we observe: i) a tendency toward a more Gaussian
statistics, ii) a loss of alignment of triad phases leading to a depletion of

investigated a natural iron sulfide based materials (Troilite) inclusion with
its associated minerals in the iron meteorite Tlacotepec. Tlacotepec formed in
an asteroidal core under high pressure and at high temperature over millions of
years, while insoluble sulfur rich materials segregated into inclusions during
cooling along with included minerals. The search for superconductivity in these
heterogeneous materials requires a technique capable of detecting minute
amounts of a superconducting phase embedded in a non-superconducting matrix. We
used Magnetic Field Modulated Microwave Spectroscopy (MFMMS), a very sensitive,
selective, and non-destructive technique, to search for superconductivity in
heterogeneous systems. Here, we report the observation of an electro-magnetic
phase transition at 117 K that causes a MFMMS-response typical of a
superconductor. A pronounced and reproducible peak together with isothermal
magnetic field sweeps prove the appearance of a new electromagnetic phase below

in a granular superconductor with a short coherence length. Although the
compound responsible for the peak in the MFMMS-spectra was not identified, it
is possibly an iron sulfide based phase, or another material heterogeneously

(HHG) with exploring a wide laser-parameter region theoretically. Previous
studies have showed that for high laser intensities near to the saturation
ionization intensity, the HHG inversion efficiency is higher for shorter pulses
since the ground-state depletion is weaker in the latter. Surprisingly, our
simulations show this high efficiency also appears even for a moderate laser
intensity at which the ionization is not strong. A classical effect relating to
shorter travel distances of the rescattering electron in shorter pulses, is
found to contribute importantly to this high efficiency. The effect can be
amplified significantly as a two-color laser field is used, suggesting an
effective approach for increasing the HHG yield.

$\sim$ 2 TeV in $\sim$ 13.1 h livetime. The observations comprise low flux
states and strong flaring events, which in 2014 show a flux level comparable to
the 1997 historical maximum. Such high flux states enable spectral variability
and flux variability studies down to a timescale of four minutes in the 2-20
TeV energy range. During the 2014 flare, the source is clearly detected in each
of these bins. The intrinsic spectrum is well described by a power law of index
$\Gamma=2.15\pm0.06$ and does not show curvature in this energy range. Flux
dependent spectral analyses show a clear harder-when-brighter behaviour. The
high flux levels and the high sensitivity of H.E.S.S. allow studies in the
unprecedented combination of short timescales and an energy coverage that

increasing number of elements in a system. It is rather easy to calculate the
interdiffusion coefficients for all the compositions in the interdiffusion zone
in a binary system. The intrinsic diffusion coefficients can be calculated for
the composition of Kirkendall marker plane in a binary system. In a ternary
system, however, the interdiffusion coefficients can only be calculated for the
composition where composition profiles from two different diffusion couples
intersect. Intrinsic diffusion coefficients are possible to calculate when the
Kirkendall markers are also present at that composition, which is a condition
that is generally difficult to satisfy. In a quaternary system, the composition
profiles for three different diffusion couples must intersect at one particular
composition to calculate the diffusion parameters, which is a condition that is
almost impossible to satisfy. To avoid these complications in a multicomponent
system, the average interdiffusion coefficients are calculated. I propose a
method of calculating the intrinsic diffusion coefficients and the variation in
the interdiffusion coefficients for multicomponent systems. This method can be
used for a single diffusion couple in a multicomponent pseudobinary system. The
compositions of the end members of a diffusion couple should be selected such
that only two elements diffuse into the interdiffusion zone. A few hypothetical
diffusion couples are considered in order to validate and explain our method.

In the magnetically ordered system, the magnetization displays a sudden drop as
function of impurity density or magnetic moment amplitude. The drop occurs as
the spin-polarized impurity band crosses the Fermi level and is associated with
a quantum phase transition first put forward by Sakurai for the single impurity
case. Taking into account that the background magnetic field created by the

typically expressed by the Band function: smooth joining of two power-law
functions for high-energy and low-energy regions. To reveal the origin of the
Band function, we revisit the stochastic acceleration model, in which electrons
are accelerated via scattering with turbulent waves in the GRB outflow. The
balance between the acceleration and synchrotron cooling yields a narrow
energy-distribution similar to the Maxwellian distribution. The synchrotron
spectrum becomes consistent with the observed hard photon index for the
low-energy region. On the other hand, the narrow electron energy distribution
contradicts the power-law spectrum for the high-energy region. We consider an
evolution of the electron energy distribution to solve this problem. The
turbulence and magnetic field induced by a certain hydrodynamical instability
gradually decay. According to this evolution, the typical synchrotron photon
energy also decreases with time. The time-integrated spectrum forms the
power-law shape for the high-energy region. We discuss the required evolutions
of the turbulence and magnetic field to produce a typical Band function.
Although the decay of the turbulence is highly uncertain, recent numerical
simulations for decaying turbulence seem comparatively positive for the
stochastic acceleration model. Another condition required to reconcile
observations is a much shorter duration of the stochastic acceleration than the
dynamical timescale.

difference in mobility between the electrons and the ions creates a nonneutral
layer known as the Debye sheath (DS). However, in magnetic fusion devices, the
open magnetic field lines intersect the structural elements of the device with
near grazing incidence angles. The magnetic field tends to align the particle
flow along its own field lines, thus counteracting the mechanism that leads to
the formation of the DS. Recent work using a fluid model [P. Stangeby, Nucl.
Fusion {\bf 52}, 083012 (2012)] showed that the DS disappears when the
incidence angle is smaller than a critical value (around $5^\circ$ for
ITER-like parameters). Here, we study this transition by means of numerical
simulations of a kinetic model both in the collisionless and weakly collisional
regimes. We show that the main features observed in the fluid model are
preserved: for grazing incidence, the space charge density near the wall is
reduced, the ion flow is subsonic, and the electric field and plasma density
profiles are spread out over several ion Larmor radii instead of a few Debye
lengths as in the unmagnetized case. As there is no singularity at the DS
entrance in the kinetic model, this phenomenon depends smoothly on the magnetic
field incidence angle and no particular critical angle arises. The simulation
results and the predictions of the fluid model are in good agreement, although
some discrepancies subsist, mainly due to the assumptions of isothermal closure
and diagonality of the pressure tensor in the fluid model.

$f':\mathbb{T}\to [0,1]$ such that the averages of $f$ and $f'$ across any
prescribed system of linear forms of complexity 1 differ by at most $\epsilon$.
This result follows from work of Sisask, building on Fourier-analytic arguments
of Croot that answered a question of Green. We generalize this result to
systems of complexity at most 2, replacing $\mathbb{T}$ with the torus
$\mathbb{T}^2$ equipped with a specific filtration. To this end we use a notion
of modelling for filtered nilmanifolds, that we define in terms of
equidistributed maps, and we combine this with tools of quadratic Fourier
analysis. Our results yield expressions on the torus for limits of
combinatorial quantities involving systems of complexity 2 on $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
For instance, let $m_4(\alpha,\mathbb{Z}_p)$ denote the minimum, over all sets
$A\subset \mathbb{Z}_p$ of cardinality at least $\alpha p$, of the density of
4-term arithmetic progressions inside $A$. We show that $\lim_{p\to \infty}

dependence on F. Equilibrium rates extrapolated by NE-AIMD results are in
excellent agreement with those of unconstrained dynamics. The gain in
computational efficiency achieved with our approach increases rapidly with
decreasing temperatures, and reaches a factor of four orders of magnitude at

to close the problem. One of the most popular models is that proposed by

work, we consider the coding variant Perpetual codes which are sparse,
non-uniform and the coding vectors have a compact representation. The sparsity
allows for fast encoding and decoding, and the non-uniform protection of
symbols enables recoding where the produced symbols are indistinguishable from
those encoded at the source. The presented results show that the approach can
provide a coding overhead arbitrarily close to that of RLNC, but at reduced
computational load. The achieved gain over RLNC grows with the generation size,
and both encoding and decoding throughput is approximately one order of

the approach allows for easy adjustment between coding throughput and code
overhead, which makes it suitable for a broad range of platforms and

remaining core collapse events of which 44% type II, 22% type IIn and 34% type
Ib/c. In order to link the transients, we built a catalog of ~1.3x10^5 galaxies
in the redshift range 0<z<1 with a limiting magnitude K_AB=23.5 mag. We
measured the SN rate per unit volume for SN Ia and core collapse SNe in
different bin of redshifts. The values are consistent with other measurements
from the literature. The dispersion of the rate measurements for SNe Ia is
comparable with the scatter of the theoretical tracks for single (SD) and
double degenerate (DD) binary systems models, therefore the data do not allow
to disentangle among the two different progenitor scenarios. However, we may
notice that among the three tested models, SD and two flavours of DD, either
with a steep (DDC) or a wide (DDW) delay time distribution, the SD gives a
better fit across the whole redshift range whereas the DDC better matches the
steep rise up to redshift ~1.2. The DDW appears instead less favoured. The core
collapse SN rate is fully consistent, unlike recent claims, with the prediction
based on recent estimates of the star formation history, and standard
progenitor mass range.

micro-membrane placed inside a Fabry-Perot optical cavity. By monitoring the
cavity characteristic frequencies it is possible to detect the tiny membrane
displacements caused by an applied force. Far from the mechanical resonant
frequency of the membrane, the measured force sensitivity is 5.0e-14
N/sqrt(Hz), corresponding to a displacement sensitivity of 2.5e-15 m/sqrt(Hz),
while near resonance the sensitivity is 1.5e-14 N/sqrt(Hz), reaching the
estimated thermal limit, or, in terms of displacement, 7.5e-16 N/sqrt(Hz).
These displacement sensitivities are comparable to those that can be achieved
by large interferometric gravitational wave detectors.

in solid state physics to approximate the ground state of one-dimensional spin
chains. In this paper, we study homogeneous MPS (hMPS), or MPS constructed via
site-independent tensors and a boundary condition. Exploiting a connection with
the theory of matrix algebras, we derive two structural properties shared by
all hMPS, namely: a) there exist local operators which annihilate all hMPS of a
given bond dimension; and b) there exist local operators which, when applied
over any hMPS of a given bond dimension, decouple (cut) the particles where
they act from the spin chain while at the same time join (glue) the two loose
ends back again into a hMPS. Armed with these tools, we show how to
systematically derive `bond dimension witnesses', or 2-local operators whose
expectation value allows us to lower bound the bond dimension of the underlying
hMPS. We extend some of these results to the ansatz of Projected Entangled
Pairs States (PEPS). As a bonus, we use our insight on the structure of hMPS
to: a) derive some theoretical limitations on the use of hMPS and hPEPS for
ground state energy computations; b) show how to decrease the complexity and
boost the speed of convergence of the semidefinite programming hierarchies

magnetograms we study the spatial and temporal evolution of a set of loops in

  Results: We find a transient brightening of loops in emission from Fe xviii
forming at about 7.2 MK while at the same time these loops dim in emission from
lower temperatures. This points to a fast heating of the loop that goes along
with evaporation of material that we observe as apparent upward motions in the
image sequence. After this initial phases lasting for some 10 min, the loops
brighten in a sequence of AIA channels showing cooler and cooler plasma,
indicating the cooling of the loops over a time scale of about one hour. A
comparison to the predictions from a 1D loop model shows that this observation
supports the nanoflare process in (almost) all aspects. In addition, our
observations show that the loops get broader while getting brighter, which

already visited positions (to the rightmost visited site) with a probability
$r$, and with probability $(1-r)$, it undergoes symmetric random walk, i.e., it
hops to one of its neighboring sites, with equal probability $(1-r)/2$. For
$r=0$, it reduces to a standard random walk whose typical distance grows as
$\sqrt{n}$ for large $n$. In presence of a nonzero resetting rate $0<r\le 1$,
we find that both the average maximum and the average position grow
ballistically for large $n$, with a common speed $v(r)$. Moreover, the
fluctuations around their respective averages grow diffusively, again with the
same diffusion coefficient $D(r)$. We compute $v(r)$ and $D(r)$ explicitly. We
also show that the probability distribution of the difference between the
maximum and the location of the walker, becomes stationary as $n\to \infty$.
However, the approach to this stationary distribution is accompanied by a
dynamical phase transition, characterized by a weakly singular large deviation
function. We also show that $r=0$ is a special `critical' point, for which the
growth laws are different from the $r\to 0$ case and we calculate the exact
crossover functions that interpolate between the critical $(r=0)$ and the
off-critical $(r\to 0)$ behavior for finite but large $n$.

considered where both the goal function~$f(x)$ and its gradient $f'(x)$ are
black-box functions. It is supposed that $f'(x)$ satisfies the Lipschitz

of the Zn $3d$ orbitals are observed with ultraviolet incident light.
Measurements with soft x-rays clarify the host valence-band electronic
structure primarily composed of the As $4p$ states. Two hole pockets around the
$\Gamma$ point, a hole corrugated cylinder surrounding the $\Gamma$ and Z
points, and an electron pocket around the Z point are observed, and explain the
metallic transport of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$(Zn$_{1-y}$Mn$_{y}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$. This
is contrasted with Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As (GaMnAs), where it is located above the
As $4p$ valence-band maximum (VBM) and no Fermi surfaces have been clearly
identified. Resonance soft x-ray ARPES measurements reveal a nondispersive

case of GaMnAs. However, the impurity band is located well below the VBM,
unlike the impurity band in GaMnAs, which is located around and above the VBM.
We conclude that, while the strong hybridization between the Mn $3d$ and the As
$4p$ orbitals plays an important role in creating the impurity band and
inducing high temperature ferromagnetism in both systems, the metallic
transport may predominantly occur in the host valence band in
Ba$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$(Zn$_{1-y}$Mn$_{y}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and in the impurity band in
GaMnAs.

structure of magnetic fields in galaxies. Unpolarized synchrotron emission
traces isotropic turbulent fields which are strongest in spiral arms and bars
(20-30 \mu G) and in central starburst regions (50-100 \mu G). Such fields are
dynamically important; they affect gas flows and drive gas inflows in central
regions. -- Polarized emission traces ordered fields, which can be regular or
anisotropic turbulent, where the latter originates from isotropic turbulent
fields by the action of compression or shear. The strongest ordered fields
(10-15 \mu G) are generally found in interarm regions. In galaxies with strong
density waves, ordered fields are also observed at the inner edges of spiral
arms. Ordered fields with spiral patterns exist in grand-design, barred and
flocculent galaxies, and in central regions. Ordered fields in interacting
galaxies have asymmetric distributions and are a tracer of past interactions
between galaxies or with the intergalactic medium. In radio halos around
edge-on galaxies, ordered magnetic fields with X-shaped patterns are observed.
-- Faraday rotation measures of the diffuse polarized radio emission from
galaxy disks reveal large-scale spiral patterns that can be described by the
superposition of azimuthal modes; these are signatures of regular fields
generated by mean-field dynamos. ""Magnetic arms"" between gaseous spiral arms
may also be products of dynamo action, but need a stable spiral pattern to
develop. Helically twisted field loops winding around spiral arms were found in
two galaxies so far. Large-scale field reversals, like the one found in the
Milky Way, could not yet be detected in external galaxies. -- The origin and
evolution of cosmic magnetic fields will be studied with forthcoming radio

this material unless users know exactly where to look. Since the very
beginning, libraries have played a major role in supporting the OA movement.
Next to all services they can provide to support the deposit of research output
in the repositories, they can make Open Access materials widely discoverable by
their patrons through general search engines (Google, Bing...), specialized
search engines (like Google Scholar) and library discovery tools, thus
expanding their collection to include materials that they would not necessarily
pay for. In this paper, we intend to focus on two aspects regarding Open Access
and Primo discovery tool. In early 2013, Ex Libris Group started to add
institutional repositories to Primo Central Index (PCI), their mega-aggregation
of hundreds of millions of scholarly e-resources. After 2 years, it may be
interesting to take stock of the current situation of PCI regarding Open Access
institutional repositories. On basis of a survey to carry out among the Primo
community, the paper also shows how libraries using Primo discovery tool
integrate Green Open Access contents in their catalog. Two major ways are
possible for them: Firstly, they can directly harvest, index and manage any
repository in their Primo and display those free contents next to the more
traditional library collections; Secondly, if they are PCI subscribers, they
can quickly and easily activate any, if not all, of the Open Access
repositories contained PCI, making thus the contents of those directly
discoverable to their end users.

with the threshold value \epsilon chosen at or just above the percolation
threshold of the network are quite well understood, what happens as the
threshold increases beyond the usual operational window is still not clear from
a complex network perspective. The present Letter is focused mainly on the
network properties at intermediate-to-large values of the recurrence threshold,
for which no systematic study has been performed so far. We argue, with
numerical support, that recurrence networks constructed from chaotic attractors
with \epsilon equal to the usual recurrence threshold or slightly above cannot,
in general, show small-world property. However, if the threshold is further
increased, the recurrence network topology initially changes to a
small-worldstructure and finally to that of a classical random graph as the
threshold approaches the size of the strange attractor.

Instead of reflecting the position of the forward shock, it is then associated
with the expansion of the Rayleigh-Taylor unstable region emanating from the
contact discontinuity. Although observations imply a constant ratio between the
energy densities in magnetic fields and relativistic electrons, they do not

substantially increased. To attain scalability for large graphs, fast
graph-signal filtering techniques are needed. In this contribution, we propose
an accelerated algorithm based on the Lanczos method that adapts to the
Laplacian spectrum without explicitly computing it. The result is an accurate,
robust, scalable and efficient algorithm. Compared to existing methods based on
Chebyshev polynomials, our solution achieves higher accuracy without increasing
the overall complexity significantly. Furthermore, it is particularly well
suited for graphs with large spectral gaps.

Twisting is usually performed for one flavour and only in the valence, and this

restoring unitarity through the reweighting method. We first study some
properties of the approach at tree level and then we stochastically evaluate
ratios of fermionic determinants for different boundary conditions in order to
include them in the gauge averages, avoiding in this way the expensive
generation of new configurations for each choice of the twisting angle,
$\theta$. As expected the effect of reweighting is negligible in the case of
large volumes but it is important when the volumes are small and the twisting
angles are large. In particular we find a measurable effect for the plaquette
and the pion correlation function in the case of $\theta=\pi/2$ in a volume
$16\times 8^3$, and we observe a systematic upward shift in the pion dispersion
relation.

model complex, real-world strongly correlated materials. However, despite their

classical computers as soon as the number of particles exceeds a few tens. For
this reason, the quantum simulation of spin Hamiltonians using the tools of
atomic and molecular physics has become very active over the last years, using
ultracold atoms or molecules in optical lattices, or trapped ions. All of these
approaches have their own assets, but also limitations. Here, we report on a
novel platform for the study of spin systems, using individual atoms trapped in
two-dimensional arrays of optical microtraps with arbitrary geometries, where
filling fractions range from 60 to 100% with exact knowledge of the initial
configuration. When excited to Rydberg D-states, the atoms undergo strong
interactions whose anisotropic character opens exciting prospects for
simulating exotic matter. We illustrate the versatility of our system by
studying the dynamics of an Ising-like spin-1/2 system in a transverse field
with up to thirty spins, for a variety of geometries in one and two dimensions,
and for a wide range of interaction strengths. For geometries where the
anisotropy is expected to have small effects we find an excellent agreement
with ab-initio simulations of the spin-1/2 system, while for strongly
anisotropic situations the multilevel structure of the D-states has a
measurable influence. Our findings establish arrays of single Rydberg atoms as
a versatile platform for the study of quantum magnetism.

a star to measure the line broadening caused by the modulus of its average
surface magnetic field. The advantage of the autocorrelation comes from the
fact that it can detect very small spectral line broadening effects because it
averages over many spectral lines and therefore gives an average with a very
high signal to noise ratio. We validate the technique with the spectra of known
magnetic stars and obtain autocorrelation curves that are in full agreement
with published magnetic curves obtained with Zeeman splitting. The
autocorrelation also gives less noisy curves so that it can be used to obtain
very accurate curves. We degrade the resolution of spectra of these magnetic
stars to lower spectral resolutions where the Zeeman splitting is undetectable.
At these resolutions, the autocorrelation still gives good quality curves,
thereby showing that it can be used to measure magnetic fields in spectra where
the Zeeman splitting is significantly smaller than the width of the spectral
line. This would therefore allow observing magnetic fields in very faint Ap
stars with low-resolution spectrographs, thereby greatly increasing the number
of known magnetic stars. It also demonstrates that the autocorrelation can
measure magnetic fields in rapidly rotating stars as well as weak magnetic
fields that give a Zeeman splitting smaller than the intrinsic width of the
spectral lines. Finally, it shows that the autocorrelation can be used to find
unknown magnetic stars in low resolution spectroscopic surveys.

excitation density larger than a critical value. This allows us to identify the

population, we take full account of the vibrationally-resolved H_2^+ kinetics.
We find that in clouds under soft but intense radiation fields with spectral
temperature T_rad < 7000 K, the H_2^+ channel is the dominant H_2 formation
process. On the other hand, for harder spectra with T_rad > 7000 K, the H^-
channel takes over H_2^+ in the production of molecular hydrogen. We calculate
the critical radiation intensity needed for supermassive star formation by
direct collapse and examine its dependence on the H_2^+ level population. Under
the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) level population, the
critical intensity is underestimated by a factor of a few for soft spectra with
T_rad < 7000 K. For harder spectra, the value of the critical intensity is not
affected by the level population of H_2^+. This result justifies previous
estimates of the critical intensity assuming LTE populations since radiation

magnetic field generation from finite amplitude non-axisymmetric perturbations
by comparing numerical simulations with quasi-linear analytic theory. When
initiated with a vertical magnetic field of either zero or finite net flux, our
global cylindrical simulations exhibit the magnetorotational instability (MRI)
and large scale dynamo growth of radially alternating mean fields, averaged
over height and azimuth. This dynamo growth is explained by our analytic
calculations of a non-axisymmetric fluctuation-induced EMF that is sustained by
azimuthal shear of the fluctuating fields. The standard ""Omega effect"" (shear
of the mean field by differential rotation) is unimportant. For the MRI case,
we express the large-scale dynamo field as a function of differential rotation.
The resulting radially alternating large-scale fields may have implications for
angular momentum transport in disks and corona. To connect with previous work
on large scale dynamos with local linear shear and identify the minimum
conditions needed for large scale field growth, we also solve our equations in
local Cartesian coordinates. We find that large scale dynamo growth in a linear
shear flow without rotation can be sustained by shear plus non-axisymmetric
fluctuations -- even if not helical, a seemingly previously unidentified
distinction. The linear shear flow dynamo emerges as a more restricted version
of our more general new global cylindrical calculations.

that its nonlinearity can be tuned with an external magnetic flux and can even
change sign. This feature of the transmission line can be used to perform phase
matching in a degenerate four-wave mixing process which can be utilized for
parametric amplification of a weak signal in the presence of a strong pump.
Numerical simulations of the TWPA design have shown that with tuning, phase

design can realize: compact TWPAs with less than 211 unit cells, signal gains
greater than 20 dB, 3 dB bandwidth greater than 5.4 GHz, and saturation powers
up to -98 dBm. This amplifier design is well suited for multiplexed readout of

Laplacian prior assigned to the brain activity approximating an $\ell_{20}$
pseudo norm regularization in a Bayesian framework. A partially collapsed Gibbs
sampler is used to draw samples asymptotically distributed according to the
posterior associated with the proposed Bayesian model. The generated samples
are used to estimate the brain activity and the model hyperparameters jointly
in an unsupervised framework. Two different kinds of Metropolis-Hastings moves
are introduced to accelerate the convergence of the Gibbs sampler. The first
move is based on multiple dipole shifts within each MCMC chain whereas the
second one exploits proposals associated with different MCMC chains. We use
both synthetic and real data to compare the performance of the proposed method
with the weighted $\ell_{21}$ mixed norm regularization and a method based on a
multiple sparse prior, showing that our algorithm presents advantages in
several scenarios.

quite rich already in the case of the single-band model, including a molecular

relevant for these cases and discuss their symmetries and strong coupling

food security challenge to the agricultural industry in terms of dairy and meat
production. In GB, Scotland has had a risk based surveillance testing policy
under which high risk herds are tested frequently, and in Sept 2009 was
officially declared as TB free. Wales have had an annual or more frequent
testing policy for all cattle herds since Jan 2010, while in England several
herds are still tested every 4 years except some high TB prevalence areas where
annual testing is applied. Time series analysis using publicly available data
for total tests on herds, total cattle slaughtered, new herd incidents, and
herds not TB free, were analysed globally for GB and locally for the
constituent regions of Wales, Scotland, West, North, and East England. After
detecting trends over time, underlying regional differences were compared with
the testing policies in the region. Total cattle slaughtered are decreasing in
Wales, Scotland and West England, but increasing in the North and East English
regions. New herd incidents, i.e., disease incidence, are decreasing in Wales,
Scotland, West English region, but increasing in North and East English
regions. Herds not TB free, are increasing in West, North, and East English
regions, while they are decreasing in Wales and Scotland. Total cattle
slaughtered were positively correlated with total tests in the West, North, and
East English regions, with high slopes of regression. There was no correlation
between total cattle slaughtered and total tests on herds in Wales indicating
that herds are tested frequent enough in order to detect all likely cases and
so control TB. The main conclusion of the analysis conducted here is that more
frequent testing is leading to lower TB infections in cattle both in terms of
TB prevalence as well as TB incidence.

classical agent based models we find that they do not lead robustly to
schooling due to flow mediated interactions. In turn, we present dipole
swimmers equipped with adaptive decision-making that learn, through a
reinforcement learning algorithm, to adjust their gaits in response to
non-linearly varying hydrodynamic loads. The dipoles maintain their relative
position within a formation by adapting their strength and school in a variety
of prescribed geometrical arrangements. Furthermore, we identify schooling
patterns that minimize the individual and the collective swimming effort,
through an evolutionary optimization. The present work suggests that the
adaptive response of individual swimmers to flow-mediated interactions is
critical in fish schooling.

SBDA requires only a block of subgradients and updates blocks of variables and

introduce randomized stepsize rules and block sampling schemes that are

in experiments designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave
background on large angular scales because of their capability for providing
rapid, front-end polarization modulation and control over systematic errors.
Despite the advantages provided by the VPM, it is important to identify and
mitigate any time-varying effects that leak into the synchronously modulated
component of the signal. In this paper, the effect of emission from a $300$ K
VPM on the system performance is considered and addressed. Though instrument
design can greatly reduce the influence of modulated VPM emission, some
residual modulated signal is expected. VPM emission is treated in the presence
of rotational misalignments and temperature variation. Simulations of
time-ordered data are used to evaluate the effect of these residual errors on
the power spectrum. The analysis and modeling in this paper guides
experimentalists on the critical aspects of observations using VPMs as
front-end modulators. By implementing the characterizations and controls as
described, front-end VPM modulation can be very powerful for mitigating $1/f$
noise in large angular scale polarimetric surveys. None of the systematic
errors studied fundamentally limit the detection and characterization of
B-modes on large scales for a tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r=0.01$. Indeed,
$r<0.01$ is achievable with commensurately improved characterizations and
controls.

However, not much is known about their orientation at the ends of the cell.

synthesized frequency on FPGA is found to be 221 MHz and consumes 42% of FPGA
resources. The proposed method consumes very less power and can process 4K
resolution images at the rate of 60 frames per second which makes the hardware
suitable for handheld portable devices such as camera module and wireless image
sensors.
