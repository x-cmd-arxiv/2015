and in uniform random order. Informally, the associated cut-tree describes the
genealogy of the connected components created by this destruction process. We
provide a general criterion for the convergence of the rescaled cut-tree in the
Gromov-Prohorov topology to an interval endowed with the Euclidean distance and
a certain probability measure, when the underlying tree has a small height of
order $o(\sqrt{n})$. In particular, we consider uniform random recursive trees,
binary search trees, scale-free random trees and a mixture of regular trees.
This yields extensions of a result in Bertoin for the cut-tree of uniform
random recursive trees and also allows us to generalize some results of Kuba
and Panholzer on the multiple isolation of vertices. The approach relies in the
close relationship between the destruction process and Bernoulli bond
percolation, which may be useful for studying the cut-tree of other classes of
trees.

medium-sized telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array, which utilizes
imaging atmospheric Cherenkov techniques to observe gamma rays in the energy
range of 60Gev-60TeV. The pSCT novel aplanatic optical system is made of two
segmented aspheric mirrors. The primary mirror has 48 mirror panels with an
aperture of 9.6 m, while the secondary, made of 24 panels, has an diameter of
5.4 m. The resulting point spread function (PSF) is required to be better than
4 arcmin within a field of view of 6.4 degrees (80% of the field of view),
which corresponds to a physical size of 6.4 mm on the focal plane. This goal
represents a challenge for the inexpensive fabrication of aspheric mirror
panels and for the precise alignment of the optical system as well as for the
rigidity of the optical support structure. In this submission we introduce the
design of the Schwarzschild-Couder optical system and describe the solutions
adopted for the manufacturing of the mirror panels and their integration with

insurance claims that result from it. This will increase insurance premiums, in
a way that is independent of a customer's contribution to the causes of climate
change. Insurance provides a financial mechanism that mitigates some of the
consequences of climate change, allowing damage from increasingly frequent
events to be repaired. We observe that the insurance industry could reclaim any
increase in claims due to climate change, by increasing the insurance premiums
on energy producers for example, without needing government intervention or a
new tax. We argue that this insurance-led levy must acknowledge both present
carbon emissions and a modern industry's carbon inheritance, that is, to
recognise that fossil-fuel driven industrial growth has provided the
innovations and conditions needed for modern civilisation to exist and develop.
A tax or levy on energy production is one mechanism that would recognise carbon
inheritance through the increased (energy) costs for manufacturing and using
modern technology, and can also provide an incentive to minimise carbon
emissions, through higher costs for the most polluting industries. The
necessary increases in insurance premiums would initially be small, and will
require an event attribution (EA) methodology to determine their size. We
propose that the levies can be phased in as the science of event attribution
becomes sufficiently robust for each claim type, to ultimately provide a global
insurance-led response to climate change.

and their interplay is one of the most important unsolved problems. In FeSe,
the magnetic order is absent below the structural transition temperature
$T_{str}=90$K, in stark contrast that the magnetism emerges slightly below
$T_{str}$ in other families. To understand such amazing material dependence, we
investigate the spin-fluctuation-mediated orbital order ($n_{xz}\neq n_{yz}$)
by focusing on the orbital-spin interplay driven by the strong-coupling effect,
called the vertex correction. This orbital-spin interplay is very strong in
FeSe because of the small ratio between the Hund's and Coulomb interactions
($\bar{J}/\bar{U}$) and large $d_{xz},d_{yz}$-orbitals weight at the Fermi
level. For this reason, in the FeSe model, the orbital order is established
irrespective that the spin fluctuations are very weak, so the magnetism is
absent below $T_{str}$. In contrast, in the LaFeAsO model, the magnetic order
appears just below $T_{str}$ both experimentally and theoretically. Thus, the
orbital-spin interplay due to the vertex correction is the key ingredient in
understanding the rich phase diagram with nematicity and magnetism in Fe-based
superconductors in a unified way.

comparing it to two exact solutions: the Schwarzschild solution and the
Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi model. In order to make the comparison we consider
redshifts and lensing angles of photons passing through the simulation. These

that our scheme is more accurate than a Newtonian scheme, correctly reproducing
the leading-order post-Newtonian correction. In addition, our setup is able to
handle shell-crossings, which is not possible within a fluid model.
Furthermore, by introducing angular momentum, we find configurations

based on silicon or its related compounds, such as nitrides and oxides, is
expected to dramatically enhance silicon photonics by eliminating the need for
non-CMOS-compatible materials. While bulk Si is centrosymmetric and thus
displays no second-order (\c{hi}(2)) effects, a body of experimental evidence
accumulated in the last decade demonstrates that when a strain gradient is
present, a significant \c{hi}(2) and Pockels coefficient can be observed. In
this work we connect a strain-gradient-induced \c{hi}(2) with another
strain-gradient-induced phenomenon, the flexoelectric effect. We show that even
in the presence of an extremely strong strain gradient, the degree by which a
nonpolar material like Si can be altered cannot possibly explain the order of
magnitude of observed chi^(2) phenomena. At the same time, in a polar material
like SiN, each bond has a large nonlinear polarizability, so when the inversion
symmetry is broken by a strain gradient, a small (few degrees) re-orientation
of bonds can engender chi^(2) of the magnitude observed experimentally. It is
our view therefore that the origin of the nonlinear and electro-optic effects
in strained Si structures lies in not in the Si itself, but in the material
providing the strain: the silicon nitride cladding.

viewed as a generalization of $p$-adic random walk models used for description

Kolmogorov--Feller equations for the distribution function defined on the field
of $p$-adic numbers in which the probability of transitions per unit time
depends on ultrametric distance between the transition points as well as on
function of potential violating the spatial homogeneity of a random process.
This equation, which will be called the equation of $p$-adic random walk in a
potential, is equivalent to the equation of $p$-adic random walk with modified
measure and reaction source. With a special choice of a power-law potential the
last equation is shown to have an exact analytic solution. We find the analytic
solution of the Cauchy problem for such equation with an initial condition,
whose support lies in the ring of integer $p$-adic numbers. We also examine the
asymptotic behaviour of the distribution function for large times. It is shown
that in the limit $t\rightarrow\infty$ the distribution function tends to the
equilibrium solution according to the law, which is bounded from above and
below by power laws with the same exponent. Our principal conclusion is that
the introduction of a potential in the ultrametric model of conformational
dynamics of protein conserves the power-law behaviour of relaxation curves for

base station used to provide on the fly wireless communications to a given
geographical area is analyzed. In particular, the co-existence between the UAV,
that is transmitting data in the downlink, and an underlaid device-todevice
(D2D) communication network is considered. For this model, a tractable
analytical framework for the coverage and rate analysis is derived. Two
scenarios are considered: a static UAV and a mobile UAV. In the first scenario,
the average coverage probability and the system sum-rate for the users in the
area are derived as a function of the UAV altitude and the number of D2D users.
In the second scenario, using the disk covering problem, the minimum number of
stop points that the UAV needs to visit in order to completely cover the area
is computed. Furthermore, considering multiple retransmissions for the UAV and
D2D users, the overall outage probability of the D2D users is derived.
Simulation and analytical results show that, depending on the density of D2D
users, optimal values for the UAV altitude exist for which the system sum-rate
and the coverage probability are maximized. Moreover, our results also show
that, by enabling the UAV to intelligently move over the target area, the total
required transmit power of UAV while covering the entire area, is minimized.
Finally, in order to provide a full coverage for the area of interest, the
tradeoff between the coverage and delay, in terms of the number of stop points,
is discussed.

report here on a well-sampled light curve from 1889 to 2015, with unique
coverage of the prior century plus the entire duration of the PN formation plus
three decades of its aftermath. Surprisingly, the star anticipated the 1980's
ionization event by declining from B=10.30 in 1889 to B=10.76 in 1980. Starting
in 1980, the central star faded fast, at a rate of 0.20 mag/year, reaching
B=14.64 in 1996. This fast fading is apparently caused by the central star
shrinking in size. From 1994-2015, the V-band light curve is almost entirely
from the flux of two bright [OIII] emission lines from the unresolved nebula,
and it shows a consistent decline at a rate of 0.090 mag/year. This steady
fading (also seen in the radio and infrared) has a time scale equal to that
expected for ordinary recombination within the nebula, immediately after a
short-duration ionizing event in the 1980s. We are providing the first direct
measure of the rapidly changing luminosity of the central star on both sides of
a presumed thermal pulse in 1980, with this providing a strong and critical set
of constraints, and these are found to sharply disagree with theoretical models

nonnegative least squares fitting, we propose a new clustering/topic modeling

low-dimensional and correspond to discrete behavioral states, where previous
modeling work has found neural proxies for some of these states. Experimental
results further suggest that dynamics may be understood as long-timescale
transitions between multiple low-dimensional attractors. To identify
multistable regimes of our model, we develop a method for systematic generation
of bifurcation diagrams and their analysis in an interpretable low-dimensional
subspace, showing the existence and nature of multistable input responses at a
glance. Stimulation of the PLM neuron pair, experimentally associated with
forward movement and shown in simulation to drive a limit cycle, defines our
low-dimensional projection space. We then obtain bifurcation diagrams for
single-neuron excitation over a range of amplitudes and which classify whether
the dynamics in this projection space are associated with a limit cycle, fixed
point, or multiple states. In the specific case of compound input into both the
PLM pair and ASK pair we discover bistability of a limit cycle and a fixed
point, with transitional timescales between different states being much longer
than other timescales in the system. This suggests consistency of our model
with the characterization of dynamics in neural systems as long-timescale
transitions between discrete, low-dimensional attractors corresponding to
behavioral states. Our methodology thus prescribes a method for identifying
these states and transitions in response to arbitrary input.

and less sensitive to noise than classical light. Joint photons can sample an
object collectively, resulting in faster phase accumulation and higher spatial
resolution, while common components of noise can be subtracted. Even more, they
can accomplish this while physically separate, due to the nonlocal properties
of quantum mechanics. Indeed, nearly all quantum optics experiments rely on
this separation, using individual point detectors that are scanned to measure
coincidence counts and correlations. Scanning, however, is tedious, time
consuming, and ill-suited for imaging. Moreover, the separation of beam paths
adds complexity to the system while reducing the number of photons available
for sampling, and the multiplicity of detectors does not scale well for greater
numbers of photons and higher orders of entanglement. We bypass all of these
problems here by directly imaging collinear photon pairs with an
electron-multiplying CCD camera. We show explicitly the benefits of quantum
nonlocality by engineering the spatial entanglement of the illuminating photons
and introduce a new method of correlation measurement by converting time-domain
coincidence counting into spatial-domain detection of selected pixels. We show
that classical transport-of-intensity methods are applicable in the quantum

in 2003, and a 28-m diameter one (CT5), which was brought online in 2012. It is
the only IACT system featuring telescopes of different sizes, which provides
sensitivity for gamma rays across a very wide energy range, from ~30 GeV up to
~100 TeV. Since the camera electronics of CT1-4 are much older than the one of
CT5, an upgrade is being carried out; first deployment was in 2015, full
operation is planned for 2016. The goals of this upgrade are threefold:
reducing the dead time of the cameras, improving the overall performance of the
array and reducing the system failure rate related to aging. Upon completion,
the upgrade will assure the continuous operation of H.E.S.S. at its full

law entanglement of even highly excited eigenstates of many-body localized
Hamiltonians. Matrix Product States (MPS) can be used to efficiently represent
low entanglement (area law) wave functions in one dimension. An important
application of MPS is the widely used Density Matrix Renormalization Group

Here, we describe two algorithms, the Shift and Invert MPS (SIMPS) and excited
state DMRG which finds highly-excited eigenstates of many-body localized
Hamiltonians. Excited state DMRG uses a modified sweeping procedure to identify
eigenstates whereas SIMPS is a shift-inverse procedure that applies the inverse

on charged particles - for Majorana fermions. This is achieved in a variant of
a quantum spin system due to Kitaev which is distorted by triaxial strain. This
strained Kitaev model displays a spin-liquid phase with charge-neutral

a remarkable mechanism of probe-induced bound-state formation.

star low-mass X-ray binary GS 1826-24, commonly known as the ""clocked"" burster.
The transition to the soft state was recorded in 2014 June through an increase
of the 2-20 keV source intensity measured by MAXI, simultaneous with a decrease
of the 15-50 keV intensity measured by Swift/BAT. The episode lasted
approximately two months, after which the source returned to its usual hard
state. We analyze the broad-band spectrum measured by Swift/XRT and NuSTAR, and
estimate the accretion rate during the soft episode to be about 13% of
Eddington, within the range of previous observations. However, the best fit
spectral model, adopting the double Comptonization used previously, exhibits
significantly softer components. We detect seven type-I X-ray bursts, all
significantly weaker (and with shorter rise and decay times) than observed
previously. The burst profiles and recurrence times vary significantly, ruling
out the regular bursts that are typical for this source. One burst exhibited
photospheric radius expansion, and we estimate the source distance at about
(5.7 / xi_b^1/2) kpc, where xi_b parameterizes the possible anisotropy of the
burst emission. Interpreting the soft state as a transition from an optically
thin inner flow to an optically thick flow passing through a boundary layer, as
is commonly observed in similar systems, is contradicted by the lower optical
depth measured for the double Comptonization model we find for this soft state.
The effect of a change in disk geometry on the burst behavior remains unclear.

stars and the first galaxies. However, a low metallicity does not prove that a
star formed in this ancient era, as metal-poor stars form over a range of
redshift in different environments. Theoretical models of Milky Way formation
have shown that at constant metallicity, the oldest stars are those closest to
the center of the Galaxy on the most tightly-bound orbits. For that reason, the
most metal-poor stars in the bulge of the Milky Way provide excellent tracers
of the chemistry of the high-redshift universe. We report the dynamics and
detailed chemical abundances of three stars in the bulge with [Fe/H]
$\lesssim-2.7$, two of which are the most metal-poor stars in the bulge in the
literature. We find that with the exception of scandium, all three stars follow
the abundance trends identified previously for metal-poor halo stars. These
three stars have the lowest [Sc II/Fe] abundances yet seen in $\alpha$-enhanced
giant stars in the Galaxy. Moreover, all three stars are outliers in the
otherwise tight [Sc II/Fe]-[Ti II/Fe] relation observed among metal-poor halo
stars. Theoretical models predict that there is a 30% chance that at least one
of these stars formed at $z\gtrsim15$, while there is a 70% chance that at
least one formed at $10 \lesssim z \lesssim 15$. These observations imply that
by $z\sim10$, the progenitor galaxies of the Milky Way had both reached [Fe/H]

doublet at 1.14 {\mu}m. Like the Na I 0.82 {\mu}m doublet, this feature is
strong in low-mass stars and hence may provide a useful probe of the initial
mass function (IMF). From high signal-to-noise composite spectra, we find that
Na I 1.14 {\mu}m increases steeply with increasing velocity dispersion,
{\sigma}, and for the most massive galaxies (\sigma > 300 km/s) is much
stronger than predicted from synthetic spectra with Milky-Way-like IMFs and
solar abundances. Reproducing Na I 1.14 {\mu}m at high {\sigma} likely requires
either a very high [Na/H], or a bottom-heavy IMF, or a combination of both.
Using the Na D line to break the degeneracy between IMF and abundance, we infer
[Na/H] $\approx$ +0.5 and a steep IMF (single-slope-equivalent x $\approx$ 3.2,
where x = 2.35 for Salpeter), for the high-\sigma galaxies. At lower mass
({\sigma} = 50-100 km/s), the line strengths are compatible with MW-like IMFs
and near-solar [Na/H]. We highlight two galaxies in our sample where strong
gravitational lensing masses favour MW-like IMFs. Like the high-{\sigma} sample
on average, these galaxies have strong Na I 1.14 \mu m; taken in isolation
their sodium indices imply bottom-heavy IMFs which are hard to reconcile with
the lensing masses. An alternative full-spectrum-fitting approach, applied to
the high-\sigma sample, recovers an IMF less heavy than Salpeter, but
under-predicts the Na I 1.14 \mu m line at the 5{\sigma} level. We conclude
that current models struggle to reproduce this feature in the most massive
galaxies without breaking other constraints, and caution against over-reliance
on the sodium lines in spectroscopic IMF studies.

Star-forming emission-line galaxies (Ly{\alpha} and H{\alpha} emitters) are
used to probe the environments at high redshifts. Radio galaxies are predicted
to be hosted by more massive haloes than quasars, and this is imprinted on the
amplitude of galaxy overdensities and cross-correlation functions. We find that
Ly{\alpha} radiative transfer and AGN feedback indirectly affect the clustering
on small scales and also the stellar masses, star- formation rates and gas
metallicities of galaxies in dense environments. We also investigate the
relation between protoclusters associated with radio galaxies and quasars, and
their present- day cluster descendants. The progenitors of massive clusters
associated with radio galaxies and quasars allow us to determine an average
protocluster size in a simple way. Overdensities within the protoclusters are
found to correlate with the halo descendant masses. We present scaling
relations that can be applied to observational data. By computing projection
effects due to the wavelength resolution of modern spectrographs and
narrow-band filters we show that the former have enough spectral resolution to
map the structure of protoclusters, whereas the latter can be used to measure
the clustering around radio galaxies and quasars over larger scales to
determine the mass of dark matter haloes hosting them.

gravitationally bound subhalos within the virial radius of each host halo. Over
the ranges set by our spatial resolution our convergence is excellent and
improvements were made upon current state-of-the-art halo finders to better
identify substructure at such high resolutions (e.g., on average we recover
$\sim$4 subhalos in each host halo above 10$^8$ M$_\odot$ which would have
otherwise not been found using conventional methods). For our relaxed halos,
the inner profiles are reasonably fit by Einasto profiles ($\alpha$ = 0.169

a given halo. Averaging over all halos, the substructure mass fraction is
$f_{m,subs} = 0.121 \pm 0.041$, and mass function slope is d$N$/d$M\propto

mass due to more concentrated hosts having less subhalos at fixed subhalo mass.

northern-sky LOFAR imaging survey. In this introductory paper, we first
describe in detail the motivation and design of the survey. Compared to
previous radio surveys, MSSS is exceptional due to its intrinsic multifrequency
nature providing information about the spectral properties of the detected
sources over more than two octaves (from 30 to 160 MHz). The broadband
frequency coverage, together with the fast survey speed generated by LOFAR's
multibeaming capabilities, make MSSS the first survey of the sort anticipated
to be carried out with the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Two of the
sixteen frequency bands included in the survey were chosen to exactly overlap
the frequency coverage of large-area Very Large Array (VLA) and Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (GMRT) surveys at 74 MHz and 151 MHz respectively. The survey
performance is illustrated within the ""MSSS Verification Field"" (MVF), a region
of 100 square degrees centered at J2000 (RA,Dec)=(15h,69deg). The MSSS results
from the MVF are compared with previous radio survey catalogs. We assess the
flux and astrometric uncertainties in the catalog, as well as the completeness
and reliability considering our source finding strategy. We determine the 90%
completeness levels within the MVF to be 100 mJy at 135 MHz with 108""
resolution, and 550 mJy at 50 MHz with 166"" resolution. Images and catalogs for
the full survey, expected to contain 150,000-200,000 sources, will be released
to a public web server. We outline the plans for the ongoing production of the
final survey products, and the ultimate public release of images and source
catalogs.

all-sky hard X-ray survey to investigate if the observed declining trend of the
fraction of obscured (i.e. showing X-ray absorption) AGN with increasing
luminosity is mostly an intrinsic or selection effect. Using a
torus-obscuration model, we demonstrate that in addition to negative bias, due
to absorption in the torus, in finding obscured AGN in hard X-ray flux limited
surveys, there is also positive bias in finding unobscured AGN, due to Compton
reflection in the torus. These biases can be even stronger taking into account
plausible intrinsic collimation of hard X-ray emission along the axis of the
obscuring torus. Given the AGN luminosity function, which steepens at high
luminosities, these observational biases lead to a decreasing observed fraction
of obscured AGN with increasing luminosity even if this fraction has no
intrinsic luminosity dependence. We find that if the central hard X-ray source
in AGN is isotropic, the intrinsic (i.e. corrected for biases) obscured AGN
fraction still shows a declining trend with luminosity, although the intrinsic
obscured fraction is significantly larger than the observed one: the actual
fraction is larger than $\sim 85$% at $L\lesssim 10^{42.5}$ erg/s (17--60 keV),
and decreases to $\lesssim 60$% at $L\gtrsim 10^{44}$ erg/s. In terms of the
half-opening angle, $\theta$, of an obscuring torus, this implies that
$\theta\lesssim 30$ deg in lower-luminosity AGN, and $\theta\gtrsim 45$ deg in
higher-luminosity ones. If, however, the emission from the central SMBH is
collimated as $dL/d\Omega\propto\cos\alpha$, the intrinsic dependence of the
obscured AGN fraction is consistent with a luminosity-independent torus
half-opening angle $\theta\sim 30$ deg.

one-hole-doped anisotropic two-leg $t$-$J$ ladder using variational Monte Carlo
(VMC) method. The results are then systematically compared with those recently
obtained by density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation. An
excellent agreement is found between the VMC and DMRG results, including a
""quantum critical point"" at the anisotropy parameter
$\alpha=\alpha_c\approx0.7$ (with the parameters $t/J=3$), and the emergence of
charge modulation and momentum (Fermi point) reconstruction at
$\alpha>\alpha_c$ due to the quantum interference of the sign structure. In
particular, the wave function indicates that a Landau's quasiparticle
description remains valid at $\alpha<\alpha_c$ but fails at $\alpha>\alpha_c$
due to the breakdown of the one-to-one correspondence of momentum and
translational symmetry of the hole. The explicit form of the wave function
provides a direct understanding on how the many-body strong correlation effect
takes place non-perturbatively in a doped Mott insulator, which sheds
interesting light on the two-dimensional case where the same type of wave
function was proposed to describe the cuprate superconductor.

relative to Eddington (L/L_EDD). Since M_BH and L/L_EDD are correlated, we
create AGN subsamples in one parameter while maintaining the same distribution
in the other parameter. In both the X-ray and optically-selected AGN samples we
detect a weak clustering dependence with M_BH and no statistically significant
dependence on L/L_EDD. We find a difference of up to 2.7sigma when comparing
the objects that belong to the 30% least and 30% most massive M_BH subsamples,

evidence that higher accretion rates in AGN do not necessarily require dense

based on power-law or exponential modifications of the resonant diffusion

constrained by comparing the results of Fokker-Planck integrations with
previously-published N-body integrations. Steady-state solutions are then
obtained via the Fokker-Planck equation for models with properties similar to
those of the Milky Way nucleus. Inclusion of anomalous relaxation leads to the
formation of less prominent cores than in the case of resonant relaxation
alone, due to the lengthening of diffusion timescales for eccentric orbits.
Steady-state capture rates of stars by the SBH are found to always be less, by
as much as an order of magnitude, than capture rates in the presence of

equation into hydrodynamic equations of a virtual fluid. Here we show that an
increase of the Boltzmann entropy of this Madelung fluid is proportional to the
expectation value of its velocity divergence. Hence, entropy growth is
accompanied by expansion resulting from the ability of the Madelung fluid to be
compressible. The compressibility itself reflects superposition of solutions of
the Schrodinger equation. Thus, in unitary processes where the Madelung fluid
expands and then shrinks, the Boltzmann entropy may, correspondingly, grow and
then decrease. The notion of entropy growth due to expansion is common in
diffusive processes, however in the latter the process is irreversible. Much
unlike the Boltzmann entropy, the von Neumann entropy, does not vary with time.
To elucidate the physical underpinning of the Boltzmann entropy, we examine
several specific examples. We demonstrate that, for classical diffusive
processes, the ""force"" accelerating diffusion has the form of the positive
gradient of the quantum Bohm potential. In the Madelung fluid, the advective
and the diffusive velocities correspond respectively to the the real and
imaginary parts of the complex momentum. We find that the diffusion coefficient
provides a lower bound of Heisenberg uncertainty type product between the gas
mean free path and the Brownian momentum.

particles which string together and interact to perform the computation. In
this construction, the movement of one particle is controlled by the presence
or absence of other particles, an effective quantum field effect transistor
that allows the construction of controlled-NOT and controlled-rotation gates.
The construction translates into a model for universal quantum computation with
time-independent 2-qubit ZZ and XX+YY interactions on an (almost) planar grid.
The effective Hamiltonian is arrived at by a single use of first-order
perturbation theory avoiding the use of perturbation gadgets. The dynamics and
spectral properties of the effective Hamiltonian can be fully determined as it
corresponds to a particular realization of a mapping between a quantum circuit
and a Hamiltonian called the space-time circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction.
Because of the simple interactions required, and because no higher-order
perturbation gadgets are employed, our construction is potentially realizable
using superconducting or other solid-state qubits.

exploiting gravitationally lensed sources drawn primarily from the CASSOWARY

with coarser sampling using multiple-IFU instruments. We demonstrate how
kinematic complexities essential to understanding the maturity of an early

Although we include four sources from our earlier work, the present study
provides a more representative sample unbiased with respect to emission line
strength. Contrary to earlier suggestions, our data indicates a more diverse
range of kinematic and metal gradient behavior inconsistent with a simple
picture of well-ordered rotation developing concurrently with established steep
metal gradients in all but merging systems. Comparing our observations with the

been mixed by outflows or other strong feedback processes, flattening the metal

periodic exchanges of the disk eccentricity with inclination. The disk KL
mechanism is quite robust and operates over a wide range of binary and disk
parameters. However, the effects of self-gravity, which are expected to
suppress the KL oscillations for sufficiently massive disks, were ignored.
Here, we analyze the effects of disk self-gravity by means of hydrodynamic
simulations and compare the results with the expectations of analytic theory.
The disk mass required for suppression in the simulations is a few percent of
the mass of the central star and this roughly agrees with an analytical
estimate. The conditions for suppression of the KL oscillations in the
simulations are close to requiring that the disk be gravitationally unstable.

curve described by its momentum vector. For a general central orbit problem the
hodograph is the inverse of the pedal curve of the orbit, (i.e. its polar
reciprocal), rotated through a right angle. Hamilton showed that for the
Kepler/Coulomb problem, the hodograph is a circle whose centre is in the
direction of a conserved eccentricity vector. The addition of an inverse cube
law force induces the eccentricity vector to precess and with it the hodograph.
The same effect is produced by a cosmic string. If one takes the relativistic
momentum to define the hodograph, then for the Sommerfeld (i.e. the special
relativistic Kepler/Coulomb problem) there is an effective inverse cube force
which causes the hodograph to precess. If one uses Schwarzschild coordinates
one may also define a a hodograph for timelike or null geodesics moving around
a black hole. Iheir pedal equations are given. In special cases the hodograph
may be found explicitly. For example the orbit of a photon which starts from
the past singularity, grazes the horizon and returns to future singularity is a
cardioid, its pedal equation is Cayley's sextic the inverse of which is
Tschirhausen's cubic. It is also shown that that provided one uses Beltrami

reviews, face two challenges. First, the opinionated documents constitute an
evolving stream, where both the author's attitude and the vocabulary itself may
change. Second, labels of documents are scarce and labels of words are
unreliable, because the sentiment of a word depends on the (unknown) context in
the author's mind. Most of the research on mining over opinionated streams
focuses on the first aspect of the problem, whereas for the second a continuous
supply of labels from the stream is assumed. Such an assumption though is
utopian as the stream is infinite and the labeling cost is prohibitive. To this
end, we investigate the potential of active stream learning algorithms that ask
for labels on demand. Our proposed ACOSTREAM 1 approach works with limited
labels: it uses an initial seed of labeled documents, occasionally requests
additional labels for documents from the human expert and incrementally adapts
to the underlying stream while exploiting the available labeled documents. In
its core, ACOSTREAM consists of a MNB classifier coupled with ""sampling""
strategies for requesting class labels for new unlabeled documents. In the
experiments, we evaluate the classifier performance over time by varying: (a)
the class distribution of the opinionated stream, while assuming that the set
of the words in the vocabulary is fixed but their polarities may change with
the class distribution; and (b) the number of unknown words arriving at each
moment, while the class polarity may also change. Our results show that active
learning on a stream of opinionated documents, delivers good performance while
requiring a small selection of labels

$\mathfrak{f}_r$, of a stable Lie superalgebra is considered in detail and used
to construct super vector bundles over projective space $\mathbb{P}^{r-1}$.
Finally, a complete classification of supermodules of constant super Jordan

For a fixed class C of oriented graphs, the orientation completion problem asks
whether a given partially oriented graph P can be completed to an oriented
graph in C by orienting the (non-oriented) edges in P. Orien- tation completion
problems commonly generalize several existing problems including recognition of
certain classes of graphs and digraphs as well as extending representations of
certain geometrically representable graphs. We study orientation completion
problems for various classes of oriented graphs, including k-arc- strong
oriented graphs, k-strong oriented graphs, quasi-transitive oriented graphs,
local tournament, acyclic local tournaments, locally transitive tournaments,
locally transitive local tournaments, in- tournaments, and oriented graphs
which have directed cycle factors. We show that the orientation completion
problem for each of these classes is either polynomial time solvable or
NP-complete. We also show that some of the NP-complete problems become
polynomial time solvable when the input oriented graphs satisfy certain extra

proper interval graphs and for proper circular arc graphs are polynomial time
solvable, which generalize a previous result.

studied with the goal of sorting spheres with identical resonances, which are
critical for developing microspherical photonics. First, evanescent field
couplers were developed by fixing tapered microfibers in mechanically robust
platforms. The tapers were obtained by chemical etching techniques. Using these
platforms, WGMs modal numbers, coupling regimes and quality factors were
determined for various spheres and compared with theory. Second, the
spectroscopic properties of photonic molecules formed by spheres with better
than 0.05% uniformity of WGM resonances were studied. It was shown that various
spatial configurations of coupled-cavities present relatively stable mode
splitting patterns in the fiber transmission spectra which can be used as
spectral signatures to distinguish such photonic molecules. The third part is
the study of giant resonant propulsion forces exerted on microspheres. This
effect was observed in suspensions of polystyrene spheres with sufficiently
large diameters. By integrating optical tweezers for individual sphere
manipulation, the wavelength detuning between a tunable laser and WGMs in each
of the spheres was precisely controlled. Resonant enhancement of optical forces
was directly demonstrated in experiments. The spectral shape, position and
magnitude of the observed propulsion force peaks were explained by efficient
transfer of light momentum to microspheres under resonant conditions. The peak
magnitude of the resonant force is shown to approach total absorption limit
imposed by the conservation of momentum. The transverse movement of the spheres
during the propulsion process was studied and the existence of a stable radial
trap was demonstrated. Giant resonant propulsion forces can be used for
large-scale sorting of microspheres with ultrahigh uniform resonant properties.

distance (MDD) of a linear sequence of nodes (constrained by continuity or

brings about less dependency crossings as well, though having failed to reduce
them, to such rarity as found in human languages. These results suggest that
chunking may play a vital role in the minimization of dependency distance, and
a somewhat contributing role in the rarity of dependency crossing. In addition,
the results point to a possibility that the rarity of dependency crossings is
not a mere side-effect of minimization of dependency distance, but a linguistic
phenomenon with its own motivations.

that has emissivity of unity between 0.719 eV and 0.763 eV and zero elsewhere.
This optimal spectrum is less than half of the width of those when thermal
losses are neglected. A maximum output power density of 41708 Wm-2 is
achievable with a spectrum having emissivity values of unity between 0.684 eV

emission spectra are shown to greatly outperform blackbody and tungsten
radiators, and could be obtained using artificial structures such as
metamaterials or photonic crystals.

we report a calculation of magnetisation and susceptibility of electrons in an
inversion layer, taking into account the co-ordinate dependence of electron
wave function in the direction perpendicular to the plane. It is assumed that
the inversion-layer carriers interact via a contact repulsive potential, which
is treated at a mean-field level, resulting in a self-consistent change of
profile of the wave functions. We find that the results differ significantly
from those obtained in the pure 2DEG case (where no provision is made for a
quantum motion in the transverse direction). Specifically, the critical value
of interaction needed to attain the ferromagnetic (Stoner) instability is
decreased and the Stoner criterion is therefore relaxed. This leads to an
increased susceptibility and ultimately to a ferromagnetic transition deep in
the high-density metallic regime. In the opposite limit of low carrier
densities, a phenomenological treatment of the in-plane correlation effects
suggests a ferromagnetic instability above the metal-insulator transition.
Results are discussed in the context of the available experimental data.

to the disease, which in turn plays a crucial role on the spreading of
epidemic. In this study, to illustrate the impacts of the human behavioral
responses, a new class of individuals, $S^F$, is introduced to the classical
susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$) model. In the model, $S^F$ state
represents that susceptible individuals who take self-initiate protective
measures to lower the probability of being infected, and a susceptible
individual may go to $S^F$ state with a response rate when contacting an
infectious neighbor. Via the percolation method, the theoretical formulas for
the epidemic threshold as well as the prevalence of epidemic are derived. Our
finding indicates that, with the increasing of the response rate, the epidemic
threshold is enhanced and the prevalence of epidemic is reduced. The analytical
results are also verified by the numerical simulations. In addition, we
demonstrate that, because the mean field method neglects the dynamic
correlations, a wrong result based on the mean field method is obtained---the
epidemic threshold is not related to the response rate, i.e., the additional
$S^F$ state has no impact on the epidemic threshold.

intracluster medium, in particular the profiles of density, temperature and
related quantities, as well as integrated measurements of gas mass, average
temperature, total luminosity and center-excluded luminosity. We fit power-law
scaling relations of each of these quantities as a function of redshift and
cluster mass, which can be measured precisely and with minimal bias for these
relaxed clusters using hydrostatic arguments. For the thermodynamic profiles,
we jointly model the density and temperature and their intrinsic scatter as a
function of radius, thus also capturing the behavior of the gas pressure and
entropy. For the integrated quantities, we also jointly fit a multidimensional
intrinsic covariance. Our results reinforce the view that simple hydrodynamical
models provide a good description of relaxed clusters outside their centers,
but that additional heating and cooling processes are important in the inner
regions (radii $r < 0.5r_{2500} \approx 0.15r_{500}$). The thermodynamic
profiles remain regular, with small intrinsic scatter, down to the smallest
radii where deprojection is straightforward ($\sim 20$ kpc); within this
radius, even the most relaxed systems show clear departures from spherical
symmetry. Our results suggest that heating and cooling are continuously
regulated in a tight feedback loop, allowing the cluster atmosphere to remain
stratified on these scales.

$\{l_1,l_2\}$-eavesdropper model, where the eavesdropper can observe the data
stored on $l_1$ nodes and the repair downloads of an additional $l_2$ nodes.
Compared to minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes which support only single
node repairs, MSCR codes allow efficient simultaneous repairs of multiple
failed nodes, referred to as a \emph{repair group}. However, the repair data
sent from a helper node to another failed node may vary with different repair
groups or the sets of helper nodes, which would inevitably leak more data
information to the eavesdropper and even render the storage system unable to
maintain any data secrecy.
  In this paper, we introduce and study a special category of MSCR codes,
termed ""\emph{stable}"" MSCR codes, where the repair data from any one helper
node to any one failed node is required to be independent of the repair group
or the set of helper nodes. Our main contributions include: 1. Demonstrating
that two existing MSCR codes inherently are not stable and thus have poor
secrecy capacity, 2. Converting one existing MSCR code to a stable one, which
offers better secrecy capacity when compared to the original one, 3. Employing
information theoretic analysis to characterize the secrecy capacity of stable

semantic segmentation are rapidly reaching maturity, and given the recent rate
of progress, it is not unreasonable to conjecture that techniques for many of
these problems will approach human levels of performance in the next few years.
In this paper we look to the future: what is the next frontier in visual
recognition?
  We offer one possible answer to this question. We propose a detailed image
annotation that captures information beyond the visible pixels and requires
complex reasoning about full scene structure. Specifically, we create an amodal
segmentation of each image: the full extent of each region is marked, not just
the visible pixels. Annotators outline and name all salient regions in the
image and specify a partial depth order. The result is a rich scene structure,
including visible and occluded portions of each region, figure-ground edge
information, semantic labels, and object overlap.
  We create two datasets for semantic amodal segmentation. First, we label 500
images in the BSDS dataset with multiple annotators per image, allowing us to
study the statistics of human annotations. We show that the proposed full scene
annotation is surprisingly consistent between annotators, including for regions
and edges. Second, we annotate 5000 images from COCO. This larger dataset
allows us to explore a number of algorithmic ideas for amodal segmentation and
depth ordering. We introduce novel metrics for these tasks, and along with our
strong baselines, define concrete new challenges for the community.

managing replica creation in geo-distributed infrastructures by (1) minimizing
the time needed to copy the data to the new replica location, (2) avoiding

results show that, compared to swift (the OpenStack project for managing data

25% of inter-data center network traffic, while ensuring the minimum required

messages to all the receivers (multicast scenario), and each receiver has
'coded side information', i.e., prior information in the form of linear
combinations of the messages. This channel model is motivated by applications
to multi-terminal networks where the nodes may have access to coded versions of
the messages from previous signal hops or through orthogonal channels. The
capacity of this channel is known and follows from the work of Tuncel (2006),

approach of Erez and Zamir, we design lattice codes for this family of channels
when the source messages are symbols from a finite field 'Fp' of prime size.
Our coding scheme utilizes Construction A lattices designed over the same prime
field 'Fp', and uses algebraic binning at the decoders to expurgate the channel
code and obtain good lattice subcodes, for every possible set of linear
combinations available as side information. The achievable rate of our coding
scheme is a function of the size 'p' of underlying prime field, and approaches
the capacity as 'p' tends to infinity.

interesting emergent behavior from propagating density bands to density shock
waves. A deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for these
emergent structures is relevant to a number of physical and biomedical
applications. Here, we study the formation of density shock waves in the
context of an idealized model of microswimmers confined in a narrow channel and
subject to a uniform external flow. Interestingly, these density shock waves
exhibit a transition from `subsonic' with compression at the back to
`supersonic' with compression at the front of the population as the intensity
of the external flow increases. This behavior is the result of a non-trivial
interplay between hydrodynamic interactions and geometric confinement, and is
confirmed by a novel quasilinear wave model that properly captures the
dependence of the shock formation on the external flow. These findings can be
used to guide the development of novel mechanisms for controlling the emergent
density distribution and average population speed, with potentially profound
implications on various processes in industry and biotechnology such as the
transport and sorting of cells in flow channels.

argue that linear detection functions should be preferred in this regard due to

approach in this regard is to represent a sequence using a bag of words (BOW)
representation due to its: (i) fixed dimensionality irrespective of the
sequence length, and (ii) its ability to compactly model the statistics in the
sequence. A drawback to the BOW representation, however, is the intrinsic
destruction of the temporal ordering information. In this paper we propose a
new representation that leverages the uncertainty in relative temporal
alignments between pairs of sequences while not destroying temporal ordering.
Our representation, like BOW, is of a fixed dimensionality making it easily
integrated with a linear detection function. Extensive experiments on CK+,

like density dependence, while ecological predictions can be complicated by
evolutionary change. A widely used approach in micro-evolution, quantitative
genetics, struggles to incorporate ecological processes into predictive models,
while structured population modelling, a tool widely used in ecology, rarely
incorporates evolution explicitly.
  2) In this paper we develop a flexible, general framework that links
quantitative genetics and structured population models. We use the quantitative
genetic approach to write down the phenotype as an additive map. We then
construct integral projection models for each component of the phenotype. The
dynamics of the distribution of the phenotype are generated by combining
distributions of each of its components. Population projection models can be
formulated on per generation or on shorter time steps.
  3) We introduce the framework before developing example models with
parameters chosen to exhibit specific dynamics. These models reveal (i) how
evolution of a phenotype can cause populations to move from one dynamical
regime to another (e.g. from stationarity to cycles), (ii) how additive genetic
variances and covariances (the G matrix) are expected to evolve over multiple
generations, (iii) how changing heritability with age can maintain additive
genetic variation in the face of selection and (iii) life history, population
dynamics, phenotypic characters and parameters in ecological models will change
as adaptation occurs.
  4) Our approach unifies population ecology and evolutionary biology providing
a framework allowing a very wide range of questions to be addressed. The next
step is to apply the approach to a variety of laboratory and field systems.
Once this is done we will have a much deeper understanding of eco-evolutionary
dynamics and feedbacks.

scheme, where the power beacons (PBs) adapt the energy beamforming strategy to
SNs' locations by concentrating the transmit power on the nearby SNs within the
efficient charging radius. With the aid of stochastic geometry, we derive the
closed-form expressions of the distribution metrics of the aggregate received
power at a typical SN and further approximate the complementary cumulative
distribution function using Gamma distribution with second-order moment
matching. To design the charging radius for the optimal AD-WPT operation, we
exploit the tradeoff between the power intensity of the energy beams and the
number of SNs to be charged. Depending on different SN task requirements, the
optimal AD-WPT can maximize the average received power or the active
probability of the SNs, respectively. It is shown that both the maximized
average received power and the maximized sensor active probability increase
with the increased deployment density and transmit power of the PBs, and
decrease with the increased density of the SNs and the energy beamwidth.
Finally, we show that the optimal AD-WPT can significantly improve the energy

operators was initiated in [9]. Natural examples arise from $(1+1)$-dimensional
differential operators using the model operator $D_A$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2; dt
dx)$ of the type $D_A = (d/dt) + A$, where $A = \int^{\oplus}_{\mathbb{R}} dt
\, A(t)$, and the family of self-adjoint operators $A(t)$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R};
dx)$ is explicitly given by $A(t) = - i (d/dx) + \theta(t) \phi(\cdot)$, $t \in
\mathbb{R}$. Here $\phi: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ has to be integrable on
$\mathbb{R}$ and $\theta: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ tends to zero as $t \to -
\infty$ and to $1$ as $t \to + \infty$. In particular, $A(t)$ has asymptotes in
the norm resolvent sense $A_- = - i (d/dx)$, $A_+ = - i (d/dx) + \phi(\cdot)$
as $t \to \mp \infty$.
  Since $D_A$ violates the relative trace class condition introduced in [9], we
now employ a new approach based on an approximation technique. The approximants
do fit the framework of [9] and lead to the following results: Introducing $H_1
= {D_A}^* D_A$, $H_2 = D_A {D_A}^*$, we recall that the resolvent regularized
Witten index of $D_A$, denoted by $W_r(D_A)$, is defined by $$ W_r(D_A) =
\lim_{\lambda \to 0} (- \lambda) {\rm tr}_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^2; dtdx)}((H_1 -
\lambda I)^{-1} - (H_2 - \lambda I)^{-1}). $$ In the concrete example at hand,
we prove $$ W_r(D_A) = \xi(0_+; H_2, H_1) = \xi(0; A_+, A_-) = 1/(2 \pi)
\int_{\mathbb{R}} dx \, \phi(x). $$ Here $\xi(\, \cdot \, ; S_2, S_1)$, denotes
the spectral shift operator for the pair $(S_2,S_1)$, and we employ the
normalization, $\xi(\lambda; H_2, H_1) = 0$, $\lambda < 0$.

problems in comparative planetology. Here a new concept is proposed to explain
water removal on a steam-covered proto Venus, referred to as impact-driven
planetary desiccation. Since a steam atmosphere is photochemically unstable,
water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen. Then, hydrogen escapes easily
into space through hydrodynamic escape driven by strong extreme ultraviolet
radiation from the young Sun. The focus is on the intense impact bombardment
during the terminal stage of planetary accretion as generators of a significant
amount of reducing agent. The fine-grained ejecta remove the residual oxygen,
the counter part of escaped hydrogen, via the oxidation of iron-bearing rocks
in a hot atmosphere. Thus, hypervelocity impacts cause net desiccation of the
planetary surface. I constructed a stochastic cratering model using a Monte
Carlo approach to investigate the cumulative mass of nonoxidized, ejected rocks
due to the intense impact bombardment. It is shown that a thick steam
atmosphere with a mass equivalent to that of the terrestrial oceans would be
removed. The cumulative mass of rocky ejecta released into the atmosphere
reaches 1 wt% of the host planet, which is 10000 times of the current mass of
the Earths atmosphere. These results strongly suggest that chemical reactions
between such large amounts of ejecta and planetary atmospheres are among the
key factors required to understand atmospheric mass and its composition, not
only in the Solar System but also in extrasolar systems.

First of all, we developed statistical theory which allowed us to produce
confidence intervals for Rosenthal's fail-safe number.This was produced by
discerning whether the number of studies analysed in a meta-analysis is fixed
or random. Each case produces different variance estimators. For a given number
of studies and a given distribution, we provided five variance estimators.
Confidence intervals are examined with a normal approximation and a
nonparametric bootstrap. The accuracy of the different confidence interval
estimates was then tested by methods of simulation under different
distributional assumptions. The half normal distribution variance estimator has
the best probability coverage. Finally, we provide a table of lower confidence

gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds. For the first time, we consistently take
into account the synchrotron emission generated by secondary electrons and
require the clusters radio counts to be respected. For a choice of parameters
respecting current constraints from radio to gamma-rays, and assuming a proton
spectral index of -2, we find that hadronic interactions in clusters contribute
by less than 10% to the IceCube flux, and much less to the total extragalactic
gamma-ray background observed by Fermi. They account for less than 1% for
spectral indexes <-2. The high-energy neutrino flux observed by IceCube can be
reproduced without violating radio constraints only if a very hard (and
speculative) spectral index >-2 is adopted. However, this scenario is in
tension with the high-energy IceCube data, which seem to suggest a spectral
energy distribution of the neutrino flux that decreases with the particle
energy. We stress that our results are valid for all kind of sources injecting
CR protons into the ICM, and that, while IceCube can test the most optimistic
scenarios for spectral indexes >=-2.2 by stacking few nearby massive objects,
clusters of galaxies cannot give any relevant contribution to the extragalactic

component through a wide square channel, the ends of which are plugged with
sintered silver superleaks, the flow being generated by compression of a
bellows. The superleaks ensure that there is no net flow of the normal fluid.
In an earlier paper (Phys. Rev. B, 86, 134515 (2012)) we have shown that steady
flow of this kind generates a density of vortex lines that is essentially
identical with that generated by thermal counterflow, when the average relative
velocity between the two fluids is the same. In this paper we report on studies
of the temporal decay of the vortex-line density, observed when the bellows is
stopped, and we compare the results with those obtained from the temporal decay
of thermal counterflow re-measured in the same channel and under the same
conditions. In both cases here is an initial fast decay which, for low enough
initial line density approaches for a short time the form $t^{-1}$
characteristic of the decay of a random vortex tangle. This is followed at late
times by a slower $t^{-3/2}$ decay, characteristic of the decay of large
'quasi-classical eddies'. However, in the range of investigated parameters, we
observe always in the case of thermal counterflow, and only in a few cases of
high steady-state velocity in superflow, an intermediate regime in which the
decay either does not proceed monotonically with time or passes through a point
of inflexion. This difference, established firmly by our experiments, might
represent one essential ingredient for the full theoretical understanding of

systems. In contrast to general multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
cellular schemes, multibeam satellite architectures suffer from different
challenges. First, satellite communications standards embed more than one user
in each frame in order to increase the channel coding gain. This leads to the
different so-called multigroup multicast model, whose optimization requires
computationally complex operations. Second, when the data traffic is generated
by several Earth stations (gateways), the precoding matrix must be
distributively computed and attain additional payload restrictions. Third,
since the feedback channel is adverse (large delay and quantization errors),
the precoding must be able to deal with such uncertainties. In order to solve
the aforementioned problems, we propose a two-stage precoding design in order
to both limit the multibeam interference and to enhance the intra-beam minimum
user signal power (i.e. the one that dictates the rate allocation per beam). A
robust version of the proposed precoder based on a first perturbation model is
presented. This mechanism behaves well when the channel state information is
corrupted. Furthermore, we propose a per beam user grouping mechanism together
with its robust version in order to increase the precoding gain. Finally, a
method for dealing with the multiple gateway architecture is presented, which
offers high throughputs with a low inter-gateway communication. The conceived
designs are evaluated in a close-to-real beam pattern and the latest broadband
communication standard for satellite communications.

issue of primary importance in population biology. The first theoretical
approach to the problem dates back to the 50's with the KiSS (after Kierstead,
Slobodkin and Skellam) model, namely a continuous reaction-diffusion equation
for a population growing on a patch of finite size $L$ surrounded by a deadly
environment with infinite mortality -- i.e. an oasis in a desert. The main
outcome of the model is that only patches above a critical size allow for
population persistence. Here, we introduce an individual-based analogue of the
KiSS model to investigate the effects of discreteness and demographic
stochasticity. In particular, we study the average time to extinction both
above and below the critical patch size of the continuous model and investigate
the quasi-stationary distribution of the number of individuals for patch sizes
above the critical threshold.

amplitude of the magnetic field gradient. In addition, an increase of the NV

otherwise constant accretion rate the total line variability (dominated by the
narrow line contributions) reverberates the continuum variability with a
dependency $\Delta L_{line} \propto (\Delta L_{cont.})^{\frac{3}{2}}$. Since
this dependency is prominently expressed in the narrow line emission it implies
that the luminosity dominating part of the narrow line region must be very
compact with a size of the order of at least 10 light years. A comparison to

characteristics of a total of 61 broad and narrow line sources.

studies on the application of aluminum mirrors to a coronagraph. Cooled
reflective optics is required for broad-band mid-infrared observations in

coronagraph instrument originally proposed for the next-generation infrared
astronomical satellite project SPICA (SCI: SPICA Coronagraph Instrument), we
fabricated and evaluated the optics consisting of high-precision aluminum
off-axis mirrors with diamond-turned surfaces, and conducted a coronagraphic
demonstration experiment using the optics with a coronagraph mask. We first
measured the wave front errors (WFEs) of the aluminum mirrors with a He-Ne
Fizeau interferometer to confirm that the power spectral densities of the WFEs
satisfy the SCI requirements. Then we integrated the mirrors into an optical
system and evaluated the overall performance of the system. As a result, we
estimate the total WFE of the optics to be 33 nm (rms), each mirror
contributing 10-20 nm (rms) for the central 14 mm area of the optics, and
obtain a contrast of 10^(-5.4) as a coronagraph in the visible light. At a
wavelength of 5 um, the coronagraphic system is expected to achieve a contrast
of ~10^(-7) based on our model calculation with the measured optical
performance. Thus our experiment demonstrates that aluminum mirror optics is
applicable to a highly WFE-sensitive instrument such as a coronagraph in space.

introduce risks in narrow spaces. In this paper, we introduce a novel setup of
self-supervised learning (SSL), in which optical flow cues serve as a scaffold
to learn the visual appearance of obstacles in the environment. We apply it to
a landing task, in which initially 'surface roughness' is estimated from the
optical flow field in order to detect obstacles. Subsequently, a linear
regression function is learned that maps appearance features represented by
texton distributions to the roughness estimate. After learning, the MAV can
detect obstacles by just analyzing a still image. This allows the MAV to search
for a landing spot without moving. We first demonstrate this principle to work
with offline tests involving images captured from an on-board camera, and then
demonstrate the principle in flight. Although surface roughness is a property
of the entire flow field in the global image, the appearance learning even
allows for the pixel-wise segmentation of obstacles.

algorithm design for secure multiuser wireless communication systems employing

multi-objective optimization framework to study two conflicting yet desirable
design objectives, i.e., total DL transmit power minimization and total UL
transmit power minimization. To this end, the weighed Tchebycheff method is
adopted to formulate the resource allocation algorithm design as a
multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). The considered MOOP takes into
account the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of all legitimate users for
guaranteeing secure DL and UL transmission in the presence of potential
eavesdroppers. Thereby, secure UL transmission is enabled by the FD BS and
would not be possible with an HD BS. The imperfectness of the channel state
information of the eavesdropping channels and the inter-user interference
channels is incorporated for robust resource allocation algorithm design.
Although the considered MOOP is non-convex, we solve it optimally by
semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Simulation results not only unveil
the trade-off between the total DL transmit power and the total UL transmit
power, but also confirm the robustness of the proposed algorithm against
potential eavesdroppers.

diffusion regimes of GBPs and the associated longitudinal magnetic field
strengths. Two high resolution observations of different magnetized
environments were acquired with the Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope. Each
observation was recorded simultaneously with G-band filtergrams and Narrow-band
Filter Imager (NFI) Stokes I and V images. GBPs are identified and tracked
automatically, and then categorized into several groups by their longitudinal
magnetic field strengths, which are extracted from the calibrated NFI
magnetograms using a point-by-point method. The Lagrangian approach and the
distribution of diffusion indices approach are adopted separately to explore
the diffusion regime of GBPs for each group. It is found that the values of
diffusion index and diffusion coefficient both decrease exponentially with the
increasing longitudinal magnetic field strengths whichever approach is used.
The empirical formulas deduced from the fitting equations are proposed to
describe these relations. Stronger elements tend to diffuse more slowly than
weak elements, independently of the magnetic flux of the surrounding medium.
This may be because the magnetic energy of stronger elements is not negligible
compared with the kinetic energy of the gas, and therefore the flows cannot
perturb them so easily.Yang

discrete models of quantum gravity for arbitrary dimensions. Among them, the
canonical tensor model (CTM for short) is a rank-three tensor model formulated
as a totally constrained system with a number of first-class constraints, which
have a similar algebraic structure as the constraints of the ADM formalism of
general relativity. In this paper, we formulate a super-extension of CTM as an
attempt to incorporate fermionic degrees of freedom. The kinematical symmetry
group is extended from $O(N)$ to $OSp(N,\tilde N)$, and the constraints are
constructed so that they form a first-class constraint super-Poisson algebra.
This is a straightforward super-extension, and the constraints and their
algebraic structure are formally unchanged from the purely bosonic case, except
for the additional signs associated to the order of the fermionic indices and
dynamical variables. However, this extension of CTM leads to the existence of
negative norm states in the quantized case, and requires some future
improvements as quantum gravity with fermions. On the other hand, since this is
a straightforward super-extension, various results obtained so far for the
purely bosonic case are expected to have parallels also in the super-extended
case, such as the exact physical wave functions and the connection to the dual
statistical systems, i.e. randomly connected tensor networks.

recruitment is a major challenge in fisheries science. Our current inability to
anticipate recruitment failures has led to costly management actions and in
some cases complete fishery collapse. Time series observations of fish
recruitment reflect an interplay of underlying population processes,
environmental forcing, measurement error, and process error. Given that the
error component is often very strong, an important unresolved question is
whether any non-random signal can be uncovered in the annual fluctuations of
recruitment time series. Here, we address this fundamental question in an
analysis of 569 fish populations from a global database of recruitment. Using a
nonparametric time series analysis method, we find overwhelming evidence for
non-random dynamics operating in the recruitment process. Unlike previous
explorations of this topic, our approach does not require the specification of
a stock-recruitment model, and it can be used on recruitment estimates derived
from a wide-range of abundance estimation methods. The evidence for
non-randomness is robust across a wide range of fish families and abundance
estimation methods. We also find that the statistical support for
non-randomness increases consistently with the number of observations of a fish
stock. This result provides the encouraging news that with continued
observations, and the appropriate covariates, we should ultimately be able to
uncover the mechanistic drivers of fish recruitment.

quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in solar flare lightcurves. We propose an
inversion scheme that consistently uses their periods $P$ and damping times
$\tau$ to diagnose flare loop parameters. We derive a generic dispersion
relation governing linear sausage waves in pressure-less straight tubes, for
which the transverse density inhomogeneity takes place in a layer of arbitrary
width $l$ and is of arbitrary form. We find that $P$ and $\tau$ depend on the
combination of $[R/v_{\rm Ai}, L/R, l/R, \rho_{\rm i}/\rho_{\rm e}]$, where $R$
is the loop radius, $L$ is the looplength, $v_{\rm Ai}$ is the internal
Alfv\'en speed, and $\rho_{\rm i}/\rho_{\rm e}$ is the density contrast. For
all the density profiles examined, $P$ and $\tau$ experience saturation when
$L/R \gg 1$, yielding an inversion curve in the $[R/v_{\rm Ai}, l/R, \rho_{\rm
i}/\rho_{\rm e}]$ space with a specific density profile when $L/R$ is
sufficiently large. When applied to a spatially unresolved QPP event, the
scheme yields that $R/v_{\rm Ai}$ is the best constrained, whereas $l/R$
corresponds to the other extreme. For spatially resolved QPPs, while $L/R \gg
1$ cannot be assumed beforehand, an inversion curve remains possible due to
additional geometrical constraints. When a spatially resolved QPP event
involves another mode, as is the case for a recent event, the full set of
$[v_{\rm Ai}, l, \rho_{\rm i}/\rho_{\rm e}]$ can be inferred. We conclude that
the proposed scheme provides a useful tool for magneto-seismologically
exploiting QPPs.

  Turbulent velocity fluctuations significantly enhances velocity differences
between colliding droplets, especially those having small sizes. As a result
drizzle forms faster in simulations including a representation of turbulence.
Both representations of turbulent velocity fluctuations, random walk and
interpolation, have similar effect on droplet spectrum evolution, but
interpolation of the velocity does account for a possible anisotropy in the air
velocity.
  All discussed simulations show relatively large standard deviation

formation is observed. Because coalesence processes aerosol inside cloud
droplets, detail information about aerosol is available. Results from numerical
simulations show that changes in aerosol spectrum due to aerosol processing

compound URu2Si2 is an itinerant multipole order of high rank. It is due to the
pairing of electrons and holes centered on zone center and boundary,
respectively in states that have maximally different total angular momentum
components. Due to the pairing with commensurate zone boundary ordering vector
the translational symmetry is broken and a HO quasiparticle gap opens below the
transition temperature T_HO. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) has
demonstrated that for T<T_HO the collective magnetic response is dominated by a
sharp spin exciton resonance at the ordering vector Q that is reminiscent of
spin exciton modes found inside the gap of unconventional superconductors and
Kondo insulators. We use an effective two-orbital tight binding model
incorporating the crystalline electric field effect to derive closed
expressions for quasiparticle bands reconstructed by the multipolar pairing
terms. We show that the magnetic response calculated within that model exhibits
the salient features of the resonance found in INS. We also use the calculated
dynamical susceptibility to explain the low temperature NMR relaxation rate.

radiatively broken through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, generating the mass

compared to the predictions of several recent libraries of stellar evolutionary

models best reproduce the observed RGB morphology, albeit with offsets in J-Ks
color which vary in their significance in light of all sources of observational

in every physiologically relevant system and often used as a measurement site
in experimental recordings, but it has received subordinate attention compared
to the intracellular domain. In computational modeling, it is often regarded as
a passive, homogeneous resistive medium with a constant conductivity, which
greatly simplifies the computation of extracellular potentials. However, recent
studies have shown that local ionic diffusion and capacitive effects of
electrically active membranes can have a substantial impact on the
extracellular potential. These effects can not be described by traditional
models, and they have been subject to theoretical and experimental analyses. We
strive to give an overview over recent progress in modeling the extracellular
space with special regard towards the concentration and potential dynamics on
different temporal and spatial scales. Three models with distinct assumptions
and levels of detail are compared both theoretically and by means of numerical
simulations: the classical volume conductor (VC) model, which is most
frequently used in form of the line source approximation (LSA); the very
detailed, but computationally intensive Poisson-Nernst-Planck model of
electrodiffusion (PNP); and an intermediate one called the electroneutral model
(EN). The results clearly show that there is no one model for all applications,
as they show significantly different responses especially close to neuronal
membranes. Finally, we list some common use cases for model simulations and
give recommendations on which model to use in each situation.

the competitiveness of countries and the quality of the exported products based
on the empirical observation that the most competitive countries have
diversified exports, whereas developing countries only export few low quality
products -- typically those exported by many other countries. Two different
metrics, Fitness-Complexity and the Method of Reflections, have been proposed
to measure country and product score in the Economic Complexity framework. We
use international trade data and a recent ranking evaluation measure to
quantitatively compare the ability of the two metrics to rank countries and
products according to their importance in the network. The results show that
the Fitness-Complexity metric outperforms the Method of Reflections in both the

Generalization of the Fitness-Complexity metric and show that it can produce
improved rankings provided that the input data are reliable.

  Let $\mu \ge \text{LS} (K)$. If $K$ is categorical in a $\lambda \ge

  Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, 2014",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With over 1800 planets discovered outside of the Solar System in the past two
decades, the field of exoplanetology has broadened our perspective on planetary
systems. Research priorities are now moving from planet detection to planet
characterization. In this context, transiting exoplanets are of special
interest due to the wealth of data made available by their orbital
configuration. Here, I introduce two methods to gain new insights into the
atmospheric and interior properties of exoplanets.
  The first method aims to map an exoplanet's atmosphere based on the scanning
obtained while it is occulted by its host star. I introduce the basics of
eclipse mapping, its caveats, and a framework to mitigate their effects via
global analyses including transits, phase curves, and radial velocity
measurements. I use this method to create the first 2D map and the first cloud
map of an exoplanet for the hot-Jupiters HD189733b and Kepler-7b, respectively.
Ultimately temperature, composition, and circulation patterns could be
constrained in 3D, a significant asset for informing atmospheric models.
  The second method, MassSpec, aims to determine transiting planet masses and
atmospheric properties solely from transmission spectra. Determination of an
exoplanet's mass is key to understanding its basic properties, including its
potential for supporting life. To date, mass constraints for exoplanets are
mainly based on radial velocity measurements, which are not suited for planets
with low masses, large semi-major axes, or those orbiting faint or active
stars. I demonstrate that a planet's mass has to be accounted for by
atmospheric retrieval methods to avoid biases and that JWST could determine the
mass and atmospheric properties of half a dozen Earth-sized planets in their
host's habitable zones over its lifetime, which could lead to the first
identification of a habitable exoplanet.

been built at the Tunka site, e.g., a scintillator array named Tunka-Grande, a
sophisticated air-Cherenkov-detector prototype named HiSCORE, and the radio
extension Tunka-Rex. Tunka-Rex started operation in October 2012 and currently
features 44 antennas distributed over an area of about $3\,$km$^2$, which
measure the radio emission of the same air showers detected by Tunka-133 and
Tunka-Grande. Tunka-Rex is a technological demonstrator that the radio
technique can provide an economic extension of existing air-shower arrays. The
main scientific goal is the cross-calibration with the air-Cherenkov
measurements. By this cross-calibration, the precision for the reconstruction
of the energy and mass of the primary cosmic-ray particles can be determined.
Finally, Tunka-Rex can be used for cosmic-ray physics at energies close to
$1\,$EeV, where the standard Tunka-133 analysis is limited by statistics. In
contrast to the air-Cherenkov measurements, radio measurements are not limited
to dark, clear nights and can provide an order of magnitude larger exposure.

driven by the irreconcilability of opposing sets of beliefs, ideologies, and
religious dogmas. The dynamics of belief systems has been studied mainly from
two distinct perspectives, namely how cognitive biases lead to individual
belief rigidity and how social influence leads to social conformity. Here we
propose a unifying framework that connects cognitive and social forces together
in order to study the dynamics of societal belief evolution. Each individual is
endowed with a network of interacting beliefs that evolves through interaction
with other individuals in a social network. The adoption of beliefs is affected
by both internal coherence and social conformity. Our framework explains how
social instabilities can arise in otherwise homogeneous populations, how small
numbers of zealots with highly coherent beliefs can overturn societal
consensus, and how belief rigidity protects fringe groups and cults against
invasion from mainstream beliefs, allowing them to persist and even thrive in
larger societies. Our results suggest that strong consensus may be insufficient
to guarantee social stability, that the cognitive coherence of belief-systems
is vital in determining their ability to spread, and that coherent
belief-systems may pose a serious problem for resolving social polarization,
due to their ability to prevent consensus even under high levels of social
exposure. We therefore argue that the inclusion of cognitive factors into a
social model is crucial in providing a more complete picture of collective
human dynamics.

long-range phase coherence set in simultaneously at the CDW transition
temperature T$_{cdw}$. Here we investigate, using photoemission, X-ray
scattering and scanning tunneling microscopy, the canonical CDW compound
2H-NbSe$_2$ intercalated with Mn and Co, and show that the conventional view is
untenable. We find that, either at high temperature or at large intercalation,
CDW order becomes short-ranged with a well-defined amplitude that impacts the
electronic dispersion, giving rise to an energy gap. The phase transition at
T$_{cdw}$ marks the onset of long-range order with global phase coherence,
leading to sharp electronic excitations. Our observations emphasize the
importance of phase fluctuations in strongly coupled CDW systems and provide
insights into the significance of phase incoherence in `pseudogap' states.

operators in a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, joining endpoints $A_\pm$ as $t \to

$L^2(\mathbb{R}; \mathcal{H})$, where $A = \int_{\mathbb{R}}^{\oplus} dt \,
A(t)$, and its relation to spectral flow along this path, has a long history.
While most of the latter focuses on the case where $A(t)$ all have purely
discrete spectrum, we now particularly study situations permitting essential
spectra.
  Introducing $H_1={D_A}^* D_A$ and $H_2=D_A {D_A}^*$, we consider spectral
shift functions $\xi(\, \cdot \,; A_+, A_-)$ and $\xi(\, \cdot \, ; H_2, H_1)$
associated with the pairs $(A_+, A_-)$ and $(H_2,H_1)$. Assuming $A_+$ to be a
relatively trace class perturbation of $A_-$ and $A_{\pm}$ to be Fredholm, the
value $\xi(0; A_-, A_+)$ was shown in [14] to represent the spectral flow along
the path $\{A(t)\}_{t\in \mathbb{R}}$ while that of $\xi(0_+; H_1,H_2)$ yields
the Fredholm index of $D_A$. The fact, proved in [14], that these values of the
two spectral functions are equal, resolves the index = spectral flow question
in this case.
  When the path $\{A(t)\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ consists of differential
operators, the relatively trace class perturbation assumption is violated. The
simplest assumption that applies (to differential operators in
(1+1)-dimensions) is a relatively Hilbert-Schmidt perturbation. This is not
just an incremental improvement. In fact, the approximation method we employ
here to make this extension is of interest in any dimension. Moreover we
consider $A_\pm$ which are not necessarily Fredholm and we establish that the
relationships between the two spectral shift functions for the pairs $(A_+,
A_-)$ and $(H_2,H_1)$ found in all of the previous papers [9], [14], and [22]
can be proved in the non-Fredholm case.
