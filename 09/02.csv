such as axions, axion-like particles and hidden photons could be detected using
reflective surfaces. On such reflectors some of the dark matter particles are
converted into photons and, given a suitable geometry, concentrated on the
detector. This technique offers sensitivity to the direction of the velocity of
the dark matter particles. In this note we investigate how far spherical
mirrors can concentrate the generated photons and what this implies for the

utilize its true source: the sale and purchase curves of the electricity
exchange. We will refer to this new model as X-Model, as almost every
deregulated electricity price is simply the result of the intersection of the
electricity supply and demand curve at a certain auction. Therefore we show an
approach to deal with a tremendous amount of auction data, using a subtle data
processing technique as well as dimension reduction and lasso based estimation
methods. We incorporate not only several known features, such as seasonal
behavior or the impact of other processes like renewable energy, but also
completely new elaborated stylized facts of the bidding structure. Our model is
able to capture the non-linear behavior of the electricity price, which is
especially useful for predicting huge price spikes. Using simulation methods we
show how to derive prediction intervals for probabilistic forecasting. We
describe and show the proposed methods for the day-ahead EPEX spot price of

Taking full advantages of above two cloud-based techniques, C-RAN with MCC are
presented in this paper to enhance both performance and energy efficiencies. In
particular, this paper studies the joint energy minimization and resource
allocation in C-RAN with MCC under the time constraints of the given tasks. We
first review the energy and time model of the computation and communication.
Then, we formulate the joint energy minimization into a non-convex optimization
with the constraints of task executing time, transmitting power, computation
capacity and fronthaul data rates. This non-convex optimization is then
reformulated into an equivalent convex problem based on weighted minimum mean

confirm that the proposed energy minimization and resource allocation solution

the system consisting of a ferromagnetic insulator in a direct contact with a
nonmagnetic metal, and the sandwich structure consisting of a ferromagnetic
insulating part sandwiched between two nonmagnetic metals. It is shown that
when the difference between the temperatures of the two nonmagnetic metals in a
structure is not large, the spin pumping currents from the magnetic part to the
nonmagnetic ones are equal in amplitude and have opposite directions, so only
the spin torque current contributes to the total spin current. The spin current
flows then from the nonmagnetic metal with the higher temperature to the
nonmagnetic metal having a lower temperature. Its amplitude varies linearly
with the difference in temperatures. In addition, we have found that if the
magnetic anisotropy is in the layer plane, then the spin current increases with
the magnon temperature, while in the case of an out-of-plane magnetic
anisotropy the spin current decreases when the magnon temperature enhances.
Enlarging the difference between the temperatures of the nonmagnetic metals,
the linear response becomes important, as confirmed by analytical expressions
inferred from the Fokker-Planck approach and by the results obtained upon a
full numerical integration of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.

Alfven-wave-driven turbulence for three typical open magnetic field structures:
a polar coronal hole, an open flux tube neighboring an equatorial streamer, and
an open flux tube near a strong-field active region. We compare time-steady,
one-dimensional turbulent heating models (Cranmer et al., 2007) against fully
time-dependent three-dimensional reduced-magnetohydrodynamics modeling of BRAID
(van Ballegooijen et al., 2011). We find that the time-steady results agree
well with time-averaged results from BRAID. The time-dependence allows us to
investigate the variability of the magnetic fluctuations and of the heating in
the corona. The high-frequency tail of the power spectrum of fluctuations forms
a power law whose exponent varies with height, and we discuss the possible
physical explanation for this behavior. The variability in the heating rate is
bursty and nanoflare-like in nature, and we analyze the amount of energy lost
via dissipative heating in transient events throughout the simulation. The
average energy in these events is 10^21.91 erg, within the ""picoflare"" range,
and many events reach classical ""nanoflare"" energies. We also estimated the
multithermal distribution of temperatures that would result from the
heating-rate variability, and found good agreement with observed widths of
coronal differential emission measure (DEM) distributions. The results of the
modeling presented in this paper provide compelling evidence that turbulent
heating in the solar atmosphere by Alfven waves accelerates the solar wind in
open flux tubes.

Reconstruction techniques like Pyle, Power law and Weibull are adopted as
standard to quantify the erupted mass (or volume) whereas Voronoi for
reconstructing the granulometry. Reconstructed values can be affected by large
uncertainty due to complexities occurring within the atmospheric dispersion and
deposition of volcanic particles. Here we want to quantify the sensitivity of
reconstruction techniques, and to quantify how much estimated values of mass
and grain size differ from emitted and deposited ones. We adopted a numerical
approach simulating with a dispersal code a mild explosive event occurring at
Mt. Etna, with eruptive parameters similar to those estimated for eruptions
occurred in the last decade. Then we created a synthetic deposit by integrating
the mass on the ground computed by the model over the computational domain
(>50000 km2). Multiple samplings of the simulated deposit are used for
generating a large dataset of sampling tests afterwards processed with standard
reconstruction techniques. Results are then compared and evaluated through a
statistical analysis, based on 2000 sampling tests of 100 samplings points. On
average, all the used techniques underestimate deposited and emitted mass. A
similar analysis, carried on Voronoi results, shows that information on the
total grain size distribution is strongly deteriorated. Here we present a new
method allowing an estimate of the deficiency in deposited mass for each
simulated class. Finally a sensitivity study on eruptive parameters is
presented in order to generalize our results to a wider range of eruptive

Markov chains whose transition rates are themselves Markov processes. In one
set of problems the solution of an ordinary differential equation is shown to
determine the optimal performance and feedback controls, while some other cases
are shown to lead to singular optimal control problems which are more difficult
to solve. Solution techniques are demonstrated using examples from finance to
behavioral decision making.

physics experiments regarding the nature of light, including ""which-way""
determination of light particles, N. Bohr's complementarity principle, or the
EPR paradox and all their measurement apparatus. Although they look as common
optical components at first glance, their behaviour remains somewhat mysterious
since they apparently exhibit stand-alone particle-like features, and then
wave-like characteristics when inserted into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In
this communication are examined and discussed some basic properties of these
beamssplitters, both from a classical optics and quantum physics point of view.
Herein some convergences and contradictions are highlighted, and the results of
a few emblematic experiments demonstrating photon existence are discussed. An
alternative empirical model in wave optics is also proposed in order to shed
light on some remaining questions

filters. We show that by keeping track of certain key features of the
genealogical structure arising from resampling operations, it is possible to
estimate variances of a number of standard Monte Carlo approximations which
particle filters deliver. All our estimators can be computed from a single run
of a particle filter with no further simulation. We establish that as the
number of particles grows, our estimators are weakly consistent for asymptotic
variances of the Monte Carlo approximations and some of them are also
non-asymptotically unbiased. The asymptotic variances can be decomposed into
terms corresponding to each time step of the algorithm, and we show how to
consistently estimate each of these terms. When the number of particles may
vary over time, this allows approximation of the asymptotically optimal
allocation of particle numbers.

dynamics of functionalized (patchy) colloids adsorbed on an attractive
substrate. Kinetically arrested structures that depend on the number of
adsorbed particles and the strength of the particle-particle and
particle-substrate interactions are identified. The radial distribution
function is characterized by a sequence of peaks, with relative intensities
that depend on the number of adsorbed particles. The first-layer coverage is a
non-monotonic function of the number of particles, with an optimal value around
one layer of adsorbed particles. The initial relaxation towards these
structures is characterized by a fast (exponential) and a slow (power-law)
dynamics. The fast relaxation timescale is a linearly increasing function of
the number of adsorbed particles in the submonolayer regime, but it saturates
for more than one adsorbed layer. The slow dynamics exhibits two characteristic
exponents, depending on the surface coverage.

  State in NiS2","22 pages",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the early triumphs of quantum physics is the explanation why some
materials are metallic whereas others are insulating. While a treatment based
on single electron states correctly predicts the character of most materials
this approach can fail spectacularly, when the electrostatic repulsion between
electrons causes strong correlations. Not only can these favor new and subtle
forms of order in metals, such as magnetism or superconductivity, they can even
cause the electrons in a half-filled energy band to lock into position
altogether, producing a correlated, or Mott insulator. Arguably the most
extreme manifestation of electronic correlations in dense electronic matter,
the transition into the Mott insulating state raises a number of fundamental
questions. Foremost among these is the fate of the electronic Fermi surface and
the associated charge carrier mass, as the Mott transition is approached at low
temperature, which have been particularly controversial in the high temperature
superconducting cuprates. We report the first direct observation of the Fermi
surface on the metallic side of a Mott insulating transition by high pressure
quantum oscillatory measurements in NiS2. Our results point at a large Fermi
surface consistent with Luttinger's theorem and a strongly enhanced carrier
effective mass, suggesting that electron localization occurs via a diverging
effective mass and concomitant slowing down of charge carriers as predicted
theoretically.

guide and validate the design process, analytical expressions of key
performance metrics such as packet reception probabilities and throughput are
necessary, in particular for accident-prone scenarios such as intersections. In
this paper, we analyze the impact of interference in an intersection scenario
with two perpendicular roads using tools from stochastic geometry. We present a
general procedure to analytically determine the packet reception probability
and throughput of a selected link, taking into account the geographical
clustering of vehicles close to the intersection. We consider both Aloha and
CSMA MAC protocols, and show how the procedure can be used to model different
propagation environments of practical relevance. We show how different path
loss functions and fading distributions can be incorporated in the analysis to
model propagation conditions typical to both rural and urban intersections. Our
results indicate that the procedure is general and flexible to deal with a
variety of scenarios. Thus, it can serve as a useful design tool for
communication system engineers, complementing simulations and experiments, to
obtain quick insights into the network performance.

corresponding inelastic scattering spectra are studied based on the
hydrodynamic approach. Along with the bulk losses traditionally taken into
account, the surface and radiative ones are also considered as the physical
mechanisms responsible for the plasmon damping. The second and third mechanisms
are found to be essential for the surface plasmons and depend very differently
on the multipole mode order. The differential equations are obtained which
describe the temporal evolution of every particular mode as that one of a
linear oscillator excited by the given external force, and the electron energy
loss spectra are calculated. The changes in spectrum shape with the impact
parameter and with the electron passage time are analyzed and found to be in
good enough agreement with the data of scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) experiments. It is shown that, in the general case, a
pronounced contribution to the formation of the loss spectrum is given by the
both surface and volume plasmons with low and high multipole indices. In
particular, at long electron passage time, the integral loss spectrum which is
calculated for the free-electron cluster model contains two main peaks: a broad
peak from merging of many high-order multipole resonances of the surface
plasmons and a narrower peak of nearly the same height from merged volume
plasmons excited by the electrons that travel through the central region of the
cluster. Comparatively complex dependences of the calculated excitation
coefficients and damping constants of various plasmons on the order of the
excited multipole result in wide diversity of possible types of the loss
spectrum even for the same cluster material and should be taken into account in
interpretation of corresponding electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)
experiments.

technological and biological networks has moved the focus of the physics of
complex systems towards a multiplex description of the interactions between
their constituents. This novel approach has unveiled that the multiplex nature
of complex systems has strong influence in the emergence of collective states
and their critical properties. Here we address an important issue that is
intrinsic to the coexistence of multiple means of interactions within a
network: their competition. To this aim, we study a two-layer multiplex in
which the activity of users can be localized in each of the layer or shared
between them, favoring that neighboring nodes within a layer focus their
activity on the same layer. This framework mimics the coexistence and
competition of multiple communication channels, in a way that the prevalence of
a particular communication platform emerges as a result of the localization of
users activity in one single interaction layer. Our results indicate that there
is a transition from localization (use of a preferred layer) to delocalization
(combined usage of both layers) and that the prevalence of a particular layer
(in the localized state) depends on their structural properties.

all internal and system-environment couplings. We propose dynamical decoupling
schemes, that use only bounded-strength controls, for quantum many-body systems
with local system Hamiltonians and local environmental couplings. To do so, we
introduce the combinatorial concept of balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays (BOAs)
and show how to construct them from classical error-correcting codes. The
derived decoupling schemes may be useful as a primitive for more complex
schemes, e.g., for Hamiltonian simulation. For the case of $n$ qubits and a
$2$-local Hamiltonian, the length of the resulting decoupling scheme scales as
$O(n \log n)$, improving over the previously best-known schemes that scaled
quadratically with $n$. More generally, using balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays
constructed from families of BCH codes, we show that bounded-strength
decoupling for any $\ell$-local Hamiltonian, where $\ell \geq 2$, can be
achieved using decoupling schemes of length at most $O(n^{\ell-1} \log n)$.

  We present a general framework for constructing program synthesizers that
take natural language (NL) inputs and produce expressions in a target DSL. The
framework takes as input a DSL definition and training data consisting of
NL/DSL pairs. From these it constructs a synthesizer by learning optimal

applications such as the selection of plants and animals of commercial
interest; and it is expected to play an increasing role in medical diagnostics.
Statistical models used for this task are usually tested using
cross-validation, which implicitly assumes that new individuals (whose
phenotypes we would like to predict) originate from the same population the
genomic prediction model is trained on. In this paper we propose an approach
based on clustering and resampling to investigate the effect of increasing
genetic distance between training and target populations when predicting
quantitative traits. This is important for plant and animal genetics, where
genomic selection programs rely on the precision of predictions in future
rounds of breeding. Therefore, estimating how quickly predictive accuracy
decays is important in deciding which training population to use and how often
the model has to be recalibrated. We find that the correlation between true and
predicted values decays approximately linearly with respect to either $\F$ or
mean kinship between the training and the target populations. We illustrate
this relationship using simulations and a collection of data sets from mice,
wheat and human genetics.

characterized, and its variability has been monitored, through continuous
near-infrared spectroscopic observations. But in the visible range only few
data are available. Aims. The aim of this work is to define the Pluto's
relative reflectance in the visible range to characterize the different
components of its surface, and to provide ground based observations in support
of the New Horizons mission. Methods. We observed Pluto on six nights between
May and July 2014, with the imager/spectrograph ACAM at the William Herschel
Telescope (La Palma, Spain). The six spectra obtained cover a whole rotation of
Pluto (Prot = 6.4 days). For all the spectra we computed the spectral slope and
the depth of the absorption bands of methane ice between 0.62 and 0.90 $\mu$m.
To search for shifts of the center of the methane bands, associated with
dilution of CH4 in N2, we compared the bands with reflectances of pure methane
ice. Results. All the new spectra show the methane ice absorption bands between
0.62 and 0.90 $\mu$m. The computation of the depth of the band at 0.62 $\mu$m
in the new spectra of Pluto, and in the spectra of Makemake and Eris from the
literature, allowed us to estimate the Lambert coefficient at this wavelength,
at a temperature of 30 K and 40 K, never measured before. All the detected
bands are blue shifted, with minimum shifts in correspondence with the regions
where the abundance of methane is higher. This could be indicative of a
dilution of CH4:N2 more saturated in CH4. The longitudinal and secular
variations of the parameters measured in the spectra are in accordance with
results previously reported in the literature and with the distribution of the
dark and bright material that show the Pluto's albedo maps from New Horizons.

on the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation in an arbitrary free energy
landscape including a general inhomogeneous diffusivity profile. The transition
path ensemble is the collection of all paths that do not revisit the start
position $x_A$ and that terminate when first reaching the final position $x_B$.
In contrast, a first-passage path can revisit but not cross its start position
$x_A$ before it terminates at $x_B$. Our theoretical framework employs the
forward and backward Fokker-Planck equations as well as first-passage, passage,
last-passage and transition-path time distributions, for which we derive the
defining integral equations. We show that the mean time at which the transition
path ensemble visits an intermediate position $x$ is equivalent to the mean
first-passage time of reaching the starting position $x_A$ from $x$ without
ever visiting $x_B$. The mean shape of first-passage paths is related to the
mean shape of transition paths by a constant time shift. Since for large
barrier height $U$ the mean first-passage time scales exponentially in $U$
while the mean transition path time scales linearly inversely in $U$, the time
shift between first-passage and transition path shapes is substantial. We
present explicit examples of transition path shapes for linear and harmonic
potentials and illustrate our findings by trajectories generated from Brownian
dynamics simulations.

on approximations of a complete solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The
natural question that we address in this paper is how these two topics

an uncountable field also answers a recent question by Zelmanov.
  In [38], Rump introduced braces and radical chains $A^{n+1}=A\cdot A^{n}$ and
$A^{(n+1)}=A^{(n)}\cdot A$ of a brace $A$. We show that the adjoint group
$A^{o}$ of a finite right brace is a nilpotent group if and only if $A^{(n)}=0$

  We also show that the adjoint group of $A^{o}$ of a finite left brace $A$ is
a nilpotent group if and only if
  $A^{n}=0$ for some $n$. Moreover, if $A^{o}$ is a nilpotent group then
  $A$ is the direct sum of braces whose cardinatities are powers of prime
numbers. Notice that $A^{o}$ is sometimes called the multiplicative group of a
brace $A$ (for example in [13]).
  We also introduce a chain of ideals $A^{[n]}$ of a left brace $A$ and then
use it to investigate braces which satisfy $A^{n}=0$ and $A^{(m)}=0$ for some
$m, n$ (Theorems 2, 3).
  In Section 2 we describe connections between our results and braided groups
and the Yang-Baxter equation.

rocky planets due to the negative climate feedbacks involved in silicate
weathering. Plate tectonics plays a crucial role in driving the long-term
carbon cycle because it is responsible for CO$_2$ degassing at ridges and arcs,
the return of CO$_2$ to the mantle through subduction, and supplying fresh,
weatherable rock to the surface via uplift and orogeny. However, the presence
of plate tectonics itself may depend on climate according to recent
geodynamical studies showing that cool surface temperatures are important for
maintaining vigorous plate tectonics. Using a simple carbon cycle model, I show
that the negative climate feedbacks inherent in the long-term carbon cycle are
uninhibited by climate's effect on plate tectonics. Furthermore, initial
atmospheric CO$_2$ conditions do not impact the final climate state reached
when the carbon cycle comes to equilibrium, as long as liquid water is present
and silicate weathering can occur. Thus an initially hot, CO$_2$ rich
atmosphere does not prevent the development of a temperate climate and plate
tectonics on a planet. However, globally supply-limited weathering does prevent
the development of temperate climates on planets with small subaerial land
areas and large total CO$_2$ budgets because supply-limited weathering lacks
stabilizing climate feedbacks. Planets in the supply-limited regime may become
inhospitable for life and could experience significant water loss.
Supply-limited weathering is less likely on plate tectonic planets, because
plate tectonics promotes high erosion rates and thus a greater supply of
bedrock to the surface.

the variation of the interpolation angle, we inspect the whole landscape of the
generalized helicity intermediating between the usual Jacob-Wick helicity in
the IFD and the light-front helicity in the LFD. Our analysis clarifies the
characteristic difference of the helicity amplitudes between the IFD and the
LFD. In particular, we find that the behavior of the angle between the momentum
direction and the spin direction bifurcates at a critical interpolation angle

bifurcated at this critical interpolation angle. This finding further clarifies
any conceivable confusion in the prevailing notion of the equivalence between
the infinite momentum frame and the LFD. The existence of the universal J-curve
found in our previous works of scalar field theory and the sQED theory is

and their products are simulated in SOSpin through the implementation of
doubly-linked-list data structures. These data structures were determinant to
achieve a higher performance in the simplification of large products of
creation and annihilation operators. We illustrate the use of our library with
complete examples of how to decompose Yukawa terms invariant under SO(2N) in
terms of SU(N) degrees of freedom for N=2 and 5. We further demonstrate, with
an example for SO(4), that higher dimensional field-operator terms can also be
processed with our library. Finally, we describe the functions available in
SOSpin that are made to simplify the writing of spinors and their interactions
specifically for SO(10) models.

This is the main problem in its production

entanglement of a bi-partite system described by $d\times d$ Hilbert space. Our
analysis uses a geometric approach based on the fact that if a scalar product
of a vector $\vec{s}$ with a vector $\vec {e}$ is less than the square of the
norm of $\vec{e}$, then $\vec{s}\neq\vec{e}$. We use such concepts for
correlation tensors of separable and entangled states. As a general form
correlation tensors for pairs of qudits, for $d>2$, is very difficult to
obtain, because one does not have a Bloch sphere for pure one qudit states, we
use a simplified approach. The criterion reads: if the largest Schmidt
eigenvalue of a correlation tensor is smaller than the square of its norm, then
the state is entangled. this criterion is applied in the case of various types
of noise admixtures to the initial (pure) state. These include white noise,
colored noise, local depolarizing noise and amplitude damping noise. A broad
set of numerical and analytical results is presented. As the other simple
criterion for entanglement is violation of Bell's inequalities, we also find
critical noise parameters to violate specific family of Bell inequalities
(CGLMP), for maximally entangled states. We give analytical forms of our
results for $d$ approaching infinity.

no bound states in 6 dimensions but are bound through KK momenta when wrapping
a circle, as well as loci where the curves degenerate to spheres. These loci
lead to black hole configurations which can have total angular momentum
relative to a Taub-Nut center satisfying $J^2 > M^3$ and whose number of
states, though exponentially large, grows much slower than those of the large
spinning black hole.

delay, multiple camera views are sent to the users, which are used as reference

In practice, bandwidth constraints may however restrict the number of reference

synthesized viewpoints. We argue that the reference view selection should
ideally be performed close to the users, and we study the problem of in-network
reference view synthesis such that the navigation quality is maximized at the
clients. We consider a distributed cloud network architecture where data stored
in a main cloud is delivered to end users with the help of cloudlets, i.e.,
resource-rich proxies close to the users. In order to satisfy last-hop
bandwidth constraints from the cloudlet to the users, a cloudlet re-samples
viewpoints of the 3D scene into a discrete set of views (combination of
received camera views and virtual views synthesized) to be used as reference
for the synthesis of additional virtual views at the client. This in-network
synthesis leads to better viewpoint sampling given a bandwidth constraint
compared to simple selection of camera views, but it may however carry a
distortion penalty in the cloudlet-synthesized reference views. We therefore
cast a new reference view selection problem where the best subset of views is
defined as the one minimizing the distortion over a view navigation window
defined by the user under some transmission bandwidth constraints. We show that
the view selection problem is NP-hard, and propose an effective polynomial time
algorithm using dynamic programming to solve the optimization problem.
Simulation results finally confirm the performance gain offered by virtual view
synthesis in the network.

We show here that when calculating universal properties of Renyi entropies, it
is important to account for unusual corrections to scaling that arise from
relevant local operators present at the conical singularity in the
multi-sheeted Riemann surface. These corrections grow in importance with
increasing Renyi index. We present studies of Renyi correlation functions in
the 1+1 transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) using conformal field theory,
mapping to free fermions, and series expansions, and the logarithmic entropy
singularity at a corner in 2+1 for both free bosonic field theory and the TFIM,
using numerical linked cluster expansions. In all numerical studies, accurate
results are only obtained when unusual corrections to scaling are taken into
account. In the worst case, an analysis ignoring these corrections can get
qualitatively incorrect answers, such as predicting a decrease in critical
exponents with the Renyi index, when they are actually increasing. We discuss a
two-step extrapolation procedure that can be used to account for the unusual
corrections to scaling.

stellar-mass surface densities, in star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Since
z=3, both populations occupy distinct, linear relations in log(Sigma_e) and
log(Sigma_1) vs. log(M). These structural relations exhibit slopes and scatter
that remain almost constant with time while their normalizations decline. For
SFGs, the normalization declines by less than a factor of 2 from z=3, in both
Sigma_e and Sigma_1. Such mild declines suggest that SFGs build dense cores by
growing along these relations. We define this evolution as the structural main
sequence (Sigma-MS). Quiescent galaxies follow different relations (Sigma^Q_e,
Sigma^Q_1) off the Sigma-MS by having higher densities than SFGs of the same
mass and redshift. The normalization of Sigma^Q_e declines by a factor of 10
since z=3, but only a factor of 2 in Sigma^Q_1. Thus, the common denominator
for quiescent galaxies at all redshifts is the presence of a dense stellar
core, and the formation of such cores in SFGs is the main requirement for
quenching. Expressed in 2D as deviations off the SFR-MS and off Sigma^Q_1 at
each redshift, the distribution of massive galaxies forms a universal, L-shaped
sequence that relates two fundamental physical processes: compaction and
quenching. Compaction is a process of substantial core-growth in SFGs relative
to that in the Sigma-MS. This process increases the core-to-total mass and
Sersic index, thereby, making compact SFGs. Quenching occurs once compact SFGs
reach a maximum central density above Sigma^Q_1 > 9.5 M_sun/kpc^2. This
threshold provides the most effective selection criterion to identify the
star-forming progenitors of quiescent galaxies at all redshifts.

role in early-universe cosmology. However, many factors can significantly
impact their late-time cosmological abundances. For example, in cases where the
potentials for these fields are generated dynamically --- such as during
cosmological mass-generating phase transitions --- the duration of the time
interval required for these potentials to fully develop can have significant
repercussions. Likewise, in scenarios with multiple scalars, mixing amongst the
fields can also give rise to an effective timescale that modifies the resulting
late-time abundances. Previous studies have focused on the effects of either
the first or the second timescale in isolation. In this paper, by contrast, we
examine the new features that arise from the interplay between these two
timescales when both mixing and time-dependent phase transitions are introduced
together. First, we find that the effects of these timescales can conspire to
alter not only the total late-time abundance of the system --- often by many
orders of magnitude --- but also its distribution across the different fields.
Second, we find that these effects can produce large parametric resonances
which render the energy densities of the fields highly sensitive to the degree
of mixing as well as the duration of the time interval over which the phase
transition unfolds. Finally, we find that these effects can even give rise to a
""re-overdamping"" phenomenon which causes the total energy density of the system
to behave in novel ways that differ from those exhibited by pure dark matter or
vacuum energy. All of these features therefore give rise to new possibilities
for early-universe phenomenology and cosmological evolution. They also
highlight the importance of taking into account the time dependence associated
with phase transitions in cosmological settings.

we propose a statistical guide to the consistent treatment of the theoretical

approaches are systematically analysed in a unified formalism. We present
analytical expressions for the marginal likelihoods, useful to implement
simultaneously the experimental and theoretical uncertainties. We review the
various origins of the theoretical errors (QCD, EFT, PDF, production mode
contamination...). All these individual uncertainties are thoroughly combined
with the help of moment-based considerations. The theoretical correlations
among Higgs detection channels appear to affect the location and size of the
best-fit regions in the space of Higgs couplings. We discuss the recurrent
question of the shape of the prior distributions for the individual theoretical
errors and find that a nearly Gaussian prior arises from the error
combinations. We also develop the bias approach, which is an alternative to
marginalisation providing more conservative results. The statistical framework
to apply the bias principle is introduced and two realisations of the bias are
proposed. Finally, depending on the statistical treatment, the Standard Model
prediction for the Higgs signal strengths is found to lie within either the
$68\%$ or $95\%$ confidence level region obtained from the latest analyses of
the $7$ and $8$ TeV LHC datasets.

van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion interactions, is essential for describing the
structure, dynamics, and function of a wide variety of systems. Among the most
accurate models for including dispersion into density functional theory (DFT)
is the range-separated many-body dispersion (MBD) method [A. Ambrossetti et
al., J. Chem. Phys. 140, 18A508 (2014)], in which the correlation energy is
modeled at short-range by a semi-local density functional and at long-range by
a model system of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators. In this work, we
develop analytical gradients of the MBD energy with respect to nuclear
coordinates, including all implicit coordinate dependencies arising from the
partitioning of the charge density into Hirshfeld effective volumes. To
demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of these MBD gradients for geometry
optimizations of systems with intermolecular and intramolecular interactions,
we optimized conformers of the benzene dimer and isolated small peptides with
aromatic side-chains. We find excellent agreement with the wavefunction theory
reference geometries of these systems (at a fraction of the computational cost)
and find that MBD consistently outperforms the popular TS and D3(BJ) dispersion
corrections. To demonstrate the performance of the MBD model on a larger system
with supramolecular interactions, we optimized the C$_{60}$@C$_{60}$H$_{28}$
buckyball catcher host-guest complex. Finally, we find that neglecting the
implicit nuclear coordinate dependence arising from the charge density
partitioning, as has been done in prior numerical treatments, leads to an
unacceptable error in the MBD forces, with relative errors of ~20% (on average)
that can extend well beyond 100%.

by the usual observational bounds on the effective number of massless degrees

$n_{\nu_{\mathrm{nt}}}\lesssim 0.5\,n_\gamma$. In particular, $N_\mathrm{eff}$
can be larger than 3.046 in the absence of any exotic states. Non-thermal relic

quantum point contact (biased at a voltage $V_0$) leads to a fluctuating
current that in turn emits radiation in the microwave regime. By calculating
the Fano factor $F$ for the case where only a single channel contributes to the
transport, it has been shown that the radiation produced at finite frequency
$\omega_0$ close to $e V_0/\hbar$ and at low temperatures is nonclassical with
sub-Poissonian statistics ($F<1$). The origin of this effect is the fermionic
nature of the electrons producing the radiation, which reduces the probability
of simultaneous emission of two or more photons. However, the Fano factor,
being a time-averaged quantity, offers only limited information about the
system. Here, we calculate the second-order coherence $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ for this
source of radiation. We show that due to the interference of two contributions,
two photon processes (leading to bunching) are completely absent at zero
temperature for $T=50\,\%$. At low temperatures, we find a competition of the
contribution due to Gaussian current-current fluctuations (leading to bunching)
with the one due to non-Gaussian fluctuations (leading to antibunching). At
slightly elevated temperatures, the non-Gaussian contribution becomes
suppressed whereas the Gaussian contributions remain largely independent of
temperature. We show that the competition of the two contributions leads to a
nonmonotonic behavior of the second-order coherence as a function of time. As a
result, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ obtains a minimal value for times $\tau^* \simeq
\omega_0^{-1}$. Close to this time, the second-order coherence remains below 1
at temperatures where the Fano factor is already above 1. We identify realistic
experimental parameters that can be used to test the sub-Poissonian nature of
the radiation.

evolution of the universe. Galaxies grow their stellar mass by a combination of
star formation and mergers, with a relative importance that is redshift
dependent. Theoretical models predict quantitatively different contributions
from the two channels; measuring these from the data is a crucial constraint.
Exploiting the UltraVISTA catalog and a unique sample of progenitors of local
ultra massive galaxies selected with an abundance matching approach, we
quantify the role of the two mechanisms from z=2 to 0. We also compare our
results to two independent incarnations of semi-analytic models. At all
redshifts, progenitors are found in a variety of environments, ranging from
being isolated to having 5-10 companions with mass ratio at least 1:10 within a
projected radius of 500 kpc. In models, progenitors have a systematically
larger number of companions, entailing a larger mass growth for mergers than in
observations, at all redshifts. Generally, in both observations and models, the
inferred and the expected mass growth roughly agree, within the uncertainties.
Overall, our analysis confirms the model predictions, showing how the growth
history of massive galaxies is dominated by in situ star formation at z~2, both
star-formation and mergers at 1<z<2, and by mergers alone at z<1. Nonetheless,
detailed comparisons still point out to tensions between the expected mass
growth and our results, which might be due to either an incorrect
progenitors-descendants selection, uncertainties on star formation rate and
mass estimates, or the adopted assumptions on merger rates.

in knots and filaments detected in CLASH HST ACS and WFC3 observations.
UV-derived SFRs in these BCGs span two orders of magnitude, including two with
a SFR $\gtrsim$ 100 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. These measurements are supplemented
with [\ion{O}{2}], [\ion{O}{3}], and H$\beta$ fluxes measured from spectra

star formation powers the line emission nebulae in these BCGs, although in many
BCGs there is also evidence of a LINER-like contribution to the line emission.
Coupling these data with Chandra X-ray measurements, we infer that the star
formation occurs exclusively in low-entropy cluster cores and exhibits a
correlation with gas properties related to cooling. We also perform an in-depth
study of the starburst history of the BCG in the cluster RXJ1532.9+3021, and
create 2D maps of stellar properties on scales down to $\sim$350 pc. These maps

generally on $\sim$ 0.5-1.0 Gyr timescales, although some filaments are
consistent with much younger ($\lesssim$ 100 Myr) burst timescales and may be
correlated with recent activity from the AGN. The relationship between BCG SFRs

feedback-regulated cooling in galaxy clusters and is consistent with recent

approximation in the mixed-vortex state of the underdoped cuprates even though
the Landau level index $n$ may be fairly low, $n\sim 10$. The models we
consider are fairly general, consisting of a variety of density wave states
combined with $d$-wave superconductivity within a mean field theory. Vortices
are introduced as quenched disorder and averaged over many realizations, which
can be considered as snapshots of a vortex liquid state. We also show that the
oscillations ride on top of a field independent density of states, $\rho(B)$,
for higher fields. This feature appears to be consistent with recent specific
heat measurements [C. Marcenat, et al. Nature Comm. {\bf 6}, 7927 (2015)]. At
lower fields we model the system as an ordered vortex lattice, and show that
its density of states follows a dependence $\rho(B)\propto \sqrt{B}$ in
agreement with the semiclassical results [G. E. Volovik, JETP Lett. {\bf 58},

across buildings, software-based solutions are tightly coupled to the sensor

  Metadata normalization is critical for scaling the deployment process and
allows us to decouple building-specific conventions from the code written for
building applications. It also allows us to deal with missing metadata. One
important aspect of normalization is to differentiate sensors by the typeof
phenomena being observed. In this paper, we propose a general, simple, yet
effective classification scheme to differentiate sensors in buildings by type.
We perform ensemble learning on data collected from over 2000 sensor streams in
two buildings. Our approach is able to achieve more than 92% accuracy for
classification within buildings and more than 82% accuracy for across
buildings. We also introduce a method for identifying potential misclassified
streams. This is important because it allows us to identify opportunities to
attain more input from experts -- input that could help improve classification
accuracy when ground truth is unavailable. We show that by adjusting a

which is being carried out in different centers in the World. For this purpose
we supply a short account of the development in the area which evolved over the
last 9 decades, since the discovery of the neutron. The evolution of the
physics of the atomic nucleus went through many stages as more data become
available. We briefly discuss models introduced to discern the physics behind
the experimental discoveries, such as the shell model, the collective model,
the statistical model, the interacting boson model, etc., some of these models
may be seemingly in conflict with each other, but this was shown to be only
apparent.
  The richness of the ideas and abundance of theoretical models attests to the
important fact that the nucleus is a really singular system in the sense that
it evolves from two-body bound states such as the deuteron, to few-body bound
states, such as $^4$He, $^7$Li, $^9$Be etc. and up the ladder to heavier bound
nuclei containing up to more than 200 nucleons. Clearly statistical mechanics
does not work for such finite system, neither does other theories applicable to
condensed matter systems. The richness of nuclear physics stems from these
restrictions. New theories and models are presently being developed. Theories
of the structure and reactions of neutron-rich and proton-rich nuclei, called
exotic nuclei, halo nuclei, or Borromean nuclei deal with the wealth of
experimental data available in the last 35 years. Further, nuclear astrophysics
and stellar and Big Bang nucleosynthesis have become a more mature subject. Due
to limited space, this review only covers a few selected topics, mainly those
with which the authors have worked with.

their physical infrastructure, and hence they are vulnerable to man-made

(WMD) attacks, as well as to natural disasters. Large-scale disasters may cause
huge data loss and connectivity disruption in these networks. As our dependence
on network services increases, the need for novel survivability methods to
mitigate the effects of disasters on communication networks becomes a major
concern. Software-Defined Networking (SDN), by centralizing control logic and
separating it from physical equipment, facilitates network programmability and
opens up new ways to design disaster-resilient networks. On the other hand, to
fully exploit the potential of SDN, along with data-plane survivability, we
also need to design the control plane to be resilient enough to survive network
failures caused by disasters. Several distributed SDN controller architectures
have been proposed to mitigate the risks of overload and failure, but they are
optimized for limited faults without addressing the extent of large-scale
disaster failures. For disaster resiliency of the control plane, we propose to
design it as a virtual network, which can be solved using Virtual Network
Mapping techniques. We select appropriate mapping of the controllers over the
physical network such that the connectivity among the controllers
(controller-to-controller) and between the switches to the controllers
(switch-to-controllers) is not compromised by physical infrastructure failures
caused by disasters. We formally model this disaster-aware control-plane design

sufficient for gravitational-wave detection, to extract information on the

difference between the two types is consistent with zero at just $-1.9 \pm 1.7
\%$. This indicates that there are no significant biases in either estimation
method and provides an important validation of the stellar-evolution theory
that underlies photometric distance estimates. The analysis also estimates
dynamical M/L ratios for our clusters; on average, the dynamically-inferred M/L
ratios agree with existing stellar-population-based M/L ratios that assume a
Chabrier initial mass function (IMF) to within $-8.8 \pm 6.4 \%$, implying that
such an IMF is consistent with our data. Our results are also consistent with a

actual function value and its estimate at an arbitrary node, given the
observations in an arbitrary subset of nodes containing that node. The main
contributions include: 1) A lower bound on the conditional mutual information
via so-called small ball probabilities, which captures the dependence of the
computation time on the joint distribution of the observations at the nodes,
the structure of the function, and the accuracy requirement. For linear
functions, the small ball probability can be expressed by L\'evy concentration
functions of sums of independent random variables, for which tight estimates
are available that lead to strict improvements over existing lower bounds on
computation time. 2) An upper bound on the conditional mutual information via
strong data processing inequalities, which complements and strengthens existing
cutset-capacity upper bounds. 3) A multi-cutset analysis that quantifies the
loss (dissipation) of the information needed for computation as it flows across
a succession of cutsets in the network. This analysis is based on reducing a
general network to a line network with bidirectional links and self-links, and
the results highlight the dependence of the computation time on the diameter of
the network, a fundamental parameter that is missing from most of the existing
lower bounds on computation time.

zero energy band gaps. Applying tensile biaxial strain leads to a reduction of
the buckling height. Atomically flat structures with zero bucking height have
been observed when the AA-stacking structures are under a critical biaxial

materials, especially in thin film forms, has been a challenging task due to
the fact that the VO2 polymorphs are closely related to each other in a
thermodynamic framework. Here, we report epitaxial stabilization of the VO2
polymorphs to synthesize high quality single crystalline thin films and study
the phase stability of those metastable materials. We selectively deposit all
the phases on various perovskite substrates with different crystallographic
orientations. By investigating the phase instability, phonon modes and
transport behaviours, not only do we find distinctively contrasting physical
properties of the VO2 polymorphs, but that the polymorphs could be on the verge
of phase transitions when heated as low as ~400 oC. Our successful epitaxy of
both VO2(A) and VO2(B) phases, which are rarely studied due to the lack of
phase pure materials, will open the door to the fundamental studies of VO2
polymorphs for potential applications in advanced electronic and energy
devices.

transform (STFT), which is a simple and flexible time-frequency decomposition
that estimates the short-time spectrum of a signal. However, the duration of
short STFT frames are inherently limited by the nonstationarity of speech
signals. The main contribution of this paper is a demonstration of speech
enhancement and automatic speech recognition in the presence of reverberation
and noise by extending the length of analysis windows. We accomplish this
extension by performing enhancement in the short-time fan-chirp transform
(STFChT) domain, an overcomplete time-frequency representation that is coherent
with speech signals over longer analysis window durations than the STFT. This
extended coherence is gained by using a linear model of fundamental frequency
variation of voiced speech signals. Our approach centers around using a
single-channel minimum mean-square error log-spectral amplitude (MMSE-LSA)
estimator proposed by Habets, which scales coefficients in a time-frequency
domain to suppress noise and reverberation. In the case of multiple
microphones, we preprocess the data with either a minimum variance
distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, or a delay-and-sum beamformer (DSB).
We evaluate our algorithm on both speech enhancement and recognition tasks for
the REVERB challenge dataset. Compared to the same processing done in the STFT
domain, our approach achieves significant improvement in terms of objective
enhancement metrics (including PESQ---the ITU-T standard measurement for speech
quality). In terms of automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance as
measured by word error rate (WER), our experiments indicate that the STFT with
a long window is more effective for ASR.

the sensor region under the pixel circuitry placed outside the buried p-wells

pixel-circuitry outside the BPW creates local minimums in the electric
potentials at the interface between the sensor and buried oxide layers. Thus, a
part of signal charge is trapped there and is not collected to the BPW. Based
on this result, we modified the placement of the in-pixel circuitry so that the
electric fields would converge toward the BPW. We confirmed that the CCE at

system, where the base-station (BS) is equipped with a large number of
antennas. We consider the setup where the single-antenna mobile users operate
in half- duplex, while each antenna at the BS is capable of full-duplex
transmissions, i.e., it can transmit and receive simultaneously using the same
frequency spectrum. The fundamental challenge in this system is intra-cell
inter-node interference, generated by the transmissions of uplink users to the
receptions at the downlink users. The key operational challenge is estimating
and aggregating inter-mobile channel estimates, which can potentially overwhelm
any gains from full-duplex operation.
  In this work, we propose a scalable and distributed scheme to optimally
manage the inter-node interference by utilizing a ""one- hop information
architecture"". In this architecture, the BS only needs to know the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) from the downlink users. Each
uplink user needs its own SINR, along with a weighted signal-plus-noise metric
from its one-hop neighboring downlink users, which are the downlink users that
it interferes with. The proposed one-hop information architecture does not
require any network devices to comprehensively gather the vast inter-node
interference channel knowledge, and hence significantly reduces the overhead.
Based on the one-hop information architecture, we design a distributed power
control algorithm and implement such architecture using overheard feedback
information. We show that, in typical asymptotic regimes with many users and
antennas, the proposed distributed power control scheme improves the overall
network utility and reduces the transmission power of the uplink users.

unstable. A mode mismatch also makes it difficult to find an attractor set to
which the state trajectory converges. A switching condition for stability is
characterized by the total time when the modes of the plant and the controller

trajectories by using a common Lyapunov function computed from a randomized
algorithm. The switching condition can be reduced to a dwell-time condition.

Although the periodic signals may not represent any stable orbital modulations,

superorbital periods and structure of the accretion discs. In particular, we
show that the outburst recurrence time of ESO 243-49 HLX-1 varies over time and

kinds of precession, and the true binary period is expected to be much shorter.

installed in the focal plane camera. With the 23 m mirror dish, the night sky
background (NSB) rate amounts to several hundreds MHz per pixel. In order to
record clean images of gamma-ray showers with minimal NSB contamination, a fast
sampling of the signal waveform is required so that the signal integration time
can be as short as the Cherenkov light flash duration (a few ns). We have
developed a readout board which samples waveforms of seven PMTs per board at a
GHz rate. Since a GHz FADC has a high power consumption, leading to large heat
dissipation, we adopted the analog memory ASIC ""DRS4"". The sampler has 1024
capacitors per channel and can sample the waveform at a GHz rate. Four channels
of a chip are cascaded to obtain deeper sampling depth with 4096 capacitors.
After a trigger is generated in a mezzanine on the board, the waveform stored
in the capacitor array is subsequently digitized with a low speed (33 MHz) ADC
and transferred via the FPGA-based Gigabit Ethernet to a data acquisition
system. Both a low power consumption (2.64 W per channel) and high speed
sampling with a bandwidth of $>$300 MHz have been achieved. In addition, in
order to increase the dynamic range of the readout we adopted a two gain system
achieving from 0.2 up to 2000 photoelectrons in total. We finalized the board
design for the first LST and proceeded to mass production. Performance of
produced boards are being checked with a series of quality control (QC) tests.

opposition are said to be monotonically associated. For certain phenomena, this
tendency is causally restricted to a subpopulation, as, for example, an
allergic reaction to an irritant. Previously, Yu et al. (2011) devised a method
of rearranging observations to test paired data to see if such an association
might be present in a subpopulation. However, the computational intensity of
the method limited its application to relatively small samples of data, and the
test itself only judges if association is present in some subpopulation; it
does not clearly identify the subsample that came from this subpopulation,
especially when the whole sample tests positive. The present paper adds a
""top-K"" feature (Sampath and Verducci (2013)) based on a multistage ranking
model, that identifies a concise subsample that is likely to contain a high
proportion of observations from the subpopulation in which the association is
supported. Computational improvements incorporated into this top-K tau-path

vertex may belong to multiple communities, as is often the case in social
networks. The multiple memberships of vertices and thus the strong overlaps
among communities render many detection algorithms invalid. We develop a
Partial Community Merger Algorithm (PCMA) for detecting communities with
significant overlaps as well as slightly overlapping and disjoint ones. It is a
bottom-up approach based on properly reassembling partial information of
communities revealed in ego networks of vertices to reconstruct complete
communities. Noise control and merger order are the two key issues in
implementing this idea. We propose a novel similarity measure between two
merged communities that can suppress noise and an efficient algorithm that
recursively merges the most similar pair of communities. The validity and
accuracy of PCMA is tested against two benchmarks and compared to four existing
algorithms. It is the most efficient one with linear complexity and it
outperforms the compared algorithms when vertices have multiple memberships.
PCMA is applied to two huge online social networks, Friendster and Sina Weibo.
Millions of communities are detected and they are of higher qualities than the
corresponding metadata groups. We find that the latter should not be regarded
as the ground-truth of structural communities. The significant overlapping
pattern found in the detected communities confirms the need of new algorithms,
such as PCMA, to handle multiple memberships of vertices in social networks.

  2015",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As the capacity demand of mobile applications keeps increasing, the backhaul
network is becoming a bottleneck to support high quality of experience (QoE) in
next-generation wireless networks. Content caching at base stations (BSs) is a
promising approach to alleviate the backhaul burden and reduce user-perceived
latency. In this paper, we consider a wireless caching network where all the
BSs are connected to a central controller via backhaul links. In such a
network, users can obtain the required data from candidate BSs if the data are
pre-cached. Otherwise, the user data need to be first retrieved from the
central controller to local BSs, which introduces extra delay over the
backhaul. In order to reduce the download delay, the caching placement strategy
needs to be optimized. We formulate such a design problem as the minimization
of the average download delay over user requests, subject to the caching
capacity constraint of each BS. Different from existing works, our model takes
BS cooperation in the radio access into consideration and is fully aware of the
propagation delay on the backhaul links. The design problem is a mixed integer
programming problem and is highly complicated, and thus we relax the problem
and propose a low-complexity algorithm. Simulation results will show that the
proposed algorithm can effectively determine the near-optimal caching placement
and provide significant performance gains over conventional caching placement
strategies.

Gemini Flamingo-2 camera are modeled by a Monte Carlo dust model, which yields
a low dust ejection speed ($1/10$ of that of moderately active comets),
dominance of large dust grains, and a low dust production of $0.4~\mathrm{kg

reddish nucleus of 209P/LINEAR that is similar to D-type asteroids and most
Trojan asteroids. Meteor observations with the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar
(CMOR), coupled with meteoroid stream modeling, suggest a low dust production
of the parent over the past few hundred orbits, although there are hints of a
some temporary increase in activity in the 18th century. Dynamical simulations
indicate 209P/LINEAR may have resided in a stable near-Earth orbit for $\sim
10^4$~yr, which is significantly longer than typical JFCs. All these lines of
evidence imply that 209P/LINEAR as an aging comet quietly exhausting its
remaining near surface volatiles. We also compare 209P/LINEAR to other low

eager to determine the best ad to display. Consequently, many algorithms have
been developed that calculate the optimal ad to show to the current user at the

optimizing among different properties such as background color, image size, or
set of images. However, there is a more fundamental layer. Our study looks at
new qualities of ads that can be determined before an ad is shown (rather than
online optimization) and defines which ads are most likely to be successful.

investigations. The origin of the discrepancy is traced back to the anomalous
scaling of the dissipation rate fluctuations. Phenomenological arguments are
presented which explain the observed results. The study shows that previously
proposed models underpredict the variance of frictional temperature
fluctuations by a factor proportional to the square of the Taylor-scale

the physical origin of the tori and the differences in the tori among AGNs are
not clear. In a previous paper based on three-dimensional
radiation-hydorodynamic calculations, we proposed a physics-based mechanism for
the obscuration, called ""radiation-driven fountains,"" in which the circulation
of the gas driven by central radiation naturally forms a thick disk that
partially obscures the nuclear emission. Here, we expand this mechanism and
conduct a series of simulations to explore how obscuration depends on the
properties of AGNs. We found that the obscuring fraction f_obs for a given
column density toward the AGNs changes depending on both the AGN luminosity and
the black hole mass. In particular, f_obs for N_H \geq 10^22 cm^-2 increases
from ~0.2 to ~0.6 as a function of the X-ray luminosity L_X in the 10^{42-44}
ergs/s range, but f_obs becomes small (~0.4) above a luminosity (~10^{45}
ergs/s). The behaviors of f_obs can be understood by a simple analytic model
and provide insight into the redshift evolution of the obscuration. The
simulations also show that for a given L_AGN, f_obs is always smaller
(~0.2-0.3) for a larger column density (N_H \geq 10^23 cm^-2). We also found
cases that more than 70% of the solid angles can be covered by the fountain

system is converted to a typical form of the Jaynes-Cummings model for two
three-level atoms. The exact analytical solutions of the wave function for
different considered atom-field systems are exactly obtained with the help of
the Laplace transform technique, when the atoms are initially prepared in the
topmost excited state and the quantized field is in a coherent state. In order
to examine the nonclassicality features of the deduced states, the dynamics of
the entanglement between subsystems is discussed via two well-known measures,
namely, von Neumann entropy of the reduced state and negativity. In addition,
we pay attention to the temporal behaviour of quantum statistics of the photons
of the field and squeezing phenomenon. Meanwhile, the influence of the external
classical field on the latter physical quantities is analyzed in detail. The
results show that the mentioned quantities can be sensitively controlled via
the external classical field. Also, numerical computations imply the fact that
the nonclassicality features in $\Xi$-type three-level atomic system is more
visible than the other two configurations. In addition, it is shown that in the
particular case of $\Lambda$-type atomic system, the rank of the reduced
density matrix of the three-level atoms is no larger than three, so that
negativity fully captures the entanglement of this system and that such
entanglement is distillable.

see the naturality of using regular homotopy combined with virtual crossings
(permutation operators), as they occur significantly in the category associated
with a Hopf algebra. We show how this approach via categories and quantum

nonlinear formalism, it is assumed that the single-mode field, atom-field
coupling and Kerr medium are all $f$-deformed. By using the adiabatic
elimination method, it is shown that, the Hamiltonian of the considered system
can be reduced to an effective Hamiltonian with two two-level atoms and
$f$-deformed Stark shift. In spite of the fact that, the system seems to be
complicated, under initial conditions which may be prepared for the atoms
(coherent superposition of their ground and upper states) and the field
(coherent state), the explicit form of the state vector of the entire system is
analytically obtained. Then, the entanglement dynamics between different
subsystems (i.e. ""field-two atoms"", ""atom-(field+atom)"" and ""atom-atom"") are
evaluated through appropriate measures like von Neumann entropy, tangle and
concurrence. In addition, the effects of intensity-dependent coupling, deformed
Kerr medium, detuning parameter, deformed Stark shift and multi-photon process
on the considered entanglement measures are numerically analyzed, in detail. It
is shown that the degree of entanglement between subsystems can be controlled
by selecting the evolved parameters, suitably. Briefly, the Kerr medium highly
decreases the amount of different considered measures of entanglement,
especially for two-photon transition. This destructive effect preserves even
when all other parameters are present, too. Furthermore, we find that the

the use of single spins in diamond in conjunction with atomic force microscopy
techniques has allowed significant progress towards this goal, but
generalisation of this approach has so far been impeded by long acquisition
times or by the absence of simultaneous topographic information. Here we report
on a scanning quantum probe microscope which solves both issues, by employing a
nano-spin ensemble hosted in a nanodiamond. This approach provides up to an
order of magnitude gain in acquisition time, whilst preserving sub-100 nm

spin relaxometry, under ambient conditions. Our images reveal fast magnetic
field fluctuations in addition to a static component, indicating the presence
of both superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic particles. We next demonstrate a
new imaging modality where the nano-spin ensemble is used as a thermometer. We
use this technique to map the photo-induced heating generated by laser

through two soluble models of the pinning potential. Comprised by a Magnus
term, a dissipative term and a pinning force, Thiele's equation resembles
Newton's law but in virtue of the topological character of the first two, it
differs significantly from Newtonian mechanics and because the Magnus force is
dominant, unlike its mechanical counterpart, the Coriolis force, skyrmion
trajectories do not necessarily have mechanical counterparts. This is important
if we are to understand skykrmion dynamics and tap into its potential for
data-storage technology. We identify a pinning threshold velocity for the
one-dimensional potential and for a two-dimensional potential we find a pinning
point and the skyrmion trajectories toward the point are spirals whose
frequency (compare Kepler's second law) and amplitude decay depends only on the
Gilbert constant and potential at the pinning point.

temporally evolving turbulent free shear layers in an inviscid incompressible
fluid has recently been established by extensive numerical simulations
(Suryanarayanan et al, Phys. Rev. E 89, 013009, 2014). Here, the effects of the
velocity ratio across a spatially evolving 2D free shear layer are investigated
by vortex-gas simulations, using a computational model based on Basu et al
(1992, 1995), but with a crucial improvement that ensures conservation of
global circulation. These are carried out for a range of values of the velocity
ratio parameter $\lambda= (U_1-U_2)/(U_1+U_2)$, where $U_1$ and $U_2$ ($< U_1$)
are respective velocities across the layer. The simulations show that the
conditions imposed at the beginning of the free shear layer and at the exit to
the domain can affect the flow evolution in their respective neighborhoods, the
latter being particularly strong as $\lambda \rightarrow 1$. In between the two
neighborhoods is a regime of universal self-preserving growth rate given by a
universal function of $\lambda$ The computed growth rates are located within
the scatter of experimental data on plane mixing layers, and in close agreement
with recent high Reynolds number experiments and 3D LES studies, past the
mixing transition, and support the view that free shear layer growth can be
largely explained by the 2D vortex dynamics of the quasi-two-dimensional large
scale structures.

cylinder and a concentric elastic tube. The gap is initially filled with a thin
fluid layer. The study focuses on viscous-elastic time-scales for which the
rate of solid deformation is of the same order-of-magnitude as the velocity of
the fluid. We employ an elastic shell model and the lubrication approximation
to obtain a forced nonlinear diffusion equation governing the viscous-elastic
interaction. In the case of an advancing liquid front into a configuration with
a negligible film layer (compared with the radial deformation of the elastic
tube), the governing equation degenerates into a forced porous medium equation,
for which several closed-form solutions are presented. In the case where the
initial film layer is non-negligible, self-similarity is used to devise
propagation laws for a pressure driven liquid front. When advancing external
forces are applied on the tube, the formation of dipole structures is shown to
dominate the initial stages of the induced flow and deformation regimes. These
are variants of the dipole solution of the porous medium equation. Finally,
since the rate of pressure propagation decreases with the height of the liquid
film, we show that isolated moving deformation patterns can be created and
superimposed to generate a moving wave-like deformation field. The presented
interaction between viscosity and elasticity may be applied to fields such as
soft-robotics and micro-scale or larger swimmers by allowing for the
time-dependent control of an axisymmetric compliant boundary.

features in the solar activity, heliospheric characteristics and the galactic
cosmic ray (GCR) intensity. Recently the maximum phase of the current solar
cycle (SC) 24, in many relations anomalous when compared with solar cycles of
the second half of the 20-th century, came to the end. The corresponding phase
in the GCR intensity cycle is also in progress. In this paper we study
different aspects of the sunspot, heliospheric and GCR behavior around this
phase. Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) The maximum phase of the sunspot
SC 24 ended in 06.2014, the development of the sunspot cycle being similar to
those of SC 14, 15 (the Glaisberg minimum). The maximum phase of SC 24 in the
GCR intensity is still in progress. 2) The inversion of the heliospheric
magnetic field consists of three stages, characterized by the appearance of the
global heliospheric current sheet (HCS), connecting all longitudes. In two
transition dipole stages beside the global HCS there are additional local HCSs,
while the inversion stage lies between two transition dipole ones and there is
no global HCS in this stage. The inversion stage of the current SC 24 is the
longest when compared with those for SC 21-23. The second transition dipole
stage and hence the whole inversion period of the heliospheric magnetic field
in SC 24 provisionally ended in 08.2014. 3) The behavior of the GCR intensity
in the period of the sunspot maximum phase and the inversion of the
heliospheric magnetic fields for SC 21-23 demonstrates all the characteristic
features for this period: the two-gap structure corresponding to two-peak
structure in the sunspot activity, and the energy hysteresis. In the current SC
24 the GCR intensity shows rather unusual features and we should wait for one
or even two years to see the whole picture.

long-term variations (11-year and 22-year) in the galactic cosmic rays (GCR)
characteristics is still insufficient and to improve it we need new approaches
and methods. For the time being there is a long-lasting controversy on how
these long-term variations, observed for more than 50 years in the inner
heliosphere, are formed. It is widely believed that the 11-year variation is
due entirely to the toroidal branch of solar activity (the area and number of
sunspots, the strength of the heliospheric magnetic field etc) because of the
diffusion, convection and adiabatic energy loss, while the much smaller 22-year
variation is caused by the particle drifts connected with the poloidal branch
of solar activity (the high-latitude solar magnetic fields). At the same time,
both past and more recent numerical simulations indicate that the contribution
of particle drifts could be significant for both 22- and 11-year variations in
the GCR intensities. However, even those who agree on the significant influence
of drifts appear to have different perceptions on the mechanisms of this
influence. In this paper, we present an analysis of the possible causes of the
first point of view (small role of drifts in the 11-year GCR variation) and the
reasons why one can expect the significant contri- bution of the processes
connected with the poloidal branch of solar activity in both types of the
long-term variations of the GCR characteristics. Then we briefly discuss some
numerical methods suggested in the past and recently and the approaches and
perspectives for the sought-for methods are considered.

superconductors, the dominant factors and the exact working mechanism that is
responsible for the high Tc need to be clarified. In particular, a clean
control of carrier concentration remains to be a challenge for revealing how
superconductivity and Fermi surface topology evolves with carrier concentration
in bulk FeSe. Here, we report the evolution of superconductivity in the FeSe
thin flake with systematically regulated carrier concentrations by
liquid-gating technique. High-temperature superconductivity at 48 K can be
achieved only with electron doping tuned by gate voltage in FeSe thin flake
with Tc less than 10 K. This is the first time to achieve such a high
temperature superconductivity in FeSe without either epitaxial interface or
external pressure. It definitely proves that the simple electron-doping process
is able to induce high-temperature superconductivity with Tc as high as 48 K in
bulk FeSe. Intriguingly, our data also indicates that the superconductivity is
suddenly changed from low-Tc phase to high-Tc phase with a Lifshitz transition
at certain carrier concentration. These results help us to build a unified

with characteristic time 0.5-4 years in different solar, heliospheric and
cosmic ray characteristics. In this paper a hypothesis is checked on the causes
of the apparent lack of correlation between solar and heliospheric QBOs, then
the possible mechanisms of QBO in the GCR intensity are discussed as well as
the idea of the same nature of the step-like changes and Gnevyshev Gap effects
in the GCR intensity.
  Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) In the first approximation the
hypothesis is justified that the change in the sunspot and QBO cycles in the
transition from the Sun to the heliosphere is due to 1) the different magnitude
and time behavior of the large-scale and small-scale photospheric solar
magnetic fields and 2) the stronger attenuation of the small-scale fields in
this transition. 2) As the QBO in the HMF strength influences both the
diffusion coefficients and drift velocity, it can give rise to the complex QBO
in the GCR intensity with respect to the dominating HMF polarity. The
description of drift velocity field for the periods of the HMF inversion is
suggested, although it has drawbacks. 3) As the conditions in the heliosphere
are quite different around the sunspot maximum and during the periods of low
solar activity (both with respect to the HMF polarity distribution and with the
presence or absence of the large-scale barriers), the suggestion that both the
step-like changes of the GCR intensity and Gnevyshev Gap effect could have the
same nature, looks questionable.

robust, simple, and efficient on a wide spectral range. The idea, based on the
article by Sparks et al. (2012), is to use polarization scramblers to create a
spatial modulation of the polarization. Along the height of the wedges of the
scramblers, the thickness of the birefringent material crossed by the light,
and thus the retardance, vary continuously. This variation creates an intensity
modulation of the light related to the entrance polarization state. Analyzing
this modulation with a linear polarizer, and dispersing the light spectrally in
the orthogonal spatial direction, enables the measurement of the full Stokes
vector over the entire spectrum. This determination is performed with a
single-shot measurement and without any moving parts in the system. After a
quick introduction to the concept and optical design, this article presents the
tolerancing study of the optical bench using this spectropolarimeter. The
impact of different error sources, such as, birefringence uncertainty or

observed far-infrared (FIR) maps. Additionally, given the corresponding CO map,
the method simultaneously estimates the slope and intercept between the FIR and
CO intensities, which are global properties of the observed source. The model
accounts for correlated and uncorrelated uncertainties, such as those present
in Herschel observations. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the accuracy
of the HB method, and contrast the results with common non-hierarchical fitting
methods. As an initial application, we model the dust and gas on 100 pc scales
in the Magellanic Clouds from Herschel FIR and NANTEN CO observations. The
slopes of the $\log S_{\rm IR}-\log I_{\rm CO}$ relationship are similar in
both galaxies, falling in the range 1.1$-$1.7. However, in the SMC the
intercept is nearly 3 times higher, which can be explained by its lower
metallicity than the LMC, resulting in a larger $S_{\rm IR}$ per unit $I_{\rm
CO}$. The HB modelling evidences an increase in $T_{\rm eff}$ in regions with
the highest $I_{\rm CO}$ in the LMC. This may be due to enhanced dust heating
in the densest molecular regions from young stars. Such simultaneous dust and
gas modelling may reveal variations in the properties of the ISM and its

interference cancellation (IMF-SIC) algorithm for symbol vector detection in
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing systems. The
multiple feedback (MF) strategy in successive interference cancellation (SIC)
is based on the concept of shadow area constraint (SAC) where, if the decision
falls in the shadow region multiple neighboring constellation points will be
used in the decision feedback loop followed by the conventional SIC. The best
candidate symbol from multiple neighboring symbols is selected using the
maximum likelihood (ML) criteria. However, while deciding the best symbol from
multiple neighboring symbols, the SAC condition may occur in subsequent layers
which results in inaccurate decision. In order to overcome this limitation, in
the proposed algorithm, SAC criteria is checked recursively for each layer.
This results in successful mitigation of error propagation thus significantly
improving the bit error rate (BER) performance. Further, we also propose an
ordered IMF-SIC (OIMF-SIC) where we use log likelihood ratio (LLR) based
dynamic ordering of the detection sequence. In OIMF-SIC, we use the term
dynamic ordering in the sense that the detection order is updated after every
successful decision. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms
outperform the existing detectors such as conventional SIC and MF-SIC in terms
of BER, and achieves a near ML performance.

of first-person (egocentric) daily activity recognition. However, due to noisy
camera motion and frequent changes in viewpoint and scale, most of the previous
egocentric action recognition methods fail to capture and model highly
discriminative object features. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline for
first-person daily activity recognition, aiming at more discriminative object
feature representation and object-motion feature fusion. Our object feature
extraction and representation pipeline is inspired by the recent success of
object hypotheses and deep convolutional neural network based detection
frameworks. Our key contribution is a simple yet effective manipulated object
proposal generation scheme. This scheme leverages motion cues such as motion
boundary and motion magnitude (in contrast, camera motion is usually considered
as ""noise"" for most previous methods) to generate a more compact and
discriminative set of object proposals, which are more closely related to the
objects which are being manipulated. Then, we learn more discriminative object
detectors from these manipulated object proposals based on region-based
convolutional neural network (R-CNN). Meanwhile, we develop a network based
feature fusion scheme which better combines object and motion features. We show
in experiments that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the

distribution is proposed and tested. The filter relies on the conditional
Gaussian distribution of the state given the model-error and
predictability-error covariance matrices. The latter are treated as random
matrices and updated in a hierarchical Bayes scheme along with the state. The
(hyper)prior distribution of the covariance matrices is assumed to be inverse
Wishart. The new Hierarchical Bayes Ensemble Filter (HBEF) assimilates ensemble
members as generalized observations and allows ordinary observations to
influence the covariances. The actual probability distribution of the ensemble
members is allowed to be different from the true one. An approximation that
leads to a practicable analysis algorithm is proposed. The new filter is
studied in numerical experiments with a doubly stochastic one-variable model of
""truth"". The model permits the assessment of the variance of the truth and the
true filtering error variance at each time instance. The HBEF is shown to
outperform the EnKF and the HEnKF by Myrseth and Omre (2010) in a wide range of
filtering regimes in terms of performance of its primary and secondary filter.

carried out using high-resolution (R = 81 000) and high signal-to-noise ratio
(800 < S/N/pixel < 3400) spectrum, in the wavelength range 3700 - 10475,
obtained with a seven-hour exposure time, using the ESPaDOnS at the CFHT. The
calculations in LTE were performed with the OSMARCS 1D atmospheric model and
the spectrum synthesis code Turbospectrum, while the analysis in NLTE is based
on the MULTI code. We present LTE abundances for 26 elements, and NLTE
calculations for the species C I, O I, Na I, Mg I, Al I, K I, Ca I, Sr II, and
Ba II lines. The abundance analysis provided an extensive line list suitable
for metal-poor subgiant stars. The results for Li, CNO, alpha-, and iron peak

along with a NLTE Eu correction and a 3D Ba correction from literature, leads
to [Eu/Ba] = +0.59 +/- 0.18. This result confirms a dominant r-process

phase transition line is found from the effective potential at finite T and mu
taking into account the plasma screening effects. We find the location of the
critical end point (CEP) to be (mu^CEP/T_c,T^CEP/T_c) \sim (1.2,0.8), where T_c
is the (pseudo)critical temperature for the crossover phase transition at
vanishing mu. This location lies within the region found by lattice inspired

argue that the location is due to the proper treatment of the plasma screening

inter alia, the effect of N2 doping on the EL mechanism in rare-event

mass, and searched for invisible Higgs boson decays, using multiple production
and decay channels with up to 4.7 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data at
$\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. In the current study,
the measured production and decay rates of the observed Higgs boson in the
$\gamma\gamma$, $ZZ$, $WW$, $Z\gamma$, $bb$, $\tau\tau$, and $\mu\mu$ decay
channels, along with results from the associated production of a Higgs boson
with a top-quark pair, are used to probe the scaling of the couplings with
mass. Limits are set on parameters in extensions of the Standard Model
including a composite Higgs boson, an additional electroweak singlet, and
two-Higgs-doublet models. Together with the measured mass of the scalar Higgs
boson in the $\gamma\gamma$ and $ZZ$ decay modes, a lower limit is set on the
pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass of $m_{A}>370$ GeV in the ""hMSSM"" simplified
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Results from direct searches for heavy
Higgs bosons are also interpreted in the hMSSM. Direct searches for invisible
Higgs boson decays in the vector-boson fusion and associated production of a
Higgs boson with $W/Z$ ($Z\to ll$, $W/Z \to jj$) modes are statistically
combined to set an upper limit on the Higgs boson invisible branching ratio of
0.25. The use of the measured visible decay rates in a more general coupling
fit improves the upper limit to 0.23, constraining a Higgs portal model of dark
matter.

astrometry in terms of a comparison with the Cramer-Rao lower variance bound.
In this inference context the performance of the least-squares estimator does
not offer a closed-form expression, but a new result is presented (Theorem 1)
where both the bias and the mean-square-error of the least-squares estimator
are bounded and approximated analytically, in the latter case in terms of a
nominal value and an interval around it. From the predicted nominal value we
analyze how efficient is the least-squares estimator in comparison with the
minimum variance Cramer-Rao bound. Based on our results, we show that, for the
high signal-to-noise ratio regime, the performance of the least-squares
estimator is significantly poorer than the Cramer-Rao bound, and we
characterize this gap analytically. On the positive side, we show that for the
challenging low signal-to-noise regime (attributed to either a weak
astronomical signal or a noise-dominated condition) the least-squares estimator
is near optimal, as its performance asymptotically approaches the Cramer-Rao
bound. However, we also demonstrate that, in general, there is no unbiased
estimator for the astrometric position that can precisely reach the Cramer-Rao
bound. We validate our theoretical analysis through simulated digital-detector
observations under typical observing conditions. We show that the nominal value
for the mean-square-error of the least-squares estimator (obtained from our
theorem) can be used as a benchmark indicator of the expected statistical
performance of the least-squares method under a wide range of conditions. Our
results are valid for an idealized linear (one-dimensional) array detector
where intra-pixel response changes are neglected, and where flat-fielding is
achieved with very high accuracy.

topology of the contact network. The shear-jamming transition is marked by the
appearance of this broken symmetry. We extend our earlier work, by comparing
and contrasting real space measures of rheology with those obtained from the

system evolves through the rigidity transition in two different shear

to protocol and packing fraction, and demonstrate that it is possible to define
a protocol-independent order parameter in this dual space, which signals the
onset of rigidity.

plasma membrane and material from the outside. In cells with turgor, pressure
opposes membrane defor- mations, and increases the amount of force that has to
be generated by the endocytic machinery. To determine this force, and calculate
the shape of the membrane, we used physical theory to model an elastic surface
under pressure. Accurate fits of experimental profiles are obtained assuming
that the coated membrane is highly rigid and preferentially curved at the
endocytic site. The forces required from the actin machinery peaks at the onset
of deformation, indicating that once invagination has been initiated,
endocytosis is unlikely to stall before completion. Coat proteins do not lower
the initiation force but may affect the process by the curvature they induce.
In the presence of isotropic curvature inducers, pulling the tip of the
invagination can trigger the formation of a neck at the base of the
invagination. Hence direct neck constriction by actin may not be required,
while its pulling role is essential. Finally, the theory shows that anisotropic
curvature effectors stabilize membrane invaginations, and the loss of
crescent-shaped BAR domain proteins such as Rvs167 could therefore trigger
membrane scission.

light signal of 51\,Peg\,b could be caused by a ring system around the planet.
We use a simple model to compare the observed signal with the expected signal
from a short-period giant planet with rings. We also use simple dynamical
arguments to understand the possible geometry of such a system. We provide
evidence that, to a good approximation, the observations are compatible with
the signal expected from a ringed planet, assuming that the rings are
non-coplanar with the orbital plane. However, based on dynamical arguments, we
also show that this configuration is unlikely. In the case of coplanar rings we
then demonstrate that the incident flux on the ring surface is about 2\% the
value received by the planet, a value that renders the ring explanation
unlikely. The results suggest that the signal observed cannot in principle be
explained by a planet+ring system. We discuss, however, the possibility of
using reflected light spectra to detect and characterize the presence of rings
around short-period planets. Finally, we show that ring systems could have
already been detected by photometric transit campaigns, but their signal could
have been easily misinterpreted by the expected light curve of an eclipsing
binary.

explores the potential of a pulsed ps pulse duration high power free electron

strong background signal due to the direct heating of the probe, whereas the
AFM IR thermomechanical response allowed to eliminate such a problem for both

invertible transformations between Euclidean coordinate frames. In practice,
when the transformations are estimated from data, this property is lacking.
This work addresses the problem of synchronizing transformations that are not
transitively consistent. Once the transformations have been synchronized, they
satisfy the transitive consistency condition - a transformation from frame $A$
to frame $C$ is equal to the composite transformation of first transforming A
to B and then transforming B to C. The coordinate frames correspond to nodes in
a graph and the transformations correspond to edges in the same graph. Two
direct or centralized synchronization methods are presented for different graph
topologies; the first one for quasi-strongly connected graphs, and the second
one for connected graphs. As an extension of the second method, an iterative
Gauss-Newton method is presented, which is later adapted to the case of affine
and Euclidean transformations. Two distributed synchronization methods are also
presented for orthogonal matrices, which can be seen as distributed versions of
the two direct or centralized methods; they are similar in nature to standard
consensus protocols used for distributed averaging. When the transformations
are orthogonal matrices, a bound on the optimality gap can be computed.
Simulations show that the gap is almost right, even for noise large in
magnitude. This work also contributes on a theoretical level by providing
linear algebraic relationships for transitively consistent transformations. One
of the benefits of the proposed methods is their simplicity - basic linear
algebraic methods are used, e.g., the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). For a
wide range of parameter settings, the methods are numerically validated.

Three configurations with different degrees of cooperation among BSs are
considered: the coordinated beamforming scheme (only channel state information
is shared among BSs), the coordinated multipoint MIMO processing technology or
network MIMO (channel state and data cooperation), and a single cell
beamforming scheme (only local channel state information is used for
beamforming while channel state cooperation is needed for power allocation).
The analysis is conducted assuming that $N$ and $K$ grow large with a non
trivial ratio $K/N$ and imperfect channel state information (modeled by the
generic Gauss-Markov formulation form) is available at the BSs. Tools of random
matrix theory are used to compute, in explicit form, deterministic

needed to ensure target rates; and (iii) the total transmit power. These
results are instrumental to get further insight into the structure of the
optimal precoders and also to reduce the implementation complexity in
large-scale networks. Numerical results are used to validate the asymptotic
analysis in the finite system regime and to make comparisons among the
different configurations.

exoplanets may have weak magnetic fields, especially in the case of planets
more massive than Earth (super-Earths). Planetary magnetic fields, however,
constitute one of the shielding layers that protect the planet against
cosmic-ray particles. In particular, a weak magnetic field results in a high
flux of Galactic cosmic rays that extends to the top of the planetary
atmosphere. We wish to quantify the flux of Galactic cosmic rays to an
exoplanetary atmosphere as a function of the particle energy and of the
planetary magnetic moment. We numerically analyzed the propagation of Galactic
cosmic-ray particles through planetary magnetospheres. We evaluated the
efficiency of magnetospheric shielding as a function of the particle energy (in
the range 16 MeV $\le$ E $\le$ 524 GeV) and as a function of the planetary
magnetic field strength (in the range 0 ${M}_\oplus$ $\le$ {M} $\le$ 10
${M}_\oplus$). Combined with the flux outside the planetary magnetosphere, this
gives the cosmic-ray energy spectrum at the top of the planetary atmosphere as
a function of the planetary magnetic moment. We find that the particle flux to
the planetary atmosphere can be increased by more than three orders of
magnitude in the absence of a protecting magnetic field. For a weakly
magnetized planet (${M}=0.05\,{M}_{\oplus}$), only particles with energies
below 512 MeV are at least partially shielded. For a planet with a magnetic
moment similar to Earth, this limit increases to 32 GeV, whereas for a strongly
magnetized planet ($M=10.0\,{M}_{\oplus}$), partial shielding extends up to 200
GeV. We find that magnetic shielding strongly controls the number of cosmic-ray
particles reaching the planetary atmosphere. The implications of this increased
particle flux are discussed in a companion article.

the spectral curvature below 2 keV and the presence of two main spectral
states. From the spectral analysis we find that the observed variations can be
explained by the change of the intrinsic nuclear power (about a factor of 1.5)
coupled with a change of the properties of an ionized absorber. The quality of
the data prevents us from firmly establishing if the spectral variation is due
to a change in the ionization state and/or in the covering factor of the
absorbing medium. The latter scenario would imply a clumpy structure of the
ionized medium. By combining the information provided by the light curve and
the spectral analyses, we can derive some constraints on the location of the
absorber under the hypotheses of either homogeneous or clumpy medium. In both
cases, we find that the absorber should be located inside the outer edge of an

a sunspot taken at the 1-m SST, to determine the nature of flux emergence in a
light bridge and the processes related to its evolution in the photosphere and
chromosphere. Blueshifts of about 2 km/s are seen near the entrance of a
granular light bridge on the limbward side of the spot. They lie next to a
strongly redshifted patch that appeared 6 mins earlier. Both patches are seen
for 25 mins until the end of the sequence. The blueshifts coincide with an
elongated emerging granule, while the redshifts appear at the end of it. In the
photosphere, the development of the blueshifts is accompanied by a simultaneous
increase in field strength and inclination, with the field becoming nearly
horizontal. In the redshifted patch, the magnetic field is equally horizontal
but of opposite polarity. An intense brightening is seen in the Ca filtergrams
over these features, 17 mins after they emerge in the photosphere. The
brightening is due to emission in the blue wing of the Ca line, close to its
knee. Non-LTE inversions reveal that the asymmetric emission is caused by a
temperature enhancement of about 700 K between -5.0<log tau<-3.0 and a
blueshift of 3 km/s at log tau=-2.3. The photospheric blueshifts and redshifts
seem to be caused by the emergence of a small-scale, flat Omega-loop with
highly inclined footpoints of opposite polarity. The gas motions detected in
the two footpoints are reminiscent of a siphon flow. The rising loop is
probably confined to the lower atmosphere by the overlying sunspot magnetic
field and the subsequent interaction may be responsible for temperature
enhancements in the upper photosphere/lower chromosphere. This is the first
time that magnetic flux is observed to emerge in the strongly magnetised
environment of sunspots, pushed upward by the convective flows of a granular
light bridge.

local elimination of malaria, yet current diagnostic technologies are
insufficiently sensitive to identify all individuals who harbor infections. At
the same time, overtreatment of uninfected individuals increases the risk of
accelerating emergence of drug resistance and losing community acceptance.
Local heterogeneity in transmission intensity may allow campaign strategies
that respond to index cases to successfully target subpatent infections while
simultaneously limiting overtreatment. While selective targeting of hotspots of
transmission has been proposed as a strategy for malaria control, such
targeting has not been tested in the context of malaria elimination. Using
household locations, demographics, and prevalence data from a survey of four
health facility catchment areas in southern Zambia and an agent-based model of
malaria transmission and immunity acquisition, a transmission intensity was fit
to each household based on neighborhood age-dependent malaria prevalence. A set
of individual infection trajectories was constructed for every household in
each catchment area, accounting for heterogeneous exposure and immunity.
Various campaign strategies (mass drug administration, mass screen and treat,
focal mass drug administration, snowball reactive case detection, pooled
sampling, and a hypothetical serological diagnostic) were simulated and
evaluated for performance at finding infections, minimizing overtreatment,
reducing clinical case counts, and interrupting transmission. For malaria
control, presumptive treatment leads to substantial overtreatment without
additional morbidity reduction under all but the highest transmission
conditions. Selective targeting of hotspots with drug campaigns is an
ineffective tool for elimination due to limited sensitivity of available field
diagnostics.

distributed over different sites on the substrate. In the single cluster
relaxation model (RSC), the single cluster grows by the random accumulation of
rods on the boundary of the cluster. For both models, a suppression of growth
of the infinite cluster at some critical concentration of defects $d_c$ is
observed. In the zero defect lattices, the jamming concentration $p_j$ (RRSA)
and the density of single clusters $p_s$ (RSC) decrease with increasing length
rods and with a decrease in the order parameter. For the RRSA model, the value
of $d_c$ decreases for short rods as the value of $s$ increases. For longer
rods, the value of $d_c$ is almost independent of $s$. Moreover, for short
rods, the percolation threshold is almost insensitive to the defect
concentration for all values of $s$. For the RSC model, the growth of clusters
with ellipse-like shapes is observed for non-zero values of $s$. The density of
the clusters $p_s$ at the critical concentration of defects $d_c$ depends in a
complex manner on the values of $s$ and $k$. For disordered systems, the value
of $p_s$ tends towards zero in the limits of the very long rods and very small
critical concentrations $d_c \to 0$. In this case, the introduction of defects

velocity. These inhomogeneities arise as a consequence of a weak, secondary
lobe in the Stokes V profile which have a polarity opposite that of the sunspot
and very large (>5 km/s) Doppler velocities of both signs, suggesting two
distinct types of magnetic anomalies. These two sets of inhomogeneities are
highly time-dependent and appear exclusively in the upper half of the light
bridge and only after the light bridge is completely formed. Both sets of
inhomogeneities appear as patches and can be present independent of the other,
next to one another, or spatially separated in a single scan. A two-component
inversion of the corresponding spectral profiles indicate that the
inhomogeneities occupy a very small fraction, amounting to less than 10 %, of
the resolution element. These structures are likely driven by small-scale

open despite extensive research, and has been called ""the queen of problems in
evolutionary biology"". Theories dating back to Weismann have suggested that the
key must lie in the creation of increased variability in offspring, causing
enhanced response to selection. Rigorously quantifying the effects of assorted
mechanisms which might lead to such increased variability, and establishing
that these beneficial effects outweigh the immediate costs of sexual
reproduction has, however, proved problematic. Here we introduce an approach
which does not focus on particular mechanisms influencing factors such as the
fixation of beneficial mutants or the ability of populations to deal with
deleterious mutations, but rather tracks the entire distribution of a
population of genotypes as it moves across vast fitness landscapes. In this
setting simulations now show sex robustly outperforming asex across a broad
spectrum of finite or infinite population models. Concentrating on the additive
infinite populations model, we are able to give a rigorous mathematical proof
establishing that sexual reproduction acts as a more efficient optimiser of
mean fitness, thereby solving the problem for this model. Some of the key
features of this analysis carry through to the finite populations case.

states that all non-trivial zeroes of the Zeta function
$Z(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } n^{-s}$ should fall on the Critical Line (C.L.)
$Re(s)=\frac{1}{2}$.\\ Although direct numerical search of the zeroes failed to
identify any outlier, i.e. any zeroes with $Re(s)\neq\frac{1}{2}$, a general
proof of the Hypothesis has not yet been found.\\ The present Note aims to
approach the problem from a 'reductio ad absurdum' way, i.e. it assumes that an
outlier pair of c.c. zero-points, $s=\frac{1}{2}+\xi \pm i.Y_H$ with
$\xi\neq0$, has been found, and then proceeds to analyze what are the
implications of this assumption. Starting from the well-known GRAM-BACKLUND
formula for an explicit expression of the Zeta function, the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra (FTA) allows to evidence, through legitimate algebraic
manipulations, the necessity that the assumed outlying pair of c.c. zero-points
fulfils an implicit additional constraint. The zero-condition according to the
GRAM- BACKLUND formulation and this additional constraint are seen to be
mutually incompatible unless the pair of c.c. zero-points belong to the C.L..
This conclusion is equivalent to a verification of the RIEMANN Hypothesis.

reaction-diffusion equations. Hexagonal arrays, layers and their perturbations
are observed in different models after numerical solution to the corresponding
initial-boundary value problems. We demonstrate an intimate connection between
pattern formations and optimal random packing on the plane. The main study is
based on the following two points. First, the diffusive flux in
reaction-diffusion systems is approximated by piecewise linear functions in the
framework of structural approximations. This leads to a discrete network
approximation of the considered continuous problem. Second, the discrete energy
minimization yields optimal random packing of the domains (disks) in the
representative cell. Therefore, the general problem of pattern formations based
on the reaction-diffusion equations is reduced to the geometric problem of
random packing. It is demonstrated that all random packings can be divided onto
classes associated with classes of isomorphic graphs obtained form the Delaunay
triangulation. The unique optimal solution is constructed in each class of the
random packings. If the number of disks per representative cell is finite, the
number of classes of isomorphic graphs, hence, the number of optimal packings
is also finite.

where the driver, assumed to be faster than the evader, follows the evader but
cannot be arbitrarily close to it, and the evader tries to move away from the
driver beyond a short distance. The key ingredient allowing the driver to guide
the evader is that the driver is able to display a circumvention maneuver
around the evader, in such a way that the trajectory of the evader is modified
in the direction of the repulsion that the driver exerts on the evader. The
evader can thus be driven towards any given target or along a sufficiently
smooth path by controlling a single discrete parameter acting on driver's
behavior. The control parameter serves both to activate/deactivate the
circumvention mode and to select the clockwise/counterclockwise direction of
the circumvention maneuver. Assuming that the circumvention mode is more
expensive than the pursuit mode, and that the activation of the circumvention
mode has a high cost, we formulate an optimal control problem for the optimal
strategy to drive the evader to a given target. By means of numerical shooting
methods, we find the optimal open-loop control which reduces the number of
activations of the circumvention mode to one and which minimizes the time spent
in the active~mode. Our numerical simulations show that the system is highly
sensitive to small variations of the control function, and that the cost
function has a nonlinear regime which contributes to the complexity of the
behavior of the system, so that a general open-loop control would not be of
practical interest. We then propose a feedback control law that corrects from
deviations while preventing from an excesive use of the circumvention mode,
finding numerically that the feedback law significantly reduces the cost
obtained with the open-loop control.

observed ability of the Superior Colliculus to stochastically select between
similar stimuli, the accuracy of this selection depending on the
discriminability of the target and the distractors. Our model also offers an
explanation for the phenomenon of Remote Distractor Effect based on the lateral
connectivity within the Basal Ganglia circuitry rather than on lateral
inhibitions within the collicular maps. Finally, we propose a role for the
