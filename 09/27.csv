transmission methods based on known-interference cancellation (KIC) have been
developed. These methods share the common idea that the interference can be
cancelled when the content of it is known. Existing work on KIC mainly focuses
on single-hop or two-hop networks, with physical-layer network coding (PNC) and
full-duplex (FD) communications as typical examples. This paper extends the
idea of KIC to general multi-hop networks, and proposes an end-to-end KIC
(E2E-KIC) transmission method together with its MAC design. With E2E-KIC,
multiple nodes in a flow passing through a few nodes in an arbitrary topology
can simultaneously transmit and receive on the same channel. We first present a
theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of E2E-KIC in an idealized case.
Then, to support E2E-KIC in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology, we
propose an E2E-KIC-supported MAC protocol (E2E-KIC MAC), which is based on an
extension of the Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send (RTS/CTS) mechanism in the IEEE
802.11 MAC. We also analytically analyze the performance of the proposed
E2E-KIC MAC in the presence of hidden terminals. Simulation results illustrate
that the proposed E2E-KIC MAC protocol can improve the network throughput and
reduce the end-to-end delay.

(f <-> ~f) are not contradictions, and that formulas of the form (t <-> t) are
not tautologies. Such formulas, wherever they appear in mathematics, are
instead reason to conclude that f and t have a third truth value, different
from true and false. These formulas are circular definitions of f and t. We can
interpret the implication formula (f <-> ~f) as a rule, a procedure, to find
the truth value of f on the left side: we just need to find the truth value of
f on the right side. When we use the rules to ask if f and t are true or false,
we need to keep asking if they are true or false over and over, forever.
  Russell's paradox and the liar paradox have the form (f <-> ~f). The truth
value provides a straightforward means of avoiding contradictions in these
problems. One broad consequence is that the technique of proof by contradiction
involving formulas of the form (f <-> ~f) becomes invalid. One such proof by
contradiction is one form of proof that the halting problem is uncomputable.
The truth value also appears in Cantor's diagonal argument, Berry's paradox,
and the Grelling-Nelson paradox.

lattice strain significantly modifies the electronic and optical properties of
these devices. A universal behavior is observed in atomistic strain simulations
(in terms of both strain magnitude and profile) of QDs with different shapes
and materials. In this paper, this universal behavior is investigated by
atomistic as well as analytic continuum models. Atomistic strain simulations
are very accurate but computationally expensive. On the other hand, analytic
continuum solutions are based on assumptions that significantly reduce the
accuracy of the strain calculations, but are very fast. Both techniques
indicate that the strain depends on the aspect ratio (AR) of the QDs, and not
on the individual dimensions. Thus simple closed form equations are introduced
which directly provide the atomistic strain values inside the QD as a function
of the AR and the material parameters. Moreover, the conduction and valence
band edges $E_{C/V}$ and their effective masses $m^*_{C/V}$ of the QDs are
dictated by the strain and AR consequently. The universal dependence of
atomistic strain on the AR is useful in many ways; Not only does it reduce the
computational cost of atomistic simulations significantly, but it also provides
information about the optical transitions of QDs given the knowledge of
$E_{C/V}$ and $m^*_{C/V}$ from AR. Finally, these expressions are used to
calculate optical transition wavelengths in InAs/GaAs QDs and the results agree
well with experimental measurements and atomistic simulations.

the high mechanical stability of structures under high tensile stress to
minimize thermal buckling effects and maintain small separations at large

secondary user (SU) to a spectrum occupied by an incumbent primary user (PU)
that employs Type-I Hybrid ARQ. The technique allows the SU to perform
selective retransmissions of SU data packets that have not been successfully
decoded in the previous attempts. The temporal redundancy introduced by the PU
ARQ protocol and by the selective retransmission process of the SU can be
exploited by the SU receiver to perform interference cancellation (IC) over
multiple transmission slots, thus creating a ""clean"" channel for the decoding
of the concurrent SU or PU packets. The chain decoding technique is initiated
by a successful decoding operation of a SU or PU packet and proceeds by an
iterative application of IC in order to decode the buffered signals that
represent packets that could not be decoded before. Based on this scheme, an
optimal policy is designed that maximizes the SU throughput under a constraint
on the average long-term PU performance. The optimality of the chain decoding
protocol is proved, which determines which packet the SU should send at a given
time. Moreover, a decoupling principle is proved, which establishes the
optimality of decoupling the secondary access strategy from the chain decoding
protocol. Specifically, first, the SU access policy, optimized via dynamic
programming, specifies whether the SU should access the channel or not, based
on a compact state representation of the protocol; and second, the chain
decoding protocol embeds four basic rules that are used to determine which
packet should be transmitted by the SU. Chain decoding provably yields the
maximum improvement that can be achieved by any scheme under our assumptions,
and thus it is the ultimate scheme, which completely closes the gap between
previous schemes and optimality.

for any system exists a function of the system's extensive parameters, called
entropy, defined for all equilibrium states and having the property that the
values assumed by the extensive parameters in the absence of a constraint are
those that maximize the entropy over the manifold of constrained equilibrium
states. By analyzing the evolution of systems of positive and negative absolute
temperatures, we show that this postulate is satisfied by the Boltzmann formula
for the entropy and is violated by the Gibbs formula. Therefore the Gibbs
formula is not a generally valid expression for the entropy.
  Viceversa, if we assume, by reductio ad absurdum, that for some thermodynamic
systems the equilibrium state is determined by the Gibbs' prescription and not
by Boltzmann's, this implies that such systems have macroscopic fluctuations
and therefore do not reach thermodynamic equilibrium.

has since been extended to an all-sky survey using the Isaac Newton Telescope.
In this first paper in the series, we introduce the overall project and present

of equivalent-width measurements of the DIBs at 5780, 5797, 5850, 6196, 6203,

\AA, and the stellar He\,{\sc i} line at 5876 \AA. We find that the 5780 \AA\
DIB is relatively strong throughout, as compared to the 5797 \AA\ DIB, but
especially within the Local Bubble and at the interface with more neutral
medium. The 6203 \AA\ DIB shows a similar behaviour, but with respect to the
6196 \AA\ DIB. Some nearby stars show surprisingly strong DIBs whereas some
distant stars show very weak DIBs, indicating small-scale structure within as
well as outside the Local Bubble. The sight-lines with non-detections trace the
extent of the Local Bubble especially clearly, and show it opening out into the
Halo. The Local Bubble has a wall which is in contact with hot gas and/or a
harsh interstellar radiation field. That wall is perforated though, causing
leakage of radiation and possibly hot gas. On the other hand, compact
self-shielded cloudlets are present much closer to the Sun, probably within the
Local Bubble itself. As for the carriers of the DIBs, our observations confirm
the notion that these are large molecules, whose differences in behaviour are
mainly governed by their differing resilience and/or electrical charge, with
more subtle differences possibly related to varying excitation.

excitation energies vary quadratically with the inverse of the range-separation

which is usually applied to long-range interacting energies, can be adapted
straightforwardly to LIM. This extrapolated LIM (ELIM) has been tested on a
small test set consisting of He, Be, H2 and HeH+. Relatively accurate results
have been obtained for the first singlet excitation energies with the typical
mu=0.4 value. The improvement of LIM after extrapolation is remarkable, in
particular for the doubly-excited 2^1Sigma+g state in the stretched H2
molecule. Three-state ensemble calculations in H2 also show that ELIM does not
necessarily improves relative excitation energies, even though individual
excitation energies are more accurate after extrapolation. Finally, an
alternative decomposition of the short-range ensemble exchange-correlation
energy is proposed in order to correct for ghost-interaction errors in
multideterminant range-separated ensemble density-functional theory

techniques have successfully modified static surface properties such as surface
color, dynamic range, gloss and shading. Here, we propose an alternative light
projection technique that adds a variety of illusory, yet realistic distortions
to a wide range of static 2D and 3D projection targets. The key idea of our
technique, named Deformation Lamps, is to project only dynamic luminance
information, which effectively activates the motion (and shape) processing in
the visual system, while preserving the color and texture of the original
object. Although the projected dynamic luminance information is spatially
inconsistent with the color and texture of the target object, the observer's
brain automatically com- bines these sensory signals in such a way as to
correct the inconsistency across visual attributes. We conducted a
psychophysical experiment to investigate the characteristics of the
inconsistency correction, and found that the correction was dependent
critically on the retinal magnitude of inconsistency. Another experiment showed
that perceived magnitude of image deformation by our techniques was
underestimated. The results ruled out the possibility that the effect by our
technique stemmed simply from the physical change of object appearance by light
projection. Finally, we discuss how our techniques can make the observers
perceive a vivid and natural movement, deformation, or oscillation of a variety
of static objects, including drawn pictures, printed photographs, sculptures
with 3D shading, objects with natural textures including human bodies.

usually requires many tedious tricks and much expertise to tune. However,
filters learned by these complex architectures are quite similar to standard
hand-crafted features visually. In this paper, unsupervised learning methods,
such as PCA or auto-encoder, are employed as the building block to learn filter
banks at each layer. The lower layer responses are transferred to the last
layer (trans-layer) to form a more complete representation retaining more
information. In addition, some beneficial methods such as local contrast
normalization and whitening are added to the proposed deep trans-layer networks
to further boost performance. The trans-layer representations are followed by
block histograms with binary encoder schema to learn translation and rotation
invariant representations, which are utilized to do high-level tasks such as
recognition and classification. Compared to traditional deep learning methods,
the implemented feature learning method has much less parameters and is
validated in several typical experiments, such as digit recognition on MNIST

verification on LFW dataset. The deep trans-layer unsupervised learning

we assume that when the parameter is forced to switch between the two discrete
values, trajectories become discontinuous. Discontinuous trajectories exist in
systems whose domain of definition is non-dense. It is shown that under our
assumptions the trajectories of such PWS systems have unique forward-time
continuation when the parameter of the system switches. A finite-dimensional
reduced order model is constructed, which accounts for the discontinuous
trajectories. It is shown that this model retains uniqueness of solutions and
other properties of the original PWS system. The model reduction technique is
illustrated on a nonlinear bowed string model.

easily blocked by obstacles such as human body and furniture. In this paper, we
develop a Multi-Hop Relaying Transmission scheme, termed as MHRT, to steer
blocked flows around obstacles by establishing multi-hop relay paths. InMHRT, a
relay path selection algorithmis proposed to establish relay paths for blocked
flows for better use of concurrent transmissions. After relay path selection,
we use a multi-hop transmission scheduling algorithm to compute near-optimal

and can be used as cosmic chronometers to estimate the Hubble constant.
However, different LRGs may be located in different environments. The
environmental effects may limit the use of the LRGs as cosmic chronometers. We
aim to investigate the environmental and mass dependence of the formation of
'quiescent' LRGs selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Date Release 8 and
to pave the way for using LRGs as cosmic chronometers. Using the population
synthesis software STARLIGHT, we derive the stellar populations in each LRG
through the full spectrum fitting and obtain the mean age distribution and the
mean star formation history (SFH) of those LRGs. We find that there is no
apparent dependence of the mean age and the SFH of quiescent LRGs on their
environment, while the ages of those quiescent LRGs depend weakly on their
mass. We compare the SFHs of the SDSS LRGs with those obtained from a
semi-analytical galaxy formation model, and find that they are roughly
consistent with each other if we consider the errors in the STARLIGHT-derived
ages. We find that a small fraction of later star formation in LRGs leads to a
systematical overestimation (~28 %) of the Hubble constant by the differential
age method, and the systematical errors in the STARLIGHT-derived ages may lead
to an underestimation (~ 16 %) of the Hubble constant. However, these errors
can be corrected by a detailed study of the mean SFH of those LRGs and by
calibrating the STARLIGHT-derived ages to those obtained independently by other
methods. The environmental effects do not play significant role in the age
estimates of quiescent LRGs, and the quiescent LRGs as a population can be used
securely as cosmic chronometers.

disjoint orbits. For a product of two chains, Propp and Roby observed ---
across orbits --- the mean cardinality of the order ideals within an orbit to
be invariant. That this phenomenon, which they christened homomesy, extends to
all minuscule posets is shown herein.
  Given a minuscule poset $P$, there exists a complex simple Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{g}$ and a representation $V$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ such that the lattice
of order ideals of $P$ coincides with the weight lattice of $V$. For a weight
$\mu$ with corresponding order ideal $I$, it is demonstrated that the behavior
of the Weyl group simple reflections on $\mu$ not only uniquely determines
$\mu$, but also encodes the cardinality of $I$. After recourse to work of Rush
and Shi mapping the anatomy of the lattice isomorphism, the upshot is a uniform
proof that the cardinality statistic exhibits homomesy.
  A further application of these ideas shows that the statistic tracking the
number of maximal elements in an order ideal is also homomesic, extending
another result of Propp and Roby.

solution becomes one of the most urgent and critical challenges. With vast
amounts of spectrum available, wireless backhaul in the millimeter wave

high propagation loss at higher frequencies, mmWave backhaul utilize
beamforming to achieve directional transmission, and concurrent transmissions
(spatial reuse) under low inter-link interference can be enabled to
significantly improve network capacity. To achieve an energy efficient solution
for the mmWave backhauling of small cells, we first formulate the problem of
minimizing the energy consumption via concurrent transmission scheduling and
power control into a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. Then we
develop an energy efficient and practical mmWave backhauling scheme, where the
maximum independent set based scheduling algorithm and the power control
algorithm are proposed to exploit the spatial reuse for low energy consumption
and high energy efficiency. We also theoretically analyze the conditions that
our scheme reduces energy consumption, and the choice of the interference
threshold for energy reduction. Through extensive simulations under various
traffic patterns and system parameters, we demonstrate the superior performance
of our scheme in terms of energy consumption and energy efficiency, and also
analyze the choice of the interference threshold under different traffic loads,
BS distributions, and the maximum transmission power.

eigenvectors that depict the embedding of the local neighborhood structure
around seeds of interest. We then seek a sparse approximate indicator vector in
the local spectral subspace spanned by these vectors such that the seeds are in
its support.
  We evaluate LOSP on five large real world networks across various domains
with labeled ground-truth communities and compare the results with the
state-of-the-art community detection approaches. LOSP identifies the members of
a target community with high accuracy from very few seed members, and
outperforms the local Heat Kernel or PageRank diffusions as well as the global
baselines.
  Two candidate definitions of the local spectral subspace are analyzed, and
different community scoring functions for determining the community boundary,
including two new metrics, are thoroughly evaluated. The structural properties
of different seed sets and the impact of the seed set size are discussed. We
observe low degree seeds behave better, and LOSP is robust even when started
from a single random seed.
  Using LOSP as a subroutine and starting from each ego connected component, we
try the harder yet significant task of identifying all communities a single
vertex is in. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves high F1
measures on the detected multiple local overlapping communities containing the

captures both structural and appearance variations of a target object in a
principled way. The TLP method is formulated in the Bayesian framework with a
spatial and a temporal dynamic programming (DP) algorithms inferring object
bounding boxes on-the-fly. During online learning, the AOG is discriminatively
learned using latent SVM to account for appearance (e.g., lighting and partial
occlusion) and structural (e.g., different poses and viewpoints) variations of
a tracked object, as well as distractors (e.g., similar objects) in background.
Three key issues in online inference and learning are addressed: (i)
maintaining purity of positive and negative examples collected online, (ii)
controling model complexity in latent structure learning, and (iii) identifying
critical moments to re-learn the structure of AOG based on its intrackability.
The intrackability measures uncertainty of an AOG based on its score maps in a
frame. In experiments, our AOGTracker is tested on two popular tracking
benchmarks with the same parameter setting: the TB-100/50/CVPR2013 benchmarks,
and the VOT benchmarks --- VOT 2013, 2014, 2015 and TIR2015 (thermal imagery

base code is a time consuming process. Parallel compilation of code will help
in reducing the time complexity. Parsing is one of the phases in compiler in
which significant amount of time of compilation is spent. Techniques have
already been developed to extract the parallelism available in parser. Current
LR(k) parallel parsing techniques either face difficulty in creating Abstract
Syntax Tree or requires modification in the grammar or are specific to less
expressive grammars. Most of the programming languages like C, ALGOL are
block-structured, and in most languages grammars the grammar of different
blocks is independent, allowing different blocks to be parsed in parallel. We
are proposing a block level parallel parser derived from Incremental Jump Shift
Reduce Parser by [13]. Block Parallelized Parser (BPP) can even work as a block
parallel incremental parser. We define a set of Incremental Categories and
create the partitions of a grammar based on a rule. When parser reaches the
start of the block symbol it will check whether the current block is related to
any incremental category. If block parallel parser find the incremental
category for it, parser will parse the block in parallel. Block parallel parser
is developed for LR(1) grammar. Without making major changes in Shift Reduce
(SR) LR(1) parsing algorithm, block parallel parser can create an Abstract
Syntax tree easily. We believe this parser can be easily extended to LR (k)
grammars and also be converted to an LALR (1) parser. We implemented BPP and SR
LR(1) parsing algorithm for C Programming Language. We evaluated performance of
both techniques by parsing 10 random files from Linux Kernel source. BPP showed
28% and 52% improvement in the case of including header files and excluding

the two solstices (during the year). We estimate the latter contributions using
asymptotical methods and discuss the prospects of their isolation, i.e.,
magnification, by contraction of the neutrino observation term to small
neighborhoods of the localization points. In order to complement our
asymptotical predictions derived analytically, we also perform a full numerical
analysis of a temporally-weighted observation of the day-night effect,
including the energy spectrum of the day-night asymmetry and an estimation of

According to both analytical and numerical results, it turns out that a
weighted observation is able to magnify the amplitude of the peculiar

Bayesian inference when the likelihood is computationally intractable. However,
a drawback of ABC is that it is an approximate method that induces a systematic
error because it is necessary to set a tolerance level to make the computation
tractable. The issue of how to optimally set this tolerance level has been the
subject of extensive research. This paper proposes an ABC algorithm based on
importance sampling that estimates expectations with respect to the ""exact""
posterior distribution given the observed summary statistics. This overcomes
the need to select the tolerance level. By ""exact"" we mean that there is no
systematic error and the Monte Carlo error can be made arbitrarily small by
increasing the number of importance samples. We provide a formal justification
for the method and study its convergence properties. The method is illustrated
in two applications and the empirical results suggest that the proposed ABC

importance samples increases. Our proposed approach can be applied more
generally to any importance sampling problem where an unbiased estimate of the

well-established median filter for grey-value images to multi-channel images.
As multivariate median, most of the recent approaches use the $L^1$ median,
i.e.\ the minimiser of an objective function that is the sum of distances to
all input points. Many properties of univariate median filters generalise to
such a filter. However, the famous result by Guichard and Morel about
approximation of the mean curvature motion PDE by median filtering does not
have a comparably simple counterpart for $L^1$ multivariate median filtering.
We discuss the affine equivariant Oja median and the affine equivariant
transformation--retransformation $L^1$ median as alternatives to $L^1$ median
filtering. We analyse multivariate median filters in a space-continuous
setting, including the formulation of a space-continuous version of the
transformation--retransformation $L^1$ median, and derive PDEs approximated by
these filters in the cases of bivariate planar images, three-channel volume
images and three-channel planar images. The PDEs for the affine equivariant
filters can be interpreted geometrically as combinations of a diffusion and a
principal-component-wise curvature motion contribution with a cross-effect term
based on torsions of principal components. Numerical experiments are presented
that demonstrate the validity of the approximation results.

highest possible sensitivities, gravity gradients pose a serious challenge.
Indeed, the relative initial position and velocity for the two species need to
be controlled with extremely high accuracy, which can be rather demanding in
practice and whose verification may require rather long integration times.
Furthermore, in highly sensitive configurations gravity gradients lead to a
drastic loss of contrast. These difficulties can be mitigated by employing wave
packets with narrower position and momentum widths, but this is ultimately
limited by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We present a novel scheme that
simultaneously overcomes the loss of contrast and the initial co-location
problem. In doing so, it circumvents the fundamental limitations due to

relaxing the requirements on initial co-location by several orders of

scale structure formation very well. However, a number of puzzling observations
remain on galactic scales. An example is the anisotropic distribution of
satellite galaxies in the Local Group. This has led to suggestions that a
modified gravity theory might provide a better explanation than Newtonian
gravity supplemented by dark matter. One of the leading modified gravity
theories is Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). For an isolated point mass, it
boosts gravity by an acceleration-dependent factor of $\nu$.
  Recently, a much more computer-friendly quasi-linear formulation of MOND
(QUMOND) has become available. We investigate analytically the solution for a
point mass embedded in a constant external field of $\mathbf{g}_{ext}$. We find
that the potential is $\Phi = - ~ \frac{GM \nu_{ext}}{r}\left(1 + \frac{K_0}{2}
\sin^2 \theta \right)$, where $r$ is distance from the mass $M$ which is in an
external field that `saturates' the $\nu$ function at the value $\nu_{ext}$,
leading to a fixed value of $K_0 \equiv \frac{\partial Ln ~ \nu}{\partial Ln ~
g_{ext}}$. In a very weak gravitational field $\left(\left| \mathbf{g}_{ext}
\right| \ll a_0 \right)$, $K_0 = -\frac{1}{2}$. The angle $\theta$ is that
between the external field direction and the direction towards the mass.
  Our results are quite close to the more traditional aquadratic Lagrangian
(AQUAL) formulation of MOND. We apply both theories to a simple model of the

tidal stream seeming to spread slightly further in AQUAL.

radiation in ($2+1$)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. The exterior
spacetime of the collapsing star is assumed to be described by the non-static
generalization of the Ba\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli [{\em Phys. Rev. Lett.}

smoothly the interior and the exterior spacetimes across the boundary, we
analyze the impacts of various factors on the evolution of the star which
begins its collapse from an initial static configuration. In particular,
depending on initial conditions, two possible outcomes of the collapse process
are shown: (i) formation of a BTZ black hole, and (ii) evaporation of all
mass-energy even before the singularity is reached.

canonical scalar field. After reviewing the basic equations governing the
background cosmology in $f(T)$-gravity, we turn to study the cosmological
perturbations and obtain the evolutionary equations for the scalar and tensor
perturbations. Solving those equations, we find the power spectra for the
scalar and tensor perturbations. Then, we consider a power-law form for the
$f(T)$ function in the action and examine the inflationary models with the
power-law and intermediate scale factors. We see that in contrast with the
standard inflationary scenario based on the Einstein gravity, in the considered
$f(T)$-gravity scenario, the power-law and intermediate inflationary models can
be compatible with the observational results of Planck 2015 at 68\% CL. In our
$f(T)$-gravity setting, the potentials responsible for both the power-law and
intermediate inflationary models have the power-law form $V(\phi ) \propto
{\phi ^m}$ but the power $m$ is different for them. Therefore, we can refine
some of power-law inflationary potentials in the framework of $f(T)$-gravity
while they are disfavored by the observational data in the standard
inflationary scenario. Interestingly enough, the self-interacting quartic
potential $V(\phi ) \propto {\phi ^4}$ which has special reheating properties,
can be consistent with the Planck 2015 data in our $f(T)$-gravity scenario
while it is ruled out in the standard inflationary scenario.

Tracy and Dmitriy Zhigunov","Hawking Radiation and Classical Tunneling","24 pages, 2 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn gr-qc physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Acoustic waves in fluids undergoing the transition from sub- to supersonic
flow satisfy governing equations similar to those for light waves in the
immediate vicinity of a black hole event horizon. This acoustic analogy has
been used by Unruh and others as a conceptual model for `Hawking radiation.'
Here we use variational methods, originally introduced by Brizard for the study
of linearized MHD, and ray phase space methods, to analyze linearized acoustics
in the presence of background flows. The variational formulation endows the
evolution equations with natural Hermitian and symplectic structures that prove
useful for later analysis. We derive a $2\times 2$ normal form governing the
wave evolution in the vicinity of the `event horizon.' This shows that the
acoustic model can be reduced locally (in ray phase space) to a standard
(scalar) tunneling process weakly coupled to a unidirectional non-dispersive
wave (the `incoming wave'). Given the normal form, the Hawking `thermal
spectrum' can be derived by invoking standard tunneling theory, but only by
ignoring the coupling to the incoming wave. Deriving the normal form requires a
novel extension of the modular ray-based theory used previously to study
tunneling and mode conversion in plasmas. We also discuss how ray phase space
methods can be used to change representation, which brings the problem into a
form where the wave functions are less singular than in the usual formulation,
a fact that might prove useful in numerical studies.

  Couple Stress Elasticity","31 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Beginning with Cosserat theory in the early 20th century, there have been
several different formulations for size-dependent elastic response. In this
paper, we concentrate on the application of classical Cauchy theory and the
recent parsimonious consistent couple stress theory to model a homogeneous
linear elastic solid, exemplified by a pure single crystal with cubic
structure. The focus is on an examination of elastodynamic response based upon
wave velocities from ultrasonic excitation and phonon dispersion curves, along
with adiabatic bulk moduli measurements. In particular, we consider in detail
elastic parameter estimation within classical elasticity and consistent couple
stress theory for four different cubic single crystals (NaCl, KCl, Cu, CuZn).
The classical theory requires the estimation of three independent material
parameters, while only one additional parameter relating skew-symmetric mean
curvature to skew-symmetric couple-stress is needed for the size-dependent
consistent couple stress theory. This additional parameter can be defined for
cubic crystals in terms of a material length scale, which is found to be on the
order of tens of microns for the four materials studied here. Furthermore, a
detailed statistical investigation provides strong to very strong evidence that
couple stress theory is superior to classical Cauchy elasticity for
representing the wave velocities and adiabatic bulk moduli for all four single
crystals.
