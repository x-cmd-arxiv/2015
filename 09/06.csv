  We obtained medium-resolution spectra of 22 brown dwarfs with these

  We aimed to identify brown dwarf binary candidates, and to test if the
BT-Settl 2014 atmospheric models reproduce their observed spectra.
  To find binaries spanning the L-T boundary, we used spectral indices and
compared the spectra of the selected candidates to single spectra and synthetic
binary spectra. We used synthetic binary spectra with components of same
spectral type to determine as well the sensitivity of the method to this class
of binaries.
  We identified three candidates to be combination of L plus T brown dwarfs. We
are not able to identify binaries with components of similar spectral type. In
our sample, we measured minimum binary fraction of $9.1^{+9.9}_{-3.0}$.
  From the best fit of the BT-Settl models 2014 to the observed spectra, we
derived the atmospheric parameters for the single objects. The BT-Settl models
were able to reproduce the majority of the SEDs from our objects, and the
variation of the equivalent width of the RbI (794.8 nm) and CsI (852.0 nm)

evolution of the equivalent widths of the NaI (818.3 nm and 819.5 nm) and KI

problem. Different from the traditional domain adaption methods which rely on a
global domain shift for all classes between source and target domain, the
proposed method is more flexible to capture individual class variations across
domains. By adopting a natural and widely used assumption -- ""the data samples
from the same class should lay on a low-dimensional subspace, even if they come
from different domains"", the proposed method circumvents the limitation of the
global domain shift, and solves the cross-domain recognition by finding the
compact joint subspaces of source and target domain. Specifically, given
labeled samples in source domain, we construct subspaces for each of the
classes. Then we construct subspaces in the target domain, called anchor
subspaces, by collecting unlabeled samples that are close to each other and
highly likely all fall into the same class. The corresponding class label is
then assigned by minimizing a cost function which reflects the overlap and
topological structure consistency between subspaces across source and target
domains, and within anchor subspaces, respectively.We further combine the
anchor subspaces to corresponding source subspaces to construct the compact
joint subspaces. Subsequently, one-vs-rest SVM classifiers are trained in the
compact joint subspaces and applied to unlabeled data in the target domain. We
evaluate the proposed method on two widely used datasets: object recognition
dataset for computer vision tasks, and sentiment classification dataset for
natural language processing tasks. Comparison results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms the comparison methods on both datasets.

the sign of the Goldstone boson interaction in the pressure, staggered
magnetization, and susceptibility as a function of an external staggered field
for general $N$. As it turns out, the $d$=2+1 quantum XY model ($N$=2) and the
$d$=2+1 Heisenberg antiferromagnet ($N$=3), are rather special, as they
represent the only cases where the spin-wave interaction in the pressure is
repulsive in the whole parameter regime where the effective expansion applies.
Remarkably, the $d$=2+1 XY model is the only system where the interaction
contribution in the staggered magnetization (susceptibility) tends to positive
(negative) values at low temperatures and weak external field.

IIP from the literature, we derive $UBVRIJHK$ bolometric calibrations from

determined by modeling the spectra in the vicinity of Fe II $\lambda5169$
whenever observed, and interpolating at photometric epochs based on a
semianalytic method. This gives $v_{\rm ph} = 4500\pm500$ km s$^{-1}$ at +50

the expanding photosphere method, from combined analysis of SN 2013ej and SN
2002ap, we estimate the distance to the host galaxy to be $9.0_{-0.6}^{+0.4}$

Bessel functions $I_j(x)$ of the first kind, which are Laurent series
coefficients of the analytic function family $e^{\frac x2(z+\frac 1z)}$. For
every $l\geq1$ we study the family parametrized by $k, n\in\mathbb Z^l$,
$k_1>\dots>k_l$, $n_1>\dots>n_l$ of $(l\times l)$-matrix functions formed by
the modified Bessel functions of the first kind $a_{ij}(x)=I_{k_j-n_i}(x)$,
$i,j=1,\dots,l$. We show that their determinants $f_{k,n}(x)$ are positive for
every $l\geq1$, $k,n\in\mathbb Z^l$ as above and $x>0$. The above determinants
are closely related to a sequence (indexed by $l$) of families of double
confluent Heun equations, which are linear second order differential equations
with two irregular singularities, at zero and at infinity. V.M.Buchstaber and
S.I.Tertychnyi have constructed their holomorphic solutions on $\mathbb C$ for
an explicit class of parameter values and conjectured that they do not exist
for other parameter values. They have reduced their conjecture to the second
conjecture saying that if an appropriate second similar equation has a
polynomial solution, then the first one has no entire solution. They have
proved the latter statement under the additional assumption (third conjecture)
that $f_{k,n}(x)\neq0$ for $k=(l,\dots,1)$, $n=(l-1,\dots,0)$ and every $x>0$.
Our more general result implies all the above conjectures, together with their

mineral aggregates is used in the construction of nuclear power plants (NPPs),
e.g., to construct the reactor cavity concrete that encases the reactor
pressure vessel, etc. In such environments, concrete may be exposed to
radiation (e.g., neutrons) emanating from the reactor core. Until recently,
concrete has been assumed relatively immune to radiation exposure. Direct
evidence acquired on Ar$^+$-ion irradiated calcite and quartz indicates, on the
contrary, that, such minerals, which constitute aggregates in concrete, may be
significantly altered by irradiation. Specifically, while quartz undergoes
disordering of its atomic structure resulting in a near complete lack of
periodicity, i.e., similar to glassy silica, calcite only experiences random
rotations, and distortions of its carbonate groups. As a result, irradiated
quartz shows a reduction in density of around 15%, and an increase in chemical
reactivity, described by its dissolution rate, similar to a glassy silica;
i.e., an increase of around 3 orders of magnitude. Calcite however, shows
little change in dissolution rates - although its density noted to reduce by
around 9%. These differences are correlated with the nature of bonds in these
minerals, i.e., being dominantly ionic or covalent, and the rigidity of the
mineral's atomic network that is characterized by the number of topological
constraints (n$_c$) that are imposed on the atoms in the network. The outcomes
are discussed within the context of the durability of concrete structural
elements formed with calcitic/quartzitic aggregates in nuclear power plants.

modified after inflation due to heavy field dynamics. During inflation there
may be a heavy scalar field stabilized at a value deviated from the low-energy
minimum. As the heavy field moves to the low-energy minimum, the inflaton
potential could be significantly modified. In extreme cases, the inflaton
potential vanishes and the inflaton becomes almost massless at some time after
inflation. Such transition of the inflaton potential has interesting
implications for primordial density perturbations, reheating, creation of
unwanted relics, dark radiation, and experimental search for light degrees of
freedom. To be concrete, we consider a chaotic inflation in supergravity where
the inflaton mass parameter is promoted to a modulus field, finding that the
inflaton becomes stable after the transition and contributes to dark matter.
Another example is the new inflation by the MSSM Higgs field which acquires a
large expectation value just after inflation, but it returns to the origin
after the transition and settles down at the electroweak vacuum. Interestingly,
the smallness of the electroweak scale compared to the Planck scale is directly
related to the flatness of the inflaton potential.

particular, existence of physical properties that are independent of the

known as contextuality. This paper studies whether the process of decay in
space-time generally destroys the ability of revealing contextuality. We find
that in the most general situation the decay property does not diminish this
ability. However, applying certain constraints due to the space-time structure
either on the time evolution of the decaying system or on the measurement
procedure, the criteria revealing contextuality become inherently dependent on
the decay property or an impossibility. In particular, we derive how the

We argue that this state is inherently unstable towards spontaneous formation
of a (topological) excitonic insulator. The instability can be parameterized by
a critical fermion number $N_c$. For $N < N_c$ the rotational symmetry is
spontaneously broken, the system develops a gap in the spectrum, and features a
finite nematic order parameter. To leading order in the 1/N expansion and in
the static approximation, the analogy with the problem of dynamical mass
generation in (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics yields $N_c =
16/[3\pi(\pi-2)]$. Taking the important dynamical screening effects into
account, we find that $N_c \geq 2.6(2)$ and therefore safely above the physical
value of $N = 1$. Some experimental consequences of the nematic ground state

effective forecasts of nonlinear time series. The first step in this process is
the estimation of good values for two parameters, the time delay and the
embedding dimension. Many heuristics and strategies have been proposed in the
literature for estimating these values. Few, if any, of these methods were
developed with forecasting in mind, however, and their results are not optimal
for that purpose. Even so, these heuristics---intended for other
applications---are routinely used when building delay coordinate
reconstruction-based forecast models. In this paper, we propose a new strategy
for choosing optimal parameter values for forecast methods that are based on
delay-coordinate reconstructions. The basic calculation involves maximizing the
shared information between each delay vector and the future state of the
system. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method on several synthetic and
experimental systems, showing that this metric can be calculated quickly and
reliably from a relatively short time series, and that it provides a direct
indication of how well a near-neighbor based forecasting method will work on a
given delay reconstruction of that time series. This allows a practitioner to
choose reconstruction parameters that avoid any pathologies, regardless of the
underlying mechanism, and maximize the predictive information contained in the
reconstruction.

The presence of charge disorder on the apposed bounding surfaces of the slabs

also, in particular, their coupling with multivalent ions, give rise to a more
diverse behavior for the effective interaction between net-neutral slabs.
Disorder effects show large variation depending on the properly quantified
strength of disorder, leading either to non-monotonic effective interaction
with both repulsive and attractive branches when the surface charges are weakly
disordered (small disorder variance) or to a dominating attractive interaction
that is larger both in its range and magnitude than what is predicted from the
van der Waals and image-induced, ion-depletion interactions, when the surfaces
are strongly disordered (large disorder variance).

a system clearly different from those found in previous high-$z$ overdensity

of available pilot sequences in the network, respectively, with $B = \beta K$,
where $\beta \ge 1 $ is called the pilot reuse factor. The novelty of the
multi-cell MMSE detector is that it utilizes all $B$ channel directions that
can be estimated locally at a base station, so that intra-cell interference,
parts of the inter-cell interference and the noise can all be actively
suppressed, while conventional detectors only use the $K$ intra-cell channels.
Furthermore, in the large-system limit, a deterministic equivalent expression
of the uplink SINR for the proposed multi-cell MMSE is derived. The expression
is easy to compute and accounts for power control for the pilot and payload,
imperfect channel estimation and arbitrary pilot allocation. Numerical results
show that significant sum spectral efficiency gains can be obtained by the
multi-cell MMSE over the conventional single-cell MMSE and the recent
multi-cell ZF, and the gains become more significant as $\beta$ and/or $K$
increases. Furthermore, the deterministic equivalent is shown to be very
accurate even for relatively small system dimensions.

orthogonal pilot sequences are available, with $B = \beta K$ and $\beta \ge 1$

spatially to suppress both parts of the inter-cell and intra-cell interference.
To evaluate the performance, a large-scale approximation of the downlink SINR
for the proposed multi-cell MMSE precoder is derived and the approximation is
tight in the large-system limit. Power control for the pilot and payload,
imperfect channel estimation and arbitrary pilot allocation are accounted for
in our precoder. Numerical results show that the proposed multi-cell MMSE
precoder achieves a significant sum spectral efficiency gain over the classical
single-cell MMSE precoder and the gain increases as $K$ or $\beta$ grows.
Compared with the recent M-ZF precoder, whose performance degrades drastically
for a large $K$, our M-MMSE can always guarantee a high and stable performance.
Moreover, the large-scale approximation is easy to compute and shown to be
accurate even for small system dimensions.

the lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer SnSe is instead higher than that
of bulk SnSe, leading to a depressed thermoelectric figure of merit compared

programming language) that handles private data to be translated into secure
distributed implementation of the corresponding functionality. The resulting
program is then guaranteed to provably protect private data using secure
multi-party computation techniques. The goals of such compilers are generality,
usability, and efficiency, but the complete set of features of a modern
programming language has not been supported to date by the existing compilers.
In particular, recent compilers PICCO and the two-party ANSI C compiler strive
to translate any C program into its secure multi-party implementation, but
currently lack support for pointers and dynamic memory allocation, which are
important components of many C programs. In this work, we mitigate the
limitation and add support for pointers to private data and consequently
dynamic memory allocation to the PICCO compiler, enabling it to handle a more
diverse set of programs over private data. Because doing so opens up a new
design space, we investigate the use of pointers to private data (with known as
well as private locations stored in them) in programs and report our findings.
Besides dynamic memory allocation, we examine other important topics associated
with common pointer use such as reference by pointer/address, casting, and
building various data structures in the context of secure multi-party
computation. This results in enabling the compiler to automatically translate a
user program that uses pointers to private data into its distributed
implementation that provably protects private data throughout the computation.
We empirically evaluate the constructions and report on performance of
representative programs.

over a vocabulary, SWMH topics are ordered subsets of such vocabulary.
Interestingly, the topics mined by SWMH underlie themes from the corpus at
different levels of granularity. We extensively evaluate the meaningfulness of
the mined topics both qualitatively and quantitatively on the NIPS (1.7 K
documents), 20 Newsgroups (20 K), Reuters (800 K) and Wikipedia (4 M) corpora.
Additionally, we compare the quality of SWMH with Online LDA topics for

avoided at the primary system. In this regard, different paradigms have been
conceptualized in the existing literature. Of these, Interweave Systems (ISs)
that employ spectrum sensing have been widely investigated. Baseline models
investigated in the literature characterize the performance of IS in terms of a
sensing-throughput tradeoff, however, this characterization assumes the
knowledge of the involved channels at the secondary transmitter, which is
unavailable in practice. Motivated by this fact, we establish a novel approach
that incorporates channel estimation in the system model, and consequently
investigate the impact of imperfect channel estimation on the performance of
the IS. More particularly, the variation induced in the detection probability
affects the detector's performance at the secondary transmitter, which may
result in severe interference at the primary users. In this view, we propose to
employ average and outage constraints on the detection probability, in order to
capture the performance of the IS. Our analysis reveals that with an
appropriate choice of the estimation time determined by the proposed model, the
degradation in performance of the IS can be effectively controlled, and
subsequently the achievable secondary throughput can be significantly enhanced.

figure of merit of SL TEM in the temperature range of 300-500K is drastically
increased with increasing level of openness of FS. However, due to the presence
of lattice component of thermal conductivity the figure of merit of SL TEM is
rather responsive to the distance between the layers and drastically drops with
its increase. Besides, for the same material, coefficient of performance of a
refrigerator in the framework of its simplest model was calculated. It was
established that if material band spectrum is described by the Fivaz model, the
coefficient of performance is drastically increased with increasing the level
of openness of FS and in case of transient FS it reaches 1.9 between the
temperatures of 300 and 230K. However, as the distance between the layers of SL

methods of search for promising SL TEM with the use of quantizing magnetic

the photometric cross calibration between the instruments at two overlapping

been processed in the Herschel Interactive Processing Environment (Version 12)
and the HFI data are from the 2015 Public Data Release 2. For our study we used
15 large fields observed with SPIRE, which cover a total of about 120 deg^2. We
have selected these fields carefully to provide high signal-to-noise ratio,
avoid residual systematics in the SPIRE maps, and span a wide range of surface
brightness. The HFI maps are bandpass-corrected to match the emission observed
by the SPIRE bandpasses. The SPIRE maps are convolved to match the HFI beam and
put on a common pixel grid. We measure the cross-calibration relative gain
between the instruments using two methods in each field, pixel-to-pixel
correlation and angular power spectrum measurements. The SPIRE / HFI relative
gains are 1.047 ($\pm$ 0.0069) and 1.003 ($\pm$ 0.0080) at 545 and 857 GHz,
respectively, indicating very good agreement between the instruments. These
relative gains deviate from unity by much less than the uncertainty of the
absolute extended emission calibration, which is about 6.4% and 9.5% for HFI

and 5.5% for HFI and SPIRE if the uncertainty from models of the common
calibrator can be discounted. Of the 5.5% uncertainty for SPIRE, 4% arises from
the uncertainty of the effective beam solid angle, which impacts the adopted
SPIRE point source to extended source unit conversion factor (Abridged)

dependence of its binding energy. In particular, the parameter-free
leading-order calculation shows that the $X$-pole disappears for unphysical
large pion masses. On the other hand, without contradicting the naive
dimensional analysis, the higher-order pion-mass-dependent contact interaction
can change the slope of the binding energy at the physical point yielding the
opposite scenario of a stronger bound $X$ at pion masses larger than its
physical value. An important role of the pion dynamics and of the 3-body
$D\bar{D}\pi$ effects for chiral extrapolations of the $X$-pole is emphasised.

eruption in triggering the flare, which consists of two different set of
ribbons: parallel ribbons as well as a large-scale quasi-circular ribbon.
Several observational evidence and nonlinear force-free field extrapolation
results show the existence of a large-scale fan-spine type magnetic
configuration with a sigmoid lying under a section of the fan dome. The event
can be explained with the following two phases. During the pre-flare phase, we
observed the formation and appearance of sigmoid via tether-cutting
reconnection between the two sets of sheared fields under the fan dome. The
second, main flare phase, features the eruption of the sigmoid, the subsequent
flare with parallel ribbons, and a quasi-circular ribbon. We propose the
following multi-stage successive reconnections scenario for the main flare.
First, tether-cutting reconnection is responsible for the formation and the
eruption of the sigmoid structure. Second, the reconnection occurred in the
wake of the erupting sigmoid produces the parallel flare ribbons on the both
sides of the circular polarity inversion line. Third, the null-type
reconnection higher in the corona, possibly triggered by the erupting sigmoid,
leads to the formation of a large quasi-circular ribbon. For the first time we
suggest a mechanism for this type of flare consisting of a double set of
ribbons triggered by an erupting sigmoid in a large scale fan-spine type
magnetic configuration.

days, and attributed this periodic modulation to M82 X-1. However, this
modulation is not necessarily from M82 X-1 because RXTE/PCA has a very poor
spatial resolution of ~1 degree. In this work, we analyzed 1000 days of
monitoring data of M82 X-1 from the Swift/X-ray telescope (XRT), which has a
much better spatial resolution than RXTE/PCA. The periodicity distribution map
of M82 reveals that the 62-day periodicity is most likely not from M82 X-1, but
from the summed contributions of several periodic X-ray sources 4 arcsec
southeast of M82 X-1. However, Swift/XRT is not able to resolve those periodic
sources and locate the precise origin of the periodicity of M82. Thus, more
long-term observations with higher spatial resolution are required.

Focusing on the longitudinal aspects of scientific collaboration, we analyzed
473 collaboration profiles using an ego-centric perspective which accounts for
researcher-specific characteristics and provides insight into a range of
topics, from career achievement and sustainability to team dynamics and
efficiency. From more than 166,000 collaboration records, we quantify the
frequency distributions of collaboration duration and tie-strength, showing
that collaboration networks are dominated by weak ties characterized by high
turnover rates. We use analytic extreme-value thresholds to identify a new
class of indispensable `super ties', the strongest of which commonly exhibit
>50% publication overlap with the central scientist. The prevalence of super
ties suggests that they arise from career strategies based upon cost, risk, and
reward sharing and complementary skill matching. We then use a combination of
descriptive and panel regression methods to compare the subset of publications
coauthored with a super tie to the subset without one, controlling for
pertinent features such as career age, prestige, team size, and prior group
experience. We find that super ties contribute to above-average productivity

partnerships - the analog of life partners - as a major factor in science
career development.

known that there exists a family of standing waves, symmetric with respect to
the exchange of edges, that can be parametrized by the mass (or $L^2$-norm) of
its elements. Furthermore, if the mass is small enough, then the corresponding
symmetric standing wave is a ground state and, consequently, it is orbitally

system has no ground state. Here we prove that orbital stability holds for
every value of the mass, even if the corresponding symmetric standing wave is
not a ground state, since it is anyway a {\em local} minimizer of the energy
among functions with the same mass. The proof is based on a new technique that

presumably corresponding to a mean gravitational fragmentation scale, and 2) a
characteristic power-law slope, very similar to the Salpeter slope of the
stellar initial mass function (IMF) at the high-mass end. While recent Herschel
observations have shown that the peak of the prestellar CMF is close to the
thermal Jeans mass in marginally supercritical filaments, the origin of the
power-law tail of the CMF/IMF at the high-mass end is less clear. Inutsuka
(2001) proposed a theoretical scenario in which the origin of the power-law

density perturbations seeded along the long axis of filaments by interstellar
turbulence. Here, we report the statistical properties of the line-mass
fluctuations of filaments in nearby molecular clouds observed with Herschel
using a 1-D power spectrum analysis. The observed filament power spectra were
fitted by a power-law function $(P_{true}(s) \propto s^{\alpha})$ after
removing the effect of beam convolution at small scales. A Gaussian-like
distribution of power-spectrum slopes was found centered at -1.6, close to that
of the one-dimensional velocity power spectrum generated by subsonic
Kolomogorov turbulence (-1.67). An empirical correlation, $P^{0.5}(s_0) \propto
<N_{\rm H_2}>^{1.4 \pm 0.1} $, was also found between the amplitude of each
filament power spectrum $P(s_0)$ and the mean column density along the filament
$<N_{\rm H_2}>$. Finally, the dispersion of line-mass fluctuations along each
filament $\sigma_{\rm M_{line}}$ was found to scale with the physical length
$L$ of the filament, roughly as $\sigma_{M_{line}} \propto L^{0.7}$. Overall,
our results are consistent with the suggestion that the bulk of the CMF/IMF
results from the gravitational fragmentation of filaments.

of imaging electron tracks, a feature that enhances the separation between
signal events (the two electrons emitted in the 0nbb decay of 136Xe) and
background events, arising chiefly from single electrons of kinetic energy
compatible with the end-point of the 0nbb decay (Qbb ). Applying an external
magnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for
operating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to
produce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the
sign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these
tracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events
containing two electrons producing a track with two different directions of
curvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that
should spiral in a single direction. Due to electron multiple scattering, this
strategy is not perfectly efficient on an event-by-event basis, but a
statistical estimator can be constructed which can be used to reject background
events by one order of magnitude at a moderate cost (approx. 30%) in signal
efficiency. Combining this estimator with the excellent energy resolution and
topological signature identification characteristic of the HPXe TPC, it is
possible to reach a background rate of less than one count per ton-year of
exposure. Such a low background rate is an essential feature of the next
generation of 0nbb experiments, aiming to fully explore the inverse hierarchy

triangularization of the channel matrices. We find that the same technique can
be used to re-derive capacity expressions for the MIMO wiretap channel in a way
that is simple and closely connected to a transmission scheme. This technique
allows to extend the previously proven strong security for scalar Gaussian
channels to the MIMO case. We further consider the problem of transmitting
confidential messages over a two-user broadcast MIMO channel. For that problem,
we find that derivation of both the capacity and a transmission scheme is a
direct corollary of the proposed analysis for the MIMO wiretap channel.

simple distributed protocol by pinning control technique is designed, whose
validity is rigorously proved, and some sufficient criteria for fixed-time

have been proposed and studied recently. In this paper we analyze and test a
fractional-order derivative based total $\alpha$-order variation model, which
can outperform the currently popular high order regularization models. There
exist several previous works using total $\alpha$-order variations for image
restoration; however first no analysis is done yet and second all tested
formulations, differing from each other, utilize the zero Dirichlet boundary
conditions which are not realistic (while non-zero boundary conditions violate
definitions of fractional-order derivatives). This paper first reviews some
results of fractional-order derivatives and then analyzes the theoretical
properties of the proposed total $\alpha$-order variational model rigorously.
It then develops four algorithms for solving the variational problem, one based
on the variational Split-Bregman idea and three based on direct solution of the
discretise-optimization problem. Numerical experiments show that, in terms of
restoration quality and solution efficiency, the proposed model can produce
highly competitive results, for smooth images, to two established high order

manifests as cell-to-cell variability or noise in protein copy numbers. Since
proteins half-lives can be comparable to the cell-cycle length, randomness in
cell-division times generates additional intercellular variability in protein
levels. Moreover, as many mRNA/protein species are expressed at low-copy
numbers, errors incurred in partitioning of molecules between the mother and
daughter cells are significant. We derive analytical formulas for the total
noise in protein levels for a general class of cell-division time and
partitioning error distributions. Using a novel hybrid approach the total noise
is decomposed into components arising from i) stochastic expression; ii)
partitioning errors at the time of cell-division and iii) random cell-division
events. These formulas reveal that random cell-division times not only generate
additional extrinsic noise but also critically affect the mean protein copy
numbers and intrinsic noise components. Counter intuitively, in some parameter
regimes noise in protein levels can decrease as cell-division times become more
stochastic. Computations are extended to consider genome duplication, where the
gene dosage is increased by two-fold at a random point in the cell-cycle. We
systematically investigate how the timing of genome duplication influences
different protein noise components. Intriguingly, results show that noise
contribution from stochastic expression is minimized at an optimal genome
duplication time. Our theoretical results motivate new experimental methods for
decomposing protein noise levels from single-cell expression data.
Characterizing the contributions of individual noise mechanisms will lead to

  4","33 pages",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We explore incompressible homogeneous isotropic turbulence within the
(fourth-order model) formulation of optimal control and optimization, in
contrast to the classical works of Proudman and Reid (1954) and Tatsumi (1957),
with the intention to fix specially their defect of negative energy spectrum
values being developed and to examine generally the conventional closure
schemes. The isotropic forms for the general and spatially degenerated fourth
order correlations of fluctuating velocity are obtained and the corresponding
primary dynamical equations are derived. The degenerated fourth order
correlation contains four scalar functions $D_i$, $i=1,2,3,4$, whose
determination is the focus of closure. We discuss the constraints of equality
for these functions as required by the self-consistency of the definition of
the degenerated. Furthermore, we develop the constraints of inequality for the
scalar functions based on the application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the
non-negativity of the variance of products, and the non-negativity of the
turbulent energy spectrum. We intend to indicate the difficulty for a
conventional scheme to satisfy all these constraints. As an alternative, we
employ the turbulent energy per unit volume as the objective function to be
maximized, under the constraints and the dynamical equations, with the four
scalar functions as the control variables, which is a second-order cone
programming problem. We then treat the asymptotic state solutions at large time
and focus especially on the sub-model where the third order correlation is
taken as the control variable, considering the computing resources available.

overcome the instantaneous gelation of electrospun collagen scaffolds in
biological environments. Scaffolds based on blends of type I collagen and PDLLA
were investigated for material stability in cell culture conditions (37
{\deg}C; 5% CO2) in which post-electrospinning glutaraldehyde crosslinking was
also applied. The resulting wet-stable webs were cultured with bone marrow
stromal cells (HBMSC) for five weeks. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), Fourier transform infra-red
spectroscopy (FTIR) and biochemical assays were used to characterise the
scaffolds and the consequent cell-scaffold constructs. To investigate any
electrospinning-induced denaturation of collagen, identical PDLLA/collagen and
PDLLA/gelatine blends were electrospun and their potential to promote
osteogenic differentiation investigated. PDLLA/collagen blends with w/w ratios
of 40/60, 60/40 and 80/20 resulted in satisfactory wet stabilities in a humid
environment, although chemical crosslinking was essential to ensure long term
material cell culture. Scaffolds of PDLLA/collagen at a 60:40 weight ratio
provided the greatest stability over a five-week culture period. The
PDLLA/collagen scaffolds promoted greater cell proliferation and osteogenic
differentiation compared to HMBSCs seeded on the corresponding PDLLA/gelatine
scaffolds, suggesting that any electrospinning-induced collagen denaturation
did not affect material biofunctionality within 5 weeks in vitro.

generalized $\alpha\beta$-$H((.,.),(.,.))$-mixed accretive mappings in Banach
spaces. We extend the concept of proximal-point mappings associated with
generalized $m$-accretive mappings to the generalized
$\alpha\beta$-$H((.,.),(.,.))$-mixed accretive mappings and prove that the
proximal-point mapping associated with generalized
$\alpha\beta$-$H((.,.),(.,.))$-mixed accretive mapping is single-valued and
Lipschitz continuous. Some examples are given to justify the definition of
generalized $\alpha\beta$-$H((.,.),(.,.))$-mixed accretive mappings. Further,
by using the proximal mapping technique, an iterative algorithm for solving a
class of variational inclusions is constructed in real $q$-uniformly smooth
Banach spaces. Under some suitable conditions, we prove the convergence of
iterative sequence generated by the algorithm.

interacting and juxtaposed, therefore the social sciences need to rely on the
studies of physical sciences to analyze this complexity in the relationships.
According to this point of view we rely on the geometrical model of the
M\""obius strip used in the electromagnetism which analyzes the moves of the
electrons that produce energy. We use a similar model in a Corporate Social
Responsibility context to devise a new cost function in order to take into
account of three positive crossed effects on the efficiency: i)cooperation
among stakeholders in the same sector, ii)cooperation among similar
stakeholders in different sectors and iii)the stakeholders' loyalty towards the
company. By applying this new cost function to a firm's decisional problem we
find that investing in Corporate Social Responsibility activities is ever
convenient depending on the number of sectors, the stakeholders' sensitivity to
these investments and the decay rate to alienation. Our work suggests a new
method of analysis which should be developed not only at a theoretical but also
at an empirical level.
