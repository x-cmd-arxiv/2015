formulation, are presented and an explicit form of a related functional,
involving only currents in a spatial domain, is derived. The new formulation
leads to deeper insight into the modal behavior of radiating structures as
demonstrated by a detailed analysis of three canonical structures: a dipole, an
array of two dipoles and a loop, cylinder and a sphere. It is demonstrated that
knowledge of the analytical functional can be utilized to solve important
problems related to the theory of characteristic modes decomposition such as
the resonance of inductive modes or the benchmarking of method of moments code.

Computer Science Logic (CSL 2015).
  Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer science.
They are used to justify (co)recursive definitions and associated reasoning
techniques. The construction and properties of fixed points have been
investigated in many different settings such as: design and implementation of
programming languages, logics, verification, databases. The aim of this
workshop is to provide a forum for researchers to present their results to
those members of the computer science and logic communities who study or apply
the theory of fixed points.
  Each of the 11 contributed papers of this volume were evaluated by three or
four reviewers. Some of the papers were re-reviewed after revision.
  Additionally, this volume contains the abstracts of the FICS 2015 invited
talks given by Bartek Klin and James Worrell.

primarily rely on measurements of stellar mass and star formation rate of
distant galaxies. In this paper, we present stellar masses and star formation
rates of six high-redshift ($2.8\leq z \leq 5.7$) dusty, star-forming galaxies
(DSFGs) that are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. These
sources were first discovered by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) at millimeter
wavelengths and all have spectroscopic redshifts and robust lens models derived
from ALMA observations. We have conducted follow-up observations, obtaining
multi-wavelength imaging data, using {\it HST}, {\it Spitzer}, {\it Herschel}
and the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX). We use the high-resolution {\it
HST}/WFC3 images to disentangle the background source from the foreground lens
in {\it Spitzer}/IRAC data. The detections and upper limits provide important
constraints on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for these DSFGs,
yielding stellar masses, IR luminosities, and star formation rates (SFRs). The
SED fits of six SPT sources show that the intrinsic stellar masses span a range
more than one order of magnitude with a median value $\sim$ 5 $\times
10^{10}M_{\Sun}$. The intrinsic IR luminosities range from 4$\times
10^{12}L_{\Sun}$ to 4$\times 10^{13}L_{\Sun}$. They all have prodigious
intrinsic star formation rates of 510 to 4800 $M_{\Sun} {\rm yr}^{-1}$.
Compared to the star-forming main sequence (MS), these six DSFGs have specific
SFRs that all lie above the MS, including two galaxies that are a factor of 10
higher than the MS. Our results suggest that we are witnessing the ongoing
strong starburst events which may be driven by major mergers.

B. In total, we collected seven spectral epochs of J0230 that demonstrate
emergent and rapidly (~10 days in the rest-frame) varying broad absorption. We
investigate two possible scenarios that could cause these rapid changes: bulk
motion and ionization variability. Given our multi-epoch data, we were able to
rule out some simple models of bulk motion, but have proposed two more
realistic models to explain the variability of both troughs. Trough A is likely
an augmented `crossing disk' scenario with the absorber moving at 10,000 < v

changes in covalent bonding due to linear alchemical interpolations among
molecules. We have investigated $\sigma$ bonding to hydrogen, as well as
$\sigma$ and $\pi$ bonding between main-group elements, occurring in small sets
of iso-valence-electronic molecular species with elements drawn from second to
fourth rows in the $p$-block of the periodic table. Numerical evidence suggests
that first order estimates of covalent bonding potentials can achieve chemical
accuracy if (i) the alchemical interpolation is vertical (fixed geometry), (ii)
involves molecules containing elements in the third and fourth row of the
periodic table, and (iii) a reference geometry is optimized. In this case,
changes in the bonding potential become near-linear in coupling parameter,
resulting in analytical predictions with very high accuracy ($\sim$1 kcal/mol).
Second order estimates deteriorate the prediction. If initial and final
molecules differ not only in composition but also in geometry, all estimates
become substantially worse, with second order being slightly more accurate than
first order. The independent particle approximation to the second order
perturbation performs poorly when compared to the coupled perturbed or finite
difference approach. Taylor series expansions up to fourth order of the

emerged as important tools for sharing ideas without the fear of judgment. Such
anonymous platforms are also important in nations under authoritarian rule,
where freedom of expression and the personal safety of message authors may
depend on anonymity. Whether for fear of judgment or retribution, it is
sometimes crucial to hide the identities of users who post sensitive messages.
In this paper, we consider a global adversary who wishes to identify the author
of a message; it observes either a snapshot of the spread of a message at a
certain time, sampled timestamp metadata, or both. Recent advances in rumor
source detection show that existing messaging protocols are vulnerable against
such an adversary. We introduce a novel messaging protocol, which we call
adaptive diffusion, and show that under the snapshot adversarial model,
adaptive diffusion spreads content fast and achieves perfect obfuscation of the
source when the underlying contact network is an infinite regular tree. That
is, all users with the message are nearly equally likely to have been the
origin of the message. When the contact network is an irregular tree, we
characterize the probability of maximum likelihood detection by proving a
concentration result over Galton-Watson trees. Experiments on a sampled
Facebook network demonstrate that adaptive diffusion effectively hides the
location of the source even when the graph is finite, irregular and has cycles.

interior into the solar atmosphere. We investigate whether the length of the
buoyant part of the flux tube (i.e. {\lambda}) affects the emergence of the
field and the dynamics of the evolving magnetic flux system. Methods. We
perform three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent, resistive, compressible MHD
simulations using the Lare3D code. Results. We find that there are considerable
differences in the dynamics of the emergence of a magnetic flux tube when
{\lambda} is varied. In the solar interior, for larger values of {\lambda}, the
rising magnetic field emerges faster and expands more due to its lower magnetic
tension. As a result, its field strength decreases and its emergence above the
photosphere occurs later than in the smaller {\lambda} case. However, in both
cases, the emerging field at the photosphere becomes unstable in two places,
forming two magnetic bipoles that interact dynamically during the evolution of
the system. Most of the dynamic phenomena occur at the current layer, which is
formed at the interface between the interacting bipoles. We find the formation
and ejection of plasmoids, the onset of successive jets from the interface, and
the impulsive heating of the plasma in the solar atmosphere. We discuss the
triggering mechanism of the jets and the atmospheric response to the emergence
of magnetic flux in the two cases.

is the model-independent determination of the absolute Higgs couplings to

Higgsstrahlung cross section, using the recoil mass technique, sets the
absolute scale for all Higgs coupling measurements. Previous studies have
considered e+e- ->ZH with Z->l+l-, where l = electron or muon. In this paper it
is shown for the first time that a near model-independent recoil mass technique
can be extended to the hadronic decays of the Z boson. Because the branching
ratio for Z->qq is approximately ten times greater than for Z->l+l-, this
method is statistically more powerful than using the leptonic decays. For an
integrated luminosity of 500 fb-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 350 GeV at
CLIC, the e+e-->HZ cross section can be measured to 1.8 % using the hadronic
recoil mass technique. A similar precision is found for the ILC operating at

discussed, arguing for the initial operation of a future linear collider at

of these QDs. In the shell-filling regime, the $8\times$ degeneracy of the
electronic levels is lifted by the Coulomb interactions and allows the
observation of phonon sub-bands that result from the emission of optical
phonons. At low bias, a gap is observed in the ETS that cannot be closed with
the gate voltage, which is a distinguishing feature of the Franck-Condon (FC)
blockade. From the data, a Huang-Rhys factor in the range $S\sim 1.7 - 2.5$ is
obtained. Finally, in the shell tunneling regime, the optical phonons appear in
the inelastic ETS $d^2I/dV^2$.

using a dataset summarizing the precise location of millions of amenities. We
use this dataset to build the network of co-location of amenities, or Amenity

and then using the identified neighborhoods to map the probability that two
amenities will be co-located in one of them. Finally, we use the Amenity Space
to build a recommender system that identifies the amenities that are missing in
a neighborhood given its current pattern of specialization. This opens the door
for the construction of amenity recommendation algorithms that can be used to
evaluate neighborhoods and inform their improvement and development.

for missing data, which is expressed by the Fisher information matrices of
complete data and incomplete data. We prove that our criterion is an
asymptotically unbiased estimator of complete-data divergence, namely, the
expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the
estimated distribution for complete data, whereas AIC is that for the
incomplete data. Information criteria PDIO (Shimodaira 1994) and AICcd
(Cavanaugh and Shumway 1998) have been previously proposed to estimate
complete-data divergence, and they have the same penalty term. The additional
penalty term of our criterion for missing data turns out to be only half the
value of that in PDIO and AICcd. The difference in the penalty term is
attributed to the fact that our criterion is derived under a weaker assumption.
A simulation study with the weaker assumption shows that our criterion is
unbiased while the other two criteria are biased. In addition, we review the
geometrical view of alternating minimizations of the EM algorithm. This
geometrical view plays an important role in deriving our new criterion.

systems. In the context of complex networks, bilinear systems capture scenarios
where an actuator not only can affect the state of a node but also
interconnections among nodes. Under the assumption that the input's infinity
norm is bounded by some function of the network dynamic matrices, we derive a
Gramian-based lower bound on the minimum input energy required to steer the
state from the origin to any reachable target state. This result motivates our
study of various objects associated to the reachability Gramian to quantify the
ease of controllability of the bilinear network: the minimum eigenvalue
(worst-case minimum input energy to reach a state), the trace (average minimum
input energy to reach a state), and its determinant (volume of the ellipsoid
containing the reachable states using control inputs with no more than unit
energy). We establish an increasing returns property of the reachability
Gramian as a function of the actuators, which in turn allows us to derive a
general lower bound on the reachability metrics in terms of the aggregate
contribution of the individual actuators. We conclude by examining the effect
on the worst-case minimum input energy of the addition of bilinear inputs to
difficult-to-control linear symmetric networks. We show that the bilinear
networks resulting from the addition of either inputs at a finite number of
interconnections or at all self loops with weight vanishing with the network

distribution. The peak of the atomic gas PDF in and around Perseus lies at the
HI-H2 transition column density for this cloud, past which the N(H2) PDF takes
on a powerlaw form. We find that the PDF of the atomic gas is narrow and at
column densities larger than the HI-H2 transition the HI rapidly depletes,
suggesting that the HI PDF may be used to find the HI-H2 transition column
density. We also calculate the sonic Mach number of the atomic gas by using HI
absorption line data, which yields a median value of Ms=4.0 for the CNM, while
the HI emission PDF, which traces both the WNM and CNM, has a width more
consistent with transonic turbulence.

$s$ orbitals are decoupled from itinerant $p$ bands and are driven into a Mott
insulator due to strong Hubbard interaction. Raman laser beams are then applied
to induce tunnelings between $s$ and $p$ orbitals, and generate a staggered
flux simultaneously. Due to the strong Hubbard interaction of $s$ orbital
states, we predict the existence of a critical Raman laser-assisted coupling,
beyond which the Kondo screening is achieved and then a fully gapped Chern
Kondo phase emerges, with the topology characterized by integer Chern numbers.
Being a strongly correlated topological state, the Chern Kondo phase is
different from the single-particle quantum anomalous Hall state, and can be
identified by measuring the band topology and double occupancy of $s$ orbitals.
The experimental realization and detection of the predicted Chern Kondo

Being the largest IACT worldwide, CT5 allows to lower the energy threshold of
H.E.S.S., making the array sensitive at energies where space-based detectors
run out of statistics. Events can be analysed either monoscopically (i.e. using
only information of CT5) or stereoscopically (requiring at least two triggered

reconstruction and analysis framework is indispensable. This is particularly
important for H.E.S.S. since it is now the first IACT array that consists of
different telescope types. An advanced reconstruction method is based on a
semi-analytical model of electromagnetic particle showers in the atmosphere
(model analysis). The properties of the primary particle are reconstructed by
comparing the image recorded by each triggered telescope with the Cherenkov
emission from the shower model using a log-likelihood maximisation. Due to its

evolution of globular clusters (GCs) in the context of galaxy formation and
evolution. It is discussed that an end-to-end model for GC formation and
evolution should capture four different phases: (1) star and cluster formation
in the high-pressure interstellar medium of high-redshift galaxies, (2) cluster
disruption by tidal shocks in the gas-rich host galaxy disc, (3) cluster
migration into the galaxy halo, and (4) the final evaporation-dominated
evolution of GCs until the present day. Previous models have mainly focussed on
phase 4. We present and discuss a simple model that includes each of these four
steps - its key difference with respect to previous work is the simultaneous
addition of the high-redshift formation and early evolution of young GCs, as
well as their migration into galaxy haloes. The new model provides an excellent
match to the observed GC mass spectrum and specific frequency, as well as the
relations of GCs to the host dark matter halo mass and supermassive black hole
mass. These results show (1) that the properties of present-day GCs are
reproduced by assuming that they are the natural outcome of regular
high-redshift star formation (i.e. they form according to same physical
processes that govern massive cluster formation in the local Universe), and (2)
that models only including GC evaporation strongly underestimate their
integrated mass loss over a Hubble time.

of a 0+1d system undergoing boost-invariant Bjorken expansion and subject to
the relaxation-time approximation collisional kernel. Using this setup, we
compare results obtained using the new quasiparticle equation of state method

the late stages of a gas-rich major merger, detailing the dynamics of two

phase. During the merger gas clumps with masses of a fraction of the black hole
mass form because of fragmentation. Such high-density gas is very effective in
forming stars, and the most massive clumps can substantially perturb the black
hole orbits. After $\sim 10$ Myr from the start of the merger a gravitationally
bound black hole binary forms at a separation of a few parsecs, and soon after,
the separation falls below our resolution limit of $0.39$ pc. At the time of
binary formation the original discs are almost completely disrupted because of
SNa feedback, while on pc scales the residual gas settles in a circumbinary
disc with mass $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$. We also test that binary dynamics is robust
against the details of the SNa feedback employed in the simulations, while gas

quartic self-interactions to the scalar field theory, described by the

$M_{\rm ADM}^{\rm max}\sim \sqrt{\lambda}M_{Pl}^3/\mu^2$. Thus, for mini-BSs,

self-interacting BSs can reach such values for bosonic particles with Standard
Model range masses. We investigate how these same self-interactions affect Kerr
black holes with scalar hair (KBHsSH) [1], which can be regarded as (spinning)
BSs in stationary equilibrium with a central horizon. Remarkably, whereas the
ADM mass scales in the same way as for BSs, the \textit{horizon mass} $M_H$

maximized at the ""Hod point"", corresponding to the extremal Kerr black hole

model, whereas in a second approach, data selection was performed by requiring
that the observations follow theoretical expectations. We show here that, due
to inherent limitations in the data, the theoretically expected trends are not
discernible in the majority of X-ray bursts even if they are present.
Therefore, the proposed theoretical selection criteria are not practical with
the current data for distinguishing clean data sets from outliers. Furthermore,
when the data limitations are not taken into account, the theoretically
motivated approach selects a small subset of bursts with properties that are in
fact inconsistent with the underlying assumptions of the method. We conclude
that the data-driven selection methods do not suffer from the limitations of
this theoretically motivated one.

that underlies strong-interaction dynamics. The series begins with a primer on
continuum QCD, which introduces some of the basic ideas necessary in order to
understand the use of Schwinger functions as a nonperturbative tool in hadron
physics. It continues with a discussion of confinement and dynamical symmetry
breaking (DCSB) in the Standard Model, and the impact of these phenomena on our
understanding of condensates, the parton structure of hadrons, and the pion
electromagnetic form factor. The final lecture treats the problem of grand
unification; namely, the contemporary use of Schwinger functions as a
symmetry-preserving tool for the unified explanation and prediction of the
properties of both mesons and baryons. It reveals that DCSB drives the
formation of diquark clusters in baryons and sketches a picture of baryons as
bound-states with Borromean character. Planned experiments are capable of
validating the perspectives outlined in these lectures.

spin-$\frac12$ per unit cell, the symmetry fractionalization of visons is
completely fixed. On the other hand, visons can have different classes of

significant gamma-ray excess surrounding the center of the Milky Way (GC). One
possible interpretation of this excess invokes gamma-ray emission from an
undiscovered population of either young or recycled pulsars densely clustered
throughout the inner kiloparsec of the Milky Way. While these systems, by
construction, have individual fluxes that lie below the point source
sensitivity of the Fermi-LAT, they may already be observed in multiwavelength
observations. Notably the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) catalog
of radio pulsars includes 270 sources observed in the inner 10 degrees around
the GC. We calculate the gamma-ray emission observed from these 270 sources and
obtain three key results: (1) point source searches in the GC region produce a
plethora of highly significant gamma-ray ""hotspots"", compared to searches far
from the Galactic plane, (2) there is no statistical correlation between the
positions of these gamma-ray hotspots and the locations of ATNF pulsars, and
(3) the spectrum of the most statistically significant gamma-ray hotspots is
substantially softer than the spectrum of the GC gamma-ray excess. These
results place strong constraints on models where young pulsars produce the
majority of the gamma-ray excess, and disfavor some models where millisecond
pulsars produce the gamma-ray excess.

as 3 kpc from M82's midplane. Kinematic signatures of the outflow are visible
in both the CO and HI emission: both tracers show a minor axis velocity
gradient and together they show double peaked profiles, consistent with a hot
outflow bounded by a cone made of a mix of atomic and molecular gas. Combining
our CO and HI data with observations of the dust continuum, we study the
changing properties of the cold outflow as it leaves the disk. While H_2
dominates the ISM near the disk, the dominant phase of the cool medium changes
as it leaves the galaxy and becomes mostly atomic after about a kpc. Several
arguments suggest that regardless of phase, the mass in the cold outflow does
not make it far from the disk; the mass flux through surfaces above the disk
appears to decline with a projected scale length of ~ 1-2 kpc. The cool
material must also end up distributed over a much wider angle than the hot
outflow based on the nearly circular isophotes of dust and CO at low intensity
and the declining rotation velocities as a function of height from the plane.
The minor axis of M82 appears so striking at many wavelengths because the
interface between the hot wind cavity and the cool gas produces Halpha, hot
dust, PAH emission, and scattered UV light. We also show the level at which a
face-on version of M82 would be detectable as an outflow based on unresolved
spectroscopy. Finally, we consider multiple constraints on the CO-to-H$_2$

pairing of electrons with opposite Fermi momenta, forming Cooper pairs whose
net momentum is zero [1]. Several recent studies have focused on structures
where such conventional $s$-wave superconductors are coupled to systems with an
unusual configuration of electronic spin and momentum at the Fermi surface.
Under these conditions, the nature of the paired state can be modified and the
system may even undergo a topological phase transition [2, 3]. Here we present
measurements and theoretical calculations of several HgTe quantum wells coupled
to either aluminum or niobium superconductors and subject to a magnetic field
in the plane of the quantum well. By studying the oscillatory response of
Josephson interference to the magnitude of the in-plane magnetic field, we find
that the induced pairing within the quantum well is spatially varying. Cooper
pairs acquire a tunable momentum that grows with magnetic field strength,
directly reflecting the response of the spin-dependent Fermi surfaces to the
in-plane magnetic field. In addition, in the regime of high electron density,
nodes in the induced superconductivity evolve with the electron density in
agreement with our model based on the Hamiltonian of Bernevig, Hughes, and
Zhang [4]. This agreement allows us to quantitatively extract the value of
$\tilde{g}/v_{F}$, where $\tilde{g}$ is the effective g-factor and $v_{F}$ is
the Fermi velocity. However, at low density our measurements do not agree with

momentum might be shed from young stellar systems, thus yielding slowly
rotating young stars. Assuming that planets promptly form in circumstellar
disks and rapidly migrate close to the central star, we investigate how the
tidal and magnetic interactions between the protostar, its close-in planet(s),

the central object. We find that neither the tidal torque nor the variety of
magnetic torques acting between the star and the embedded planet are able to
counteract the spin up torques due to accretion and contraction. Indeed, the
former are orders of magnitude weaker than the latter beyond the corotation
radius and are thus unable to prevent the young star from spinning up. We
conclude that star-planet interaction in the early phases of stellar evolution
does not appear as a viable alternative to magnetic star-disk coupling to
understand the origin of the low angular momentum content of young stars.

tight both in the weak and strong interference regimes. In light of this
capacity result, the capacity region of the degraded Gaussian interference

varies from 0 to 100% of the interfering signal, depending on the relative

patterns of interdependency lead to structure at multiple scales of
organization. Evolution excels at producing such complex structures. In turn,
the existence of these complex interrelationships within a biological system
affects the evolutionary dynamics of that system. I present a mathematical
formalism for multiscale structure, grounded in information theory, which makes
these intuitions quantitative, and I show how dynamics defined in terms of
population genetics or evolutionary game theory can lead to multiscale
organization. For complex systems, ""more is different,"" and I address this from
several perspectives. Spatial host--consumer models demonstrate the importance
of the structures which can arise due to dynamical pattern formation.
Evolutionary game theory reveals the novel effects which can result from

action affects only her own payoff. In this paper, I present a model in which
agents' actions directly affect the payoffs of other agents. On a discrete time
line, there is a community containing a random number of agents in each period.
Before each agent needs to take an action, the community receives a private
signal about the underlying state of the world and may observe some past
actions in previous communities. An agent's payoff is higher if her action
matches the state or if more agents take the same action as hers. I analyze two
observation structures: exogenous observation and costly strategic observation.
In both cases, coordination motives enhance social learning in the sense that
agents take the correct action with significantly higher probability when the
community size is greater than a threshold. In particular, this probability
reaches one (asymptotic learning) with unbounded private beliefs and can be
arbitrarily close to one with bounded private beliefs. I then discuss the issue
of multiple equilibria and use risk dominance as a criterion for equilibrium
selection. I find that in the selected equilibria, the community size has no
effect on learning under exogenous observation, facilitates learning under
endogenous observation and unbounded private beliefs, and either helps or
hinders learning under endogenous observation and bounded private beliefs.

Hartree-Fock plus random-phase approximation with various effective
interactions, we compare the correlations between $L$ and these four
quantities. The correlation derived from different interactions and the
correlation from a class of interactions that are identical in the symmetric
matter as well as in $S_0$ are simultaneously examined. These two types of
correlations may behave differently, as exemplified in the correlation of
$\alpha_D$ to $L$. It is found that the neutron skin thickness and
$\alpha_DS_0$ correlate well to $L$, and therefore are suitable for narrowing
down the value of $L$ via experiments. The LED emergence and upgrowth makes the
$\alpha_DS_0$-$L$ correlation strong, although these correlations are
disarranged when neutron halo appears in the ground state.

Some conventional and emerging memories are suitable for vertical integration,

demonstrate memory and logic functionality in a monolithic three-dimensional
circuit by adapting recently proposed memristor-based stateful material
implication logic. Though such logic has been already implemented with a
variety of memory devices, prohibitively large device variability in the most
prospective memristor-based circuits has limited experimental demonstrations to
simple gates and just a few cycles of operations. By developing a
low-temperature, low-variability fabrication process, and modifying the
original circuit to increase its robustness to device imperfections, we
experimentally show, for the first time, reliable multi-cycle multi-gate
material implication logic operation within a three-dimensional stack of
monolithically integrated memristors. The direct data manipulation in three
dimensions enables extremely compact and high-throughput logic-in-memory
computing and, remarkably, presents a viable solution for the Feynman grand

if presented; SImulator of GAlaxy Millimeter/submillimeter Emission (S\'IGAME)
which can predict the atomic/molecular line emission in the far-infrared regime
from galaxies. By post-processing the outputs of cosmological simulations of
galaxy formation with sub-grid physics recipes, S\'IGAME divides the
interstellar medium (ISM) into different gas phases and derives density and
temperature structure, employing locally resolved radiation and pressure
fields. This method is used to predict the strengths of CO rotational
transitions as well as the [CII] emission line in normal star-forming galaxies
at z~2. A CO ladder close to that of our own Galaxy is found, but with CO-H2
conversion factors about 3 times smaller. For a set of 7 simulated galaxies at
z~2, the relation between [CII] luminosity and SFR displays a slope
significantly steeper than that found for observed galaxies at z<0.5. A
corresponding relation on kpc-scales is established for the first time
theoretically. Finally, a separate study uncovers the number fraction of AGNs
among massive galaxies at z~2, by analyzing CHANDRA CDF-S X-ray data. It is
found that about every fifth massive galaxy, quenched or not, contains an X-ray
luminous AGN. Interestingly, an even higher fraction of low-luminosity AGNs
emerges in the X-ray undetected galaxies when performing a stacking analysis,
and preferentially in the quenched ones, lending support to the importance of
AGNs in impeding star formation during galaxy evolution.

another (e.g., for bitrate adaptation or view switching) is important for many
interactive streaming applications. Recently, stream-switching mechanisms based
on distributed source coding (DSC) have been proposed. In order to reduce the
overall transmission rate, these approaches provide a ""merge"" mechanism, where
information is sent to the decoder such that the exact same frame can be
reconstructed given that any one of a known set of side information (SI) frames
is available at the decoder (e.g., each SI frame may correspond to a different
stream from which we are switching). However, the use of bit-plane coding and
channel coding in many DSC approaches leads to complex coding and decoding. In
this paper, we propose an alternative approach for merging multiple SI frames,
using a piecewise constant (PWC) function as the merge operator. In our
approach, for each block to be reconstructed, a series of parameters of these
PWC merge functions are transmitted in order to guarantee identical
reconstruction given the known side information blocks. We consider two
different scenarios. In the first case, a target frame is first given, and then
merge parameters are chosen so that this frame can be reconstructed exactly at
the decoder. In contrast, in the second scenario, the reconstructed frame and
merge parameters are jointly optimized to meet a rate-distortion criteria.
Experiments show that for both scenarios, our proposed merge techniques can
outperform both a recent approach based on DSC and the SP-frame approach in
H.264, in terms of compression efficiency and decoder complexity.

vortex-free steady state as the rotation is increased above a critical
threshold. We focus on the second subsequent symmetry breaking, which occurs in
the weakly nonlinear regime. At slightly above threshold, we derive a
one-dimensional amplitude equation that describes the slow evolution of the
envelope of the initial instability. We show that the mechanism responsible for
initiating vortex formation is a modulational instability of the amplitude

economic networks, a large variety of systems can be described in terms of
multiplex networks formed by a set of nodes interacting through different

areas of complex networks, has also attracted great interest in both
theoretical and empirical researches. However, the vast majority of existing
researches mainly focus on the robustness of single-layer networks an
interdependent networks, how multiplex networks respond to potential attack is
still short of further exploration. Here we study the robustness of multiplex
networks under two attack strategies: layer node-based random attack and layer
node-based targeted attack. A theoretical analysis framework is proposed to
calculate the critical threshold and the size of giant component of multiplex
networks when a fraction of layer nodes are removed randomly or intentionally.
Via numerous simulations, it is unveiled that the theoretical method can
accurately predict the threshold and the size of giant component, irrespective
of attack strategies. Moreover, we also compare the robustness of multiplex
networks under multiplex node-based attack and layer node-based attack, and
find that layer node-based attack makes multiplex networks more vulnerable,
regardless of average degree and underlying topology. Our finding may shed new
light on the protection of multiplex networks.

localized on the conjugated groups independently shift with applied bias. While
in the forward polarity a resonance condition is met, enhancing conductance, in
the reversed direction molecular electronic states shift away from each other,
resulting in small tunneling currents. In the absence of interactions with a
thermal environment (consisting e.g. internal vibrations, solvent),
rectification ratios reach three orders of magnitude. We introduce decoherence

interaction energy of electrons with the environment and $v$ the tunneling
energy across the saturated link, the diode is still highly effective, though
rectification ratios are cut down by a factor of 2-4 compared to the coherent

refined design involving four orbitals, with a pair of closely spaced states at

contribution of droplet deformability, commonly considered in the study of
droplet migration under steady shear flow conditions. We show that the imposed
oscillation brings in additional time complexity in the droplet movement,
realized through temporally varying drop-shape, flow direction and the inertial
response of the droplet. As a consequence, we observe a spatially complicated
pathway of the droplet along the transverse direction, in sharp contrast to the
smooth migration under a similar yet steady shear flow condition. Intuitively,
the longitudinal component of the droplet movement is in tandem with the flow
continuity and evolves with time at the same frequency as that of the imposed
oscillation, although, with an amplitude decreasing with the frequency. The
time complexity of the transverse component of the movement pattern, however,
cannot by rationalized through such intuitive arguments. Towards bringing out
the underlying physics, we further endeavor in a reciprocal identity based

an alternative proof of the fact that every function computed by an

useful solution. Our results are applicable even when the initial solution is
outside any region of local convexity, and even when the problem is globally
concave. Working in a non-asymptotic framework, we show that our conditions are
satisfied for a wide range of concrete models, including matrix regression,
structured PCA, matrix completion with real and quantized observations, matrix
decomposition, and graph clustering problems. Simulation results show excellent
agreement with the theoretical predictions.

  Crowdsourcing",,,"10.1145/2818048.2820072",,"cs.HC cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  People from all over the world use social media to share thoughts and
opinions about events, and understanding what people say through these channels
has been of increasing interest to researchers, journalists, and marketers
alike. However, while automatically generated summaries enable people to
consume large amounts of data efficiently, they do not provide the context
needed for a viewer to fully understand an event. Narrative structure can
provide templates for the order and manner in which this data is presented to
create stories that are oriented around narrative elements rather than
summaries made up of facts. In this paper, we use narrative theory as a
framework for identifying the links between social media content. To do this,
we designed crowdsourcing tasks to generate summaries of events based on
commonly used narrative templates. In a controlled study, for certain types of
events, people were more emotionally engaged with stories created with
narrative structure and were also more likely to recommend them to others
compared to summaries created without narrative structure.

subsample of the Greiner GRB catalogue, which contains 314 objects with
redshift $0<z<2.5$ (244 of them discovered by the Swift GRB Mission). We try to
reconcile the dilemma between the new observations and the current theory of
structure formation and growth. To test the results against the possible biases
in redshift determination and the incompleteness of the Greiner sample, we also
apply our analysis to the 244 GRBs discovered by Swift and the subsample
presented by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Host Galaxy Legacy Survey (SHOALS). The
real space two-point correlation function (2PCF) of GRBs, $\xi(r),$ is
calculated using a Landy-Szalay estimator. We perform a standard least-$\chi^2$
fit to the measured 2PCFs of GRBs. We use the best-fit 2PCF to deduce a
recently defined homogeneity scale. The homogeneity scale, $R_H$, is defined as
the comoving radius of the sphere inside which the number of GRBs $N(<r)$ is
proportional to $r^3$ within $1\%$, or equivalently above which the correlation
dimension of the sample $D_2$ is within $1\%$ of $D_2=3$. For the Swift
subsample of 244 GRBs, the correlation length and slope are $r_0= 387.51 \pm
132.75~h^{-1}$Mpc and $\gamma = 1.57\pm 0.65$ (at $1\sigma$ confidence level).
The corresponding scale for a homogeneous distribution of GRBs is $r\geq
7,700~h^{-1}$Mpc. The results help to alleviate the tension between the new
discovery of the excess clustering of GRBs and the cosmological principle of
large-scale homogeneity. It implies that very massive structures in the
relatively local Universe do not necessarily violate the cosmological principle
and could conceivably be present.

Unruh radiation is negative and smaller than that of Larmor radiation by one
order in a/m, where a is the constant acceleration and m is the mass of the
particle. Thus, the Unruh radiation appears to be a suppression of the
classical Larmor radiation. The quantum interference effect plays an important
role in this unique signature. The results is consistent with the predictions
of a model consisting of a particle coupled to a massless scalar field as well

the visibility profiles at the two frequencies and calculate the spectral index
($\alpha_{\rm{mm}}$). The observations of SR21 show a clear shift in the
visibility nulls, indicating radial variations of the inner edge of the cavity
at the two wavelengths. Notable radial variations of the spectral index are
also detected for SR21 with values of $\alpha_{\rm{mm}}{\sim}3.8-4.2$ in the
inner region ($r<35$ AU) and $\alpha_{\rm{mm}}{\sim}2.6-3.0$ outside. An
axisymmetric ring (which we call the ring model) or a ring with the addition of
an azimuthal Gaussian profile, for mimicking a vortex structure (which we call
the vortex model), is assumed for fitting the disk morphology. For SR21, the
ring model better fits the emission at 336GHz, conversely the vortex model
better fits the 689GHz emission. For HD135344B, neither a significant shift in
the null of the visibilities nor radial variations of $\alpha_{\rm{mm}}$ are
detected. Furthermore, for HD135344B, the vortex model fits both frequencies
better than the ring model. However, the azimuthal extent of the vortex
increases with wavelength, contrary to model predictions for particle trapping
by anticyclonic vortices. For both disks, the azimuthal variations of
$\alpha_{\rm{mm}}$ remain uncertain to confirm azimuthal trapping. The
comparison of the current data with a generic model of dust evolution that
includes planet-disk interaction suggests that particles in the outer disk of
SR21 have grown to millimetre sizes and have accumulated in a radial pressure
bump, whereas with the current resolution there is not clear evidence of radial
trapping in HD135344B, although it cannot be excluded either.

and/or continuum slow waves in magnetic structures of the solar atmosphere as,
e.g., coronal arcades, can create the illusion of wave propagation across the
magnetic field. This phenomenon could be erroneously interpreted as fast
magnetosonic waves. The cross-field propagation due to phase mixing of
continuum waves is apparent because there is no real propagation of energy
across the magnetic surfaces. We investigate the continuous Alfv\'{e}n and slow
spectra in 2D Cartesian equilibrium models with a purely poloidal magnetic
field. We show that apparent superslow propagation across the magnetic surfaces
in solar coronal structures is a consequence of the existence of continuum
Alfv\'{e}n waves and continuum slow waves that naturally live on those
structures and phase mix as time evolves. The apparent cross-field phase
velocity is related to the spatial variation of the local Alfv\'{e}n/slow
frequency across the magnetic surfaces and is slower than the Alfv\'{e}n/sound
velocities for typical coronal conditions. Understanding the nature of the
apparent cross-field propagation is important for the correct analysis of
numerical simulations and the correct interpretation of observations.

often require dealing with partially observable states. It is in general very
challenging to construct and infer hidden states as they often depend on the

knowledge. In this work, we investigate a deep-learning approach to learning
the representation of states in partially observable tasks, with minimal prior

models that combines the strength of both supervised learning (SL) and
reinforcement learning (RL), trained in a joint fashion: The SL component can
be a recurrent neural networks (RNN) or its long short-term memory (LSTM)
version, which is equipped with the desired property of being able to capture
long-term dependency on history, thus providing an effective way of learning
the representation of hidden states. The RL component is a deep Q-network (DQN)
that learns to optimize the control for maximizing long-term rewards. Extensive
experiments in a direct mailing campaign problem demonstrate the effectiveness
and advantages of the proposed approach, which performs the best among a set of
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Data. Results: We found that 151 of the assessed 1778 contributions contain a

empirical results is well below the average compared to computer science

turn of this century. When beginning our WR searches using infrared techniques
it was not clear whether WR number predictions were too optimistic or whether
there was more hidden behind interstellar and circumstellar extinction. During
the last decade we pioneered a technique of exploiting the near- and
mid-infrared continuum colours for individual point sources provided by
large-format surveys of the Galaxy, including 2MASS and Spitzer/GLIMPSE, to
pierce through the dust and reveal newly discovered WR stars throughout the
Galactic Plane. The key item to the colour discrimination is via the
characteristic infrared spectral index produced by the strong winds of the WR
stars, combined with dust extinction, which place WR stars in a relatively
depopulated area of infrared colour-colour diagrams. The use of the
Spitzer/GLIMPSE 8$\mu$m and, more recently, WISE 22$\mu$m fluxes together with
cross-referencing with X-ray measurements in selected Galactic regions have
enabled improved candidate lists that increased our confirmation success rate,
achieved via follow-up infrared and optical spectroscopy. To date a total of
102 new WR stars have been found with many more candidates still available for

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1411.4411",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper deals with the issue of ecological bias in ecological inference.
We provide an explicit formulation of the conditions required for the ordinary
ecological regression to produce unbiased estimates and argue that, when these
conditions are violated, any method of ecological inference is going to produce
biased estimates. These findings are clarified and supported by empirical
evidence provided by comparing the results of three main ecological inference
methods with those of multilevel logistic regression applied to a unique set of
individual data on voting behaviour. The main findings of our study have two
important implications that apply to all situations where the conditions for no
ecological bias are violated: (i) only ecological inference methods that allow
to model the effect of covariates have a chance to produce unbiased estimates;
(ii) the set of covariates to be included in the model to remove bias is
limited to the marginal proportions. Finally, our results suggest that, when
the association between two ecological variables is very weak, it is not
possible to obtain unbiased estimates even by an appropriate model that
accounts for the effect of relevant covariates.

process of a wind farm at a sampling frequency of 1Hz. When conditioning on
various wind direction sectors, the dynamics of the conversion process appear
as a fluctuating trajectory around an average IEC-like power curve, see section
II. Our approach is to consider the wind farm as a dynamical system that can be
described as a stochastic drift/diffusion model, where a drift coefficient
describes the attraction towards the power curve and a diffusion coefficient
quantifies additional turbulent fluctuations. These stochastic coefficients are
inserted into a Langevin equation that, once properly adapted to our particular
system, models a synthetic signal of power output for any given wind
speed/direction signals, see section III. When combined with a pre-model for
turbulent wind fluctuations, the stochastic approach models the power output of
the wind farm at a sampling frequency of 1Hz using only ten-minute average
values of wind speed and directions. The stochastic signals generated are
compared to the measured signal, and show a good statistical agreement,
including a proper reproduction of the intermittent, gusty features measured.
In parallel, a second application for performance monitoring is introduced in
section IV. The drift coefficient can be used as a sensitive measure of the
global wind farm performance. When monitoring the wind farm as a whole, the
drift coefficient registers some significant deviation from normal operation if
one of twelve wind turbines is shut down during less than 4% of the time. Also,
intermittent anomalies can be detected more rapidly than when using ten-minute
averaging methods. Finally, a probabilistic description of the conversion
process is proposed and modeled in appendix A, that can in turn be used to
further improve the estimation of the stochastic coefficients.

the entropic cost of constraining the scaffold by inserting staple crossovers.
A rigorous thermodynamic model is difficult to implement as a result of the

particularly when loop closure exponents are taken to be larger than those for
ideal chains, introduce interactions between staples. These cooperative

surprised and saddened his mother by going all the way across the country to
Stanford to graduate school, where he completed his dissertation in 1969 under
the direction of Professor Herbert Solomon, making him an academic grandson of
Herman Rubin and Harold Hotelling. Alan then accepted a faculty position at the
University of Connecticut (UConn) where he was promoted to tenured associate
professor in 1975 and to full professor in 1980. A few years later he became
interested in decision theory, then empirical Bayes, which eventually led to
the publication of Gelfand and Smith [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 85 (1990)
398-409], the paper that introduced the Gibbs sampler to most statisticians and
revolutionized Bayesian computing. In the mid-1990s, Alan's interests turned
strongly to spatial statistics, leading to fundamental contributions in
spatially-varying coefficient models, coregionalization, and spatial boundary
analysis (wombling). He spent 33 years on the faculty at UConn, retiring in
2002 to become the James B. Duke Professor of Statistics and Decision Sciences
at Duke University, serving as chair from 2007-2012. At Duke, he has continued
his work in spatial methodology while increasing his impact in the
environmental sciences. To date, he has published over 260 papers and 6 books;
he has also supervised 36 Ph.D. dissertations and 10 postdocs. This interview

the non-local-in-time theory can be renormalized consistently. Another
possibility is to include the viscosity in the linear propagator, resulting in
exponential damping at high wavenumber. The resulting local-in-time theory is
then renormalizable to one loop, requiring less free parameters for its
renormalization.

into desired ordered and disordered phases is amongst the hottest topics in
contemporary material science. To this end, microscopic units of varying
complexity, aimed at assembling the target phases, have been thought, designed,
investigated and built. Such a path usually requires laborious fabrication
techniques, especially when a specific funcionalisation of the building blocks
is required. Telechelic star polymers, i.e., star polymers made of a number $f$
of di-block copolymers consisting of solvophobic and solvophilic monomers
grafted on a central anchoring point, spontaneously self-assemble into soft
patchy particles featuring attractive spots (patches) on the surface. Here we
show that the tunability of such a system can be widely extended by controlling
the physical and chemical parameters of the solution. Indeed, at fixed external
conditions the self-assembly behaviour depends only on the number of arms
and/or on the ratio of solvophobic to solvophilic monomers. However, changes in
temperature and/or solvent quality makes it possible to reliably change the
number and size of the attractive patches. This allows to steer the mesoscopic
self-assembly behaviour without modifying the microscopic constituents.
Interestingly, we also demonstrate that diverse combinations of the parameters
can generate stars with the same number of patches but different radial and
angular stiffness. This mechanism could provide a neat way of further
fine-tuning the elastic properties of the supramolecular network without
changing its topology.

averages in the fraction of time occupied by a specific sign of the KPZ-class
fluctuations. The distribution of its long-time average converges to nontrivial
broad functions, which are found to differ significantly from that of the
renewal process, but instead be characteristic of KPZ. Thus, we obtain a new
type of ergodicity breaking for such systems with many-body interactions. Our
analysis also detects qualitative differences in time-correlation properties of
circular and flat KPZ-class interfaces, which were suggested from previous
experiments and simulations but still remain theoretically unexplained.

configurations, the local lattice actions reduce to the Hilbert-Palatini
action, a cosmological term and the three topological terms of dimension four
of Pontyagin, Euler and Nieh-Yan. Consistency conditions for a topologically
hypercubic complex with null 4-simplexes are derived and a topological lattice
theory that enforces these non-local constraints is constructed. The lattice
integration measure is derived from an \SLC-invariant integration measure by
localization of the non-local structure group. This measure is unique up to a
density that depends on the local 4-volume. It can be expressed in terms of
manifestly coordinate invariant geometrical quantities. The density provides an
invariant regularization of the lattice integration measure that suppresses
configurations with small local 4-volumes. Amplitudes conditioned on geodesic
distances between local observables have a physical interpretation and may have
a smooth ultraviolet limit. Numerical studies on small lattices in the
unphysical strong coupling regime of large imaginary cosmological constant
suggest that this model of triangulated causal manifolds is finite. Two
topologically different triangulations of space-time are discussed: a single,
causally connected universe and a duoverse with two causally disjoint connected
components. In the duoverse, two hypercubic sublattices are causally disjoint
but the local curvature depends on fields of both sublattices. This may
simulate effects of dark matter in the continuum limit.

demonstrate that the local properties of both maps are predominantly Gaussian.

get assigned a new IP address. This causes a routing problem since the MN will
not be reachable with its previous IP address known to the other communication
party. Real time applications might suffer from connection drops, which is
recognized as inconvenience in the currently used service, unless some solution

Borrowing from the rich literatures on causality and finite-population sampling
theory, this paper develops a modeling framework that affords answers to
several important questions, including: exactly what hypothesis is being
tested, what model assumptions are being made, and are there other, perhaps
better, approaches to testing a no-effect hypothesis? The framework lends
itself to clear descriptions of three main inference approaches: process-based,
randomization-based, and selection-based. It also promotes careful
consideration of model assumptions and targets of inference, and highlights the
importance of randomization. Along the way, Fisher-type randomization tests are
compared to permutation tests and a less well-known Neyman-type randomization
test. A simulation study compares the operating characteristics of the
Neyman-type randomization test to those of the other more familiar tests.

Comparison of the brightness of stars between LASCO C2 total and polarized

the field of astronomy. The biggest future milestone is to determine whether
life exists on such habitable exoplanets. In that context, oxygen in the
atmosphere has been considered strong evidence for the presence of
photosynthetic organisms. In this paper, we show that a previously unconsidered
photochemical mechanism by titanium(IV) oxide (titania) can produce abiotic
oxygen from liquid water under near ultraviolet (NUV) lights on the surface of
exoplanets. Titania works as a photocatalyst to dissociate liquid water in this
process. This mechanism offers a different source of a possibility of abiotic
oxygen in atmospheres of exoplanets from previously considered
photodissociation of water vapor in upper atmospheres by extreme ultraviolet
(XUV) light. Our order-of-magnitude estimation shows that possible amounts of
oxygen produced by this abiotic mechanism can be comparable with or even more
than that in the atmosphere of the current Earth, depending on the amount of
active surface area for this mechanism. We conclude that titania may act as a
potential source of false signs of life on habitable exoplanets.

finite set of nonlinear functionals of $u$, subject to additive noise; we
denote this observed data by $y$. Our interest is in the reconstruction of
piecewise continuous fields in which the discontinuity set is described by a
finite number of geometric parameters. Natural applications include groundwater
flow and electrical impedance tomography. We take a Bayesian approach, placing
a prior distribution on $u$ and determining the conditional distribution on $u$
given the data $y$. It is then natural to study maximum a posterior (MAP)
estimators. Recently (Dashti et al 2013) it has been shown that MAP estimators
can be characterised as minimisers of a generalised Onsager-Machlup functional,
in the case where the prior measure is a Gaussian random field. We extend this
theory to a more general class of prior distributions which allows for
piecewise continuous fields. Specifically, the prior field is assumed to be
piecewise Gaussian with random interfaces between the different Gaussians
defined by a finite number of parameters. We also make connections with recent
work on MAP estimators for linear problems and possibly non-Gaussian priors
(Helin, Burger 2015) which employs the notion of Fomin derivative.
  In showing applicability of our theory we focus on the groundwater flow and
EIT models, though the theory holds more generally. Numerical experiments are
implemented for the groundwater flow model, demonstrating the feasibility of
determining MAP estimators for these piecewise continuous models, but also that
the geometric formulation can lead to multiple nearby (local) MAP estimators.
We relate these MAP estimators to the behaviour of output from MCMC samples of
the posterior, obtained using a state-of-the-art function space
Metropolis-Hastings method.

outperformed by optical imaging in regards to the obtained resolution. In this
work we demonstrate near-field THz imaging with a single-pixel detector. We
project a time-varying optical mask onto a silicon wafer which is used to
spatially modulate a pulse of THz radiation. The far-field transmission
corresponding to each mask is recorded by a single element detector and this
data is used to reconstruct the image of an object placed on the far side of
the silicon wafer. We demonstrate a proof of principal application where we
image a printed circuit board on the underside of a 115{\mu}m thick silicon

and the inherent sensitivity to local conductivity provided by the THz probe
frequencies, we show that it is possible to detect fissures in the circuitry

simulated, then compared to recent experimental measurements (Scheeler et al.
2014a). Qualitative comparisons using three-dimensional vorticity isosurfaces
and lines, then quantitative comparisons using the helicity. To have a single
initial reconnection, as in the experiments, the trefoil is perturbed by 4 weak
vortex rings. Initially there is a long period with deformations similar to the
experiment during which the energy, continuum helicity and topological
self-linking number are all preserved. In the next period, once reconnection
has clearly begun, a Reynolds number independent fraction of the initial
helicity is dissipated in a finite time. In contrast, the experimental analysis
finds that the helicity inferred from the trajectories of hydrogen bubbles is
preserved during reconnection. Since vortices reconnect gradually in a
classical fluid, it is suggested that the essential difference is in the
interpretation of the reconnection timescales associated with the observed
events. Both the time when reconnection begins, and when it ends. Supporting
evidence for the strong numerical helicity depletion is provided by spectra, a
profile and visualisations of the helicity that show the formation of negative
helicity on the periphery of the trefoil. A single case with the same
trajectory and circulation, but a thinner core, replicates this helicity
depletion despite larger Sobolev norms, showing that the reconnection timescale
is determined by the initial trajectory and circulation of the trefoil, not the
initial vorticity. This case also shows that the very small viscosity,
$\nu\rightarrow 0$ mathematical restrictions upon finite-time dissipative
behavior do not apply to this range of modest viscosities.

in a spectral hole. A long lived narrow spectral hole is created by optical
pumping in the inhomogeneous absorption profile of a Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$
crystal. Optical pulses sent through the spectral hole experience a strong
reduction of their group velocity and are spatially compressed in the crystal.
A short Raman pulse transfers the optical excitation to the spin state before
the light pulse exits the crystal, effectively stopping the light. After a
controllable delay, a second Raman pulse is sent, which leads to the emission
of the stored photons. We reach storage and retrieval efficiencies for bright
pulses of up to $39\,\%$ in a $5 \,\mathrm{mm}$-long crystal. We also show that
our device works at the single photon level by storing and retrieving
$3\,\mathrm{\mu s}$-long weak coherent pulses with efficiencies up to $31\,\%$,
demonstrating the most efficient spin-wave solid state optical memory at the
single-photon level so far. We reach an unconditional noise level of
$(9\pm1)\times 10^{-3}$ photons per pulse in a detection window of
$4\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ leading to a signal-to-noise ratio of $33 \pm 4$ for an
average input photon number of 1, making our device promising for long-lived
storage of non-classical light.

based on the Randomized Shortest Paths (RSP) framework, which fill a gap
between traditional network centrality measures based on shortest paths and
more recent methods considering random walks or current flows. The framework
defines Boltzmann probability distributions over paths of the network which
focus on the shortest paths, but also take into account longer paths depending
on an inverse temperature parameter. RSP's have previously proven to be useful
in defining distance measures on networks. In this work we study their utility
in quantifying the importance of the nodes of a network. The proposed RSP
betweenness centralities combine, in an optimal way, the ideas of using the
shortest and purely random paths for analysing the roles of network nodes,
avoiding issues involving these two paradigms. We present the derivations of
these measures and how they can be computed in an efficient way. In addition,
we show with real world examples the potential of the RSP betweenness
centralities in identifying interesting nodes of a network that more
traditional methods might fail to notice.

new findings. T2K has shown the first $\bar \nu_e$ appearance data while
NO$\nu$A has released the first $\nu_e$ appearance results. These data are of
particular importance because they allow us to probe for the first time in a
direct (or manifest) way the leptonic CP-violation. In fact, it is the first
time that a hint of CP-violation arises from the comparison of the observations
of neutrinos and antineutrinos. We consider the implications of such new
results both for the standard 3-flavor framework and for the non-standard 3+1
scheme involving one sterile neutrino species. The 3-flavor analysis shows a
consolidation of the previous trends, namely a slight preference for $\sin
\delta <0$, disfavoring CP conservation ($\delta =0, \pi$) with a statistical
significance close to $90\%$ C.L., and a mild preference (at more than 68\%
C.L.) for the normal hierarchy. In a 3+1 framework, the data constrain two
CP-phases ($\delta_{13} \equiv \delta$ and $\delta_{14}$), which exhibit a
slight preference for the common value $\delta_{13} \simeq \delta_{14} \simeq
-\pi/2 $. Interestingly, in the enlarged four neutrino scheme the preference
for the normal hierarchy found within the 3-flavor framework completely
disappears. This indicates that light sterile neutrinos may constitute a
potential source of fragility in the capability of the two LBL experiments of
discriminating the neutrino mass hierarchy.

quantitative insights hinting at a strong geographical confinement of human

terms of both finance and human effort. In this paper, we propose a simple to
complex (STC) framework in which only image-level annotations are utilized to
learn DCNNs for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first train an initial
segmentation network called Initial-DCNN with the saliency maps of simple
images (i.e., those with a single category of major object(s) and clean
background). These saliency maps can be automatically obtained by existing
bottom-up salient object detection techniques, where no supervision information
is needed. Then, a better network called Enhanced-DCNN is learned with
supervision from the predicted segmentation masks of simple images based on the
Initial-DCNN as well as the image-level annotations. Finally, more pixel-level
segmentation masks of complex images (two or more categories of objects with
cluttered background), which are inferred by using Enhanced-DCNN and
image-level annotations, are utilized as the supervision information to learn
the Powerful-DCNN for semantic segmentation. Our method utilizes $40$K simple
images from Flickr.com and 10K complex images from PASCAL VOC for step-wisely
boosting the segmentation network. Extensive experimental results on PASCAL VOC

STC framework compared with other state-of-the-arts.

generate additional Reynolds shear stresses augmenting the (base) turbulent

two modes in the complex phase velocity space follow each other closely for

brain is an increasing challenge of modern neuroscience. Such models provide a
bridge between structure and activity, and identify the mechanisms giving rise
to experimental observations. Nevertheless, structurally realistic network
models of spiking neurons are necessarily underconstrained even if experimental
data on brain connectivity are incorporated to the best of our knowledge.
Guided by physiological observations, any model must therefore explore the
parameter ranges within the uncertainty of the data. Based on simulation
results alone, however, the mechanisms underlying stable and physiologically
realistic activity often remain obscure. We here employ a mean-field reduction
of the dynamics, which allows us to include activity constraints into the
process of model construction. We shape the phase space of a multi-scale
network model of the vision-related areas of macaque cortex by systematically
refining its connectivity. Fundamental constraints on the activity, i.e.,
prohibiting quiescence and requiring global stability, prove sufficient to
obtain realistic layer- and area-specific activity. Only small adaptations of
the structure are required, showing that the network operates close to an
instability. The procedure identifies components of the network critical to its
collective dynamics and creates hypotheses for structural data and future
experiments. The method can be applied to networks involving any neuron model
with a known gain function.

MHD simulations of black hole accretion at super-critical mass accretion rates,
$\dot{M} > \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$. We use these simulations to study how disk
properties are modified when we vary the black hole mass, the black hole spin,
or the mass accretion rate. In the case of a non-rotating black hole, we find
that the total efficiency is of order $3\%\dot M c^2$, approximately a factor
of two less than the efficiency of a standard thin accretion disk. The
radiation flux in the funnel along the axis is highly super-Eddington, but only
a small fraction of the energy released by accretion escapes in this region.
The bulk of the $3\%\dot M c^2$ of energy emerges farther out in the disk,
either in the form of photospheric emission or as a wind. In the case of a
black hole with a spin parameter of 0.7, we find a larger efficiency of about
$8\%\dot M c^2$. By comparing the relative importance of advective and
diffusive radiation transport, we show that photon trapping is effective near
the equatorial plane. However, near the disk surface, vertical transport of
radiation by diffusion dominates. We compare the properties of our fiducial
three-dimensional run with those of an equivalent two-dimensional axisymmetric
model with a mean-field dynamo. The latter simulation runs nearly 100 times
faster than the three-dimensional simulation, and gives very similar results

constructed by using a divergence-regularization in one of the cell problems.
This allows us to introduce fine-scale correctors that are not subject to a

implemented. To analyze the method, we first revisit classical homogenization
theory for time-harmonic Maxwell equations and derive a new homogenization
result that makes use of the divergence-regularization in the two-scale
homogenized equation. We then show that the HMM is equivalent to a
discretization of this equation. In particular, writing both problems in a
fully coupled two-scale formulation is the crucial starting point for a
corresponding numerical analysis of the method. With this approach we are able
to prove rigorous a priori error estimates in the $\mathbf{H}(\mbox{curl})$-

observed to originate mostly in parts of the concave region or ""neck"" between
its two lobes. Since activity is driven by the sublimation of volatiles, this
is a puzzling result because this area is less exposed to the Sun and is
therefore expected to be cooler on average (Sierks et al. 2015).
  We used a thermophysical model that takes into account thermal inertia,
global self-heating, and shadowing, to compute surface temperatures of the
comet. We found that, for every rotation in the August--December 2014 period,
some parts of the neck region undergo the fastest temperature variations of the
comet's surface precisely because they are shadowed by their surrounding
terrains. Our work suggests that these fast temperature changes are correlated
to the early activity of the comet, and we put forward the hypothesis that
erosion related to thermal cracking is operating at a high rate on the neck
region due to these rapid temperature variations. This may explain why the neck
contains some ice --as opposed to most other parts of the surface (Capaccioni
et al. 2015)-- and why it is the main source of the comet's early activity
(Sierks et al. 2015).
  In a broader context, these results indicate that thermal cracking can
operate faster on atmosphereless bodies with significant concavities than
implied by currently available estimates (Delbo' et al. 2014).

displacement using a two pixel or 'split' detector. We calculate the maximum
likelihood estimator, and compute its asymptotic mean-squared-error via the
Fisher information. Although the signal-to-noise ratio is known to be simply
related to the Fisher information under idealised detection, we find the two
measures of precision differ markedly for a split detector. We show that a
greater signal-to-noise ratio 'before' the detector leads to a greater
information penalty, unless adaptive realignment is used. We find that with an
initially balanced split detector, tuning the normalised difference in counts
to 0.884753... gives the highest posterior Fisher information, and that this
provides an improvement by at least a factor of about 2.5 over operating in the
usual linear regime. We discuss the implications for weak-value amplification,
a popular probabilistic signal amplification technique.

describe the situation where movement of individuals occurs on a faster time
scale than the demographic (population) time scale, and we cannot determine
population growth based on local density. However, most of the results reported
so far for such systems have only been verified numerically and for a
particular choice of model functions, which obviously casts doubts about these
findings. In this paper, we analyse a class of integro-differential
predator-prey models with a highly mobile predator in a heterogeneous
environment, and we reveal the main factors stabilizing such systems. In
particular, we explore an ecologically relevant case of interactions in a
highly eutrophic environment, where the prey carrying capacity can be formally
set to 'infinity'. We investigate two main scenarios: (i) the spatial gradient
of the growth rate is due to abiotic factors only, and (ii) the local growth
rate depends on the global density distribution across the environment (e.g.
due to non-local self-shading). For an arbitrary spatial gradient of the prey
growth rate, we analytically investigate the possibility of the predator-prey
equilibrium in such systems and we explore the conditions of stability of this
equilibrium. In particular, we demonstrate that for a Holling type I (linear)
functional response, the predator can stabilize the system at low prey density
even for an 'unlimited' carrying capacity. We conclude that the interplay
between spatial heterogeneity in the prey growth and fast displacement of the
predator across the habitat works as an efficient stabilizing mechanism.

(1) If one applies control signals as determined from the structural
controllability theory, there is a high probability that the control energy
will diverge. Especially, if a network is deemed controllable using a single
driving signal, then most likely the energy will diverge. (2) The energy
required for control exhibits a power-law scaling behavior. (3) Applying
additional control signals at proper nodes in the network can reduce and
optimize the energy cost. We identify the fundamental structures embedded in
the network, the longest control chains, which determine the control energy and
give rise to the power-scaling behavior. (To our knowledge, this was not
reported in any previous work on control of complex networks.) In addition, the
issue of control precision is addressed. These results are supported by
extensive simulations from model and real networks, physical reasoning, and
mathematical analyses.

that when the time variable $x_0$ increases this solution splits into two

finite time, and the second part, with the energy $E_2=E_0+E_1>E_0$, escaping,
under some conditions, to the infinity when $x_0\rightarrow +\infty$. Thus we
get the superradiance phenomenon. In the case of the Kerr metric the
superradiance phenomenon is ""short-lived"", since both the solutions with
positive and negative energies cross the outer event horizon in a finite time
(modulo $O(\frac{1}{k})$) where $k$ is a large parameter. We show that these

This paper presents a new approach that uses an adaptive convex combination of

dynamically to the sparsity of the system. Thus works well in both sparse and

produced by either of the component filters. For highly sparse systems,
depending on the value of the proportionality constant ($\rho$) in ZA-APA

source in noisy and reverberant environments. For a given binaural microphone
setup, the binaural response corresponding to the direct-path propagation of a
single source is a function of the source direction. In practice, this response
is contaminated by noise and reverberations. The direct-path relative transfer
function (DP-RTF) is defined as the ratio between the direct-path acoustic
transfer function of the two channels. We propose a method to estimate the
DP-RTF from the noisy and reverberant microphone signals in the short-time
Fourier transform domain. First, the convolutive transfer function
approximation is adopted to accurately represent the impulse response of the
sensors in the STFT domain. Second, the DP-RTF is estimated by using the auto-
and cross-power spectral densities at each frequency and over multiple frames.
In the presence of stationary noise, an inter-frame spectral subtraction
algorithm is proposed, which enables to achieve the estimation of noise-free
auto- and cross-power spectral densities. Finally, the estimated DP-RTFs are
concatenated across frequencies and used as a feature vector for the
localization of speech source. Experiments with both simulated and real data
show that the proposed localization method performs well, even under severe
adverse acoustic conditions, and outperforms state-of-the-art localization
methods under most of the acoustic conditions.

GeV$^{-1}$ implies that they are thermally produced through $e^+ e^-\to \bar
\nu_h \nu_h$ in the early phase of the core collapse, whereas a heavy--light
transition moment $\mu_{\rm tr}\approx 10^{-8}$ GeV$^{-1}$ allows their decay
$\nu_h\to \nu_i \gamma$ with a lifetime around $10^{-3}$ s. This type of
electromagnetic couplings has been recently proposed to explain the excess of
electron-like events in baseline experiments. We show that the production and
decay of these heavy neutrinos would transport energy from the central regions
of the star to distances $d\approx 400$ km, providing a very efficient
mechanism to enhance the supernova shock front and heat the material behind it.

incorporates different mechanisms acting on different spatial and temporal
scales, since in organisms the workings of all components, such as organelles,
cells, and organs interrelate. This inherent interdependency between diverse
biological mechanisms, both on the same and on different scales, provides the
functioning of an organism capable of maintaining homeostasis and physiological
stability through numerous feedback loops. Thus, developing models of organisms
and their constituents should be done within the overall systemic context of
the studied phenomena. We introduce such a method for modeling growth and
regeneration of livers at the organ scale, considering it a part of the overall
multi-scale biochemical and biophysical processes of an organism. Our method is
based on the earlier discovered general growth law, postulating that any
biological growth process comprises a uniquely defined distribution of
nutritional resources between maintenance needs and biomass production. Based
on this law, we introduce a liver growth model that allows to accurately
predicting the growth of liver transplants in dogs and liver grafts in humans.
Using this model, we find quantitative growth characteristics, such as the time
point when the transition period after surgery is over and the liver resumes
normal growth, rates at which hepatocytes are involved in proliferation, etc.
We then use the model to determine and quantify otherwise unobservable
metabolic properties of livers.

Based on the obtained results and analysis of available biological models, we
propose a general framework for modeling biological phenomena and discuss how
it can be used in Virtual Liver Network project. The foundational idea of the
study is that growth of cells, organs, systems and whole organisms, besides
biomolecular machinery, is influenced by biophysical mechanisms acting at
different scale levels. In particular, the general growth law uniquely defines
distribution of nutritional resources between maintenance needs and biomass
synthesis at each phase of growth and at each scale level. We exemplify the
approach considering metabolic properties of growing human and dog livers and
liver transplants. A procedure for verification of obtained results has been
introduced too. We found that two examined dogs have high metabolic rates
consuming about 0.62 and 1 gram of nutrients per cubic centimeter of liver per
day, and verified this using the proposed verification procedure. We also
evaluated consumption rate of nutrients in human livers, determining it to be
about 0.088 gram of nutrients per cubic centimeter of liver per day for males,
and about 0.098 for females. This noticeable difference can be explained by
evolutionary development, which required females to have greater liver
processing capacity to support pregnancy. We also found how much nutrients go
to biomass synthesis and maintenance at each phase of liver and liver
transplant growth. Obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach can
be used for finding metabolic characteristics of cells, organs, and whole
organisms, which can further serve as important inputs for many applications in
biology (protein expression), biotechnology (synthesis of substances), and
medicine.

controversy on the fundamental concepts followed Chen et al proposal: the basic
idea is to split the gauge potential into pure gauge and physical components
motivated by the gauge symmetry. We term it gauge symmetry paradigm (GSP) to
distinguish it from the well-known inertial frame dependent
transverse-longitudinal decomposition (TLP). A thorough study adhering to the
traditional meaning of Lorentz covariance and gauge invariance is reported; it
leads to a new result: logically consistent development of GSP does not exist
and Chen et al proposal turns out to be either trivial or metamorphosed into
TLP. Going beyond the controversy and the spin sum rules the necessity for a
nonperurbative QCD approach to address the proton spin problem is underlined.
We suggest topological approach: generalized de Rham theorems for QCD, and spin
as a topological invariant for baryons are discussed. Nonabelian Stokes theorem
is applied to derive color flux for the closed loop in a variant of Burkardt's
U-shaped path. Similarity between Chen et al decomposition and Kondo

propagate through hidden functional dependencies. Many studies focused on the
critical conditions and catastrophic consequences of cascading failures.
However, to understand the network vulnerability and mitigate the cascading
overload failures, the knowledge of how the failures propagate in time and
space is essential but still missing. Here we study the spatio-temporal
propagation behavior of cascading overload failures analytically and
numerically. The cascading overload failures are found to spread radially from
the center of the initial failure with an approximately constant velocity. The
propagation velocity decreases with increasing tolerance, and can be well
predicted by our theoretical framework with one single correction for all the
tolerance values. This propagation velocity is found similar in various model
networks and real network structures. Our findings may help to predict and
mitigate the dynamics of cascading overload failures in realistic systems.

only slightly accelerated. The finding that the synchrotron emission expands
more rapidly than the filaments supports the picture that the latter are the

configuration emerges. We use superstatistics to describe the hierarchical

reproduces the stylized fact of volatility clustering. Our results indicate
that there is a functional (but not literal) balance between excessive profits

during the century. The idea of introducing compactified spatial dimensions
originated by Kaluza and Klein. Following their approach, several model were
built representing quantum numbers (e.g. charges) as compactified space-time
dimensions. Such geometrized theoretical descriptions of the fundamental
interactions might lead us to get closer to the unification of the principle
theories.
  Here, we apply a $3+1_C+1$ dimensional theory, which contains one extra
compactified spatial dimension $1_C$ in connection with the flavour quantum
number in Quantum Chromodynamics. Within our model the size of the $1_C$
dimension is proportional to the inverse mass-difference of the first low-mass
baryon states. We used this phenomena to apply in a compact star model -- a
natural laboratory for testing the theory of strong interaction and the
gravitational theory in parallel.
  Our aim is to test the modification of the measurable macroscopical
parameters of a compact Kaluza-Klein star by varying the size of the
compactified extra dimension. Since larger the $R_C$ the smaller the mass
difference between the first spokes of the Kaluza-Klein ladder resulting
smaller-mass stars. Using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equation, we
investigate the $M$-$R$ diagram and the dependence of the maximum mass of
compact stars. Besides testing the validity of our model we compare our results
to the existing observational data of pulsar properties for constraints.
