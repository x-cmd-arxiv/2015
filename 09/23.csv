correlations into bremsstrahlung from few-electron ions and atoms. Our approach
is based on the explicit formula for the electron density distribution in such
systems. We derive the closed analytical formula for the matrix elements which
are needed for highly accurate computations of atomic form-factors of
two-electron atoms and ions. We also discuss the energy loss due to
bremsstrahlung in a plasma which contains multi-charged ions and free
electrons. Bremsstrahlung from a high-temperature plasma is considered as well
as its role in the high-temperature burn-up of deuterium plasma.

ability to grow in different nutritional environments. Mechanistically, this
diversity arises predominantly through horizontal gene transfer, the exchange
of DNA between individuals from different strains. It has been hypothesized
that complex metabolic adaptations--those requiring the acquisition of multiple
distinct DNA segments--can evolve via selectively neutral intermediate steps;
an alternative explanation rests on the existence of intermediate environments
that make each individual DNA acquisition adaptive. However, it is unclear how
important changing environments are compared to neutral explorations of
phenotype space; more fundamentally, it is unknown what fraction of metabolic
adaptations are indeed complex. Here, we use metabolic network simulations to
show that all 3,363 phenotypic innovations observed in the evolutionary history
of 53 E. coli strains arose through the acquisition of a single DNA segment;
while we found no evidence for the contribution of selectively neutral
processes, 10.6% of adaptations to previously unviable environments relied on
the support of DNA acquisitions on earlier phylogenetic branches. 97.0% of all
metabolic phenotypes accessible for the E. coli pan-genome could be bestowed on
any ancestral strain by transferring a single DNA segment from one of the
extant strains. These results demonstrate an amazing ability of the E. coli
lineage to quickly adapt to previously inaccessible environments through a
single DNA acquisition, an ability likely to be mirrored in other clades of
generalist bacteria.

are compared with experimentally measured binding energies as well as with
theoretically predicted values from an established SHF code. The nuclear pasta
simulation is initialized in the so-called waffle geometry as obtained by the
Indiana University Molecular Dynamics (IUMD) code. The size of the unit cell is
24\:fm with an average density of about $\rho = 0.05 \:\mathrm{fm}^{-3}$,

spin-orbit forces are not included but will be added in the future. Within the

to the present observation $X_0$ a number $l$ of preceding observations may be
used for classification, thus taking a possible dependence structure into
account as it occurs e.g. in an ongoing classification of handwritten
characters. We treat the question how the performance of classifiers is
improved by using such additional information. For our analysis, a hidden
Markov model is used. Letting $R_l$ denote the minimal risk of
misclassification using $l$ preceding observations we show that the difference
$\sup_k |R_l - R_{l+k}|$ decreases exponentially fast as $l$ increases. This
suggests that a small $l$ might already lead to a noticeable improvement. To
follow this point we look at the use of past observations for kernel
classification rules. Our practical findings in simulated hidden Markov models
and in the classification of handwritten characters indicate that using $l=1$,
i.e. just the last preceding observation in addition to $X_0$, can lead to a
substantial reduction of the risk of misclassification. So, in the presence of
stochastic dependencies, we advocate to use $ X_{-1},X_0$ for finding the

holes) and shorter when the coronal temperature is higher (similar to that in
active regions). When the coronal temperature is high, the deceleration of the
chromospheric jets is consistent with the model in which deceleration is
determined by the periodic chromospheric shock waves. However, when the coronal
temperature is low, the gravitational deceleration becomes more important and
the chromospheric jets approach ballistic motion.

particular profile. This shape-changing ability could be extremely helpful for
rescue robots and those operating in unknown terrains and environments. In
changing shape, soft materials also store and release elastic energy, a feature
that can be exploited for effective robot movement. However, design and control
of these moving soft robots are non-trivial. The research presents design
methodology for a 3D-printed, motor-tendon actuated soft robot capable of
locomotion. In addition to shape change, the robot uses friction manipulation
mechanisms to effect locomotion. The motor-tendon actuators comprise of nylon
tendons embedded inside the soft body structure along a given path with one end
fixed on the body and the other attached to a motor. These actuators directly
control the deformation of the soft body which influences the robot locomotion
behavior. Static stress analysis is used as a tool for designing the shape of
the paths of these tendons embedded inside the body. The research also presents
a novel model-free learning-based control approach for soft robots which
interact with the environment at discrete contact points. This approach
involves discretization of factors dominating robot-environment interactions as
states, learning of the results as robot transitions between these robot states
and evaluation of desired periodic state control sequences optimizing a cost
function corresponding to a locomotion task (rotation or translation). The
clever discretization allows the framework to exist in robot's task space,
hence, facilitating calculation of control sequences without modeling the
actuator, body material or details of the friction mechanisms. The flexibility
of the framework is experimentally explored by applying it to robots with
different friction mechanisms and different shapes of tendon paths.

external field on the plane constitute the vector critical measures, a notion
that finds a natural motivation in several branches of analysis. We study in
depth the case of measures $\vec \mu=(\mu_1, \mu_2,\mu_3)$ when the mutual
interaction comprises both attracting and repelling forces.
  For arbitrary vector polynomial external fields we establish general
structural results about critical measures, such as their characterization in
terms of an algebraic equation solved by an appropriate combination of their
Cauchy transforms, and the symmetry properties (or the S-properties) exhibited
by such measures. In consequence, we conclude that vector critical measures are
supported on a finite number of analytic arcs, that are trajectories of a
quadratic differential globally defined on a three-sheeted Riemann surface. The
complete description of the so-called critical graph for such a differential is
the key to the construction of the critical measures.
  We illustrate these connections studying in depth for a one-parameter family
of critical measures under the action of a cubic external field. This choice is
motivated by the asymptotic analysis of a family of (non-hermitian) multiple
orthogonal polynomials, that is subject of a forthcoming paper. Here we compute
explicitly the Riemann surface and the corresponding quadratic differential,
and analyze the dynamics of its critical graph as a function of the parameter,
giving a detailed description of the occurring phase transitions. When
projected back to the complex plane, this construction gives us the complete
family of vector critical measures, that in this context turn out to be vector
equilibrium measures.

$1-4 \sigma$ fluctuations, in the redshift range $0 - 5$ using N-body
simulations. The halo bias of high redshift halos ($z \geq 2$) is found to be
strongly non-linear and scale-dependent on quasi-linear scales that are larger
than their virial radii ($0.5-10$ Mpc/h). However, at lower redshifts, the
scale-dependence of non-linear bias is weaker and and is of the order of a few
percent on quasi-linear scales at $z \sim 0$. We find that the redshift
evolution of the scale dependent bias of dark matter halos can be expressed as
a function of four physical parameters: the peak height of halos, the
non-linear matter correlation function at the scale of interest, an effective
power law index of the {\it rms} linear density fluctuations and the matter
density of the universe at the given redshift. This suggests that the
scale-dependence of halo bias is not a universal function of the dark matter
power spectrum, which is commonly assumed. We provide a fitting function for
the scale dependent halo bias as a function of these four parameters. Our fit
reproduces the simulation results to an accuracy of better than 4 % over the
redshift range $0\leq z \leq 5$. We also extend our model by expressing the
non-linear bias as a function of the linear matter correlation function. It is
important to incorporate our results into the clustering models of dark matter
halos at any redshift, including those hosting early generations of stars and
galaxies before reionization.

solely by effect of the induced mass. This effect might be relevant for the
development of optic filters based on mechanical stretching of graphene flakes.

in the literature, giving rise to increasingly complicated 2nd order regularity
conditions. However, such conditions are really difficult to be checked for
real data. Especially it is difficult or impossible to check such conditions
using small samples. Beside that most of those conditions suffer from the
drawback of a potentially singular integral representations. However, we can
have various orders of approximation by normal distributions, e.g. Berry-Essen
Types and Edgeworth types. In this paper we indicate that for Berry-Essen Types
of normal approximation and related asymptotic normality of generalized Hill
estimators, we do not necessarily need 2nd order regularity conditions and we
can apply only Karamata's representation for regularly varying tails. 2nd order
regularity conditions however better relates to Edgeworth types of normal
approximations, albeit requiring larger data samples for their proper check.
Finally both expansions are prone for bootstrap and other subsampling
techniques. All existing results indicate that proper representation of tail
behavior play a special and somewhat intriguing role in that context. We dispel
that widespread opinion by providing a full characterization and
representation, in a general regular variation context, of the integral
singularity phenomenon, highlighting its relation to an asymptotical normality
of the Generalized Hill estimator without the 2nd order condition. Thus
application of this new methodology is simple and much more flexible, optimal
for real data sets. Alternative and powerful versions of the Hill plot are also
introduced and illustrated on ecological data of snow extremes from Slovakia.

electronic medical record databases and electronic registries opens tremendous
opportunities for enhancing medical research. For example, controlled trials
are ubiquitously used to investigate the effect of a medical treatment, perhaps
dependent on a set of patient covariates, and traditional approaches have
relied primarily on randomized patient sampling and allocation to treatment and
control group. However, when covariate data for a large cohort group of
patients have already been collected and are available in a database, one can
potentially design a treatment/control sample and allocation that provides far
better estimates of the covariate-dependent effects of the treatment. In this
paper, we develop a new approach that uses optimal design of experiments (DOE)
concepts to accomplish this objective. The approach selects the patients for
the treatment and control samples upfront, based on their covariate values, in
a manner that optimizes the information content in the data. For the optimal
sample selection, we develop simple guidelines and an optimization algorithm
that provides solutions that are substantially better than random sampling.
Moreover, our approach causes no sampling bias in the estimated effects, for
the same reason that DOE principles do not bias estimated effects. We test our
method with a simulation study based on a testbed data set containing
information on the effect of statins on low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol.

an increased flutter speed, vibration frequency, averaged electric power and

speed and the energy harvesting power. For a resonant RL circuit, by tuning the
inductance to match the circuit frequency to the flag's vibration frequency,
the flutter speed can be greatly decreased, and a larger averaged power and

$dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta$, and midrapidity transverse-energy distributions,
$dE_T/d\eta$, are presented for a variety of collision systems and energies.
Included are distributions for Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$,
130, 62.4, 39, 27, 19.6, 14.5, and 7.7 GeV, Cu$+$Cu collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ and 62.4 GeV, Cu$+$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV, U$+$U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=193$ GeV,
$d$$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV, $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV, and $p$$+$$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$
GeV. Centrality-dependent distributions at midrapidity are presented in terms
of the number of nucleon participants, $N_{\rm part}$, and the number of
constituent quark participants, $N_{q{\rm p}}$. For all $A$$+$$A$ collisions
down to $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=7.7$ GeV, it is observed that the midrapidity data
are better described by scaling with $N_{q{\rm p}}$ than scaling with $N_{\rm
part}$. Also presented are estimates of the Bjorken energy density,
$\varepsilon_{\rm BJ}$, and the ratio of $dE_T/d\eta$ to $dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta$,
the latter of which is seen to be constant as a function of centrality for all
systems.

applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. Prior work has studied
this problem using algebraic, iterative, statistical, low-rank and sparse
representation techniques. While these methods have been applied to both linear
and affine subspaces, theoretical results have only been established in the
case of linear subspaces. For example, algebraic subspace clustering (ASC) is
guaranteed to provide the correct clustering when the data points are in
general position and the union of subspaces is transversal. In this paper we
study in a rigorous fashion the properties of ASC in the case of affine
subspaces. Using notions from algebraic geometry, we prove that the
homogenization trick, which embeds points in a union of affine subspaces into
points in a union of linear subspaces, preserves the general position of the
points and the transversality of the union of subspaces in the embedded space,
thus establishing the correctness of ASC for affine subpaces.

a closed-form expression for the Hall-Littlewood index and the Macdonald index
for odd $N$. From the index, we argue that certain short-multiplet which can

that most poker games can be solved as a pattern matching problem, and propose
creating a strong poker playing system based on a unified poker representation.
Our poker player learns through iterative self-play, and improves its
understanding of the game by training on the results of its previous actions
without sophisticated domain knowledge. We evaluate our system on three poker
games: single player video poker, two-player Limit Texas Hold'em, and finally
two-player 2-7 triple draw poker. We show that our model can quickly learn
patterns in these very different poker games while it improves from zero
knowledge to a competitive player against human experts.
  The contributions of this paper include: (1) a novel representation for poker
games, extendable to different poker variations, (2) a CNN based learning model
that can effectively learn the patterns in three different games, and (3) a
self-trained system that significantly beats the heuristic-based program on
which it is trained, and our system is competitive against human expert
players.

FLRW flat cosmological models in which the vacuum energy depends on redshift. A
particularly well motivated model of this type is the so-called quantum field
vacuum, in which apart from a leading constant term $\Lambda_0$ there is also a
$H^{2}$-dependence in the functional form of vacuum, namely
$\Lambda(H)=\Lambda_{0}+3\nu (H^{2}-H^{2}_{0})$. Since $|\nu|\ll1$ this form
endows the vacuum energy of a mild dynamics which affects the evolution of the
main cosmological observables at the background and perturbation levels.
Specifically, at the perturbation level we find that the growth index of the
running vacuum cosmological model is $\gamma_{\Lambda_{H}} \approx
\frac{6+3\nu}{11-12\nu}$ and thus it nicely extends analytically the result of
the $\Lambda$CDM model, $\gamma_{\Lambda}\approx 6/11$.

large gluon flux, these corrections provide distinct and, potentially, the
dominant part of the N$^3$LO QCD contributions to Z-pair production in proton
collisions. The $gg \to ZZ$ annihilation is a loop-induced process that
receives the dominant contribution from loops of five light quarks, that are
included in our computation in the massless approximation. We find that QCD
corrections increase the $gg \to ZZ$ production cross section by ${\cal
O}(50\%-100\%)$ depending on the values of the renormalization and
factorization scales used in the leading order computation, and the collider
energy. The large corrections to $gg \to ZZ$ channel increase the $pp \to ZZ$

that constitutes a fundamental tenet of contemporary cosmology. CMB space based
missions, WMAP and Planck have observed a $7\%$ departure in the SI temperature
field at large angular scales. However, due to higher cosmic variance at low
multipoles, the significance of this measurement is not expected to improve
from any future CMB temperature measurements. We demonstrate that weak lensing
of the CMB due to scalar perturbations produce a corresponding SI violation in
$B$ modes of CMB polarization at smaller angular scales. Measurability of this
phenomenon depends upon the scales ($l$ range) over which power asymmetry is
present. Power asymmetry which is restricted only to $l<64$ in temperature
field cannot lead to any significant observable effect from this new window.
However, this effect can put an independent bound on the spatial range of
scales of hemispherical asymmetry present in scalar sector.

the interference of matter waves to quantum degeneracy of identical particles.
Despite its importance, estimating and measuring quantum coherence in generic,
mixed many-body quantum states remains a formidable challenge, with fundamental
implications in areas as broad as quantum condensed matter, quantum
information, quantum metrology and quantum biology. Here we provide a
quantitative definition of the variance of quantum coherent fluctuations (the
quantum variance) of any observable on generic quantum states. The quantum
variance generalizes the concept of thermal de Broglie wavelength (for the
position of a free quantum particle) to the space of eigenvalues of any
observable, quantifying the degree of coherent delocalization in that space.
The quantum variance is generically measurable and computable as the difference
between the static fluctuations and the static susceptibility of the
observable; despite its simplicity, it is found to provide a tight lower bound
to most widely accepted estimators of ""quantumness"" of observables (both as a
feature as well as a resource), such as the Wigner-Yanase skew information and
the quantum Fisher information. When considering bipartite fluctuations in an
extended quantum system, the quantum variance expresses genuine quantum
correlations (of discord type) among the two parts. In the case of many-body
systems it is found to obey an area law at finite temperature, extending
therefore area laws of entanglement and quantum fluctuations of pure states to
the mixed-state context. Hence the quantum variance paves the way to the
measurement of macroscopic quantum coherence and quantum correlations in most
complex quantum systems.

bar region ($Q_{\rm b}$) as a measure of the bar induced perturbation strength
for a sample of $\sim 600$ barred galaxies. Bars are also characterized from
the maximum of the normalized m=2 Fourier density amplitude ($A_{2}^{\rm max}$)
and the bar maximum isophotal ellipticity ($\varepsilon$). Combining our force
calculations with the HI kinematics from the literature we get an estimate of
the halo-to-stellar mass ratios ($M_{\rm h}/M_{\ast}$) within the optical disk,
which are in good agreement with studies based on weak lensing analysis,
abundance matching and halo occupation distribution methods. By further using
the Universal Rotation Curve models we obtain a first-order model of the
rotation curve decomposition of $1128$ disk galaxies. We find that the dilution
of $Q_{\rm b}$ by the halo becomes important for later types, implying $\sim
20-25\%$ reduction for $T = 7-10$. Whether the halo correction is included or
not, the mean $Q_{\rm b}$ shows an increasing trend with $T$. Late-type bars
are longer than previously found in the literature. We find possible evidence
for the growth of bars within a Hubble time, as (1) bars in early-type galaxies
show larger density amplitudes and disk-relative sizes than their
intermediate-type counterparts, and (2) long bars are typically strong. We also
observe two clearly distinct types of bars, between early and intermediate-type
galaxies ($T<5$) on one side, and the late-type systems on the other, based on
the differences in the bar properties. Most likely this distinction is
connected to the larger halo-to-stellar ratio that we observe in later types,
affecting the disk stability properties (Abridged).

disks use the so-called radial Stokes parameters Q_phi and U_phi to discuss the
results. This approach has the advantage of providing a direct measure of the
noise in the polarized images under the assumption that the polarization is
azimuthal only, i.e., perpendicular to the direction towards the illuminating
source. However, a detailed study of the validity of this assumption is
currently missing. We aim to test whether departures from azimuthal
polarization can naturally be produced by scattering processes in optically
thick protoplanetary disks at near infrared wavelengths. We use the radiative
transfer code MCFOST to create a generic model of a transition disk using
different grain size distributions and dust masses. From these models we
generate synthetic polarized images at 2.2\mum. We find that even for moderate
inclinations (e.g., i = 40degr), multiple scattering alone can produce
significant (up to ~4.5% of the Q_phi image) non-azimuthal polarization
reflected in the U_phi images. We also find that different grain populations
can naturally produce radial polarization (negative values in the Q_phi
images). Our results suggest that caution is recommended when interpreting
polarized images by only analyzing the Q_phi and U_phi images. We find that
there can be astrophysical signal in the U_phi images and negative values in
the Q_phi images, which indicate departures from azimuthal polarization. If
significant signal is detected in the U_phi images, we recommend to check the
standard Q and U images to look for departures from azimuthal polarization. On
the positive side, signal in the U_phi images once all instrumental and
data-reduction artifacts have been corrected for means that there is more
information to be extracted regarding the dust population and particle density.

directional spin scale-discretised wavelets are likely to be of use in a wide
range of applications and in particular for the analysis of the polarisation of

signals in three dimensions. Spin flaglets can probe signal content localized
simultaneously in space and frequency and, moreover, are separable so that
their angular and radial properties can be controlled independently. They are
particularly suited to analyzing of cosmological observations such as the weak
gravitational lensing of galaxies. Such observations have a unique 3D
geometrical setting since they are natively made on the sky, have spin angular
symmetries, and are extended in the radial direction by additional distance or
redshift information. Flaglets are constructed in the harmonic space defined by
the Fourier-Laguerre transform, previously defined for scalar functions and
extended here to signals with spin symmetries. Thanks to various sampling
theorems, both the Fourier-Laguerre and flaglet transforms are theoretically
exact when applied to bandlimited signals. In other words, in numerical
computations the only loss of information is due to the finite representation
of floating point numbers. We develop a 3D framework relating the weak lensing
power spectrum to covariances of flaglet coefficients. We suggest that the
resulting novel flaglet weak lensing estimator offers a powerful alternative to
common 2D and 3D approaches to accurately capture cosmological information.
While standard weak lensing analyses focus on either real or harmonic space
representations (i.e., correlation functions or Fourier-Bessel power spectra,
respectively), a wavelet approach inherits the advantages of both techniques,
where both complicated sky coverage and uncertainties associated with the
physical modeling of small scales can be handled effectively. Our codes to

three-dimensional interstellar dust extinction. We introduce a novel framework
for analyzing the importance of small-scale structure in the extinction. This
formalism demonstrates that the spatially-complex effect of extinction on the
selection function of a pencil-beam or contiguous sky survey is equivalent to a
low-pass filtering of the extinction-affected selection function with the
smooth density field. We find that the angular resolution of current 3D
extinction maps is sufficient for analyzing Gaia sub-samples of millions of

improved by an order of magnitude, especially in the inner Galaxy. We also
present a practical and efficient method for properly taking the effect of
extinction into account in analyses of Galactic structure through an effective
selection function. We illustrate its use with the selection function of
red-clump stars in APOGEE using and comparing a variety of current 3D

by fitting Sersic functions simultaneously to imaging in nine optical and
near-infrared bands. To quantify the wavelength dependence of effective radius
we use the ratio, $\mathcal{R}$, of measurements in two restframe bands. The
dependence of Sersic index on wavelength, $\mathcal{N}$, is computed
correspondingly. Vulcani et al. (2014) have demonstrated that different galaxy
populations present sharply contrasting behaviour in terms of $\mathcal{R}$ and
$\mathcal{N}$. Here we study the luminosity dependence of this result. We find
that at higher luminosities, early-type galaxies display a more substantial
decrease in effective radius with wavelength, whereas late-types present a more
pronounced increase in Sersic index. The structural contrast between types thus
increases with luminosity.
  By considering samples at different redshifts, we demonstrate that lower data
quality reduces the apparent difference between the main galaxy populations.
However, our conclusions remain robust to this effect.
  We show that accounting for different redshift and luminosity selections
partly reconciles the size variation measured by Vulcani et al. with the weaker
trends found by other recent studies. Dividing galaxies by visual morphology
confirms the behaviour inferred using morphological proxies, although the
sample size is greatly reduced.
  Finally, we demonstrate that varying dust opacity and disc inclination can
account for features of the joint distribution of $\mathcal{R}$ and
$\mathcal{N}$ for late-type galaxies. However, dust does not appear to explain
the highest values of $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{N}$. The bulge-disc nature of
galaxies must also contribute to the wavelength-dependence of their structure.

injection index, uniform magnetic field, non-negligible cross-lobe age
variations) may not be as reliable as previously thought. In this paper we use
new VLA observations, which allow spectral curvature at GHz frequencies to be
determined in much greater detail than has previously been possible, to
investigate two cluster-centre radio galaxies, 3C438 and 3C28. We find that for
both sources the injection index is much steeper than the values traditionally
assumed, consistent with our previous findings. We suggest that the Tribble
model of spectral ageing provides the most convincing description when both
goodness-of-fit and physically plausibility are considered, but show that even
with greatly improved coverage at GHz frequencies, a disparity exists in
cluster-centre FR-IIs when spectral ages are compared to those determined from
a dynamical viewpoint. We find for 3C438 that although the observations
indicate the lobes are expanding, its energetics suggest that the radiating
particles and magnetic field at equipartition cannot provide the necessary
pressure to support the lobes, similar to other cluster-centre source such as
Cygnus A. We confirm that small scale, cross-lobe age variations are likely to
be common in FR-II sources and should be properly accounted for when
undertaking spectral ageing studies. Contrary to the assumption of some
previous studies, we also show that 3C28 is an FR-II (rather than FR-I) source,
and suggest that it is most likely a relic system with the central engine being
turned off between 6 and 9 Myrs ago.

Mandelbaum (2015a), we consider two quenching scenarios: 1) a ""halo"" quenching
model in which halo mass is the sole driver for turning off star formation in
both centrals and satellites; and 2) a ""hybrid"" quenching model in which the
quenched fraction of galaxies depends on their stellar mass while the satellite
quenching has an extra dependence on halo mass. The two best-fit models
describe the red galaxy clustering and lensing equally well, but halo quenching
provides significantly better fits to the blue galaxies above $10^{11}
M_\odot/h^2$. The halo quenching model also correctly predicts the average halo
mass of the red and blue centrals, showing excellent agreement with the direct
weak lensing measurements of locally brightest galaxies. Models in which
quenching is not tied to halo mass, including an age-matching model in which
galaxy colour depends on halo age at fixed $M_*$, fail to reproduce the
observed halo mass for massive blue centrals. We find similar critical halo
masses responsible for the quenching of centrals and satellites
(~$1.5\times10^{12} M\odot/h^2$), hinting at a uniform quenching mechanism for
both, e.g., the virial shock-heating of infalling gas. The success of the iHOD
halo quenching model provides strong evidence that the physical mechanism that
quenches star formation in galaxies is tied principally to the masses of their
dark matter halos rather than the properties of their stellar components.

ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) has proven a hindrance in diagnosing the
nature of the accretion flow. The possible association of spectral residuals at
soft energies with atomic features seen in absorption and/or emission and
potentially broadened by velocity dispersion could therefore hold the key to
understanding much about these enigmatic sources. Here we show for the first
time that such residuals are seen in several sources and appear extremely
similar in shape, implying a common origin. Via simple arguments we assert that
emission from extreme colliding winds, absorption in a shell of material
associated with the ULX nebula and thermal plasma emission associated with star
formation are all highly unlikely to provide an origin. Whilst CCD spectra lack
the energy resolution necessary to directly determine the nature of the
features (i.e. formed of a complex of narrow lines or intrinsically broad),
studying the evolution of the residuals with underlying spectral shape allows
for an important, indirect test for their origin. The ULX NGC 1313 X-1 provides
the best opportunity to perform such a test due to the dynamic range in
spectral hardness provided by archival observations. We show through highly
simplified spectral modelling that the strength of the features (in either
absorption or emission) appears to anti-correlate with spectral hardness, which
would rule out an origin via reflection of a primary continuum and instead
supports a picture of atomic transitions in a wind or nearby material

constrain the LF down to an absolute magnitude of $M_{UV}=-15.25$, which

within the LHCb acceptance, yielding over 5 trillion such decays during Run 3
of the LHC. Replacing the photon with a kinetically-mixed dark photon, LHCb is
then sensitive to dark photons that decay as $A^{\prime}\!\to e^+e^-$. We
pursue two search strategies in this paper. The displaced strategy takes
advantage of the large Lorentz boost of the dark photon and the excellent
vertex resolution of LHCb, yielding a nearly background-free search when the
$A^{\prime}$ decay vertex is significantly displaced from the proton-proton
primary vertex. The resonant strategy takes advantage of the large event rate
for $D^{*0} \!\to D^0 A^{\prime}$ and the excellent invariant mass resolution
of LHCb, yielding a background-limited search that nevertheless covers a
significant portion of the $A^{\prime}$ parameter space. Both search strategies
rely on the planned upgrade to a triggerless-readout system at LHCb in Run 3,
which will permit identification of low-momentum electron-positron pairs online
during data taking. For dark photon masses below about 100MeV, LHCb can explore
nearly all of the dark photon parameter space between existing

thickness slab, the axial current density is induced by helicity-correlated
standing waves and, as a consequence, is quantized. The quantization is seen in
its stepped-shape dependence on the fermion chemical potential and a
sawtooth-shape dependence on the thickness of the slab. In contrast to a naive
expectation, there is no chiral charge accumulation anywhere in the bulk or at
the boundaries of the semimetal. In the same slab geometry, we also find that a
nonzero chiral chemical potential induces no electric current, as might have
been expected from the chiral magnetic effect. We argue that this outcome is
natural and points to the truly non-static nature of the latter. By taking into

of the processes that took place and are taking place on those worlds. Research
of the Saturnian satellite surfaces has clear implications for Saturn history
and surroundings. In a recent paper, the production of craters on the mid sized
Saturnian satellites by Centaur objects was calculated considering the current
Solar System. We have compared our results with crater counts from Cassini
images and we have noted that the number of observed small craters is less than
our calculated number. In this paper we estimate the age of the surface for
each observed terrain on each mid sized satellite of Saturn. We have noticed
that since there are less observed small craters than calculated (except on
Iapetus), this results in younger ages. This could be the result of efficient
endogenous or exogenous process(es) for erasing small craters and or crater
saturation at those sizes. The size limit from which the observed number of
smaller craters is less than the calculated is different for each satellite,
possibly indicating processes that are unique to each, but other potential
common explanations would be crater saturation and or deposition of E ring
particles. These processes are also suggested by the findings that the smaller
craters are being preferentially removed, and the erasure process is gradual.
On Enceladus, only mid and high latitude plains have remnants of old terrains;
the other regions could be young; the regions near the South Polar Terrain
could be as young as 50 Myr old. On the contrary for Iapetus, all the surface
is old and it notably registers a primordial source of craters. As the crater
size is decreased, it would be perceived to approach saturation until D less
than 2 km craters, where saturation is complete.

(BCG) has been used worldwide to prevent tuberculosis (TB). However, BCG has
shown a very variable efficacy in different trials, showing a wide range of
protection in adults against pulmonary TB. Previous studies indicate that this
failure is related to pre-existing immune response to antigens that are common
to environmental sources of mycobacterial antigens and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. Specifically, two different mechanisms have been hypothesized:
the masking, (previous sensitization confers some level of protection against
TB), and the blocking (previous immune response prevent vaccine taking of a new
TB vaccine), effects. In this work we introduce a series of models to
discriminate between masking and blocking mechanisms and address their relative
likelihood. The application of our models to interpret the results coming from
the BCG-REVAC clinical trials, specifically designed for the study of sources
of efficacy variability yields estimates that are consistent with high levels
of blocking (41% in Manaus -95% C.I. [14%-68%]- and 96% in Salvador -95% C.I.
[52%-100%]-), and no support for masking to play any relevant role in modifying
vaccine efficacy either alone or aside blocking. The quantification of these
effects around a plausible model constitutes a relevant step towards impact
evaluation of novel anti-tuberculosis vaccines, which are susceptible of being
affected by similar effects if applied on individuals previously exposed to
mycobacterial antigens.

split semisimple subalgebra g with respect to which L is an integrable module
with weights in a possibly non-reduced root system S of the same rank as the
root system R of g. Examples include map algebras (maps from an affine scheme
to g, S = R), matrix algebras like sl_n(A) for a unital associative algebra A
(S = R = A_{n-1}), finite-dimensional isotropic central-simple Lie algebras (S
properly contains R in general), and some equivariant map algebras.
  In this paper we study the category of representations of a root-graded Lie
algebra L which are integrable as representations of g and whose weights are
bounded by some dominant weight of g. We link this category to the module
category of an associative algebra, whose structure we determine for map
algebras and sl_n(A). Our results unify previous work of Chari and her
collaborators on map algebras and of Seligman on isotropic Lie algebras.

identify a class $DGK_{\omega}^{\mathbb{T}}(M)$ of $\mathbb{T}$-invariant
generalized K\""ahler structures for which a generalisation the Abreu-Guillemin
theory of toric K\""ahler metrics holds. Specifically, elements of
$DGK_{\omega}^{\mathbb{T}}(M)$ are characterized by the data of a strictly
convex function $\tau$ on the moment polytope associated to $(M,\omega,
\mathbb{T})$ via the Delzant theorem, and an antisymmetric matrix $C$. For a
given $C$, it is shown that a toric K\""ahler structure on $M$ can be explicitly
deformed to a non-K\""ahler element of $DGK_{\omega}^{\mathbb{T}}(M)$ by adding
a small multiple of $C$. This constitutes an explicit realization of a recent
unobstructedness theorem of R. Goto, where the choice of a matrix $C$
corresponds to choosing a holomorphic Poisson structure. Adapting methods from
S. K. Donaldson, we compute the moment map for the action of
$\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega)$ on $DGK_{\omega}^{\mathbb{T}}(M)$. The result
introduces a natural notion of ""generalized Hermitian scalar curvature"". In
dimension 4, we find an expression for this generalized Hermitian scalar
curvature in terms of the underlying bi-Hermitian structure in the sense of
Apostolov-Gauduchon-Grantcharov.

transition at a critical random field strength $h_c \sim 8.5\pm 0.5$, where all
energy eigenstates are localized beyond that value. Interestingly, the
entanglement entropy and fluctuation of the bipartite magnetization show
distinct probability distributions which characterize different quantum phases.
Furthermore, we show that for weaker $h$, energy eigenstates with higher energy
density are delocalized while states at lower energy density are localized.
This defines a mobility edge and a mobility gap separating these two phases. By
following the evolution of low energy eigenstates, we observe that the mobility
gap grows with increasing the random field strength, which drives the system to
the phase of the full many-body localization with increasing disorder strength.

formulate the resource allocation problem mathematically as an Integer Linear

is often referred as galaxy alignment. To understand the origin of galaxy
alignments on small scales, one must investigate how galaxies were accreted in
the early universe and quantify their primordial anisotropic at the time of
accretion. In this paper we use N-body simulations to investigate the accretion
of dark matter subhaloes, focusing on their alignment with the host halo shape
and the orientation of mass distribution on large scale, defined using the
hessian matrix of the density field. The large/small (e1/e3) eigenvalues of the
hessian matrix define the fast/slow collapse direction of dark matter on large
scale. We find that: 1) the halo major axis is well aligned with the e3 (slow
collapse) direction, and it is stronger for massive haloes; 2) subhaloes are
predominately accreted along the major axis of the host halo, and the alignment
increases with the host halo mass. Most importantly, this alignment is
universal; 3) accretion of subhaloes with respect to the e3 direction is not
universal. In massive haloes, subhaloes are accreted along the e3 (even
stronger than the alignment with the halo major axis), but in low-mass haloes
subhaloes are accreted perpendicular to the e3. The transit mass is lower at
high redshift. The last result well explains the puzzled correlation (both in
recent observations and simulations) that massive galaxies/haloes have their
spin perpendicular to the filament, and the spin of low-mass galaxies/haloes is
slightly aligned with the filament, under the assumption that the orbital
angular momentum of subhaloes is converted to halo spin.

recurring issue in many applications. Significant amounts of effort have been
devoted to developing weakly supervised methods tailored to each individual
setting, which are often carefully designed to take advantage of the particular
properties of weak supervision regimes, form of available data and prior
knowledge of the task at hand. Unfortunately, it is difficult to adapt these
methods to new tasks and/or forms of data, which often require different weak
supervision regimes or models. We present a general-purpose method that can
solve any weakly supervised learning problem irrespective of the weak
supervision regime or the model. The proposed method turns any off-the-shelf
strongly supervised classifier into a weakly supervised classifier and allows
the user to specify any arbitrary weakly supervision regime via a loss
function. We apply the method to several different weak supervision regimes and
demonstrate competitive results compared to methods specifically engineered for
those settings.

Recent observations indicate the presence of high and thick clouds or haze
whose presence requires strong atmospheric mixing. In order to understand the
transport and distribution of such clouds/haze, we study the atmospheric
circulation and the vertical mixing of GJ1214b with a 3D General Circulation
Model for cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres (metallicity of 1, 10 and
100 times the solar value) and for a water-dominated atmosphere. We analyze the
effect of the atmospheric metallicity on the thermal structure and zonal winds.
We also analyze the zonal mean meridional circulation and show that it
corresponds to an anti-Hadley circulation in most of the atmosphere with
upwelling at mid-latitude and downwelling at the equator in average. This
circulation must be present on a large range of synchronously rotating
exoplanets with strong impact on cloud formation and distribution. Using simple
tracers, we show that vertical winds on GJ1214b can be strong enough to loft
micrometric particles and that the anti-Hadley circulation leads to a minimum
of tracers at the equator. We find that the strength of the vertical mixing
increases with metallicity. We derive 1D equivalent eddy diffusion coefficients
and find simple parametrizations from Kzz=7x10^2xP_{bar}^{-0.4} m^2/s for solar
metallicity to Kzz=3x10^3xP_{bar}^{-0.4} m^2/s for the 100xsolar metallicity.
These values should favor an efficient formation of photochemical haze in the

labeling grasp locations is not a trivial task; (b) human labeling is biased by

experiments, the amount of data used in such experiments remains substantially
low and hence makes the learner prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we take
the leap of increasing the available training data to 40 times more than prior
work, leading to a dataset size of 50K data points collected over 700 hours of
robot grasping attempts. This allows us to train a Convolutional Neural Network

We seek a local reduced-order model for this kind of multiscale transport

approximations of the solution. We start from a Petrov-Galerkin framework using
optimal weighting functions. We introduce an auxiliary variable to a mixed
formulation of the problem. The auxiliary variable stands for the optimal
weighting function. The problem reduces to finding a test space (a reduced
dimensional space for this auxiliary variable), which guarantees that the error
in the primal variable (representing the solution) is close to the projection
error of the full solution on the reduced dimensional space that approximates
the solution. To find the test space, we reformulate some recent mixed
Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Methods. We introduce snapshots and local
spectral problems that appropriately define local weight and trial spaces. In
particular, we use energy minimizing snapshots and local spectral
decompositions in the natural norm associated with the auxiliary variable. The
resulting spectral decomposition adaptively identifies and builds the optimal
multiscale space to stabilize the system. We discuss the stability and its
relation to the approximation property of the test space. We design online

consequently, improve stability. We present several numerical examples and show

System can be constrained by the obliquities of Jupiter and Saturn. We have
performed secular simulations with imposed migration and N-body simulations
with planetesimals to study the expected obliquity distribution of migrating
planets with initial conditions resembling those of the smooth migration model,
the resonant Nice model and two models with five giant planets initially in
resonance (one compact and one loose configuration). For smooth migration, the
secular spin-orbit resonance mechanism can tilt Saturn's spin axis to the
current obliquity if the product of the migration time scale and the orbital
inclinations is sufficiently large (exceeding 30 Myr deg). For the resonant
Nice model with imposed migration, it is difficult to reproduce today's
obliquity values, because the compactness of the initial system raises the
frequency that tilts Saturn above the spin precession frequency of Jupiter,
causing a Jupiter spin-orbit resonance crossing. Migration time scales
sufficiently long to tilt Saturn generally suffice to tilt Jupiter more than is
observed. The full N-body simulations tell a somewhat different story, with
Jupiter generally being tilted as often as Saturn, but on average having a
higher obliquity. The main obstacle is the final orbital spacing of the giant
planets, coupled with the tail of Neptune's migration. The resonant Nice case
is barely able to simultaneously reproduce the {orbital and spin} properties of
the giant planets, with a probability ~0.15%. The loose five planet model is
unable to match all our constraints (probability <0.08%). The compact five
planet model has the highest chance of matching the orbital and obliquity
constraints simultaneously (probability ~0.3%).

solving the Lippmann- Schwinger equation and are projected onto the valley
state subspaces to obtain the valley velocity fields and total valley currents
in the nanostructures. In the tunneling regime when the Fermi energy is in the
spectral gap around the Dirac point energy, inversion symmetry breaking is
found to result in strong enhancement of the nonlocal 4 terminal
Buttiker-Landauer resistance and in valley currents several times stronger than
the conventional electric current. These strong valley currents are the direct
result of the injection of electrons from a contact into the graphene in the
tunneling regime. They are chiral and occur near contacts from which electrons
are injected into the nanostructure whether or not a net electric current flows
through the contact. It is also pointed out that enhanced non-local resistances
in the linear response regime are not a signature of valley currents arising
from the combined effect of the electric field and Berry curvature on the

applications is to meet the stringent timing and reliability requirements of

delay and packet errors, and limited battery resources of the sensor nodes.
Since the transmission delay and energy consumption of a sensor node are
determined by the transmission power and rate of that sensor node and the
concurrently transmitting nodes, the transmission schedule should be optimized
jointly with the transmission power and rate of the sensor nodes. Previously,
it has been shown that the optimization of power control and rate adaptation
for each node subset can be separately formulated, solved and then used in the
scheduling algorithm in the optimal solution of the joint optimization of power
control, rate adaptation and scheduling problem. However, the power control and
rate adaptation problem has been only formulated and solved for continuous rate
transmission model, in which Shannon's capacity formulation for an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) wireless channel is used in the calculation of the
maximum achievable rate as a function of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise
Ratio (SINR). In this paper, we formulate the power control and rate adaptation
problem with the objective of minimizing the time required for the concurrent
transmission of a set of sensor nodes while satisfying their transmission
delay, reliability and energy consumption requirements based on the more
realistic discrete rate transmission model, in which only a finite set of
transmit rates are supported. We propose a polynomial time algorithm to solve
this problem and prove the optimality of the proposed algorithm. We then
combine it with the previously proposed scheduling algorithms and demonstrate
its close to optimal performance via extensive simulations.

an embedded program environment under diverse hardware resource conditions.
Owing to the diverse hardware components used to build numerous TV models, TV
simulators are usually not high enough in fidelity to simulate various TV
models, and thus are only regarded as unreliable alternatives when stress
testing such applications. Therefore, even though stress testing on real TV
sets is tedious, it is the de facto approach to ensure the reliability of these
applications in the industry. In this paper, we study to what extent stress
testing of smart TV applications can be fully automated in the industrial
environments. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has addressed this
important question. We summarize the find-ings collected from 10 industrial
test engineers to have tested 20 such TV applications in a real production
environment. Our study shows that the industry required test automation
supports on high-level GUI object controls and status checking, setup of
resource conditions and the interplay between the two. With such supports, 87%
of the industrial test specifications of one TV model can be fully automated
and 71.4% of them were found to be fully reusable to test a subsequent TV model
with major up-grades of hardware, operating system and application. It
repre-sents a significant improvement with margins of 28% and 38%,
respectively, compared to stress testing without such supports.

the Tomonaga-Luttinger model. In particular, we focus on the role of the
momentum-dependence of the two-particle interaction V(q). Usually, V(q) is
assumed to be a constant and integrals are regularized in the ultraviolet `by
hand' employing an ad hoc procedure. As the momentum dependence of the
interaction is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense this does not
affect the universal low-energy properties of the model, e.g. exponents of
power laws, if all energy scales are sent to zero. If, however, the momentum k
is fixed away from the Fermi momentum k_F, with |k-k_F| setting a nonvanishing
energy scale, the details of V(q) start to matter. We provide strong evidence
that any curvature of the two-particle interaction at small transferred
momentum q destroys power-law scaling of the momentum resolved spectral
function as a function of energy. Even for |k-k_F| much smaller than the
momentum space range of the interaction the spectral line shape depends on the
details of V(q). The significance of our results for universality in the

for recent attempts to compute the spectral function of one-dimensional

based on maximum likelihood (ML) can be used to align the images and verify the
presence of signal in the picked particles. Although the paradigm of this
dual-target-function (DTF) evaluation of single-particle selection has been
practiced in recent years, it remains unclear how the performance of this DTF
approach is affected by the signal-to-noise ratio of the images and by the
choice of references for FLC and ML. Here we examine this problem through a
systematic study of simulated data, followed by experimental substantiation. We
quantitatively pinpoint the critical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), at which the
DTF approach starts losing its ability to select and verify particles from
cryo-EM micrographs. A Gaussian model is shown to be as effective in picking
particles as a single projection view of the imaged molecule in the tested
cases. For both simulated micrographs and real cryo-EM data of the 173-kDa
glucose isomerase complex, we found that the use of a Gaussian model to
initialize the target functions suppressed the detrimental effect of reference
bias in template-based particle selection. Given a sufficient signal-to-noise
ratio in the images and the appropriate choice of references, the DTF approach
can expedite the automated assembly of single-particle data sets.

using an approach based on cycles of Mo evaporation and sulfurization to first
nucleate the MoS$_2$ nano-islands and then gradually increase their size.
During this growth process the native herringbone reconstruction of Au(111) is
lifted as shown by low energy electron diffraction measurements. Within these
MoS$_2$ islands, we identify domains rotated by 60$^{\circ}$ that lead to
atomically sharp line defects at domain boundaries. As the MoS$_2$ coverage
approaches the limit of a complete single-layer, the formation of bilayer
MoS$_2$ islands is initiated. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
measurements of both single and bilayer MoS$_2$ samples show a dramatic change
in their band structure around the center of the Brillouin zone. Brief exposure
to air after removing the MoS$_2$ layer from vacuum is not found to affect its

of the resulting construction are many. The first one is that it gives a quasi
equilibrium description on how glassy systems explore the phase space in the
slow relaxation part of their dynamics. The second one is that it gives an
alternative way to obtain dynamical equations starting from a dynamical rule
that is static in spirit. This provides a way to overcome the difficulties
encountered in the short time part of the dynamics where current conservation
must be enforced. We study this approach in detail in a prototypical mean field
disordered spin system, namely the p-spin spherical model, showing how we can
obtain the well known equations that describes its dynamics. Then we apply the
same approach to structural glasses. We first derive a set of dynamical
Ornstein-Zernike equations which are very general in nature. Finally we
consider two possible closure schemes for them, namely the Hypernetted Chain
approximation of liquid theory and a closure of the BBGKY hierarchy that has
been recently introduced by G. Szamel. From both approaches we finally find a
set of dynamical Mode-Coupling like equations that are supposed to describe the
system in the long time/slow dynamics regime.

gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), we for the first time evaluate the feasibility of
rapid EM follow-ups to capture the prompt emission, early engine activity or
reveal any potential by-products such as magnetars or fast radio bursts. To
achieve our goal, we first simulate a population of coalescing BNSs using
realistic distributions of source parameters and estimate the detectability and
localisation efficiency at different times before merger. We then use a
selection of facilities with GW follow-up agreements in place, from
low-frequency radio to high energy $\gamma$-ray to assess the prospects of
prompt follow-up. We quantify our assessment using observational SGRB flux data
extrapolated to be within the horizon distances of the advanced GW
interferometric detectors LIGO and Virgo and to the prompt phase immediately
following the binary merger. Our results illustrate that while challenging,
breakthrough multi-messenger science is possible with EM follow-up facilities
with fast responses and wide fields-of-view. We demonstrate that the
opportunity to catch the prompt stage ($<$ 5s) of SGRBs, can be enhanced by
speeding up the detection pipelines of both GW observatories and EM follow-up

adiabatically to the infall of baryons, we have constructed a self-consistent
dynamical model of the Galaxy that satisfies a large number of observations,
including measurements of gas terminal velocities and masers, the kinematics of
a 180,000 giant stars from the RAVE survey, and star count data from the SDSS.
The stellar disc and the dark halo are both specified by distribution functions
(DFs) of the action integrals. The model is obtained by extending the work of
Piffl Penoyre & Binney (2015} from the construction of a single model to a
systematic search of model space. Whereas the model of Piffl et al violated
constraints on the terminal-velocity curve, our model respects these
constraints by adopting a long scale length R_d=3.66 kpc for the thin and thick
discs. The model is, however, inconsistent with the measured optical depth for
microlensing of bulge stars because it attributes too large a fraction of the
density at R <~ 3 kpc to dark matter rather than stars. Moreover, it now seems
likely that the thick disc's scale-length is significantly shorter than the
model implies. Shortening this scale-length would cause the constraints from
the rotation curve to be violated anew. We conclude that we can now rule out
adiabatic compression of our Galaxy's dark halo.

Moreover, any hypercube variant of dimension $n$ is an n-regular graph on $2^n$
vertices, and hence has diameter greater than $n/\log_2 n$. So the Z-cubes are
optimal with respect to diameters, up to an error of order $o(n/\log_2n)$.

transient faults in presence of radiation and other environmental hazards
compared to Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Hence, error
mitigation and recovery techniques are absolutely necessary to protect the FPGA
hardware from soft errors arising due to such transient faults. In this paper,
a new efficient multi-bit error correcting method for FPGAs is proposed using
adaptive cross parity check (ACPC) code. ACPC is easy to implement and the
needed decoding circuit is also simple. In the proposed scheme total
configuration memory is partitioned into two parts. One part will contain ACPC
hardware, which is static and assumed to be unaffected by any kind of errors.
Other portion will store the binary file for logic, which is to be protected
from transient error and is assumed to be dynamically reconfigurable (Partial
reconfigurable area). Binary file from the secondary memory passes through ACPC
hardware and the bits for forward error correction (FEC) field are calculated
before entering into the reconfigurable portion. In the runtime scenario, the
data from the dynamically reconfigurable portion of the configuration memory
will be read back and passed through the ACPC hardware. The ACPC hardware will
correct the errors before the data enters into the dynamic configuration
memory. We propose a first of its kind methodology for novel transient fault
correction using ACPC code for FPGAs. To validate the design we have tested the
proposed methodology with Kintex FPGA. We have also measured different
parameters like critical path, power consumption, overhead resource and error
correction efficiency to estimate the performance of our proposed method.

several years. A number of recent papers introduced efficient algorithms for
the estimation of spreading parameters, based on the maximization of the
likelihood of observed cascades, assuming that the full information for all the
nodes in the network is available. In this work, we focus on a more realistic
and restricted scenario, in which only a partial information on the cascades is
available: either the set of activation times for a limited number of nodes, or
the states of nodes for a subset of observation times. To tackle this problem,
we first introduce a framework based on the maximization of the likelihood of
the incomplete diffusion trace. However, we argue that the computation of this
incomplete likelihood is a computationally hard problem, and show that a fast
and robust reconstruction of transmission probabilities in sparse networks can
be achieved with a new algorithm based on recently introduced dynamic
message-passing equations for the spreading processes. The suggested approach
can be easily generalized to a large class of discrete and continuous dynamic
models, as well as to the cases of dynamically-changing networks and noisy
information.

parameter shifts from the Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON) over
the past 22 years, up to the end of 2014. We aim to demonstrate that they are
not dominated by changes in the asymmetry of the resonant peak profiles of the
modes and that the previously published results on the solar-cycle variations
of mode parameters are reliable. We compare the results obtained using a
conventional maximum likelihood estimation algorithm and a new one based on the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, both taking into account mode
asymmetry. We assess the reliability of the solar-cycle trends seen in the data
by applying the same analysis to artificially generated spectra. We find that
the two methods are in good agreement. Both methods accurately reproduce the
input frequency shifts in the artificial data and underestimate the amplitude
and width changes by a small amount, around 10 per cent. We confirm earlier
findings that the frequency and line width are positively correlated, and the
mode amplitude anticorrelated, with the level of solar activity, with the
energy supplied to the modes remaining essentially unchanged. For the mode
asymmetry the correlation with activity is marginal, but the MCMC algorithm
gives more robust results than the MLE. The magnitude of the parameter shifts
is consistent with earlier work. There is no evidence that the frequency
changes we see arise from changes in the asymmetry, which would need to be much
larger than those observed in order to give the observed frequency shift.

in the present simulations. Fast magnetic reconnection then develops as a
consequence of the plasmoid instability without the need to invoke anomalous
resistivity enhancements. Multiple levels of the instability are followed as it
cascades to smaller scales, which approach the ion inertial length. The
reconnection rate, normalized to the asymptotic values of magnetic field and
Alfv\'en velocity in the inflow region, reaches values in the range
$\sim0.01\mbox{--}0.03$ throughout the cascading plasmoid formation and for
zero as well as for strong guide field. The out-flow velocity reaches
$\approx40$~km\,s$^{-1}$. Slow-mode shocks extend from the $X$-points, heating
the plasmoids up to $\sim 8\times10^4$~K. In the case of zero guide field, the
inclusion of ambipolar diffusion and radiative cooling both cause a rapid
thinning of the current sheet (down to $\sim30$~m) and early formation of
secondary islands. Both of these processes have very little effect on the
plasmoid instability for a strong guide field. The reconnection rates,
temperature enhancements, and upward out-flow velocities from the vertical
current sheet correspond well to their characteristic values in chromospheric

spatially resolved view of an external star-forming galaxy in gamma-rays. The
LMC was detected at 0.1-100GeV as an extended source with CGRO/EGRET and using
early observations with the Fermi-LAT. The emission was found to correlate with
massive star-forming regions and to be particularly bright towards 30 Doradus.
Studies of the origin and transport of cosmic rays (CRs) in the Milky Way are
frequently hampered by line-of-sight confusion and poor distance determination.
The LMC offers a complementary way to address these questions by revealing
whether and how the gamma-ray emission is connected to specific objects,
populations of objects, and structures in the galaxy. We revisited the
gamma-ray emission from the LMC using about 73 months of Fermi-LAT P7REP data
in the 0.2-100GeV range. We developed a complete spatial and spectral model of
the LMC emission, for which we tested several approaches: a simple geometrical
description, template-fitting, and a physically driven model for CR-induced
interstellar emission. In addition to identifying PSR J0540-6919 through its
pulsations, we find two hard sources positionally coincident with plerion N
157B and supernova remnant N 132D, which were also detected at TeV energies
with H.E.S.S. We detect an additional soft source that is currently
unidentified. Extended emission dominates the total flux from the LMC. It
consists of an extended component of about the size of the galaxy and
additional emission from 3 to 4 regions with degree-scale sizes. If it is
interpreted as CRs interacting with interstellar gas, the large-scale emission
implies a large-scale population of ~1-100GeV CRs with a density of ~30% of the
local Galactic value. On top of that, the 3 to 4 small-scale emission regions
would correspond to enhancements of the CR density by factors 2 to 6 or higher

\muSR spectra recorded above T_c. At lower temperatures a published analytical
extension of the Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe model provides a good description,

encapsulated bubbles used currently as contrast agents for medical echography,
exhibit complex dynamics under specific acoustic excitations. Nonetheless,
considering their micron size and the complexity of their interaction
phenomenon with ultrasound waves, expensive and complex experiments and/or
simulations are required for their analysis. The behavior of a microbubble
along its equator can be linked to a system of coupled oscillators. In this
study, the oscillatory behavior of a microbubble has been investigated through
an acousto-mechanical analogy based on a ring-shaped chain of coupled pendula.
Observation of parametric vibration modes of the pendula ring excited at
frequencies between $1$ and $5$ Hz is presented. Simulations have been carried
out and show mode mixing phenomena. The relevance of the analogy between a
microbubble and the macroscopic acousto-mechanical setup is discussed and
suggested as an alternative way to investigate the complexity of microbubble
dynamics.

supergravity solution. Employing the relation of M-theory and type IIA string
theory, glueball is also 10D gravitational perturbations which are the excited
modes by close strings in the bulk of this model. On the other hand, baryon is
identified as a D4-brane wrapped on $S^{4}$ which is named as baryon vertex, so
the glueball-baryon interaction is nothing but the close string/baryon vertex
interaction in this model. Since the baryon vertex could be equivalently
treated as the instanton configurations on the flavor brane, we identify the
glueball-baryon interaction as ""graviton-instanton"" interaction in order to
describe it quantitatively by the quantum mechanical system for the collective
modes of baryons. So the effective Hamiltonian can be obtained by considering
the gravitational perturbations in the flavor brane action. With this
Hamiltonian, the amplitudes and the selection rules of the glueball-baryon
interaction can be analytically calculated in the strong coupling limit. We
show our calculations explicitly in two characteristic situations which are
""scalar and tensor glueball interacting with baryons"". Although there is a long

these limitations, this paper develops a general framework for the exact

relay. We first provide analysis to reveal how the throughput capacity of such
a MANET is determined by its relay-buffer blocking probability (RBP). Based on
the Embedded Markov Chain Theory and Queuing Theory, a novel theoretical
framework is then developed to enable the RBP and closed-form expression for
exact throughput capacity to be derived. We further conduct case studies under
two typical transmission scheduling schemes to illustrate the applicability of
our framework and to explore the corresponding capacity optimization as well as
capacity scaling law. Finally, extensive simulation and numerical results are
provided to validate the efficiency of our framework and to show the impacts

the almost purely atomic ISM in distant galaxies. We obtained ALMA observations
of a foreground galaxy at z = 0.89 in the direction of the lensed blazar PKS

absorption along two different lines of sight toward PKS 1830-211, known as the
SW and NE images of the background blazar. The argonium absorption is clearly
enhanced on the more diffuse line of sight (NE) compared to other molecular
species. The isotopic ratio 36Ar/38Ar is 3.46 +- 0.16 toward the SW image,

the suitability of argonium as a tracer of the almost purely atomic, diffuse

They
can be divided into different families according to the relative mass of the
co-orbital partners and the particularities of their movement. Janus and
Epimetheus are unique in that they are the only known co-orbital pair of
comparable masses and thus the only known system in mutual horseshoe orbit.
  Aims: We aim to establish whether the Janus-Epimetheus system might have
formed by disruption of an object in the current orbit of Epimetheus.
  Methods: We assumed that four large main fragments were formed and neglected
smaller fragments. We used numerical integration of the full N-body problem to
study the evolution of different fragment arrangements. Collisions were assumed
to result in perfectly inelastic merging of bodies. We statistically analysed
the outcome of these simulations to infer whether co-orbital systems might have
formed from the chosen initial conditions.
  Results: Depending on the range of initial conditions, up to 9% of the
simulations evolve into co-orbital systems. Initial velocities around the
escape velocity of Janus yield the highest formation probability. Analysis of
the evolution shows that all co-orbital systems are produced via secondary
collisions. The velocity of these collisions needs to be low enough that the
fragments can merge and not be destroyed. Generally, collisions are found to be
faster than an approximate cut-off velocity threshold. However, given a
sufficiently low initial velocity, up to 15% of collisions is expected to
result in merging. Hence, the results of this study show that the considered
formation scenario is viable.

  accepted for the journal Language Resources and Evaluation, Springer",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Swiss avalanche bulletin is produced twice a day in four languages. Due
to the lack of time available for manual translation, a fully automated
translation system is employed, based on a catalogue of predefined phrases and
predetermined rules of how these phrases can be combined to produce sentences.
Because this catalogue of phrases is limited to a small sublanguage, the system
is able to automatically translate such sentences from German into the target
languages French, Italian and English without subsequent proofreading or
correction. Having been operational for two winter seasons, we assess here the
quality of the produced texts based on two different surveys where participants
rated texts from real avalanche bulletins from both origins, the catalogue of
phrases versus manually written and translated texts. With a mean recognition
rate of 55%, users can hardly distinguish between thetwo types of texts, and
give very similar ratings with respect to their language quality. Overall, the
output from the catalogue system can be considered virtually equivalent to a
text written by avalanche forecasters and then manually translated by
professional translators. Furthermore, forecasters declared that all relevant
situations were captured by the system with sufficient accuracy. Forecaster's
working load did not change with the introduction of the catalogue: the extra
time to find matching sentences is compensated by the fact that they no longer
need to double-check manually translated texts. The reduction of daily
translation costs is expected to offset the initial development costs within a
few years.

  Instructions for Use and New Perspectives",,,,,"cs.RO cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The importance of depth perception in the interactions that humans have
within their nearby space is a well established fact. Consequently, it is also
well known that the possibility of exploiting good stereo information would
ease and, in many cases, enable, a large variety of attentional and interactive
behaviors on humanoid robotic platforms. However, the difficulty of computing
real-time and robust binocular disparity maps from moving stereo cameras often
prevents from relying on this kind of cue to visually guide robots' attention
and actions in real-world scenarios. The contribution of this paper is
two-fold: first, we show that the Efficient Large-scale Stereo Matching
algorithm (ELAS) by A. Geiger et al. 2010 for computation of the disparity map
is well suited to be used on a humanoid robotic platform as the iCub robot;
second, we show how, provided with a fast and reliable stereo system,
implementing relatively challenging visual behaviors in natural settings can
require much less effort. As a case of study we consider the common situation
where the robot is asked to focus the attention on one object close in the
scene, showing how a simple but effective disparity-based segmentation solves
the problem in this case. Indeed this example paves the way to a variety of
other similar applications.

cross section (=$\sigma^{cc}$) on iron using data from exposed to the J-PARC

over a range of off-axis angles from 0$^\circ$ to 1.1$^\circ$. The variation in
the neutrino energy spectrum as a function of the off-axis angle, combined with
event topology information, is used to calculate this cross section as a
function of neutrino energy. The cross section is measured to be
$\sigma^{cc}(1.1\text{ GeV}) = 1.10 \pm 0.15$
$(10^{-38}\text{cm}^2/\text{nucleon})$, $\sigma^{cc}(2.0\text{ GeV}) = 2.07 \pm

2.0, and 3.3 GeV, respectively. These results are consistent with the cross
section calculated by the neutrino interaction generators currently used by
T2K. More importantly, the method described here opens up a new way to
determine the energy dependence of neutrino-nucleus cross sections.

acoustic emissions attenuation is proposed. The method capitalizes on
co-detection of elastic waves emanating from micro-cracks by multiple and
spatially separated sensors. Event co-detection is considered as surrogate for
large event size with more frequent co-detected events marking imminence of
catastrophic failure. Using a spatially explicit fiber bundle numerical model
with spatially correlated mechanical strength and two load redistribution
rules, we constructed a range of mechanical failure scenarios and associated
failure events (mapped into AE) in space and time. Analysis considering
hypothetical arrays of sensors and consideration of signal attenuation
demonstrate the potential of the co-detection principles even for insensitive
sensors to provide early warning for imminent global failure.

radiation fields exhibits, during its dynamical evolution, interesting optical
phenomena such as electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and a variety
of nonclassical effects. Signatures of the latter are seen in the entanglement
dynamics of the atomic subsystem and in appropriate field observables. Some of
these effects have been experimentally detected, and have even been used to
change the nonlinear optical properties of certain atomic media. It is
therefore useful to investigate the roles played by specific initial states of
the radiation fields, detuning parameters, field nonlinearities and the nature
of field-atom couplings on EIT and on the entanglement between subsystems. We
investigate these aspects in the framework of a simple model that captures the
salient features of such tripartite entangled systems. Entanglement dynamics is
shown to be very sensitive to the intensity-dependent atom-field couplings.
Unexpected interesting features pertaining to the collapses and revivals of the
atomic subsystem von Neumann entropy appear. These features could, in
principle, be useful in enabling entanglement.

the same age and the same initial composition. The presently observed

Toulouse Geneva Evolution Code (TGEC) that includes complete atomic diffusion
(including radiative accelerations). We compared the predicted surface

mixing process is needed. We then included the effect of accretion-induced
fingering convection. The accretion of planetary matter does not change the
metal abundances but leads to lithium destruction which depends on the accreted
mass. A fraction of earth mass is enough to explain the lithium surface
abundances of 16 Cyg B. We also checked the beryllium abundances. In the case
of accretion of heavy matter onto stellar surfaces, the accreted heavy elements
do not remain in the outer convective zones but they are mixed downwards by
fingering convection induced by the unstable $\mu$-gradient. Depending on the
accreted mass, this mixing process may transport lithium down to its nuclear
destruction layers and lead to an extra lithium depletion at the surface. A
fraction of earth mass is enough to explain a lithium ratio of 4.7 in the 16

frequent in planet host stars and should be studied in other cases in the

experienced by any generic macroscopic object due to the internal field
interacting with its atoms, charges and molecules. Appropriate scenarios are
established for the conservation of a newly proposed momentum that we call
non-mechanical generalized Einstein-Laub momentum, along with the kinetic and
canonical momenta of photons. Our theory remains valid even in a generally
heterogeneous or bounded embedding background medium without resorting to
hidden momenta, and unambiguously identifies the existence domain, or validity
domain, of the STs and photon momenta proposed to date. This existence domain
is the region either outside a macroscopic scatterer with only exterior fields,
or at its interior with only inside fields. The appropriate identification of
such existence domain constitutes the basis of our unified theory. Finally, a
thought experiment is proposed, which shows that the appropriate force and the
photon momentum in the embedding medium can also be properly identified if the
background is comparatively larger than the embedded scatterer. It also

see both types of infection reach infinitely many sites. This has previously
been studied on the $d$-dimensional cubic lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$,

such coexistence has positive probability if and only if $\lambda_1=\lambda_2$.

human movement performance is presently an area of great interest, efforts to
quantify the performance of movement are hampered by the lack of a principled
model that describes how a subject goes about making a movement. We put forward
a principled mathematical formalism that describes human movements using an
optimal control model in which the subject controls the jerk of the movement.
We construct the formalism by assuming that the movement a subject chooses to
make is better than the alternatives. We quantify the relative quality of
movements mathematically by specifying a cost functional that assigns a
numerical value to every possible movement; the subject makes the movement that
minimizes the cost functional. We develop the mathematical structure of
movements that minimize a cost functional, and observe that this development
parallels the development of analytical mechanics from the Principle of Least
Action. We derive a constant of the motion for human movements that plays a
role that is analogous to the role that the energy plays in classical
mechanics. We apply the formalism to the description of two movements: (1)
rapid, targeted movements of a computer mouse, and (2) finger-tapping, and show
that the constant of the motion that we have derived provides a useful value
with which we can characterize the performance of the movements. In the case of
rapid, targeted movements of a computer mouse, we show how the model of human
movement that we have developed can be made to agree with Fitts' law, and we
show how Fitts' law is related to the constant of the motion that we have
derived. We finally show that solutions exist within the model of human
movements that exhibit an oscillatory character reminiscent of tremor.

types thanks to the development of Zeeman-Doppler Imaging. These observations
are extremely useful for constraining rotational evolution models of stars, as
well as for characterizing the generation of magnetic field. We recently
demonstrated that the impact of coronal magnetic field topology on the
rotational braking of a star can be parametrized with a scalar parameter: the
open magnetic flux. However, without running costly numerical simulations of
the stellar wind, reconstructing the coronal structure of the large scale
magnetic field is not trivial. An alternative -broadly used in solar physics-
is to extrapolate the surface magnetic field assuming a potential field in the
corona, to describe the opening of the field lines by the magnetized wind. This
technique relies on the definition of a so-called source surface radius, which
is often fixed to the canonical value of 2.5Rsun. However this value likely
varies from star to star. To resolve this issue, we use our extended set of
2.5D wind simulations published in 2015, to provide a criteria for the opening
of field lines as well as a simple tool to assess the source surface radius and
the open magnetic flux. This allows us to derive the magnetic torque applied to
the star by the wind from any spectropolarimetric observation. We conclude by
discussing some estimations of spin-down time scales made using our technique,
and compare them to observational requirements.

column density distribution of dust. Fits to the model constrain the median
extinction, the width of the extinction distribution, and the fraction of
reddened stars. The resulting extinction map has >4 times better resolution
than maps of dust emission, while providing a more direct measurement of the
dust column. There is superb morphological agreement between the new map and
maps of the extinction inferred from dust emission by Draine et al. 2014.
However, the widely-used Draine & Li (2007) dust models overpredict the
observed extinction by a factor of ~2.5, suggesting that M31's true dust mass
is lower and that dust grains are significantly more emissive than assumed in
Draine et al. (2014). The discrepancy we identify is consistent with similar
findings in the Milky Way by the Planck Collaboration (2015), but has a more
complex dependence on parameters from the Draine & Li (2007) dust models. We

homotopy properties of the horizontal base-point free loop space $\Lambda$,
i.e. the space of absolutely continuous maps $\gamma:S^1\to M$ whose velocities
are constrained to $\Delta$ (for example: legendrian knots in a contact
manifold).
  A key technical ingredient for our study is the proof that the base-point map
$F:\Lambda \to M$ (the map associating to every loop its base-point) is a
Hurewicz fibration for the $W^{1,2}$ topology on $\Lambda$. Using this result
we show that, even if the space $\Lambda$ might have deep singularities (for
example: constant loops form a singular manifold homeomorphic to $M$), its
homotopy can be controlled nicely. In particular we prove that $\Lambda$ (with
the $W^{1,2}$ topology) has the homotopy type of a CW-complex, that its
inclusion in the standard base-point free loop space (i.e. the space of loops
with no non-holonomic constraint) is a homotopy equivalence, and consequently
its homotopy groups can be computed as $\pi_k(\Lambda)\simeq \pi_k(M) \ltimes
\pi_{k+1}(M)$ for all $k\geq 0.$
  These topological results are applied, in the second part of the paper, to
the problem of the existence of closed sub-riemannian geodesics. In the general
case we prove that if $(M, \Delta)$ is a compact sub-riemannian manifold, each
non trivial homotopy class in $\pi_1(M)$ can be represented by a closed
sub-riemannian geodesic.
  In the contact case, we prove a min-max result generalizing the celebrated
Lyusternik-Fet theorem: if $(M, \Delta)$ is a compact, contact manifold, then
every sub-riemannian metric on $\Delta$ carries at least one closed
sub-riemannian geodesic. This result is based on a combination of the above
topological results with a delicate study of the Palais-Smale condition in the
vicinity of abnormal loops (singular points of $\Lambda$).

show that the role of the paramagnetic current density in this relationship
becomes crucial when considering states with different magnetic quantum

complexity for the ""band structure"" present in ground state metric spaces, as
compared to previous studies varying scalar potentials. The robust nature of
the metric space approach is strengthened by demonstrating the gauge invariance
of the related metric for the paramagnetic current density. We go beyond ground

wavelength allocation in an optical network that employs Wavelength Division
Multiplexing (WDM). Consider an optical network that is represented by a
connected, simple graph $G$. We assume all communication channels are
bidirectional, so that all links and paths are undirected. It follows that
there are ${|G|\choose 2}$ distinct node pairs associated with $G$, where $|G|$
is the number of nodes in $G$. A path system $\mathcal{P}$ of $G$ consists of
${|G|\choose 2}$ paths, one path to connect each of the node pairs. The global
packing number of a path system $\mathcal{P}$, denoted by
$\Phi(G,\mathcal{P})$, is the minimum integer $k$ to guarantee the existence of
a mapping $\omega:\mathcal{P}\to\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$, such that
$\omega(P)\neq\omega(P')$ if $P$ and $P'$ have common edge(s). The global
packing number of $G$, denoted by $\Phi(G)$, is defined to be the minimum
$\Phi(G,\mathcal{P})$ among all possible path systems $\mathcal{P}$. If there
is no wavelength conversion along any optical transmission path for any node
pair in the network, the global packing number signifies the minimum number of
wavelengths required to support simultaneous communication for all pairs in the
network.
  In this paper, the focus is on ring networks, so that $G$ is a cycle.
Explicit formulas for the global packing number of a cycle is derived. The
investigation is further extended to chain networks. A path system,
$\mathcal{P}$, that enjoys $\Phi(G,\mathcal{P})=\Phi(G)$ is called ideal. A
characterization of ideal path systems is also presented. We also describe an
efficient heuristic algorithm to assign wavelengths that can be applied to a
general network with more complicated traffic load.

Wigner W-distribution and the Husimi Q-function. In the strong coupling regime
the Q-function evolves to uniformly separated macroscopically distinct Gaussian
peaks representing 'kitten' states at certain specified times that depend on
multiple time scales present in the interacting system. For the ultra-strong
coupling realm a large number of interaction-generated modes arise with a
complete randomization of their phases. A stochastic averaging of the dynamical
quantities sets in while leading to the decoherence of the system. The
delocalization in the phase space of the oscillator is studied by using the
Wehrl entropy. The negativity of the W-distribution, while registering its
departure from the classical states, allows us to compare the
information-theoretic measures such as the Wehrl entropy with the Wigner
entropy. Other features of nonclassicality such as the existence of the
squeezed states and appearance of negative values of the Mandel parameter are
realized during the course of evolution of the bipartite system. In the
parametric regime studied here these properties do not survive after a

outstanding problem. We develop an experimentally feasible control framework
for nonlinear dynamical networks that exhibit multistability (multiple
coexisting final states or attractors), which are representative of, e.g., gene
regulatory networks (GRNs). The control objective is to apply parameter
perturbation to drive the system from one attractor to another, assuming that
the former is undesired and the latter is desired. To make our framework
practically useful, we consider RESTRICTED parameter perturbation by imposing
the following two constraints: (a) it must be experimentally realizable and (b)
it is applied only temporarily. We introduce the concept of ATTRACTOR NETWORK,
in which the nodes are the distinct attractors of the system, and there is a
directional link from one attractor to another if the system can be driven from
the former to the latter using restricted control perturbation. Introduction of
the attractor network allows us to formulate a controllability framework for
nonlinear dynamical networks: a network is more controllable if the underlying
attractor network is more strongly connected, which can be quantified. We
demonstrate our control framework using examples from various models of
experimental GRNs. A finding is that, due to nonlinearity, noise can
counter-intuitively facilitate control of the network dynamics.

associated with the loop corrections are isolated in dimensional
regularization. The resulting axial current is finite and conserved in the
chiral limit, while the axial charge requires renormalization. A complete set
of contact terms for the axial charge up to the relevant order in the power
counting is constructed.

Veeravalli","Universal Outlying sequence detection For Continuous Observations",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The following detection problem is studied, in which there are $M$ sequences
of samples out of which one outlier sequence needs to be detected. Each typical
sequence contains $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
continuous observations from a known distribution $\pi$, and the outlier
sequence contains $n$ i.i.d. observations from an outlier distribution $\mu$,
which is distinct from $\pi$, but otherwise unknown. A universal test based on
KL divergence is built to approximate the maximum likelihood test, with known
$\pi$ and unknown $\mu$. A data-dependent partitions based KL divergence
estimator is employed. Such a KL divergence estimator is further shown to
converge to its true value exponentially fast when the density ratio satisfies
$0<K_1\leq \frac{d\mu}{d\pi}\leq K_2$, where $K_1$ and $K_2$ are positive
constants, and this further implies that the test is exponentially consistent.
The performance of the test is compared with that of a recently introduced test
for this problem based on the machine learning approach of maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD). We identify regimes in which the KL divergence based test is
better than the MMD based test.

node. This work describes the dynamical fundamentals of how the behaviour of
one node affects the whole network formed by coupled phase-oscillators with
heterogeneous coupling strengths. The synchronisation of phase-oscillators is
independent of the distribution of the natural frequencies, weakly depends on
the network size, but highly depends on only one key oscillator whose ratio
between its natural frequency in a rotating frame and its coupling strength is
maximum. This result is based on a novel method to calculate the critical
coupling strength with which the phase-oscillators emerge into frequency
synchronisation. In addition, we put forward an analytical method to
approximately calculate the phase-angles for the synchronous oscillators.

special relativity. The present study shows that since the formula has also
been derived from classical physics by Einstein, it is not an exclusively
relativistic result. The formula is implied by the classical electromagnetic
momentum P=E/c and the Newtonian definition of momentum P=mv. Like momentum
P=mv, E=mc^2 applies to both classical physics and special relativity, if
relativistic mass is used in the equation. The derivation by Einstein in 1905
is logically flawed as a relativistic proof and the truly relativistic formula
should be E=(E0)/(1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2) derived by Laue in 1911 and Klein in 1918.
If the energy measured in one reference frame is E0, it is
E=(E0)/(1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2) in a reference frame moving at velocity v relative to
the first frame.

science stop talking about simulating human intelligence or trying to explain
how brain works. Recently, represented by deep learning techniques, the field
of machine learning is experiencing unprecedented prosperity and some
applications with near human-level performance bring researchers confidence to
imply that their approaches are the promising candidate for understanding the
mechanism of human brain. However apart from several ancient philological
criteria and some imaginary black box tests (Turing test, Chinese room) there
is no computational level explanation, definition or criteria about
intelligence or any of its components. Base on the common sense that learning
ability is one critical component of intelligence and inspect from the
viewpoint of mapping relations, this paper presents two laws which explains
what is the ""learning ability"" as we familiar with and under what conditions a
mapping relation can be acknowledged as ""Learning Model"".

devised as m-connected k-dominating set problem, resembled by dominator and
dominate, such that dominators are resilient up to m-1 uncertainty among them
and dominate are resilient up to k-1 uncertainty on their way to dominators.
Therefore, an evolutionary algorithm GENESIS is proposed, which resolves
uncertainty by evolving population of solutions, while considering uncertain
constraints as sub-problems, started by initial populations by a greedy
algorithm AVIDO. Theoretical analysis first justifies original problem as
NP-hard problem. Eventually, the absence of polynomial time approximation
scheme necessitates justification of original problem as multiobjective
optimization problem. Furthermore, approximation to Pareto front is verified to
be decomposed into scalar optimization sub-problems, which lays out the
theoretical foundation for decomposition based evolutionary solution. Finally,
case-study, feasibility analysis and exemplary implication are presented for
evolvable autonomic management in combined cancer treatment with in-vivo sensor
networks.

chances that it will achieve its goals, is the best value for money, is
relevant to a national priority and will impact on a socio-economic problem.
