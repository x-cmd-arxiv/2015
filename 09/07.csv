introduce and study new mathematical objects which we call ""higher theories"" of
algebras, where inspiration for the term comes from William Lawvere's notion of
""algebraic theory"". Indeed, our ""theories"" are `higher order' generalizations
of coloured operad or multicategory, where we see an operad as analogous to
Lawvere's theory.
  Higher theories are obtained by iterating a certain process, which we call
""theorization"", generalizing categorification in the sense of Louis Crane. The
hierarchy of all iterated theorizations contains in particular, the hierarchy
of all higher categories.
  As an expanded introduction to the mentioned work, we here introduce the
notion of theorization, discuss basic ideas, notions, examples, facts and
problems about theorization, and describe how these lead to our work, and what
will be achieved.

method is first illustrated by application to two other problems, (1) the
problem of oscillations of a particle in a cubic potential that has a
well-known analytic solution in terms of elliptic functions and (2) periodic
solutions and corresponding eigenvalues of a generalized Mathieu equation that
cannot be solved analytically. When applied to the three body problem it turns
out that the Fourier-Taylor series, evaluated up to 30th order, represents
un-physical solutions except for a particular value of the series parameter.
For this value the series approximates the numerical solution known from the
literature up to a relative error of $1.6\times 10^{-3}$.

perform T-duality along non-isometric directions. In particular, based on a
recent work of Kotov and Strobl, we study gauged 2D sigma models where gauge
invariance for an extended set of gauge transformations imposes weaker
constraints than in the standard case, notably the corresponding vector fields
are not Killing. This formulation enables us to follow a procedure analogous to
the derivation of the Buscher rules and obtain two dual models, by integrating

a centrosymmetric (R-3c) to non-centrosymmetric (R3c) transition in metallic
LiOsO3 that is structurally equivalent to the ferroelectric transition of

result is that error backpropagation on a convolutional network is equivalent
to playing out a circadian game. It follows immediately that the waking-regret

important issue in statistical classification, whenever different clustering
results need to be compared. Developing from the traditional Hamming distance
between subsets or cardinality of their symmetric difference, this work
considers alternative metric distances between partitions. With one exception,
all of them obtain as minimum-weight paths in the undirected graph
corresponding to the Hasse diagram of the partition lattice. Firstly, by
focusing on the atoms of the lattice, one well-known partition distance is
recognized to be in fact the analog of the Hamming distance between subsets,
with weights on edges of the Hasse diagram determined through the number of
atoms in the unique maximal join-decomposition of partitions. Secondly, another
partition distance known as ""variation of information"" is seen to correspond to
a minimum-weight path with edge weights determined by the entropy of
partitions. These two distances are next compared in terms of their upper and
lower bounds over all pairs of partitions that are complements of one another.
What emerges is that the two distances share the same minimizers and
maximizers, while a much rawer behavior is observed for the partition distance
which does not correspond to a minimum-weight path. The idea of measuring the
distance between partitions by means of minimum-weight paths in the Hasse
diagram is further explored by considering alternative symmetric and
order-preserving/inverting partition functions (such as the the rank, in the
simplest case) for assigning weights to edges. What matters most, in such a
general setting, turns out to be whether the weighting function is supermodular
or else submodular, as this makes any minimum-weight path visit the meet or
else the join of the two partitions, depending on order preserving/inverting.

applied to solve the H-formulation of Maxwell's equations considering the
nonlinear properties of both the superconducting material and its surrounding

was obtained from the computed elastoplastic deformation of a round Ni wire, 3)
the last model was based on a simplified elliptic cross section. The last

place of data-replication, since they provide the same level of reliability

explicit erasure codes for distributed storage with the following desirable
properties motivated by practice: (i) Maximum-Distance-Separable (MDS): to
provide maximal reliability at minimum storage overhead, (ii) Optimal
repair-bandwidth: to minimize the amount of data needed to be transferred to
repair a failed node from remaining ones, (iii) Flexibility in repair: to allow
maximal flexibility in selecting subset of nodes to use for repair, which
includes not requiring that all surviving nodes be used for repair, (iv)
Systematic Form: to ensure that the original data exists in uncoded form, and
(v) Fast encoding: to minimize the cost of generating encoded data (enabled by
a sparse generator matrix).
  This paper presents the first explicit code construction which theoretically
guarantees all the five desired properties simultaneously. Our construction
builds on a powerful class of codes called Product-Matrix (PM) codes. PM codes
satisfy properties (i)-(iii), and either (iv) or (v), but not both
simultaneously. Indeed, native PM codes have inherent structure that leads to
sparsity, but this structure is destroyed when the codes are made systematic.
We first present an analytical framework for understanding the interaction
between the design of PM codes and the systematic property. Using this
framework, we provide an explicit code construction that simultaneously
achieves all the above desired properties. We also present general ways of
transforming existing storage and repair optimal codes to enable fast encoding
through sparsity. In practice, such sparse codes result in encoding speedup by
a factor of about 4 for typical parameters.

focus on the relation of topological to measure-theoretic notions of and

infinite-dimensional case, and are difficult to work with on their own as well
in that context. Even in cases where an appropriate family of spacetimes is
finite-dimensional, however, and so admits a measure of the relevant sort, it
is always the case that the family is not a compact topological space, and so
does not admit a physically significant, well behaved probability measure.
Problems of a different but still deeply troubling sort plague arguments about
likelihood in that context, which I also discuss. I conclude that most standard

occurrence of various properties or behaviors of spacetimes have serious

cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation which has larger statistical
significance than the Cold Spot (CS) anomaly and comparable size. This
temperature anomaly is aligned with a huge large quasar group (HLQG), and for
this reason we call it HLQG anomaly. There are different physical phenomena by
which the HLQG could have produced the observed temperature anomaly, such as
for example the Sunyaev Zeldovich (SZ), the integrated Sachs Wolfe (ISW) or the
Rees Sciama (RS) effect. The goal of this paper it is not to explain the
observed alignment in terms of these effects, but to show the shape and
position of the HLQG anomaly, and estimate its statistical significance, i.e.
the probability that it could be just the result of primordial Gaussian
fluctuations. We analyze the CMB Planck satellite temperature map of the region
of sky corresponding to the angular position of the HLQG, and compute an inner
and an outer temperature by averaging the CMB map over respectively the region
subtended by the HLQG on the sky, and over a region surrounding it. It turns
out that the inner region is warmer than the outer one, with a measured
temperature difference of $\Delta T^{obs} \approx 43\mu K$. The temperature
excess is then compared with the results of Montecarlo simulations of random
Gaussian realizations of the CMB map, indicating with at least a $2.3\sigma$
confidence level, that the measured $\Delta T^{obs}$ cannot be attributed to
primordial Gaussian fluctuations. Its alignment with HLQG and suggests that
this could be due to the Rees-Sciama effect. Our results are stable under the

is the consideration of the time dependency of the network, a realistic
characteristic of urban road networks, which has not been considered previously

two-dimensional phosphorene has been proposed as a very promising electrode
material due to its ultrafast and directional lithium diffusion, as well as
large energy capacity. Here, on the basis of density functional theory, we
report that the intrinsic point defects, including vacancy and stone-wales
defects, will block the directional ultrafast diffusion of lithium in
phosphorene. On the defect-free phosphorene, diffusion of Li along the zigzag
lattice direction is 1.6 billion times faster than along the armchair lattice
direction, and 260 times faster than that in graphite. By introducing intrinsic
vacancy and stone-wales defect, the diffusion energy barrier of Li along zigzag
lattice direction increases sharply to the range of 0.17 ~ 0.49 eV, which block
the ultrafast migration of lithium along the zigzag lattice direction.
Meanwhile, the open circuit voltage increases with the emergence of defects,
which is not suitable for anode materials. In addition, the formation energies
of defects in phosphorene are much lower than those in graphene and silicene
sheet, therefore, it is highly demanded to generate defect-free phosphorene for
LIB applications.

enjoy the greenness brought by EH while overcoming the instability of the
renewable energy sources, hybrid energy supply (HES) networks that are powered
by both EH and the electric grid have emerged as a new paradigm for green
communications. In this paper, we will propose new design methodologies for HES
green cellular networks with the help of Lyapunov optimization techniques. The
network service cost, which addresses both the grid energy consumption and
achievable QoS, is adopted as the performance metric, and it is optimized via
base station assignment and power control (BAPC). Our main contribution is a
low-complexity online algorithm to minimize the long-term average network
service cost, namely, the Lyapunov optimization-based BAPC (LBAPC) algorithm.
One main advantage of this algorithm is that the decisions depend only on the
instantaneous side information without requiring distribution information of
channels and EH processes. To determine the network operation, we only need to
solve a deterministic per-time slot problem, for which an efficient inner-outer
optimization algorithm is proposed. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown
to be asymptotically optimal via rigorous analysis. Finally, sample simulation
results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis as well as validate
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

the influence of the fractional phase of anyons within the many-body

relying on the ansatz of matrix product states. As a result it turns out that
the anyonic quasi-momentum distribution reveals both a peak-shift and an
asymmetry which mainly originates from the nonlocal string property. In
addition, we determine the corresponding quasi-momentum distribution of the

structure. The measured brightness temperatures of the cores range from
$10^{8.4}$ to $10^{11.4}$ K with a median value of $10^{10.1}$ K, indicating
that the radio emission is from non-thermal jets, and that, likely, most
sources are not strongly beamed, then implying a lower jet speed in these
radio-loud NLS1 galaxies. In combination with archival data taken at multiple
frequencies, we find that seven sources show flat or even inverted radio
spectra, while steep spectra are revealed in the remaining seven objects.
Although all these sources are very radio-loud with $R > 100$, their jet
properties are diverse, in terms of their milli-arcsecond (mas) scale (pc
scale) morphology and their overall radio spectral shape. The evidence for slow
jet speeds (i.e., less relativistic jets), in combination with the low
kinetic/radio power, may offer an explanation for the compact VLBA radio
structure in most sources. The mildly relativistic jets in these high accretion
rate systems are consistent with a scenario, where jets are accelerated from
the hot corona above the disk by the magnetic field and the radiation force of
the accretion disk. Alternatively, a low jet bulk velocity can be explained by
low spin in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism.

the zone corner, which causes energy-independent unidirectional interference
fringes, observed in real space as standing waves by scattering electrons off
C2 domain walls and Se-defects. On the other hand, the formation of C2 nematic

which is induced by the lattice mismatch between the film and substrate. Our
results establish a clean case that the nematicity is driven by electronic

X-ray brightest, nearby, merging system hosting a well studied, typical giant
radio halo. It has been previously shown that, on the western side of the
cluster, the radio brightness shows a much steeper gradient compared to other
azimuths. XMM-Newton and Planck revealed a shock front along the southern half
of the region associated with this steep radio gradient, suggesting that the
radio emission is enhanced by particle acceleration associated with the shock
passage. Suzaku demonstrates for the first time that this shock front extends
northwards, tracing the entire length of the western edge of the Coma radio
halo. The shock is detected both in the temperature and X-ray surface
brightness distributions and has a Mach number of around $\mathcal{M}\sim1.5$.
The locations of the surface brightness edges align well with the edge of the
radio emission, while the obtained temperature profiles seem to suggest shocks
located 125-185 kpc further out in radius. In addition, the shock strengths
derived from the temperature and density jumps are in agreement when using
extraction regions parallel to the radio halo edge, but become inconsistent
with each other when derived from radial profiles centred on the Coma Cluster
core. It is likely that, beyond mere projection effects, the geometry of the
shock is more complex than a front with a single, uniform Mach number and an
approximately spherically symmetric shape.

constructed in the N=4 superconformal coset SU(5)/SU(3) theory previously. In
this paper, by rewriting the above OPEs in the N=4 superspace developed by
Schoutens (and other groups), the remaining undetermined OPEs where the
corresponding singular terms possess the composite fields with spins s =7/2, 4,
9/2, 5 are completely determined. Furthermore, by introducing the arbitrary
coefficients in front of the composite fields in the right hand sides of the
above complete 136 OPEs, reexpressing them in the N=2 superspace and using the
N=2 OPEs mathematica package by Krivonos and Thielemans, the complete
structures of the above OPEs with fixed coefficient functions are obtained with
the help of various Jacobi identities. Then one obtains ten N=2 super OPEs
between the four N=2 higher spin currents denoted by (1, 3/2, 3/2, 2), (3/2, 2,
2, 5/2), (3/2, 2, 2, 5/2) and (2, 5/2, 5/2, 3) (corresponding 136 OPEs in the

Finally, one describes them as one single N=4 super OPE between the above
sixteen higher spin currents in the N=4 superspace. The fusion rule for this
OPE contains the next 16 higher spin currents of spins of (2, 5/2, 5/2, 5/2,

lowest higher spin multiplet and the large N=4 linear superconformal family of
the identity operator. The various structure constants (fixed coefficient
functions) appearing in the right hand side of this OPE depend on N and the
level k of the bosonic spin-1 affine Kac-Moody current.

believed to have been produced in the ejecta of core-collapse supernovae (SNe).
In order to clarify the formation condition of such large Al2O3 grains, we
investigate the condensation of Al2O3 grains for wide ranges of the gas density
and cooling rate. We first show that the average radius and condensation
efficiency of newly formed Al2O3 grains are successfully described by a
non-dimensional quantity ""Lambda_on"" defined as the ratio of the timescale with
which the supersaturation ratio increases to the collision timescale of
reactant gas species at dust formation. Then, we find that the formation of
submicron-sized Al2O3 grains requires at least ten times higher gas densities
than those presented by one-dimensional SN models. This indicates that presolar
Al2O3 grains identified as a SN origin might be formed in dense gas clumps,
allowing us to propose that the measured sizes of presolar grains can be a
powerful tool to constrain the physical conditions in which they formed. We
also briefly discuss the survival of newly formed Al2O3 grains against the
destruction in the shocked gas within the SN remnants.

coordination of stepping with rhythmic auditory cues (auditory cueing, AC). AC
changes the long-range correlations among consecutive strides (fractal

lengths with marks on the floor. The effects of VC on the fluctuation structure
of walking have not been investigated. Therefore, the objective was to compare
the effects of AC and VC on the fluctuation pattern of basic spatiotemporal
gait parameters. Thirty-six healthy individuals walked 3 x 500 strides on an
instrumented treadmill with augmented reality capabilities. The conditions were
no cueing (NC), AC, and VC. AC included an isochronous metronome. In VC,
projected stepping stones were synchronized with the treadmill speed. Detrended
fluctuation analysis assessed the correlation structure. The coefficient of
variation (CV) was also assessed. The results showed that AC and VC similarly
induced a strong anti-correlated pattern in the gait parameters. The CVs were
similar between the NC and AC conditions but substantially higher in the VC
condition. AC and VC probably mobilize similar motor control pathways and can
be used alternatively in gait rehabilitation. However, the increased gait
variability induced by VC should be considered.

on the analysis of Andreev bound state (ABS), we clarify that current-phase

that the emergence of crossing points of ABS is a key ingredient to generate
$\sin2\varphi$ dependence in current-phase relation. We further study both the

a remarkable similarity with phase diagrams of strongly correlated systems as a
function of doping, with magnetic ordering on the one end and Fermi-liquid-like
behaviour on the other. Moreover, it has been suggested [PRL 101, 176803
(2008)] that a BCS correlated state of composite fermions with p-wave pairing
may exist in the intermediate region. In the same region, an exact
diagonalization study in the torus geometry [PRB 69, 045319 (2004)] pointed out
the existence of state(s) with pseudospin spiraling order. Here we reconcile
these two descriptions of the intermediate state by considering the underlying
bosonic representation of the composite fermion paired state in the long
distance limit, and by performing extensive exact diagonalizations on the
torus. We argue that the spiraling states belong to the manifold of degenerate
ground state(s), and are a consequence of Bose condensation of the
quasiparticles (with critical algebraic correlations) at non-zero momenta in
the two pseudospin states. The spiraling states, generated in this way as
spin-textures, can be identified with meron-antimeron constructions. Thus,
merons -- the fractionally charged vortex excitations of the XY magnetically
ordered state -- constitute some of the topological sectors. It follows that
merons are deconfined in the intermediate state, and allow for a smooth
transition between the magnetically ordered and Fermi-liquid-like phases, in
which they are bound in pairs.

Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, which also generates the mass terms for the two
Higgs doublets through quartic Higgs couplings. Their masses are all positive
but, nevertheless, the electroweak symmetry breaking is realized by the bosonic
seesaw mechanism. We analyze the renormalization group evolutions for all model
couplings, and find that a large hierarchy among the quartic Higgs couplings,
which is crucial for the bosonic seesaw mechanism to work, is dramatically
reduced toward high energies. Therefore, the bosonic seesaw is naturally
realized with only a mild hierarchy, if some fundamental theory, which provides
the origin of the classically conformal invariance, completes our model at some
high energy, for example, the Planck scale. The requirements for the
perturbativity of the running couplings and the electroweak vacuum stability in
the renormalization group analysis as well as for the naturalness of the
electroweak scale, we have identified the regions of model parameters. For
example, the scale of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry breaking is constrained
to be $\lesssim 100$ TeV, which corresponds to the extra heavy Higgs boson
masses to be $\lesssim 2$ TeV. Such heavy Higgs bosons can be tested at the

increases rapidly (even though it never diverges) as one approaches the

assess how well atomic carbon traces H2 at low metallicity, we have performed a

smaller than $X_{\rm CI}$, by a factor of a few or more. We have also examined
how $X_{\rm CI}$ and $X_{\rm CO}$ evolve with time. We find that $X_{\rm CI}$
does not vary strongly with time, demonstrating that atomic carbon remains a
good tracer of H2 in metal-poor systems even at times significantly before the

will be the first CTA scientific analysis of data acquired from the array of
telescopes, in both northern and southern sites. The On-Site Analysis will have
two pipelines: the Level-A pipeline (also known as Real-Time Analysis, RTA) and
the level-B one. The RTA performs data quality monitoring and must be able to
issue automated alerts on variable and transient astrophysical sources within
30 seconds from the last acquired Cherenkov event that contributes to the
alert, with a sensitivity not worse than the one achieved by the final pipeline
by more than a factor of 3. The Level-B Analysis has a better sensitivity (not
be worse than the final one by a factor of 2) and the results should be
available within 10 hours from the acquisition of the data: for this reason
this analysis could be performed at the end of an observation or next morning.
The latency (in particular for the RTA) and the sensitivity requirements are
challenging because of the large data rate, a few GByte/s. The remote
connection to the CTA candidate site with a rather limited network bandwidth
makes the issue of the exported data size extremely critical and prevents any
kind of processing in real-time of the data outside the site of the telescopes.
For these reasons the analysis will be performed on-site with infrastructures
co-located with the telescopes, with limited electrical power availability and
with a reduced possibility of human intervention. This means, for example, that
the on-site hardware infrastructure should have low-power consumption. A
substantial effort towards the optimization of high-throughput computing
service is envisioned to provide hardware and software solutions with
high-throughput, low-power consumption at a low-cost.

aspects is the assessment of the heat transport at the nanoscale sized

a scanning thermal microscopy, or SThM, which demonstrates the highest spatial

undermined by the poorly defined nature of the nanoscale contact between the

shear force and the heat flow in the probe-sample junction shows distinct
correlation between thermal conductance and maximal shear force in the junction
for multiple probe-material combinations. Quantitative analysis of this

the tip-surface nanoscale contact suggesting that they are, ultimately,
composed of near-atomic sized regions.
  Furthermore, in analogy to the Wiedemann-Franz law, which links electrical
and thermal conductivity in metals, we suggest and experimentally confirm a
general relation that links shear strength and thermal conductance in nanoscale
contacts via the fundamental material properties of heat capacity and heat
carrier group velocity, thus opening new avenues for quantitative exploration

spot prices. We estimate the considered linear regression model by the lasso
estimation method. The lasso approach allows for many possible parameters in
the model, but also shrinks and sparsifies the parameters automatically to
avoid overfitting. Thus, it is able to capture the autoregressive intraday
dependency structure of the electricity price well. We discuss in detail the
estimation results which provide insights to the intraday behavior of
electricity prices. We perform an out-of-sample forecasting study for several
European electricity markets. The results illustrate well that the efficient
lasso based estimation technique can exhibit advantages from two popular model
approaches.

noisy sensory samples from the stimulus. Basic statistical considerations state
that the reliability of the stimulus information, i.e., the amount of noise in
the samples, should be taken into account when the decision is made. However,
for perceptual decision making experiments it has been questioned whether the
brain indeed uses the reliability for making decisions when confronted with
unpredictable changes in stimulus reliability. We here show that even the basic
drift diffusion model, which has frequently been used to explain experimental
findings in perceptual decision making, implicitly relies on estimates of
stimulus reliability. We then show that only those variants of the drift
diffusion model which allow stimulus-specific reliabilities are consistent with
neurophysiological findings. Our analysis suggests that the brain estimates the
reliability of the stimulus on a short time scale of at most a few hundred
milliseconds.

shows a diversity between the extracted features of the scripts, which makes

ground-based Cherenkov telescopes of the Imaging class with the aim of
exploring the highest energy region of the electromagnetic spectrum. With two
planned arrays, one for each hemisphere, it will guarantee a good sky coverage
in the energy range from a few tens of GeV to hundreds of TeV, with improved
angular resolution and a sensitivity in the TeV energy region better by one
order of magnitude than the currently operating arrays. In order to cover this
wide energy range, three different telescope types are envisaged, with
different mirror sizes and focal plane features. In particular, for the highest
energies a possible design is a dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder optical
scheme, with a compact focal plane. A silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) based
camera is being proposed as a solution to match the dimensions of the pixel
(angular size of ~ 0.17 degrees). INFN is developing a camera demonstrator made
by 9 Photo Sensor Modules (PSMs, 64 pixels each, with total coverage 1/4 of the
focal plane) equipped with FBK (Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy) Near
UltraViolet High Fill factor SiPMs and Front-End Electronics (FEE) based on a
Target 7 ASIC, a 16 channels fast sampler (up to 2GS/s) with deep buffer,
self-trigger and on-demand digitization capabilities specifically developed for
this purpose. The pixel dimensions of $6\times6$ mm$^2$ lead to a very compact
design with challenging problems of thermal dissipation. A modular structure,
made by copper frames hosting one PSM and the corresponding FEE, has been
conceived, with a water cooling system to keep the required working
temperature. The actual design, the adopted technical solutions and the
achieved results for this demonstrator are presented and discussed.

of a probabilistic neighborhood in spatial data: Let a set $P$ of $n$ points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, a query point $q \in \mathbb{R}^d$, a distance metric $\dist$,
and a monotonically decreasing function $f : \mathbb{R}^+ \rightarrow [0,1]$ be
given. Then a point $p \in P$ belongs to the probabilistic neighborhood $N(q,
f)$ of $q$ with respect to $f$ with probability $f(\dist(p,q))$. We envision
applications in facility location, sensor networks, and other scenarios where a
connection between two entities becomes less likely with increasing distance. A
straightforward query algorithm would determine a probabilistic neighborhood in
$\Theta(n\cdot d)$ time by probing each point in $P$.
  To answer the query in sublinear time for the planar case, we augment a
quadtree suitably and design a corresponding query algorithm. Our theoretical
analysis shows that -- for certain distributions of planar $P$ -- our algorithm
answers a query in $O((|N(q,f)| + \sqrt{n})\log n)$ time with high probability
(whp). This matches up to a logarithmic factor the cost induced by
quadtree-based algorithms for deterministic queries and is asymptotically
faster than the straightforward approach whenever $|N(q,f)| \in o(n / \log n)$.
  As practical proofs of concept we use two applications, one in the Euclidean
and one in the hyperbolic plane. In particular, our results yield the first
generator for random hyperbolic graphs with arbitrary temperatures in
subquadratic time. Moreover, our experimental data show the usefulness of our
algorithm even if the point distribution is unknown or not uniform: The running
time savings over the pairwise probing approach constitute at least one order
of magnitude already for a modest number of points and queries.

of a topological Weyl semimetal near the Weyl nodes with the help of a two-node
model that includes all the topological semimetal properties. In the semimetal
phase, the Fermi energy crosses only the 0th Landau bands in magnetic fields.
For a finite potential range of impurities, it is found that both the
longitudinal and transverse magnetoconductivity are positive and linear at the
Weyl nodes, leading to an anisotropic and negative magnetoresistivity. The
longitudinal magnetoconductivity depends on the potential range of impurities.
The longitudinal conductivity remains finite at zero field, even though the

in the interval $1\leq n\leq x$ is $K/{\sqrt{\log x}}$, where $K$ is the
Landau-Ramanujan constant. It is an old problem in number theory whether the
asymptotic density remains the same in intervals $|n-x|\leq x^{\epsilon}$ for a
fixed $\epsilon$ and $x\to \infty$.
  This work resolves a function field analogue of this problem, in the limit of
a large finite field. More precisely, consider monic $f_0\in \mathbb{F}_q[T]$
of degree $n$ and take $\epsilon$ with $1>\epsilon\geq \frac2n$. Then the
asymptotic density of polynomials $f$ in the `interval' ${\rm deg}(f-f_0)\leq
\epsilon n$ that are of the form $f=A^2+TB^2$, $A,B\in \mathbb{F}_q[T]$ is
$\frac{1}{4^n}\binom{2n}{n}$ as $q\to \infty$. This density agrees with the
asymptotic density of such monic $f$'s of degree $n$ as $q\to \infty$, as was
shown by the second author, Smilanski, and Wolf.
  A key point in the proof is the calculation of the Galois group of $f(-T^2)$,
where $f$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ with a few variable coefficients: The
Galois group is the hyperoctahedral group of order $2^nn!$.

restrictive assumptions, including the applicability of the quasistatic

rephrase EELS as a tomography scheme for the reconstruction of plasmonic

inverse problem, and show that the complete dyadic Green tensor can be
reconstructed for plasmonic particles of arbitrary shape. The key steps
underlying our approach are a generic singular value decomposition of the
dyadic Green tensor and a compressed sensing optimization for the determination
of the expansion coefficients. We demonstrate the applicability of our scheme

traditional matrix nuclear norm in a block circulant way. We test the t-TNN

transformation, exploits the horizontal translation relationship between the

are restricted to data on the same one-dimensional interval. The presented
approach focuses on multivariate functional data on different domains that may
differ in dimension, e.g. functions and images. The theoretical basis for
multivariate functional principal component analysis is given in terms of a
Karhunen-Lo\`eve Theorem. For the practically relevant case of a finite
Karhunen-Lo\`eve representation, a relationship between univariate and
multivariate functional principal component analysis is established. This
offers an estimation strategy to calculate multivariate functional principal
components and scores based on their univariate counterparts. For the resulting
estimators, asymptotic results are derived. The approach can be extended to
finite univariate expansions in general, not necessarily orthonormal bases. It
is also applicable for sparse functional data or data with measurement error. A
flexible R-implementation is available on CRAN. The new method is shown to be
competitive to existing approaches for data observed on a common
one-dimensional domain. The motivating application is a neuroimaging study,
where the goal is to explore how longitudinal trajectories of a
neuropsychological test score covary with FDG-PET brain scans at baseline.

push forward research in lurker mining in a twofold manner: (i) to provide an

lurkers and their relations with other users, and (ii) to enhance existing
methods for ranking lurkers by integrating different time-aware properties

the efficiency of the regulation to limit the fluctuations of the number of
copies of a given protein. The autoregulation considered in this paper relies
mainly on a negative feedback: the proteins are repressors of their own gene
expression. The efficiency of a production process without feedback control is
compared to a production process with an autoregulation of the gene expression
assuming that both of them produce the same average number of proteins. The
main characteristic used for the comparison is the standard deviation of the
number of proteins at equilibrium. With a Markovian representation and a simple
model of repression, we prove that, under a scaling regime, the repression
mechanism follows a Hill repression scheme with an hyperbolic control. An
explicit asymptotic expression of the variance of the number of proteins under
this regulation mechanism is obtained. Simulations are used to study other
aspects of autoregulation such as the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the

observe Very High Energy (VHE) gamma ray sources. The PMTs in their cameras are
designed to operate under moonlight, but they are limited to Moon phases below
93% (300 Moon hours per year), as they can get damaged if the amount of light
they receive is too high. As a result, they cannot be used in the three to five
nights around full Moon. We have selected commercial inexpensive UV-pass
filters rejecting light above a wavelength of 420 nm, where the moonlight
intensity is stronger. We mounted them on light-weight frames that can be
easily installed on the telescope cameras. Test observations have been
performed during the last nine months, from which a moonlight transmission of
about 20% and a Cherenkov light transmission of about 45% are estimated. This
allows the observation of sources down to an angular distance of 5 degrees to
the Moon during Full Moon: essentially in the whole sky and all possible
moonlight conditions. Therefore, the duty cycle of MAGIC can be extended by
about 30%, including nights when VHE observations with IACTs are currently not
feasible. Here we evaluate the preliminary performance, in terms of sensitivity
and energy threshold, of the MAGIC telescopes equipped with the UV-pass filters
under different moonlight intensities, as inferred from Crab Nebula
observations and Monte Carlo simulations.

described by Dirac and Schroedinger-Pauli equations considering different

the electron in the axial direction. We highlight that when the electron
undergoes a region with extremely strong magnetic field the relativistic and
non-relativistic dynamics differ substantially, so that the description given
by Schroedinger-Pauli equation enables the electron traveling faster than c,
which is prohibited by Einstein's theory of relativity. This approach allows a

first-order logic equality is modelled by a `diagonal' constant, interpreted in

`diagonal') relation. Here we study the decision problem of products of two
arbitrary modal logics equipped with such a diagonal. As the presence or
absence of equality in two-variable first-order logic does not influence the
complexity of its satisfiability problem, one might expect that adding a
diagonal to product logics in general is similarly harmless. We show that this
is far from being the case, and there can be quite a big jump in complexity,
even from decidable to the highly undecidable. Our undecidable logics can also
be viewed as new fragments of first- order logic where adding equality changes
a decidable fragment to undecidable. We prove our results by a novel
application of counter machine problems. While our formalism apparently cannot
force reliable counter machine computations directly, the presence of a unique
diagonal in the models makes it possible to encode both lossy and
insertion-error computations, for the same sequence of instructions. We show
that, given such a pair of faulty computations, it is then possible to

partition function could be computed by the multi-point functions in the

the leading order of $c$, the multi-point function is further simplified to be
a summation over the product of two-point functions, which may form links. Each
link is in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy class of the Schottky
group of the Riemann surface. Moreover, the value of a link is determined by
the eigenvalue of the element in the conjugate class. This allows us to
reproduce exactly the gravitational 1-loop partition function. The proof can be

few other versions of the skew t-distributions are also nested within the CFUST

of the construction is to consider two foliations of a spacetime by spacelike
hypersurfaces and relate the two geometries. The treatment is expected to be
useful in various situations, and in particular whenever one would like to
compare objects represented in different coordinates. Potential examples
include the construction of initial data and the study of trapped tubes. It is
common for studies in mathematical relativity to employ a double-null gauge. In
such studies local well-posedness is treated by referring back, for example, to
the generalized harmonic formulation, global properties of solutions being
treated in a separate formalism. As a first application of the dual foliation
formulation we find that one can in fact obtain local well-posedness in the
double-null coordinates directly, which should allow their use in numerical
relativity with standard methods. With due care it is expected that practically
any coordinates can be used with this approach.

black holes (BHs) in active galactic nuclei, based on a correlation between the
velocities of BHs relative to their host galaxies, |\Delta v|, and their
obscuring dust column densities, \Sigma_{dust} (both measured along the line of
sight). We use toy models for the distribution of recoil velocities, BH
trajectories, and the geometry of obscuring dust tori in galactic centres, to
simulate 2.5x10^5 random observations of recoiling quasars. BHs with recoil
velocities comparable to the escape velocity from the galactic centre remain
bound to the nucleus, and do not fully settle back to the centre of the torus
due to dynamical friction in a typical quasar lifetime. We find that |\Delta v|
and \Sigma_ {dust} for these BHs are positively correlated. For obscured
(\Sigma_{dust}>0) and for partially obscured (0<\Sigma_{dust}<~2.3 g/m^2)
quasars with |\Delta v|>=45 km/s, the sample correlation coefficient between
log10(|\Delta v|) and \Sigma_{dust} is r_{45} = 0.28+/-0.02 and r_{45} =
0.13+/-0.02, respectively. Allowing for random +/-100 km/s errors in |\Delta v|
unrelated to the recoil dilutes the correlation for the partially obscured
quasars to r_{45} = 0.026+/-0.004 measured between |\Delta v| and
\Sigma_{dust}. A random sample of >~3,500 obscured quasars with |\Delta v|>=45
km/s would allow rejection of the no-correlation hypothesis with 3 sigma
significance 95% of the time. Finally, we find that the fraction of obscured
quasars, F_{obs}(|\Delta v|), decreases with |\Delta v| from F_{obs}(<10
km/s)>~0.8 to F_{obs}(>10^3 km/s)<~0.4. This predicted trend can be compared to
the observed fraction of type II quasars, and can further test combinations of
recoil, trajectory, and dust torus models.

real-time quantum evolution of fermionic fields coupled to classical
electromagnetic fields, which are in turn coupled to the vacuum expectation
value of the fermionic electric current. We use Wilson-Dirac Hamiltonian for
fermions, and non-compact action for the gauge field. In general, we observe
that the backreaction of fermions on the electromagnetic field prevents the
system from acquiring chirality imbalance. In the case of chirality pumping in
parallel electric and magnetic fields, electric field is screened by the
produced on-shell fermions and the accumulation of chirality is hence stopped.
In the case of evolution with initially present chirality imbalance, axial
charge tends to transform to helicity of electromagnetic field. By performing
simulations on large lattices we show that in most cases this decay process is
accompanied by the inverse cascade phenomenon which transfers energy from
short-wavelength to long-wavelength electromagnetic fields. In some
simulations, however, we observe a very clear signature of inverse cascade for
the helical magnetic fields which is not accompanied by the axial charge decay.
This suggests that the relation between inverse cascade and axial charge decay
is not as straightforward as predicted by the simplest form of anomalous
Maxwell equations.

transportation of an ssDNA for nanopore sequencing. As adsorbed on a terraced
graphene na-nopore, the ssDNA has no in-plane swing nearby the nanopore, and
can be locked on graphene terraces in a stretched con-formation. Under biasing,
the accumulated ions near the nanopore promote the translocation of the locked
ssDNA, and also disturb the balance between the driven force and resistance
force acted on the nucleotide in pore. A critical force is found to be
necessary in trigging the kickoff of the ssDNA translocation, implying an
inherent field effect of the terraced graphene nanopore. By changing the
intensities of electric field as trigger signal, the stop and go of an ssDNA in
the nanopore are manipulated at single nucleobase level. The velocity of ssDNA
in the nanopore can also be regulated by the frequency of the

lattice still needs further developments. In this work, to obtain more stable
N-doped CNTs, concentric double-walled (DW) CNTs with more N were synthesized
using benzylamine as C and N source. In order to test the stability of N-doped
DWCNTs, high-temperature annealing in vacuum was performed. By XPS and Raman
spectroscopic measurements, we found that the N-doped DWCNTs are still stable
under 1500 $\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$: the graphitic N does not change at all, the
molecular N is partly removed, and the pyridinic N ratio greatly increases by
more than two times. The reason could be that the N atoms from the surrounded
N-contained materials combine into the CNT lattice during the annealing.
Compared with the undoped DWCNTs, no Raman frequency shift was observed for the
RBM, the G-band, and the G'-band of the N-doped DWCNTs.

plausible trajectories of ego-motion given a depth image. We predict paths
avoiding obstacles, between objects, even paths turning around a corner into
space behind objects. As a byproduct of the predicted trajectories of
ego-motion, we discover in the image the empty space occluded by foreground
objects. We use no image based features such as semantic labeling/segmentation
or object detection/recognition for this algorithm. Inspired by proxemics, we
represent the space around a person using an EgoSpace map, akin to an
illustrated tourist map, that measures a likelihood of occlusion at the
egocentric coordinate system. A future trajectory of ego-motion is modeled by a
linear combination of compact trajectory bases allowing us to constrain the
predicted trajectory. We learn the relationship between the EgoSpace map and
trajectory from the EgoMotion dataset providing in-situ measurements of the
future trajectory. A cost function that takes into account partial occlusion
due to foreground objects is minimized to predict a trajectory. This cost
function generates a trajectory that passes through the occluded space, which
allows us to discover the empty space behind the foreground objects. We
quantitatively evaluate our method to show predictive validity and apply to
various real world scenes including walking, shopping, and social interactions.

inequality for the bi-Laplace operator in the case of so-called ""clamped""
boundary conditions , that is, homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann conditions
simultaneously. We also prove a resolvent estimate for the generator of the
damped plate semigroup associated with these boundary conditions. The spectral
inequality allows one to observe finite sums of eigenfunctions for this
fourth-order elliptic operator, from an arbitrary open subset of the manifold.
Moreover, the constant that appears in the inequality grows as exp(C$\mu$ 1/4)
where $\mu$ is the largest eigenvalue associated with the eigenfunctions
appearing in the sum. This type of inequality is known for the Laplace
operator. As an application, we obtain a null-controllability result for a
higher-order parabolic equation. The resolvent estimate provides the spectral
behavior of the plate semigroup generator on the imaginary axis. This type of
estimate is known in the case of the damped wave semigroup. As an application ,
we deduce a stabilization result for the damped plate equation, with a log-type
decay. The proofs of both the spectral inequality and the resolvent estimate
are based on the derivation of different types of Carleman estimates for an
elliptic operator related to the bi-Laplace operator: in the interior and at
some boundaries. One of these estimates exhibits a loss of one full derivative.
Its proof requires the introduction of an appropriate semi-classical calculus
and a delicate microlocal argument.

sufficient for the open-loop solvability of the problem. By considering a
family of uniformly convex cost functionals, a characterization of the
finiteness of the problem is derived and a minimizing sequence, whose
convergence is equivalent to the open-loop solvability of the problem, is
constructed. Then, it is proved that the uniform convexity of the cost
