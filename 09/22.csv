$\Omega_K^{(0)}$ in the null test relation. The null test is totally
geometrical and without assuming any cosmological model. We show that the
cosmic curvature $\Omega_K^{(0)}=0$ is consistent with current observational
data sets, falling within the $1\sigma$ limit. To demonstrate the effect on the

that are beyond the reach of the individual non interacting elements, are
always of great interest in physics. Quantum collective effects that have no
classical analogue are even more intriguing. In this work we show how to
construct collective quantum heat machines and explore their performance boosts
with respect to regular machines. Without interactions between the machines the
individual units operate in a stochastic, non-quantum manner. The construction
of the collective machine becomes possible by introducing two simple quantum
operations: coherence extraction and coherence injection. Together these
operations can harvest coherence from one engine and use it to boost the
performance of a slightly different engine. For weakly driven engines we show
that the collective work output scales quadratically with the number of engines
rather than linearly. Eventually, the boost saturates and the scaling becomes
linear. Nevertheless, even in saturation, work is still significantly boosted
compared to individual operation. To study the reversibility of the collective
machine we introduce the 'entropy pollution' measure. It is shown that there is
a regime where the collective machine is N times more reversible while
producing N times more work, compared to the individual operation of N units.
Moreover, the collective machine can even be more reversible than the most
reversible unit in the collective. This high level of reversibility becomes
possible due to a special symbiotic mechanism between engine pairs.

direction of arrival (DOA) of a narrowband signal impinging on a sensor array
from the far field. The initial estimate is made using a Bayesian compressive
sensing (BCS) framework and then tracked using a Bayesian compressed sensing
Kalman filter (BCSKF). The BCS framework splits the angular region into N
potential DOAs and enforces a belief that only a few of the DOAs will have a
non-zero valued signal present. A BCSKF can then be used to track the change in
the DOA using the same framework. There can be an issue when the DOA approaches
the endfire of the array. In this angular region current methods can struggle
to accurately estimate and track changes in the DOAs. To tackle this problem,
we propose changing the traditional sparse belief associated with BCS to a
belief that the estimated signals will match the predicted signals given a
known DOA change. This is done by modelling the difference between the expected
sparse received signals and the estimated sparse received signals as a Gaussian
distribution. Example test scenarios are provided and comparisons made with the
traditional BCS based estimation method. They show that an improvement in
estimation accuracy is possible without a significant increase in computational
complexity.

features of cell cycle and proliferation, cell damage and repair, and chemical

with cells stepping along a sequence of discrete internal states from 'normal'

can undergo during its life cycle: duplication, arrest, apoptosis, senescence,
damage, healing. We adjust the model parameters on a series of cell irradiation
experiments, carried out in a clinical LINAC at 20 MV, in which the damage and
repair kinetics of single- and double-strand breaks are followed. Two showcase
applications of the model are then presented. In the first one, we reconstruct
the cell survival curves from a number of published low- and high-dose
irradiation experiments. We reobtain a very good description of the data
without assuming the well-known linear-quadratic model, but instead including a
variable DSB repair probability, which is found to spontaneously saturate with
an exponential decay at increasingly high doses. As a second test, we attempt

epoch. The blueshift generator for a single GRB is a region with a nonconstant
bang-time function $t_B(r)$ (described by a Lema\^{\i}tre -- Tolman (L--T)
exact solution of Einstein's equations) matched into a homogeneous and
isotropic (Friedmann) background. Blueshift visible to the present observer
arises \textit{only on those rays that are emitted radially in an L--T region}.
The paper presents three L--T models with different Big Bang profiles, adapted
for the highest and the lowest end of the GRB frequency range. The models
account for: (1) The observed frequency range of the GRBs; (2) Their limited
duration; (3) The afterglows; (4) Their hypothetical collimation into narrow

qualitatively. With a small correction of the parameters of the model, the
implied perturbations of the CMB radiation will be consistent with those

many L--T regions with different $t_B(r)$ profiles, matched into the same
Friedmann background. This paper is meant to be an initial exploration of the
possibilities offered by models of this kind; the actual fitting of all

try to suppress the bath effects by means of dynamical control, but such
control does not always yield the desired results. We wish instead to take
advantage of bath effects, that do not obliterate ""quantumness"" in the
system-bath compound. To this end, three possible approaches have been pursued
by us: (i) Control of a quantum system faster than the correlation time of the
bath to which it couples: Such control allows us to reveal
quasi-reversible/coherent dynamical phenomena of quantum open systems, manifest
by the quantum Zeno or anti-Zeno effects (QZE or AZE, respectively). Dynamical
control methods based on the QZE are aimed not only at protecting the
quantumness of the system, but also diagnosing the bath spectra or transferring
quantum information via noisy media. By contrast, AZE-based control is useful
for fast cooling of thermalized quantum systems. (ii) Engineering the coupling
of quantum systems to selected bath modes: This approach, based on field -atom
coupling control in cavities, waveguides and photonic band structures, allows
to drastically enhance the strength and range of atom-atom coupling through the
mediation of the selected bath modes. More dramatically, it allows us to
achieve bath-induced entanglement that may appear paradoxical if one takes the
conventional view that coupling to baths destroys quantumness. (iii)
Engineering baths with appropriate non-flat spectra: This approach is a
prerequisite for the construction of the simplest and most efficient quantum
heat machines (engines and refrigerators). We may thus conclude that often
thermal baths are ""more friends than foes"" in quantum technologies.

classification decision and allow a visualization in terms of a heatmap in
pixel/input space. While the usefulness of heatmaps can be judged subjectively
by a human, an objective quality measure is missing. In this paper we present a
general methodology based on region perturbation for evaluating ordered
collections of pixels such as heatmaps. We compare heatmaps computed by three
different methods on the SUN397, ILSVRC2012 and MIT Places data sets. Our main
result is that the recently proposed Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively provides a better explanation of
what made a DNN arrive at a particular classification decision than the
sensitivity-based approach or the deconvolution method. We provide theoretical
arguments to explain this result and discuss its practical implications.
Finally, we investigate the use of heatmaps for unsupervised assessment of

understanding of the dynamics of jets and planetary scale waves requires
adopting the perspective of statistical state dynamics (SSD) which comprises
the dynamics of the interaction between coherent and incoherent components in
the turbulent state. In this work the S3T implementation of SSD for barotropic
beta-plane turbulence is used to develop a theory for the jet/wave coexistence
regime by separating the coherent motions consisting of the zonal jets together
with a selection of large-scale waves from the smaller scale motions which
constitute the incoherent component. It is found that mean flow/turbulence
interaction gives rise to jets that coexist with large-scale coherent waves in
a synergistic manner. Large-scale waves that would only exist as damped modes
in the laminar jet are found to be transformed into exponentially growing waves
by interaction with the incoherent small scale turbulence which results in a
change in the mode structure allowing the mode to tap the energy of the mean
jet. This mechanism of destabilization differs fundamentally and serves to
augment the more familiar S3T instabilities in which jets and waves arise from
homogeneous turbulence with energy source exclusively from the incoherent eddy
field and provides further insight into the cooperative dynamics of the
jet/waves coexistence regime in planetary turbulence.

  Measurements",,,,,"cs.NI cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the capability of localizing node failures in communication
networks from binary states (normal/failed) of end-to-end paths. Given a set of
nodes of interest, uniquely localizing failures within this set requires that
different observable path states associate with different node failure events.
However, this condition is difficult to test on large networks due to the need
to enumerate all possible node failures. Our first contribution is a set of
sufficient/necessary conditions for identifying a bounded number of failures
within an arbitrary node set that can be tested in polynomial time. In addition
to network topology and locations of monitors, our conditions also incorporate
constraints imposed by the probing mechanism used. We consider three probing
mechanisms that differ according to whether measurement paths are (i)
arbitrarily controllable, (ii) controllable but cycle-free, or (iii)
uncontrollable (determined by the default routing protocol). Our second
contribution is to quantify the capability of failure localization through (1)
the maximum number of failures (anywhere in the network) such that failures
within a given node set can be uniquely localized, and (2) the largest node set
within which failures can be uniquely localized under a given bound on the
total number of failures. Both measures in (1-2) can be converted into
functions of a per-node property, which can be computed efficiently based on
the above sufficient/necessary conditions. We demonstrate how measures (1-2)
proposed for quantifying failure localization capability can be used to
evaluate the impact of various parameters, including topology, number of
monitors, and probing mechanisms.

smallest possible total perturbation energy density $E_c$ that trigger
turbulence from the laminar state, in stably stratified plane Couette flow
using the `direct-adjoint-looping' (DAL) method for finding nonlinear optimal
perturbations that optimise the time averaged total dissipation of energy in
the flow. These minimal seeds are located adjacent to the edge manifold, the
manifold in state space that separates trajectories which transition to
turbulence from those which eventually decay to the laminar state. The edge
manifold is also the stable manifold of the system's `edge state'. The
trajectories from the minimal seed initial conditions spend a large amount of
time in the vicinity of some states: the edge state; another state contained
within the edge manifold; or even in dynamically slowly varying regions of the
edge manifold, allowing us to investigate the effects of a stable
stratification on any coherent structures associated with such states. In
unstratified plane Couette flow, these coherent structures are manifestations
of the self-sustaining process (SSP) deduced on physical grounds by Waleffe
(1997), or equivalently finite Reynolds number solutions of the vortex-wave
interaction (VWI) asymptotic equations initially derived mathematically by Hall
& Smith (1991). The stratified coherent states we identify at moderate $Re$
display an altered form from their unstratified counterparts for bulk
Richardson numbers $Ri_B=\textit{O}(Re^{-1})$, and exhibit chaotic motion for
larger $Ri_B$. We demonstrate that at high $Re$ the suppression of vertical
motions by stratification strongly disrupts input from the waves to the roll
velocity structures, thus preventing the waves from reinforcing the viscously
decaying roll structures adequately, when $Ri_B=\textit{O}(Re^{-2})$.

response of the low solar atmosphere to primary energy released during flares.
At present the infrared continuum has been detected at 30 THz (10 $\mu$m) in
only a few flares. In this work we present a detailed multi-frequency analysis
of SOL2012-03-13, including observations at radio millimeter and sub-millimeter
wavelengths, in hard X-rays (HXR), gamma-rays (GR), H-alpha, and white-light.
HXR/GR spectral analysis shows that the event is a GR line flare and allows
estimating the numbers of and energy contents in electrons, protons and alpha
particles produced during the flare. The energy spectrum of the electrons
producing the HXR/GR continuum is consistent with a broken power-law with an
energy break at ~800 keV. It is shown that the high-energy part (above ~800
keV) of this distribution is responsible for the high-frequency radio emission
(> 20 GHz) detected during the flare. By comparing the 30 THz emission expected
from semi-empirical and time-independent models of the quiet and flare
atmospheres, we find that most (~80%) of the observed 30 THz radiation can be
attributed to thermal free-free emission of an optically-thin source. Using the
F2 flare atmospheric model this thin source is found to be at temperatures
T~8000 K and is located well above the minimum temperature region. We argue
that the chromospheric heating, which results in 80% of the 30 THz excess
radiation, can be due to energy deposition by non-thermal flare accelerated
electrons, protons and alpha particles. The remaining 20% of the 30 THz excess
emission is found to be radiated from an optically-thick atmospheric layer at
T~5000 K, below the temperature minimum region, where direct heating by
non-thermal particles is insufficient to account for the observed infrared
radiation.

behavioural patterns resulting from human or animal decisions is fundamental
for deconvolving cognition and designing autonomous artificial intelligence
systems. Yet complexity is difficult in practice, particularly when strings are
short. By numerically approximating algorithmic (Kolmogorov) complexity (K), we
establish an objective tool to characterise behavioural complexity. Next, we
approximate structural (Bennett's Logical Depth) complexity (LD) to assess the
amount of computation required for generating a behavioural string. We apply
our toolbox to three landmark studies of animal behaviour of increasing
sophistication and degree of environmental influence, including studies of
foraging communication by ants, flight patterns of fruit flies, and tactical
deception and competition (e.g., predator-prey) strategies. We find that ants
harness the environmental condition in their internal decision process,
modulating their behavioural complexity accordingly. Our analysis of flight
(fruit flies) invalidated the common hypothesis that animals navigating in an
environment devoid of stimuli adopt a random strategy. Fruit flies exposed to a
featureless environment deviated the most from Levy flight, suggesting an
algorithmic bias in their attempt to devise a useful (navigation) strategy.
Similarly, a logical depth analysis of rats revealed that the structural
complexity of the rat always ends up matching the structural complexity of the
competitor, with the rats' behaviour simulating algorithmic randomness.
Finally, we discuss how experiments on how humans perceive randomness suggest
the existence of an algorithmic bias in our reasoning and decision processes,
in line with our analysis of the animal experiments.

presence of weak axial magnetic field are prone to a new nonlinear explosive
instability. The latter occurs due to the near-resonance three-wave
interactions of a magnetorotational instability with stable Alfven-Coriolis and
magnetosonic modes. The dynamical equations that govern the temporal evolution
of the amplitudes of the three interacting modes are derived. Numerical
solutions of the dynamical equations indicate that small frequency mismatch
gives rise to two types of behavior: 1. explosive instability which leads to
infinite values of the three amplitudes within a finite time, and 2. bounded
irregular oscillations of all three amplitudes. Asymptotic solutions of the
dynamical equations are obtained for the explosive instability regimes and are
shown to match the numerical solutions near the explosion time.

the HJ equation for the value of the minimal area, without calculating the

asymptotically AdS. For the rectangular countour, the HJ equation, which is
separable, can be solved exactly. For the circular countour an expansion in
powers of the radius is implemented. The HJ approach naturally leads to a
regularization which consists in locating the countour away from the border.
The results are compared with other regularization which leaves the countour at
the border and calculates the area of the corresponding minimal surface up to a
diameter smaller than the one of the countour at the border. The results do not

understand the formation and evolution of stars, we need to analyse their
observed spectra. Analysing a spectrum of a star requires information about the
properties of atomic lines, such as wavelengths and oscillator strengths.
However, atomic data of some elements are scarce, particularly in the infrared
region, and this paper is part of an effort to improve the situation on near-IR
atomic data. Aims. This paper investigates the spectrum of neutral scandium, Sc
i, from laboratory measurements and improves the atomic data of Sc i lines in
the infrared region covering lines in R, I, J, and K bands. Especially, we
focus on measuring oscillator strengths for Sc i lines connecting the levels
with 4p and 4s configurations. Methods. We combined experimental branching
fractions with radiative lifetimes from the literature to derive oscillator
strengths (f - values). Intensity-calibrated spectra with high spectral
resolution were recorded with Fourier transform spectrometer from a hollow

strengths and wavelengths for Sc i lines, with emphasis on the infrared region.
Results. This project provides the first set of experimental Sc i lines in the
near-infrared region for accurate spectral analysis of astronomical objects. We
derived 63 log(g f ) values for the lines between 5300{\AA} and 24300{\AA}. The
uncertainties in the f -values vary from 5% to 20%. The small uncertainties in
our values allow for an increased accuracy in astrophysical abundance

different growth conditions has been investigated for crystals grown by the
flux method. We find that the magnetic response depends very sensitively on the
details of the growth conditions. We assess the defect concentration based on
magnetization, X-ray diffraction, Raman scattering, and optical conductivity
measurements. We find that samples with a low concentration of electronically
active defects show much reduced in-gap spectral weight in the optical
conductivity and a pronounced two-magnon peak in the Raman scattering spectrum.
A prolonged exposure at high temperature during the growth leads to higher
defect concentration likely due to creation of oxygen vacancies. We further
demonstrate a systematic intergrowth of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$
phases by varying the growth temperature. Our results thus emphasize that
revealing the intrinsic magnetic properties of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and related

classical thermodynamical formalism and to ergodic transport. First, we discuss
how Elton's theorem can be used to characterise Gibbs measures for expanding
maps. Such characterisation will be done by constructing a stochastic process,
defined by a iterated function system (IFS), whose empirical measure converges
to the Gibbs measure, in the sense that the mean of any test function evaluated
in the outcomes of this stochastic process converges to the integral of such
test function with respect to the Gibbs measure. In this way we present a
stochastic algorithm that compute integrals of functions. After this, we turn
our attention to ergodic transport: given two sets $X$ and $\Omega$, a measure
$\mu$ on $X$ and a dynamics $T$ on $\Omega$, we consider the set of probability
measures on $X \times \Omega$ whose projections on the second coordinate are
$T$-invariant, while the projections on the first coordinate are $\mu$. Such
measures are called transport plans. We call Gibbs plan any transport plan that
maximizes a pressure functional that is defined by a potential function added
to an entropy term. As in the classical thermodynamical formalism case, we
adapt Elton's theorem to define a stochastic process (using a IFS) whose
empirical measures converges to the Gibbs plan. We provide examples and show
explicitly calculations in the case where $X$ has two elements and the cost
function depends on the two first coordinates of $\Omega$.

  (2017)",,,"cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a square root map on Sturmian words and study its properties.
Given a Sturmian word of slope $\alpha$, there exists exactly six minimal
squares in its language (a minimal square does not have a square as a proper
prefix). A Sturmian word $s$ of slope $\alpha$ can be written as a product of
these six minimal squares: $s = X_1^2 X_2^2 X_3^2 \cdots$. The square root of
$s$ is defined to be the word $\sqrt{s} = X_1 X_2 X_3 \cdots$. The main result
of this paper is that that $\sqrt{s}$ is also a Sturmian word of slope
$\alpha$. Further, we characterize the Sturmian fixed points of the square root
map, and we describe how to find the intercept of $\sqrt{s}$ and an occurrence
of any prefix of $\sqrt{s}$ in $s$. Related to the square root map, we
characterize the solutions of the word equation $X_1^2 X_2^2 \cdots X_n^2 =
(X_1 X_2 \cdots X_n)^2$ in the language of Sturmian words of slope $\alpha$
where the words $X_i^2$ are minimal squares of slope $\alpha$.
  We also study the square root map in a more general setting. We explicitly
construct an infinite set of non-Sturmian fixed points of the square root map.
We show that the subshifts $\Omega$ generated by these words have a curious
property: for all $w \in \Omega$ either $\sqrt{w} \in \Omega$ or $\sqrt{w}$ is
periodic. In particular, the square root map can map an aperiodic word to a
periodic word.

dearth of models and methods that account for within-group spectral
variability. This article proposes a model for groups of time series in which
transfer functions are modeled as stochastic variables that can account for
both between-group and within-group differences in spectra that are identified
from individual replicates. An ensuing discriminant analysis of stochastic
cepstra under this model is developed to obtain parsimonious measures of
relative power that optimally separate groups in the presence of within-group

new observations and can be consistently estimated through a simple
discriminant analysis of a finite number of estimated cepstral coefficients.
Benefits in accounting for within-group spectral variability are empirically
illustrated in a simulation study and through an analysis of gait variability.

matches the square root of the current best known bound for the randomized

While we can examine the motion
of dark matter subhalos around their hosts in simulations of structure
formation, determining the orbits of satellites around their parent galaxies
from observations is impossible except for a small number of nearby cases. In
this work we outline a novel approach to probing the orbital distributions of
infalling satellite galaxies using the morphology of tidal debris structures.
It has long been understood that the destruction of satellites on near-radial
orbits tends to lead to the formation of shells of debris, while those on less
eccentric orbits produce tidal streams. We combine an understanding of the
scaling relations governing the orbital properties of debris with a simple
model of how these orbits phase-mix over time to produce a `morphology metric'
that more rigorously quantifies the conditions required for shells to be
apparent in debris structures as a function of the satellite's mass and orbit
and the interaction time. Using this metric we demonstrate how differences in
orbit distributions can alter the relative frequency of shells and stream
structures observed around galaxies. These experiments suggest that more
detailed modeling and careful comparisons with current and future surveys of
low surface brightness features around nearby galaxies should be capable of
actually constraining orbital distributions and provide new insights into our
understanding of structure formation.

energy deposition (via, e.g., unstable fusion, wave heating, or a binary
companion) heats a region near the stellar surface. This appears to occur in
luminous blue variables (LBVs), Type IIn supernovae progenitors, classical
novae, and X-ray bursts. We show that when the wind kinetic power exceeds
Eddington, the photons are trapped and behave like a fluid. Convection does not
play a significant role in the wind energy transport. The wind properties
depend on the ratio of a characteristic speed in the problem vc ~ (Edot
G)^{1/5} (where Edot is the heating rate) to the stellar escape speed near the
heating region vesc(r_h). For vc > vesc(r_h) the wind kinetic power at large
radii Edot_w ~ Edot. For vc < vesc(r_h), most of the energy is used to unbind
the wind material and thus Edot_w < Edot. Multidimensional hydrodynamic
simulations without radiation diffusion using FLASH and one-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations with radiation diffusion using MESA are in good
agreement with the analytic predictions. The photon luminosity from the wind is
itself super-Eddington but in many cases the photon luminosity is likely
dominated by `internal shocks' in the wind. We discuss the application of our
models to eruptive mass loss from massive stars and argue that the wind models
described here can account for the broad properties of LBV outflows and the
enhanced mass loss in the years prior to Type IIn core-collapse supernovae.

caused by elevated star formation rates (SFRs) is expected to play an important
role in this evolution. We compare different outflow prescriptions: (i)
constant wind velocity (CW), (ii) variable wind scaling with galaxy properties
(VW), and (iii) no outflows (NW). The overdensity leads to accelerated
evolution of dark matter and baryonic structures, absent in the ""normal""
region, and to shallow galaxy stellar mass functions at the low-mass end.
Although CW shows little dependence on both environments, the more physically
motivated VW model does exhibit this effect. In addition, VW can reproduce the
observed specific SFR (sSFR) and the sSFR-stellar mass relation, which CW and
NW fail to satisfy simultaneously. Winds also differ substantially in affecting
the state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The difference lies in
volume-filling factor of hot, high-metallicity gas which is near unity for CW,
while it remains confined in massive filaments for VW, and locked up in
galaxies for NW. Such gas is nearly absent in the normal region. Although all
wind models suffer from deficiencies, the VW model seems to be promising in
correlating the outflow properties to those of host galaxies. Further
constraints on the state of the IGM at high-$z$ are needed to separate
different wind models.

single photons become weaker in the infrared. By contrast, we find that a
photon satisfying the WGC will not necessarily satisfy it after toroidal
compactification when black holes charged under the Kaluza-Klein photons are
considered. Doing so either requires an infinite number of states of different
charges to satisfy the WGC in the original theory or a restriction on allowed
compactification radii. These subtleties suggest that if the Weak Gravity
Conjecture is true, we must seek a stronger form of the conjecture that is
robust under compactification. We propose a ""Lattice Weak Gravity Conjecture""
that meets this requirement: a superextremal particle should exist for every
charge in the charge lattice. The perturbative heterotic string satisfies this
conjecture. We also use compactification to explore the extent to which the WGC
applies to axions. We argue that gravitational instanton solutions in theories
of axions coupled to dilaton-like fields are analogous to extremal black holes,
motivating a WGC for axions. This is further supported by a match between the
instanton action and that of wrapped black branes in a higher-dimensional UV

dependent on the distance to the nearest filament. Our analysis demonstrates
that a red galaxy or a high-mass galaxy tend to reside closer to filaments than
a blue or low-mass galaxy. After adjusting the effect from stellar mass, on
average, early-forming galaxies or large galaxies have a shorter distance to
filaments than late-forming galaxies or small galaxies. For the Main galaxy
sample (MGS), all signals are very significant ($>6\sigma$). For the LOWZ and

500-1000 Msun/yr at z=2-3, by which time the interstellar medium is
sufficiently enriched with metals that the region may be observed as a
submillimetre-selected system. The intense star formation rates are fueled in
part by a reservoir gas supply enabled by stellar feedback at earlier times,
not through major mergers. With a duty cycle of nearly a gigayear, our
simulations show that the submillimetre-luminous phase of high-z galaxies is a
drawn out one that is associated with significant mass buildup in early
Universe proto-clusters, and that many submillimetre-luminous galaxies are
actually composed of numerous unresolved components (for which there is some
observational evidence).

we present a novel approach to couple two spin qubits via a superconducting

the same software, Starlink, but differ in their choice of data reduction
parameters. We find that the JCMT LR1 reduction is suitable for determining
whether or not compact emission is present in a given region and the GBS LR1
reduction is tuned in a robust way to uncover more extended emission, which
better serves more in-depth physical analyses of star-forming regions. Using
the GBS LR1 method, we find that compact sources are recovered well, even at a
peak brightness of only 3 times the noise, whereas the reconstruction of larger
objects requires much care when drawing boundaries around the expected
astronomical signal in the data reduction process. Incorrect boundaries can
lead to false structure identification or it can cause structure to be missed.
In the JCMT LR1 reduction, the extent of the true structure of objects larger

schema mappings specified by source-to-target GAV dependencies and target
equality-generating dependencies (egds), the XR-certain answers of a target
conjunctive query can be rewritten as the consistent answers (in the sense of
standard database repairs) of a union of conjunctive queries over the source

to use a consistent query-answering system to compute XR-certain answers in

frequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. This spectral range
is well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphology
caused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emission
altitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellar
medium, respectively. The magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidly
towards low frequencies. LOFAR can thus address a number of open questions
about the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through the
interstellar medium. We present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsars
observed in the two LOFAR frequency bands: High Band (120-167 MHz, 100
profiles) and Low Band (15-62 MHz, 26 profiles). We compare them with
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) and Lovell Telescope observations
at higher frequencies (350 and1400 MHz) in order to study the profile
evolution. The profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new set
of timing solutions from the Lovell Telescope, which we present along with
precise dispersion measures obtained with LOFAR. We find that the profile
evolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,
depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or be
hidden from, view. Nonetheless, in general our observations confirm the
widening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected from
radius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. We offer this catalog of
low-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the EPN Database of

12,288 MultiDark PATCHY BOSS (DR11) DR12 light-cones corresponding to an
effective volume of $\sim192,000\,[h^{-1}\,{\rm Gpc}]^3$ (the largest ever

to 0.75. The mocks have been calibrated using a reference galaxy catalogue
based on the halo abundance matching modelling of the BOSS DR11&DR12 galaxy
clustering data and on the data themselves. The production follows three steps.
First, we apply the PATCHY code to generate a dark matter field and an object
distribution including nonlinear stochastic galaxy bias. Secondly, we run the
halo/stellar distribution reconstruction HADRON code to assign masses to the
various objects. This step uses the mass distribution as a function of local
density and non-local indicators (i.e., tidal field tensor eigenvalues and
relative halo exclusion separation for massive objects) from the reference
simulation applied to the corresponding PATCHY dark matter and galaxy
distribution. Finally, we apply the SUGAR code to build the light cones. The
resulting MultiDark PATCHY mock light cones reproduce the number density,
selection function, survey geometry, and in general within 1 $\sigma$, for
arbitrary stellar mass bins, the power spectrum up to $k=0.3\,h\,{\rm

$\Lambda$CDM Planck cosmology. We compare the observational data with the
simulated ones on a light-cone constructed from 20 subsequent outputs of the
simulation. Observational effects such as incompleteness, geometry, veto masks
and fiber collisions are included in the model, which reproduces within
1-$\sigma$ errors the observed monopole of the 2-point correlation function at
all relevant scales: from the smallest scales, 0.5 $h^{-1}$ Mpc, up to scales
beyond the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation feature. This model also agrees
remarkably well with the BOSS galaxy power spectrum (up to $k\sim1$ $h$
Mpc$^{-1}$), and the Three-point correlation function. The quadrupole of the
correlation function presents some tensions with observations. We discuss
possible causes that can explain this disagreement, including target selection
effects. Overall, the standard HAM model describes remarkably well the
clustering statistics of the CMASS sample. We compare the stellar to halo mass
relation for the CMASS sample measured using weak lensing in the CFHT Stripe 82

and the first of the newly defined class of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe).
The extraordinary energetics of SN 2006gy and all SLSNe (>10^51 erg) require
either atypically large explosion energies (e.g., pair-instability explosion)
or the efficient conversion of kinetic into radiative energy (e.g., shock
interaction). The mass-loss characteristics can therefore offer important clues
regarding the progenitor system. For the case of SN 2006gy, both a scattered
and thermal light echo from circumstellar material (CSM) have been reported at
later epochs (day ~800), ruling out the likelihood of a pair-instability event
and leading to constraints on the characteristics of the CSM. Owing to the
proximity of the SN to the bright host-galaxy nucleus, continued monitoring of
the light echo has not been trivial, requiring the high resolution offered by
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) or ground-based adaptive optics (AO). Here we
report detections of SN 2006gy using HST and Keck AO at ~3000 days
post-explosion and consider the emission mechanism for the very late-time light
curve. While the optical light curve and optical spectral energy distribution
are consistent with a continued scattered-light echo, a thermal echo is
insufficient to power the K'-band emission by day 3000. Instead, we present
evidence for late-time infrared emission from dust that is radiatively heated
by CSM interaction within an extremely dense dust shell, and we consider the
implications on the CSM characteristics and progenitor system.

study of the low energy magnetic excitation spectrum of Sr2IrO4 and doped
Eu-doped Sr2IrO4 as functions of both temperature and applied magnetic field.
We show that the high-field (H>1.5 T) in-plane spin dynamics of Sr2IrO4 are
isotropic and governed by the interplay between the applied field and the small
in-plane ferromagnetic spin components induced by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya

exhibit important effects associated with interlayer coupling and in-plane
anisotropy, including a spin-flop transition at Hc in Sr2IrO4 that occurs
either discontinuously or via a continuous rotation of the spins, depending
upon the in-plane orientation of the applied field. These results show that
in-plane anisotropy and interlayer coupling effects play important roles in the

thermodynamics. In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of
ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we
present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and
some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of
energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables.
Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe
thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an
external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from
studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench
as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results
of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review
explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic
thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of
thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems,
and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum
chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian
eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles.
We then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal
energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review,
we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of
integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We introduce the concept
of the generalized Gibbs ensemble, and discuss its connection with ideas of
prethermalization in weakly interacting systems.

planetesimal belt, we detect thermal emission from AU Mic's halo for the first
time. In contrast to the scattered light images, no asymmetries are evident in
the disk. The fractional luminosity of the disk is $3.9 \times 10^{-4}$ and its
mm-grain dust mass is 0.01 MEarth (+/- 20%). We create a simple spatial model
that reconciles the disk SED as a blackbody of 53 +/- 2 K (a composite of 39
and 50 K components) and the presence of small (non-blackbody) grains which
populate the extended halo. The best fit model is consistent with the ""birth
ring"" model explored in earlier works, i.e., an edge-on dust belt extending
from 8.8-40 AU, but with an additional halo component with an $r^{-1.5}$
surface density profile extending to the limits of sensitivity (140 AU). We
confirm that AU Mic does not exert enough radiation force to blow out grains.
For stellar mass loss rates of 10-100x solar, compact (zero porosity) grains
can only be removed if they are very small, consistently with previous work, if
the porosity is 0.9, then grains approaching 0.1 micron can be removed via
corpuscular forces (i.e., the stellar wind).

could be explained by the presence of energetic particles accelerated within
young protostars. Our modelling consists of a set of conditions that has to be
satisfied in order to have an efficient particle acceleration through the
diffusive shock acceleration mechanism. We find that jet shocks can be strong
accelerators of protons which can be boosted up to relativistic energies.
Another possibly efficient acceleration site is located at protostellar
surfaces, where shocks caused by impacting material during the collapse phase
are strong enough to accelerate protons. Our results demonstrate the
possibility of accelerating particles during the early phase of a
proto-Solar-like system and can be used as an argument to support available
observations. The existence of an internal source of energetic particles can
have a strong and unforeseen impact on the star and planet formation process as
well as on the formation of pre-biotic molecules.

properties besides mass, a phenomenon referred to as halo assembly bias. Using
the depth of the gravitational potential well, $V_{\rm max}$, as our secondary
halo property, in this paper we present the first study of the scale-dependence
assembly bias. In the large-scale linear regime, $r\geq10h^{-1}{\rm Mpc},$ our
findings are in keeping with previous results. In particular, at the low-mass
end ($M_{\rm vir}<M_{\rm coll}\approx10^{12.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$), halos with
high-$V_{\rm max}$ show stronger large-scale clustering relative to halos with
low-$V_{\rm max}$ of the same mass, this trend weakens and reverses for $M_{\rm
vir}\geq M_{\rm coll}.$ In the nonlinear regime, assembly bias in low-mass
halos exhibits a pronounced scale-dependent ""bump"" at $500h^{-1}{\rm
kpc}-5h^{-1}{\rm Mpc},$ a new result. This feature weakens and eventually
vanishes for halos of higher mass. We show that this scale-dependent signature
can primarily be attributed to a special subpopulation of ejected halos,
defined as present-day host halos that were previously members of a higher-mass
halo at some point in their past history. A corollary of our results is that
galaxy clustering on scales of $r\sim1-2h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ can be impacted by up
to $\sim15\%$ by the choice of the halo property used in the halo model, even
for stellar mass-limited samples.

stochastic block model, where observations are collected in the form of a
weighted adjacency matrix, and the weight of each edge is generated
independently from a distribution determined by the community membership of its
endpoints. Our main result, characterizing the precise boundary between success
and failure of maximum likelihood estimation when edge weights are drawn from
discrete distributions, involves the Renyi divergence of order $\frac{1}{2}$
between the distributions of within-community and between-community edges. When
the Renyi divergence is above a certain threshold, meaning the edge
distributions are sufficiently separated, maximum likelihood succeeds with
probability tending to 1; when the Renyi divergence is below the threshold,
maximum likelihood fails with probability bounded away from 0. In the language
of graphical channels, the Renyi divergence pinpoints the information-theoretic
capacity of discrete graphical channels with binary inputs. Our results
generalize previously established thresholds derived specifically for
unweighted block models, and support an important natural intuition relating
the intrinsic hardness of community estimation to the problem of edge
classification. Along the way, we establish a general relationship between the
Renyi divergence and the probability of success of the maximum likelihood
estimator for arbitrary edge weight distributions. Finally, we discuss
consequences of our bounds for the related problems of censored block models
and submatrix localization, which may be seen as special cases of the framework
developed in our paper.

It is based on a potential formulation for acoustic radiation on weakly

solution is formulated using a Green's function obtained by combining the
Taylor and Lorentz transformations. Although most conventional approaches based

assess the accuracy of the integral solution. It is tested as a means of
extrapolating a numerical solution available on the outer boundary of a domain

surfaces in non-uniform flows. The results show that the error associated with
the physical model deteriorates with increasing frequency and mean flow Mach

computational paths and categorical semantics, we take any type $A$ of type

fundamental groupoid of a type $A$, since it is similar to the one obtained
using the homotopical interpretation of the identity type. The main difference
is that instead of being just a semantical interpretation, computational paths
are entities of the syntax of type theory. We also expand our results, using
computational paths to construct fundamental groupoids of higher levels.

interact strongly via the Coulomb interaction and thus non-perturbative methods

effective theory in the presence of an external magnetic field. Graphene, along

problem arising in earlier studies of network analysis. Its simplest
formulation is in two steps: (1) We cut every edge of G into two halves, thus
obtaining a collection of n=|V| one-vertex components. (2) We splice the two
halves of every edge together, not of all the edges at once, but in some
ordering \Theta of the edges that minimizes two measures that depend on the
edge-boundary degrees of assembled components.
  The edge-boundary degree of a component A (subset of V) is the number of
edges in G with one endpoint in A and one endpoint in V-A. We call the maximum
edge-boundary degree encountered during the reassembling process the
alpha-measure of the reassembling, and the sum of all edge-boundary degrees is
its beta-measure. The alpha-optimization (resp. beta-optimization) of the
reassembling of G is to determine an order \Theta for splicing the edges that
minimizes its alpha-measure (resp. beta-measure).
  There are different forms of reassembling. We consider only cases satisfying
the condition that if the an edge between disjoint components A and B is
spliced, then all the edges between A and B are spliced at the same time. In
this report, we examine the particular case of linear reassembling, which
requires that the next edge to be spliced must be adjacent to an already
spliced edge. We delay other forms of reassembling to follow-up reports.
  We prove that alpha-optimization of linear reassembling and minimum-cutwidth
linear arrangment (CutWidth) are polynomially reducible to each other, and that
beta-optimization of linear reassembling and minimum-cost linear arrangement
(MinArr) are polynomially reducible to each other.

SCMS is a gradient-based method that detects filaments through density ridges
(smooth curves tracing high-density regions). A great advantage of SCMS is its
uncertainty measure, which allows an evaluation of the errors for the detected
filaments. To detect filaments, we use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
which consist of three galaxy samples: the NYU main galaxy sample (MGS), the
LOWZ sample and the CMASS sample. Each of the three dataset covers different
redshift regions so that the combined sample allows detection of filaments up
to z = 0.7. Our filament catalogue consists of a sequence of two-dimensional
filament maps at different redshifts that provide several useful statistics on
the evolution cosmic web. To construct the maps, we select spectroscopically
confirmed galaxies within 0.050 < z < 0.700 and partition them into 130 bins.
For each bin, we ignore the redshift, treating the galaxy observations as a 2-D
data and detect filaments using SCMS. The filament catalogue consists of 130
individual 2-D filament maps, and each map comprises points on the detected
filaments that describe the filamentary structures at a particular redshift. We
also apply our filament catalogue to investigate galaxy luminosity and its
relation with distance to filament. Using a volume-limited sample, we find
strong evidence (6.1$\sigma$ - 12.3$\sigma$) that galaxies close to filaments
are generally brighter than those at significant distance from filaments.

systems can also evolve over time responding to changes in the dynamical states
of the elements. Link adaptation inspired by Hebbian learning, the dominant
paradigm for neuronal plasticity, has been earlier shown to result in
structural balance by removing any initial frustration in a system that arises
through conflicting interactions. Here we show that the rate of the adaptive
dynamics for the interactions is crucial in deciding the emergence of different
ordering behavior (including chimera) and frustration in networks of Ising
spins. In particular, we observe that small changes in the link adaptation rate
about a critical value result in the system exhibiting radically different
energy landscapes, viz., smooth landscape corresponding to balanced systems
seen for fast learning, and rugged landscapes corresponding to frustrated
systems seen for slow learning.

sets, where traditional methods are no longer tenable. Our methods rely on
stochastic approximations, which are computationally efficient as they maintain
one iterate as a parameter estimate, and successively update that iterate based
on a single data point. When the update is based on a noisy gradient, the
stochastic approximation is known as standard stochastic gradient descent,
which has been fundamental in modern applications with large data sets.
Additionally, our methods are numerically stable because they employ implicit
updates of the iterates. Intuitively, an implicit update is a shrinked version
of a standard one, where the shrinkage factor depends on the observed Fisher
information at the corresponding data point. This shrinkage prevents numerical
divergence of the iterates, which can be caused either by excess noise or
outliers. Our sgd package in R offers the most extensive and robust

Nonstandard Mordell-Weil property is equivalent to weak Mordell-Weil property

Magellanic Cloud. We used new data from XMM-Newton to characterise the X-ray
emission and data from the Australian Telescope Compact Array, the Magellanic
Cloud Emission Line Survey, and Spitzer to gain a picture of the environment
into which the remnant is expanding. We performed a morphological study,
determined radio polarisation and magnetic field orientation, and performed an
X-ray spectral analysis. We estimated the its size to be 24.9 (\pm1.5) x 21.9
(\pm1.5) pc, with the major axis rotated ~29 deg east of north. Radio
polarisation at 3 cm and 6 cm indicate a higher degree of polarisation in the
NW and SE tangentially oriented to the SNR shock front, indicative of an SNR
compressing the magnetic field threading the interstellar medium. The X-ray
spectrum is unusual as it requires a soft (~0.2 keV) CIE thermal plasma of
interstellar medium abundance, in addition to a harder component. Using our
results and the Sedov dynamical model, we showed that this emission is not
consistent with a Sedov remnant. We suggested that the thermal X-rays can be
explained by MCSNR J0512-6707 having initially evolved into a wind-blown cavity
and is now interacting with the surrounding dense shell. The origin of the hard
component remains unclear. We could not determine the supernova type from the
X-ray spectrum. Indirect evidence was found in the study of the local stellar
population and star formation history in the literature, which suggests a
core-collapse origin. MCSNR J0512-6707 likely resulted from the core-collapse
of high mass progenitor which carved a low density cavity into its surrounding
medium, with the soft X-rays resulting from the impact of the blast wave with
the surrounding shell. The unusual hard X-ray component requires deeper and
higher spatial resolution radio and X-ray observations to confirm its origin.

by means of random matrix theory. In this limit the only parameters are the
modal overlap and the number of open channels. Using the extended effective
Hamiltonian, we describe the intensity statistics of the vectorial

many forecasters to estimate a rapid arrival at Earth ($\approx$36 hours) and
predict a strong geomagnetic storm. However, only a glancing CME arrival was
observed at Earth with a transit time of $\approx$49 hours and a $K_{\rm P}$
geomagnetic index of only $3-$. We study the interplanetary propagation of this
CME using the ensemble Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA)-ENLIL+Cone model, that allows a
sampling of CME parameter uncertainties. We explore a series of simulations to
isolate the effects of the background solar wind solution, CME shape, tilt,
location, size, and speed, and the results are compared with observed in-situ
arrivals at Venus, Earth, and Mars. Our results show that a tilted ellipsoid
CME shape improves the initial real-time prediction to better reflect the
observed in-situ signatures and the geomagnetic storm strength. CME parameters
from the Graduated Cylindrical Shell model used as input to WSA--ENLIL+Cone,
along with a tilted ellipsoid cloud shape, improve the arrival-time error by
14.5, 18.7, 23.4 hours for Venus, Earth, and Mars respectively. These results
highlight that CME orientation and directionality with respect to observatories
play an important role in understanding the propagation of this CME, and for
forecasting other glancing CME arrivals. This study also demonstrates the
importance of three-dimensional CME fitting made possible by multiple viewpoint

square lattice whose sites are occupied by right and left rotators. These left
and right rotators deterministically rotate the particle's velocity to the
right or left, respectively and \emph{flip} orientation from right to left or
from left to right after scattering the particle. We study three types of
configurations of left and right rotators, which we think of as types of media,
through with the particle moves. These are completely random (CR), random
periodic (RP), and completely periodic (CP) configurations. For CR
configurations the particle's dynamics depends on the ratio $r$ of right to
left scatterers in the following way. For small $r\simeq0$, when the
configuration is nearly homogeneous, the particle subdiffuses with an exponent
of 2/3, similar to the diffusion of a macromolecule in a crowded environment.
Also, the particle's trajectory has a fractal dimension of $d_f\simeq4/3$,
comparable to that of a self-avoiding walk. As the ratio increases to $r\simeq
1$, the particle's dynamics transitions from subdiffusion to anomalous
diffusion with a fractal dimension of $d_f\simeq 7/4$, similar to that of a
percolating cluster in 2-d. In RP configurations, which are more structured
than CR configurations but also randomly generated, we find that the particle
has the same statistic as in the CR case. In contrast, CP configurations, which
are highly structured, typically will cause the particle to go through a
transient stage of subdiffusion, which then abruptly changes to propagation.
Interestingly, the subdiffusive stage has an exponent of approximately 2/3 and
a fractal dimension of $d_f\simeq4/3$, similar to the case of CR and RP
configurations for small $r$.

pre-shock flow speeds that are some fraction of the wind terminal speed. These
shocks generate hot plasma, a source of X-rays. In the last decade, several
developments took place, notably the determination of the hot plasma properties
for a large sample of objects using XMM-Newton and Chandra, as well as fully

parton and hadron cascade and dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence
(PACIAE + DCPC) model. We found that the yields of light (anti)nuclei and
(anti)hypertriton strongly depend on the centrality, i.e., their yields
decrease rapidly with the increase of centrality bins, but their yield ratios
are independent of centrality. The results of theoretical model are well
consistent with ALICE data. Furthermore, we found that the integrated yields of
(anti)nuclei per participant nucleon increase from peripheral to central
collisions more rapidly with increasing mass number. The transverse momentum

outperforms the current state-of-the-art method for measurement fusion in

envisioned as a promising candidate for the next-generation wireless
communication network. However, the joint processing gain of C-RAN is
fundamentally constrained by the finite-capacity fronthaul links between the
central unit (CU) where joint processing is implemented and distributed access
points known as remote radio heads (RRHs). In this paper, we consider the
downlink communication in a C-RAN with multi-antenna RRHs and single-antenna
users, and investigate the joint RRH beamforming and user-RRH association
problem to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
of all users subject to each RRH's individual fronthaul capacity constraint.
The formulated problem is in general NP-hard due to the fronthaul capacity
constraints and thus is difficult to be solved optimally. In this paper, we
propose a new iterative method for this problem which decouples the design of
beamforming and user association, where the number of users served by each RRH
is iteratively reduced until the obtained beamforming and user association
solution satisfies the fronthaul capacity constraints of all RRHs. A monotonic
convergence is proved for the proposed algorithm, and it is shown by simulation
that the algorithm achieves significant performance improvement over other

that an ideal unfolded ensemble of the full GQ sequence populates all 4096

idealized folding pathways but we explain that such few-state pathways may be
misleading. In the context of the available experimental data, the simulations
strongly suggest that the GQ folding could be best understood by the kinetic
partitioning mechanism with a set of deep competing minima on the folding
landscape, with only a small fraction of molecules directly folding to the
native fold. The landscape should further include nonspecific collapse
processes where the molecules move via diffusion and consecutive random rare

equation (PTE) describing non-stationary transport of charged particles in the

time-dependent 4-dimensional (3 spatial coordinates and particles
energy/rigidity) partial differential equation. It is worth to mention that, if
we assume the stationary case it remains as the 3-D parabolic type problem with
respect to the particles rigidity R. If we fix the energy it still remains as
the 3-D parabolic type problem with respect to time. The proposed method of
numerical solution is based on the solution of the system of stochastic

equation. We present the method of deriving from PTE the equivalent SDEs in the

operation of this system consists in a counter-propagating four-wave mixing
interaction between an incident signal and its backward replica generated at
the fiber output thanks to a reflective fiber loop. We have exploited this
self-induced polarization tracking phenomenon for all-optical data processing
and successfully demonstrated the spontaneous repolarization of a 40-Gbit/s
On-Off keying optical signal without noticeable impairments. Moreover, the
strong local coupling between the two counter-propagating waves has also
revealed a fascinating aspect of the Omnipolarizer called polarization-based
tunneling effect. This intrinsic property enables us to instantaneously let
jump a polarization information onto the reflected signal, long before the
expected time-of-flight induced by the round-trip along the fiber span.
Finally, we discuss how the concept of self-organization could be generalized
to multimode fibers, which paves the way to new important applications in the

We have recorded every single interaction within a large population, mapping
out---for the first time at scale---the complete proximity network for a

interaction-distance on the network structure and dynamics of spreading
processes. We create networks supporting close (intimate network, up to ~1m)

intimate network is fragmented, with weak ties bridging densely-connected
neighborhoods, whereas the ambient network supports spread driven by random
contacts between strangers. While there is no trivial mapping from the
micro-dynamics of proximity networks to empirical epidemics, these networks
provide a telling approximation of droplet and airborne modes of pathogen

important signposts of disk evolution and possibly the formation of planets. We
aim to characterize the 'flaring' disk structure around the Herbig Ae/Be stars
HD 100453 and HD 34282. Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) show an
emission excess between 15-40{\mu}m, but very weak (HD 100453) and no (HD
34282) signs of the 10 and 20 {\mu}m amorphous silicate features. We
investigate whether this implies the presence of large dust gaps. In this work,
spatially resolved mid-infrared Q-band images taken with Gemini North/MICHELLE
are investigated. We perform radiative transfer modeling and examine the radial
distribution of dust. We simultaneously fit the Q-band images and SEDs of HD
100453 and HD 34282. Our solutions require that the inner-halos and outer-disks
are likely separated by large dust gaps that are depleted wih respect to the
outer disk by a factor of 1000 or more. The inner edges of the outer disks of
HD 100453 and HD 34282 have temperatures of about $160 \pm 10$ K and $60 \pm 5$
K respectively. Because of the high surface brightnesses of these walls, they
dominate the emission in the Q-band. Their radii are constrained at 20+2 AU and
92+31 AU, respectively. We conclude that, HD 100453 and HD 34282 likely have
disk dust gaps and the upper limit on the dust mass in each gap is estimated to
be about $10^{-7}$M$_{\odot}$. We find that the locations and sizes of disk
dust gaps are connected to the SED, as traced by the mid-infrared flux ratio
F30/F13.5. We propose a new classification scheme for the Meeus groups (Meeus
et al. 2001) based on the F30/F13.5 ratio. The absence of amorphous silicate
features in the observed SEDs is caused by the depletion of small (smaller than
1 {\mu}m) silicate dust at temperatures above 160 K, which could be related to
the presence of a dust gap in that region of the disk.

interpretive phenomenological analysis. Results showed that the most important
factors influencing risk acceptance of cloud services are: perceived benefits

perceived risks and perceived security concerns. Based on these results, we
suggest a number of implications for risk managers, policy makers and cloud

apart from other atomically thin crystals is its structural in-plane anisotropy
which manifests in strongly anisotropic transport characteristics. However,
traditional angle-resolved conductance measurements present a challenge for
nanoscale systems such as black phosphorus, calling for new approaches in
precision studies of transport anisotropy. Here we show that the nonlocal
response, being exponentially sensitive to the anisotropy value, provides a
powerful tool for determining the anisotropy. This is established by combining
measurements of the orientation-dependent nonlocal resistance response with the
analysis based on the anamorphosis relations. We demonstrate that the nonlocal

  material for moderately large deformations",,,,,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work presents a hyper-viscoelastic model based on the Hencky-logarithmic
strain tensor to model the response of a Tire Derived Material (TDM) undergoing
moderately large deformations. TDM is a composite made by cold forging a mix of
rubber fibers and grains, obtained by grinding scrap tires, and polyurethane
binder. The mechanical properties are highly influenced by the presence of
voids associated with the granular composition and low tensile strength due to
the weak connection at the grain-matrix interface. For these reasons, TDM use
is restricted to applications concerning a limited range of deformations.
Experimental tests show that a central feature of the response is connected to
highly nonlinear behavior of the material under volumetric deformation which
conventional hyperelastic models fail in predicting. The strain energy function
presented here is a variant of the exponentiated Hencky strain energy proposed
by Neff et al., which for moderate strains is as good as the quadratic Hencky
model and in the large strain region improves several important features from a
mathematical point of view. The proposed form of the exponentiated Hencky
energy possesses a set of parameters uniquely determined in the infinitesimal
strain regime and an orthogonal set of parameters to determine the nonlinear
response. The hyperelastic model is additionally incorporated in a finite
deformation viscoelasticity framework that accounts for the two main
dissipation mechanisms in TDMs, one at the microscale level and one at the
macroscale level. The model is capable of predicting different deformation
modes in a certain range of frequency and amplitude with a unique set of
parameters with most of them having a clear physical meaning. Moreover, by
comparing the predictions from the proposed constitutive model with
experimental data we conclude that the new constitutive model gives accurate
prediction.

Euler-Lagrange systems subjected to unknown input delay and bounded

referred as Adaptive Robust Outer Loop Control (AROLC) is proposed. Compared to
the conventional predictor based approaches, the proposed controller is capable
of negotiating any input delay, within a stipulated range, without knowing the
delay or its variation. The maximum allowable input delay is computed through
Razumikhin-type stability analysis. AROLC also provides robustness against the
disturbances due to input delay, parametric variations and unmodelled dynamics
through switching control law. The novel adaptive law allows the switching gain
to modify itself online in accordance with the tracking error without any
prerequisite of the uncertainties. The uncertain system, employing AROLC, is
shown to be Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB). As a proof of concept,
experimentation is carried out on a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot with
various time varying as well as fixed input delay, and better tracking accuracy
of the proposed controller is noted compared to predictor based methodology.

study the adoption of technologies of uncertain value, when agents are
connected by a network and a monopolist seller chooses a policy to maximize
profits. Consumers with low degree (few friends) have incentives to adopt
early, while consumers with high degree have incentives to free ride. The
seller can induce high-degree consumers to adopt early by offering referral
incentives - rewards to early adopters whose friends buy in the second period.
Referral incentives thus lead to a `double-threshold strategy' by which low and
high-degree agents adopt the product early while middle-degree agents wait. We
show that referral incentives are optimal on certain networks while
inter-temporal price discrimination (i.e., a first-period price discount) is
optimal on others, and discuss welfare implications.

i.e., the method should have high precision, b) Diverse retrieval, i.e., the
obtained set of points should be diverse, c) Retrieval time should be small.
However, most of the existing methods address only one or two of the above
mentioned requirements. In this work, we present a method based on randomized
locality sensitive hashing which tries to address all of the above requirements
simultaneously. While earlier hashing approaches considered approximate
retrieval to be acceptable only for the sake of efficiency, we argue that one
can further exploit approximate retrieval to provide impressive trade-offs
between accuracy and diversity. We extend our method to the problem of
multi-label prediction, where the goal is to output a diverse and accurate set
of labels for a given document in real-time. Moreover, we introduce a new
notion to simultaneously evaluate a method's performance for both the precision
and diversity measures. Finally, we present empirical results on several
different retrieval tasks and show that our method retrieves diverse and
accurate images/labels while ensuring $100x$-speed-up over the existing diverse
retrieval approaches.

Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect and the infrared emission from the galaxies that
make up the the cosmic infrared background (CIB). We first perform a stacking
analysis towards Planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. We detect infrared emission
produced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that the
infrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tSZ effect. Modelling the
emission with a Navarro--Frenk--White profile, we find that the radial profile
concentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. This indicates
that infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared flux
than cluster-core galaxies. We also study the cross-correlation between tSZ and
CIB anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on power
spectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected in
Planck data; (ii) using an all-sky tSZ map built from Planck frequency maps;
and (iii) using cross-spectra between Planck frequency maps. With the three
different methods, we detect the tSZ-CIB cross-power spectrum at significance
levels of (i) 6 $\sigma$, (ii) 3 $\sigma$, and (iii) 4 $\sigma$. We model the
tSZ-CIB cross-correlation signature and compare predictions with the
measurements. The amplitude of the cross-correlation relative to the fiducial
model is $A_{\rm tSZ-CIB}= 1.2\pm0.3$. This result is consistent with
predictions for the tSZ-CIB cross-correlation assuming the best-fit

experienced by nonlinear waves in focusing and in defocusing propagation
regimes. As a result of nonlinear propagation, the power spectrum of the random
wave broadens and takes exponential wings both in focusing and in defocusing

focusing regime while low-tailed deviations from gaussian statistics are
observed in defocusing regime. After some transient evolution, the wave system
is found to exhibit a statistically stationary state in which neither the
probability density function of the wave field nor the spectrum change with the
evolution variable. Separating fluctuations of small scale from fluctuations of
large scale both in focusing and defocusing regime, we reveal the phenomenon of
intermittency; i.e., small scales are characterized by large heavy-tailed

great advantages in computational speed, which are able to achieve real-time
performance in numerous image/vision applications. Various methods have been
proposed to learn data-dependent binary descriptors. However, most existing
binary descriptors aim overly at computational simplicity at the expense of
significant information loss which causes ambiguity in similarity measure using
Hamming distance. In this paper, by considering multiple features might share
complementary information, we present a novel local binary descriptor, referred
as Ring-based Multi-Grouped Descriptor (RMGD), to successfully bridge the
performance gap between current binary and floated-point descriptors. Our
contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a new pooling configuration
based on spatial ring-region sampling, allowing for involving binary tests on
the full set of pairwise regions with different shapes, scales and distances.
This leads to a more meaningful description than existing methods which
normally apply a limited set of pooling configurations. Then, an extended
Adaboost is proposed for efficient bit selection by emphasizing high variance
and low correlation, achieving a highly compact representation. Secondly, the
RMGD is computed from multiple image properties where binary strings are
extracted. We cast multi-grouped features integration as rankSVM or sparse SVM
learning problem, so that different features can compensate strongly for each
other, which is the key to discriminativeness and robustness. The performance
of RMGD was evaluated on a number of publicly available benchmarks, where the
RMGD outperforms the state-of-the-art binary descriptors significantly.

and rapidly evolving distribution of dense gas and star forming regions.
Although bars mainly host regions void of any star formation activity, their
extremities can gather the physical conditions for the formation of molecular
complexes and mini-starbursts. Using a sub-parsec resolution hydrodynamical
simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, we probe these conditions to explore how
and where bar (hydro-)dynamics favours the formation or destruction of
molecular clouds and stars. The interplay between the kpc-scale dynamics (gas
flows, shear) and the parsec-scale (turbulence) is key to this problem. We find
a strong dichotomy between the leading and trailing sides of the bar, in term
of cloud fragmentation and in the age distribution of the young stars. After
orbiting along the bar edge, these young structures slow down at the
extremities of the bar, where orbital crowding increases the probability of
cloud-cloud collision. We find that such events increase the Mach number of the
cloud, leading to an enhanced star formation efficiency and finally the
formation of massive stellar associations, in a fashion similar to
galaxy-galaxy interactions. We highlight the role of bar dynamics in decoupling
young stars from the clouds in which they form, and discuss the implications on
the injection of feedback into the interstellar medium, in particular in the
context of galaxy formation.

treasury programs with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have provided new

44 CCSNe to determine volumetric rates, $R_{CC}$, in six redshift bins in the
range $0.1<z<2.5$. Together with rates from our previous HST program, and rates
from the literature, we trace a more complete history of $R_{CC}(z)$, with
$R_{CC}=0.72\pm0.06$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ 10$^{-4}$ $h_{70}^{3}$ at $z<0.08$,
and increasing to $3.7^{+3.1}_{-1.6}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ 10$^{-4}$
$h_{70}^{3}$ to $z\approx2.0$. The statistical precision in each bin is several
factors better than than the systematic error, with significant contributions
from host extinction, and average peak absolute magnitudes of the assumed
luminosity functions for CCSN types. Assuming negligible time delays from
stellar formation to explosion, we find these composite CCSN rates to be in
excellent agreement with cosmic star formation rate density (SFRs) derived
largely from dust-corrected rest-frame UV emission, with a scaling factor of
$k=0.0091\pm0.0017\,M^{-1}_{\odot}$, and inconsistent (to $>95\%$ confidence)
with SFRs from IR luminous galaxies, or with SFR models that include simple
evolution in the initial mass function over time. This scaling factor is
expected if the fraction of the IMF contributing to CCSN progenitors is in the
8 to 50 $M_{\odot}$ range. It is not supportive, however, of an upper mass
limit for progenitors at $<20\,M_{\odot}$.

embryonic development and cancer metastasis, and recent experiments suggest
that these tissues exhibit collective glassy behavior. To make quantitative
predictions about glass transitions in tissues, we study a self-propelled
Voronoi (SPV) model that simultaneously captures polarized cell motility and
multi-body cell-cell interactions in a confluent tissue, where there are no
gaps between cells. We demonstrate that the model exhibits a jamming transition
from a solid-like state to a fluid-like state that is controlled by three
parameters: the single-cell motile speed, the persistence time of single-cell
tracks, and a target shape index that characterizes the competition between
cell-cell adhesion and cortical tension. In contrast to traditional particulate
glasses, we are able to identify an experimentally accessible structural order
parameter that specifies the entire jamming surface as a function of model
parameters. We demonstrate that a continuum Soft Glassy Rheology model
precisely captures this transition in the limit of small persistence times, and
explain how it fails in the limit of large persistence times. These results
provide a framework for understanding the collective solid-to-liquid
transitions that have been observed in embryonic development and cancer
progression, which may be associated with Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition
in these tissues.

achieve a powerful life-time expression of the Neel states for arbitrary spin

near-field wireless power transfer (WPT). The use of multiple transmitters
(TXs) each with one coil can be applied to enhance the WPT performance by
focusing the magnetic fields from all TX coils in a beam toward the receiver
(RX) coil, termed as ""magnetic beamforming"". In this paper, we study the
optimal magnetic beamforming for an MRC-WPT system with multiple TXs and a
single RX. We formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the currents
flowing through different TXs so as to minimize the total power drawn from
their voltage sources, subject to the minimum power required by the RX load as
well as the TXs' constraints on the peak voltage and current. For the special
case of identical TX resistances and neglecting all TXs' constraints on the
peak voltage and current, we show that the optimal current magnitude of each TX
is proportional to the mutual inductance between its TX coil and the RX coil.
In general, the problem is a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic

II is set by the hydrogen ionization balance through charge exchange reactions.
The emission in the O I 135.56 nm line is dominated by a recombination cascade
and the line is optically thin. The Doppler shift of the maximum emission
correlates strongly with the vertical velocity in its line forming region,
which is typically located at 1.0 - 1.5 Mm height. The total intensity of the

correlation between the relative differential rotation coefficient and the
rotation period, but do not reveal any dependence of the differential rotation

activity cycles in 18 of the stars and temporary or persistent active
longitudes in 11 of them. The activity cycles fall into specific activity
branches. We find a new split into sub-branches, indicating multiple
simultaneously present cycle modes. Active longitudes appear to be present only
on the more active stars. There is a sharp break at approximately $\log{R'_{\rm

distributions from the more active ones with non-axisymmetric configurations.
In seven out of eleven of our stars with clearly detected long-term
non-axisymmetric spot activity the estimated active longitude periods are
significantly shorter than the mean photometric rotation periods. This
systematic trend can be interpreted either as a sign of the active longitudes
being sustained from a deeper level in the stellar interior than the individual
spots or as azimuthal dynamo waves exhibiting prograde propagation.

content delivery in cache-enabled HetNets by taking into account the inherent
multicast capability of wireless medium. We consider stochastic content
multicast scheduling to jointly minimize the average network delay and power
costs under a multiple access constraint. We establish a content-centric
request queue model and formulate this stochastic optimization problem as an
infinite horizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP). By using
\emph{relative value iteration} and special properties of the request queue

Based on these properties, we show that the optimal multicast scheduling policy
is of threshold type. Then, we propose a structure-aware optimal algorithm to
obtain the optimal policy. We also propose a low-complexity suboptimal policy,
which possesses similar structural properties to the optimal policy, and
develop a low-complexity algorithm to obtain this policy.

positive-definiteness of the strain energy (implying uniqueness of the mixed

only solution for $k=5$ is $x=z=0$, and that there are no solutions for $k=6$.
The chief innovation we employ is a computational one, which enables us to
avoid the full computation of data about cuspidal newforms of high level.

the so-called Hill-Mandel principle of macrohomogeneity are essential
ingredients for the coupling and the consistency between the micro and macro
scales in multiscale finite element procedures (FE$^2$). We show in this paper
that these averaging relations hold exactly under standard finite element
discretizations, even if the stress field is discontinuous across elements and
the standard proofs based on the divergence theorem are no longer suitable. The
discrete averaging results are derived for the three classical types of
boundary conditions (affine displacement, periodic and uniform traction
boundary conditions) using the properties of the shape functions and the weak
form of the microscopic equilibrium equations. The analytical proofs are
further verified numerically through a simple finite element simulation of an
irregular representative volume element undergoing large deformations.
Furthermore, the proofs are extended to include the effects of body forces and
inertia, and the results are consistent with those in the smooth continuum
setting. This work provides a solid foundation to apply Hill's averaging
relations in multiscale finite element methods without introducing an
additional error in the scale transition due to the discretization.

particles. A mesoscopic depinning-like model accounting for Eshelby elastic
interactions is implemented. Only the effect of a plastic disorder is
considered. Numerical results show a complex size-dependence of the effective
flow stress of the amorphous composite. In particular the departure from the
mixing law shows opposite trends associated to the competing effects of the
matrix and the reinforcing particles respectively. The reinforcing mechanisms
and their effects on localization are discussed. Plastic strain is shown to
gradually concentrate on the weakest band of the system. This correlation of
the plastic behavior with the material structure is used to design a simple
analytical model. The latter nicely captures reinforcement size effects in
$-(\log N/N)^{1/2}$ observed numerically. Predictions of the effective flow
stress accounting for further logarithmic corrections show a very good
agreement with numerical results.

with $X$ being either Euclidean $3$-space $\mathbb{E}^3$ or hyperbolic
$3$-space $\mathbb{H}^3$ or $\mathbb{C}P^1$ , by $\mathscr{P}_{k,d}$ the vector
space of homogeneous complex polynomials in the variables $z_0, \ldots, z_k$ of
degree $d$, and by $\mathrm{Obs}^n_d$ the set of all $d$-subsets of
$\{1,\ldots,n\}$, the symmetric group $\Sigma_n$ acts on $C_n(\mathbb{R}^3)$ by
permuting the $n$ points and also acts in a natural way on $\mathrm{Obs}^n_d$.
With $n = k+d$, the space $\mathscr{P}_{k,d}$ has dimension $\binom{n}{d}$,
which is also the number of elements in $\mathrm{Obs}^n_d$. It is thus natural
to ask the following question. Is there a family of continuous maps $f_I:
C_n(X) \to \mathbb{P}\mathscr{P}_{k,d}$, for $I \in \mathrm{Obs}^n_d$ (here
$\mathbb{P}$ is complex projectivization), which satisfies
$f_I(\sigma.\mathbf{x}) = f_{\sigma.I}(\mathbf{x})$, for all $\sigma \in
\Sigma_n$ and all $\mathbf{x} \in C_n(X)$, and such that, for each $\mathbf{x}
\in C_n(X)$, the polynomials $f_I(\mathbf{x})$, for $I\in \mathrm{Obs}^n_d$,
each defined up to a scalar factor, are linearly independent over $\mathbb{C}$?
We provide two closely related smooth candidates for such maps for each of the
two cases, Euclidean and hyperbolic, which would be solutions to the above
problem provided a linear independence conjecture holds. Our maps are natural
extensions of the Atiyah-Sutcliffe maps. Moreover, we get two constructions of
actual solutions of the above problem for $X = \mathbb{C}P^1$, as we prove
linear independence for these last two constructions. These last two
constructions are classical in character, and can be viewed as higher
dimensional versions of Lagrange polynomial interpolation. They appear to be
new.

used to detect communities but classic spectral methods based on the adjacency
matrix and its variants fail to detect communities in sparse networks. New
spectral methods based on non-backtracking random walks have recently been
introduced that successfully detect communities in many sparse networks.
However, the spectrum of non-backtracking random walks ignores hanging trees in
networks that can contain information about the community structure of
networks. We introduce the reluctant backtracking operators that explicitly
account for hanging trees as they admit a small probability of returning to the
immediately previous node unlike the non-backtracking operators that forbid an
immediate return. We show that the reluctant backtracking operators can detect
communities in certain sparse networks where the non-backtracking operators
cannot while performing comparably on benchmark stochastic block model networks
and real world networks. We also show that the spectrum of the reluctant
backtracking operator approximately optimises the standard modularity function
similar to the flow matrix. Interestingly, for this family of non- and
reluctant-backtracking operators the main determinant of performance on
real-world networks is whether or not they are normalised to conserve
probability at each node.

as the rate by which defects accumulate during their evolution. The former

case of optically thin disks gas is pushed out by magnetic field in the polar
region and by thermal pressure and centrifugal force below the disk surface. In
case of optically thick, radiative accretion, it is the radiation pressure
which accelerates the gas in the polar funnel and which compensates (together
with the centrifugal force) the gravity in the bulk of the disk. We also show
that the Newtonian formulae for the forces are inadequate in the innermost and

  We do not detect a separate thick disk in any of the three galaxies, even
though our observations cover a wider range in equivalent surface brightness
than any integrated light study. While scale heights increase with age, each
population can be well described by a single disk. Two of the galaxies contain
a very weak additional component, which we identify as the faint halo. The mass
of these faint halos is lower than 1% of the mass of the disk. The three
galaxies show low vertical heating rates, which are much lower than the heating
rate of the Milky Way. This indicates that heating agents, such as giant
molecular clouds and spiral structure, are weak in low-mass galaxies. All
populations in the three galaxies exhibit no or only little flaring. While this
finding is consistent with previous integrated light studies, it poses strong
constraints on galaxy simulations, where strong flaring is often found as a
result of interactions or radial migration.

expected in nanoscale materials. Recent experiments in polycrystalline,

setup based on an electromagnetic shutter placed in the condenser plane of a
STEM is proposed. The shutter blanks the beam following a random pattern while
the scanning coils are moving the beam in the usual scan pattern. Experimental
images at both medium scale and high resolution are acquired and then
reconstructed based on a discrete cosine algorithm. The obtained results
confirm the predicted usefulness of compressive sensing in experimental STEM
even though some remaining artifacts need to be resolved.

  Linear Regression Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithm Smoothing","11 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.SY cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time-varying delays adversely affect the performance of networked control
sys-tems (NCS) and in the worst-case can destabilize the entire system.
Therefore, modelling network delays is important for designing NCS. However,
modelling time-varying delays is challenging because of their dependence on
multiple pa-rameters such as length, contention, connected devices, protocol
employed, and channel loading. Further, these multiple parameters are
inherently random and de-lays vary in a non-linear fashion with respect to
time. This makes estimating ran-dom delays challenging. This investigation
presents a methodology to model de-lays in NCS using experiments and general
regression neural network (GRNN) due to their ability to capture non-linear
relationship. To compute the optimal smoothing parameter that computes the best
estimates, genetic algorithm is used. The objective of the genetic algorithm is
to compute the optimal smoothing pa-rameter that minimizes the mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE). Our results illustrate that the resulting GRNN is able
to predict the delays with less than 3% error. The proposed delay model gives a
framework to design compensation schemes for NCS subjected to time-varying
delays.

to g-modes and, as an application, we studied the stability of the tide in
coalescing binary neutron stars. Although we found that the tide is p-g
unstable early in the inspiral and rapidly drives modes to large energies, our
analysis only accounted for three-mode interactions. Venumadhav, Zimmerman, and
Hirata showed that four-mode interactions must also be accounted for as they
enter into the analysis at the same order. They found a near-exact cancellation
between three- and four-mode interactions and concluded that while the tide in
binary neutron stars can be p-g unstable, the growth rates are not fast enough
to impact the gravitational wave signal. Their analysis assumes that the linear
tide is incompressible, which is true of the static linear tide (the m=0
harmonic) but not the non-static linear tide (m=+/- 2). Here we account for the
compressibility of the non-static linear tide and find that the three- and
four-mode interactions no longer cancel. As a result, we find that the
instability can rapidly drive modes to significant energies (there is time for
several dozen e-foldings of growth before the binary merges). We also show that
linear damping interferes with the cancellation and may further enhance the p-g
growth rates. The early onset of the instability (at gravitational wave
frequencies near 50 Hz), the rapid growth rates, and the large number of
unstable modes (> 10^3), suggest that the instability could impact the phase
evolution of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars. Assessing its
impact will require an understanding of how the instability saturates and is
left to future work.

sums. Crucially, both resolutions return the correct Born probabilities for the
original observables. Here, an alternative proof of the Sz.-Nagy result is
given using elementary inner product spaces. A version of the resolution is
then shown to respect all products of observables on the base space. Practical
and theoretical consequences are indicated. For example, quantum statistical
inference problems that involve any algebraic functionals can now be studied
using classical statistical methods over commuting observables. The estimation
of quantum states is a problem of this type. Further, as theoretical objects,

Renormalization is an essential and defining step to make this description
physical and predictive. Here we introduce a systematic renormalization
procedure, which neatly associates counterterms to the UV-sensitive diagrams
order by order, as it is commonly done in quantum field theory. As a concrete
example, we renormalize the one-loop power spectrum and bispectrum of both
density and velocity. In addition, we present a series of results that are
valid to all orders in perturbation theory. First, we show that while
systematic renormalization requires temporally non-local counterterms, in
practice one can use an equivalent basis made of local operators. We give an
explicit prescription to generate all counterterms allowed by the symmetries.
Second, we present a formal proof of the well-known general argument that the
contribution of short distance perturbations to large scale density contrast
$\delta$ and momentum density $\mathbf\pi(\mathbf k)$ scale as $k^2$ and $k$,
respectively. Third, we demonstrate that the common practice of introducing
counterterms only in the Euler equation when one is interested in correlators
of $ \delta$ is indeed valid to all orders.

general relativity (GR), mass is a contextual property of matter, i.e., matter
can simultaneously possess two different values of mass when it is responsible
for two different spatiotemporal geometries. Herein, we explore the possibility
that the astrophysical missing mass attributed to non-baryonic dark matter (DM)
actually obtains because we have been assuming the Newtonian view of mass
rather than the GR view. Since an exact GR solution for realistic astrophysical
situations is not feasible, we explore GR-motivated ansatzes relating proper
mass and dynamic mass for one and the same baryonic matter, as justified by GR
contextuality. We consider four GR alternatives and find that the GR ansatz
motivated by metric perturbation theory works well in fitting galactic rotation
curves (THINGS data), the mass profiles of X-ray clusters (ROSAT and ASCA data)
and the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB, Planck
2015 data) without DM. We compare our galactic rotation curve fits to modified
Newtonian dynamics (MOND), Burkett halo DM and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo
DM. We compare our X-ray cluster mass profile fits to metric skew-tensor
gravity (MSTG) and core-modified NFW DM. We compare our CMB angular power
spectrum fit to scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG) and $\Lambda$CDM. Overall,
we find our fits to be comparable to those of MOND, MSTG, STVG, $\Lambda$CDM,
Burkett, and NFW. We present and discuss correlations and trends for the best
fit values of our fitting parameters. For the most part, the correlations are
consistent with well-established results at all scales, which is perhaps
surprising given the simple functional form of the GR ansatz.
