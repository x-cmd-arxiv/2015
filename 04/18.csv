however, that the estimated long lifetimes of neutron star binaries are in
conflict with the presence of r-process-enhanced halo stars at metallicities as
low as [Fe/H] ~ -3. To resolve this problem, we examine the role of NSMs in the
early Galactic chemical evolution on the assumption that the Galactic halo was
formed from merging sub-halos. We present simple models for the chemical
evolution of sub-halos with total final stellar masses between 10^4 M_solar and
2 x 10^8 M_solar. Typical lifetimes of compact binaries are assumed to be 100
Myr (for 95% of their population) and 1 Myr (for 5%), according to recent
binary population synthesis studies. The resulting metallcities of sub-halos
and their ensemble are consistent with the observed mass-metallicity relation
of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, and the metallicity distribution of the
Galactic halo, respectively. We find that the r-process abundance ratios [r/Fe]
start increasing at [Fe/H] <= -3 if the star formation efficiencies are smaller
for less massive sub-halos. In addition, the sub-solar [r/Fe] values (observed
as [Ba/Fe] ~ -1.5 for [Fe/H] < -3) are explained by the contribution from the
short-lived (~1 Myr) binaries. Our results indicate that NSMs may have a
substantial contribution to the r-process element abundances throughout the

reviewing important concepts of the DNA mechanics, from the basic mechanical
properties to the Worm-Like Chain model. Next we review the basic concepts of
the physical chemistry of DNA-ligand interactions, revisiting the most
important models used to analyze the binding data and discussing their binding
isotherms. Then, we discuss the basic features of the single molecule

interactions that can occur between DNA and ligands, from covalent binding to
simple electrostatic driven interactions. Finally, we present a historical
survey on the attempts to connect mechanics to physical chemistry for
DNA-ligand systems, emphasizing a recently developed fitting approach useful to
connect the persistence length of the DNA-ligand complexes to the
physicochemical properties of the interaction. Such approach in principle can
be used for any type of ligand, from drugs to proteins, even if multiple

algebraic number, and let $f \in \mathbb{Q}[t]$ be the minimal polynomial of
$\alpha$. In this paper we present a new efficient method to compute Gr\""obner
bases in polynomial rings over the algebraic number field $K$. Starting from
the ideas of Noro [Noro, 2006], we proceed by joining $f$ to the ideal to be
considered, adding $t$ as an extra variable. But instead of avoiding
superfluous S-pair reductions by inverting algebraic numbers, we achieve the
same goal by applying modular methods as in [Arnold, 2003; B\""ohm et al., 2015;
Idrees et al., 2011], that is, by inferring information in characteristic zero
from information in characteristic $p > 0$. For suitable primes $p$, the
minimal polynomial $f$ is reducible over $\mathbb{F}_p$. This allows us to
apply modular methods once again, on a second level, with respect to the
factors of $f$. The algorithm thus resembles a divide and conquer strategy and
is in particular easily parallelizable. At current state, the algorithm is
probabilistic in the sense that, as for other modular Gr\""obner basis
computations, an effective final verification test is only known for
homogeneous ideals or for local monomial orderings. The presented timings show
that for most examples, our algorithm, which has been implemented in SINGULAR,
outperforms other known methods by far.

surface were a membrane stretched around a fluid layer. `Membrane worlds' is
thus a fitting name for these bodies and membrane theory provides the perfect
toolbox to predict tidal effects. I describe here a new membrane approach to
tidal perturbations based on the general theory of viscoelastic-gravitational
deformations of spherically symmetric bodies. The massive membrane approach
leads to explicit formulas for viscoelastic tidal Love numbers which are exact
in the limit of zero crust thickness. Formulas for load Love numbers come as a
bonus. The accuracy on $k_2$ and $h_2$ is better than one percent if the crust
thickness is less than five percents of the surface radius, which is probably
the case for Europa and Titan. The new approach allows for density differences
between crust and ocean and correctly includes crust compressibility. This last
feature makes it more accurate than the incompressible propagator matrix
method. Membrane formulas factorize shallow and deep interior contributions,
the latter affecting Love numbers mainly through density stratification. I show
that a screening effect explains why ocean stratification typically increases
Love numbers instead of reducing them. For Titan, a thin and dense liquid layer
at the bottom of a light ocean can raise $k_2$ by more than ten percents. The
membrane approach can also deal with dynamical tides in a non-rotating body. I
show that a dynamical resonance significantly decreases the tilt factor and may
thus lead to underestimating Europa's crust thickness. Finally, the dynamical
resonance increases tidal deformations and tidal heating in the crust if the
ocean thickness is of the order of a few hundred meters.

million binary variables in the second stage. We develop a two-level approach
by constructing a semi-coarse model (coarsened with respect to variables) and a
coarse model (coarsened with respect to both variables and constraints). We
coarsen binary variables by selecting a small number of pre-specified daily
on/off profiles. We aggregate constraints by partitioning them into groups and
summing over each group. With an appropriate choice of coarsened profiles, the
semi-coarse model is guaranteed to find a feasible solution of the original
problem and hence provides an upper bound on the optimal solution. We show that
solving a sequence of coarse models converges to the same upper bound with
proven finite steps. This is achieved by adding violated constraints to coarse
models until all constraints in the semi-coarse model are satisfied. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in cogeneration for buildings.
The coarsened models allow us to obtain good approximate solutions at a
fraction of the time required by solving the original problem. Extensive
numerical experiments show that the two-level approach scales to large problems
that are beyond the capacity of state-of-the-art commercial MILP solvers.

initially excited far away from equilibrium, but their interactions lead them
into a stationary stage, with exact equipartition among the different energy
components. From there on the system eventually reaches equilibrium. We have
characterized in detail, in the different expansion histories considered, the
evolution of the Higgs and of its dominant decay products, until equipartition
is established. We provide a useful mapping between simulations with different
parameters, from where we derive a master formula for the Higgs decay time, as
a function of the coupling constants, Higgs initial amplitude and
postinflationary expansion rate.

Tight-binding calculations based on four orbitals per atom and an effective
single orbital are presented to match with the results obtained from
first-principles calculations. In particular, the electronic band structure and
the band splitting are investigated with both models. Moreover, the simple
$k\cdot p$ model is also considered in order to understand the band splitting
in the presence of an external electric field and spin-orbit coupling. A large
splitting is obtained, which is expected to be useful for spintronic devices.
The fair agreement between the first-principle, $k\cdot p$ model, and

tight-binding studies on hexagonal 2-D nanostructures. By using the tight

the particle is displaced by random thermal kicks into the nonconservative part
of the optical force field arising from radiation pressure, which then biases
its diffusion. Assuming the particle remains localized within the trap, its
time-averaged trajectory traces out a toroidal vortex. Unlike trivial Brownian
vortexes, such as the biased Brownian pendulum, which circulate preferentially

OGLE-LMC-CEP-2532 (MACHO 81.8997.87). The system has an orbital period of 800
days and the Cepheid is pulsating with a period of 2.035 days.
  Using spectroscopic data from three high-class telescopes and photometry from
three surveys spanning 7500 days we are able to derive the dynamical masses for
both stars with an accuracy better than 3%. This makes the Cepheid in this
system one of a few classical Cepheids with an accurate dynamical mass
determination (M_1=3.90 +/- 0.10 M_sun). The companion is probably slightly
less massive (3.82 +/- 0.10 M_sun), but may have the same mass within errors
(M_2/M_1= 0.981 +/- 0.015). The system has an age of about 185 million years
and the Cepheid is in a more advanced evolutionary stage.
  For the first time precise parameters are derived for both stars in this
system. Due to the lack of the secondary eclipse for many years not much was
known about the Cepheid's companion. In our analysis we used extra information
from the pulsations and the orbital solution from the radial velocity curve.
The best model predicts a grazing secondary eclipse shallower than 1 mmag,
hence undetectable in the data, about 370 days after the primary eclipse.
  The dynamical mass obtained here is the most accurate known for a
first-overtone Cepheid and will contribute to the solution of the Cepheid mass
discrepancy problem.

inner knot, located a fraction of an arcsecond from the pulsar.
  We find that the knot's radial size, tangential size, peak flux, and the
ratio of the flux to that of the pulsar are correlated with the projected
distance of the knot from the pulsar. A new approach, using singular value
decomposition for analyzing time series of images, was introduced yielding
results consistent with the more traditional methods while some uncertainties
were substantially reduced.

inferences as to wind magnetization, shock shape parameters such as incident
angle and poloidal radius of curvature, as well as the IR/optical emitting

of merit to characterize its ability to transmit quantum information
coherently. The capacity determines the maximal rate at which we can code
reliably over asymptotically many uses of the channel. We argue that this
asymptotic treatment is insufficient to the point of being irrelevant in the
quantum setting where decoherence severely limits our ability to manipulate
large quantum systems in the encoder and decoder. For all practical purposes we
should instead focus on the trade-off between three parameters: the rate of the
code, the number of coherent uses of the channel, and the fidelity of the
transmission. The aim is then to specify the region determined by allowed
combinations of these parameters. Towards this goal, we find approximate and
exact characterizations of the region of allowed triplets for the qubit
dephasing channel and for the erasure channel with classical post-processing
assistance. In each case the region is parametrized by a second channel
parameter, the quantum channel dispersion. In the process we also develop
several general inner (achievable) and outer (converse) bounds on the coding
region that are valid for all finite-dimensional quantum channels and can be
computed efficiently. Applied to the depolarizing channel, this allows us to
determine a lower bound on the number of coherent uses of the channel necessary

two-dimensional images reconstructed. The technique aims at diffraction-limited
optical aperture synthesis over kilometre-long baselines to reach resolutions
showing details on stellar surfaces and perhaps even the silhouettes of
transiting exoplanets. Intensity interferometry circumvents problems of
atmospheric turbulence that constrain ordinary interferometry. Since the
electronic signal can be copied, many baselines can be built up between
dispersed telescopes, and over long distances. Using arrays of air Cherenkov

simulations of realistic Milky Way-galaxy analogs with varying sub-grid
physics. In all three cases, the mass of hot ($T > 10^6$ K) halo gas is $\sim
1\%$ of the host's virial mass. The X-ray luminosity of two of the runs is
consistent with observations of the Milky Way, while the third simulation is
X-ray bright and resembles more closely a very massive, star-forming spiral.
Hot halos extend to 140 kpc from the galactic center and are surrounded by a
bubble of warm-hot ($T = 10^5 - 10^6$K) gas that extends to the virial radius.
Simulated halos agree well outside 20-30 kpc with the $\beta$-model of Miller &
Bregman (2013) based on OVII absorption and OVIII emission measurements.
Warm--hot and hot gas contribute up to $80\%$ of the total gas reservoir, and
contain nearly the same amount of baryons as the stellar component. The mass of
warm-hot and hot components falls into the range estimated for $L^*$ galaxies.
With key observational constraints on the density of the Milky Way corona being
satisfied, we show that concealing of the ubiquitous warm-hot baryons, along
with the ejection of just $20-30 \%$ of the diffuse gas out of the potential
wells by supernova-driven outflows, can solve the ""missing baryon problem"". The
recovered baryon fraction within 3 virial radii is $90\%$ of the universal
value. With a characteristic density of $\sim 10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$ at $50-80$
kpc, diffuse coronae meet the requirement for fast and complete ram--pressure
stripping of the gas reservoirs in dwarf galaxy satellites.

alternatives to dark energy as well as the development of cosmological tests of

accurately within the local universe i.e. the Solar System, but this leaves the
possibility open that it is not a good description of gravity at the largest
scales in the Universe. This being said, the standard model of cosmology
assumes GR on all scales. In 1998, astronomers made the surprising discovery
that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, not slowing down. This
late-time acceleration of the Universe has become the most challenging problem
in theoretical physics. Within the framework of GR, the acceleration would
originate from an unknown dark energy. Alternatively, it could be that there is
no dark energy and GR itself is in error on cosmological scales. In this
review, we first give an overview of recent developments in modified gravity
theories including $f(R)$ gravity, braneworld gravity, Horndeski theory and
massive/bigravity theory. We then focus on common properties these models
share, such as screening mechanisms they use to evade the stringent Solar
System tests. Once armed with a theoretical knowledge of modified gravity
models, we move on to discuss how we can test modifications of gravity on
cosmological scales. We present tests of gravity using linear cosmological
perturbations and review the latest constraints on deviations from the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model. Since screening mechanisms leave distinct signatures in the
non-linear structure formation, we also review novel astrophysical tests of
gravity using clusters, dwarf galaxies and stars.

The mass of Kepler-539b was accurately derived thanks to a series of precise
radial velocity measurements obtained with the CAFE spectrograph mounted on the
CAHA 2.2m telescope. A simultaneous fit of the radial-velocity data and Kepler
photometry revealed that Kepler-539b is a dense Jupiter-like planet with a mass
of Mp = 0.97 Mjup and a radius of Rp = 0.747 Rjup, making a complete circular
revolution around its parent star in 125.6 days. The semi-major axis of the
orbit is roughly 0.5 au, implying that the planet is at roughly 0.45 au from
the habitable zone. By analysing the mid-transit times of the 12 transit events
of Kepler-539b recorded by the Kepler spacecraft, we found a clear modulated
transit time variation (TTV), which is attributable to the presence of a planet
c in a wider orbit. The few timings available do not allow us to precisely
estimate the properties of Kepler-539c and our analysis suggests that it has a
mass between 1.2 and 3.6 Mjup, revolving on a very eccentric orbit (0.4<e<0.6)
with a period larger than 1000 days. The high eccentricity of planet c is the
probable cause of the TTV modulation of planet b. The analysis of the CAFE

dex, which, together with both a gyrochronological and isochronal analysis,
suggests that the parent star is relatively young.

can be brightened by the collision of the supernova ejecta with the companion
star. The early brightening can be observed when the observer is in the
direction of the hole created by the collision. Based on a population synthesis
model, we estimate the fractions of core-collapse supernovae in which the
light-curve brightening by the collision can be observed. We find that 0.19% of
core-collapse supernova light curves can be observed with the collisional
brightening. Type Ibc supernova light curves are more likely to be brightened
by the collision (0.53%) because of the high fraction of the progenitors being
in binary systems and their proximity to the companion stars. Type II and IIb
supernova light curves are less affected (~1e-3% and ~1e-2%, respectively).
Although the early, slow light-curve declines of some Type IIb and Ibc

small separation required, disfavour the argument. The future transient survey

able to provide information on supernova progenitors in binary systems.

subduction-induced explosive eruptions inject SO2 directly into the
stratosphere, leading to the formation of sulfate aerosols with lifetimes of
months to years. We demonstrate that the rapid increase and gradual decrease in
sulfate aerosol loading associated with these eruptions may be detectable in
transit transmission spectra with future large-aperture telescopes, such as the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and European Extremely-Large Telescope
(E-ELT) for a planetary system at a distance of 10 pc, assuming an Earth-like
atmosphere, bulk composition, and size. Specifically, we find that a S/N of
12.1 and 7.1 could be achieved with E-ELT (assuming photon-limited noise) for
an Earth-analog orbiting a Sun-like star and M5V star, respectively, even
without multiple transits binned together. We propose that the detection of
this transient signal would strongly suggest an exoplanet volcanic eruption, if
potential false positives such as dust storms or bolide impacts can be ruled
out. Furthermore, because scenarios exist in which O2 can form abiotically in
the absence of volcanic activity, a detection of transient aerosols that can be
linked to volcanism, along with a detection of O2, would be a more robust
biosignature than O2 alone.

""Haswell"" processor tracks the transactional read-set in the L1 (level-1), L2

Displacement or eviction of read-set entries from the cache hierarchy or
write-set entries from the L1 results in abort. We show that the placement
policies of dynamic storage allocators -- such as those found in common
""malloc"" implementations -- can influence the L1 conflict miss rate in the L1.
Conflict misses -- sometimes called mapping misses -- arise because of less
than ideal associativity and represent imbalanced distribution of active memory
blocks over the set of available L1 indices. Under transactional execution
conflict misses may manifest as aborts, representing wasted or futile effort
instead of a simple stall as would occur in normal execution mode.
  Furthermore, when HTM is used for transactional lock elision (TLE),
persistent aborts arising from conflict misses can force the offending thread
through the so-called ""slow path"". The slow path is undesirable as the thread
must acquire the lock and run the critical section in normal execution mode,
precluding the concurrent execution of threads in the ""fast path"" that monitor
that same lock and run their critical sections in transactional mode. For a
given lock, multiple threads can concurrently use the transactional fast path,
but at most one thread can use the non-transactional slow path at any given
time. Threads in the slow path preclude safe concurrent fast path execution.
Aborts rising from placement policies and L1 index imbalance can thus result in
loss of concurrency and reduced aggregate throughput.

The persistence of recognition accuracy of three of the most commonly used

adults. However, persistence of biometric recognition accuracy has not been
studied systematically for children in the age group of 0-4 years. Given that
very young children are often uncooperative and do not comprehend or follow
instructions, in our opinion, among all biometric modalities, fingerprints are
the most viable for recognizing children. This is primarily because it is
easier to capture fingerprints of young children compared to other biometric
traits, e.g., iris, where a child needs to stare directly towards the camera to
initiate iris capture. In this report, we detail our initiative to investigate
the persistence of fingerprint recognition for children in the age group of 0-4
years. Based on preliminary results obtained for the data collected in the
first phase of our study, use of fingerprints for recognition of 0-4 year-old

sampling of rotationally invariant linear operators. This grid is conceptually
similar to the Gauss-Legendre (GL) grid, aligning sample points with
iso-latitude rings located on Legendre polynomial zeros. Unlike the GL grid,
however, the number of grid points per ring varies as a function of latitude,
avoiding expensive over-sampling near the poles and ensuring nearly equal sky
area per grid point. The ratio between the number of grid points in two
neighbouring rings is required to be a low-order rational number (3, 2, 1, 4/3,
5/4 or 6/5) to maintain a high degree of symmetries. Our main motivation for
this grid is to solve linear systems using multi-grid methods, and to construct
efficient preconditioners through pixel-space sampling of the linear operator
in question. The GL grid is not suitable for these purposes due to its massive
over-sampling near the poles, leading to nearly degenerate linear systems,
while HEALPix, another commonly used spherical grid, exhibits few symmetries,
and is therefore computationally inefficient for these purposes. As a benchmark
and representative example, we compute a preconditioner for a linear system
with both HEALPix and SymPix that involves the operator $D + B^T N^{-1} B$,
where $B$ and $D$ may be described as both local and rotationally invariant
operators, and $N$ is diagonal in pixel domain. For a bandwidth limit of
$\ell_\text{max}=3000$, we find that SymPix, due to its higher number of
internal symmetries, yields average speed-ups of 360 and 23 for $B^T N^{-1} B$

influential users usually get much more retweets, replies, and mentions than

rate depends very strongly on the inter-nuclear separation. That dependence

critical distance. This phenomenon was first demonstrated theoretically in H2+
and became known as charge-resonance enhanced ionization (CREI, in reference to
a proposed physical mechanism) or simply enhanced ionisation (EI). All
theoretical models of this phenomenon predict a double-peak structure in the
R-dependent ionization rate of H2+. However, such double-peak structure has
never been observed experimentally. It was even suggested that it is impossible
to observe due to fast motion of the nuclear wavepackets. Here we report a

is seen when the probe is polarized perpendicular to the pump.

  Data Retrieval",,,"10.1109/TMC.2017.2696009",,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a mobile network, wireless data broadcast over $m$ channels (frequencies)
is a powerful means for distributed dissemination of data to clients who access
the channels through multi-antennae equipped on their mobile devices. The
$\delta$-antennae largest weight data retrieval ($\delta$ALWDR) problem is to
compute a schedule for downloading a subset of data items that has a maximum
total weight using $\delta$ antennae in a given time interval. In this paper,
we propose a ratio $1-\frac{1}{e}-\epsilon$ approximation algorithm for the
$\delta$-antennae largest weight data retrieval ($\delta$ALWDR) problem that
has the same ratio as the known result but a significantly improved time
complexity of $O(2^{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\frac{1}{\epsilon}m^{7}T^{3.5}L)$ from
$O(\epsilon^{3.5}m^{\frac{3.5}{\epsilon}}T^{3.5}L)$ when $\delta=1$
\cite{lu2014data}. To our knowledge, our algorithm represents the first ratio
$1-\frac{1}{e}-\epsilon$ approximation solution to $\delta$ALWDR for the
general case of arbitrary $\delta$. To achieve this, we first give a ratio
$1-\frac{1}{e}$ algorithm for the $\gamma$-separated $\delta$ALWDR
($\delta$A$\gamma$LWDR) with runtime $O(m^{7}T^{3.5}L)$, under the assumption
that every data item appears at most once in each segment of
$\delta$A$\gamma$LWDR, for any input of maximum length $L$ on $m$ channels in
$T$ time slots. Then, we show that we can retain the same ratio for
$\delta$A$\gamma$LWDR without this assumption at the cost of increased time
complexity to $O(2^{\gamma}m^{7}T^{3.5}L)$. This result immediately yields an
approximation solution of same ratio and time complexity for $\delta$ALWDR,
presenting a significant improvement of the known time complexity of ratio
$1-\frac{1}{e}-\epsilon$ approximation to the problem.

they estimate the accuracy of every item up to error
$O\left(\sqrt{\log(d)/(\epsilon^2n)}\right)$ where $\epsilon$ is the privacy

The underlying assumption is that such signals admit a sparse representation in
a frequency domain related to the structure of the graph, which is captured by
the so-called graph-shift operator. Most of the works that have looked at this
problem have focused on using the value of the signal observed at a subset of
nodes to recover the signal in the entire graph. Differently, the sampling
scheme proposed here uses as input observations taken at a single node. The
observations correspond to sequential applications of the graph-shift operator,
which are linear combinations of the information gathered by the neighbors of
the node. When the graph corresponds to a directed cycle (which is the support
of time-varying signals), our method is equivalent to the classical sampling in
the time domain. When the graph is more general, we show that the Vandermonde
structure of the sampling matrix, which is critical to guarantee recovery when
sampling time-varying signals, is preserved. Sampling and interpolation are
analyzed first in the absence of noise and then noise is considered. We then
study the recovery of the sampled signal when the specific set of frequencies
that is active is not known. Moreover, we present a more general sampling
scheme, under which, either our aggregation approach or the alternative
approach of sampling a graph signal by observing the value of the signal at a
subset of nodes can be both viewed as particular cases. The last part of the

precision matrix. It is now well understood that when the underlying
distribution is Gaussian, the columns of the precision matrix can be estimated
independently form one another by solving linear regression problems under
sparsity constraints. This approach leads to a computationally efficient
strategy for estimating the precision matrix that starts by estimating the
regression vectors, then estimates the diagonal entries of the precision matrix
and, in a final step, combines these estimators for getting estimators of the
off-diagonal entries. While the step of estimating the regression vector has
been intensively studied over the past decade, the problem of deriving
statistically accurate estimators of the diagonal entries has received much
less attention. The goal of the present paper is to fill this gap by presenting
four estimators---that seem the most natural ones---of the diagonal entries of
the precision matrix and then performing a comprehensive empirical evaluation
of these estimators. The estimators under consideration are the residual
variance, the relaxed maximum likelihood, the symmetry-enforced maximum
likelihood and the penalized maximum likelihood. We show, both theoretically
and empirically, that when the aforementioned regression vectors are estimated
without error, the symmetry-enforced maximum likelihood estimator has the
smallest estimation error. However, in a more realistic setting when the
regression vector is estimated by a sparsity-favoring computationally efficient
method, the qualities of the estimators become relatively comparable with a
slight advantage for the residual variance estimator.

order to minimize outage probability, power splitting ratios have been
dynamically optimized according to full channel state information (CSI) and
partial CSI, respectively. Under strong loop interference, the proposed full
CSI-based and partial CSI-based power splitting schemes achieve the better
outage performance than the fixed power splitting scheme, whereas the partial
CSI-based power splitting scheme can ensure competitive outage performance
without requiring CSI of the second-hop link. It is also observed that the
worst outage performance is achieved when the relay is located midway between
the source and destination, whereas the outage performance of partial CSI-based

magnetic field, do not follow the symmetry of the spatial modulation. Moreover,
this phenomenology is found to depend on the relative tilt of magnetic field
and on the SOC type: a) when only Rashba SOC exists and the magnetic field is
tilted in the direction of the superlattice b) Dresselhaus SOC exists and the
magnetic field is tilted in the direction perpendicular to the superlattice.
Consequently, measurable properties of the modulated system become anisotropic
in a tilted magnetic field when the field is conically rotated around the $z$
axis, at a fixed polar angle, as we demonstrate by calculating the resistivity
and the magnetization.

but the selection of relevant terms becomes difficult if higher order
interactions are needed. In contrast, tree-based methods also known as
recursive partitioning are explicitly designed to model a specific form of
interaction but with their focus on interaction tend to neglect the main
effects. The method proposed here focusses on the main effects of categorical
predictors by using tree type methods to obtain clusters. In particular when
the predictor has many categories one wants to know which of the categories
have to be distinguished with respect to their effect on the response. The
tree-structured approach allows to detect clusters of categories that share the
same effect while letting other variables, in particular metric variables, have
a linear or additive effect on the response. An algorithm for the fitting is
proposed and various stopping criteria are evaluated. The preferred stopping
criterion is based on $p$-values representing a conditional inference
procedure. In addition, stability of clusters are investigated and the
relevance of variables is investigated by bootstrap methods. Several
applications show the usefulness of tree-structured clustering and a small
simulation study demonstrates that the fitting procedure works well.

stars (NSs) or black holes (BHs). The dipole radiation of nascent NSs has
usually been neglected in explaining supernovae (SNe) with peak absolute
magnitude $M_{\rm peak}$ in any band are $\gtrsim -19.5$~mag, while the
$^{56}$Ni can be neglected in fitting most type-Ic superluminous supernovae
(SLSNe Ic) whose $M_{\rm peak}$ in any band are $\lesssim -21$~mag, since the
luminosity from a magnetar (highly magnetized NS) can outshine that from a
moderate amount of $^{56}$Ni. For luminous SNe Ic with $-21 \lesssim M_{\rm
peak}\lesssim -19.5$~mag, however, both contributions from $^{56}$Ni and NSs
cannot be neglected without serious modeling, since they are not SLSNe and the
$^{56}$Ni mass could be up to $\sim 0.5 M_{\odot}$. In this paper we propose a
unified model that contain contributions from both $^{56}$Ni and a nascent NS.
We select three luminous SNe Ic-BL, SN~2010ay, SN~2006nx, and SN~14475, and
show that, if these SNe are powered by $^{56}$Ni, the ratio of $M_{\rm Ni}$ to
$M_{\rm ej}$ are unrealistic. Alternatively, we invoke the magnetar model and
the hybrid ($^{56}$Ni + NS) model and find that they can fit the observations,
indicating that our models are valid and necessary for luminous SNe Ic. Owing
to the lack of late-time photometric data, we cannot break the parameter
degeneracy and thus distinguish among the model parameters, but we can expect
that future multi-epoch observations of luminous SNe can provide stringent
constraints on $^{56}$Ni yields and the parameters of putative magnetars.

A that can be decomposed as A = LU, where L is lower triangular and U is upper
triangular. Updating these selected elements of A-1 requires restricted
collective communications among a subset of processors within each column or
row communication group created by a block cyclic distribution of L and U. We
describe how this type of restricted collective communication can be
implemented by using asynchronous point-to-point MPI communication functions
combined with a binary tree based data propagation scheme. Because multiple
restricted collective communications may take place at the same time in the
parallel selected inversion algorithm, we need to use a heuristic to prevent
processors participating in multiple collective communications from receiving
too many messages. This heuristic allows us to reduce communication load
imbalance and improve the overall scalability of the selected inversion
algorithm. For instance, when 6,400 processors are used, we observe over 5x
speedup for test matrices. It also mitigates the performance variability
introduced by an inhomogeneous network topology.

simulations. We simulate 280,000 stars, each of which is assigned a mass, a
rotational period, and a mass accretion rate. The mass accretion rate depends
on mass and time, following power-laws indices 1.4 and -1.5, respectively. A
mass-dependent accretion threshold is defined below which a star is considered
as diskless, which results in a distribution of disk lifetimes that matches
observations. Stars are evolved at constant angular spin rate while accreting
and at constant angular momentum when they become diskless. We recover the
bimodal period distribution seen in several young clusters. The short period
peak consists mostly of diskless stars and the long period one is mainly
populated by accreting stars. Both distributions present a long tail towards
long periods and a population of slowly rotating diskless stars is observed at
all ages. We reproduce the observed correlations between disk fraction and spin
rate, as well as between IR excess and rotational period. The period-mass
relation we derive from the simulations exhibits the same global trend as
observed in young clusters only if we release the disk locking assumption for
the lowest mass stars. We find that the time evolution of median specific
angular momentum follows a power law index of -0.65 for accreting stars and of
-0.53 for diskless stars, a shallower slope that results from a wide
distribution of disk lifetimes. Using observationally-documented distributions
of disk lifetimes, mass accretion rates, and initial rotation periods, and
evolving an initial population from 1 to 12 Myr, we reproduce the main
characteristics of pre-main sequence angular momentum evolution, which supports
the disk locking hypothesis. (abridged)

  Distribution","25 pages, 9 figures",,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The gist of the quickest change-point detection problem is to detect the
presence of a change in the statistical behavior of a series of sequentially
made observations, and do so in an optimal
detection-speed-vs.-""false-positive""-risk manner. When optimality is understood
either in the generalized Bayesian sense or as defined in Shiryaev's
multi-cyclic setup, the so-called Shiryaev-Roberts (SR) detection procedure is
known to be the ""best one can do"", provided, however, that the observations'
pre- and post-change distributions are both fully specified. We consider a more
realistic setup, viz. one where the post-change distribution is assumed known
only up to a parameter, so that the latter may be ""misspecified"". The question
of interest is the sensitivity (or robustness) of the otherwise ""best"" SR
procedure with respect to a possible misspecification of the post-change
distribution parameter. To answer this question, we provide a case study where,
in a specific Gaussian scenario, we allow the SR procedure to be ""out of tune""
in the way of the post-change distribution parameter, and numerically assess
the effect of the ""mistuning"" on Shiryaev's (multi-cyclic) Stationary Average
Detection Delay delivered by the SR procedure. The comprehensive quantitative
robustness characterization of the SR procedure obtained in the study can be
used to develop the respective theory as well as to provide a rational for
practical design of the SR procedure. The overall qualitative conclusion of the
study is an expected one: the SR procedure is less (more) robust for less
(more) contrast changes and for lower (higher) levels of the false alarm risk.

seismic and infrasound fields will pose one of the main sensitivity limitations
in low-frequency, ground-based, gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. It was
estimated that this noise foreground needs to be suppressed by about 3 -- 5
orders of magnitude in the frequency band 10\,mHz to 1\,Hz, which will be
extremely challenging. In this article, we present a new approach that greatly
facilitates cancellation of gravity noise in full-tensor GW detectors. The
method uses optimal combinations of tensor channels and environmental sensors
such as seismometers and microphones to reduce gravity noise. It makes explicit
use of the direction of propagation of a GW, and can therefore either be
implemented in directional searches for GWs or in observations of known
sources. We show that suppression of the Newtonian-noise foreground is greatly
facilitated using the extra strain channels in full-tensor GW detectors. Only a
modest number of auxiliary, high-sensitivity environmental sensors are required
to achieve noise suppression by a few orders of magnitude.

scenario, a general criterion for the design of full large-scale diversity

Based on our criterion, FLDSC is attained if and only if all the entries of the
space coding matrix are positive. Particularly for $2\times 2$ MIMO-OWC with
unipolar pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), a closed-form linear FLDSC
satisfying this criterion is attained by smartly taking advantage of some
available properties as well as by developing some new interesting properties
on Farey sequences in number theory to rigorously attack the continuous and
discrete variables mixed max-min problem. In fact, this specific design not
only proves that a repetition code (RC) is the best linear FLDSC, but also
uncovers a significant difference between MIMO radio frequency (RF)
communications and MIMO-OWC that space-only transmission is sufficient for a
full diversity achievement. Computer simulations demonstrate that FLDSC
substantially outperforms spatial multiplexing with the same total optical
power and spectral efficiency and the latter obtains only the small-scale

us to obtain a closed form of quantum discord and quantum work deficit for
several classes of states, with a low error. We show that the computational
error caused by the constraint over the complete set of local measurements
reduces fast with an increase in the size of the restricted set, implying
usefulness of constrained optimization, especially with the increase of

scales with the system size, taking into account a set of plausible

that the resource required to optimize quantum work deficit is usually higher
than that required for quantum discord. We also demonstrate that minimization
of quantum discord and quantum work deficit is easier in the case of two-qubit
mixed states of fixed ranks and with positive partial transpose in comparison
to the corresponding states having non-positive partial transpose. Applying the
methodology to quantum spin models, we show that the constrained optimization
can be used with advantage in analyzing such systems in quantum

observables along the three Cartesian coordinates, and thereby we obtain

Consequently it is time consuming, costly and not scalable. This has resulted

  In this paper, we show that by leveraging structural and content-based
