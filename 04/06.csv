temperature $\beta$ and other quantities relevant for the computation of

behaviors of those quantities are represented by the linear differential
equations with constant coefficients which are related to critical exponents.
We estimate the critical temperature and exponents via an expansion in the
inverse powers of the mass under the use of $\delta$-expansion. The critical

critical exponents are also estimated in biased and unbiased self-contained way

effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about
the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the
population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to
determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to
test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our
method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that
was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating
inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised
machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal
is to build a model of the relationship between a unit's attributes and an
observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by
cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples,
in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best
predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is
tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's
outcome. The challenge is that the ""ground truth"" for a causal effect is not
observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or
without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious
how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been
accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for
this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which
they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We
then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a
search engine.

further expands the application of FBMC to massive MIMO by applying frequency

accurate equalization. Hence, higher number of bits per symbol can be
transmitted and the bandwidth of each subcarrier can be widened. Widening the
bandwidth of each subcarrier leads to (i) higher bandwidth efficiency; (ii)
lower complexity; (iii) lower sensitivity to carrier frequency offset (CFO);
(iv) reduced peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR); and (iv) reduced latency. All
these appealing advantages have a direct impact on the digital as well as

characterize spatial variation. Generally, this monitoring takes place at a
limited number of fixed sampling points. The alternative sampling methodology
explored in this paper involves high density sampling from an onboard
flow-through water analysis system (Dataflow). Dataflow has the potential to
provide better spatial resolution of water quality features because it
generates many closely spaced (< 10 m) measurements. Regardless of the
measurement technique, parameter values at unsampled locations must be
interpolated from nearby measurement points in order to generate a
comprehensive picture of spatial variations. Standard Euclidean interpolations
in coastal settings tend to yield inaccurate results because they extend
through barriers in the landscape such as peninsulas, islands, and submerged
banks. We recently developed a method for non-Euclidean interpolation by
inverse path distance weighting (IPDW) in order to account for these barriers.
The algorithms were implemented as part of an R package and made available from
R repositories. The combination of IPDW with Dataflow provided more accurate
estimates of salinity patterning relative to Euclidean inverse distance
weighting (IDW). IPDW was notably more accurate than IDW in the presence of
intense spatial gradients.

combinatorial invariant is an integer partition of 2d -- 2, consisting of the

Hurwitz passport. The realization problem of Hurwitz passports remain largely
open till today. In this article, we introduce two different types of finer

their realization problem by showing that a map, or a matrix, is realized by a

from compressed linear measurements. The underlying idea of this algorithm is
to closely approximate the rank function with a smooth function of singular
values, and then minimize the resulting approximation subject to the linear
constraints. The accuracy of the approximation is controlled via a scaling
parameter $\delta$, where a smaller $\delta$ corresponds to a more accurate
fitting. The consequent optimization problem for any finite $\delta$ is
nonconvex. Therefore, in order to decrease the risk of ending up in local
minima, a series of optimizations is performed, starting with optimizing a
rough approximation (a large $\delta$) and followed by successively optimizing
finer approximations of the rank with smaller $\delta$'s. To solve the
optimization problem for any $\delta > 0$, it is converted to a new program in
which the cost is a function of two auxiliary positive semidefinete variables.
The paper shows that this new program is concave and applies a
majorize-minimize technique to solve it which, in turn, leads to a few convex
optimization iterations. This optimization scheme is also equivalent to a
reweighted Nuclear Norm Minimization (NNM), where weighting update depends on
the used approximating function. For any $\delta > 0$, we derive a necessary
and sufficient condition for the exact recovery which are weaker than those
corresponding to NNM. On the numerical side, the proposed algorithm is compared
to NNM and a reweighted NNM in solving affine rank minimization and matrix
completion problems showing its considerable and consistent superiority in
terms of success rate, especially, when the number of measurements decreases
toward the lower-bound for the unique representation.

statistical model for the orbit distribution of planets formed by this process,
based on the sheared-sheet approximation and the ansatz that the planets
explore uniformly all of the stable region of phase space. The model provides
analytic predictions for the distribution of eccentricities and semimajor axis
differences, correlations between orbital elements of nearby planets, and the
complete N-planet distribution function, in terms of a single parameter, the
""dynamical temperature"", that is determined by the planetary masses. The
predicted properties are generally consistent with N-body simulations of the
giant-impact phase and with the distribution of semimajor axis differences in
the Kepler catalog of extrasolar planets. A similar model may apply to the
orbits of giant planets if these orbits are determined mainly by dynamical
evolution after the planets have formed and the gas disk has disappeared.

\mathsf{CF}(\mathcal{C})$ for an object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ by using an
adjunction between $\mathcal{C}$ and its monoidal center
$\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. We also develop the integral theory in a unimodular
finite tensor category by using the same adjunction. By utilizing these tools,
we extend some results in the character theory of finite-dimensional Hopf
algebras to this category-theoretical setting. Our main result is that the map
$\mathsf{ch}: \mathsf{Gr}_k(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathsf{CF}(\mathcal{C})$ given by
taking the internal character is a well-defined injective algebra map, where
$\mathsf{Gr}_k(\mathcal{C})$ is the scalar extension of the Grothendieck ring
of $\mathcal{C}$ to $k$. Moreover, under the assumption that $\mathcal{C}$ is
unimodular, the map $\mathsf{ch}$ is an isomorphism if and only if
$\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple.
  As an application, we show that the algebra $\mathsf{Gr}_{k}(\mathcal{C})$ is
semisimple if $\mathcal{C}$ is a non-degenerate pivotal fusion category. If,
moreover, $\mathsf{Gr}_k(\mathcal{C})$ is commutative, then the character table
of $\mathcal{C}$ is defined based on the integral theory. It turns out that the
character table is obtained from the $S$-matrix if $\mathcal{C}$ is a modular
tensor category. Generalizing corresponding results in the finite group theory,
we prove the orthogonality relations and the integrality.

in powers of the electric Reynolds number which signifies the importance of the
charge relaxation time scale as compared to the convective time scale. We show
that in the presence of electric field either in the sedimenting direction or
orthogonal to it, there is a change in the drop velocity only in the direction
of sedimentation due to an asymmetric charge distribution in the same
direction. However, in the presence of an electric field applied in both the
directions, and depending on the permittivities and conductivities of the two
fluids, we obtain a non-intuitive lateral migration of drop in addition to the
buoyancy driven sedimentation. These dynamical features can be effectively used
for manipulating drops in a controlled electro-fluidic environment.

vital importance in explaining the conductivity of gapless graphene therefore
we first worked out the behaviour of the temperature dependent polarization
function for gapped graphene as a function of wave vector and band gap,
respectively. Polarization of gapped graphene has been compared with that of
gapless graphene, bilayer graphene and 2DEG to see the effects of gap. It is
found that the gapped graphene polarization function exhibits a strong
dependence on temperature, wave vector and band gap and the effect translates
to the conductivity of gapped graphene. The nature of conductivity in gapped
graphene is observed to be non monotonic ranging from good to poor to semi
conducting. We also find that the conductivity computed as a function of
temperature by averaging over quasi-particle energy significantly differs from
that computed at Fermi energy, suggesting that a notable contribution to
temperature dependent conductivity is made by electrons close to the Fermi

understood range in the amount of hot, X-ray-emitting gas they contain.To
investigate the origin of this diversity, we studied the hot gas properties of
all 42 early-type galaxies in the multiwavelength ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ survey that
have sufficiently deep {\sl Chandra} X-ray observations. We related their hot
gas properties to a number of internal and external physical quantities. To
characterize the amount of hot gas relative to the stellar light, we use the
ratio of the gaseous X-ray luminosity to the stellar $K$-band luminosity,
$L_{X_{\rm gas}}/L_K$; we also use the deviations of $L_{X_{\rm gas}}$ from the
best-fit $L_{X_{\rm gas}}$--$L_K$ relation (denoted $\Delta L_{X_{\rm gas}}$).
We quantitatively confirm previous suggestions that various effects conspire to
produce the large scatter in the observed $L_X/L_K$ relation. In particular, we
find that the deviations $\Delta L_{X_{\rm gas}}$ are most strongly positively
correlated with the (low rates of) star formation and the hot gas temperatures
in the sample galaxies. This suggests that mild stellar feedback may energize
the gas without pushing it out of the host galaxies. We also find that galaxies
in high galaxy density environments tend to be massive slow-rotators, while
galaxies in low galaxy density environments tend to be low mass, fast-rotators.
Moreover, cold gas in clusters and fields may have different origins. The star
formation rate increases with cold gas mass for field galaxies but it appears
to be uncorrelated with cold gas for cluster galaxies.

arbitrary number of agents moving in a bounded region of interest. We assume
that the network contains \textit{at least one} agent with known location
(hereinafter referred to as an anchor), and each agent measures a noisy version
of its motion and the distances to the nearby agents. We provide
a~\emph{geometric approach}, which allows each agent to: (i) continually update
the distances to the locations where it has exchanged information with the
other nodes in the past; and (ii) measure the distance between a neighbor and
any such locations. Based on this approach, we provide a \emph{linear update}
to find the locations of an arbitrary number of mobile agents when they follow
some convexity in their deployment and motion.
  Since the agents are mobile, they may not be able to find nearby nodes
(agents and/or anchors) to implement a distributed algorithm. To address this
issue, we introduce the notion of a \emph{virtual convex hull} with the help of
the aforementioned geometric approach. In particular, each agent keeps track of
a virtual convex hull of other nodes, which may not physically exist, and
updates its location with respect to its neighbors in the virtual hull. We show
that the corresponding localization algorithm, in the absence of noise, can be
abstracted as a Linear Time-Varying (LTV) system, with non-deterministic system
matrices, which asymptotically tracks the true locations of the agents. We
provide simulations to verify the analytical results and evaluate the
performance of the algorithm in the presence of noise on the motion as well as
on the distance measurements.

distance-dependence of effective force is known as the hydrophobic force law
(HFL). We explore the microscopic origin of HFL by studying distance-dependent
attraction between two parallel rods immersed in 2D Mercedes Benz model of
water. This model is found to exhibit a well-defined HFL. Although the
phenomenon is conventionally explained by density-dependent theories, we
identify orientation, rather than density, as the relevant order parameter. The
range of density variation is noticeably shorter than that of orientational
heterogeneity. The latter is comparable to the observed distances of
hydrophobic force. At large separation, attraction between the rods arises
primarily from a destructive interference among the inwardly propagating
oppositely oriented heterogeneity generated in water by the two rods. As the
rods are brought closer, the interference increases leading to a decrease in
heterogeneity and concomitant decrease in free energy of the system, giving
rise to the effective attraction. We notice formation of hexagonal ice-like
structures at the onset of attractive region which suggests that metastable
free energy minimum may play a role in the origin of HFL.

materials. Many encouraging approaches have been proposed to combine vdW
interactions with standard approximate DFT calculations. Despite many vdW
studies, there is no consensus on the reliability of vdW methods. To help
further development of vdW methods, we have assessed various vdW functionals
through the calculation of structural prop- erties at equilibrium, such as
lattice constants, bulk moduli, and cohesive energies, for bulk solids,
including alkali, alkali-earth, and transition metals, with BCC, FCC, and
diamond structures as the ground state structure. These results provide
important information for the vdW-related materials research, which is
essential for designing and optimizing materials systems for desired physical
and chemical properties.

performances in the human parsing task, namely segmenting a human image into
several semantic regions (e.g., hat, bag, left arm, face). In this work, we aim
to develop a new solution with the advantages of both methodologies, namely
supervision from annotated data and the flexibility to use newly annotated
(possibly uncommon) images, and present a quasi-parametric human parsing model.
Under the classic K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)-based nonparametric framework, the
parametric Matching Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) is proposed to predict
the matching confidence and displacements of the best matched region in the
testing image for a particular semantic region in one KNN image. Given a
testing image, we first retrieve its KNN images from the
annotated/manually-parsed human image corpus. Then each semantic region in each
KNN image is matched with confidence to the testing image using M-CNN, and the
matched regions from all KNN images are further fused, followed by a superpixel
smoothing procedure to obtain the ultimate human parsing result. The M-CNN
differs from the classic CNN in that the tailored cross image matching filters
are introduced to characterize the matching between the testing image and the
semantic region of a KNN image. The cross image matching filters are defined at
different convolutional layers, each aiming to capture a particular range of
displacements. Comprehensive evaluations over a large dataset with 7,700
annotated human images well demonstrate the significant performance gain from
the quasi-parametric model over the state-of-the-arts, for the human parsing
task.

AGN, which follows $L_R = 10^{-5}L_X$ observed also in stellar coronae,
suggests an association of both X-ray and radio sources with the accretion disk
corona. Observing RQ AGN at higher (mm-wave) frequencies, where synchrotron
self absorption is diminished, and smaller regions can be probed, is key to
exploring this association. Eight RQ AGN, selected based on their high X-ray
brightness and variability, were observed at 95 GHz with the CARMA and ATCA
telescopes. All targets were detected at the $1-10$ mJy level. Emission excess
at 95~GHz of up to $\times 7$ is found with respect to archival low-frequency
steep spectra, suggesting a compact, optically-thick core superimposed on the
more extended structures that dominate at low frequencies. Though unresolved,
the 95 GHz fluxes imply optically thick source sizes of $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ pc,
or $\sim 10 - 1000$ gravitational radii. The present sources lie tightly along
an $L_R$ (95 GHz) = $10^{-4}L_X$ (2$-$10 keV) correlation, analogous to that of
stellar coronae and RQ AGN at 5 GHz, while RL AGN are shown to have higher $L_R
/ L_X$ ratios. The present observations argue that simultaneous mm-wave and
X-ray monitoring of RQ AGN features a promising method for understanding
accretion disk coronal emission.

Lennard-Jones fluid confined in a random porous matrix formed by hard sphere
particles. In order to describe the reference system needed in this
perturbation scheme, the extension of the scaled particle theory (SPT) is used.
The recent progress in the development of SPT approach for a hard sphere fluid
in a hard sphere matrix allows us to obtain very accurate results for
thermodynamic properties in such a system. Hence, we combine the BH
perturbation theory with the SPT approach to derive expressions for the
chemical potential and the pressure of a confined fluid. Using the obtained
expressions, the liquid-vapour phase diagrams of a LJ fluid in HS matrix are
built from the phase equilibrium conditions. Therefore, the effect of matrix
porosity and a size of matrix particles is considered. It is shown that a
decrease of matrix porosity lowers both the critical temperature and the
critical density, while the phase diagram becomes narrower. An increase of a
size of matrix particles leads to an increase of the critical temperature. From
the comparison it is observed that the results obtained from the theory are in
agreement with computer simulations. The approach proposed in the present study
can be extended to the case of anisotropic fluid particles in HS matrices.

Galactic disc. However, there is a deficiency of radial velocity and chemical
abundance determinations for open clusters in the literature. Aims: We intend
to increase the number of determinations of radial velocities and metallicities
from spectroscopy for open clusters. Methods: We acquired medium-resolution
spectra (R~8000) in the infrared region Ca II triplet lines (~8500 AA) for
several stars in five open clusters with the long-slit IDS spectrograph on the
2.5~m Isaac Newton Telescope (Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, Spain).
Radial velocities were obtained by cross-correlation fitting techniques. The
relationships available in the literature between the strength of infrared Ca
II lines and metallicity were also used to derive the metallicity for each
cluster. Results: We obtain <V_r> = 48.6+/-3.4, -58.4+/-6.8, 26.0+/-4.3 and
-65.3+/-3.2 km s-1 for Berkeley 23, NGC 559, NGC 6603 and NGC 7245,
respectively. We found [Fe/H] =-0.25+/-0.14 and -0.15+/-0.18 for NGC 559 and
NGC 7245, respectively. Berkeley 23 has a low metallicity, [Fe/H]
=-0.42+/-0.13, similar to other open clusters in the outskirts of the Galactic
disc. In contrast, we derived a high metallicity ([Fe/H] =+0.43+/-0.15) for NGC
6603, which places this system among the most metal rich known open clusters.
To our knowledge, this is the first determination of radial velocities and
metallicities from spectroscopy for these clusters, except NGC 6603, for which
radial velocities had been previously determined. We have also analysed ten
stars in the line of sight to King 1. Because of the large dispersion obtained
in both radial velocity and metallicity, we cannot be sure that we have sampled
true cluster members.

topology. For this purpose, we construct the two possible tight-binding models
with finite SOI by referring the bandstructures given by different ARPES
groups. In addition, we extend the gap equation for multiorbital systems with
finite SOI, and calculate the gap functions by applying the orbital-spin
fluctuation theory. On the basis of both SOI-induced band structures, main
characteristics of the gap structure in LiFeAs are naturally reproduced only in
the presence of strong inter-orbital interactions between (xz/yz - xy)
orbitals. Thus, the experimental gap structure in LiFeAs is a strong evidence
for the orbital-fluctuation pairing mechanism.

scatter matrices. The key advantages of these estimators are twofold. First,
they guarantee by construction a good conditioning of the estimate and second,
being a derivative of robust Tyler estimators, they inherit their robustness
properties, notably their resilience to the presence of outliers. Nevertheless,
one major problem that poses the use of RTEs in practice is represented by the
question of setting the regularization parameter $\rho$. While a high value of
$\rho$ is likely to push all the eigenvalues away from zero, it comes at the
cost of a larger bias with respect to the population covariance matrix. A deep
understanding of the statistics of RTEs is essential to come up with
appropriate choices for the regularization parameter. This is not an easy task
and might be out of reach, unless one considers asymptotic regimes wherein the
number of observations $n$ and/or their size $N$ increase together. First
asymptotic results have recently been obtained under the assumption that $N$
and $n$ are large and commensurable. Interestingly, no results concerning the
regime of $n$ going to infinity with $N$ fixed exist, even though the
investigation of this assumption has usually predated the analysis of the most
difficult $N$ and $n$ large case. This motivates our work. In particular, we
prove in the present paper that the RTEs converge to a deterministic matrix
when $n\to\infty$ with $N$ fixed, which is expressed as a function of the
theoretical covariance matrix. We also derive the fluctuations of the RTEs
around this deterministic matrix and establish that these fluctuations converge
in distribution to a multivariate Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a
covariance depending on the population covariance and the parameter $\rho$.

justify the consistency of various popular models in the literature. Assuming
analyticity of the exact model, we suggest that a controlled expansion around
the constant velocity, uniform headway ""ground state"" is the proper way of
constructing various different effective models. Assuming a unique ground state
for any fixed average density, we discuss the universal properties of the
resulting effective model, focusing on the emergent quantities of the coupled
non-linear ODEs. These include the maximum and minimum headway that give the
coexistence curve in the phase diagram, as well as an emergent intrinsic scale
that characterizes the strength of interaction between clusters, leading to
non-trivial cluster statistics when the unstable ground state is randomly
perturbed. Utilizing the universal properties of the emergent quantities, a
simple algorithm for constructing an effective traffic model is also presented.
The algorithm tunes the model with statistically well-defined quantities
extracted from the flow-density plot, and the resulting effective model
naturally captures and predicts many quantitative and qualitative empirical
features of the highway traffic, especially in the presence of an on-ramp
bottleneck. The simplicity of the effective model provides strong evidence that
stochasticity, diversity of vehicle types and modeling of complicated
individual driving behaviors are \emph{not} fundamental to many observations of
the complex spatiotemporal patterns in the real traffic dynamics. We also
propose the nature of the congested phase can be well characterized by the long
lasting transient states of the effective model, from which the wide moving
jams evolve.

to give rise to three types of service match: Exact, Super and Partial match.
Based on matches of all three types, different kinds of compositions are

orthogonal subspace. This is the subspace that is orthogonal to the signal
subspace spanned by the columns of the generalized Vandermonde matrix of modes
in sparse or co-prime arrays. This characterization is derived in a form that
allows us to adapt modern methods of linear prediction and approximate least
squares, such as iterative quadratic maximum likelihood (IQML), for estimating
mode parameters. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the
validity of the proposed modal estimation methods, and to compare the fidelity
of modal estimation with sparse and co-prime arrays, versus SNR. Our
calculations of Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds allow us to analyze the loss in
performance sustained by sparse and co-prime arrays that are compressions of
uniform linear arrays.

lattice are investigated by a quantum Monte Carlo simulation, from the
viewpoint of fractionalization of quantum $S=1/2$ spins into two types of
Majorana fermions, itinerant and localized. In this system, the entropy is
released successively at two well-separated $T$ scales, as a clear indication
of the thermal fractionalization. We show that the high-$T$ crossover, which is
driven by itinerant Majorana fermions, is closely related with the development
of nearest-neighbor spin correlations. On the other hand, the low-$T$ crossover
originates in thermal fluctuations of fluxes composed of localized Majorana
fermions, by which the spectrum of itinerant Majorana fermions is significantly
disturbed. As a consequence, in the intermediate-$T$ range between the two
crossovers, the system exhibits $T$-linear behavior in the specific heat and
coherent transport of Majorana fermions, which are unexpected for the Dirac
semimetallic spectrum in the low-$T$ limit. We also show that the flux
fluctuations tend to open an energy gap in the Majorana spectrum near the
gapless-gapped phase boundary. Our results indicate that the fractionalization
is experimentally observable in the specific heat, spin correlations, and
transport properties.

set the renormalization scale of the running coupling unambiguously at each
finite order. The elimination of the uncertainty in setting the renormalization
scale in pQCD will greatly increase the precision of collider tests of the
Standard Model and the sensitivity to new phenomena. Renormalization group
invariance requires that predictions for observables must also be independent
on the choice of the renormalization scheme. The well-known
Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) approach cannot be easily extended beyond
next-to-next-to-leading order of pQCD. Several suggestions have been proposed
to extend the BLM approach to all-orders. In this paper we discuss two distinct
methods. One is based on the ""Principle of Maximum Conformality"" (PMC), which
provides a systematic all-orders method to eliminate the scale- and scheme-
ambiguities of pQCD. The PMC extends the BLM procedure to all orders using
renormalization group methods; as an outcome, it significantly improves the
pQCD convergence by eliminating renormalon divergences. An alternative method
is the ""sequential extended BLM"" (seBLM) approach, which has been primarily
designed to improve the convergence of pQCD series. The seBLM, as originally
proposed, introduces auxiliary fields and follows the pattern of the
$\beta_0$-expansion to fix the renormalization scale. However, the seBLM
requires a recomputation of pQCD amplitudes including the auxiliary fields; due
to the limited availability of calculations using these auxiliary fields, the
seBLM has only been applied to a few processes at low-orders......

with a stiff EOS, $M=2.5M_\odot$ and $q=1.5$. We focus on the post-merger

gravitational wave spectrum. Although most of the merger remnants form a
hypermassive neutron star collapsing to a black hole+disk system on dynamical
timescales, stiff EOSs can eventually produce a stable massive neutron star.
Ejecta are mostly emitted around the orbital plane; favored by large mass
ratios and softer EOS. The postmerger wave spectrum is mainly characterized by
non-axisymmetric oscillations of the remnant. The stiff EOS configuration
consisting of a $1.5M_\odot$ and a $1.0M_\odot$ neutron star shows a rather
peculiar dynamics. During merger the companion star is very deformed;
about~$\sim0.03M_\odot$ of rest-mass becomes unbound from the tidal tail due
torque; and the merger remnant forms stable neutron star surrounded by a
massive accretion disk $\sim0.3M_\odot$. Similar configurations might be
particularly interesting for electromagnetic counterparts. Comparing results

$\epsilon_3$. On the other hand, it is observed that $v_4$ increases strongly
with $v_2$, and $v_5$ increases strongly with both $v_2$ and $v_3$. The trend
and strength of the $v_m$-$v_n$ correlations for $n$=4 and 5 are found to
disagree with $\epsilon_m$-$\epsilon_n$ correlations predicted by
initial-geometry models. Instead, these correlations are found to be consistent
with the combined effects of a linear contribution to $v_n$ and a nonlinear
term that is a function of $v_2^2$ or of $v_2v_3$, as predicted by hydrodynamic
models. A simple two-component fit is used to separate these two contributions.
The extracted linear and nonlinear contributions to $v_4$ and $v_5$ are found
to be consistent with previously measured event-plane correlations.

of two-lead and three-lead junctions, we show that the RG equations cannot be
expressed solely in terms of conductances. The appearing ambiguity is resolved
by choosing a certain sign defined at the level of S-matrix, but hidden in
conductances. The origin of this Z_2 symmetry is traced back to the
particle-hole symmetry of our Hamiltonian. We demonstrate two distinct RG flows
from any point in the space of conductances. The scaling exponents at the fixed
points are not affected by these observations.

strongly interacting particles, appear in many areas of physics. The
theoretical modeling of such systems is a very difficult problem. In this work
we present a theoretical framework that is based on the rigged Hilbert space
formulation. The few-body problem is solved by exact diagonalization using a
basis in which bound, resonant, and non-resonant scattering states are included
on an equal footing. Current experiments with ultracold atoms offer a
fascinating opportunity to study universal properties of few-body systems with
a high degree of control over parameters such as the external trap geometry,
the number of particles, and even the interaction strength. In particular,
particles can be allowed to tunnel out of the trap by applying a magnetic-field
gradient that effectively lowers the potential barrier. The result is a tunable
open quantum system that allows detailed studies of the tunneling mechanism. In
this Contribution we introduce our method and present results for the decay
rate of two distinguishable fermions in a one-dimensional trap as a function of
the interaction strength. We also study the numerical convergence. Many of
these results have been previously published (R. Lundmark, C. Forss\'en, and J.
Rotureau, arXiv: 1412.7175). However, in this Contribution we present several

why metagenome assemblies are not used for the analysis of metatranscriptomic

onto a de Bruijn graph of assemblies. A hash table of junction k-mers (k-mers

repeatable by other researchers. While this stance may appear to be obvious and
trivial, a variety of factors often stand in the way of making it commonplace.
Whilst there has been detailed cross-disciplinary discussions of the various
social, cultural and ideological drivers and (potential) solutions, one factor
which has had less focus is the concept of reproducibility as a technical
challenge. Specifically, that the definition of an unambiguous and measurable
standard of reproducibility would offer a significant benefit to the wider
computational science community.
  In this paper, we propose a high-level technical specification for a service
for reproducibility, presenting cyberinfrastructure and associated workflow for
a service which would enable such a specification to be verified and validated.

further speculate on the potential contribution to the wider software

predictions than the others for all values of $P_{th}$. According to the
maximum values of HSS, a performance-based weights calculated by averaging over
the sample, performed similarly to a equally weighted model. The values
$P_{th}$ for which the ensemble forecast performs the best are 25 \% for
M-class flares and 15 \% for X-class flares. When the human-adjusted
probabilities from NOAA are excluded from the ensemble, the ensemble
performance in terms of the Heidke score, is reduced.

field equations for electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Applying the
octonionic representation enables one single definition to combine some physics
contents of two fields, which were considered to be independent of each other
in the past. J. C. Maxwell applied simultaneously the vector terminology and
the quaternion analysis to depict the electromagnetic theory. This method
edified the paper to introduce the quaternion and octonion spaces into the
field theory, in order to describe the physical feature of electromagnetic and
gravitational fields, while their coordinates are able to be the complex
number. The octonion space can be separated into two subspaces, the quaternion
space and the S-quaternion space. In the quaternion space, it is able to infer
the field potential, field strength, field source, field equations, and so
forth, in the gravitational field. In the S-quaternion space, it is able to
deduce the field potential, field strength, field source, and so forth, in the
electromagnetic field. The results reveal that the quaternion space is
appropriate to describe the gravitational features; meanwhile the S-quaternion
space is proper to depict the electromagnetic features.
