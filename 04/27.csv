channel and the electronic contribution to the nematic susceptibility within
the spin-driven approach to electron nematicity of the iron based
superconductors. The spin-driven nematic phase, characterized by the broken
$C_4$ symmetry, but unbroken $O(3$) spin-rotational symmetry, is generated by
the presence of magnetic fluctuations associated with the striped phase. It
occurs as a separate phase between $T_N$ and $T_s$ in systems where the
structural and magnetic phase transitions are separated. Detecting the presence
of nematic degrees of freedom in iron-based superconductors is a difficult
task, since it involves measuring higher order spin correlation functions. We
show that the nematic degrees of freedom manifest themselves in the
experimentally measurable Raman response function. We calculate the Raman
response function in tetragonal phase in the large $N$ limit by considering
Aslamazov-Larkin type of diagrams that contain a series of inserted fermionic
boxes that resemble the nematic coupling constant of the theory. These diagrams
effectively account for collisions between spin fluctuations. By summing an
infinite number of such higher order diagrams, we demonstrate that the
electronic Raman response function shows a clear maximum at the structural
phase transition in the $B_{1g}$ channel. Hence, the Raman response function
can be used to probe nematic degrees of freedom.

particular interest for the new generation of low frequency radiotelescopes.
The proposed solution formalizes the reconstruction problem as a convex
optimization problem with spatial and spectral regularizations. The efficiency
of this approach has been already proven for narrow-band image reconstruction
and the present contribution can be considered as its extension to the
multi-frequency case. Because the number of frequency bands multiplies the size

iterative large scale optimization algorithm. It is shown that the main
computational bottleneck of the approach, which lies in the resolution of a
linear system, can be efficiently overcome by a fully parallel implementation
w.r.t. the frequencies, where each processor reconstructs a narrow-band image.
All the other optimization steps are extremely fast. A parallel implementation

ruthenium-oxygen $d-p$ and oxygen-oxygen $p-p$ hopping elements, crystal-field
splittings and spin-orbit coupling. The intraorbital Coulomb repulsion and
Hund's exchange are defined not only at ruthenium but also at oxygen ions. Our
results demonstrate that the RuO$_4$ layer cannot be regarded to be a pure
ruthenium $t_{2g}$ system. We examine a different scenario in which ruthenium
$e_g$ orbitals are partly occupied and highlight the significance of oxygen

finding that the electron number in the $d-p$ states is significantly smaller.

  We show that if an edge is stable in the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation of

in the Delaunay triangulation of $P$ under any convex distance function that is
sufficiently close to the Euclidean norm, and vice-versa. In particular, a

the points move along algebraic trajectories of bounded degree, the KDS
processes nearly quadratic events during the motion, each of which can

bouncing models when the electromagnetic action is coupled non-minimally to a
scalar field that, say, drives the background evolution. For scale factors that
have the power law form at very early times and non-minimal couplings which are
simple powers of the scale factor, one can easily show that scale invariant
spectra for the magnetic field can arise before the bounce for certain values
of the indices involved. It will be interesting to examine if these power
spectra retain their shape after the bounce. However, analytical solutions for
the Fourier modes of the electromagnetic vector potential across the bounce are
difficult to obtain. In this work, with the help of a new time variable that we
introduce, which we refer to as the ${\rm e}$-${\cal N}$-fold, we investigate
these scenarios numerically. Imposing the initial conditions on the modes in
the contracting phase, we numerically evolve the modes across the bounce and
evaluate the spectra of the electric and magnetic fields at a suitable time
after the bounce. As one could have intuitively expected, though the complete
spectra depend on the details of the bounce, we find that, under the original
conditions, scale invariant spectra of the magnetic fields do arise for
wavenumbers much smaller than the scale associated with the bounce. We also
show that magnetic fields which correspond to observed strengths today can be
generated for specific values of the parameters. But, we find that, at the
bounce, the backreaction due to the electromagnetic modes that have been
generated can be significantly large calling into question the viability of the
model. We briefly discuss the implications of our results.

empirically that conventional niching and mating restriction techniques

complex phenomena in real world and to anticipate collective behaviors such as
information spreading and social trends. One specific case of study is
represented by the collective attention to the action of political parties. Not
surprisingly, researchers and stakeholders tried to correlate parties' presence
on social media with their performances in elections. Despite the many efforts,
results are still inconclusive since this kind of data is often very noisy and
significant signals could be covered by (largely unknown) statistical
fluctuations. In this paper we consider the number of tweets (tweet volume) of
a party as a proxy of collective attention to the party, identify the dynamics
of the volume, and show that this quantity has some information on the
elections outcome. We find that the distribution of the tweet volume for each
party follows a log-normal distribution with a positive autocorrelation of the
volume over short terms, which indicates the volume has large fluctuations of
the log-normal distribution yet with a short-term tendency. Furthermore, by
measuring the ratio of two consecutive daily tweet volumes, we find that the
evolution of the daily volume of a party can be described by means of a
geometric Brownian motion (i.e., the logarithm of the volume moves randomly
with a trend). Finally, we determine the optimal period of averaging tweet
volume for reducing fluctuations and extracting short-term tendencies. We
conclude that the tweet volume is a good indicator of parties' success in the
elections when considered over an optimal time window. Our study identifies the
statistical nature of collective attention to political issues and sheds light
on how to model the dynamics of collective attention in social media.

finding the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters in a mixture model

of multimodal likelihood functions, it can get trapped at a local maximum. This
problem often occurs when sub-optimal starting values are used to initialize
the algorithm. Bayesian initialization averaging (BIA) is proposed as an
ensemble method to generate high quality starting values for the EM algorithm.
Competing sets of trial starting values are combined as a weighted average,

also be extended to variational Bayes (VB) methods, a class of algorithm
similar to EM that is based on an approximation of the model posterior. The BIA

specifically of the (total) density and flow of vehicles, is developed for the
case of ""mixed"" traffic, i.e., traffic comprising both ordinary and connected
vehicles. The development relies on the following realistic assumptions: (i)
The density and flow of connected vehicles are known at the (local or central)
traffic monitoring and control unit on the basis of their regularly reported
positions, and (ii) the average speed of conventional vehicles is roughly equal
to the average speed of connected vehicles. Thus, complete traffic state
estimation (for arbitrarily selected segments in the network) may be achieved
by merely estimating the percentage of connected vehicles with respect to the
total number of vehicles. A model is derived, which describes the dynamics of
the percentage of connected vehicles, utilizing only well-known conservation
law equations that describe the dynamics of the density of connected vehicles
and of the total density of all vehicles. Based on this model, which is a
linear time-varying system, an estimation algorithm for the percentage of
connected vehicles is developed employing a Kalman filter. The estimation
methodology is validated through simulations using a second-order macroscopic
traffic flow model as ground truth for the traffic state. The approach calls
for a minimum of spot sensor-based total flow measurements {according to a

  the ionizing spectra of reionization-era galaxies","11 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stv1907",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present Keck/MOSFIRE observations of UV metal lines in four bright
gravitationally-lensed z~6-8 galaxies behind the cluster Abell 1703. The
spectrum of A1703-zd6, a highly-magnified star forming galaxy with a
Lyman-alpha redshift of z=7.045, reveals a confident detection of the nebular
CIV emission line (unresolved with FWHM < 125 km/s). UV metal lines are not
detected in the three other galaxies. At z~2-3, nebular CIV emission is
observed in just 1% of UV-selected galaxies. The presence of strong CIV
emission in one of the small sample of galaxies targeted in this paper may
indicate hard ionizing spectra are more common at z~7. The total estimated
equivalent width of the CIV doublet (38 A) and CIV/Lyman-alpha flux ratio (0.3)
are comparable to measurements of narrow-lined AGNs. Photoionization models
show that the nebular CIV line can also be reproduced by a young stellar
population, with very hot metal poor stars dominating the photon flux
responsible for triply ionizing carbon. Regardless of the origin of the CIV, we
show that the ionizing spectrum of A1703-zd6 is different from that of typical
galaxies at z~2, producing more H ionizing photons per unit 1500A luminosity
and a larger flux density at 30-50 eV. If such extreme radiation fields are
typical in UV-selected systems at z>7, it would indicate that reionization-era
galaxies are more efficient ionizing agents than previously thought.
Alternatively, we suggest that the small sample of Lyman-alpha emitters at z>7
may trace a rare population with intense radiation fields capable of ionizing
their surrounding hydrogen distribution. Additional constraints on high
ionization emission lines in galaxies with and without Lyman-alpha detections
will help clarify whether hard ionizing spectra are common in the reionization
era.

entropy-weak solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with
viscosities $\nu(\varrho)=\mu\varrho$ and $\lambda(\varrho)=0$ and a pressure
law under the form $p(\varrho)=a\varrho^\gamma$ with $a>0$ and $\gamma>1$

sense, results with constant viscosities initiated by E. Feiersl, B.J. Jin and
A. Novotny.
  We present some mathematical results related to the weak-strong uniqueness,
convergence to a dissipative solution of compressible or incompressible Euler
equations. As a by-product, this mathematically justifies the convergence of
solutions of a viscous shallow water system to solutions of the inviscid
shall-water system.

a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The SQUID is shunted
with a capacitor forming a nonlinear oscillator with resonance frequency in the
range of several GHz. The resonance frequency is varied by tuning the Josephson
inductance of the SQUID with on-chip flux lines. We report measurements of
decaying oscillations in the time domain following a brief excitation with a
microwave pulse. The nonlinearity of the SQUID oscillator is probed by
observing the ringdown response for different excitation amplitudes while the
SQUID potential is varied by adjusting the flux bias. Simulations are performed
on a model circuit by numerically solving the corresponding Langevin equations
incorporating the SQUID potential at the experimental temperature and using
parameters obtained from separate measurements characterizing the SQUID
oscillator. Simulations are in good agreement with the experimental
observations of the ringdowns as a function of applied magnetic flux and pulse
amplitude. We observe a crossover between the occurrence of ringdowns close to
resonance and adiabatic following at larger detuning from the resonance. We
also discuss the occurrence of phase jumps at large amplitude drive. Finally,
we briefly outline prospects for a readout scheme for superconducting flux
qubits based on the discrimination between ringdown signals for different
levels of magnetic flux coupled to the SQUID.

introduced separately for relativistic and non-relativistic particles, by way
of the parameters $G_{\rm matter}(k,z)$ and $G_{\rm light}(k,z)$ using two bins
in both scale and time, with transition wavenumber $0.01$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and
redshift 1. We emphasize the use of two dynamical probes to constrain this set
of parameters, galaxy power spectrum multipoles and the direct peculiar
velocity power spectrum, which probe fluctuations on different scales. The
multipole measurements are derived from the WiggleZ and BOSS Data Release 11
CMASS galaxy redshift surveys and the velocity power spectrum is measured from
the velocity sub-sample of the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey. We combine with
additional cosmological probes including baryon acoustic oscillations, Type Ia
SNe, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), lensing of the CMB, and the
temperature--galaxy cross-correlation. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
likelihood analysis, we find the inferred best-fit parameter values of $G_{\rm
matter}(k,z)$ and $G_{\rm light}(k,z)$ to be consistent with the standard model
at the $95\%$ confidence level. Furthermore, accounting for the
Alcock-Paczynski effect, we perform joint fits for the expansion history and
growth index gamma; we measure $\gamma = 0.665 \pm 0.0669$ ($68\%$ C.L) for a
fixed expansion history, and $\gamma = 0.73^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$ ($68\%$ C.L) when
the expansion history is allowed to deviate from $\Lambda$CDM. With a fixed
expansion history the inferred value is consistent with GR at the $95\%$ C.L;
alternatively, a $2\sigma$ tension is observed when the expansion history is
not fixed, this tension is worsened by the combination of growth and SNe data.

tool for observing the Sun at high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution.
These capabilities can address a broad range of fundamental scientific
questions in solar physics. The radiation observed by ALMA originates mostly
from the chromosphere - a complex and dynamic region between the photosphere
and corona, which plays a crucial role in the transport of energy and matter
and, ultimately, the heating of the outer layers of the solar atmosphere. Based
on first solar test observations, strategies for regular solar campaigns are
currently being developed. State-of-the-art numerical simulations of the solar
atmosphere and modeling of instrumental effects can help constrain and optimize
future observing modes for ALMA. Here we present a short technical description
of ALMA and an overview of past efforts and future possibilities for solar
observations at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths. In addition, selected
numerical simulations and observations at other wavelengths demonstrate ALMA's
scientific potential for studying the Sun for a large range of science cases.

malware grows in number and complexity, there have been recent efforts to
automate the detection mechanisms and many of the static tasks. As Android's
market share is rapidly growing around the world. Android security will be a
crucial area of research for IT security professionals and their academic
counterparts. The upside of the current situation is that malware is being
quickly exposed, thanks to open source software development tools. This
cooperation is important in curbing the widespread theft of personal

both classical and quantum-information technology. Unfortunately, nonlinear
interactions are usually feeble and therefore all-optical logic gates tend to
be inefficient. A quantum emitter deterministically coupled to a propagating
mode fundamentally changes the situation, since each photon inevitably
interacts with the emitter, and highly correlated many-photon states may be
created . Here we show that a single quantum dot in a photonic-crystal
waveguide can be utilized as a giant nonlinearity sensitive at the
single-photon level. The nonlinear response is revealed from the intensity and
quantum statistics of the scattered photons, and contains contributions from an
entangled photon-photon bound state. The quantum nonlinearity will find
immediate applications for deterministic Bell-state measurements and
single-photon transistors and paves the way to scalable waveguide-based

canonical dependent measures to study how the effects of a manipulation unfold
over time. Although this gives rise to the well-known multiple comparisons
problem, i.e. an inflated probability that the null hypothesis is incorrectly
rejected (Type I error), it is accepted standard practice not to apply any
correction procedures. Instead, there appears to be a widespread belief that
corrections are not necessary because the increase in false positives is too
small to matter. To our knowledge, no formal argument has ever been presented
to justify this assumption. Here, we report a computational investigation of
this issue using Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that, contrary to
conventional wisdom, false positives are increased to unacceptable levels when
no corrections are applied. Our simulations also show that counter-measures
like the Bonferroni correction keep false positives in check while reducing
statistical power only moderately. Hence, there is little reason why such
corrections should not be made a standard requirement. Further, we discuss
three statistical illusions that can arise when statistical power is low, and
we show how power can be improved to prevent these illusions. In sum, our work
renders a detailed picture of the various types of statistical errors than can
occur in studies of reading behavior and we provide concrete guidance about how
these errors can be avoided.

functional nanostructures. However, imaging them spatially in the gas phase has
been unsuccessful. It is found experimentally that if C60 is excited by an
800-nm laser, the photoelectron casts an anisotropic velocity image, but the
image becomes isotropic if excited at a 400-nm wavelength. This diffuse image
difference has been attributed to electron thermal ionization, but more recent
experiments (800 nm) reveal a clear non-diffuse image superimposed on the
diffuse image, whose origin remains a mystery. Here we show that the
non-diffuse anisotropic image is the precursor of the $f$ SAMO. We predict that
four 800-nm photons can directly access the $1f$ SAMO, and with one more
photon, can image the orbital, with the photoelectron angular distribution
having two maxima at 0$^\circ$ and 180$^\circ$ and two humps separated by
56.5$^\circ$. Since two 400-nm photons only resonantly excite the spherical
$1s$ SAMO and four 800-nm photon excite the anisotropic $1f$ SAMO, our finding
gives a natural explanation of the non-diffuse image difference, complementing
the thermal scenario.

distributions are usually more robust to random failures but less robust to
localized attacks. To better understand the effect of the broadness of the
degree distribution we study here two models where the broadness is controlled
and compare their robustness against localized attacks (LA) and random attacks
(RA). We study analytically and by numerical simulations the cases where the
degrees in the networks follow a Bi-Poisson distribution $P(k)=\alpha
e^{-\lambda_1}\frac{\lambda_1^k}{k!}+(1-\alpha)
e^{-\lambda_2}\frac{\lambda_2^k}{k!},\alpha\in[0,1]$, and a Gaussian
distribution $P(k)=A \cdot exp{(-\frac{(k-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}$ with a
normalization constant $A$ where $k\geq 0$. In the Bi-Poisson distribution the
broadness is controlled by the values of $\alpha$, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$,
while in the Gaussian distribution it is controlled by the standard deviation,
$\sigma$. We find that only for $\alpha=0$ or $\alpha=1$, namely degrees
obeying a pure Poisson distribution, LA and RA are the same but for all other
cases networks are more vulnerable under LA compared to RA. For Gaussian
distribution, with an average degree $\mu$ fixed, we find that when $\sigma^2$
is smaller than $\mu$ the network is more vulnerable against random attack.
However, when $\sigma^2$ is larger than $\mu$ the network becomes more
vulnerable against localized attack. Similar qualitative results are also shown
for interdependent networks.

the free energy of a spin glass in statistical physics, and we borrow

characterized by discontinuous jumps in the order parameter and normal

is maximal and the fluctuations range over the entire range of allowed values,
the behavior has been coined an `extreme Thouless effect'. Here, we report
findings of such a phenomenon, in the context of dynamic, social networks.
Defined by minimal rules of evolution, it describes a population of extreme
introverts and extroverts, who prefer to have contacts with, respectively, no
one or everyone. From the dynamics, we derive an exact distribution of
microstates in the stationary state. With only two control parameters,
$N_{I,E}$ (the number of each subgroup), we study collective variables of
interest, e.g., $X$, the total number of $I$-$E $ links and the degree
distributions. Using simulations and mean-field theory, we provide evidence
that this system displays an extreme Thouless effect. Specifically, the
fraction $X/\left( N_{I}N_{E}\right) $ jumps from $0$ to $1$ (in the
thermodynamic limit) when $N_{I}$ crosses $N_{E}$, while all values appear with
equal probability at $N_{I}=N_{E}$.

  A Comparison of Algorithms",,,,,"cs.AI cs.CL cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Social media is becoming an increasingly important source of information to
complement traditional pharmacovigilance methods. In order to identify signals
of potential adverse drug reactions, it is necessary to first identify medical
concepts in the social media text. Most of the existing studies use
dictionary-based methods which are not evaluated independently from the overall
signal detection task.
  We compare different approaches to automatically identify and normalise
medical concepts in consumer reviews in medical forums. Specifically, we
implement several dictionary-based methods popular in the relevant literature,
as well as a method we suggest based on a state-of-the-art machine learning
method for entity recognition. MetaMap, a popular biomedical concept extraction
tool, is used as a baseline. Our evaluations were performed in a controlled
setting on a common corpus which is a collection of medical forum posts
annotated with concepts and linked to controlled vocabularies such as MedDRA
and SNOMED CT.
  To our knowledge, our study is the first to systematically examine the effect
of popular concept extraction methods in the area of signal detection for
adverse reactions. We show that the choice of algorithm or controlled
vocabulary has a significant impact on concept extraction, which will impact
the overall signal detection process. We also show that our proposed machine
learning approach significantly outperforms all the other methods in
identification of both adverse reactions and drugs, even when trained with a
relatively small set of annotated text.

complicate the exploration and exploitation tradeoff because they introduce

difficult to obtain oracle solutions that assume known statistics of bandits.
To gain insight, we first study unit-cost systems with known context
distribution. When the expected rewards are known, we develop an approximation
of the oracle, referred to Adaptive-Linear-Programming (ALP), which achieves
near-optimality and only requires the ordering of expected rewards. With these
highly desirable features, we then combine ALP with the upper-confidence-bound
(UCB) method in the general case where the expected rewards are unknown {\it a
priori}. We show that the proposed UCB-ALP algorithm achieves logarithmic
regret except for certain boundary cases. Further, we design algorithms and
obtain similar regret analysis results for more general systems with unknown
context distribution and heterogeneous costs. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work that shows how to achieve logarithmic regret in
constrained contextual bandits. Moreover, this work also sheds light on the
study of computationally efficient algorithms for general constrained
contextual bandits.

  note: text overlap with arXiv:1501.04621",,,,"physics.med-ph q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Source localization in EEG represents a high dimensional inverse problem,
which is severely ill-posed by nature. Fortunately, sparsity constraints have
come into rescue as it helps solving the ill-posed problems when the signal is
sparse. When the signal has a structure such as block structure, consideration
of block sparsity produces better results. Knowing sparse Bayesian learning is
an important member in the family of sparse recovery, and a superior choice
when the projection matrix is highly coherent (which is typical the case for
EEG), in this work we evaluate the performance of block sparse Bayesian
learning (BSBL) method for EEG source localization. It is already accepted by
the EEG community that a group of dipoles rather than a single dipole are
activated during brain activities; thus, block structure is a reasonable choice
for EEG. In this work we use two definitions of blocks: Brodmann areas and
automated anatomical labelling (AAL), and analyze the reconstruction
performance of BSBL methodology for them. A realistic head model is used for
the experiment, which was obtained from segmentation of MRI images. When the
number of simultaneously active blocks is 2, the BSBL produces overall
localization accuracy of less than 5 mm without the presence of noise. The
presence of more than 3 simultaneously active blocks and noise significantly
affect the localization performance. Consideration of AAL based blocks results
more accurate source localization in comparison to Brodmann area based blocks.

designed material structures providing high local density of photonic states, a
phenomenon often referred to as the Purcell effect. Plasmonic nanorod
metamaterials with hyperbolic dispersion of electromagnetic modes are believed
to deliver a significant Purcell enhancement with both broadband and
non-resonant nature. Here, we have investigated finite-size cavities formed by
nanorod metamaterials and shown that the main mechanism of the Purcell effect
in these hyperbolic resonators originates from the cavity hyperbolic modes,
which in a microscopic description stem from the interacting cylindrical
surface plasmon modes of the finite number of nanorods forming the cavity. It
is found that emitters polarized perpendicular to the nanorods exhibit strong
decay rate enhancement, which is predominantly influenced by the rod length. We
demonstrate that this enhancement originates from Fabry-Perot modes of the
metamaterial cavity. The Purcell factors, delivered by those cavity modes,
reach several hundred, which is 4-5 times larger than those emerging at the
epsilon near zero transition frequencies. The effect of enhancement is less
pronounced for dipoles, polarized along the rods. Furthermore, it was shown
that the Purcell factor delivered by Fabry-Perot modes follows the dimension
parameters of the array, while the decay rate in the epsilon near-zero regime
is almost insensitive to geometry. The presented analysis shows a possibility
to engineer emitter properties in the structured metamaterials, addressing
their microscopic structure.

plasticity which accounts for the infinite and discrete symmetry group G of the

countably-many G-related wells in strain space, whereon the material evolves by
energy minimization under the loading through spontaneous slip processes
inducing the creation and motion of dislocations without the need of auxiliary
hypotheses. Multiple slips may be activated simultaneously, in domains
separated by a priori unknown free boundaries. The wells visited by the strain
at each position and time, are tracked by the evolution of a G-valued discrete
plastic map, whose non-compatible discontinuities identify lattice
dislocations. The main effects in the plasticity of crystalline materials at
microscopic scales emerge in this framework, including the long-range elastic
fields of possibly interacting dislocations, lattice friction, hardening,
band-like vs. complex spatial distributions of dislocations. The main results
concern the scale-free intermittency of the flow, with power-law exponents for
the slip avalanche statistics which are significantly affected by the symmetry

valuable datasets to study the dynamics of the Local Universe. However, such
catalogs suffer from biases whose effects increase with the distance. Malmquist
biases and lognormal error distribution affect the catalogs. Velocity fields of
the Local Universe reconstructed with these catalogs present a spurious overall
infall onto the Local Volume if they are not corrected for biases. Such an
infall is observed in the reconstructed velocity field obtained when applying
the BayesianWiener-Filter technique to the raw second radial peculiar velocity
catalog of the Cosmicflows project. In this paper, an iterative method to
reduce spurious non-Gaussianities in the radial peculiar velocity distribution,
to retroactively derive overall better distance estimates resulting in a
minimization of the effects of biases, is presented. This method is tested with
mock catalogs. To control the cosmic variance, mocks are built out of different
cosmological constrained simulations which resemble the Local Universe. To
realistically reproduce the effects of biases, the mocks are constructed to be
look-alikes of the second data release of the Cosmicflows project, with respect
to the size, distribution of data and distribution of errors. Using a suite of
mock catalogs, the outcome of the correction is verified to be affected neither
by the added error realization, nor by the datapoint selection, nor by the
constrained simulation. Results are similar for the different tested mocks.
After correction, the general infall is satisfactorily suppressed. The method
allows us to obtained catalogs which together with the Wiener-Filter technique
give reconstructions approximating non biased velocity fields at 100-150 km/s
(2-3 Mpc/h in terms of linear displacement), the linear theory threshold.

on the convergence S/N map of a 2.3 square degree field observed during the
early commissioning phase of the camera. Multi-color photometric data is used
to generate optically selected clusters using the CAMIRA algorithm. The optical
cluster positions were correlated with the peak positions from the convergence
map. All eight significant peaks have optical counterparts. The velocity
dispersion of clusters are evaluated by adopting the Singular Isothemal Sphere
(SIS) fit to the tangential shear profiles, yielding virial mass estimates,
M500c, of the clusters which range from 2.7x10^13 to 4.4x10^14 solar mass. The
number of peaks is considerably larger than the average number expected from
LambdaCDM cosmology but this is not extremely unlikely if one takes the large
sample variance in the small field into account. We could, however, safely
argue that the peak count strongly favours the recent Planck result suggesting
high sigma8$value of 0.83. The ratio of stellar mass to the dark matter halo
mass shows a clear decline as the halo mass increases. If the gas mass
fraction, fg, in halos is universal, as has been suggested in the literature,
the observed baryon mass in stars and gas shows a possible deficit compared
with the total baryon density estimated from the baryon oscillation peaks in
anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background.

multivariate data gave rise to new representation systems, specifically
designed for data with anisotropic features. Some prominent examples of these
are given by ridgelets, curvelets, and shearlets, to name a few.
  The great variety of such so-called directional systems motivated the search
for a common framework, which unites many under one roof and enables a
simultaneous analysis, for example with respect to approximation properties.
Building on the concept of parabolic molecules, the recently introduced
framework of $\alpha$-molecules does in fact include the previous mentioned
systems. Until now however it is confined to the bivariate setting, whereas
nowadays one often deals with higher dimensional data. This motivates the
extension of this unifying theory to dimensions larger than 2, put forward in
this work. In particular, we generalize the central result that the
cross-Gramian of any two systems of $\alpha$-molecules will to some extent be
localized.
  As an exemplary application, we investigate the sparse approximation of video
signals, which are instances of 3D data. The multivariate theory allows us to
derive almost optimal approximation rates for a large class of representation

12; and [c] the surrounding stellar cluster, Berkeley 90. Methods: Most of the
data used in this paper are multi-epoch high-S/N optical spectra though we also
use Lucky Imaging and archival photometry. The spectra are reduced with devoted
pipelines and processed with our own software, such as a spectroscopic-orbit
code, CHORIZOS, and MGB. Results: LS III +46 11 is identified as a new
very-early-O-type spectroscopic binary [O3.5 If* + O3.5 If*] and LS III +46 12
as another early O-type system [O4.5 V((f))]. We measure a 97.2-day period for

35.60$\pm$0.77 M_Sol for its two stars. We measure the extinction to both
stars, estimate the distance, search for optical companions, and study the
surrounding cluster. In doing so, a variable extinction is found as well as
discrepant results for the distance. We discuss possible explanations and
suggest that LS III +46 12 may be a hidden binary system, where the companion

rendered the preservation of privacy of individuals more and more difficult.
Most of the proposed approaches to preserve privacy in personalization systems
usually address this issue uniformly across users, thus ignoring the fact that
users have different privacy attitudes and expectations (even among their own
personal data). In this paper, we propose to account for this non-uniformity of
privacy expectations by introducing the concept of heterogeneous differential
privacy. This notion captures both the variation of privacy expectations among
users as well as across different pieces of information related to the same
user. We also describe an explicit mechanism achieving heterogeneous
differential privacy, which is a modification of the Laplacian mechanism by
Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, and Smith. In a nutshell, this mechanism achieves
heterogeneous differential privacy by manipulating the sensitivity of the
function using a linear transformation on the input domain. Finally, we
evaluate on real datasets the impact of the proposed mechanism with respect to
a semantic clustering task. The results of our experiments demonstrate that
heterogeneous differential privacy can account for different privacy attitudes
while sustaining a good level of utility as measured by the recall for the
semantic clustering task.

binary relations is often used as an alternative model. Selinger's CPM
construction provides the setting for mixed states in Hilbert space based
categorical quantum mechanics. By analogy, applying the CPM construction to Rel
is seen as introducing mixing into a relational setting. We investigate the
category CPM(Rel) of completely positive maps in Rel. We show that the states
of an object in CPM(Rel) are in bijective correspondence with certain families
of graphs. Via map-state duality this then allows us provide a graph theoretic
characterization of the morphisms in CPM(Rel). By identifying an appropriate
composition operation on graphs, we then show that CPM(Rel) is isomorphic to a
category of sets and graphs between them. This isomorphism then leads to a
graph based description of the complete join semilattice enriched dagger
compact structure of CPM(Rel). These results allow us to reason about CPM(Rel)
entirely in terms of graphs. We exploit these techniques in several examples.
We give a closed form expression for the number of states of a finite set in

demonstrate the possibly surprising phenomenon of a pure state that can be
given as a mixture of two mixed states.

repopulation following cell killing. No statistical evidence for a two-pathway

formation rate (SSFR) in nearby galaxies, cross-correlating two proxies of this
quantity -- the equivalent width of the \Ha\ line and the $(u-r)$ colour --
with other physical properties (mass, metallicity, environment, morphology, and
the presence of close companions) in a sample of $\sim82500$ galaxies extracted
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The existence of a relatively tight
`ageing sequence' in the colour-equivalent width plane favours a scenario where
the secular conversion of gas into stars (i.e. `nature') is the main physical
driver of the instantaneous SSFR and the gradual transition from a `chemically
primitive' (metal-poor and intensely star-forming) state to a `chemically
evolved' (metal-rich and passively evolving) system. Nevertheless,
environmental factors (i.e. `nurture') are also important. In the field,
galaxies may be temporarily affected by discrete `quenching' and `rejuvenation'
episodes, but such events show little statistical significance in a
probabilistic sense, and we find no evidence that galaxy interactions are, on
average, a dominant driver of star formation. Although visually classified
mergers tend to display systematically higher EW(H$\alpha$) and bluer $(u-r)$
colours for a given luminosity, most galaxies with high SSFR have uncertain
morphologies, which could be due to either internal or external processes.
Field galaxies of early and late morphological types are consistent with the
gradual `ageing' scenario, with no obvious signatures of a sudden decrease in
their SSFR. In contrast, star formation is significantly reduced and sometimes
completely quenched on a short time scale in dense environments, where many
objects are found on a `quenched sequence' in the colour-equivalent width
plane.

  Process (IJDKP), March 2015, Volume 5, Number 2",,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In todays world there is a wide availability of huge amount of data and thus
there is a need for turning this data into useful information which is referred
to as knowledge. This demand for knowledge discovery process has led to the
development of many algorithms used to determine the association rules. One of
the major problems faced by these algorithms is generation of candidate sets.
The FP Tree algorithm is one of the most preferred algorithms for association
rule mining because it gives association rules without generating candidate
sets. But in the process of doing so, it generates many CP trees which
decreases its efficiency. In this research paper, an improvised FP tree
algorithm with a modified header table, along with a spare table and the MFI
algorithm for association rule mining is proposed. This algorithm generates
frequent item sets without using candidate sets and CP trees.

randomized low-diameter decomposition. Loosely speaking, $\beta$-decomposition
refers to a probability distribution over partitions of the metric into sets of
low diameter, such that nearby points (parameterized by $\beta>0$) are likely
to be ""clustered"" together. Applying this notion to the shortest-path metric in
edge-weighted graphs, it is known that $n$-vertex graphs admit an $O(\ln
n)$-padded decomposition (Bartal, 1996), and that excluded-minor graphs admit
$O(1)$-padded decomposition (Klein, Plotkin and Rao 1993, Fakcharoenphol and
Talwar 2003, Abraham et al. 2014).
  We design decompositions to the family of $p$-path-separable graphs, which
was defined by Abraham and Gavoille (2006). and refers to graphs that admit
vertex-separators consisting of at most $p$ shortest paths in the graph.
  Our main result is that every $p$-path-separable $n$-vertex graph admits an
$O(\ln (p \ln n))$-decomposition, which refines the $O(\ln n)$ bound for
general graphs, and provides new bounds for families like bounded-treewidth
graphs. Technically, our clustering process differs from previous ones by
working in (the shortest-path metric of) carefully chosen subgraphs.

vision sensing is more critical for small aerial vehicles due to lack of high

of autonomy, these vehicles have been challenging platforms to implement vision

strict constraints drive the need for new vision processing architectures for
small unmanned aerial vehicles. Recent research has shown encouraging results

to understanding the operation of these devices is the exciton binding energy,
which has proved both difficult to measure directly and controversial. We
demonstrate that by using very high magnetic fields it is possible to make an
accurate and direct spectroscopic measurement of the exciton binding energy,
which we find to be only 16 meV at low temperatures, over three times smaller
than has been previously assumed. In the room temperature phase we show that
the binding energy falls to even smaller values of only a few
millielectronvolts, which explains their excellent device performance due to
spontaneous free carrier generation following light absorption. Additionally,
we determine the excitonic reduced effective mass to be 0.104me (where me is

experimentally but in good agreement with recent calculations. Our work
provides crucial information about the photophysics of these materials, which
will in turn allow improved optoelectronic device operation and better

Assuming that SNe Ia exactly trace the Hubble diagram of the Universe, we
re-investigate the Amati relation for low redshift ($z<1.4$) and high redshift

The systems are complemented by the Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions.
Under suitable assumptions on the coefficients of the reaction terms, these
problems possess both global solutions and solutions which blow up in finite
time. We show that any solution $(u,v)$ defined on the time interval $(0,T)$
satisfies a universal estimate of the form $$u(x,t)+v(x,t)\leq
C(1+t^{-1}+(T-t)^{-1}),$$ where $C$ does not depend on $x,t,u,v,T$. In
particular, this bound guarantees global existence and boundedness for
threshold solutions lying on the borderline between blow-up and global
existence. Moreover, this bound yields optimal blow-up rate estimates for
solutions which blow up in finite time. Our estimates are based on new
Liouville-type theorems for the corresponding scaling invariant parabolic
system and require an optimal restriction on the space dimension $n$: $n\leq5$.
As an application we also prove the existence of time-periodic positive

analyze the behavior of current sheets whose inverse aspect ratio scales with
the Lundquist number $S$ as $S^{-1/3}$. This scaling has been recently
recognized to yield the threshold separating fast, ideal reconnection, with an
evolution and growth which are independent of $S$ provided this is high enough,
as it should be natural having the ideal case as a limit for $S\to\infty$. Our
simulations confirm that the tearing instability growth rate can be as fast as
$\gamma\approx 0.6\,{\tau_A}^{-1}$, where $\tau_A$ is the ideal Alfv\'enic time
set by the macroscopic scales, for our least diffusive case with $S=10^7$. The
expected instability dispersion relation and eigenmodes are also retrieved in
the linear regime, for the values of $S$ explored here. Moreover, in the
nonlinear stage of the simulations we observe secondary events obeying the same
critical scaling with $S$, here calculated on the \emph{local}, much smaller
lengths, leading to increasingly faster reconnection. These findings strongly
support the idea that in a fully dynamic regime, as soon as current sheets
develop, thin and reach this critical threshold in their aspect ratio, the
tearing mode is able to trigger plasmoid formation and reconnection on the
local (ideal) Alfv\'enic timescales, as required to explain the explosive
flaring activity often observed in solar and astrophysical plasmas.

of programs in the context of SCOOP -- an elegant concurrency model, recently
formalized based on Rewriting Logic (RL) and Maude. SCOOP is implemented in
Eiffel and its applicability is demonstrated also from a practical perspective,
in the area of robotics programming. Our contribution consists in devising and
integrating an alias analyzer and a Coffman deadlock detector under the roof of
the same RL-based semantic framework of SCOOP. This enables using the Maude
rewriting engine and its LTL model-checker ""for free"", in order to perform the
analyses of interest. We discuss the limitations of our approach for
model-checking deadlocks and provide solutions to the state explosion problem.
The latter is mainly caused by the size of the SCOOP formalization which
incorporates all the aspects of a real concurrency model. On the aliasing side,
we propose an extension of a previously introduced alias calculus based on
program expressions, to the setting of unbounded program executions such as
infinite loops and recursive calls. Moreover, we devise a corresponding
executable specification easily implementable on top of the SCOOP
formalization. An important property of our extension is that, in
non-concurrent settings, the corresponding alias expressions can be
over-approximated in terms of a notion of regular expressions. This further
enables us to derive an algorithm that always stops and provides a sound
over-approximation of the ""may aliasing"" information, where soundness stands
for the lack of false negatives.

linearly dispersing fermions, whose spectrum we show to precisely match the
prediction by $so(N)_1$ conformal field theory. Furthermore, by an explicit
construction we show that all the cluster models are dual to non-locally
coupled transverse field Ising chains, with the universality of the $so(N)_1$
criticality manifesting itself as $N$ of these chains becoming critical. This
duality also reveals that the symmetry protection of cluster models arises from
the underlying Ising symmetries and it enables the identification of local
representations for the primary fields of the $so(N)_1$ conformal field
theories. For the simplest and experimentally most realistic case that
corresponds to the original one-dimensional cluster model with local three-spin

yet it is not specifically quantum. More specific to quantum mechanics is the
connection between entanglement and thermodynamics, which leads to an
identification between entropies and measures of pure state entanglement. Here
we search for the roots of this connection, investigating the relation between
entanglement and thermodynamics in the framework of general probabilistic
theories. We first address the question whether an entangled state can be
transformed into another by means of local operations and classical
communication. Under two operational requirements, we prove a general version
of the Lo-Popescu theorem, which lies at the foundations of the theory of
pure-state entanglement. We then consider a resource theory of purity where
free operations are random reversible transformations, modelling the scenario
where an agent has limited control over the dynamics of a closed system. Our
key result is a duality between the resource theory of entanglement and the
resource theory of purity, valid for every physical theory where all processes
arise from pure states and reversible interactions at the fundamental level. As
an application of the main result, we establish a one-to-one correspondence
between entropies and measures of pure bipartite entanglement and exploit it to
define entanglement measures in the general probabilistic framework. In
addition, we show a duality between the task of information erasure and the
task of entanglement generation, whereby the existence of entropy sinks
(systems that can absorb arbitrary amounts of information) becomes equivalent
to the existence of entanglement sources (correlated systems from which
arbitrary amounts of entanglement can be extracted).

Manual screening ensures the highest data quality. This catalogue is known as

identify the detections, a cross correlation with 228 catalogues is also

excellent resource in which to find new and extreme objects.

here $n$ is the number of nodes in the network and $D$ is its (hop) diameter.
This is the first non-trivial deterministic algorithm for this problem. It also
improves (i) the running time of the randomized $(1+o(1))$-approximation
$\tilde O(n^{1/2}D^{1/4}+D)$-time algorithm of Nanongkai [STOC 2014] by a
factor of as large as $n^{1/8}$, and (ii) the $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log

O(n^{1/2+\epsilon}+D)$-time algorithm [STOC 2013] within the same running time.
Our running time matches the known time lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1/2}/\log n +
D)$ [Elkin STOC 2004] up to subpolynomial factors, thus essentially settling
the status of this problem which was raised at least a decade ago [Elkin SIGACT
News 2004]. It also implies a $(2+o(1))$-approximation
$(n^{1/2+o(1)}+D^{1+o(1)})$-time algorithm for approximating a network's
weighted diameter which almost matches the lower bound by Holzer and Pinsker
[OPODIS 2015]. In achieving this result, we develop two techniques which might
be of independent interest and useful in other settings: (i) a deterministic
process that replaces the ""hitting set argument"" commonly used for shortest
paths computation in various settings, and (ii) a simple, deterministic,
construction of an $(n^{o(1)}, o(1))$-hop set of size $n^{1+o(1)}$. We combine
these techniques with many distributed algorithmic techniques, some of which
from problems that are not directly related to shortest paths, e.g., ruling
sets [Goldberg et al. STOC 1987], source detection [Lenzen and Peleg PODC
2013], and partial distance estimation [Lenzen and Patt-Shamir PODC 2015].

excludes the parameter region that can explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly at the
1$\sigma$ level. We then discuss the phenomenology of extra Higgs bosons and
the standard model-like Higgs boson ($h$) to probe the scenario favored by the
$g-2$ data at the collider experiments. We find that the $4\tau$, $3\tau$ and
$4\tau + W/Z$ signatures are expected as the main signal of the extra Higgs
bosons at the LHC. In addition, we clarify that the value of the $h\tau\tau$
coupling is predicted to be the standard model value times about $-1.6$ to
$-1.0$, and the branching fraction of the $h\to \gamma\gamma$ mode deviates
from the standard model prediction by $-30\%$ to $-15\%$. Furthermore, we find
that the exotic decay mode, $h$ decaying into the $Z$ boson and a light CP-odd
scalar boson, is allowed, and its branching fraction can be a few percent.
These deviations in the property of $h$ will be tested by the precision
measurements at future collider experiments.

quadruple system containing a contact binary with P~0.23 d and a detached
binary with P~1.31 d was announced in 2013. Subsequently Koo et al. confirmed
the detached binary spectroscopically and identified a fifth set of static
spectral lines at its location, corresponding to a further non-eclipsing
component of the system. Here we present new spectroscopic and photometric
observations, allowing confirmation of the contact binary and improved
modelling of all four eclipsing components. The detached binary is found to
contain components of masses 0.837(8) and 0.674(7) M_sol, with radii of
0.832(18) and 0.669(18) R_sol and effective temperatures of 5185(-20,+25) and

T_eff of 4700(50) K. The fifth star is of similar temperature and spectral type
to the primaries in the two binaries. Long-term photometric observations
indicate the presence of a spot on one component of the detached binary, moving
at an apparent rate of approximately one rotation every two years. Both
binaries have consistent system velocities around -11 to -12 km/s, which match
the average radial velocity of the fifth star, consistent distance estimates
for both subsystems of d=78(3) and d=73(4) pc are also found, and (with some
further assumptions) of d=83(9) pc for the fifth star. These findings strongly
support the claim that both binaries (and very probably all five stars) are
gravitationally bound in a single system. The consistent angles of inclination
found for the two binaries (88.2(3) and 86(4) degrees) may also indicate that
they originally formed by fragmentation (~9-10 Gyr ago) from a single
protostellar disk and subsequently remained in the same orbital plane.

that appears in many areas of Computer Science. It can be equivalently stated
as computing a homomorphism $\mbox{$\bR \rightarrow \bGamma$}$ between two
relational structures, e.g.\ between two directed graphs. Analyzing its
complexity has been a prominent research direction, especially for {\em fixed
template CSPs} in which the right side $\bGamma$ is fixed and the left side
$\bR$ is unconstrained.
  Far fewer results are known for the {\em hybrid} setting that restricts both
sides simultaneously. It assumes that $\bR$ belongs to a certain class of
relational structures (called a {\em structural restriction} in this paper). We
study which structural restrictions are {\em effective}, i.e.\ there exists a
fixed template $\bGamma$ (from a certain class of languages) for which the
problem is tractable when $\bR$ is restricted, and NP-hard otherwise. We
provide a characterization for structural restrictions that are {\em closed
under inverse homomorphisms}. The criterion is based on the {\em chromatic
number} of a relational structure defined in this paper; it generalizes the
standard chromatic number of a graph.
  As our main tool, we use the algebraic machinery developed for fixed template
CSPs. To apply it to our case, we introduce a new construction called a ""lifted
language."" We also give a characterization for structural restrictions
corresponding to minor-closed families of graphs, extend results to certain
Valued CSPs (namely conservative valued languages), and state implications for
CSPs with ordered variables, (valued) CSPs on structures with large girth, and
for the maximum weight independent set problem on some restricted families of
graphs including graphs with large girth.

colours of these objects and compare them to what is expected from different
combinations of AGN and galaxy templates. We find that, in general, the
host-galaxy emission gives an importan contribution to the observed mid-IR flux
in particular at the longest wavelengths (W3, at 12micron, and W4, at
22micron). In about half of the sources (22 objects) we observe a very red
mid-IR colour (W4-W3>2.5) that can be explained only using a starburst galaxy
template (M82). Using the 22micron luminosities, corrected for the AGN
contribution, we have then estimated the star-formation rate for 20 of these
""red"" RL NLS1, finding values ranging from 10 to 500 Msun/y. For the RL NLS1
showing bluer colours, instead, we cannot exclude the presence of a
star-forming host galaxy although, on average, we expect a lower star-formation
rate. Studying the radio (1.4GHz) to mid-IR (22micron) flux ratios of the RL
NLS1 in the sample we found that in ~10 objects the star-forming activity could
represent the most important component also at radio frequencies, in addition
(or in alternative) to the relativistic jet. We conclude that both the mid-IR
and the radio emission of RL NLS1 are a mixture of different components,
including the relativistic jet, the dusty torus and an intense star-forming
activity.

  Minor update: fixed typos, corrected comma placement",,,,"cs.DS cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During compilation of a program, register allocation is the task of mapping
program variables to machine registers. During register allocation, the
compiler may introduce shuffle code, consisting of copy and swap operations,
that transfers data between the registers. Three common sources of shuffle code
are conflicting register mappings at joins in the control flow of the program,
e.g, due to if-statements or loops; the calling convention for procedures,
which often dictates that input arguments or results must be placed in certain
registers; and machine instructions that only allow a subset of registers to
occur as operands. Recently, Mohr et al. proposed to speed up shuffle code with
special hardware instructions that arbitrarily permute the contents of up to
five registers and gave a heuristic for computing such shuffle codes. In this
paper, we give an efficient algorithm for generating optimal shuffle code in
the setting of Mohr et al. An interesting special case occurs when no register
has to be transferred to more than one destination, i.e., it suffices to
permute the contents of the registers. This case is equivalent to factoring a
permutation into a minimal product of permutations, each of which permutes up
to five elements.

$n$-dimensional hypercube. In 1997, Bollob\'as and Leader proved that there
must be $(n-k)2^k$ edge-disjoint paths between such $A$ and $B$. They
conjectured that when $A$ is a down-set and $B$ is an up-set, these paths may
be chosen to be directed (that is, the vertices in the path form a chain). We
use a novel type of compression argument to prove stronger versions of these
conjectures, namely that the largest number of edge-disjoint paths between a
down-set $A$ and an up-set $B$ is the same as the largest number of directed
edge-disjoint paths between $A$ and $B$. Bollob\'as and Leader made an
analogous conjecture for vertex-disjoint paths and we prove a strengthening of
this by similar methods. We also prove similar results for all other sizes of
$A$ and $B$.

The proposed approach has three major phases : Feature Extraction, Construction
of hybrid spectrum knowledge base and Classification. In the first phase,
feature extraction of the shape is done using pattern spectrum and local binary
pattern method. In the second phase, the histograms of both pattern spectrum
and local binary pattern are fused and stored in the knowledge base. In the
third phase, the comparison and matching of the features, which are represented
in the form of histograms, is done using Earth Movers Distance(EMD) as metric.
The top-n shapes are retrieved for each query shape. The accuracy is tested by
means of standard Bulls eye score method. The experiments are conducted on
publicly available shape datasets like Kimia-99, Kimia-216 and MPEG-7. The
comparative study is also provided with the well known approaches to exhibit
the retrieval accuracy of the proposed approach.

network according to their participation in shortest paths. Since an exact
computation is prohibitive in large networks, several approximation algorithms
have been proposed. Besides that, recent years have seen the publication of
dynamic algorithms for efficient recomputation of betweenness in evolving
networks. In previous work we proposed the first semi-dynamic algorithms that
recompute an approximation of betweenness in connected graphs after batches of
edge insertions.
  In this paper we propose the first fully-dynamic approximation algorithms
(for weighted and unweighted undirected graphs that need not to be connected)
with a provable guarantee on the maximum approximation error. The transfer to
fully-dynamic and disconnected graphs implies additional algorithmic problems
that could be of independent interest. In particular, we propose a new upper
bound on the vertex diameter for weighted undirected graphs. For both weighted
and unweighted graphs, we also propose the first fully-dynamic algorithms that
keep track of such upper bound. In addition, we extend our former algorithm for
semi-dynamic BFS to batches of both edge insertions and deletions.
  Using approximation, our algorithms are the first to make in-memory
computation of betweenness in fully-dynamic networks with millions of edges
feasible. Our experiments show that they can achieve substantial speedups

quantum gravity coupled to fermionic degrees of freedom. The theory is based on
a C*-algebra that involves holonomy-diffeomorphisms on a 3-dimensional manifold
and which encodes the canonical commutation relations of canonical quantum
gravity formulated in terms of Ashtekar variables. Employing a Dirac type
operator on the configuration space of Ashtekar connections we obtain a
semi-classical state and a kinematical Hilbert space via its GNS construction.
We use the Dirac type operator, which provides a metric structure over the
space of Ashtekar connections, to define a scalar curvature operator, from
which we obtain a candidate for a Hamilton operator. We show that the classical
Hamilton constraint of general relativity emerges from this in a semi-classical
limit and we then compute the operator constraint algebra. Also, we find states
in the kinematical Hilbert space on which the expectation value of the Dirac
type operator gives the Dirac Hamiltonian in a semi-classical limit and thus
provides a connection to fermionic quantum field theory. Finally, an

from their optical appearance. Extreme examples of stripped galaxies are the
so-called ``jellyfish galaxies'', that exhibit tentacles of debris material
with a characteristic jellyfish morphology. We have conducted the first
systematic search for galaxies that are being stripped of their gas at low-z
(z=0.04-0.07) in different environments, selecting galaxies with varying
degrees of morphological evidence for stripping. We have visually inspected B
and V-band images and identified 344 candidates in 71 galaxy clusters of the
OMEGAWINGS+WINGS sample and 75 candidates in groups and lower mass structures
in the PM2GC sample. We present the atlas of stripping candidates and a first
analysis of their environment and their basic properties, such as morphologies,
star formation rates and galaxy stellar masses. Candidates are found in all
clusters and at all clustercentric radii, and their number does not correlate
with the cluster velocity dispersion sigma or X-ray luminosity L_X.
Interestingly, convincing cases of candidates are also found in groups and
lower mass haloes (10^{11}-10^{14} M_{sun}), although the physical mechanism at
work needs to be securely identified. All the candidates are disky, have
stellar masses ranging from log M/M_{sun} < 9 to > 11.5 and the majority of
them form stars at a rate that is on average a factor of 2 higher (2.5 sigma)
compared to non-stripped galaxies of similar mass. The few post-starburst and
passive candidates have weak stripping evidence. We conclude that the stripping
phenomenon is ubiquitous in clusters and could be present even in groups and
low mass haloes. Further studies will reveal the physics of the gas stripping
and clarify the mechanisms at work.

asymptotics for sub-Riemannian Laplacians and to extend results that are
classical in the Riemannian case concerning Weyl measures, quantum limits,
quantum ergodicity, quasi-modes, trace formulae.Even if hypoelliptic operators
have been well studied from the point of view of PDEs, global geometrical and
dynamical aspects have not been the subject of much attention. As we will see,
already in the simplest case, the statements of the results in the
sub-Riemannian setting are quite different from those in the Riemannian one.
Let us consider a sub-Riemannian (sR) metric on a closed three-dimensional
manifold with an oriented contact distribution. There exists a privileged
choice of the contact form, with an associated Reeb vector field and a
canonical volume form that coincides with the Popp measure. We establish a
Quantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of any associated sR
Laplacian under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. The limit measure
is given by the normalized Popp measure.This is the first time that such a
result is established for a hypoelliptic operator, whereas the usual Shnirelman
theorem yields QE for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a closed Riemannian
manifold with ergodic geodesic flow.To prove our theorem, we first establish a
microlocal Weyl law, which allows us to identify the limit measure and to prove
the microlocal concentration of the eigenfunctions on the characteristic
manifold of the sR Laplacian. Then, we derive a Birkhoff normal form along this
characteristic manifold, thus showing that, in some sense, all 3D contact
structures are microlocally equivalent. The quantum version of this normal form
provides a useful microlocal factorization of the sR Laplacian. Using the
normal form, the factorization and the ergodicity assumption, we finally
establish a variance estimate, from which QE follows.We also obtain a second
result, which is valid without any ergodicity assumption: every Quantum Limit
(QL) can be decomposed in a sum of two mutually singular measures: the first
measure is supported on the unit cotangent bundle and is invariant under the sR
geodesic flow, and the second measure is supported on the characteristic
manifold of the sR Laplacian and is invariant under the lift of the Reeb flow.
Moreover, we prove that the first measure is zero for most QLs.

infinitely thin layer of dipoles oriented normally to the metal surface. The
nonlocal polarizability of the dipole layer is mapped from the free-electron
distribution near the metal surface as obtained with 1D quantum calculations,
such as time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), and is determined
once and for all. The model can be applied to any system size that is tractable
within classical electrodynamics, while capturing quantum plasmonic aspects of
nonlocal response and a finite work function with TDDFT-level accuracy.

excitation wavelength, in accordance with the surface plasmon resonance of the
gold nanoparticles, and also on the graphene-nanoparticle distance which is
tuned by annealing at moderate temperatures. The observed SERS activity is
correlated to the nanoscale corrugation of graphene. STM and STS measurements
show that the local density of electronic states in graphene is modulated by
the underlying gold nanoparticles.

consideration of locally favoured structures (LFS), which are geometric motifs
which minimise the local free energy. Geometric frustration proposes that a
transition to a crystalline state is frustrated because these LFS do not tile
space. However, this concept is based on icosahedra which are not always the
LFS for a given system. The LFS of the popular Kob-Andersen (KA) model
glassformer is the bicapped square antiprism, which does tile space. Such an
LFS-crystal is indeed realised in the $\mathrm{Al_{2}Cu}$ structure, which is
predicted to be a low energy state for the KA model with a 2:1 composition. We
therefore hypothesise that upon changing the composition in the KA model
towards 2:1, geometric frustration may be progressively relieved, leading to
larger and larger domains of LFS which would ultimately correspond to the
$\mathrm{Al_{2}Cu}$ crystal. Remarkably, rather than an increase, upon changing
composition we find a small decrease in the LFS population, and the system
remains impervious to nucleation of LFS crystals. We suggest that this may be
related to the composition of the LFS, as only a limited subset are compatible
with the crystal. We further demonstrate that the $\mathrm{Al_{2}Cu}$ crystal
will grow from a seed in the KA model with 2:1 composition and identify the
melting temperature to be 0.447(2).

possible if pairwise sequence dissimilarities can be converted to a set of
distances that are proportional to the true evolutionary distances. Susko et
al. (2004) reported some strikingly broad results about the forms of
inconsistency in tree estimation that can arise if corrected distances are not
proportional to the true distances. They showed that if the corrected distance
is a concave function of the true distance, then inconsistency due to long
branch attraction will occur. If these functions are convex, then two ""long
branch repulsion"" trees will be preferred over the true tree -- though these
two incorrect trees are expected to be tied as the preferred true. Here we
extend their results, and demonstrate the existence of a tree shape (which we
refer to as a ""twisted Farris-zone"" tree) for which a single incorrect tree
topology will be guaranteed to be preferred if the corrected distance function
is convex. We also report that the standard practice of treating gaps in
sequence alignments as missing data is sufficient to produce non-linear
corrected distance functions if the substitution process is not independent of
the insertion/deletion process. Taken together, these results imply
inconsistent tree inference under mild conditions. For example, if some
positions in a sequence are constrained to be free of substitutions and
insertion/deletion events while the remaining sites evolve with independent
substitutions and insertion/deletion events, then the distances obtained by
treating gaps as missing data can support an incorrect tree topology even given
an unlimited amount of data.

Agents are not allowed to overpass, i.e., when an agent collides with another
it instantly starts moving with the same speed in the opposite direction
(without exchanging any information with the other agent). However, at the end
of each round each agent has access to limited information regarding its

  We assume that $n$ mobile agents are initially located on a circle unit
circumference at arbitrary but distinct positions unknown to other agents. The
agents are equipped with unique identifiers from a fixed range. The {\em

solve the location discovery problem. Interestingly, this result corresponds to
a combinatorial symmetry breaking problem, which might be of independent

first collision with another agent in a round, we design an asymptotically

$\frac{\eta}{s}\geq \frac{\hbar}{4\pi k_{B}}$ for the ratio between the shear
viscosity and the entropy density, $s$. Using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
(DMFT) we calculate the shear viscosity and entropy density for a fermionic
fluid described by a single band Hubbard model at half filling. Our calculated
shear viscosity as a function of temperature is compared with experimental data
for liquid $^{3}$He. At low temperature the shear viscosity is found to be well
above the quantum limit and is proportional to the characteristic Fermi liquid
$1/T^{2}$ dependence, where $T$ is the temperature. With increasing temperature
and interaction strength $U$ there is significant deviation from the Fermi
liquid form. Also, the shear viscosity violates the quantum limit near the
crossover from coherent quasi-particle based transport to incoherent transport
(the bad metal regime). Finally, the ratio of the shear viscosity to the
entropy density is found to be comparable to the KSS bound for parameters
appropriate to liquid $^{3}$He. However, this bound is found to be strongly
violated in the bad metal regime for parameters appropriate to lattice
electronic systems such as organic charge transfer salts.

in su(2) sector at weak coupling and directly showed that, up to one loop, the
finite volume dependence has exactly the form proposed in [1]. Another side of
the conjecture suggests that computation of the symmetric structure constant is
equivalent to computing the corresponding set of infinite volume form factors,
which can be extracted as the coefficients of finite volume expansion. In this

the solar neighbourhood. Furthermore, we model the CO line emission in a

Delta-variance spectra for centroid velocity (CV) maps as well as for
integrated intensity and column density maps for various chemical components:
the total, H2 and 12CO number density and the integrated intensity of both the
12CO and 13CO (J = 1 -> 0) lines. The spectral slopes of the Delta-variance
computed on the CV maps for the total and H2 number density are significantly
steeper compared to the different CO tracers. We find slopes for the
linewidth-size relation ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 for the total and H2 density
models, while the slopes for the various CO tracers range from 0.2 to 0.4 and
underestimate the values for the total and H2 density by a factor of 1.5-3.0.
We demonstrate that optical depth effects can significantly alter the

analytically calculated the long-term orbital effects induced by the putative
harmonic variation of $G$ at hand finding non-zero rates of change for the
semimajor axis $a$, the eccentricity $e$ and the argument of pericenter
$\omega$ of a test particle. For the LAGEOS satellite, an orbital increase as
large as $3.9$ m yr$^{-1}$ is predicted, in contrast with the observed decay of
$-0.203\pm 0.035$ m yr$^{-1}$. An anomalous perihelion precession as large as
14 arcseconds per century is implied for Saturn, while latest observations
constrain it down to the $10^{-4}$ arcseconds per century level. The rejection
level provided by Mercury is of the same order of magnitude.

deblurring problems. In this paper, we investigate the modified linearized
Bregman algorithm (MLBA) used in image deblurring problems, with a proper
treatment of the boundary artifacts. We consider two standard approaches: the
imposition of boundary conditions and the use of the rectangular blurring
matrix. The fast convergence of the MLBA depends on a regularizing
preconditioner that could be computationally expensive and hence it is usually
chosen as a block circulant circulant block (BCCB) matrix, diagonalized by
discrete Fourier transform. We show that the standard approach based on the
BCCB preconditioner may provide low quality restored images and we propose
different preconditioning strategies, that improve the quality of the
restoration and save some computational cost at the same time. Motivated by a
recent nonstationary preconditioned iteration, we propose a new algorithm that
combines such method with the MLBA.We prove that it is a regularizing and
convergent method. A variant with a stationary preconditioner is also
considered. Finally, a large number of numerical experiments shows that our
methods provide accurate and fast restorations, when compared with the state of
the art.

energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions are calculated in the

stiffness by 3-dimensional Langevin Molecular Dynamics simulation. Hard
polymers have a very small bending, and thus, their end-to-end distance is more
than soft polymers. Quantum dot lasers can be established as colloidal
particles dipped in a liquid and grafted by polymer brushes to maintain the
solution. Here by a study on molecular structures of PS and PE, we show that
the principle reason lies on large phenyl groups around the backbone carbons of
PS, rather than a PE with Hydrogen atoms. Our results show that the mean radius
of PS random coil is more than PE which directly affects the quantum dot
maintenance. In addition, effect of temperature increase on the mean radius is
investigated. Our results show that by increasing temperature, both polymers
tend to lengthen, and at all temperatures a more radius is predicted for PS
rather than PE, but interestingly, with a difference in short and long chains.
We show that stiffness enhancement is not the same at short and long polymers
and the behavior is very different. Our results show a good consonance with
both experimental and theoretical studies.

Master Stability Function formalism, which can be used to assess the stability
of a synchronized state. This approach is independent from the particular
topologies that the network visits, and is not restricted to commuting

can be faster than, comparable to, or even secular with respect to the the
