neutral $V_\text{Br}$-Sr$_\text{La}$ complexes that can temporarily trap
electrons. As a result, Auger quenching of free carriers is reduced, allowing
for a more linear, albeit slower, scintillation light yield response.
Experimental Stokes shifts can be related to different
Ce$_\text{La}$-Sr$_\text{La}$-$V_\text{Br}$ triple complex configurations.
Co-doping with other alkaline as well as alkaline earth metals is considered as
well. Alkaline elements are found to have extremely small solubilities on the
order of 0.1 ppm and below at 1000 K. Among the alkaline earth metals the
lighter dopant atoms prefer interstitial-like positions and create strong
scattering centers, which has a detrimental impact on carrier mobilities. Only
the heavier alkaline earth elements combine matching ionic radii with
sufficiently high solubilities. This provides a rationale for the experimental
finding that improved scintillator performance is exclusively achieved using
Sr, Ca, or Ba. The present mechanism demonstrates that co-doping of wide gap
materials can provide an efficient means for managing charge carrier
populations under out-of-equilibrium conditions. In the present case dopants
are introduced that manipulate not only the concentrations but the electronic
properties of intrinsic defects without introducing additional gap levels. This
leads to the availability of shallow electron traps that can temporarily
localize charge carriers, effectively deactivating carrier-carrier

effects on the scale of nanometers. A key ingredient is Hill's subdivision
potential that accommodates the non-extensive energy of independent small
systems, similar to how Gibbs' chemical potential accommodates distinct
particles. Nanothermodynamics is essential for characterizing the thermal
equilibrium distribution of independently relaxing regions inside bulk samples,
as is found for the primary response of most materials using various
experimental techniques. The subdivision potential ensures strict adherence to
the laws of thermodynamics: total energy is conserved by including an
instantaneous contribution from the entropy of local configurations, and total
entropy remains maximized by coupling to a thermal bath. A unique feature of
nanothermodynamics is the completely-open nanocanonical ensemble. Another
feature is that particles within each region become statistically
indistinguishable, which avoids non-extensive entropy, and mimics
quantum-mechanical behavior. Applied to mean-field theory, nanothermodynamics
gives a heterogeneous distribution of regions that yields stretched-exponential
relaxation and super-Arrhenius activation. Applied to Monte Carlo simulations,
there is a nonlinear correction to Boltzmann's factor that improves agreement
between the Ising model and measured non-classical critical scaling in magnetic
materials. Nanothermodynamics also provides a fundamental mechanism for the 1/f

measures, this direct information does not extend more than a century and a
half into the recent past. The magnitude distributions (occurrence frequencies)
of solar events (flares/CMEs) typically decrease with the parameter measured or
inferred (peak flux, mass, energy etc. Flare radiation fluxes tend to follow a
power law slightly flatter than $S^{-2}$, where S represents a peak flux; solar
particle events (SPEs) follow a still flatter power law up to a limiting
magnitude, and then appear to roll over to a steeper distribution, which may
take an exponential form or follow a broken power law. This inference comes
from the terrestrial $^{14}$C record and from the depth dependence of various
radioisotope proxies in the lunar regolith and in meteorites. Recently major
new observational results have impacted our use of the relatively limited
historical record in new ways: the detection of actual events in the $^{14}$C

used to monitor neural coding efficiency, but neuronal computation broadly
conceived requires more refined and targeted information measures of
input-output joint processes. A first step towards that larger goal is to
develop information measures for individual output processes, including
information generation (entropy rate), stored information (statistical
complexity), predictable information (excess entropy), and active information
accumulation (bound information rate). We calculate these for spike trains
generated by a variety of noise-driven integrate-and-fire neurons as a function
of time resolution and for alternating renewal processes. We show that their
time-resolution dependence reveals coarse-grained structural properties of
interspike interval statistics; e.g., $\tau$-entropy rates that diverge less
quickly than the firing rate indicate interspike interval correlations. We also
find evidence that the excess entropy and regularized statistical complexity of
different types of integrate-and-fire neurons are universal in the
continuous-time limit in the sense that they do not depend on mechanism
details. This suggests a surprising simplicity in the spike trains generated by
these model neurons. Interestingly, neurons with gamma-distributed ISIs and
neurons whose spike trains are alternating renewal processes do not fall into
the same universality class. These results lead to two conclusions. First, the
dependence of information measures on time resolution reveals mechanistic
details about spike train generation. Second, information measures can be used

respects hard real-time constraints, then enriching it by tree buffers makes it
possible to provide error traces, which are essential for diagnosing defects.
We show that tree buffers are also useful in other application domains. For
example, they can be used to implement functionality of capturing groups in
regular expressions. We prove optimal asymptotic bounds for our data structure,
and validate them using empirical data from two sources: regular expression
searching through Wikipedia, and runtime verification of execution traces
obtained from the DaCapo test suite.

inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform models based on the effective-one-body
formalism and include subleading modes of radiation beyond the leading $(2,2)$
mode. The presence of subleading modes increases signal power for inclined
binaries and allows for improved accuracy and precision in measurements of the
masses as well as breaking of extrinsic parameter degeneracies. For low total
masses, $M_{\mathrm{obs}} \lesssim 50 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, the observed chirp
mass $\mathcal{M}_{\rm obs} = M_{\mathrm{obs}}\,\eta^{3/5}$ ($\eta$ being the
symmetric mass ratio) is better measured. In contrast, as increasing power
comes from merger and ringdown, we find that the total mass $M_{\mathrm{obs}}$
has better relative precision than $\mathcal{M}_{\rm obs}$. Indeed, at high
$M_{\mathrm{obs}}$ ($\geq 300 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), the signal resembles a
burst and the measurement thus extracts the dominant frequency of the signal
that depends on $M_{\mathrm{obs}}$. Depending on the binary's inclination, at
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $12$, uncertainties in $M_{\mathrm{obs}}$ can be
as large as $\sim 20 \mbox{--}25\%$ while uncertainties in $\mathcal{M}_{\rm
obs}$ are $\sim 50 \mbox{--}60\%$ in binaries with unequal masses (those
numbers become $\sim 17\%$ versus $\sim22\%$ in more symmetric binaries).
Although large, those uncertainties will establish the existence of IMBHs. Our
results show that gravitational-wave observations can offer a unique tool to
observe and understand the formation, evolution and demographics of IMBHs,
which are difficult to observe in the electromagnetic window. (abridged)

and Margulis ('98) resolving Sprind\v{z}uk's conjecture, as well as its
extension by Kleinbock, Lindenstrauss, and Weiss ('04), hereafter abbreviated
KLW. As applications we prove the extremality of all hyperbolic measures of
smooth dynamical systems with sufficiently large Hausdorff dimension, and of
the Patterson--Sullivan measures of all nonplanar geometrically finite groups.
The key technical idea, which has led to a plethora of new applications, is a
significant weakening of KLW's sufficient conditions for extremality.
  In Part I, we introduce and develop a systematic account of two classes of
measures, which we call $quasi$-$decaying$ and $weakly$ $quasi$-$decaying$. We
prove that weak quasi-decay implies strong extremality in the matrix
approximation framework (which has received much attention in recent years),
thus proving a conjecture of KLW. We also prove the ""inherited exponent of
irrationality"" version of this theorem, describing the relationship between the
Diophantine properties of certain subspaces of the space of matrices and
measures supported on these subspaces.
  In subsequent papers, we exhibit numerous examples of quasi-decaying
measures, in support of the thesis that ""almost any measure from dynamics
and/or fractal geometry is quasi-decaying"". In addition to the examples
described above, we also prove (for example) that Gibbs measures (including
conformal measures) of infinite iterated function systems are quasi-decaying,
even if the systems in question do not satisfy the open set condition. We also
discuss examples of non-extremal measures coming from dynamics, illustrating
where the theory must halt.

interlayer coupling strengths between the adjacent bilayers are measured
according to energy separations of two pronounced low-energy van Hove

range of values for the interlayer interaction in different twisted bilayers.
Below the VHSs, the observed Landau quantization in the twisted bilayers is
identical to that of massless Dirac fermions in graphene monolayer, which
allows us to measure the Fermi velocity directly. Our result indicates that the
Fermi velocity of the twisted bilayers depends remarkably on both the twisted
angles and the interlayer coupling strengths. This removes the discrepancy
about the Fermi velocity renormalization in the twisted bilayers and provides a
consistent interpretation of all current data.

in terms of the different orientations that a state-vector can take within the

generators of SU(N), particularly suitable to describe multipartite systems,
from the viewpoint of the sub-entities. We then use it to show that non-product
states admit a general description in which the sub-entities can always remain
in well-defined states, even when they are entangled. Therefore, the completed
version of quantum mechanics provided by the extended Bloch representation, in
which the density operators are also representative of pure states, allows to
solve not only the well-known measurement problem, but also the lesser-known
entanglement problem. This because we no longer need to give up the general
physical principle saying that a composite entity exists, and therefore is in a
pure state, if and only if its components also exist, and therefore are in
well-defined pure states.

structures. The analytical distinction between these dimensions of structure
provides us with richer models of scientific development. In this study, I
assume that (i) social structures organize expectations into belief structures
that can be attributed to individuals and communities; (ii) expectations are
specified in scholarly literature; and (iii) intellectually the sciences
(disciplines, specialties) tend to self-organize as systems of rationalized
expectations. Whereas social organizations remain localized, academic writings
can circulate, and expectations can be stabilized and globalized using
symbolically generalized codes of communication. The intellectual
restructuring, however, remains latent as a second-order dynamics that can be
accessed by participants only reflexively. Yet, the emerging ""horizons of
meaning"" provide feedback to the historically developing organizations by
constraining the possible future states as boundary conditions. I propose to
model these possible future states using incursive and hyper-incursive
equations from the computation of anticipatory systems. Simulations of these
equations enable us to visualize the couplings among the historical--i.e.,
recursive--progression of social structures along trajectories, the
evolutionary--i.e., hyper-incursive--development of systems of expectations at
the regime level, and the incursive instantiations of expectations in actions,
organizations, and texts.

the concept referring to the object. However, formal/symbolic logics typically
presume atomic entities upon which other expressions are built. Can we reflect
our intuition about the concept onto formal/symbolic logics at all? I assure
that we can, but the usual perspective about the atomicity needs inspected. In
this work, I present gradual logic which materialises the observation that we
cannot tell apart whether a so-regarded atomic entity is atomic or is just
atomic enough not to be considered non-atomic. The motivation is to capture
certain phenomena that naturally occur around concepts with attributes,

dominates the dielectric spectra, whereas from the capillary-condensed state up
to complete filling an additional, fast relaxation in the core of the channels
is found. The temperature-dependence of the static capacitance, representative
of the averaged, collective molecular orientational ordering, indicates a
continuous, paranematic-to-nematic (P-N) transition, in contrast to the
discontinuous bulk behaviour. It is well described by a Landau-de-Gennes free
energy model for a phase transition in cylindrical confinement. The large
tensile pressure of 10 MPa in the capillary-condensed state, resulting from the
Young-Laplace pressure at highly curved liquid menisci, quantitatively accounts
for a downward-shift of the P-N transition and an increased molecular mobility
in comparison to the unstretched liquid state of the complete filling. The
strengths of the slow and fast relaxations provide local information on the
orientational order: The thermotropic behaviour in the core region is
bulk-like, i.e. it is characterized by an abrupt onset of the nematic order at
the P-N transition. By contrast, the interface ordering exhibits a continuous
evolution at the P-N transition. Thus, the phase behaviour of the entirely

grown to the size comparable to the wavelengths, the dust grains are expected
to have a large scattering opacity and thus the continuum emission is expected
to be polarized due to self-scattering. We perform 3D radiative transfer
calculations to estimate the polarization degree for the protoplanetary disks
having radial Gaussian-like dust surface density distributions, which have been
recently discovered. The maximum grain size is set to be $100 {\rm~\mu m}$ and
the observing wavelength to be 870 ${\rm \mu m}$. We find that the polarization
degree is as high as 2.5 % with a subarcsec spatial resolution, which is likely
to be detected with near-future ALMA observations. The emission is polarized
due to scattering of anisotropic continuum emission. The map of the
polarization degree shows a double peaked distribution and the polarization
vectors are in the radial direction in the inner ring and in the azimuthal
direction in the outer ring. We also find the wavelength dependence of the
polarization degree: the polarization degree is the highest if dust grains have
a maximum size of $a_{\rm max}\sim\lambda/2\pi$, where $\lambda$ is the
observing wavelength. Hence, multi-wave and spatially resolved polarization
observations toward protoplanetary disks enable us to put a constraint on the
grain size. The constraint on the grain size from polarization observations is
independent of or may be even stronger than that from the opacity index.

variant of distributional communication complexity where Alice gets some

distribution, and Bob wishes to compute some function $g(x,y)$ (with high
probability over $(x,y)$). In our variant, Alice does not know $g$, but only
knows some function $f$ which is an approximation of $g$. Thus, the function
being computed forms the context for the communication, and knowing it
imperfectly models (mild) uncertainty in this context.
  A naive solution would be for Alice and Bob to first agree on some common
function $h$ that is close to both $f$ and $g$ and then use a protocol for $h$
to compute $h(x,y)$. We show that any such agreement leads to a large overhead
in communication ruling out such a universal solution.

complexity $k$ in the standard setting, then it has a communication protocol
with complexity $O(k \cdot (1+I))$ in the uncertain setting, where $I$ denotes
the mutual information between $x$ and $y$. In the particular case where the
input distribution is a product distribution, the protocol in the uncertain
setting only incurs a constant factor blow-up in communication and error.
  Furthermore, we show that the dependence on the mutual information $I$ is
required. Namely, we construct a class of functions along with a non-product
distribution over $(x,y)$ for which the communication complexity is a single
bit in the standard setting but at least $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ bits in the

potential in achieving this goal, current attempts generally fail to learn
isomorphic hash codes in a seamless scheme, that is, they embed multiple
modalities in a continuous isomorphic space and separately threshold embeddings
into binary codes, which incurs substantial loss of retrieval accuracy. In this
paper, we approach seamless multimodal hashing by proposing a novel Composite
Correlation Quantization (CCQ) model. Specifically, CCQ jointly finds
correlation-maximal mappings that transform different modalities into
isomorphic latent space, and learns composite quantizers that convert the
isomorphic latent features into compact binary codes. An optimization framework
is devised to preserve both intra-modal similarity and inter-modal correlation
through minimizing both reconstruction and quantization errors, which can be
trained from both paired and partially paired data in linear time. A
comprehensive set of experiments clearly show the superior effectiveness and
efficiency of CCQ against the state of the art hashing methods for both
unimodal and cross-modal retrieval.

$V$. A set $S\subset V$ is said to be a simultaneous strong metric generator
for ${\cal G}$ if it is a strong metric generator for every graph of the
family. The minimum cardinality among all simultaneous strong metric generators
for ${\cal G}$, denoted by $Sd_s({\cal G})$, is called the simultaneous strong
metric dimension of ${\cal G}$. We obtain general results on $Sd_s({\cal G})$
for arbitrary families of graphs, with special emphasis on the case of families
composed by a graph and its complement. In particular, it is shown that the
problem of finding the simultaneous strong metric dimension of families of
graphs is $NP$-hard, even when restricted to families of trees.

companions in these so-called transitional disks. The goal of this work is to
use spectra of the transitional disk object LkCa 15 obtained with X-Shooter on
the Very Large Telescope to investigate the possibility of using
spectro-astrometry to detect planetary companions to T Tauri stars. It is
argued that an accreting planet should contribute to the total emission of
accretion tracers such as H$\alpha$ and therefore planetary companions could be
detected with spectro-astrometry in the same way as it has been used to detect
stellar companions to young stars. A probable planetary-mass companion was
recently detected in the disk of LkCa 15. Therefore, it is an ideal target for
this pilot study. We studied several key accretion lines in the wavelength
range 300 nm to 2.2 $\mu$m with spectro-astrometry. While no
spectro-astrometric signal is measured for any emission lines the accuracy
achieved in the technique is used to place an upper limit on the contribution
of the planet to the flux of the H$\alpha$, Pa$\gamma$, and Pa$\beta$ lines.
The derived upper limits on the flux allows an upper limit of the mass
accretion rate, log($\dot{M}_{acc}$) = -8.9 to -9.3 for the mass of the
companion between 6 M$_{Jup}$ and 15 M$_{Jup}$, respectively, to be estimated
(with some assumptions).

formed in situations of extreme gravitational collapse. This would allow a
radical resolution of the firewall paradox by allowing quantum effects to
significantly modify the spacetime geometry around a collapsed object. A string
bremsstrahlung process would convert the kinetic energy of infalling matter in
extreme gravitational collapse to form a region of the deformed vacuum, which
would be equivalent to forming a high temperature string phase. This process

tightly wound transient spirals, for a tepid Toomre-stable tapered disc. The
relative effect of the bulge, the halo, the disc temperature and the spectral
properties of the shot noise are investigated in turn. For such galactic discs
all elements seem to impact the locus and direction of the ridge. For instance,
when the halo mass is decreased, we observe a transition between a regime of
heating in the inner regions of the disc through the inner Lindblad resonance
to a regime of radial migration of quasi-circular orbits via the corotation
resonance in the outer part of the disc. The dressed secular formalism captures
both the nature of collisionless systems (via their natural frequencies and

power spectrum. Hence it provides the ideal framework in which to study their

produced by electrons accelerated at the external forward shock, and show that
the X-ray and the GeV fluxes lead to very different estimates of the initial
kinetic energy of the blast wave. The energy estimated from GeV is on average
$\sim50$ times larger than the one estimated from X-rays. We model the data

unveil the reason for this discrepancy and find that good modelling within the

the X-ray emitting electrons (unlike the GeV emitting electrons) are in the
slow cooling regime or ii) the X-ray synchrotron flux is strongly suppressed by
Compton cooling, whereas, due to the Klein-Nishina suppression, this effect is
much smaller at GeV energies. In both cases the X-ray flux is no longer a
robust proxy for the blast wave kinetic energy. On average, both cases require
weak magnetic fields ($10^{-6}\lesssim \epsilon_B \lesssim 10^{-3}$) and
relatively large isotropic kinetic blast wave energies

present the formalism that enables one to compute the diffusion tensor from a
given source of noise in the gravitational field when the system's dynamical
response to that noise is included. In the case of a cool stellar disc we are
able to reduce the computation of the diffusion tensor to a one-dimensional
integral. We implement this formula for a tapered Mestel disc that is exposed
to shot noise and find that we are able to explain analytically the principal
features of a numerical simulation of such a disc. In particular the formation
of narrow ridges of enhanced density in action space is recovered. As the
disc's value of Toomre's $Q$ is reduced and the disc becomes more responsive,
there is a transition from a regime of heating in the inner regions of the disc
through the inner Lindblad resonance to one of radial migration of
near-circular orbits via the corotation resonance in the intermediate regions
of the disc. The formalism developed here provides the ideal framework in which

  We show that both Reynolds and particle stress dominated flows fall into the
Bagnoldian inertial regime and that the Bagnold number can predict the bulk
behavior although this is due to two distinct physical mechanisms. A turbulent
flow is characterized by larger particle dispersion and a more uniform particle
distribution, whereas the particulate-dominated flows is associated with a
significant particle migration towards the channel center where the flow is
smooth laminar-like and dispersion low.Interestingly, the collision kernel
shows similar values in the different regimes, although the relative particle

$\mathbb{Q}$ and its Jacobian variety $J_0(3p)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Let
$\mathcal{T}(3p)$ and $\mathcal{C}(3p)$ be the group of rational torsion points
on $J_0(3p)$ and the cuspidal group of $J_0(3p)$, respectively. We prove that
the $3$-primary subgroups of $\mathcal{T}(3p)$ and $\mathcal{C}(3p)$ coincide
unless $p\equiv 1 \pmod 9$ and $3^{\frac{p-1}{3}} \equiv 1 \!\pmod {p}$.

by Kofler and Brukner to investigate temporal entanglement between binary human
behavioral unconscious choices at t1 with binary random outcomes at t2. NSIT
consists of a set of inequalities and represents mathematical conditions for
macro-realism which require only two measurements in time. The analyses of
three independent experiments show a strong violation of NSIT in two out of
three of them, supporting the hypothesis of a quantum-like temporal
entanglement between human choices at t1 with binary random outcomes at t2

dense nuclear matter are under discussion in comparison with their terrestrial
counterparts, e.g. so-called ""plasma"" PT in shock-compressed hydrogen, nitrogen
etc. Both, GLPT and QHPT, when being represented in widely accepted temperature
- baryonic chemical potential plane, are often considered as similar, i.e.
amenable to one-to-one mapping by simple scaling. It is argued that this
impression is illusive and that GLPT and QHPT belong to different classes: GLPT
is typical enthalpic PT (Van-der-Waals-like) while QHPT
(""deconfinement-driven"") is typical entropic PT. Subdivision of 1st-order
fluid-fluid phase transitions into enthalpy- and entropy-driven subclasses was
proposed previously [arXiv:1403.8053]. Properties of enthalpic and entropic PTs
differ significantly. Entropic PTs are always internal parts of more general
and extended thermodynamic anomalies - domains with abnormal (negative) sign
for the set of (usually positive) second derivatives of thermodynamic
potential. Three of them are of primary importance: Gruneizen and thermal
expansion and thermal pressure coefficients. Negative sign of these derivatives
lead to violation of standard behavior and relative order in P-V plane for many
iso-lines, e.g. isotherms, isentropes, shock adiabats etc. Entropic PTs have
more complicated topology of stable and metastable areas within its two-phase
region in comparison with conventional enthalpic (VdW-like) PTs. In particular,
new additional metastable region, bounded by new additional spinodal, appears
in the case of entropic PT. All the features of entropic PTs and accompanying
abnormal thermodynamics region have transparent geometrical interpretation -
multi-layered structure of thermodynamic surfaces for temperature, entropy and
internal energy as a pressure-volume functions, e.g. T(P,V), S(P,V) and U(P,V).

Natural transform are not known nor used. In the present paper, we are
concerned with definitions and investigations of the q-theory of the Natural
transform and some applications. We present two types of q-analogues of the
cited transform on given sets and get results of the nominated analogues for
certain class of functions of special type. We declare here that given results
are new and they complement recent known results related to q-Laplace and
q-Sumudu transforms. Over and above, we present some supporting examples to
illustrate effectiveness of the given results .
