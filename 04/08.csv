six dimensions. In particular we focus on the anomaly which arises in a
holographic calculation of Henningson and Skenderis. The various presentations
of the anomaly differ by some total derivative terms. We calculate the
corresponding Wald entropy for surfaces which do not have an Abelian $O(2)$
symmetry in the transverse direction although the extrinsic curvature vanishes.
We demonstrate that for this class of surfaces the Wald entropy is different
for different forms of the conformal anomaly. The difference is due to the
total derivative terms which are present in the anomaly. We analyze the
conformal invariance of the Wald entropy for the holographic conformal anomaly
and demonstrate that the violation of the invariance is due to the
contributions of the total derivative terms in the anomaly. Finally, we make
more precise general form of the Hung-Myers-Smolkin discrepancy.

momentum, $p_{T}$ from 1-3 GeV/c, in excess of the $p$$+$$p$ spectra scaled by
the nuclear overlap factor, $T_{AA}$. These low $p_{T}$ photons have a large
azimuthal anisotropy, $v_{2}$. Theoretical models, including hydrodynamic
models, struggle to quantitatively reproduce the large low $p_{T}$ direct
photon excess and $v_{2}$ in a self-consistent manner. This paper presents a
description of the low $p_{T}$ photon flow as the result of increased photon
production from soft-gluon mediated $q$-$\bar{q}$ interactions as the system
becomes color-neutral. This production mechanism will generate photons that
follow constituent quark number, $n_{q}$, scaling of $v_{2}$ with an $n_{q}$
value of two for direct photons. $\chi^{2}$ comparisons of the published PHENIX
direct photon and identified particle $v_{2}$ measurements finds that
$n_{q}$-scaling applied to the direct photon $v_{2}$ data prefers the value
$n_{q}=1.8$ and agrees with $n_{q}=2$ within errors in most cases. The 0-20%
and 20-40% Au$+$Au direct photon data are compared to a coalescence-like Monte
Carlo simulation that calculates the direct photon $v_{2}$ while describing the
shape of the direct photon $p_{T}$ spectra in a consistent manner. The
simulation, while systematically low compared to the data, is in agreement with
the Au$+$Au measurement at $p_{T}<3$ GeV/c in both centrality bins.
Furthermore, this model predicts that higher order flow harmonics, $v_{n}$, in
direct photons will follow the modified $n_{q}$-scaling laws seen in identified
hadron $v_{n}$ with an $n_{q}$ value of two.

due to their superior performance, increasing density, and lower power
consumption. Unfortunately, flash memory is subject to challenging
idiosyncrasies like erase-before-write and limited block lifetime. These
constraints are handled by a flash translation layer (FTL), which performs
out-of-place updates, wear-leveling and garbage-collection behind the scene,
while offering the application a virtualization of the physical address space.
  A class of relevant FTLs employ a flash-resident page-associative mapping
table from logical to physical addresses, with a smaller RAM-resident cache for
frequently mapped entries. In this paper, we address the problem of performing
garbage-collection under such FTLs. We observe two problems. Firstly,
maintaining the metadata needed to perform garbage-collection under these
schemes is problematic, because at write-time we do not necessarily know the
physical address of the before-image. Secondly, the size of this metadata must
remain small, because it makes RAM unavailable for caching frequently accessed
entries. We propose two complementary techniques, called Lazy Gecko and
Logarithmic Gecko, which address these issues. Lazy Gecko works well when RAM
is plentiful enough to store the GC metadata. Logarithmic Gecko works well when
RAM isn't plentiful and efficiently stores the GC metadata in flash. Thus,
these techniques are applicable to a wide range of flash devices with varying
amounts of embedded RAM.

efficiently we need to know where the largest, most easily detected moons can
form. We explore the possibility of large exomoons by following the movement of
water (H2O) ice lines in the accretion disks around young super-Jovian planets.
We want to know how different heating sources in those disks affect the H2O ice
lines. We simulate 2D rotationally symmetric accretion disks in hydrostatic
equilibrium around super-Jovian exoplanets. The energy terms in our
semi-analytical model -- (1) viscous heating, (2) planetary illumination, (3)
accretional heating, and (4) stellar illumination -- are fed by precomputed
planet evolution tracks. We consider planets accreting 1 to 12 Jupiter masses
at distances between 1 and 20 AU to a Sun-like star. Accretion disks around
Jupiter-mass planets closer than ~4.5 AU to Sun-like stars do not feature H2O
ice lines, but the most massive super-Jovians can form icy satellites as close
as ~3 AU to Sun-like stars. Super-Jovian planets forming beyond ~5 AU can host
Mars-mass moons. We study a broad range of disk parameters for planets at 5.2
AU and find that the H2O ice lines are universally between ~15 and 30 Jupiter
radii when the last generation of moons is forming. If the abundant population
of super-Jovian planets at ~1 AU formed in situ, then they should lack giant
icy moons because their disks did not host H2O ice in the final stages of
accretion. In the more likely case that these planets migrated to their current
locations from beyond a few AU, they might be orbited by large, H2O-rich moons.
In this case, Mars-mass ocean moons might be common in the stellar habitable
zones. Future exomoon searches can provide powerful constraints on the
formation and migration history of giant exoplanets.

data are needed to enhance the picture of structure evolution in this region
and to test state-of-the-art nuclear models. In a simple model, the maximum
collectivity is expected at the middle of the major shell. However, for actual
nuclei, this picture may no longer be the case, and one should use a more
realistic nuclear-structure model. We address this point by studying the
spectroscopy of Hf. We remeasure the 2^+_1 half-lives of 172,174,176Hf, for
which there is some disagreement in the literature. The main goal is to
measure, for the first time, the half-lives of higher-lying states of the
rotational band. The new results are compared to a theoretical calculation for
absolute transition strengths. The half-lives were measured using \gamma-\gamma
and conversion-electron-\gamma delayed coincidences with the fast timing
method. For the determination of half-lives in the picosecond region, the
generalized centroid difference method was applied. For the theoretical
calculation of the spectroscopic properties, the interacting boson model is
employed, whose Hamiltonian is determined based on microscopic energy-density
functional calculations. The measured 2^+_1 half-lives disagree with results
from earlier \gamma-\gamma fast timing measurements, but are in agreement with
data from Coulomb excitation experiments and other methods. Half-lives of the
4^+_1 and 6^+_1 states were measured, as well as a lower limit for the 8^+_1
states. We show the importance of the mass-dependence of effective boson charge
in the description of E2 transition rates in chains of nuclei. It encourages
further studies of the microscopic origin of this mass dependence. New data on
transition rates in nuclei from neighboring isotopic chains could support these
studies.

observed {\it in situ} in the Jupiter family comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by
the ROSINA mass spectrometer aboard the Rosetta spacecraft, assuming that this
body has been agglomerated from clathrates in the protosolar nebula.
Simulations are done using an elaborated interatomic potentials for
investigating the temperature dependence of the trapping within a multiple
guest clathrate formed from a gas mixture of CO and N$_2$ in proportions
corresponding to those expected for the protosolar nebula. By assuming that
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko agglomerated from clathrates, our calculations
suggest the cometary grains must have been formed at temperatures ranging
between $\sim$31.8 and 69.9 K in the protosolar nebula to match the N$_2$/CO
ratio measured by the ROSINA mass spectrometer. The presence of clathrates in
Jupiter family comets could then explain the potential N$_2$ depletion (factor
up to $\sim$87 compared to the protosolar value) measured in
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

energy radiation from a young star, may evaporate a significant fraction of a
planet's mass. If the momentum flux from the evaporative wind is not aligned
with the planet/star axis, then it can exert a torque on the planet's orbit.
Using steady-state one-dimensional evaporative wind models we estimate this
torque using a lag angle that depends on the product of the speed of the
planet's upper atmosphere and a flow timescale for the wind to reach its sonic
radius. We also estimate the momentum flux from time-dependent one-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations. We find that only in a very narrow regime in planet
radius, mass and stellar radiation flux is a wind capable of exerting a
significant torque on the planet's orbit. Similar to the Yarkovsky effect, the
wind causes the planet to drift outward if atmospheric circulation is prograde
(super-rotating) and in the opposite direction if the circulation is
retrograde. A close-in super Earth mass planet that loses a large fraction of
its mass in a wind could drift a few percent of its semi-major axis. While this
change is small, it places constraints on the evolution of resonant pairs such
as Kepler 36 b and c.

that the average size of an $(s,t)$-core, when $s$ and $t$ are coprime positive
integers, is $\frac1{24}(s-1)(t-1)(s+t-1)$. Armstrong also conjectured that the
same formula gives the average size of a self-conjugate $(s,t)$-core; this was
proved by Chen, Huang and Wang.
  In the present paper, we develop the ideas from the author's paper [J.
Combin. Theory Ser. A 118 (2011) 1525-1539] studying actions of affine
symmetric groups on the set of $s$-cores in order to give variants of
Armstrong's conjectures in which each $(s,t)$-core is weighted by the
reciprocal of the order of its stabiliser under a certain group action.
Informally, this weighted average gives the expected size of the $t$-core of a
random $s$-core.

systematic and practical. It is based on the electroweak chiral Lagrangian,
including a light Higgs boson, as the effective field theory (EFT) at the
electroweak scale $v$. This is the appropriate framework for the case of
sizeable deviations in the Higgs couplings of order $10\%$ from the Standard
Model, considered to be parametrically larger than new-physics effects in the
sector of electroweak gauge interactions. The role of power counting in
identifying the relevant parameters is emphasized. The three relevant scales,
$v$, the scale of new Higgs dynamics $f$, and the cut-off $\Lambda=4\pi f$,
admit expansions in $\xi=v^2/f^2$ and $f^2/\Lambda^2$. The former corresponds
to an organization of operators by their canonical dimension, the latter by
their loop order or chiral dimension. In full generality the EFT is thus
organized as a double expansion. However, as long as $\xi\gg 1/16\pi^2$ the EFT
systematics is closer to the chiral counting. The leading effects in the
consistent approximation provided by the EFT, relevant for the presently most
important processes of Higgs production and decay, are given by a few
(typically six) couplings. These parameters allow us to describe the properties
of the Higgs boson in a general and systematic way, and with a precision
adequate for the measurements to be performed at the LHC. The framework can be
systematically extended to include loop corrections and higher-order terms in
the EFT.

of the host galaxy and the wide polar structure in A0136-0801. The host galaxy
dominates the light emission in all bands; the polar structure is more luminous
in the optical bands and is three times more extended than the main spheroid.
The average stellar population in the spheroid is redder than in the polar
structure and we use their (B-K) vs. (J-K) colors to constraint the ages of
these populations using stellar population synthesis models. The inferred ages
are 3-5 Gyrs for the spheroid and 1-3 Gyrs for the polar structure. We then use
long slit spectra along the major axis of the polar structure to derive the
emission line ratios and constrain the oxygen abundance, metallicity and star
formation rate in this component. We find 12+log(O/H) = 8.33 +- 0.43 and Z ~
0.32 Zsun, using emission line ratios. These values are used, together with the
ratio of the baryonic masses of the host galaxy and polar structure, to
constraint the possible models for the formation scenario. We conclude that the
tidal accretion of gas from a gas rich donor or the disruption of a gas-rich
satellite are formation mechanisms that may lead to systems with physical
parameters in agreement with those measured for A0136-0801.

Each of these analyses possesses a common temporal symmetry which we exploit
here to fold the whole dataset for every detector pair, typically a few hundred
to a thousand days of data, to only one sidereal day, without any compromise in
precision. We develop the algebra and a software pipeline needed to fold data,
accounting for the effect of overlapping windows and non-stationary noise. We
implement this on LIGO's fifth science run data and validate it by performing a
standard anisotropic SGWB search on both folded and unfolded data. Folded data
not only leads to orders of magnitude reduction in computation cost, but it
results in a conveniently small data volume of few gigabytes, making it
possible to perform an actual analysis on a personal computer, as well as easy
movement of data. A few important analyses, yet unaccomplished due to
computational limitations, will now become feasible. Folded data, being
independent of the radiometer basis, will also be useful in reducing processing
redundancies in multiple searches and provide a common ground for mutual
consistency checks. Most importantly, folded data will allow vast amount of
experimentation with existing searches and provide substantial help in
developing new strategies to find unknown sources.

use the enormous volume factor that inflation yields as an appropriate measure,

(~5deg$^2$) Ly$\alpha$ survey at z=6.6 (Matthee et al. 2015) show that this is
not the case for the most luminous emitters. Here we present follow-up
observations of the two most luminous z~6.6 Ly$\alpha$ candidates in the COSMOS
field: `MASOSA' and `CR7'. We used X-SHOOTER, SINFONI and FORS2 (VLT), and
DEIMOS (Keck), to confirm both candidates beyond any doubt. We find redshifts
of z=6.541 and z=6.604 for MASOSA and CR7, respectively. MASOSA has a strong
detection in Ly$\alpha$ with a line width of $386\pm30$ km/s (FWHM) and with
high EW$_0$ (>200 \AA), but it is undetected in the continuum. CR7, with an
observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $10^{43.93\pm0.05}$erg/s is the most luminous
Ly$\alpha$ emitter ever found at z>6. CR7 reveals a narrow Ly$\alpha$ line with
$266\pm15$ km/s FWHM, being detected in the NIR (rest-frame UV, with
$\beta=-2.3\pm0.1$) with an excess in $J$, and also strongly detected in
IRAC/Spitzer. We detect a narrow HeII1640$\AA$ emission line ($6\sigma$) which
explains the excess seen in the $J$ band photometry (EW$_0$~80 \AA). We find no
other emission lines from the UV to the NIR in our X-SHOOTER spectra
(HeII/OIII]1663A>3 and HeII/CIII]1908A>2.5). We find that CR7 is best explained
by a combination of a PopIII-like population which dominates the rest-frame UV
and the nebular emission, and a more normal stellar population which dominates
the mass. HST/WFC3 observations show that the light is indeed spatially
separated between a very blue component, coincident with Ly$\alpha$ and HeII
emission, and two red components (~5 kpc away), which dominate the mass. Our
findings are consistent with theoretical predictions of a PopIII wave, with
PopIII star formation migrating away from the original sites of star formation.

populations are crucial to much of astrophysics. We analyse the evolution of
stellar mass functions of coeval main sequence stars including all relevant
aspects of single- and binary-star evolution. We show that the slope of the
upper part of the mass function in a stellar cluster can be quite different to
the slope of the initial mass function. Wind mass loss from massive stars leads
to an accumulation of stars which is visible as a peak at the high mass end of
mass functions, thereby flattening the mass function slope. Mass accretion and
mergers in close binary systems create a tail of rejuvenated binary products.
These blue straggler stars extend the single star mass function by up to a
factor of two in mass and can appear up to ten times younger than their parent
stellar cluster. Cluster ages derived from their most massive stars that are
close to the turn-off may thus be significantly biased. To overcome such
difficulties, we propose the use of the binary tail of stellar mass functions
as an unambiguous clock to derive the cluster age because the location of the
onset of the binary tail identifies the cluster turn-off mass. It is indicated
by a pronounced jump in the mass function of old stellar populations and by the
wind mass loss peak in young stellar populations. We further characterise the
binary induced blue straggler population in star clusters in terms of their
frequency, binary fraction and apparent age.

clusters well separated in metallicity. Abundances at first dredge-up are
satisfactorily reproduced but there is preliminary evidence to suggest that the
models overestimate the luminosity at which the surface composition first
changes in the lowest-metallicity system. Our models also begin extra mixing at
luminosities that are too high, demonstrating a significant discrepancy with
observations at low metallicity. We model the abundance changes during extra
mixing as a thermohaline process and determine that the usual diffusive form of
this mechanism cannot simultaneously reproduce both the carbon and lithium
observations. Hubble Space Telescope photometry provides turnoff and bump
magnitudes in a large number of globular clusters and offers the opportunity to
better test stellar modelling as function of metallicity. We directly compare
the predicted main-sequence turn-off and bump magnitudes as well as the
distance-independent parameter $\Delta M_V ~^{\rm{MSTO}}_{\rm{bump}}$. We
require 15 Gyr isochrones to match the main-sequence turn-off magnitude in some
clusters and cannot match the bump in low-metallicity systems. Changes to the
distance modulus, metallicity scale and bolometric corrections may impact on
the direct comparisons but $\Delta M_V ~^{\rm{MSTO}}_{\rm{bump}}$, which is
also underestimated from the models, can only be improved through changes to
the input physics. Overshooting at the base of the convective envelope with an

kinematically forbidden, stoponium bound states will form in $pp$ collisions
and subsequently decay via the pair annihilation of the constituent stops to
diboson final states, yielding striking resonance signatures. Remarkably, we
find that stoponium searches are highly complementary to direct collider
searches and indirect probes of light stops such as Higgs coupling
measurements. Using an empirical quarkonia potential model and including the
first two $S$-wave stoponium states, we find that in the decoupling limit
$m_{\widetilde t_1} \lesssim 130$ GeV is excluded for any value of the stop
mixing angle and heavy stop mass by the combination of the latest resonance
searches and the indirect constraints. The $\gamma \gamma$ searches are the
most complementary to the indirect constraints, probing the stop ""blind spot""
parameter region in which the $h^0 \tilde t_1 \tilde t_1^*$ trilinear coupling
is small. Interestingly, we also find that the $Z\gamma$ searches give a
stronger constraint, $m_{\widetilde t_1} \lesssim 170$ GeV, if the stop is
primarily left-handed. For a scenario with a bino LSP and stop NLSP, several
gaps in the direct collider searches for stops can unambiguously be filled with
the next run of the LHC. For a stop LSP decaying through an R-parity violating

Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) overlap regions. Individual SDSS imaging runs have
some overlap with each other, leading to repeat observations over an area
spanning >4000 deg^2 (more than 1/4 of the total footprint). These overlap
regions provide a unique dataset that allows us to select high-redshift quasars
more than 0.5 mag fainter in the z band than those found with the SDSS
single-epoch data. Our quasar candidates were first selected as i-band dropout
objects in the SDSS imaging database. We then carried out a series of follow-up
observations in the optical and near-IR to improve photometry, remove
contaminants, and identify quasars. The eight quasars reported here were
discovered in a pilot study utilizing the overlap regions at high galactic
latitude (|b|>30 deg). These quasars span a redshift range of 5.86<z<6.06 and a
flux range of 19.3<z_AB<20.6 mag. Five of them are fainter than z_AB=20 mag,
the typical magnitude limit of z~6 quasars used for the SDSS single-epoch
images. In addition, we recover eight previously known quasars at z~6 that are
located in the overlap regions. These results validate our procedure for
selecting quasar candidates from the overlap regions and confirming them with
follow-up observations, and provide guidance to a future systematic survey over
all SDSS imaging regions with repeat observations.

sought those GCs with exceptionally blue UV-to-optical colors, because
helium-enriched sub-populations produce a horizontal-branch morphology that is
well populated at high effective temperature. For comparison, integrated,
synthetic UV$-$optical and purely optical colors and magnitudes have been
constructed for 45 Galactic GCs, starting from individual-star photometry
obtained with the same instruments and the same filters. We identify a small
group of M 87 clusters exhibiting a radial UV$-$optical color gradient,

redder GCs is more spherical. We release to the astronomical community our

separated from antiferromagnetic order at TN = 110 K. Substitution of 5d
element, Ir, for Ru enhances spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and locking between the

intensifies the distortion or rotation of Ru/IrO6 octahedra and induces weak
ferromagnetic behavior along the c-axis. Moreover, the magnetic ordering
temperature TN increases from 110 K at x = 0 to 215 K with enhanced magnetic

and deviation) measured at rest-frame $B$-band (corresponding to HST/WFC3 F125W

M_{\odot}$) galaxy morphologies. Principal component analysis (PCA) quantifies
the correlations between these morphological indicators and determines the
relative importance of each. The first three principal components (PCs) capture
$\sim$75 per cent of the variance inherent to our sample. We interpret the
first principal component (PC) as bulge strength, the second PC as dominated by
concentration and the third PC as dominated by asymmetry. Both PC1 and PC2
correlate with the visual appearance of a central bulge and predict galaxy
quiescence. PC1 is a better predictor of quenching than stellar mass, as as
good as other structural indicators (S\'ersic-n or compactness). We divide the
PCA results into groups using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method.
Unlike S\'ersic, this classification scheme separates compact galaxies from
larger, smooth proto-elliptical systems, and star-forming disk-dominated clumpy
galaxies from star-forming bulge-dominated asymmetric galaxies. Distinguishing
between these galaxy structural types in a quantitative manner is an important

were limited in their ability to measure the diversity of information. We
address this problem by learning the topics of interest to social media users

probabilistic model that incorporates human cognitive constraints in a
generative model of information sharing. We then use the topics learned by the
model to measure the diversity of information users receive from their social
media contacts. We confirm that users in structurally diverse network
positions, which bridge otherwise disconnected regions of the follower graph,
are exposed to more diverse information. In addition, we identify user effort
as an important variable that mediates access to diverse information in social
media. Users who invest more effort into their activity on the site not only
place themselves in more structurally diverse positions within the network than
the less engaged users, but they also receive more diverse information when
located in similar network positions. These findings indicate that the
relationship between network structure and access to information in networks is

astrophysical objects. However, it can also be generated by electromagnetic

characterized and quantify the effect of electromagnetic frame-dragging in this

one of the two scalar fields being canonical. By appropriately choosing the
non-canonical scalar field, we show that the canonical scalar field corresponds
to a potential that is nearly the $R^2$ inflation potential. If the Type IV
singularity occurs at the end of inflation, the Universe's dynamical evolution
near inflation is determined effectively by the canonical scalar field and at
late-time the evolution is effectively determined by the non-canonical scalar.

emission is offset from the peak of the continuum emission in both nuclei by
about 100 pc in the same direction. CO self-absorption is detected at the
centers of both nuclei but it is much deeper in the eastern nucleus. We also
clearly detect strong, highly redshifted CO absorption located near the

line profile features with a simple kinematic model of a highly turbulent,
rotating disk with a substantial line center optical depth and a large gradient

too much bigger than the radial limit set, for the following dichotomy:
$\Lambda$ is either a real-analytic manifold or a fractal in the sense of
Mandelbrot (i.e. its Hausdorff dimension is strictly greater than its
topological dimension).
  Our primary focus is on the infinite-dimensional case. An important component
of the strategy of our proof comes from the rectifiability techniques of Mayer
and Urba\'nski ('03), who obtained a dimension rigidity result for conformal
iterated function systems (including those with infinite alphabets). In order
to handle the infinite dimensional case, both for Kleinian groups and for
iterated function systems, we introduce the notion of pseudorectifiability, a
variant of rectifiability, and develop a theory around this notion similar to
the theory of rectifiable sets.
  Our approach also extends existing results in the finite-dimensional case,
where it unifies the realms of Kleinian groups, conformal iterated function
systems, and rational functions. For Kleinian groups, we improve on the
rigidity result of Kapovich ('09) by substantially weakening its hypothesis of
geometrical finiteness. Moreover, our proof, based on rectifiability, is
entirely different than that of Kapovich, which depends on homological algebra.
  Another advantage of our approach is that it allows us to use the ""demension""
of \v{S}tan$'$ko ('69) as a substitute for topological dimension. For example,
we prove that any dynamically defined version of Antoine's necklace must have
Hausdorff dimension strictly greater than 1 (i.e. the demension of Antoine's

pursuit of personalized services based on a fine-grained behavioral analysis,
care must be taken to address user privacy concerns. In this paper, we consider
the use of web traces with truncated URLs - each URL is trimmed to only contain
the web domain - for this purpose. While such truncation removes the
fine-grained sensitive information, it also strips the data of many features
that are crucial to the profiling of user activity. We show how to overcome the
severe handicap of lack of crucial features for the purpose of filtering out
the URLs representing a user activity from the noisy network traffic trace

activity profiling with truncated URLs enables the network operators to provide
personalized services while mitigating privacy concerns by storing and sharing
only truncated traffic traces.
  In order to offset the accuracy loss due to truncation, our statistical
methodology leverages specialized features extracted from a group of
consecutive URLs that represent a micro user action like web click, chat reply,
etc., which we call bursts. These bursts, in turn, are detected by a novel
algorithm which is based on our observed characteristics of the inter-arrival

Unfortunately, the operators derived only apply to paths in 2D and require that
any intermediate waypoints we might want agents to follow be preassigned to
specific agents, limiting their range of applicability. In this paper we
resolve these limitations. We introduce new operators to deal with agents
moving in arbitrary dimensions that are faster to compute than their 2D
predecessors and we introduce landmarks, space-time positions that are
automatically assigned to the set of agents under different optimality
criteria. Finally, we report the performance of the new operators in several

$\overline{\Delta}(X)$ of $X$ to be the minimal infinite cardinal $\kappa$ such
that $X$ has a regular $G_\kappa$-diagonal i.e. there is a family
$(U_\eta:\eta<\kappa)$ of open neighborhoods of $\Delta_X=\{(x,x)\in X^2:x\in
X\}$ in $X^2$ such that $\Delta_X = \bigcap_{\eta<\kappa} \overline{U}_\eta$.
  In this paper we show that if $X$ is a Urysohn space then: (1) $|X|\leq
2^{c(X)\cdot\overline{\Delta}(X)}$; (2) $|X|\leq 2^{\overline{\Delta}(X)\cdot
2^{wL(X)}}$; (3) $|X|\le wL(X)^{\overline{\Delta}(X)\cdot\chi(X)}$; and (4)

$aL(X)$ are respectively the character, the cellularity, the weak Lindel\""of

  The first inequality extends to the uncountable case Buzyakova's result that
the cardinality of a ccc-space with a regular $G_\delta$-diagonal does not
exceed $2^\omega$. It follows from (2) that every weakly Lindel\""of space with
a regular $G_\delta$-diagonal has cardinality at most $2^{2^\omega}$.
  Inequality (3) implies that when $X$ is a space with a regular
$G_\delta$-diagonal then $|X|\le wL(X)^{\chi(X)}$. This improves significantly
Bell, Ginsburg and Woods inequality $|X|\le 2^{\chi(X)wL(X)}$ for the class of
normal spaces with regular $G_\delta$-diagonals. In particular (3) shows that
the cardinality of every first countable space with a regular
$G_\delta$-diagonal does not exceed $wL(X)^\omega$.
  For the class of spaces with regular $G_\delta$-diagonals (4) improves Bella
and Cammaroto inequality $|X|\le 2^{\chi(X)\cdot aL(X)}$, which is valid for
all Urysohn spaces. Also, it follows from (4) that the cardinality of every

non-Hausdorff} if for every non-empty finite subset $F$ of $A$ and every family
$\{U_x:x\in F\}$ of open neighborhoods $U_x$ of $x\in F$, $\cap\{U_x:x\in
F\}\ne\emptyset$ and \emph{the non-Hausdorff number $nh(X)$ of $X$} is defined
as follows: $nh(X):=1+\sup\{|A|:A\subset X$ is finitely non-Hausdorff$\}$.
Clearly, if $X$ is a Hausdorff space then $nh(X)=2$.
  We define the \emph{non-Urysohn number of $X$ with respect to the
singletons}, $nu_s(X)$, as follows:
$nu_s(X):=1+\sup\{\mathrm{cl}_\theta(\{x\}):x\in X\}$.
  In 1967 Hajnal and Juh\'asz proved that if $X$ is a Hausdorff space then: (1)
$|X|\le 2^{c(X)\chi(X)}$; and (2) $|X|\le 2^{2^{s(X)}}$; where $c(X)$ is the
cellularity, $\chi(X)$ is the character and $s(X)$ is the spread of $X$.
  In this paper we generalize (1) by showing that if $X$ is a topological space
then $|X|\le nh(X)^{c(X)\chi(X)}$. Immediate corollary of this result is that
(1) holds true for every space $X$ for which $nh(X)\le 2^\omega$ (and even for
spaces with $nh(X)\le 2^{c(X)\chi(X)}$). This gives an affirmative answer to a
question posed by M. Bonanzinga in 2013. A simple example of a $T_1$, first
countable, ccc-space $X$ is given such that $|X|>2^\omega$ and
$|X|=nh(X)^\omega=nh(X)$. This example shows that the upper bound in our
inequality is exact and that $nh(X)$ cannot be omitted (in particular, $nh(X)$
cannot always be replaced by $2$ even for $T_1$-spaces).
  In this paper we also generalize (2) by showing that if $X$ is a $T_1$-space
then $|X|\le 2^{nu_s(X)\cdot 2^{s(X)}}$. It follows from our result that (2) is
true for every $T_1$-space for which $nu_s(X)\le 2^{s(X)}$. A simple example
shows that the presence of the cardinal function $nu_s(X)$ in our inequality is
essential.

high quality (signal-to-noise ratio $\sim$ 75-90), medium-resolution spectra
for red giant branch stars in NGC 5053. Using these spectra we have measured
the Fe, Ca, Ti, Ni, Ba, Na, and O abundances in the cluster. We measure an
average cluster [Fe/H] abundance of -2.45 with a standard deviation of 0.04
dex, making NGC 5053 one of the most metal-poor GCs in the Milky Way (MW). The
[Ca/Fe], [Ti/Fe], and [Ba/Fe] we measure are consistent with the abundances of
MW halo stars at a similar metallicity, with alpha-enhanced ratios and slightly
depleted [Ba/Fe]. The Na and O abundances show the Na-O anti-correlation found
in most GCs. From our abundance analysis it appears that NGC 5053 is at least
chemically similar to other GCs found in the MW. This does not, however, rule
out NGC 5053 being associated with the Sgr dSph stream.

molecular turnover, how can synapses maintain strong for the years that
memories can persist? Some models postulate that biochemical bistability
maintains strong synapses. However, bistability should give a bimodal
distribution of synaptic strength or weight, whereas current data show unimodal
distributions for weights and for a correlated variable, dendritic spine
volume. Bistability of single synapses has also never been empirically
demonstrated. Thus it is important for models to simulate both unimodal
distributions and long-term memory persistence. Here a model is developed that
connects ongoing, competing processes of synaptic growth and weakening to
stochastic processes of receptor insertion and removal in dendritic spines. The
model simulates long-term (in excess of 1 yr) persistence of groups of strong
synapses. A unimodal weight distribution results. For stability of this
distribution it proved essential to incorporate resource competition between
synapses organized into small clusters. With competition, these clusters are
stable for years. These simulations concur with recent data to support the
clustered plasticity hypothesis, which suggests clusters, rather than single
synaptic contacts, may be a fundamental unit for storage of long-term memory.
The model makes empirical predictions, and may provide a framework to
investigate mechanisms maintaining the balance between synaptic plasticity and
stability of memory.

computational power. However, data transfer speeds have failed to keep pace and
are the major limiting factor in the development of exascale computing. New
algorithms must be developed which minimise the transfer of data. Patch
dynamics is a computational macroscale modelling scheme which provides a coarse
macroscale solution of a problem defined on a fine microscale by dividing the
domain into many nonoverlapping, coupled patches. Patch dynamics is readily
adaptable to massive parallelisation as each processor can evaluate the
dynamics on one, or a few, patches. However, patch coupling conditions
interpolate across the unevaluated parts of the domain between patches, and are
typically reevaluated at every microscale time step, thus requiring almost
continuous data transfer. We propose a modified patch dynamics scheme which
minimises data transfer by only reevaluating the patch coupling conditions at
`mesoscale' time scales which are significantly larger than the microscale time
of the microscale problem. We analyse the error arising from patch dynamics
with mesoscale temporal coupling as a function of the mesoscale time interval,
patch size, and ratio between the microscale and macroscale.

can be used to explore the properties of high-redshift universe. It is believed
that the long GRBs are associated with the deaths of massive stars. So it is
possible to use GRBs to investigate the star formation rate (SFR). In this
paper, we use Lynden-Bell's $c^-$ method to study the luminosity function and
rate of \emph{Swift} long GRBs without any assumptions. We find that the
luminosity of GRBs evolves with redshift as $L(z)\propto g(z)=(1+z)^k$ with
$k=2.43_{-0.38}^{+0.41}$. After correcting the redshift evolution through
$L_0(z)=L(z)/g(z)$, the luminosity function can be expressed as
$\psi(L_0)\propto L_0^{-0.14\pm0.02}$ for dim GRBs and $\psi(L_0)\propto
L_0^{-0.70\pm0.03}$ for bright GRBs, with the break point
$L_{0}^{b}=1.43\times10^{51}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$. We also find that the formation
rate of GRBs is almost constant at $z<1.0$ for the first time, which is
remarkably different from the SFR. At $z>1.0$, the formation rate of GRB is
consistent with the SFR. Our results are dramatically different from previous
studies. Some possible reasons for this low-redshift excess are discussed. We
also test the robustness of our results with Monte Carlo simulations. The
distributions of mock data (i.e., luminosity-redshift distribution, luminosity
function, cumulative distribution and $\log N-\log S$ distribution) are in good
agreement with the observations. Besides, we also find that there are
remarkable difference between the mock data and the observations if long GRB
are unbiased tracers of SFR at $z<1.0$.

in recent years due to progress in high-throughput sequencing technologies.
Novel sequence insertions, insertions without similarity to a human reference
genome, have received less attention than other types of SVs due to the
computational challenges in their detection from short read sequencing data,
which inherently involves de novo assembly. De novo assembly is not only
computationally challenging, but also requires high-quality data. While the
reads from a single individual may not always meet this requirement, using
reads from multiple individuals can increase power to detect novel insertions.
We have developed the program PopIns, which can discover and characterize
non-reference insertions of 100 bp or longer on a population scale. In this
paper, we describe the approach we implemented in PopIns. It takes as input a
reads-to-reference alignment, assembles unaligned reads using a standard
assembly tool, merges the contigs of different individuals into high-confidence
sequences, anchors the merged sequences into the reference genome, and finally
genotypes all individuals for the discovered insertions. Our tests on simulated
data indicate that the merging step greatly improves the quality and
reliability of predicted insertions and that PopIns shows significantly better
recall and precision than the recent tool MindTheGap. Preliminary results on a
data set of 305 Icelanders demonstrate the practicality of the new approach.

Motivated by applications in genomic data integration, we propose a new
framework of structured matrix completion (SMC) to treat structured missingness
by design. Specifically, our proposed method aims at efficient matrix recovery
when a subset of the rows and columns of an approximately low-rank matrix are
observed. We provide theoretical justification for the proposed SMC method and
derive lower bound for the estimation errors, which together establish the
optimal rate of recovery over certain classes of approximately low-rank
matrices. Simulation studies show that the method performs well in finite
sample under a variety of configurations. The method is applied to integrate
several ovarian cancer genomic studies with different extent of genomic
measurements, which enables us to construct more accurate prediction rules for

multi-band afterglows unveil the late-time activities of the central engines.
GRB 100814A is a special one among the well-sampled events, with complex
temporal and spectral evolution. The single power-law shallow decay index of
the optical light curve observed by GROND between 640 s and 10 ks is
$\alpha_{\rm opt} = 0.57 \pm 0.02$, which apparently conflicts with the simple
external shock model expectation. Especially, there is a remarkable
rebrightening in the optical to near infrared bands at late time, challenging
the external shock model with synchrotron emission coming from the interaction
of the blast wave with the surrounding interstellar medium. In this paper, we
invoke a magnetar with spin evolution to explain the complex multi-band
afterglow emission of GRB 100814A. The initial shallow decay phase in optical
bands and the plateau in X-ray can be explained as due to energy injection from
a spin-down magnetar. At late time, with the falling of materials from the
fall-back disk onto the central object of the burster, angular momentum of the
accreted materials is transferred to the magnetar, which leads to a spin-up
process. As a result, the magnetic dipole radiation luminosity will increase,
resulting in the significant rebrightening of the optical afterglow. It is
shown that the observed multi-band afterglow emission can be well reproduced by
the model.

coherent states and exists periodically in the phase space. It is unlike solids
or Abrikosov lattices that are observable in physical systems. Abrikosov
lattices are vortices closely packed into a lattice with a flux quantum through
a unit cell. Although Abrikosov lattices appear generally in various physical
systems, vortex lattices with multiple-flux quantums through a unit cell are
more stable than Abrikosov lattices in some physical regimes of the systems
with non-local interactions between particles. No theory is able to describe
these vortex lattices today. Here, we develop a theory for these vortex
lattices by extending von Neumann lattices to the coordinate space with a unit
cell of area that is proportional to flux quantums through a unit cell. The von
Neumann lattices not only show the same physical properties as the Abrikosov
lattice, but also describe vortex lattices with multiple-flux quantums through
a unit cell. From numerical simulations of a rapidly rotating dipole-blockaded
gas, we confirm that vortex lattices showed in our simulations are the
representation of von Neumann lattices in the coordinate space. We anticipate
our theory to be a starting point for developing more sophisticated
vortex-lattice models. For example, the effect of Landau-level mixing on vortex
lattice structures, vortices formed inside superfluid droplets and structural
phase transitions of vortex matter in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates
will be relevant for such developments.

be well described by the sum of two Maxwell models with very different
temperature behaviors: the slower one ($\tau _1 \simeq 10^{-4}$ s) is probably
due to reptation, and its associated viscosity first increases with temperature
(micellar growth) and then decreases after reaching a maximum (appearance of
connections). The fast mechanism ($\tau _2 \simeq 10^{-6}$ s) remains
practically unchanged in temperature and can be related to the relaxation of
local micellar order, as observed at higher concentration in a previous
investigation. This interpretation is confirmed by additional measurements in
aqueous mixtures of the related surfactant C$_{12}$EO$_8$ (which forms smaller
micelles), where only the fast mechanism -related to local order- is detected.

In this paper, we report on the result of the second phase of the campaign,
during 2013--2014, and the measurements of five new H$\beta$ time lags out of
eight monitored AGNs. All five objects were identified as super-Eddington
accreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs). The highest measured accretion rates
for the objects in this campaign are $\dot{\mathscr{M}}\gtrsim 200$, where
$\dot{\mathscr{M}}= \dot{M}_{\bullet}/L_{\rm Edd}c^{-2}$, $\dot{M}_{\bullet}$
is the mass accretion rates, $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity and $c$
is the speed of light. We find that the H$\beta$ time lags in SEAMBHs are
significantly shorter than those measured in sub-Eddington AGNs, and the
deviations increase with increasing accretion rates. Thus, the relationship
between broad-line region size ($R_{_{\rm H\beta}}$) and optical luminosity at
5100\AA, $R_{_{\rm H\beta}}-L_{5100}$, requires accretion rate as an additional
parameter. We propose that much of the effect may be due to the strong
anisotropy of the emitted slim-disk radiation. Scaling $R_{_{\rm H\beta}}$ by
the gravitational radius of the black hole, we define a new radius-mass
parameter ($Y$) and show that it saturates at a critical accretion rate of
$\dot{\mathscr{M}}_c=6\sim 30$, indicating a transition from thin to slim
accretion disk and a saturated luminosity of the slim disks. The parameter $Y$
is a very useful probe for understanding the various types of accretion onto
massive black holes. We briefly comment on implications to the general
population of super-Eddington AGNs in the universe and applications to
cosmology.

According to calculations by Bersten et al. (2014), the progenitor should have
a mass $\approx3.5M_\odot$ to reproduce the supernova light curve, and such
compact stars could only be produced via binary evolution. This is one of the
reasons that we expect the progenitor to be a binary, but it should be
confirmed by observing the remaining companion after the supernova. Their
evolutionary calculations suggest that the companion star will be an
overluminous OB star at the moment of supernova. With a combination of
hydrodynamical and evolutionary simulations, we find that the secondary star
will be heated by the supernova ejecta and expand to have larger luminosities

super giant, and this should be taken into account when searching for the
companion star in the supernova ejecta in future observations.

cross-helicity. Our results can now be used straightforwardly for studying the
transport of charged energetic particles, where the elements of the diffusion
tensor can now benefit from the self-consistently computed solar wind

MOOCs among teachers and students in a higher education institution in Oman. We
have also collected the details about MOOCs implementation and usage within
Oman educational society. Based on the collected information, we have evaluated
and presented the findings about MOOCs impact in Oman higher education. We have
felt that doing appropriate improvements in MOOCs may become an imperative
medium in Oman educational institutions. The suggestions are listed in the

possible combinations of two or more variables at any sets of locations in a
continuously indexed domain. Multivariate spatial covariance models need to be
built with care, since any covariance matrix that is derived from such a model
must be nonnegative-definite. In this article, we develop a conditional
approach for spatial-model construction whose validity conditions are easy to
check. We start with bivariate spatial covariance models and go on to
demonstrate the approach's connection to multivariate models defined by
networks of spatial variables. In some circumstances, such as modelling
respiratory illness conditional on air pollution, the direction of conditional
dependence is clear. When it is not, the two directional models can be
compared. More generally, the graph structure of the network reduces the number
of possible models to compare. Model selection then amounts to finding possible
causative links in the network. We demonstrate our conditional approach on
surface temperature and pressure data, where the role of the two variables is
seen to be asymmetric.

recipes based on the Balmer decrement and the 24mic luminosities. We show that
the L(Halpha) derived with different corrections give consistent results only
whenever the uncertainty on the estimate of the Balmer decrement is <=0.1. We
use these data to derive the SFR of the late-type galaxies of the sample, and
compare these estimates to those determined using independent monochromatic
tracers (FUV, radio) or the output of SED fitting codes. This comparison
suggests that the 24mic based dust extinction correction for Halpha might be
non universal, and that it should be used with caution in all objects with a
SFA, where dust heating can be dominated by the old stellar population.
Furthermore, because of the sudden truncation of the SFA of cluster galaxies
occurring after their interaction with the surrounding environment, the
stationarity conditions required to transform monochromatic fluxes into SFR
might not always be satisfied in tracers other than L(Halpha). In a similar
way, the parametrisation of the SFH generally used in SED fitting codes might
not be adequate for these recently interacting systems. We then study the SFR
luminosity distribution and the typical scaling relations of late-type
galaxies. We observe a systematic decrease of the SSFR with increasing stellar
mass, stellar mass surface density, and metallicity. We also observe an
increase of the asymmetry and smoothness parameters measured in the Halpha-band
with increasing SSFR, probably induced by an increase of the contribution of
giant HII regions to the Halpha luminosity function in SF low-luminosity
galaxies.

associated with a confined eruption of a prominence using TRACE, RHESSI, and
NoRH observations. The pre-flare phase of this event is characterized by
spectacular large-scale contraction of overlying extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
coronal loops during which the loop system was subjected to an altitude
decrease of ~20 Mm for an extended span of ~30 min. This contraction phase is
accompanied by sequential EUV brightenings associated with hard X-ray (HXR) (up
to 25 keV) and microwave (MW) sources from low-lying loops in the core of the
flaring region which together with X-ray spectra indicate strong localized
heating in the source region before the filament activation and associated
M-class flare. With the onset of the impulsive phase of the M6.2 flare, we
detect HXR and MW sources that exhibit intricate temporal and spatial evolution
in relation with the fast rise of the prominence. Following the flare maximum,
the filament eruption slowed down and subsequently confined within the large
overlying active region loops; the event did not lead to a coronal mass
ejection (CME). During the confinement process of the erupting prominence, we
detect MW emission from the extended coronal region with multiple emission
centroids which likely represent emission from hot blobs of plasma formed after
the collapse of the expanding flux rope and entailing prominence material.
RHESSI observations reveal high plasma temperature (~30 MK) and substantial
non-thermal characteristics with electron spectral index (~5) during the
impulsive phase of the flare. The time-evolution of thermal energy exhibits a
good correspondence with the variations in cumulative non-thermal energy which
suggest that the energy of accelerated particles efficiently converted to hot
flare plasma implying an effective validation of the Neupert effect.

not as straightforward as for the more conventional photoabsorption experiments
conducted on equilibrium systems. In fact, the relation between the transient
photoabsorption spectrum and the properties of the examined sample can be
rather intricate since the former is a complicated functional of both the
driving pump and the feeble probe fields. In this work we critically review the
derivation of the time-resolved photoabsorption spectrum in terms of the
nonequilibrium dipole response function $\chi$ and assess its domain of
validity. We then analyze $\chi$ in detail and discuss a few exact properties
useful to interpret the transient spectrum {\em during} (overlapping regime)
and {\em after} (nonoverlapping regime) the action of the pump. The
nonoverlapping regime is the simplest to address. The absorption energies are
indeed independent of the delay between the pump and probe pulses and hence the
transient spectrum can change only by a rearrangement of the spectral weights.
We give a close expression of these spectral weights in two limiting cases
(ultrashort and everlasting monochromatic probes) and highlight their strong
dependence on coherence and probe-envelope. In the overlapping regime we obtain
a Lehmann-like representation of $\chi$ in terms of light-dressed states and
provide a unifying framework of various well known effects in pump-driven
systems. We also show the emergence of spectral sub-structures due to the
finite duration of the pump pulse.

radio galaxies with {\em Suzaku} for understanding the origin of their X-ray
emissions. The {\em Suzaku} spectra for five of those have been presented
previously, while the remaining three (M\,87, PKS\,0625$-$354, and 3C\,78) are
presented here for the first time. Based on the Fe-K line strength, X-ray
variability, and X-ray power-law photon indices, and using additional
information on the [O III] line emission, we argue for a jet origin of the
observed X-ray emission in these three sources. We also analyzed five years of
{\em Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) GeV gamma-ray data on PKS\,0625$-$354
and 3C\,78 to understand these sources within the blazar picture. We found
significant $\gamma$-ray variability in the former object. Overall, we note
that the {\em Suzaku} spectra for both PKS\,0625$-$354 and 3C\,78 are rather
soft, while the LAT spectra are unusually hard when compared with other
$\gamma$-ray detected low-power (FR\,I) radio galaxies. We demonstrate that the
constructed broad-band spectral energy distributions of PKS\,0625$-$354 and
3C\,78 are well described by a one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron self-Compton
model. The results of the modeling indicate lower bulk Lorentz factors compared
to those typically found in other BL Lac objects, but consistent with the
values inferred from modeling other LAT-detected FR\,I radio galaxies.
Interestingly, the modeling also implies very high peak ($\sim 10^{16}$\,Hz)
synchrotron frequencies in the two analyzed sources, contrary to
previously-suggested scenarios for FR I/BL Lac unification. We discuss the
implications of our findings in the context of the FR\,I/BL Lac unification
schemes.

uncertainty, this paper proposes a Bayesian inferential framework that provides
a simple 6-parameter representation of ensemble forecasting systems and the
corresponding observations. The framework is probabilistic, and thus allows for
quantifying uncertainty in predictability measures such as correlation skill
and signal-to-noise ratios. It also provides a natural way to produce
recalibrated probabilistic predictions from uncalibrated ensembles forecasts.
The framework is used to address important questions concerning the skill of
winter hindcasts of the North Atlantic Oscillation for 1992-2011 issued by the
Met Office GloSea5 climate prediction system. Although there is much
uncertainty in the correlation between ensemble mean and observations, there is
strong evidence of skill: the 95% credible interval of the correlation
coefficient of [0.19,0.68] does not overlap zero. There is also strong evidence
that the forecasts are not exchangeable with the observations: With over 99%
certainty, the signal-to-noise ratio of the forecasts is smaller than the
signal-to-noise ratio of the observations, which suggests that raw forecasts
should not be taken as representative scenarios of the observations. Forecast
recalibration is thus required, which can be coherently addressed within the

amenable to computation the perimeter functional is relaxed using a gradient
energy functional together with an obstacle potential in which there is an

Gamma-convergence to the functional with perimeter regularisation as epsilon
tends to zero. The computational approach is based on a finite element

The microwave loss is most effectively reduced when the Abrikosov vortex
lattice spatially matches the underlying washboard pinning landscape. The
forward transmission coefficient $S_{21}(f)$ of the microstrip has a dc-tunable
cut-off frequency $f_d$ which notably changes under dc bias reversal, due to
the two different slope steepnesses of the pinning landscape. The device's
operation principle relies upon a crossover from the weakly dissipative
response of vortices at low frequencies when they are driven over the grooves,
to the strongly dissipative response at high frequencies when the vortices are
oscillating within one groove. The filter's cut-off frequency is the vortex
depinning frequency tunable by the dc bias as it diminishes the pinning effect
induced by the nanopattern. The reported results unveil an advanced microwave
functionality of superconducting films with asymmetric (ratchet) pinning
landscapes and are relevant for tuning the microwave loss in superconducting

sets related to human mobility such as GPS traces, mobile phone data, etc., it
is still true that such data sets represent a subsample of the population of
interest, and then might give an incomplete picture of the entire population in
question. Notwithstanding the abundant usage of such inherently limited data
sets, the impact of sampling biases on mobility patterns is unclear -- we do
not have methods available to reliably infer mobility information from a
limited data set. Here, we investigate the effects of sampling using a data set
of millions of taxi movements in New York City. On the one hand, we show that
mobility patterns are highly stable once an appropriate simple rescaling is
applied to the data, implying negligible loss of information due to subsampling
over long time scales. On the other hand, contrasting an appropriate null model
on the weighted network of vehicle flows reveals distinctive features which
need to be accounted for. Accordingly, we formulate a ""supersampling""
methodology which allows us to reliably extrapolate mobility data from a
reduced sample and propose a number of network-based metrics to reliably assess
its quality (and that of other human mobility models). Our approach provides a
well founded way to exploit temporal patterns to save effort in recording
mobility data, and opens the possibility to scale up data from limited records
when information on the full system is needed.

in 1996 for the oxidation of carbon monoxide over a platinum catalyst using a
Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The main observation was a simplification of
the mechanism at ignition and extinction points. The critical simplification is
an example of a much more general phenomenon that we call \emph{a bifurcational
parametric simplification}. Ignition and extinction points are points of
equilibrium multiplicity bifurcations, i.e., they are points of a corresponding
bifurcation set for parameters.
  Any bifurcation produces a dependence between system parameters. This is a
mathematical explanation and/or justification of the ""parametric
simplification"". It leads us to a conjecture that ""maximal bifurcational
parametric simplification"" corresponds to the ""maximal bifurcation complexity.""
  This conjecture can have practical applications for experimental study,
because at points of ""maximal bifurcation complexity"" the number of independent
system parameters is minimal and all other parameters can be evaluated
analytically or numerically.
  We illustrate this method by the case of the simplest possible bifurcation,
that is a multiplicity bifurcation of equilibrium and we apply this analysis to
the Langmuir mechanism. Our analytical study is based on a coordinate-free
version of the method of invariant manifolds (proposed recently in 2006 ). As a
result we obtain a more accurate description of the ""critical (parametric)
simplifications.""

social diversification to a 100% contribution and 0% contribution through
so-called evolutionary branching. Until now, however, game-theoretical studies
have shed little light on the evolutionary dynamics and consequences of the

quadratic payoff functions in dimorphic populations. Subsequently, conditions
are clarified under which gradual evolution can lead a population consisting of

facilitate social inequity aversion in joint ventures that otherwise could

d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard published in 1713 contains correspondence on
probability problems between Montmort and Nicolaus Bernoulli. This
correspondence begins in 1710. The last published letter, dated November 15,
1713, is from Montmort to Nicolaus Bernoulli. There is some discussion of the
strategy of play in the card game Le Her and a bit of news that Montmort's
friend Waldegrave in Paris was going to take care of the printing of the book.
From earlier correspondence between Bernoulli and Montmort, it is apparent that
Waldegrave had also analyzed Le Her and had come up with a mixed strategy as a
solution. He had also suggested working on the ""problem of the pool,"" or what
is often called Waldegrave's problem. The Universit\""{a}tsbibliothek Basel
contains an additional forty-two letters between Bernoulli and Montmort written
after 1713, as well as two letters between Bernoulli and Waldegrave. The
letters are all in French, and here we provide translations of key passages.
The trio continued to discuss probability problems, particularly Le Her which
was still under discussion when the Essay d'analyse went to print. We describe
the probability content of this body of correspondence and put it in its
historical context. We also provide a proper identification of Waldegrave based
on manuscripts in the Archives nationales de France in Paris.

widely used technique in epidemiology and biostatistics. As single markers tend
to explain only a small proportion of phenotypic variation, there is increasing
interest in using multiple genetic markers to obtain more precise estimates of
causal parameters. Structural mean models (SMMs) are semiparametric models that
use instrumental variables to identify causal parameters. Recently, interest
has started to focus on using these models with multiple instruments,
particularly for multiplicative and logistic SMMs. In this paper we show how
additive, multiplicative and logistic SMMs with multiple orthogonal binary
instrumental variables can be estimated efficiently in models with no further
(continuous) covariates, using the generalised method of moments (GMM)
estimator. We discuss how the Hansen J-test can be used to test for model
misspecification, and how standard GMM software routines can be used to fit
SMMs. We further show that multiplicative SMMs, like the additive SMM, identify
a weighted average of local causal effects if selection is monotonic. We use
these methods to reanalyse a study of the relationship between adiposity and
hypertension using SMMs with two genetic markers as instruments for adiposity.
We find strong effects of adiposity on hypertension.

atomistic level is of utmost importance. Often the systems of interest are of
macroscopic size but can be partitioned into few important degrees of freedom
which are treated most accurately and others which constitute a thermal bath.
Particular attention in this respect attracts the linear generalized Langevin
equation (GLE), which can be rigorously derived by means of a linear projection
(LP) technique. Within this framework a complicated interaction with the bath
can be reduced to a single memory kernel. This memory kernel in turn is
parametrized for a particular system studied, usually by means of time-domain
methods based on explicit molecular dynamics data. Here we discuss that this
task is most naturally achieved in frequency domain and develop a Fourier-based
parametrization method that outperforms its time-domain analogues. Very
surprisingly, the widely used rigid bond method turns out to be inappropriate
in general. Importantly, we show that the rigid bond approach leads to a
systematic underestimation of relaxation times, unless the system under study
consists of a harmonic bath bi-linearly coupled to the relevant degrees of
freedom.

stellar-mass and supermassive black hole candidates originates from X-ray
fluorescence of the inner accretion disk. Accordingly, it can be used to map
the spacetime geometry around these objects. In this paper, we extend previous
work using the iron K$\alpha$ line to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. We
adopt the Cardoso-Pani-Rico parametrization and we test the possibility of
constraining possible deviations from the Kerr solution that can be obtained
from observations across the range of black hole spins and inclination angles.
We confirm previous claims that the iron K$\alpha$ line is potentially a quite
powerful probe for testing the Kerr metric given sufficiently high quality data
and with systematics under control, especially in the case of fast-rotating
black holes and high inclination angles since both conditions serve to maximize
relativistic effects. We find that some geometric perturbations from Kerr
geometry manifest more strongly in the iron line profile than others. While the
perturbation parameter $\epsilon^t_3$ can be well constrained by the iron line

estimate the contribution of blazars to the X-ray and gamma-ray extragalactic

100% of the cosmic background at energies larger than ~10 GeV, and contribute
~40 to 70% of the gamma-ray diffuse radiation between 100 MeV and 10 GeV. The
contribution of blazars to the X-ray background, between 1 and 50 keV, is
approximately constant and of the order of 4-5%. On the basis of an
interpolation between the estimated flux at X-ray and gamma-ray energies we can
expect that the contribution of blazars raises to ~10% at 100 keV, and
continues to increase with energy until it becomes the dominant component at a
few MeV. Finally, we show that a strong dependence of the synchrotron peak
frequency on luminosity, as postulated by the ""blazar sequence"", is ruled out
by the observational data as it predicts a gamma-ray background above a few GeV

combined. For a pair of given input images geodesic paths in the space of
images are defined as minimizers of a resulting path energy. To this end, the
underlying Riemannian metric measures the rate of transport cost and the rate
of viscous dissipation. Furthermore, the model is capable to deal with strongly
varying image contrast and explicitly allows for sources and sinks in the
transport equations which are incorporated in the metric related to the
metamorphosis approach by Trouv\'e and Younes. In the non-viscous case with
source term existence of geodesic paths is proven in the space of measures. The
proposed model is explored on the range from merely optimal transport to
strongly dissipative dynamics. For this model a robust and effective
variational time discretization of geodesic paths is proposed. This requires to
minimize a discrete path energy consisting of a sum of consecutive image
matching functionals. These functionals are defined on corresponding pairs of
intensity functions and on associated pairwise matching deformations. Existence
of time discrete geodesics is demonstrated. Furthermore, a finite element
implementation is proposed and applied to instructive test cases and to real
images. In the non-viscous case this is compared to the algorithm proposed by
Benamou and Brenier including a discretization of the source term. Finally, the
model is generalized to define discrete weighted barycentres with applications

$r$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$. We investigate
the functors $\mathcal{F}_i$ from $kE$-modules of constant Jordan type to
vector bundles on $\mathbb{P}^{r-1}(k)$, constructed by Benson and Pevtsova.
For a $kE$-module $M$ of constant Jordan type, we show that restricting the
sheaf $\mathcal{F}_i(M)$ to a dimension $s-1$ linear subvariety of
$\mathbb{P}^{r-1}(k)$ is equivalent to restricting $M$ along a corresponding
rank $s$ shifted subgroup of $kE$ and then applying $\mathcal{F}_i$.
  In the case $r=2$, we examine the generic kernel filtration of $M$ in order
to show that $\mathcal{F}_i(M)$ may be computed on certain subquotients of $M$
whose Loewy lengths are bounded in terms of $i$. More precise information is
obtained by applying similar techniques to the $n$th power generic kernel
filtration of $M$. The latter approach also allows us to generalise our results
to higher ranks $r$.

improves on the previous fastest algorithm, the deterministic
$\widetilde{O}(4^{n})$-time and $\widetilde{O}(2^{n})$-space algorithm of
Micciancio and Voulgaris.
  We achieve our main result in three steps. First, we show how to modify the
sampling algorithm from [ADRS15] to solve the problem of discrete Gaussian
sampling over lattice shifts, $L- t$, with very low parameters. While the
actual algorithm is a natural generalization of [ADRS15], the analysis uses
substantial new ideas. This yields a $2^{n+o(n)}$-time algorithm for
approximate CVP for any approximation factor $\gamma = 1+2^{-o(n/\log n)}$.
Second, we show that the approximate closest vectors to a target vector $t$ can
be grouped into ""lower-dimensional clusters,"" and we use this to obtain a
recursive reduction from exact CVP to a variant of approximate CVP that
""behaves well with these clusters."" Third, we show that our discrete Gaussian
sampling algorithm can be used to solve this variant of approximate CVP.
  The analysis depends crucially on some new properties of the discrete
Gaussian distribution and approximate closest vectors, which might be of
independent interest.

  Image Sequence Recovery","33 pages, 7 figures",,,,"math.AP math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The estimation of motion in an image sequence is a fundamental task in image
processing. Frequently, the image sequence is corrupted by noise and one
simultaneously asks for the underlying motion field and a restored sequence. In
smoothly shaded regions of the restored image sequence the brightness constancy
assumption along motion paths leads to a pointwise differential condition on
the motion field. At object boundaries which are edge discontinuities both for
the image intensity and for the motion field this condition is no longer well
defined. In this paper a total-variation type functional is discussed for joint
image restoration and motion estimation. This functional turns out not to be
lower semicontinuous, and in particular fine-scale oscillations may appear
around edges. By the general theory of vector valued $BV$ functionals its
relaxation leads to the appearance of a singular part of the energy density,
which can be determined by the solution of a local minimization problem at
edges. Based on bounds for the singular part of the energy and under
appropriate assumptions on the local intensity variation one can exclude the
existence of microstructures and obtain a model well-suited for simultaneous
image restoration and motion estimation. Indeed, the relaxed model incorporates
a generalized variational formulation of the brightness constancy assumption.
The analytical findings are related to ambiguity problems in motion estimation
such as the proper distinction between foreground and background motion at
object edges.

topology and the polarization structure on parsec scale and their evolution

and it varies with frequency, location and time. In the core region we measure
a mean fractional polarization of about 1-2%, with a peak of about 4% in March
at 43 GHz; the polarization angle is almost stable at 43 GHz, but it shows
significant variability in the range 114-173 deg at 15 GHz. In the jet region
the polarization properties show a more stable behavior; the fractional
polarization is about 16% and the polarization angle is nearly perpendicular to
the jet axis. The higher EVPA variability observed at 15 GHz is due both to a
variable Faraday rotation effect and to opacity. The residual variability
observed in the intrinsic polarization angle, together with the low degree of

In this E-world our traditional books are losing their values. Recent surveys
are proving that the younger generations are not much interested in visiting
libraries and reading books due to their addiction towards the electronic
gadgets. Many publishers are now changed their strategy by publishing and
promoting ebooks. Academicians are also badly affected by this trend and they
are forced to motivate the students to improve their reading habits for their
better performance in the institutions and to be responsible citizens of a
country.
  There are many difficulties faced by the ebook readers and it discourages the
people to read an ebook for long time like a normal printed book. The main
objective of this paper is to introduce a hybrid Ebook which is capable of
having audio and video files also in it. This makes the people to read the
e-book with modern electronic formats. This multimedia facility makes the
people to read or listen or watch the ebooks for long time. We have quoted the
survey results which prove that the students prefer to read hybrid books than
normal ebooks or the printed handouts in College of Applied Sciences, Oman.
Still we feel these books should have few more facilities, so that people who
like traditional books will also adopt these ebooks, without losing the
satisfaction of reading printed books. These things are listed in the
recommendations and conclusion section.

limited lab sessions within the environment of higher Institutions of learning
throughout the world. The Institutions focus mostly on effective use of
available resources i.e. a lab may have few lab sessions scheduled within a day
for different courses. Hence a particular lab session must begin and end on
time. A slow student who did not complete his/her lab exercise must vacate the
lab because another class is about to commence. Hence using free software tools
such as OPNET IT guru, Packet trace and NS2 will help the student to learn
beyond the College time. A Student will gain an insight into Computer

that is 75 percent larger than the previous best dataset on nuclear incidents
and accidents, comparing three measures of severity: INES (International
Nuclear Event Scale), radiation released, and damage dollar losses. The annual
rate of nuclear accidents, with size above 20 Million US$, per plant, decreased
from the 1950s until dropping significantly after Chernobyl (April, 1986). The
rate is now roughly stable at 0.002 to 0.003, i.e., around 1 event per year
across the current fleet. The distribution of damage values changed after Three
Mile Island (TMI; March, 1979), where moderate damages were suppressed but the
tail became very heavy, being described by a Pareto distribution with tail
index 0.55. Further, there is a runaway disaster regime, associated with the
""dragon-king"" phenomenon, amplifying the risk of extreme damage. In fact, the
damage of the largest event (Fukushima; March, 2011) is equal to 60 percent of
the total damage of all 174 accidents in our database since 1946. In dollar
losses we compute a 50% chance that (i) a Fukushima event (or larger) occurs in
the next 50 years, (ii) a Chernobyl event (or larger) occurs in the next 27
years and (iii) a TMI event (or larger) occurs in the next 10 years. Finally,
we find that the INES scale is inconsistent. To be consistent with damage, the
Fukushima disaster would need to have an INES level of 11, rather than the
maximum of 7.

gravitationally interacting bosonic and fermionic quantum fields arise from the
generic discrete distribution of many quantifiable properties of arbitrary
static entities. Alternate presentations of the smooth coarse-graining (fit)
for this discrete distribution compose probability-related evolving wave
function of the fields' dynamical modes. Their gauge modes, being symmetry
transformations, and constrained modes require no additional material
structure. We prove that evolution of any origin for which the quantum
superposition principle is absolute cannot be governed by specific laws. In
contrast, locally supersymmetric quantum fields that emerge as described from
the basic discrete distribution evolve by unchanging and closed physical laws.
The emergent quantum evolution is many-world; yet its Everett's branches whose
norm diminishes below a positive threshold cease to exist. Then some
experiments that for the standard Everett view would seem safe are instead
fatal for the participants. The Born rule arises dynamically in emergent
systems with extended regular past. It and, consequently, quasi-deterministic
macroscopic evolution emerge in systems that allow cosmological inflation but
not in typical random ones. This resolves the Boltzmann brain problem. We
explain how inflation creates new physical degrees of freedom around the Planck
scale. Quantum entanglement for the emergent fields is trivial because their
wave function, up to its representation, is material.

candidate genomic regions have been developed. We propose to perform
genome-wide scans of natural selection using principal component analysis. We
show that the common Fst index of genetic differentiation between populations
can be viewed as a proportion of variance explained by the principal
components. Considering the correlations between genetic variants and each
principal component provides a conceptual framework to detect genetic variants
involved in local adaptation without any prior definition of populations. To
validate the PCA-based approach, we consider the 1000 Genomes data (phase 1)
after removal of recently admixed individuals resulting in 850 individuals
coming from Africa, Asia, and Europe. The number of genetic variants is of the
order of 36 millions obtained with a low-coverage sequencing depth (3X). The
correlations between genetic variation and each principal component provide
well-known targets for positive selection (EDAR, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, DARC), and
also new candidate genes (APPBPP2, TP1A1, RTTN, KCNMA, MYO5C) and non-coding
RNAs. In addition to identifying genes involved in biological adaptation, we
identify two biological pathways involved in polygenic adaptation that are
related to the innate immune system (beta defensins) and to lipid metabolism
(fatty acid omega oxidation). An additional analysis of European data shows
that a genome scan based on PCA retrieves classical examples of local
adaptation even when there are no well-defined populations. PCA-based
statistics, implemented in the PCAdapt R package and the PCAdapt open-source
software, retrieve well-known signals of human adaptation, which is encouraging
for future whole-genome sequencing project, especially when defining
populations is difficult.
