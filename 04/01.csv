magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Recent studies suggest a coupled nature of the
most prominent phenomena: umbral flashes (UFs) and running penumbral waves
(RPWs). From an observational point of view, we perform a height-dependent
study of RPWs, compare their wave characteristics and aim to track down these
so far only chromospherically observed phenomena to photospheric layers to
prove the upward propagating field-guided nature of RPWs. We analyze a time
series (58\,min) of multi-wavelength observations of an isolated circular
sunspot (NOAA11823) taken at high spatial and temporal resolution in
spectroscopic mode with the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectro-polarimeter
(IBIS/DST). By means of a multi-layer intensity sampling, velocity comparisons,
wavelet power analysis and sectorial studies of time-slices, we retrieve the
power distribution, characteristic periodicities and propagation
characteristics of sunspot waves at photospheric and chromospheric levels.
Signatures of RPWs are found at photospheric layers. Those continuous
oscillations occur preferably at periods between 4-6\,min starting at the inner
penumbral boundary. The photospheric oscillations all have a slightly delayed,
more defined chromospheric counterpart with larger relative velocities (which
are linked to preceding UF events). In all layers the power of RPWs follows a
filamentary fine-structure and shows a typical ring-shaped power distribution
increasing in radius for larger wave periods. The analysis of time-slices
reveals apparent horizontal velocities for RPWs at photospheric layers of
$\approx50\,\rm{km/s}$ which decrease to $\approx30\,\rm{km/s}$ at
chromospheric heights. The observations strongly support the scenario of RPWs
being upward propagating slow-mode waves guided by the magnetic field lines.

  http://www.ift.uni.wroc.pl/~csqcdiv",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Isolated pulsars are rotating neutron stars with accurately measured angular
velocities $\Omega$, and their time derivatives which show unambiguously that
the pulsars are slowing down. Although the exact mechanism of the spin-down is
a question of debate, the commonly accepted view is that it arises either
through emission of magnetic dipole radiation (MDR) from a rotating magnetized
body, through emission of a relativistic particle wind, or via higher order
magnetic multipole or gravitational quadrupole radiation. The calculated energy
loss by a rotating pulsar is model dependent and leads to the power law
$\dot{\Omega}$ = -K $\Omega^{\rm n}$ where $n$ is called the braking index. The
theoretical value for braking index is $n = 1, 3, 5$ for wind, MDR, quadrupole
radiation respectively. The accepted view is that pulsar braking is strongly
dominated by MDR. Highly precise observations of isolated pulsars yield braking
index values in the range $1 < n < 2.8$ which are consistently less than the
value predicted from the MDR model. We discuss possible ways to bring theory
closer to observation for the MDR, and also consider how the other mechanisms
may play a role in future study of the braking index problem.

discrepancies between the ages of exoplanet host stars estimated using stellar
models (isochronal ages) and age estimates based on the stars' rotation periods
(gyrochronological ages). We have compiled a sample of 28 transiting exoplanet
host stars with measured rotation periods. We use a Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo method to determine the joint posterior distribution for the mass and age
of each star in the sample, and extend this method to include a calculation of
the posterior distribution of the gyrochronological age. The gyrochronological
age ($\tau_{\rm gyro}$) is significantly less than the isochronal age for about
half of the stars in our sample. Tidal interactions between the star and planet
are a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy in some cases, but not all.
The distribution of $\tau_{\rm gyro}$ values is evenly spread from very young
ages up to a maximum value of a few Gyr. There is no clear correlation between
$\tau_{\rm gyro}$ and the strength of the tidal force on the star due to the
innermost planet. There is clear evidence that the isochronal ages for some
K-type stars are too large, and this may also be the case for some G-type
stars. This may be the result of magnetic inhibition of convection. There is
currently no satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy between the young age
for CoRoT-2 estimated from either gyrochronology or its high lithium abundance,
and the extremely old age for its K-type stellar companion inferred from its
very low X-ray flux. There is now strong evidence that the gyrochronological
ages of some transiting exoplanet host stars are significantly less than their
isochronal ages, but it is not always clear that this is good evidence for
tidal interactions between the star and the planet.

making unit (DMU) in the non-radial DEA (data envelopment analysis) setting. As
our first contribution, we differentiate between three types of reference set.
First, we introduce the notion of unary reference set (URS) corresponding to a
given projection of an evaluated DMU. The URS includes efficient DMUs that are
active in a specific convex combination producing the projection. Because of
the occurrence of multiple URSs, we introduce the notion of maximal reference
set (MRS) and define it as the union of all the URSs associated with the given
projection. Since multiple projections may occur in non-radial DEA models, we
further define the union of the MRSs associated with all the projections as
unique global reference set (GRS) of the evaluated DMU. As the second
contribution, we propose and substantiate a general linear programming (LP)
based approach to identify the GRS. Since our approach makes the identification
through the execution of a single primal-based LP model, it is computationally
more efficient than the existing methods for its easy implementation in
practical applications. Our last contribution is to measure returns to scale
using a non-radial DEA model. This method effectively deals with the occurrence
of multiple supporting hyperplanes arising either from multiplicity of
projections or from non-full dimensionality of minimum face. Finally, an
empirical analysis is conducted based on a real-life data set to demonstrate
the ready applicability of our approach.

vibrations, namely, discrete breathers (DBs) can be excited either thermally or
by external triggering, in which the amplitude of atomic oscillations greatly
exceeds that of harmonic oscillations (phonons). Coherency and persistence of
large atomic oscillations in DBs may have drastic effect on quantum tunneling
due to correlation effects discovered by Schrodinger and Robertson in 1930.
These effects have been applied recently to the tunneling problem by Vysotskii
et al, who demonstrated a giant increase of sub-barrier transparency during the
increase of correlation coefficient at special high-frequency periodic action
on quantum system. In the present paper, it is argued that DBs present the most
natural and efficient way to produce correlation effects due to time-periodic
modulation of the potential well width and hence to act as breather
nano-colliders (BNC) triggering low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) in solids.
Tunneling probability for deuterium (D-D) fusion in gap DBs formed in metal
deuterides is shown to increase drastically with increasing number of
oscillations resulting in the observed LENR rate at extremely low
concentrations of DBs. Possible ways of engineering the nuclear active
environment based on the present concept are discussed.

bright proto-planetary nebulae (PPNs), all O-rich and of F spectral type. They
each display cyclical light curves with significant variations in amplitude.
All four were previously known to vary in light. Our data were combined with
published data and searched for periodicity. The results are as follows: IRAS
19475+3119 (HD 331319; 41.0 days), 17436+5003 (HD 161796; 45.2 days),
19386+0155 (101.8 days), and 18095+2704 (113.3 days). The two longer periods
are in agreement with previous studies while the two shorter periods each
reveal for the first time reveal a dominant period over these long observing
intervals. Multiple periods were also found for each object. The secondary
periods were all close to the dominant periods, with P2/P1 ranging from 0.86 to
1.06. The variations in color reveal maximum variations in T(eff) of 400 to 770
K. These variations are due to pulsations in these post-AGB objects. Maximum
seasonal light variations are all less than 0.23 mag (V), consistent for their
temperatures and periods with the results of Hrivnak et al. (2010) for 12
C-rich PPNs. For all of these PPNs, there is an inverse relationship between
period and temperature; however, there is a suggestion that the
period-temperature relationship may be somewhat steeper for the O-rich than for
the C-rich PPNs.

rigorous framework for carrying out embedded random matrix calculations. Using
particle diagrams and the attendant methodology including loop counting it
becomes possible to calculate the fourth, sixth and eighth moments of embedded
ensembles in a straightforward way. The method, which will be called the method
of particle diagrams, proves useful firstly by providing a means of classifying
the components of moments into particle paths, or loops, and secondly by giving
a simple algorithm for calculating the magnitude of combinatorial expressions
prior to calculating them explicitly. By confining calculations to the limit
case $m \ll l\to\infty$ this in many cases provides a sufficient excuse not to
calculate certain terms at all, since it can be foretold using the method of
particle diagrams that they will not survive in this asymptotic regime.
Applying the method of particle diagrams washes out a great deal of the
complexity intrinsic to the problem, with sufficient mathematical structure
remaining to yield limiting statistics for the unified phase space of random
matrix theories.
  Finally, since the unified form of random matrix theory is essentially the
set of all randomised k-body potentials, it should be no surprise that the
early statistics calculated for the unified random matrix theories in some
instances resemble the statistics currently being discovered for quantum spin
hypergraphs and other randomised potentials on graphs [HMH05,ES14,KLW14]. This
is just the beginning for studies into the field of unified random matrix
theories, or embedded ensembles, and the applicability of the method of
particle diagrams to a wide range of questions as well as to the more exotic
symmetry classes, such as the symplectic ensembles, is still an area of
open-ended research.

  http://www.ift.uni.wroc.pl/~csqcdiv",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Isolated pulsars are rotating neutron stars with accurately measured angular
velocities $\Omega$, and their time derivatives which show unambiguously that
the pulsars are slowing down. Although the exact mechanism of the spin-down is
a question of debate in detail, the commonly accepted view is that it arises
through emission of magnetic dipole radiation (MDR) from a rotating magnetized
body. Other processes, including the emission of gravitational radiation, and
of relativistic particles (pulsar wind), are also being considered. The
calculated energy loss by a rotating pulsar with a constant moment of inertia
is assumed proportional to a model dependent power of $\Omega$. This relation
leads to the power law $\dot{\Omega}$ = -K $\Omega^{\rm n}$ where $n$ is called
the braking index. The MDR model predicts $n$ exactly equal to 3. Selected
observations of isolated pulsars provide rather precise values of $n$,
individually accurate to a few percent or better, in the range 1$ <$ n $ < $
2.8, which is consistently less than the predictions of the MDR model. In spite
of an extensive investigation of various modifications of the MDR model, no
satisfactory explanation of observation has been found as yet.
  We employ four physically realistic equations of state, and two computational
codes, to model the dynamical effects of rotation on the braking index in the
MDR model. In addition to this we simulate an effect on moment of inertia where
we assume a certain amount of superfluid matter has manifest between the crust
and core region of the star thus essentially eliminating momentum transfer
between the two regions. We find that the effects of rotation on braking index
are significant at high frequencies, but have little effect at frequencies
consistent with the most accurately measured pulsars to-date.

by which such representations are formed in the first place remains unclear.
Here we examine how networks of spiking neurons can learn to encode for input
patterns using a fully temporal coding scheme. To this end, we introduce a
learning rule for spiking networks containing hidden neurons which optimizes
the likelihood of generating desired output spiking patterns. We show the
proposed learning rule allows for a large number of accurate input-output spike
pattern mappings to be learnt, which outperforms other existing learning rules
for spiking neural networks: both in the number of mappings that can be learnt
as well as the complexity of spike train encodings that can be utilised. The
learning rule is successful even in the presence of input noise, is
demonstrated to solve the linearly non-separable XOR computation and
generalizes well on an example dataset. We further present a biologically
plausible implementation of backpropagated learning in multilayer spiking
networks, and discuss the neural mechanisms that might underlie its function.
Our approach contributes both to a systematic understanding of how pattern
encodings might take place in the nervous system, and a learning rule that
displays strong technical capability.

such as FELs and ultra-fast electron diffraction can be degraded by the
asymmetric fields introduced by the RF couplers of superconducting linacs. This
effect is especially troublesome in the injector where the low energy beam from
the gun is captured into the first high gradient accelerator section.
Unfortunately modifying the established cavity design is expensive and time
consuming, especially considering that only one or two sections are needed for
an injector. Instead, it is important to analyze the coupler fields to
understand their characteristics and help find less costly solutions for their
cancellation and mitigation. This paper finds the RF coupler-induced emittance
for short bunches is mostly due to the transverse spatial sloping or tilt of
the field, rather than the field's time-dependence. It is shown that the
distorting effects of the coupler can be canceled with a static (DC) quadrupole
lens rotated about the z-axis.

Multilingual lexica together with the functional analysis of such structures
are useful tools for the hard task of translating discourse markers into
possible equivalents from one language to another. Using Daniel Marcu's
validated discourse markers for English, extracted from the Brown Corpus, our
purpose is to build multilingual lexica of discourse markers for other

this study is that the usage of a discourse marker is independent of the

one language is equivalent to the rhetorical function of the same discourse

vectors or complete depletion of the infectious reservoir in humans.
Mechanistic models can be built to synthesize diverse observations from the
field collected under a variety of conditions and subsequently used to query
the infectious reservoir in great detail. Methods The EMOD model of malaria
transmission was calibrated to prevalence, incidence, asexual parasite density,
gametocyte density, infection duration, and infectiousness data from 9 study
sites. The infectious reservoir was characterized by diagnostic detection limit
and age group over a range of transmission intensities with and without case
management and vector control. Mass screen-and-treat drug campaigns were tested
for likelihood of achieving elimination. Results The composition of the
infectious reservoir by diagnostic threshold is similar over a range of
transmission intensities, and higher intensity settings are biased toward
infections in children. Recent ramp-ups in case management and use of
insecticide-treated bednets reduce the infectious reservoir and shift the
composition toward submicroscopic infections. Mass campaigns with antimalarial
drugs are highly effective at interrupting transmission if deployed shortly
after ITN campaigns. Conclusions Low density infections comprise a substantial
portion of the infectious reservoir. Proper timing of vector control, seasonal
variation in transmission intensity, and mass drug campaigns allows lingering
population immunity to help drive a region toward elimination.

it to show that the dense center symmetric plasma develops, in the mean field

is massive due to the U$_A(1)$ axial-anomaly. We estimate the chiral condensate
and $\sigma,\eta$ meson masses for $N_f=1$. We then extend our analysis to
several flavors $N_f>1$ and colors $N_c>2$ and show that center symmetry and
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking disappear simultaneously when
$x=N_f/N_c\geq 2$ in the dense plasma phase. A reorganization of the dense

Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) can reduce transmission when
widely distributed in a campaign setting. Modelling mass antimalarial campaigns
can elucidate how to most effectively deploy drug-based interventions and
quantitatively compare the effects of cure, prophylaxis, and
transmission-blocking in suppressing parasite prevalence. A previously
established agent-based model that includes innate and adaptive immunity was
used to simulate malaria infections and transmission. Pharmacokinetics of
artemether, lumefantrine, dihydroartemisinin, piperaquine, and primaquine were
modelled with a double-exponential distribution-elimination model including
weight-dependent parameters and age-dependent dosing. Drug killing of asexual
parasites and gametocytes was calibrated to clinical data. Mass distribution of
ACTs and primaquine was simulated with seasonal mosquito dynamics at a range of
transmission intensities. A single mass campaign with antimalarial drugs is
insufficient to permanently reduce malaria prevalence when transmission is
high. Current diagnostics are insufficiently sensitive to accurately identify
asymptomatic infections, and mass-screen-and-treat campaigns are much less
efficacious than mass drug administrations. Improving campaign coverage leads
to decreased prevalence one month after the end of the campaign, while
increasing compliance lengthens the duration of protection against reinfection.
Use of a long-lasting prophylactic as part of a mass drug administration
regimen confers the most benefit under conditions of high transmission and
moderately high coverage. Addition of primaquine can reduce prevalence but
exerts its largest effect when coupled with a long-lasting prophylactic.

quality factors $Q$ as high as $5\times10^6$ in ultra-clean nanotube resonators
at a cryostat temperature of 30 mK, where we define $Q$ as the ratio of the
resonant frequency over the linewidth. Measuring such high quality factors
requires both employing an ultra-low noise method to detect minuscule
vibrations rapidly, and carefully reducing the noise of the electrostatic
environment. We observe that the measured quality factors fluctuate because of
fluctuations of the resonant frequency. The quality factors we measure are
record high; they are comparable to the highest $Q$ reported in mechanical
resonators of much larger size, a remarkable result considering that reducing
the size of resonators is usually concomitant with decreasing quality factors.
The combination of ultra-low size and very large $Q$ offers new opportunities

the passage of nutrients into the brain and protects it from toxins in the
blood. To better understand the effect of shock waves on the BBB we have
investigated an {\em in vitro} model in which BBB endothelial cells are grown
in transwell vessels and exposed in a shock tube, confirming that BBB integrity
is directly related to shock wave intensity. It is difficult to directly
measure the forces acting on these cells in the transwell container during the
experiments, and so a computational tool has been developed and presented in
this paper.
  Two-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations with the Tammann equation of
state were used to model the transwell materials, and a high-resolution finite
volume method based on Riemann solvers and the Clawpack software was used to
solve these equations in a mixed Eulerian/Lagrangian frame. Results indicated
that the geometry of the transwell plays a significant role in the observed
pressure time series in these experiments. We also found that pressures can
fall below vapor pressure due to the interaction of reflecting and diffracting
shock waves, suggesting that cavitation bubbles could be a damage mechanism.
Computations that include a simulated hydrophone inserted in the transwell
suggest that the instrument itself could significantly alter blast wave
properties. These findings illustrate the need for further computational

Neutrinos can be related to the spinons with respect to the electric-charge and
spin separation in the early universe or other circumstances. Some effective,

are derived and a phenomenological description for the chargon condensate is

in the chargon condensate, and spinon zero modes are trapped in the vortices,
forming spinon-vortex bound states. In cosmology this configuration may lead to

  Population Protocols",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we focus on a natural class of population protocols whose
dynamics are modelled by the discrete version of Lotka-Volterra equations. In
such protocols, when an agent $a$ of type (species) $i$ interacts with an agent
$b$ of type (species) $j$ with $a$ as the initiator, then $b$'s type becomes
$i$ with probability $P\_{ij}$. In such an interaction, we think of $a$ as the
predator, $b$ as the prey, and the type of the prey is either converted to that
of the predator or stays as is. Such protocols capture the dynamics of some
opinion spreading models and generalize the well-known Rock-Paper-Scissors
discrete dynamics. We consider the pairwise interactions among agents that are
scheduled uniformly at random. We start by considering the convergence time and
show that any Lotka-Volterra-type protocol on an $n$-agent population converges
to some absorbing state in time polynomial in $n$, w.h.p., when any pair of
agents is allowed to interact. By contrast, when the interaction graph is a
star, even the Rock-Paper-Scissors protocol requires exponential time to
converge. We then study threshold effects exhibited by Lotka-Volterra-type
protocols with 3 and more species under interactions between any pair of
agents. We start by presenting a simple 4-type protocol in which the
probability difference of reaching the two possible absorbing states is
strongly amplified by the ratio of the initial populations of the two other
types, which are transient, but ""control"" convergence. We then prove that the
Rock-Paper-Scissors protocol reaches each of its three possible absorbing
states with almost equal probability, starting from any configuration
satisfying some sub-linear lower bound on the initial size of each species.
That is, Rock-Paper-Scissors is a realization of a ""coin-flip consensus"" in a
distributed system. Some of our techniques may be of independent value.

application of certain mechanisms to meet the QoS requirements. Traditionally,
medium access control (MAC) and network layers perform these tasks. However,
these mechanisms do not take (fading) channel conditions into account. In this
paper, we investigate the problem using cross layer techniques where
information flow and joint optimization of higher and physical layer is
permitted. We propose a scheduling scheme to optimize the energy consumption of
a multiuser multi-access system such that QoS constraints in terms of packet
loss are fulfilled while the system is able to maximize the advantages emerging
from multiuser diversity. Specifically, this work focuses on modeling and
analyzing the effects of packet buffering capabilities of the transmitter on
the system energy for a packet loss tolerant application. We discuss low

The numerical evaluation reveals useful insights about the coupling effects of
different QoS parameters on the system energy consumption and validates our

enables the realization of high power amplifier (PA) efficiency. For CE
precoding in a single-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel, a
desired constellation is feasible at the receiver if and only if it can be
scaled to lie in an annulus, whose boundaries are characterized by the
instantaneous channel realization. Therefore, if a fixed receiver constellation
is used for CE precoding in a fading channel, where the annulus is
time-varying, there is in general a non-zero probability of encountering a
channel that makes CE precoding infeasible, thereby causing a high probability
of error. To tackle this problem, this paper studies the adaptive receiver
constellation design for CE precoding in a single-user MISO flat-fading channel
with an arbitrary number of antennas at the transmitter. We first investigate
the fixed-rate adaptive receiver constellation design to minimize the symbol
error rate (SER). Specifically, an efficient algorithm is proposed to find the
optimal amplitude-and-phase shift keying (APSK) constellation with two rings
that is both feasible and of the maximum minimum Euclidean distance (MED), for
any given constellation size and instantaneous channel realization. Numerical
results show that by using the optimized fixed-rate adaptive receiver
constellation, our proposed scheme achieves significantly improved SER
performance over CE precoding with a fixed receiver constellation. Furthermore,
based on the family of optimal fixed-rate adaptive two-ring APSK constellation
sets, a variable-rate CE transmission scheme is proposed and numerically
examined.

and \textsc{gemc}, a hybrid optimisation code combining MCMC and a genetic
algorithm. We then present high-precision photometry of four transits in the
WASP-6 planetary system, two of which contain a starspot anomaly. All four
transits were modelled using \textsc{prism} and \textsc{gemc}, and the physical
properties of the system calculated. We find the mass and radius of the host
star to be $0.836\pm 0.063\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and $0.864\pm0.024\,{\rm R}_\odot$,
respectively. For the planet we find a mass of $0.485\pm 0.027\,{\rm M}_{\rm
Jup}$, a radius of $1.230\pm0.035\,{\rm R}_{\rm Jup}$ and a density of
$0.244\pm0.014\,\rho_{\rm Jup}$. These values are consistent with those found
in the literature. In the likely hypothesis that the two spot anomalies are
caused by the same starspot or starspot complex, we measure the stars rotation
period and velocity to be $23.80 \pm 0.15$\,d and $1.78 \pm
0.20$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, respectively, at a co-latitude of 75.8$^\circ$. We find
that the sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary
orbital axis is $\lambda = 7.2^{\circ} \pm 3.7^{\circ}$, indicating axial
alignment. Our results are consistent with and more precise than published
spectroscopic measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. These results
suggest that WASP-6\,b formed at a much greater distance from its host star and
suffered orbital decay through tidal interactions with the protoplanetary disc.

computationally efficient simulations of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)

the weighting of tunneling matrix elements of different tip orbital characters
by an arbitrary energy independent choice or based on energy dependent
weighting coefficients obtained by an expansion of the tip single electron
wavefunctions/density of states projected onto the tip apex atom. Tip-orbital
interference in the STM junction is included in the model by construction and
can be analyzed quantitatively. As a further advantage, arbitrary tip
geometrical orientations are included in the revised model by rotating the
coordinate system of the tip apex using Euler angles and redefining the
weighting coefficients of the tunneling matrix elements. We demonstrate the
reliability of the model by applying it to two functionalized surfaces of
recent interest where quantum interference effects play an important role in
the STM imaging process: N-doped graphene and a magnetic Mn2H complex on the
Ag(111) surface. We find that the proposed tunneling model is 25 times faster
than the Bardeen method concerning computational time, while maintaining good
agreement. Our results show that the electronic structure of the tip has a
considerable effect on STM images, and the Tersoff-Hamann model does not always
provide sufficient results in view of quantum interference effects. For both
studied surfaces we highlight the importance of interference between s and pz

that no single isochrone can fit the entire upper main sequence at the

significance, to be younger than less massive stars. This discrepancy is
consistent with earlier studies, but vanishes when including stellar rotation.
The entire upper main sequence of both clusters is very well-fit by a
distribution of 800 Myr-old stars with the spectroscopically measured
[Fe/H]=0.12. The increase over the consensus age of ~600-650 Myr is due both to
the revised Solar metallicity (from $Z_\odot \approx 0.02$ to $Z_\odot \approx
0.014$) and to the lengthening of main sequence lifetimes and increase in
luminosities with rapid rotation. Our results show that rotation can remove the

non-evolution by examining a sample of 178 bright, M_UV < -21 galaxies at z=4
to 7, analyzing their stellar populations and host halo masses. Including deep
Spitzer/IRAC imaging to constrain the rest-frame optical light, we find that
M*_UV galaxies at z=4-7 have similar stellar masses of log(M/Msol)=9.6-9.9 and
are thus relatively massive for these high redshifts. However, bright galaxies
at z=4-7 are less massive and have younger inferred ages than similarly bright
galaxies at z=2-3, even though the two populations have similar star formation
rates and levels of dust attenuation. We match the abundances of these bright
z=4-7 galaxies to halo mass functions from the Bolshoi Lambda-CDM simulation to
estimate the halo masses. We find that the typical halo masses in ~M*_UV
galaxies decrease from log(M_h/Msol)=11.9 at z=4 to log(M_h/Msol)=11.4 at z=7.
Thus, although we are studying galaxies at a similar mass across multiple
redshifts, these galaxies live in lower mass halos at higher redshift. The
stellar baryon fraction in units of the cosmic mean Omega_b/Omega_m rises from
5.1% at z=4 to 11.7% at z=7; this evolution is significant at the ~3-sigma
level. This rise does not agree with simple expectations of how galaxies grow,
and implies that some effect, perhaps a diminishing efficiency of feedback, is
allowing a higher fraction of available baryons to be converted into stars at
high redshifts.

detailed stellar evolution calculations of extremely low mass (ELM) helium WDs
possessing hydrogen envelopes with the the orbital shrinking of the binary
driven by gravitational radiation. We show that the consideration of hydrogen
fusion in these systems is crucial, as a significant fraction ($\approx$50%) of
future donors are expected to still be burning when mass transfer commences. We
apply our method to two detached eclipsing DWD systems, SDSS J0651+2844 and
NLTT-11748, in order to demonstrate the effect that carbon-nitrogen-oxygen
(CNO) flashes have on constraining the evolutionary history of such systems. We
find that when CNO flashes are absent on the low mass WD ($M_{2}$ < $0.18
M_{\odot}$), such as in NLTT-11748, we are able to self consistently solve for
the donor conditions at CE detachment given a reliable cooling age from the
massive WD companion. When CNO flashes occur (0.18 $M_{\odot}$ < $M_{2}$ < 0.36
$M_{\odot}$), such as in SDSS J0651+2844, the evolutionary history is
eradicated and we are unable to comment on the detachment conditions. We find

evolution on the properties of streams as well as their observability. To this
end, we have performed a suite of numerical experiments for a host system that
doubles its mass during the integration time and for a variety of initial
conditions. In these experiments we found that the most striking imprint is a
misalignment of 10 degrees in the angular location of the apocentres of the
streams compared to the static case (and to the orbit of the centre of mass),
which only becomes apparent for sufficiently long streams. We have also
developed an analytic model using action-angle variables which allows us to
explain this behaviour and to identify the most important signature of time
evolution, namely a difference in the slope defined by the distribution of
particles along a stream in frequency and in angle space. Although a difference
in slope can arise when the present-day potential is not correctly modelled,
this shortcoming can be by-passed because in this case, streams are no longer
straight lines in angle space, but depict a wiggly appearance and an
implausible energy gradient. The difference in slope due to time-evolution is
small, typically $\sim10^{-2}$ and its amplitude depends on the growth rate of
the potential, but nonetheless we find that it could be observable if accurate
full-space information for nearby long streams is available.

long-slit case, we investigate the 2D kinematic behaviour in the edge-on
projection as a function of the boxy/peanut strength and position angle; we
find that for the strongest structures the highest moments show characteristic
features away from the midplane in a range of position angles. We also discuss
the masking effect of a classical bulge and the ambiguity in discriminating
kinematically this spherically-symmetric component from a boxy/peanut bulge
seen end-on. Regarding the face-on case, we extend existing results to
encompass the effect of a second buckling and find that this phenomenon spurs
an additional set of even deeper minima in the fourth moment. Finally, we show
how the results evolve when inclining the disk away from perfectly edge-on and
face-on. The behaviour of stars born during the course of the simulations is
discussed and confronted to that of the pre-existing disk. The general aim of

theoretical predictions for the SiIV_1400 and CIV_1550 UV indices; both are
comprised of a blend of stellar wind and interstellar lines and have been
proposed as metallicity diagnostics in the UV. Our models and observations both
demonstrate that there is a positive linear correlation with metallicity for
both indices, and we find generally good agreement between our observations and
the predictions of the Starburst99 models. By combining the rest-frame UV
observations with pre-existing rest-frame optical spectrophotometry of our blue
compact galaxy sample, we also directly compare the predictions of metallicity
and extinction diagnostics across both wavelength regimes. This comparison
reveals a correlation between the UV absorption and optical strong-line
diagnostics, offering the first means of directly comparing ISM properties
determined across different rest-frame regimes. Finally, using our Starburst99
model grid we determine theoretical values for the short-wavelength UV
continuum slope, $\beta_{18}$, that can be used for determining extinction in
rest-frame UV spectra of star-forming galaxies. We consider the implications of
these results and discuss future work aimed at parameterizing these and other
environmental diagnostics in the UV as well as the development of robust
comparisons between ISM diagnostics across a broad wavelength baseline.

quantum field theories, as well as the holographic bound on their entanglement
entropy, both leading to an IR cut-off that scales as the fifth power of the
highest UV scale (in Planck units). One may view this as analogous to the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which is imposed on the phase space of
gravitational theories by the Einstein constraint equations. The leading effect
on cosmological observables come from anisotropic vacuum stresses which imply:
i) any extension of the standard model of particle physics can only have masses
(or resonances) $\lesssim$ 24 TeV, and ii) perturbative quantum field theory or
quantum gravity becomes strongly coupled beyond a cut-off scale of
$\Lambda\lesssim1$ PeV. Such a low cut-off is independently motivated by the
Higgs hierarchy problem. This result, which we dub the cosmological
non-constant problem, can be viewed as an extension of the cosmological
constant (CC) problem, demonstrating the non-trivial UV-IR coupling and (yet
another) limitation of effective field theory in gravity. However, it is more
severe than the old CC problem, as vacuum fluctuations cannot be tuned to
cancel due to the positivity of spectral densities or entropy. We thus predict
that future advances in cosmological observations and collider technology will
sandwich from above and below, and eventually discover, new (non-perturbative)
physics beyond the Standard Model within the TeV-PeV energy range.

reports of zero energy modes in single particle tunneling density of states,
their identity as Majorana modes has so far not been unequivocally established.
We make predictions for the local compressibility $\kappa_{\rm{loc}}$, tuned by
changing the chemical potential $\mu$ in a semiconducting nanowire with strong
spin-orbit coupling and in a Zeeman field in proximity to a superconductor,

show that in the center of the wire, the topological phase transition is
signaled by a divergence of $\kappa_{\rm{loc}}$ as a function of $\mu$ which is
an important diagnostic of the topological phase transition. We also find that
a single strong impurity potential can lead to a local {\it negative}
compressibility at the topological phase transition. The origin of such
anomalous behavior can be traced to the formation of Andreev bound states close
to topological phase transitions. Measurable by a scanning electron transistor,
the compressibility includes contributions from both single particle states and
collective modes and is therefore a complimentary probe from scanning tunneling
spectroscopy.

helium-accreting sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs in the double-degenerate
and the double-detonation channels, respectively, as the most promising
progenitors of normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Thus the fate of
rapidly-accreting Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate
channel remains more mysterious then ever. In this paper, we clarify the nature
of ignition in Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate SNe Ia by analytically
deriving the existence of a characteristic length scale which establishes a
transition from central ignitions to buoyancy-driven ignitions. Using this
criterion, combined with data from three-dimensional simulations of convection
and ignition, we demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of ignition events
within Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate channel are
buoyancy-driven, and consequently lack a vigorous deflagration phase. We thus
infer that single-degenerate SNe Ia are generally expected to lead to
overluminous 1991T-like SNe Ia events. We establish that the rates predicted
from both the population of supersoft X-ray sources and binary population
synthesis models of the single-degenerate channel are broadly consistent with
the observed rates of overluminous SNe Ia, and suggest that the population of
supersoft X-ray sources are the dominant stellar progenitors of SNe 1991T-like
events. We further demonstrate that the single-degenerate channel contribution
to the normal and failed 2002cx-like rates is not likely to exceed 1% of the
total SNe Ia rate. We conclude with a range of observational tests of
overluminous SNe Ia which will either support or strongly constrain the
single-degenerate scenario.

crucial problem in the era of GAIA and LSST since the sheer volume of

nonparametric classifier that uses the transient's light curve measurements to
predict its class given training data. It implements two novel components: the
first is the use of the BAGIDIS wavelet methodology - a characterization of
functional data using hierarchical wavelet coefficients. The second novelty is
the introduction of a ranked probability classifier on the wavelet coefficients
that handles both the heteroscedasticity of the data in addition to the
potential non-representativity of the training set. The ranked classifier is
simple and quick to implement while a major advantage of the BAGIDIS wavelets
is that they are translation invariant, hence they do not need the light curves
to be aligned to extract features. Further, BAGIDIS is nonparametric so it can
be used for blind searches for new objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our ranked wavelet classifier against the well-tested Supernova Photometric
Classification Challenge dataset in which the challenge is to correctly
classify light curves as Type Ia or non-Ia supernovae. We train our ranked
probability classifier on the spectroscopically-confirmed subsample (which is
not representative) and show that it gives good results for all supernova with
observed light curve timespans greater than 100 days (roughly 55% of the
dataset). For such data, we obtain a Ia efficiency of 80.5% and a purity of
82.4% yielding a highly competitive score of 0.49 whilst implementing a truly
""model-blind"" approach to supernova classification. Consequently this approach
may be particularly suitable for the classification of astronomical transients
in the era of large synoptic sky surveys.

uniform or 2D Gaussians on the sky with transverse linear gradients in rotation

high frequencies the spectra of all these models can be approximated by the
spectrum of a Gaussian source; this is independent of whether the magnetic

is not a unique signature of a volume where synchrotron emission and Faraday
rotation are mixed. A turbulent Faraday screen with a large field coherence
length produces a spectrum which is similar to the spectrum of a partial
coverage model. At low and intermediate frequencies, such a Faraday screen
produces a significantly higher polarized signal than the depolarization model
by Burn, as shown by a random walk model of the polarization vectors. We
calculate RM spectra for four frequency windows. Sources are strongly
depolarized at low frequencies, but RMs can be determined accurately if the
sensitivity of the observations is sufficient. Finally, we show that RM spectra
can be used to differentiate between turbulent foreground models and partial

galaxies obtain their gas, but also by internal processes in the galaxy, such
as star formation and feedback from stars and the BH itself. In this paper, we
study the growth of a 10^12 Msun halo at z=2, which is the progenitor of al
group of galaxies at z=0, and of its central BH by means of a high-resolution
zoomed cosmological simulation, the Seth simulation. We study the evolution of
the BH driven by the accretion of cold gas in the galaxy, and explore the
efficiency of the feedback from supernovae (SNe). For a relatively inefficient
energy input from SNe, the BH grows at the Eddington rate from early times, and
reaches self-regulation once it is massive enough. We find that at early cosmic
times z>3.5, efficient feedback from SNe forbids the formation of a settled
disc as well as the accumulation of dense cold gas in the vicinity of the BH
and starves the central compact object. As the galaxy and its halo accumulate
mass, they become able to confine the nuclear inflows provided by major mergers
and the BH grows at a sustained near-to-Eddington accretion rate. We argue that
this mechanism should be ubiquitous amongst low-mass galaxies, corresponding to
galaxies with a stellar mass below <10^9 Msun in our simulations.

To investigate to what extent similar evolution is seen in other NS-LMXBs we
have performed a detailed study of the color-color and hardness-intensity
diagrams (CDs and HIDs) of Cyg X-2, Cir X-1, and GX 13+1 -- three luminous
X-ray binaries, containing weakly magnetized neutron stars, known to exhibit
strong secular changes in their CD/HID tracks. Using the full set of Rossi

display CD/HID evolution with close similarities to XTE J1701-462. Although GX

to XTE J1701-462, and we conclude that its overall CD/HID properties strongly

source. We conjecture that the secular evolution of Cyg X-2, Cir X-1, and GX

changes in the mass accretion rate. Our results strengthen previous suggestions
that within single sources Cyg-like Z source behavior takes place at higher

support to the notion that the mass accretion rate is the primary physical
parameter distinguishing the various NS-LMXB subclasses.

observations of Holmberg II X-1 above 10 keV, and reveal a very steep
high-energy spectrum, similar to other ULXs observed by NuSTAR to date. These
observations further demonstrate that ULXs exhibit spectral states that are not
typically seen in Galactic black hole binaries. Comparison with other sources
implies that Holmberg II X-1 accretes at a high fraction of its Eddington
accretion rate, and possibly exceeds it. The soft X-ray spectrum (E<10 keV)
appears to be dominated by two blackbody-like emission components, the hotter
of which may be associated with an accretion disk. However, all simple disk
models under-predict the NuSTAR data above ~10 keV and require an additional
emission component at the highest energies probed, implying the NuSTAR data
does not fall away with a Wien spectrum. We investigate physical origins for
such an additional high-energy emission component, and favor a scenario in
which the excess arises from Compton scattering in a hot corona of electrons

simplification of complex data. However, it is computationally intractable for

the scale of interest so as to create a topological microscopy for the
underlying data. We utilize flexibility-rigidity index (FRI) to access the
topological connectivity of the data set and define a rigidity density for the
filtration analysis. By appropriately tuning the resolution, we are able to
focus the topological lens on a desirable scale. The proposed multiresolution
topological analysis is validated by a hexagonal fractal image which has three
distinct scales. We further demonstrate the proposed method for extracting
topological fingerprints from DNA and RNA molecules. In particular, the
topological persistence of a virus capsid with 240 protein monomers is
successfully analyzed which would otherwise be inaccessible to the normal point
cloud method and unreliable by using coarse-grained multiscale persistent
homology. The proposed method has also been successfully applied to the protein
domain classification, which is the first time that persistent homology is used
for practical protein domain analysis, to our knowledge. The proposed
multiresolution topological method has potential applications in arbitrary data

advances such as weak memory architectures greatly compound this problem. This
has renewed interest in partial order semantics as a theoretical foundation for

shown to be particularly effective at finding concurrency-related bugs because
they can leverage highly optimized decision procedures such as SAT/SMT solvers.
This paper gives new fundamental results on partial order semantics for
SAT/SMT-based symbolic encodings of weak memory concurrency. In particular, we
give the theoretical basis for a decision procedure that can handle a fragment

we show that a certain partial order semantics of relaxed sequential
consistency is equivalent to the conjunction of three extensively studied weak

an asymptotically smaller symbolic encoding for bounded model checking which
has only a quadratic number of partial order constraints compared to the

the objective of precisely approximating its state probability distribution in

arbitrary finite partition of the state space of the Markov process, and the
computation of average transition probabilities between partition sets. The
abstraction technique is formal, in that it comes with guarantees on the
introduced approximation that depend on the diameters of the partitions: as
such, they can be tuned at will. Further in the case of Markov processes with
unbounded state spaces, a procedure for precisely truncating the state space
within a compact set is provided, together with an error bound that depends on
the asymptotic properties of the transition kernel of the original process. The
overall abstraction algorithm, which practically hinges on piecewise constant
approximations of the density functions of the Markov process, is extended to
higher-order function approximations: these can lead to improved error bounds

tested to compute probabilistic invariance of the Markov process under study,

a combinatorial perspective. We show that the TIN power control problem can be
cast into an assignment problem, such that the globally optimal power
allocation variables can be obtained by well-known polynomial time algorithms.
Furthermore, the expression of the TIN-Achievable GDoF region (TINA region) can
be substantially simplified with the aid of maximum weighted matchings. We also
provide conditions under which the TINA region is a convex polytope that relax
those in [3]. For these new conditions, together with a channel connectivity
(i.e., interference topology) condition, we show TIN optimality for a new class
of interference networks that is not included, nor includes, the class found in

scheduling and power control in wireless networks, which has been widely
studied as a basic physical layer mechanism for device-to-device (D2D)
communications. Inspired by the relaxed TIN channel strength condition as well
as the assignment-based power allocation, we propose a low-complexity

the heuristic approach known as FlashLinQ. It is demonstrated by simulation
that ITLinQ+ provides significant average network throughput gains over both
ITLinQ and FlashLinQ, and yet still maintains the same level of implementation
complexity. More notably, the energy efficiency of the newly proposed ITLinQ+
is substantially larger than that of ITLinQ and FlashLinQ, which is desirable

solution represents the atom dislocation in a crystal. The equation that we
consider comprises the classical Peierls-Nabarro model as a particular case,
and it allows also long range interactions.
  It is known that the dislocation function of such a model has the tendency to
concentrate at single points, which evolve in time according to the external
stress and a singular, long range potential.
  Depending on the orientation of the dislocation function at these points, the
potential may be either attractive or repulsive, hence collisions may occur in
the latter case and, at the collision time, the dislocation function does not
disappear.
  The goal of this paper is to provide accurate estimates on the relaxation
times of the system after collision. More precisely, we take into account the
case of two and three colliding points, and we show that, after a small
transition time subsequent to the collision, the dislocation function relaxes
exponentially fast to a steady state.
  We stress that the exponential decay is somehow exceptional in nonlocal
problems (for instance, the spatial decay in this case is polynomial). The
exponential time decay is due to the coupling (in a suitable space/time scale)
between the evolution term and the potential induced by the periodicity of the
crystal.

model can describe the image, including objects, attributes and their

convergence, runtime and success of annealing algorithms. This article outlines
a unifying framework, ensemble annealing, that combines ideas from simulated
annealing, histogram reweighting and nested sampling with concepts in
thermodynamic control. Ensemble annealing simultaneously simulates a physical
system and estimates its density of states. The temperatures are lowered not
according to a prefixed schedule but adaptively so as to maintain a constant
relative entropy between successive ensembles. After each step on the
temperature ladder an estimate of the density of states is updated and a new
temperature is chosen. Ensemble annealing is highly practical and broadly
applicable. This is illustrated for various systems including Ising, Potts, and
protein models.

uncertainty in power system operation will grow. This has implications for
tools such as Optimal Power Flow (OPF), an optimization problem widely used in
power system operations and planning, which should be adjusted to account for
this uncertainty. One way to handle the uncertainty is to formulate a Chance
Constrained OPF (CC-OPF) which limits the probability of constraint violation
to a predefined value. However, existing CC-OPF formulations and solutions are
not immune to drawbacks. On one hand, they only consider affine policies for
generation control, which are not always realistic and may be sub-optimal. On
the other hand, the standard CC-OPF formulations do not distinguish between
large and small violations, although those might carry significantly different
risk. In this paper, we introduce the Weighted CC-OPF (WCC-OPF) that can handle
general control policies while preserving convexity and allowing for efficient
computation. The weighted chance constraints account for the size of violations
through a weighting function, which assigns a higher risk to a higher
overloads. We prove that the problem remains convex for any convex weighting
function, and for very general generation control policies. In a case study, we
compare the performance of the new WCC-OPF and the standard CC-OPF and
demonstrate that WCC-OPF effectively reduces the number of severe overloads.
Furthermore, we compare an affine generation control policy with a more general
policy, and show that the additional flexibility allow for a lower cost while
maintaining the same level of risk.

rarely been probed before. Remarkably, we find that a single log-linear

over a wide range of luminosity (10$^{42}$<$L_{5100}$<10$^{47}$ergs/s) or

scaling relations are found between the optical and the UV continuum
luminosities or line widths. Applying the scaling relations to the H$\beta$

distributions of transition disks have been interpreted as evidence of embedded
massive protoplanets. However, comparing the predictions of planet-disk
interaction models to the observed features has shown far from perfect
agreement. This may be due to the strong approximations used for the
predictions. For example, spiral arm fitting typically uses results that are
based on low-mass planets in an isothermal gas. In this work, we describe
two-dimensional, global, hydrodynamical simulations of disks with embedded
protoplanets, with and without the assumption of local isothermality, for a
range of planet-to-star mass ratios 1-10 M_jup for a 1 M_sun star. We use the
Pencil Code in polar coordinates for our models. We find that the inner and
outer spiral wakes of massive protoplanets (M>5 M_jup) produce significant
shock heating that can trigger buoyant instabilities. These drive sustained
turbulence throughout the disk when they occur. The strength of this effect
depends strongly on the mass of the planet and the thermal relaxation
timescale; for a 10 M_jup planet embedded in a thin, purely adiabatic disk, the
spirals, gaps, and vortices typically associated with planet-disk interactions
are disrupted. We find that the effect is only weakly dependent on the initial
radial temperature profile. The spirals that form in disks heated by the
effects we have described may fit the spiral structures observed in transition
disks better than the spirals predicted by linear isothermal theory.

sciences particularly in clinical trials, epidemiology, health-economics,
surveys and many others since they allow generalization of inference to the
entire population under study. For count data, standard procedures such as the
Poisson regression and negative binomial model provide population average
inference for model parameters. However, occurrence of excess zero counts and
lack of independence in empirical data have necessitated their extension to
accommodate these phenomena. These extensions, though useful, complicates
interpretations of effects. For example, the zero-inflated Poisson model
accounts for the presence of excess zeros but the parameter estimates do not
have a direct marginal inferential ability as its base model, the Poisson
model. Marginalizations due to the presence of excess zeros are underdeveloped
though demand for such is interestingly high. The aim of this paper is to
develop a marginalized model for zero-inflated univariate count outcome in the
presence of overdispersion. Emphasis is placed on methodological development,
efficient estimation of model parameters, implementation and application to two
empirical studies. A simulation study is performed to assess the performance of
the model. Results from the analysis of two case studies indicated that the
refined procedure performs significantly better than models which do not
simultaneously correct for overdispersion and presence of excess zero counts in
terms of likelihood comparisons and AIC values. The simulation studies also
supported these findings. In addition, the proposed technique yielded small
biases and mean square errors for model parameters. To ensure that the proposed
method enjoys widespread use, it is implemented using the SAS NLMIXED procedure
with minimal coding efforts.

(Sr$_{n+1}$Ir$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$, where $n=1$, 2, and $\infty$) was considered
using muon spin spectroscopy ($\mu$SR). When probed by muons in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$
and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ ($n=1,2$), the internal field ($B_{\rm loc}$) showed
clear sign of a magnetic order in two stages at transition temperatures $T_{\rm
N}\simeq 230$ K and $T_{\rm m}\simeq 90$ K in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and $T_{\rm
N}\simeq 280$ K and $T_{\rm m}\simeq 70$ K in Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$, respectively.
In contrast, no long-range magnetic order was observed in orthorhombic
SrIrO$_3$ ($n=\infty$). Based on the known magnetic structure in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$
and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$, we successfully identified muon sites in these compounds
from the magnitude of $B_{\rm loc}$ in the first stage ($T_{\rm m}\le T\le
T_{\rm N}$). Below $T_{\rm m}$, $B_{\rm loc}$ probed by a fraction of muons
occupying sites near the apical oxygen of IrO$_6$ octahedra exhibited a further
increase but remained mostly unchanged for sites close to the in-plane oxygen.
While such behavior cannot be explained by the alteration of the Ir spin
structure, it is consistent with the selective appearance of ordered magnetic
moments on the apical oxygen. The oxygen polarization was also in line with the
reported magnetization anomalies in these compounds below $\sim T_{\rm m}$. A
possible link between the oxygen polarization and ferroelectric (multiferroic)
behavior in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ was considered.

with the peak separation of the order of $100$-$1000$ seconds which is
comparable to the periods of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar and stellar

function of flare energy ($E$) shows the power-law distribution ($dN/dE \propto
E^{-\alpha}$) with $\alpha \sim -1.5$ for $10^{33}<E<10^{36}$ erg which is
consistent with the previous results. The average occurrence rate of
superflares with the energy of $10^{33}$ erg which is equivalent to X100 solar

superflares is basically comparable to a fraction of the magnetic energy stored

duration of superflares ($\tau$) increases with the flare energy ($E$) as $\tau
\propto E^{0.39\pm 0.03}$. This can be explained if we assume the time-scale of

combine observations from the SLUGGS and Atlas3D surveys to map out the stellar
kinematics in two-dimensions, out to a median radius for the sample of four
half-light radii $R_e$ (or 10 kpc), and a maximum radius of 2.0-6.2 $R_e$ (or
4-21 kpc). We use axisymmetric dynamical models based on the Jeans equations,
which allow for a spatially varying anisotropy, and employ quite general
profiles for the dark halos, and in particular do not place any restriction on
the profile slope. This is made possible by the availability of spatially
extended two-dimensional kinematics. We find that our relatively simple models
provide a remarkably good description of the observed kinematics. The resulting
total density profiles are well described by a nearly-isothermal power law
$\rho_{\rm tot}(r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$ from $R_e$/10 to at least 4$R_e$, the
largest average deviation being 11%. The average logarithmic slope is
$\langle\gamma\rangle=2.19\pm0.03$ with observed rms scatter of just
$\sigma_\gamma=0.11$. This scatter out to large radii, where dark matter
dominates, is as small as previously reported by lensing studies around
$r\approx R_e/2$, where the stars dominate. Our bulge-halo conspiracy places
much tighter constraints on galaxy formation models. It illustrates the power
of two-dimensional stellar kinematics observations at large radii. It would now
be important to test the generality of our results for different galaxy types

chance-constrained convex programs utilizes random sampling on the uncertainty
parameter to substitute the original problem with a representative continuous
convex optimization with $N$ convex constraints which is a relaxation of the
original. Calafiore and Campi provided an explicit estimate on the size $N$ of
the sampling relaxation to yield high-likelihood feasible solutions of the
chance-constrained problem. They measured the probability of the original
constraints to be violated by the random optimal solution from the relaxation
of size $N$.
  This paper has two main contributions. First, we present a generalization of
the Calafiore-Campi results to both integer and mixed-integer variables. In
fact, we demonstrate that their sampling estimates work naturally for variables
restricted to some subset $S$ of $\mathbb R^d$. The key elements are
generalizations of Helly's theorem where the convex sets are required to
intersect $S \subset \mathbb R^d$. The size of samples in both algorithms will
be directly determined by the $S$-Helly numbers.
  Motivated by the first half of the paper, for any subset $S \subset \mathbb
R^d$, we introduce the notion of an $S$-optimization problem, where the
variables take on values over $S$. It generalizes continuous, integer, and
mixed-integer optimization. We illustrate with examples the expressive power of
$S$-optimization to capture sophisticated combinatorial optimization problems
with difficult modular constraints. We reinforce the evidence that
$S$-optimization is ""the right concept"" by showing that the well-known
randomized sampling algorithm of K. Clarkson for low-dimensional convex
optimization problems can be extended to work with variables taking values over
$S$.

provides a narrow channel for the efficient transportation of gas and matter
particles from the surroundings into the void galaxies. Analyzing the Sloan
void catalog constructed by Pan et al (2012), we identify the filamentary
structures in void regions and determine the specific size of each void
filament as a measure of its straightness. To avoid possible spurious signals
caused by the Malmquist bias, we consider only those void filaments whose
redshifts are in the range of 0=< z <= 0.02 and find a clear tendency that the
void galaxies located in the more straight filaments are on average more
luminous, which is in qualitative agreement with the numerical prediction. It
is also shown that the strength of correlation increases with the number of the
member galaxies of the void filaments, which can be physically understood on
the grounds that the more stretched filaments can connect the dense
surroundings even to the galaxies located deep in the central parts of the
voids. This observational evidence may provide a key clue to the puzzling issue
of why the void galaxies have higher specific star formation rates and bluer
colors than their wall counterparts.

solution of a parabolic linear mesh generator to find the location of an
adaptive mesh along the (artificial) subdomain interfaces. The deterministic
evaluation of the mesh over each subdomain can then be obtained completely
independently using the probabilistically computed solutions as boundary

Landau damping is shown to be governed by Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), modified KdV

group I (flaring disk) and II (at disk) sources. We find that group I sources
tend to show more extended emission than group II sources. Previous studies
have shown that the continuous disk is hard to be resolved with 8 meter class
telescopes in Q-band due to the strong emission from the unresolved innermost
region of the disk. It indicates that the resolved Q-band sources require a
hole or gap in the disk material distribution to suppress the contribution from
the innermost region of the disk. As many group I sources are resolved at 25
\mu m, we suggest that many, not all, group I Herbig Ae/Be disks have a hole or
gap and are (pre-)transitional disks. On the other hand, the unresolved nature
of many group II sources at 25 \mu m supports that group II disks have
continuous at disk geometry. It has been inferred that group I disks may evolve
into group II through settling of dust grains to the mid-plane of the
proto-planetary disk. However, considering growing evidence for the presence of
a hole or gaps in the disk of group I sources, such an evolutionary scenario is
unlikely. The difference between groups I and II may reflect different

methods of 3D surface morphing by deformable modeling and conformal mapping are
shown in this study. It is well known that there exists a unique Riemann
conformal mapping from a simply connected surface into a unit disk by the
Riemann mapping theorem. The dilation and relative orientations of the 3D
surfaces can be linked through the M\""obius transformation due to the conformal
characteristic of the Riemann mapping. On the other hand, a 3D surface
deformable model can be built via various approaches such as mutual
parameterization from direct interpolation or surface matching using landmarks.
In this paper, we take the advantage of the unique representation of 3D
surfaces by the mean curvatures and the conformal factors associated with the
Riemann mapping. By registering the landmarks on the conformal parametric
domains, the correspondence of the mean curvatures and the conformal factors
for each surfaces can be obtained. As a result, we can construct the 3D
deformation field from the surface reconstruction algorithm proposed by Gu and
Yau. Furthermore, by composition of the M\""obius transformation and the 3D
deformation field, the morphing sequence can be generated from the mean
curvatures and the conformal factors on a unified mesh structure by using the
cubic spline homotopy. Several numerical experiments of the face morphing are
presented to demonstrate the robustness of our approach.

flocs. In sharp contrast to the biofilm-mediated streamers, these streamers
form over extremely small timescales (less than a second). Our experiments,
carried out in a microchannel with micropillars rely on fluorescence microscopy
techniques to illustrate that floc-mediated streamers form when a freely-moving
floc adheres to the micropillar wall and gets rapidly sheared by the background
flow. We also show that at their inception the deformation of the flocs is
dominated by recoverable large strains indicating significant elasticity. These
strains subsequently increase tremendously to produce filamentous streamers.
Interestingly, we find that these fully formed streamers are not static

time scales. Finally we show that such novel streamer formation can lead to
rapid clogging of microfluidic devices.

assuming that the leading mechanism for the neutrino production is
lepto-hadronic. To this purpose, we include hadronic, radiative and adiabatic
cooling effects and discuss their relevance for long- (including high- and

background is derived, by requiring that the GRB high-energy neutrino
counterparts follow up-to-date gamma-ray luminosity functions and redshift
evolutions of the long and short GRBs. Although dedicated stacking searches
have been unsuccessful up to now, we find that GRBs could contribute up to a
few % to the observed IceCube high-energy neutrino flux for sub-PeV energies,
assuming that the latter has a diffuse origin. Gamma-ray bursts, especially
low-luminosity ones, could however be the main sources of the IceCube
high-energy neutrino flux in the PeV range. While high-luminosity and
low-luminosity GRBs have comparable intensities, the contribution from the

finite quark chemical potential $\mu/T\lesssim1.2$ by using the
non-perturbatively $O(a)$ improved Wilson fermion action on lattices with a
fixed temporal extent $N_{\rm t}=6$ and varied spatial linear extents $N_{\rm

characterizes the phase structure, and extracting the curvature of the critical
line on the $\mu$-$m_{\pi}$ plane. For Wilson-type fermions, the correspondence
between bare parameters and physical parameters is indirect. Hence we present a
strategy to transfer the bare parameter phase structure to the physical one, in
order to obtain the curvature. Our conclusion is that the curvature is
positive. This implies that, if one starts from a quark mass in the region of
crossover at zero chemical potential, one would encounter a first-order phase
transition when one raises the chemical potential.

plasticity, driven by underlying genetic and epigenetic perturbations. However,
at a systems-level it is unclear how these perturbations give rise to the
observed increased plasticity. Elucidating such systems-level principles is key
for an improved understanding of cancer. Recently, it has been shown that
signaling entropy, an overall measure of signaling pathway promiscuity, and
computable from integrating a sample's gene expression profile with a protein
interaction network, correlates with phenotypic plasticity and is increased in
cancer compared to normal tissue. Here we develop a computational framework for
studying the effects of network perturbations on signaling entropy. We
demonstrate that the increased signaling entropy of cancer is driven by two
factors: (i) the scale-free (or near scale-free) topology of the interaction
network, and (ii) a subtle positive correlation between differential gene
expression and node connectivity. Indeed, we show that if protein interaction
networks were random graphs, described by Poisson degree distributions, that
cancer would generally not exhibit an increased signaling entropy. In summary,
this work exposes a deep connection between cancer, signaling entropy and
interaction network topology.

The results of our modeling suggest a decomposition of phosphorene into weakly
bonded one-dimensional (1D) chains upon single- and double-side hydrogenation
and fluorination. In spite of a sizable quasiparticle band gap (2.29 eV), fully
hydrogenated phosphorene found to be dynamically unstable. In contrast, full
fluorination of phosphorene gives rise to a stable structure, being an indirect
gap semiconductor with the band gap of 2.27 eV. We also show that fluorination
of phosphorene from the gas phase is significantly more likely than
hydrogenation due to the relatively low energy barrier for the dissociative
adsorption of F2 (0.19 eV) compared to H2 (2.54 eV). At low concentrations,
monovalent impurities tend to form regular atomic rows phosphorene, though such
patterns do not seem to be easily achievable due to high migration barriers
(1.09 and 2.81 eV for H2 and F2, respectively). Oxidation of phosphorene is
shown to be a qualitatively different process. Particularly, we observe
instability of phosphorene upon oxidation, leading to the formation of
disordered amorphous-like structures at high concentrations of impurities.

states at the Fermi level. The small band overlaps and multi-band effects give
rise to many novel electronic properties, such as relativistic Dirac fermions
with linear dispersion, titanic magnetoresistance and unconventional
superconductivity. Black phosphorus has recently emerged as an exceptional
semiconductor with high carrier mobility and a direct, tunable bandgap. Of
particular importance is the search for exotic electronic states in black
phosphorus, which may amplify the material's potential beyond semiconductor
devices. Here we show that a moderate hydrostatic pressure effectively
suppresses the band gap and induces a Lifshitz transition from semiconductor to
semimetal in black phosphorus; a colossal magnetoresistance is observed in the
semimetallic phase. Quantum oscillations in high magnetic field reveal the
complex Fermi surface topology of the semimetallic black phosphorus. In
particular, a Dirac-like fermion emerges at around 1.2 GPa, which is
continuously tuned by external pressure. The observed semi-metallic behavior
greatly enriches black phosphorus's material property, and sets the stage for
the exploration of novel electronic states in this material. Moreover, these
interesting behaviors make phosphorene a good candidate for the realization of
a new two-dimensional relativistic electron system, other than graphene.

intensively using single-cell experiments. In metabolism heterogeneity may be
particularly important because it may affect synchronisation of metabolic
oscillations, an important example of cell-cell communication. This
synchronisation is notoriously difficult to describe theoretically as the
example of glycolytic oscillations shows: neither is the mechanism of
glycolytic synchronisation understood nor the role of cell-cell heterogeneity.
To pin down the mechanism and to assess its robustness and universality we have
experimentally investigated the entrainment of glycolytic oscillations in
individual yeast cells by periodic external perturbations. We find that
oscillatory cells synchronise through phase shifts and that the mechanism is
insensitive to cell heterogeneity (robustness) and similar for different types

oscillations on the ion cyclotron waves in the solar wind. We proceed from the
assumption that the ion cyclotron waves in solar wind are experiencing
modulation with a characteristic period of 5 minutes under the influence of
Alfven waves driven by photospheric motions. The theory presented in our paper
predicts a deep frequency modulation of the ion cyclotron waves. The frequency
modulation is expected mainly from variations in orientation of the IMF lines.
In turn, the variations in orientation are caused by the Alfven waves,
propagating from the Sun. To test the theoretical predictions we have analyzed
records of the ultra-low-frequency (ULF) geoelectromagnetic waves in order to
find the permanent quasi-monochromatic oscillations of natural origin in the
Pc1-2 frequency band (0.1-5 Hz), the carrier frequency of which varies with
time in a wide range. As a result we found the so-called ""serpentine emission""
(SE), which was observed in Antarctic at the Vostok station near the South
Geomagnetic Pole. The permanency, range of frequencies, and the deep frequency
modulation of SE correspond to the qualitative properties of ion cyclotron
waves in the solar wind. Clearly expressed 5-minute modulation of the carrier
frequency is particularly important feature of the SE in the context of this
work. We believe that we have found non-trivial manifestation of the solar
5-min oscillations on the Earth.

The resulting dynamics are highly diverse, lead to local calcium ""puffs"" as

predominantly focused on stochastic channel models coupled to deterministic

Tracking of individual ions is computationally difficult due to the scale
separation in the Ca$^{2+}$ concentration when channels are in the open or
closed states. In this paper, a spatial multiscale model for investigating of
the dynamics of puffs is presented. It couples Brownian motion (diffusion) of
ions with a stochastic channel gating model. The model is used to analyze
calcium puff statistics. Concentration time traces as well as channel state
information are studied. We identify the regime in which puffs can be found and
develop a mean-field theory to extract the boundary of this regime. Puffs are

Mignon and Ressayre in 2004. Inspired by their proof method, we introduce a
natural rank concept of polynomials, called the bi-polynomial rank. The
bi-polynomial rank is related to width of an arithmetic branching program. The
bi-polynomial rank of a homogeneous polynomial p of even degree 2k is defined
as the minimum n such that p can be written as a summation of n products of
polynomials of degree k. We prove that the bi-polynomial rank gives a lower
bound of the determinantal complexity. As a consequence, the above Mignon and
Ressayre bound is improved to (d-1)^2 + 1 over the field of reals. We show that
the computation of the bi-polynomial rank is formulated as a rank minimization
problem. Applying the concave minimization technique, we reduce the problem of
lower-bounding determinantal complexity to that of proving the positive
semidefiniteness of matrices, and this is a new approach for the permanent vs.
determinant problem. We propose a computational approach for giving a lower

allows one to justify the vanishing viscosity and surface tension limits by the

the mean curvature of the free surface and the pressure. It seems hard to
overcome this difficulty by using the vorticity in viscous boundary layers. One

the bulk transition temperature. There is a second transition at a lower
temperature, however, below which the system spontaneously breaks time-reversal
symmetry. The surface bands are shifted away from zero energy and become weakly
dispersive. Simultaneously, a spin polarization and an equilibrium charge
current develop in the surface region.

composed of many interacting subunits; especially in neuroscience, network
graphs are increasingly used to represent and analyze functional interactions
between neural sources. Interactions are often reconstructed using pairwise
bivariate analyses, overlooking their multivariate nature: it is neglected that
investigating the effect of one source on a target necessitates to take all
other sources as potential nuisance variables into account; also combinations
of sources may act jointly on a given target. Bivariate analyses produce
networks that may contain spurious interactions, which reduce the
interpretability of the network and its graph metrics. A truly multivariate
reconstruction, however, is computationally intractable due to combinatorial
explosion in the number of potential interactions. Thus, we have to resort to
approximative methods to handle the intractability of multivariate interaction
reconstruction, and thereby enable the use of networks in neuroscience. Here,
we suggest such an approximative approach in the form of an algorithm that
extends fast bivariate interaction reconstruction by identifying potentially
spurious interactions post-hoc: the algorithm flags potentially spurious edges,
which may then be pruned from the network. This produces a statistically
conservative network approximation that is guaranteed to contain non-spurious
interactions only. We describe the algorithm and present a reference
implementation to test its performance. We discuss the algorithm in relation to
other approximative multivariate methods and highlight suitable application
scenarios. Our approach is a tractable and data-efficient way of reconstructing
approximative networks of multivariate interactions. It is preferable if
available data are limited or if fully multivariate approaches are
computationally infeasible.

complex and weak. Current Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) studies of cool star
magnetic fields chiefly employ circular polarization observations because
linear polarization is difficult to detect and requires a more sophisticated
radiative transfer modeling to interpret. But it has been shown in previous
theoretical studies, and in the observational analyses of magnetic Ap stars,
that including linear polarization in the magnetic inversion process makes it
possible to correctly recover many otherwise lost or misinterpreted magnetic
features. We have obtained phase-resolved observations in all four Stokes
parameters of the RS CVn star II Peg at two separate epochs. Here we present
temperature and magnetic field maps reconstructed for this star using all four
Stokes parameters. This is the very first such ZDI study of a cool active star.
Our magnetic inversions reveal a highly structured magnetic field topology for
both epochs. The strength of some surface features is doubled or even
quadrupled when linear polarization is taken into account. The total magnetic
energy of the reconstructed field map also becomes about 2.1-3.5 times higher.
The overall complexity is also increased as the field energy is shifted towards
higher harmonic modes when four Stokes parameters are used. As a consequence,
the potential field extrapolation of the four Stokes parameter ZDI results
indicates that magnetic field becomes weaker at a distance of several stellar
radii due to a decrease of the large-scale field component.

cosmic ray (GCR) intensity, solar wind velocity, and interplanetary magnetic
field (IMF) components in the recent prolonged solar minimum 23 24. The time
evolution of the quasi-periodicity in these parameters connected with the Suns
rotation reveals that their synodic period is stable and is aprox 26-27 days.
This means that the changes in the solar wind speed and IMF are related to the
Suns near equatorial regions in considering the differential rotation of the
Sun. However, the solar wind parameters observed near the Earths orbit provide
only the conditions in the limited local vicinity of the equatorial region in
the heliosphere (within in latitude). We also demonstrate that the observed
period of the GCR intensity connected with the Suns rotation increased up to
aprox 33-36 days in 2009. This means that the process driving the 27-day
variations of the GCR intensity takes place not only in the limited local
surroundings of the equatorial region but in the global 3-D space of the
heliosphere, covering also higher latitude regions. A relatively long period (
aprox 34 days) found for 2009 in the GCR intensity gives possible evidence of
the onset of cycle 24 due to active regions at higher latitudes and rotating
slowly because of the Suns differential rotation. We also discuss the effect of
differential rotation on the theoretical model of the 27-day variations of the
GCR intensity.

Johnson-Koplik-Dashen (JKD). Some of the coefficients in the Biot-JKD model are
proportional to the square root of the frequency. In the time-domain, these
coefficients introduce shifted fractional derivatives of order 1/2, involving a
convolution product. Based on a diffusive representation, the convolution
kernel is replaced by a finite number of memory variables that satisfy
local-in-time ordinary differential equations, resulting in the Biot-DA
(diffusive approximation) model. The properties of both the Biot-JKD and the
Biot-DA model are analyzed: hyperbolicity, decrease of energy, dispersion. To
determine the coefficients of the diffusive approximation, two approaches are
analyzed: Gaussian quadratures and optimization methods in the frequency range
of interest. The nonlinear optimization is shown to be the better way of
determination. A splitting strategy is then applied to approximate numerically
the Biot-DA equations. The propagative part is discretized using a fourth-order
ADER scheme on a Cartesian grid, whereas the diffusive part is solved exactly.
An immersed interface method is implemented to take into account heterogeneous
media on a Cartesian grid and to discretize the jump conditions at interfaces.
Numerical experiments are presented. Comparisons with analytical solutions show
the efficiency and the accuracy of the approach, and some numerical experiments

Galactic dispersion measure foreground. Therefore,they evidently have an
extragalactic origin. We investigate possible contributions to the dispersion
measure from host galaxies. We simulate the spatial distribution of fast radio
bursts and calculate the dispersion measures along the sightlines from fast
radio bursts to the edge of host galaxies by using the scaled NE2001 model for
thermal electron density distributions. We find that contributions to the
dispersion measure of fast radio bursts from the host galaxy follow a skew
Gaussian distribution. The peak and the width at half maximum of the dispersion
measure distribution increase with the inclination angle of a spiral galaxy, to
large values when the inclination angle is over $70\degr$. The largest
dispersion measure produced by an edge-on spiral galaxy can reach a few
thousand pc~cm$^{-3}$, while the dispersion measures from dwarf galaxies and
elliptical galaxies have a maximum of only a few tens of pc~cm$^{-3}$. Notice,
however, that additional dispersion measures of tens to hundreds of
pc~cm$^{-3}$ can be produced by high density clumps in host galaxies.
Simulations that include dispersion measure contributions from the Large
Magellanic Cloud and the Andromeda Galaxy are shown as examples to demonstrate
how to extract the dispersion measure from the intergalactic medium.

present an extension to the micro-macro transition method, called

novel averaging method is advantageous, e.g. when compared to binning methods,
because the obtained macroscopic fields are consistent with the continuum
equations of mass, momentum, and energy balance. Additionally, boundary
interaction forces can be taken into account in a self-consistent way and thus
allow for the construction of continuous stress fields even within one particle
radius of the boundaries. Similarly, stress and drag forces can also be
determined for individual constituents of a multi-component mixture, which is
essential for several continuum applications, \textit{e.g.} mixture theory
segregation models. Moreover, the method does not require ensemble-averaging

developed to exploit the structure of strictly second-order (SO) non-circular
(NC) signals. They achieve a higher estimation accuracy and can resolve up to
twice as many signal sources compared to the traditional methods for arbitrary
signals. In this paper, as a benchmark for these NC methods, we derive the
closed-form deterministic R-D NC Cramer-Rao bound (NC CRB) for the
multi-dimensional parameter estimation of strictly non-circular (rectilinear)
signal sources. Assuming a separable centro-symmetric R-D array, we show that
in some special cases, the deterministic R-D NC CRB reduces to the existing
deterministic R-D CRB for arbitrary signals. This suggests that no gain from
strictly non-circular sources (NC gain) can be achieved in these cases. For
more general scenarios, finding an analytical expression of the NC gain for an
arbitrary number of sources is very challenging. Thus, in this paper, we
simplify the derived NC CRB and the existing CRB for the special case of two
closely-spaced strictly non-circular sources captured by a uniform linear array
(ULA). Subsequently, we use these simplified CRB expressions to analytically
compute the maximum achievable asymptotic NC gain for the considered two source
case. The resulting expression only depends on the various physical parameters
and we find the conditions that provide the largest NC gain for two sources.
Our analysis is supported by extensive simulation results.

systems. Solar supergranules exhibit a preferred sense of rotation, which
depends on the hemisphere. This is due to the Coriolis force acting on the
diverging horizontal flows. We aim to spatially resolve the vertical flow
vorticity of the average supergranule at different latitudes, both for outflow
and inflow regions. To measure the vertical vorticity, we use two independent
techniques: time-distance helioseismology (TD) and local correlation tracking
of granules in intensity images (LCT) using data from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Both maps
are corrected for center-to-limb systematic errors. We find that 8-h TD and LCT
maps of vertical vorticity are highly correlated at large spatial scales.
Associated with the average supergranule outflow, we find tangential (vortical)
flows that reach about 10 m/s in the clockwise direction at 40{\deg} latitude.
In average inflow regions, the tangential flow reaches the same magnitude, but
in the anti-clockwise direction. These tangential velocities are much smaller
than the radial (diverging) flow component (300 m/s for the average outflow and
200 m/s for the average inflow). The results for TD and LCT as measured from
HMI are in excellent agreement for latitudes between $-$60{\deg} and 60{\deg}.
From HMI LCT, we measure the vorticity peak of the average supergranule to have
a full width at half maximum of about 13 Mm for outflows and 8 Mm for inflows.
This is larger than the spatial resolution of the LCT measurements (about 3
Mm). On the other hand, the vorticity peak in outflows is about half the value
measured at inflows (e.g. 4/(10^6 s) clockwise compared to 8/(10^6 s)
anti-clockwise at 40{\deg} latitude). Results from MDI/SOHO obtained in 2010

convertibility between the state for $\mu$ and that for $\mu+\delta\mu$,
depends on the quantum phases of the system ($\delta\mu$ is a perturbation).
This is similar to the adiabatic case where the ground state is considered.
Specifically, when the quenched system has edge modes and the subsystem size
for the partition is much larger than the correlation length of the Majorana
fermions which forms the edge modes, the quenched state is locally
inconvertible. We give a physical interpretation for the result, based on
analyzing the interactions between the two subsystems for various partitions.

linear dependence between ${\delta}_{np}$ and the mean $N/Z$ [N(Z) is
neutron(proton) number] of PLF is obtained as well.} The results show that
thicker neutron skin will lead to smaller {isoscaling parameter} $\alpha$ and
N/Z. Therefore, it may be probable to extract information of neutron skin
thickness from {isoscaling parameter} $\alpha$ and N/Z.

optically thick emission from the innermost accretion flow onto the central
supermassive black hole, indicate that RLQs tend to be EUV weak compared to the
radio quiet quasars (RQQs); yet the remainder of the optically thick thermal
continuum is indistinguishable. The deficit of EUV emission in RLQs has a
straightforward interpretation as a missing or a suppressed innermost region of
local energy dissipation in the accretion flow. This article is an examination
of the evidence for a distribution of magnetic flux tubes in the innermost
accretion flow that results in magnetically arrested accretion (MAA) and
creates the EUV deficit. These same flux tubes and possibly the interior
magnetic flux that they encircle are the source of the jet power as well. In
the MAA scenario, islands of large scale magnetic vertical flux perforate the
innermost accretion flow of RLQs. The first prediction of the theory that is
supported by the HST data is that the strength of the (large scale poloidal
magnetic fields) jets in the MAA region is regulated by the ram pressure of the
accretion flow in the quasar environment. The second prediction that is
supported by the HST data is that the rotating magnetic islands remove energy
from the accretion flow as a Poynting flux dominated jet in proportion to the
square of the fraction of the EUV emitting gas that is displaced by these
islands.

This question is central for database designers and administrators, cloud
service providers, and SSD constructors. The answer depends on
write-amplification, i.e., garbage collection overhead. More specifically, the
answer depends on how write-amplification evolves in time.
  How then can one model and manage write-amplification, especially when
application workloads change? This is the focus of this paper. Managing
write-amplification boils down to managing the surplus physical space, called
over-provisioned space. Modern SSDs essentially separate the physical space
into several partitions, based on the update frequency of the pages they
contain, and divide the over-provisioned space among the groups so as to
minimize write-amplification. We introduce Wolf, a block manager that allocates
over-provisioned space to SSD partitions using a near-optimal closed-form
expression, based on the sizes and update frequencies of groups of pages. Our
evaluation shows that Wolf is robust to workloads change, with an improvement
factor of 2 with respect to the state-of-the-art. We also show that Wolf
performs comparably and even slightly better than the state of the art with
stable workloads (over 20% improvement with a TPC-C workload).

has become an appreciated tool to compute the effective interactions. The
Wick-ordered constrained functional renormalization group (cfRG) generalizes
the cRPA approach by including all interaction channels in an unbiased way.
Here we present applications of the cfRG to two simple multi-band systems and
compare the resulting effective interactions to the cRPA. First we consider a
multiband model for monolayer graphene, where we integrate out the
$\sigma$-bands to get an effective theory for $\pi$-bands. It turns out that
terms beyond cRPA are strongly suppressed by the different $xy$-plane
reflection symmetry of the bands. In our model the cfRG-corrections to cRPA
become visible when one disturbs this symmetry difference slightly, however
without qualitative changes. This study shows that the embedding or layering of
two-dimensional electronic systems can alter the effective interaction
parameters beyond what is expected from screening considerations. The second
example is a one-dimensional model for a diatomic system reminiscent of a CuO
chain, where we consider an effective theory for Cu 3d-like orbitals. Here the
fRG data shows relevant and qualitative corrections compared to the cRPA
results. We argue that the new interaction terms affect the magnetic properties

the manipulation of the modulation instability is of primary importance in

instability can be partially suppressed, can change its spectrum (for instance
the long wave instability can transform into short wave instability), can split

practical interest, as can be used to stabilize the intrinsically unstable
system. The result bears general character, as it is shown here on a universal

We attribute this difference to relativistic effects, which results in an
enhanced density of d-states at the Fermi energy for Au compared with Ag. We
further show that the alignment of the conducting orbital relative to the Fermi
level does not follow the work function difference between two metals and is
different for conjugated and saturated systems. We thus demonstrate that the

important work has been done on the issue of community detection, very little
attention has been devoted to the analysis of the community structure. In this
paper, we present an extensive investigation of the overlapping community
network deduced from a large-scale co-authorship network. The nodes of the
overlapping community network represent the functional communities of the
co-authorship network, and the links account for the fact that communities
share some nodes in the co-authorship network. The comparative evaluation of
the topological properties of these two networks shows that they share similar
topological properties. These results are very interesting. Indeed, the network
of communities seems to be a good representative of the original co-authorship
network. With its smaller size, it may be more practical in order to realize
various analyses that cannot be performed easily in large-scale real-world
networks.

instrument, we selected more than 4000 galaxies from their rest-frame emission
at 8 microns, from z~0.2 to 2$. We built SEDs from the rest-frame UV to the
far-IR by adding data in the optical-NIR and from GALEX and Herschel surveys.
We fit SEDs with the physically-motivated code CIGALE. We test different
templates for AGNs and recipes for dust attenuation and estimate stellar
masses, SFRs, amount of dust attenuation, and AGN contribution to the total IR
luminosity. The AGN contribution to the total IR luminosity is found to be on
average approximately 10% with a slight increase with redshift. Dust
attenuation in galaxies dominating the IR luminosity function is found to
increase from z=0 to z=1 and to remain almost constant from z=1 to z=1.5.
Conversely, when galaxies are selected at a fixed IR luminosity, their dust
attenuation slightly decreases as redshift increases but with a large
dispersion. The attenuation in our mid-IR selected sample is found ~ 2 mag
higher than that found globally in the universe or in UV and Halpha line
selections in the same redshift range. This difference is well explained by an
increase of dust attenuation with the stellar mass, in global agreement with
other recent studies. Starbursting galaxies do not systematically exhibit a
high attenuation

billion solar masses black holes also powered $z\geq 6$ quasars. One efficient
way to form such black holes is the collapse of a massive primordial gas cloud
into a so-called direct collapse black hole. The main requirement for this
scenario is the presence of large accretion rates of $\rm \geq
0.1~M_{\odot}/yr$ to form a supermassive star. It is not yet clear how and
under what conditions such accretion rates can be obtained. The prime aim of
this work is to determine the mass accretion rates under non-isothermal
collapse conditions. We perform high resolution cosmological simulations for
three primordial halos of a few times $\rm 10^7~M_{\odot}$ illuminated by an
external UV flux, $\rm J_{21}=100-1000$. We find that a rotationally supported
structure of about parsec size is assembled, with an aspect ratio between $\rm
0.25 - 1$ depending upon the thermodynamical properties. Rotational support,
however, does not halt collapse, and mass inflow rates of $\rm \sim
0.1~M_{\odot}/yr$ can be obtained in the presence of even a moderate UV
background flux of strength $\rm J_{21} \geq 100$. To assess whether such large
accretion rates can be maintained over longer time scales, we employed sink
particles, confirming the persistence of accretion rates of $\rm \sim
0.1~M_{\odot}/yr$. We propose that complete isothermal collapse and molecular
hydrogen suppression may not always be necessary to form supermassive stars,
precursors of black hole seeds. Sufficiently high inflow rates can be obtained
for UV flux $\rm J_{21}=500-1000$, at least for some cases. This value brings
the estimate of the abundance of direct collapse black hole seeds closer to
that high redshift quasars.

predicted in thin films of the SnTe class of IV-VI semiconductors, which can
host metallic edge states protected by mirror symmetry. As thickness decreases,
quantum confinement effect will increase and surpass the inverted gap below a
critical thickness, turning TCIs into normal insulators. Surprisingly, based on
first-principles calculations, here we demonstrate that (001) monolayers of
rocksalt IV-VI semiconductors XY (X=Ge, Sn, Pb and Y= S, Se, Te) are 2D TCIs
with the fundamental band gap as large as 260 meV in monolayer PbTe, providing
a materials platform for realizing two-dimensional Dirac fermion systems with
tunable band gap. This unexpected nontrivial topological phase stems from the
strong {\it crystal field effect} in the monolayer, which lifts the degeneracy
between $p_{x,y}$ and $p_z$ orbitals and leads to band inversion between cation
$p_z$ and anion $p_{x,y}$ orbitals. This crystal field effect induced
topological phase offers a new strategy to find and design other atomically
thin 2D topological materials.

sulfur, are candidate materials for spin filters, one of the key devices in
spintronics. We present here a computational study of the inversion
thermodynamics and the electronic structure of these (thio)spinels for $M=$ Cr,
Mn, Co, Ni, using calculations based on the density functional theory with
on-site Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$). The analysis of the configurational free
energies shows that different behaviour is expected for the equilibrium cation
distributions in these structures: FeCr$_2X_4$ and FeMn$_2$S$_4$ are fully
normal, FeNi$_2X_4$ and FeCo$_2$S$_4$ are intermediate, and FeCo$_2$O$_4$ and
FeMn$_2$O$_4$ are fully inverted. We have analyzed the role played by the size
of the ions and by the crystal field stabilization effects in determining the
equilibrium inversion degree. We also discuss how the electronic and magnetic
structure of these spinels is modified by the degree of inversion, assuming
that this could be varied from the equilibrium value. We have obtained
electronic densities of states for the completely normal and completely inverse
cation distribution of each compound. FeCr$_2X_4$, FeMn$_2X_4$, FeCo$_2$O$_4$
and FeNi$_2$O$_4$ are half-metals in the ferrimagnetic state when Fe is in
tetrahedral positions. When $M$ is filling the tetrahedral positions, the
Cr-containing compounds and FeMn$_2$O$_4$ are half-metallic systems, while the
Co and Ni spinels are insulators. The Co and Ni sulfide counterparts are
metallic for any inversion degree together with the inverse FeMn$_2$S$_4$. Our
calculations suggest that the spin filtering properties of the Fe$M_2X_4$
(thio)spinels could be modified via the control of the cation distribution
through variations in the synthesis conditions.

the interplay between the long-range Coulomb repulsion and the cavity-induced

strong to overcome photon decay. We study the stationary states of ions coupled
with a mode of a standing-wave cavity as a function of the cavity and laser
parameters, when the typical length scales of the two self-organizing
processes, Coulomb crystallization and photon-mediated interactions, are
incommensurate. The dynamics are frustrated and in specific limiting cases can
be cast in terms of the Frenkel-Kontorova model, which reproduces features of
friction in one dimension. We numerically recover the sliding and pinned
phases. For strong cavity nonlinearities, they are in general separated by
bistable regions where superlubric and stick-slip dynamics coexist. The cavity,
moreover, acts as a thermal reservoir and can cool the chain vibrations to
temperatures controlled by the cavity parameters and by the ions phase. These
features are imprinted in the radiation emitted by the cavity, which is readily
measurable in state-of-art setups of cavity quantum electrodynamics.

leads to a well-posed inverse problem in which the posterior distribution is
Lipschitz with respect to the observed data; and secondly it leads to
computationally expedient algorithms in which the level set itself is updated
implicitly via the MCMC methodology applied to the level set function- no
