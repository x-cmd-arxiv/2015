concentration of Au-implanted polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and alumina
nanocomposite thin films. For Au contents larger than a critical concentration,
the conductivity of Au-PMMA and Au-alumina is well described by percolation in
two dimensions, indicating that the critical correlation length for percolation
is larger than the thickness of the films. Below the critical loading, the
conductivity is dominated by tunneling processes between isolated Au particles
dispersed in PMMA or alumina continuous matrices. Using an effective medium
analysis of the tunneling conductivity, we show that Au-PMMA behaves as a
tunneling system in two dimensions, as the film thickness is comparable to the
mean Au particle size. On the contrary, the conductivity of Au-alumina films is
best described by tunneling in three dimensions, although the film thickness is
only a few times larger than the particle size. We interpret the enhancement of
the effective dimensionality of Au-alumina films in the tunneling regime as due
to the larger film thickness as compared to the mean interparticle distances.

(BEC) usually arise as a response to externally driven rotation. Apart from a
few special situations, these vortices are singly quantized with unit
circulation. Recently, the NIST group has constructed a two-component BEC with
a spin-orbit coupled Hamiltonian involving Pauli matrices, and I here study the
dynamics of a two-component vortex in such a spin-orbit coupled condensate.
These spin-orbit coupled BECs use an applied magnetic field to split the
hyperfine levels. Hence they rely on a focused laser beam to trap the atoms. In
addition, two Raman laser beams create an effective (or synthetic) gauge
potential. The resulting spin-orbit Hamiltonian is discussed in some detail.
The various laser beams are fixed in the laboratory, so that it is not feasible
to nucleate a vortex by an applied rotation that would need to rotate all the
laser beams and the magnetic field. In a one-component BEC, a vortex can also
be created by a thermal quench, starting from the normal state and suddenly
cooling deep into the condensed state. I propose that a similar method would
work for a vortex in a spin-orbit coupled BEC. Such a vortex has two
components, and each has its own circulation quantum number. If both components
have the same circulation, I find that the composite vortex should execute
uniform precession, like that observed in a single-component BEC. In contrast,
if one component has unit circulation and the other has zero circulation, then
some fraction of the dynamical vortex trajectories should eventually leave the
condensate, providing clear experimental evidence for this unusual vortex
structure. In the context of exciton-polariton condensates, such a vortex is
known as a ""half-quantum vortex"".

as a mean value between states and observables defined through the correlation
functions. Then the von Neumann definition of entropy can be applied to these
quantum states and in particular, for the partial traces taken over the
internal or external degrees of freedom. This procedure can be done for each
order in the perturbation expansion showing that the entanglement entropy for
real and virtual particles behaves as $\ln (m_{0})$. In particular,
entanglement entropy is computed at first order for the correlation function of
two external points showing that mutual information is identical to the
external entropy and that conditional entropies are negative for all the domain
of $m_{0}$. In turn, from the definition of the quantum states, it is possible
to obtain general relations between total traces between different quantum
states of a r theory. Finally, discussion about the possibility of taking
partial traces over external degrees of freedom is considered, which implies
the introduction of some observables that measure space-time points where

fundamental when devising effective disease containment strategies. Policy
makers are faced with the intricate task of drafting realistically
implementable policies that strike a balance between risk management and cost.
Two major techniques policy makers have at their disposal are: epidemic
modeling and contact tracing. Models are used to forecast the evolution of the
epidemic both globally and regionally, while contact tracing is used to
reconstruct the chain of people who have been potentially infected, so that
they can be tested, isolated and treated immediately. However, both techniques
might provide limited information, especially during an already advanced crisis
when the need for action is urgent.
  In this paper we propose an alternative approach that goes beyond epidemic
modeling and contact tracing, and leverages behavioral data generated by mobile
carrier networks to evaluate contagion risk on a per-user basis. The individual
risk represents the loss incurred by not isolating or treating a specific
person, both in terms of how likely it is for this person to spread the disease
as well as how many secondary infections it will cause. To this aim, we develop
a model, named Progmosis, which quantifies this risk based on movement and
regional aggregated statistics about infection rates. We develop and release an
open-source tool that calculates this risk based on cellular network events. We
simulate a realistic epidemic scenarios, based on an Ebola virus outbreak; we
find that gradually restricting the mobility of a subset of individuals reduces
the number of infected people after 30 days by 24%.

function of transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and collision centrality show an
enhancement compared to a cocktail simulation of hadronic sources in the low
invariant-mass region ($M_{ee}<$ 1 GeV/$c^2$). This enhancement cannot be
reproduced by the $\rho$-meson vacuum spectral function. In minimum-bias
collisions, in the invariant-mass range of 0.30 $-$ 0.76 GeV/$c^2$, integrated
over the full $p_{\rm T}$ acceptance, the enhancement factor is 1.76 $\pm$ 0.06
(stat.) $\pm$ 0.26 (sys.) $\pm$ 0.29 (cocktail). The enhancement factor
exhibits weak centrality and $p_{\rm T}$ dependence in STAR's accessible
kinematic regions, while the excess yield in this invariant-mass region as a
function of the number of participating nucleons follows a power-law shape with
a power of 1.44 $\pm$ 0.10. Models that assume an in-medium broadening of the
$\rho$ meson spectral function consistently describe the observed excess in
these measurements. Additionally, we report on measurements of $\omega$ and
$\phi$-meson production through their $e^+e^-$ decay channel. These
measurements show good agreement with Tsallis Blast-Wave model predictions as
well as, in the case of the $\phi$-meson, results through its $K^+K^-$ decay
channel. In the intermediate invariant-mass region (1.1$<M_{ee}<$ 3 GeV/$c^2$),
we investigate the spectral shapes from different collision centralities.
Physics implications for possible in-medium modification of charmed hadron
production and other physics sources are discussed.

potential at first order. We use a semiclassical approach, where the
perturbative corrections to neutrino scattering, evaluated at one-loop in the
Standard Model, are compared with the Einstein formula for the deflection using
an impact parameter formulation. For this purpose, we use the renormalized
expression of the graviton/fermion/fermion vertex presented in previous
studies. We show the agreement between the classical and the semiclassical
formulations, for values of the impact parameter $b_h$ of the neutrinos of the
order of $b_h\sim 20$, measured in units of the Schwarzschild radius. The
analysis is then extended with the inclusion of the post Newtonian corrections
in the external gravity field, showing that this extension finds application in
the case of the scattering of a neutrino/photon off a primordial black hole.
The energy dependence of the deflection, generated by the quantum corrections,
is then combined with the standard formulation of the classical lens equations.
We illustrate our approach by detailed numerical studies, using as a reference

Cu$_2$ZnSn(S,Se)$_4$ photovoltaic devices have been hampered due to several
materials issues, including cation disorder. Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ is a promising new
absorber material that has attracted significant interest in recent years.
However, similar to CZTS, Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ displays cation disorder. In this work,
we develop synthetic techniques to control the disorder in Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ thin
films. By manipulating the disorder in this material, we observe crystal
structure changes and detect improvements in the majority carrier (hole)
transport. However, when the minority carrier (electron) transport was
investigated using optical pump terahertz probe spectroscopy, minimal
differences were observed between the ordered and disordered Cu$_2$SnS$_3$. By
combining these results with first-principles and Monte Carlo theoretical
calculations, we are able to conclude that even ostensibly ""ordered""
Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ displays minority carrier transport properties corresponding to
the disordered structure. The presence of extended planar defects in all
samples, observed in TEM imaging, suggests that disorder is present even when
it is not detectable using traditional structural characterization methods. The
results of this study highlight some of the challenges to the further
improvement of Cu$_2$SnS$_3$-based photovoltaics, and have implications for
other disordered multinary semiconductors such as CZTS.

higher- order accurate numerical approximations of ordinary differential
equations. SDC starts with an initial approximation of the solution defined at
a set of Gaussian or spectral collocation nodes over a time interval and uses
an iterative application of lower-order time discretizations applied to a
correction equation to improve the solution at these nodes. Each deferred
correction sweep increases the formal order of accuracy of the method up to the
limit inherent in the accuracy defined by the collocation points. In this
paper, we demonstrate that SDC is well suited to recovering from soft
(transient) hardware faults in the data. A strategy where extra correction
iterations are used to recover from soft errors and provide algorithmic
resilience is proposed. Specifically, in this approach the iteration is
continued until the residual (a measure of the error in the approximation) is
small relative to the residual on the first correction iteration and changes
slowly between successive iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
strategy for both canonical test problems and a comprehen- sive situation
involving a mature scientific application code that solves the reacting

flow model to derive the emission line fluxes, emission measure distribution,
and H-like to He-like line ratios for comparison with the 496 ks Chandra High

ratios are not well reproduced by this simple isobaric cooling flow model and
show that while H-like line fluxes can be accurately predicted, fluxes of
lower-Z He-like lines are significantly underestimated. This discrepancy
suggests that some extra heating mechanism plays an important role at the base
of the accretion column, where cooler ions form. We thus explored more complex
cooling models including the change of gravitational potential with height in
the accretion column and a magnetic dipole geometry. None of these
modifications to the standard cooling flow model are able to reproduce the
observed line ratios. While a cooling flow model with subsolar (0.1 $\odot$)
abundances is able to reproduce the line ratios by reducing the cooling rate at
temperatures lower than $\sim 10^{7.3}$ K, the predicted line-to-continuum

thermalization and black hole physics. In this article, we refine and extend
the `random unitaries framework' to quantum field theories (QFT), and to
include conserved charges. We show that in QFT, the connection between typical
states, reduced subsystems and thermal dynamics is more transparent within the
Fock basis. We provide generic formulae for the typical reduced density
matrices and entanglement entropies of any given subset of particles. To
illustrate our methods, we apply the generic framework to the simplest but non
trivial cases, a massless scalar field in two dimensions and its generalization
to the case of N scalar fields, including the large N limit. We find the
effective temperature, by matching the reduced dynamics to a Gibbs ensemble,
and derive the equation of state of the QFT. The deviations from perfect
thermality are shown to be of order 1/S instead of exp(-S), a result which
might be relevant for black hole physics. Finally we describe the analogue of
the so-called `Page curve' in the QFT scenario as a function of the energy
scale which divides high from low energy degrees of freedom.

(tLFG) systems of arbitrary architecture. This is accomplished using an
integrated virtual crystal approximation and tight-binding (VCA-TB) method,
where the VCA is achieved by a mathematical averaging formalism developed over
the quasi-infinite ensemble of interlayer bond configurations. The results show
that the low-energy electronic band structures of the incommensurate tLFG
systems of N graphene layers are formed of N overlapping Dirac cones centered
on the K-points of the Brillouin zones of the graphene layers. This yields
effective gaps between the saddle points of the valence and conduction bands of
these tFLG systems, that are tunable with the incommensurate twist angles. The
optical absorption spectra are also calculated for these systems; in
particular, they display clear spectral peaks which correspond to the
accessible electronic transitions across the gaps between the valence and
conduction bands. The optical absorption results highlight the potential of
these incommensurate tFLG systems for applications in graphene based tandem
cells.

In particular, we analyze the limits of applicability of the GK plasma model
compared to a fully kinetic description of force free current sheets for finite
guide fields ($b_g$). Here we report the first part of an extended comparison,
focusing on the macroscopic effects of the electron flows. For a low beta
plasma ($\beta_i=0.01$), it is shown that both plasma models develop magnetic
reconnection with similar features in the secondary magnetic islands if a
sufficiently high guide field ($b_g\gtrsim 30$) is imposed in the kinetic PIC
simulations. Outside of these regions, in the separatrices close to the X
points, the convergence between both plasma descriptions is less restrictive
($b_g\gtrsim 5$). Kinetic PIC simulations using guide fields $b_g \lesssim 30$
reveal secondary magnetic islands with a core magnetic field and less energetic
flows inside of them in comparison to the GK or kinetic PIC runs with stronger
guide fields. We find that these processes are mostly due to an initial shear
flow absent in the GK initialization and negligible in the kinetic PIC high
guide field regime, in addition to fast outflows on the order of the ion
thermal speed that violate the GK ordering. Since secondary magnetic islands
appear after the reconnection peak time, a kinetic PIC/GK comparison is more
accurate in the linear phase of magnetic reconnection. For a high beta plasma
($\beta_i=1.0$) where reconnection rates and fluctuations levels are reduced,
similar processes happen in the secondary magnetic islands in the fully kinetic
description, but requiring much lower guide fields ($b_g\lesssim 3$).

deterministic algorithms for multi-broadcast for different settings that
reflect the different types of knowledge about the topology of the network

recently emerged and spread in important healthcare applications, such as the
remote monitoring of health conditions of patients. A major issue associated
with the deployment of such networks is represented by energy consumption: in
general, the batteries of the sensors cannot be easily replaced and recharged,
so containing the usage of energy by a rational design of the network and of
the routing is crucial. Another issue is represented by traffic uncertainty:
body sensors may produce data at a variable rate that is not exactly known in
advance, for example because the generation of data is event-driven. Neglecting
traffic uncertainty may lead to wrong design and routing decisions, which may
compromise the functionality of the network and have very bad effects on the
health of the patients. In order to address these issues, in this work we
propose the first robust optimization model for jointly optimizing the topology
and the routing in body area networks under traffic uncertainty. Since the
problem may result challenging even for a state-of-the-art optimization solver,
we propose an original optimization algorithm that exploits suitable linear
relaxations to guide a randomized fixing of the variables, supported by an
exact large variable neighborhood search. Experiments on realistic instances
indicate that our algorithm performs better than a state-of-the-art solver,
fast producing solutions associated with improved optimality gaps.

diamagnetic shielding fractions of up to 56% in Cu0.3Bi2Se3 have been obtained,

various quenching and annealing conditions, finding that quenching from
temperatures above 560C is essential for superconductivity, whereas quenching
from lower temperatures or not quenching at all is detrimental. A modified
floating zone (FZ) method yielded large single crystals but little
superconductivity. Even after annealing and quenching, FZ-grown samples had
much less chance of being superconducting than MG-grown samples. From the low
shielding fractions in FZ-grown samples and the quenching dependence, we
suggest that a metastable secondary phase having a small volume fraction in
most of the samples may be responsible for the superconductivity.

efficient ways to solve the family of $\ell_2$-regularized empirical risk
minimization problems, including linear SVM, logistic regression, and many
others. The vanilla implementation of DCD is quite slow; however, by
maintaining primal variables while updating dual variables, the time complexity
of SDCD can be significantly reduced. Such a strategy forms the core algorithm
in the widely-used LIBLINEAR package. In this paper, we parallelize the SDCD
algorithms in LIBLINEAR. In recent research, several synchronized parallel SDCD
algorithms have been proposed, however, they fail to achieve good speedup in
the shared memory multi-core setting. In this paper, we propose a family of
asynchronous stochastic dual coordinate descent algorithms (ASDCD). Each thread
repeatedly selects a random dual variable and conducts coordinate updates using
the primal variables that are stored in the shared memory. We analyze the
convergence properties when different locking/atomic mechanisms are applied.
For implementation with atomic operations, we show linear convergence under
mild conditions. For implementation without any atomic operations or locking,
we present the first {\it backward error analysis} for ASDCD under the
multi-core environment, showing that the converged solution is the exact
solution for a primal problem with perturbed regularizer. Experimental results
show that our methods are much faster than previous parallel coordinate descent

In other words, inter-country social ties lead to increased fitness of the
international network. To study the competition between an international
network and local ones, we construct a 1:1000 scale model of the digital world,
consisting of the 80 countries with the most Internet users. Under certain
conditions, this leads to the extinction of local networks; whereas under
different conditions, local networks can persist and even dominate completely.
In particular, our model suggests that, with the parameters that best reproduce
the empirical overtake of Facebook, this overtake could have not taken place
with a significant probability.

$x_{i}-x_{j}$; the observation pattern is represented by a measurement graph
$\mathcal{G}$ with an edge set $\mathcal{E}$ such that $x_{i}-x_{j}$ is
observed if and only if $(i,j)\in\mathcal{E}$. To account for noisy
measurements in a general manner, we model the data acquisition process by a
set of channels with given input/output transition measures. Employing
information-theoretic tools applied to channel decoding problems, we develop a
\emph{unified} framework to characterize the fundamental recovery criterion,
which accommodates general graph structures, alphabet sizes, and channel
transition measures. In particular, our results isolate a family of
\emph{minimum} \emph{channel divergence measures} to characterize the degree of
measurement corruption, which together with the size of the minimum cut of
$\mathcal{G}$ dictates the feasibility of exact information recovery. For
various homogeneous graphs, the recovery condition depends almost only on the
edge sparsity of the measurement graph irrespective of other graphical metrics;
alternatively, the minimum sample complexity required for these graphs scales
like \[ \text{minimum sample complexity }\asymp\frac{n\log
n}{\mathsf{Hel}_{1/2}^{\min}} \] for certain information metric
$\mathsf{Hel}_{1/2}^{\min}$ defined in the main text, as long as the alphabet
size is not super-polynomial in $n$. We apply our general theory to three
concrete applications, including the stochastic block model, the outlier model,
and the haplotype assembly problem. Our theory leads to order-wise tight
recovery conditions for all these scenarios.

need to focus on a subset of issues and aspects to convey to their audience.
Outlets are often accused of exhibiting a systematic bias in this selection
process, with different outlets portraying different versions of reality.
However, in the absence of objective measures and empirical evidence, the
direction and extent of systematicity remains widely disputed.
  In this paper we propose a framework based on quoting patterns for
quantifying and characterizing the degree to which media outlets exhibit
systematic bias. We apply this framework to a massive dataset of news articles
spanning the six years of Obama's presidency and all of his speeches, and
reveal that a systematic pattern does indeed emerge from the outlet's quoting
behavior. Moreover, we show that this pattern can be successfully exploited in
an unsupervised prediction setting, to determine which new quotes an outlet
will select to broadcast. By encoding bias patterns in a low-rank space we
provide an analysis of the structure of political media coverage. This reveals
a latent media bias space that aligns surprisingly well with political ideology
and outlet type. A linguistic analysis exposes striking differences across
these latent dimensions, showing how the different types of media outlets
portray different realities even when reporting on the same events. For
example, outlets mapped to the mainstream conservative side of the latent space
focus on quotes that portray a presidential persona disproportionately
characterized by negativity.

large Drell-Yan background. However, there may be significant production of the
Z' boson in processes involving other dark sector particles, resulting in final
states with a Z' resonance and missing transverse momentum. Examples of such
processes include cascade decays within the dark sector and radiation of the Z'
off of final state dark sector particles. Even when the rate to produce a Z'
boson in a dark sector process is suppressed, this channel can provide better
sensitivity than traditional collider probes of dark sectors such as monojet
searches. We find that data from the 8 TeV LHC run can be interpreted to give
bounds on such processes; more optimized searches could extend the sensitivity

50% complete above 70 $M_\odot$. The mass distributions for the entire sample

function, with approximately power-law distributions at high mass. Power-law
behavior emerges more clearly when the sample population is narrowed in
heliocentric distance (power-law index $\alpha = 2.0\pm0.1$ for sources nearer
than 6.5 kpc and $\alpha = 1.9\pm0.1$ for objects between 2 kpc and 10 kpc).
The high-mass power-law indices are generally $1.85 \leq \alpha \leq 2.05$ for
various subsamples of sources, intermediate between that of giant molecular
clouds and the stellar initial mass function. The fit to the entire sample
yields a high-mass power-law $\hat{\alpha} = 1.94_{-0.10}^{+0.34}$. Physical
properties of BGPS sources are consistent with large molecular cloud clumps or
small molecular clouds, but the fractal nature of the dense interstellar medium

detected a change of slope in the NIR spectrum between the J and Ks bands,

the HKs part is typical of optically thin synchrotron emission. Furthermore,
the comparison of our IR data with radio and X-ray data shows that H1743-322

dual AGNs have hard X-ray luminosities that are half of those of single AGNs at

of gas funneled to galaxy centers during mergers, and emphasizes the need for

hydrogen (Ly$\alpha$ absorption-lines) in the CGM of 92% of the galaxies. We
find the radial profile of the CGM as traced by the Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width
can be fit as an exponential with a scale length of roughly the virial radius
of the dark matter halo. We found no correlation between the orientation of
sightline relative to the galaxy major axis and the Ly$\alpha$ equivalent
width. The velocity spread of the circumgalactic gas is consistent with that
seen in the atomic gas in the interstellar medium. We find a strong correlation
(99.8% confidence) between the gas fraction (M(HI)/M*) and the
impact-parameter-corrected Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width. This is stronger than
the analogous correlation between corrected Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width and
SFR/M* (97.5% confidence). These results imply a physical connection between
the HI disk and the CGM, which is on scales an order-of-magnitude larger. This

in statistics of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large scale
structure fluctuations, can be used to probe non-trivial initial quantum states
for these perturbations. The bispectrum shapes predicted for generic
non-Bunch-Davies initial states are non-factorizable (""non-separable"") and are
highly oscillatory functions of the three constituent wavenumbers. This can
make the computation of CMB bispectra, in particular, computationally
intractable. To efficiently compare with CMB data one needs to construct a
separable template that has a significant similarity with the actual shape in
momentum space. In this paper we consider a variety of inflationary scenarios,
with different non-standard initial conditions, and how best to construct
viable template matches. In addition to implementing commonly used separable
polynomial and Fourier bases, we introduce a basis of localized piecewise
spline functions. The spline basis is naturally nearly orthogonal, making it
easy to implement and to extend to many modes. We show that, in comparison to
existing techniques, the spline basis can provide better fits to the true
bispectrum, as measured by the cosine between shapes, for sectors of the theory
space of general initial states. As such, it offers a useful approach to
investigate non-trivial features generated by fundamental properties of the
inflationary Universe.

insulators, where electrons are localized in clusters, rather than at lattice
sites. It is shown that these cluster Mott insulators are generally U(1)
quantum spin liquids with spinon Fermi surfaces. The nature of charge
excitations in cluster Mott insulators can be quite different from conventional
Mott insulator and we show that there exists a novel cluster Mott insulator
where charge fluctuations around the hexagonal cluster induce a plaquette
charge order (PCO). The spinon excitation spectrum in this spin-liquid cluster
Mott insulator is reconstructed due to the PCO so that only 1/3 of the total

that the two Curie-Weiss regimes of the spin susceptibility in LiZn2Mo3O8 may
be explained by finite-temperature properties of the cluster Mott insulator
with the PCO as well as fractionalized spinon excitations. Existing and
possible future experiments on LiZn2Mo3O8, and other Mo-based cluster magnets

spectroscopically confirmed, infrared-selected galaxy cluster at $z = 1.75$.
This cluster is the most massive galaxy cluster currently known at $z > 1.5$,
based on existing Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) and gravitational lensing detections.
We confirm this high mass via a variety of X-ray scaling relations, including
$T_X$-M, $f_g$-M, $Y_X$-M and $L_X$-M, finding a tight distribution of masses
from these different methods, spanning M$_{500}$ = 2.3-3.3 $\times 10^{14}$
M$_{\odot}$, with the low-scatter $Y_X$-based mass $M_{500,Y_X} =
2.6^{+1.5}_{-0.5} \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. IDCS J1426.5+3508 is currently the
only cluster at $z > 1.5$ for which X-ray, SZ and gravitational lensing mass
estimates exist, and these are in remarkably good agreement. We find a
relatively tight distribution of the gas-to-total mass ratio, employing total
masses from all of the aforementioned indicators, with values ranging from
$f_{gas,500}$ = 0.087-0.12. We do not detect metals in the intracluster medium
(ICM) of this system, placing a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of $Z(r < R_{500}) < 0.18
Z_{\odot}$. This upper limit on the metallicity suggests that this system may
still be in the process of enriching its ICM. The cluster has a dense,
low-entropy core, offset by $\sim$30 kpc from the X-ray centroid, which makes
it one of the few ""cool core"" clusters discovered at $z > 1$, and the first
known cool core cluster at $z > 1.2$. The offset of this core from the
large-scale centroid suggests that this cluster has had a relatively recent
($\lesssim$500 Myr) merger/interaction with another massive system.

compact groups over the past 3 Gyr. This paper focuses on the evolution of the
nuclear activity and how it has been affected by the dense environment of the
groups. Our analysis is based on the largest multiwavelength compact group
sample to-date, containing complete ultraviolet-to-infrared (UV-to-IR)
photometry for 1,770 isolated groups (7,417 galaxies). We classified the
nuclear activity of the galaxies based on optical emission line and
mid-infrared diagnostic methods, as well as using spectral energy distribution
fitting. We observe a 15% increase on the number of the AGN-hosting late-type
galaxies found in dynamically old groups, over the past 3 Gyr, accompanied by
the corresponding decrease of their circumnuclear star formation. Comparing our
compact group results with those of local isolated field and interacting pair
galaxies, we find no differences in the AGN at the same redshift range. Based
on both optical and mid-IR colour classifications, we report the absence of
Seyfert 1 nuclei and we attribute this to the low accretion rates, caused by
the depletion of gas. We propose that the observed increase of LINER and
Seyfert 2 nuclei (at low-z's), in the early-type galaxies of the dynamically
young groups, is due to the morphological transformation of lenticular into
elliptical galaxies. Finally, we show that at any given stellar mass, galaxies
found in dynamically old groups are more likely to host an AGN. Our findings
suggest that the depletion of gas, due to past star formation and tidal
stripping, is the major mechanism driving the evolution of the nuclear activity
in compact groups of galaxies.

bulge, the long bar, using red clump giant (RCG) stars from UKIDSS, 2MASS, VVV,
and GLIMPSE. We match and combine these surveys to investigate a wide area in
latitude and longitude, |b|<9deg and |l|<40deg. We find: (1) The bar extends to
l~25deg at |b|~5deg from the Galactic plane, and to l~30deg at lower latitudes.
(2) The long bar has an angle to the line-of-sight in the range (28-33)deg,
consistent with studies of the bulge at |l|<10deg. (3) The scale-height of RCG
stars smoothly transitions from the bulge to the thinner long bar. (4) There is
evidence for two scale heights in the long bar. We find a ~180pc thin bar
component reminiscent of the old thin disk near the sun, and a ~45pc super-thin
bar component which exists predominantly towards the bar end. (5) Constructing
parametric models for the RC magnitude distributions, we find a bar half length
of 5.0+-0.2kpc for the 2-component bar, and 4.6+-0.3kpc for the thin bar
component alone. We conclude that the Milky Way contains a central box/peanut
bulge which is the vertical extension of a longer, flatter bar, similar as seen
in both external galaxies and N-body models.

reproduction on a graph with two levels of interactions modeling
metapopulations. The population is spatially distributed into patches and
offspring are produced in each patch at a rate proportional to the number of
pairs of individuals in the patch (sexual reproduction) rather than simply the
number of individuals as in the basic contact process. Offspring produced at a
given patch either stay in their parents' patch or are sent to a nearby patch
with some fixed probabilities. As the patch size tends to infinity, we identify
a mean-field limit consisting of an infinite set of coupled differential
equations. For the mean-field equations, we find explicit conditions for
survival and extinction that we call expansion and retreat. Using duality
techniques to compare the stochastic model to its mean-field limit, we find
that expansion and retreat are also precisely the conditions needed to ensure
survival and extinction of the stochastic model when the patch size is large.
In addition, we study the dependence of survival on the dispersal range. We
find that, with probability close to one and for a certain set of parameters,
the metapopulation survives in the presence of nearest neighbor interactions
while it dies out in the presence of long range interactions, suggesting that
the best strategy for the population to spread in space is to use intermediate
dispersal ranges.

clusters with stacking the scaled amplitudes of background galaxy ellipticities
as a function of the scaled centric radius according to the NFW prediction of
each cluster, based on the assumption that the different clusters in a sample
follow the universal NFW profile. First we demonstrate the feasibility of this
method using both the analytical NFW model and simulated halos in
high-resolution $N$-body simulations. We then apply, as a proof of concept,
this method to the Subaru weak lensing data and the XMM/Chandra X-ray
observables for a sample of 50 massive clusters in the redshift range $0.15\le
z\le 0.3$, where their halo masses range over an order of magnitude. To
estimate the NFW parameters of each cluster, we use the halo mass proxy
relation of X-ray observables, based on either the hydrostatic equilibrium or
the gas mass, and then infer the halo concentration from the model $c(M)$
relation. We evaluate a performance of the NFW scaling analysis by measuring
the scatters of 50 cluster lensing profiles relative to the NFW predictions
over a range of radii, $0.14\le R/[h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}]\le 2.8$. We found a 4 -
6$\sigma$ level evidence of the universal NFW profile in 50 clusters, for both
the X-ray halo mass proxy relations, although the gas mass appears to be a
better proxy of the underlying true mass. By comparing the measurements with
the simulations of cluster lensing taking into account the statistical errors
of intrinsic galaxy shapes in the Subaru data, we argue that additional halo
mass errors or intrinsic scatters of $\sigma_{\ln M_{500c}}\sim 0.2$ - $0.3$
could reconcile a difference between the measurements and the simulations.

event, approximately 30 million years (Myr) after the condensation of the first
solids in the Solar System, whereas others claim a date later than 50 Myr (and
possibly as late as around 100 My) after condensation. Here we show that a
Moon-forming event at 40 Myr after condensation, or earlier, is ruled out at a
99.9 per cent confidence level. We use a large number of N-body simulations to
demonstrate a relationship between the time of the last giant impact on an
Earth-like planet and the amount of mass subsequently added during the era
known as Late Accretion. As the last giant impact is delayed, the late-accreted
mass decreases in a predictable fashion. This relationship exists within both
the classical scenario and the Grand Tack scenario of terrestrial planet
formation, and it holds across a wide range of disk conditions. The
concentration of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in Earth's mantle
constrains the mass of chondritic material added to Earth during Late
Accretion. Using HSE abundance measurements, we determine a Moon-formation age
of 95 +/- 32 Myr since condensation. The possibility exists that some late
projectiles were differentiated and left an incomplete HSE record in Earth's
mantle. Even in this case, various isotopic constraints strongly suggest that
the late-accreted mass did not exceed 1 per cent of Earth's mass, and so the
HSE clock still robustly limits the timing of the Moon-forming event to
significantly later than 40 My after condensation.

predicted by the model, the average HMI supergranule is very extended in depth,
exhibiting horizontal outflow down to $7$--$10$~Mm, followed by a weak inflow
reaching a depth of $\sim20$~Mm below the photosphere. The maximal velocities
in the horizontal direction for the average supergranule are much smaller than
the model, and its near-surface flow field RMS value is about an order of
magnitude smaller than the often-quoted values of
$\sim250-350$~$\rm{m\,s^{-1}}$ for supergranulation. Much of the overall HMI
supergranule structure and its weak flow amplitudes can be explained by
examining the HMI pipeline averaging kernels for the near-surface inversions,
which are found to be very broad in depth, and nearly identical to one another
in terms of sensitivity along the $z$-direction. We also show that
forward-modeled travel times in the Born approximation using the model (derived
from a ray theory approach) are inconsistent with measured travel times for an

simulations of chromospheric reconnection, the current sheet thins to the scale
of the neutral-ion mean free path and the ion and neutral outflows are strongly
coupled. However, the ion and neutral inflows are asymmetrically decoupled. In
cases with magnetic asymmetry, a net flow of neutrals through the current sheet
from the weak field (high density) upstream region into the strong field
upstream region results from a neutral pressure gradient. Consequently,
neutrals dragged along with the outflow are more likely to originate from the
weak field region. The Hall effect leads to the development of a characteristic
quadrupole magnetic field modified by asymmetry, but the X-point geometry
expected during Hall reconnection does not occur. All simulations show the

and a string $w$ of length $n$, decide if $w$ can be obtained from
$\mathcal{G}$. This is the most basic parsing question and is a core computer
science problem. Valiant's parser from 1975 solves the problem in
$O(n^{\omega})$ time, where $\omega<2.373$ is the matrix multiplication
exponent. Dozens of parsing algorithms have been proposed over the years, yet
Valiant's upper bound remains unbeaten. The best combinatorial algorithms have
mildly subcubic $O(n^3/\log^3{n})$ complexity.
  Lee (JACM'01) provided evidence that fast matrix multiplication is needed for
CFG parsing, and that very efficient and practical algorithms might be hard or
even impossible to obtain. Lee showed that any algorithm for a more general
parsing problem with running time $O(|\mathcal{G}|\cdot n^{3-\varepsilon})$ can
be converted into a surprising subcubic algorithm for Boolean Matrix
Multiplication. Unfortunately, Lee's hardness result required that the grammar
size be $|\mathcal{G}|=\Omega(n^6)$. Nothing was known for the more relevant
case of constant size grammars.
  In this work, we prove that any improvement on Valiant's algorithm, even for
constant size grammars, either in terms of runtime or by avoiding the
inefficiencies of fast matrix multiplication, would imply a breakthrough
algorithm for the $k$-Clique problem: given a graph on $n$ nodes, decide if
there are $k$ that form a clique.

We show how this subextensive degeneracy is lifted by a quantum

emission in the presence of a large thermal background) can be problematic due
to an unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio. An approach is presented to use
time-series spectroscopy to separate non-equilibrium quantities from slowly
varying equilibria. A stochastic process associated with the non-equilibrium
part of the spectrum is characterized in terms of its central moments or
cumulants, which may vary over time. This parameterization encodes information
about the non-equilibrium behavior of the system.
  Stochastic time-series spectroscopy (STSS) can be implemented at very little
expense in many settings since a series of scans are typically recorded in
order to generate a low-noise averaged spectrum. Higher moments or cumulants
may be readily calculated from this series, enabling the observation of
quantities that would be difficult or impossible to determine from an average
spectrum or from prinicipal components analysis (PCA).
  This method is more scalable than PCA, having linear time complexity, yet it
can produce comparable or superior results, as shown in example applications.
One example compares an STSS-derived CO$_2$ bending mode to a standard
reference spectrum and the result of PCA. A second example shows that STSS can
reveal conditions of stress in rocks, a scenario where traditional methods such
as PCA are inadequate. This allows spectral lines and non-equilibrium behavior
to be precisely resolved. A relationship between 2nd order STSS and a
time-varying form of PCA is considered. Although the possible applications of
STSS have not been fully explored, it promises to reveal information that
previously could not be easily measured, possibly enabling new domains of
spectroscopy and remote sensing.

cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the EAGLE and LOCAL GROUPS
projects and compare them with a compilation of observed rotation curves of
galaxies spanning a wide range in mass. The shape of the circular velocity
profiles of simulated galaxies varies systematically as a function of galaxy
mass, but shows remarkably little variation at fixed maximum circular velocity.
This is especially true for low-mass dark matter-dominated systems, reflecting
the expected similarity of the underlying cold dark matter haloes. This is at
odds with observed dwarf galaxies, which show a large diversity of rotation
curve shapes, even at fixed maximum rotation speed. Some dwarfs have rotation
curves that agree well with simulations, others do not. The latter are systems
where the inferred mass enclosed in the inner regions is much lower than
expected for cold dark matter haloes and include many galaxies where previous
work claims the presence of a constant density ""core"". The ""cusp vs core"" issue
is thus better characterized as an ""inner mass deficit"" problem than as a
density slope mismatch. For several galaxies the magnitude of this inner mass
deficit is well in excess of that reported in recent simulations where cores
result from baryon-induced fluctuations in the gravitational potential. We
conclude that one or more of the following statements must be true: (i) the
dark matter is more complex than envisaged by any current model; (ii) current
simulations fail to reproduce the effects of baryons on the inner regions of
dwarf galaxies; and/or (iii) the mass profiles of ""inner mass deficit"" galaxies
inferred from kinematic data are incorrect.

to be efficiently solvable with existing classical methods, but emerging
quantum optimization technology gives hope for achieving sparser models in
practice. In order to demonstrate the utility of our algorithm, we use a
distributed classical heuristic optimizer as a stand-in for quantum hardware.
Even though this evaluation methodology incurs large time and resource costs on
classical computing machinery, it allows us to gauge the potential gains in
generalization performance and sparsity of the resulting boosted ensembles. Our
experimental results on public data sets commonly used for benchmarking of
boosting algorithms decidedly demonstrate the existence of such advantages. If
actual quantum optimization were to be used with this algorithm in the future,
we would expect equivalent or superior results at much smaller time and energy
costs during training. Moreover, studying cardinality-penalized boosting also
sheds light on why unregularized boosting algorithms with early stopping often
yield better results than their counterparts with explicit convex
regularization: Early stopping performs suboptimal cardinality regularization.
The results that we present here indicate it is beneficial to explicitly solve
the combinatorial problem still left open at early termination.

creating coded-multicasting opportunities, the coded-cache scheme can provide
extra performance gain over the conventional push technique that simply
pre-stores contents at local caches during the network idle period. But
existing works on the coded caching scheme assumed the availability of an
error-free shared channel accessible by each user. This paper considers the
more realistic scenario where each user may experience different link quality.
In this case, the system performance would be restricted by the user with the
worst channel condition. And the corresponding resource allocation schemes
aimed at breaking this obstacles are developed. Specifically, we employ the
coded caching scheme in time division and frequency division transmission mode
and formulate the sub-optimal problems. Power and bandwidth are allocated

the throughput of the technique in wireless scenario will be limited and would

important role in processing signals and information related to networks.
Existing works have shown that under certain conditions a smooth graph signal
can be uniquely reconstructed from its decimation, i.e., data associated with a
subset of vertices. However, in some potential applications (e.g., sensor
networks with clustering structure), the obtained data may be a combination of
signals associated with several vertices, rather than the decimation. In this
paper, we propose a new concept of local measurement, which is a generalization
of decimation. Using the local measurements, a local-set-based method named
iterative local measurement reconstruction (ILMR) is proposed to reconstruct
bandlimited graph signals. It is proved that ILMR can reconstruct the original
signal perfectly under certain conditions. The performance of ILMR against
noise is theoretically analyzed. The optimal choice of local weights and a
greedy algorithm of local set partition are given in the sense of minimizing
the expected reconstruction error. Compared with decimation, the proposed local
measurement sampling and reconstruction scheme is more robust in noise existing
scenarios.

Such geometry presents a challenge to first-principles transport methods. We
solve this problem by implementing a plane-wave based multiple scattering
theory for electron transport. This implementation improves the computational
efficiency over the existing plane-wave transport code, scales better for
parallelization over large number of nodes, and does not require the current
direction to be along a lattice axis. As a first application, we calculate the
tunneling current through a side-contact graphene junction formed by two
separate graphene sheets with the edges overlapping each other. We find that
transport properties of this junction depend strongly on the AA or AB stacking
within the overlapping region as well as the vacuum gap between two graphene
sheets. Such transport behaviors are explained in terms of carbon orbital

Group Actions"", Ralf Meyer showed how to construct generalized fixed-point
algebras for $ C^{\ast} $-dynamical systems via their square-integrable
representations on Hilbert $ C^{\ast} $-modules. His method extends Marc
Rieffel's construction of generalized fixed-point algebras from proper group
actions on $ C^{\ast} $-algebras. This dissertation seeks to generalize Meyer's
work to construct generalized fixed-point algebras for twisted $ C^{\ast}
$-dynamical systems. To accomplish this, we must introduce some new concepts,
the foremost being that of a twisted Hilbert $ C^{\ast} $-module, which is a
Hilbert $ C^{\ast} $-module equipped with a twisted group action by bijective
linear isometries that is compatible with the module's right $ C^{\ast}
$-algebra action and its $ C^{\ast} $-algebra-valued inner product. Twisted
Hilbert $ C^{\ast} $-modules over a fixed twisted $ C^{\ast} $-dynamical system
form a category, where morphisms are twisted-equivariant adjointable operators.
Given a twisted $ C^{\ast} $-dynamical system, we provide a definition of a
relatively continuous subspace of a twisted Hilbert $ C^{\ast} $-module
(inspired by an idea due to Ruy Exel), and then prescribe a method of
constructing, from such a subspace, a generalized fixed-point algebra that is
Morita-Rieffel equivalent to an ideal of the corresponding reduced twisted
crossed product. Our construction thus generalizes that of Meyer and, by
extension, that of Rieffel. Our main result is the description of a classifying
category for the class of all Hilbert modules over a reduced twisted crossed
product. This implies that every Hilbert module over a $ d $-dimensional
non-commutative torus can be constructed from a Hilbert space endowed with a
twisted $ \mathbb{Z}^{d} $-action by unitary operators and a relatively
continuous subspace.

which is based on Fourier analysis, provides a criterion to distinguish
Shannon-Nyquist sampling from compressed sensing. A new signal recovery
formula, which is analogous to Donoho-Stark formula, is given using the idea of
Shannon-Nyquist sampling; in this formulation, the smearing of information
below the uncertainty limit as well as the recovery of information with
specified bandwidth take place. We also discuss the recovery of states from the
domain below the uncertainty limit of coordinate and momentum in quantum
mechanics and show that in principle the state recovery works by assuming ideal
measurement procedures. The recovery of the lost information in the
sub-uncertainty domain means that the loss of information in such a small
domain is not fatal, which is in accord with our common understanding of the
uncertainty principle, although its precise recovery is something we are not
used to in quantum mechanics. The uncertainty principle provides a universal
sampling criterion covering both the classical Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem

ratio with other supernovae. Results. The core oxygen mass of the supernova
progenitor was estimated to be $\lesssim$0.7 M$_\odot$, which implies initial
progenitor mass not exceeding $\sim$15 -- 17 M$_\odot$. Since the derived mass
is too small for a single star to become a Wolf-Rayet star, this result lends
more support to the binary nature of the progenitor star of iPTF13bvn. The

selected out of the entire two-dimensional crystal. These tailored modes can
mediate spin-spin interactions between ion-qubits on a hexagonal plaquette when
subject to state-dependent optical dipole forces. We discuss how these
interactions can be employed to emulate a generalized Balents-Fisher-Girvin
model in minimal instances of one and two plaquettes. This model is an
archetypical Hamiltonian in which gauge fields are the emergent degrees of
freedom on top of the classical ground state manifold. Under realistic
situations, we show the emergence of a discrete Gauss's law as well as the
dynamics of a deconfined charge excitation on a gauge-invariant background
using the two-plaquettes trapped ions spin-system. The proposed scheme in
principle allows further scaling in a future trapped ion quantum simulator, and
we conclude that our work will pave the way towards the simulation of emergent
gauge theories and quantum spin liquids in trapped ion systems.

recognize non-uniform license plates, the main contribution is in creating an
end to end usable solution. The client application runs on a mobile device and
a server application, with access to vehicle information database, is hosted
centrally. The solution enables capture of license plate image captured by the
phone camera and passes to the server; on the server the license plate number
is recognized; the data associated with the number plate is then sent back to
the mobile device, instantaneously. We describe the end to end system

is initially fed into the highest frequency part of the spectrum, while in the

This relaxation process leads to the formation of chaotic breathers in both one

time scales that increase as the energy density is decreased. We supplement
this study by considering the nonconservative case, where the FPU lattice is
homogeneously driven at high frequencies. Standing and travelling nonlinear
waves and solitonic patterns are detected in this case. Finally we investigate
the dynamics of the FPU chain when one end is driven at a frequency located

due to the high-energy particle impulse generated by the flare (known as
`sunquakes' in the Sun). We analyze short-cadence Kepler data of 257 flares in
75 stars to search for QPP in the flare decay branch or post-flare oscillations
which may be attributed to either of these two mechanisms. About 18 percent of
stellar flares show a distinct bump in the flare decay branch of unknown
origin. The bump does not seem to be a highly-damped global oscillation because
the periods of the bumps derived from wavelet analysis do not correlate with
any stellar parameter. We detected damped oscillations covering several cycles
(QPP), in seven flares on five stars. The periods of these oscillations also do
not correlate with any stellar parameter, suggesting that these may be a due to
flare loop oscillations. We searched for forced global oscillations which might
result after a strong flare. To this end, we investigated the behaviour of the
amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in eight stars before and after a flare.
However, no clear amplitude change could be detected. We also analyzed the
amplitudes of the self-excited pulsations in two delta Scuti stars and one
gamma Doradus star before and after a flare. Again, no clear amplitude changes
were found. Our conclusions are that a new process needs to be found to explain
the high incidence of bumps in stellar flare light curves, that flare loop
oscillations may have been detected in a few stars and that no conclusive
evidence exists as yet for flare induced global acoustic oscillations

tighter constraints than the results from the Cassini satellite and Big Bang

spoken speech to text and in addition a language processing engine to take care
of any misrecognitions by the speech recognition engine. Any off-the-shelf
speech recognition engine is generally a combination of acoustic processing and
speech grammar. While this is the norm, we believe that ideally a speech
recognition application should have in addition to a speech recognition engine
a separate language processing engine to give the system better performance. In
this paper, we discuss ways in which the speech recognition engine and the
language processing engine can be combined to give a better user experience.

ReHub, a novel main-memory algorithm that extends the Hub Labeling technique to

mean-field theory is first recalled. This approach is optimized to describe
one-body degrees of freedom. A special focus is made on how this microscopic
theory can be reduced to a macroscopic dynamic for a selected set of collective
variables. Important physical phenomena like adiabaticity/diabaticity, one-body
dissipation or memory effect are discussed. Special aspects related to the use
of a time-dependent density functional instead of a time-dependent Hartree-Fock
theory based on a bare hamiltonian are underlined. The absence of proper
description of complex internal correlations however strongly impacts the
predictive power of mean-field. A brief overview of theories going beyond the
independent particles/quasi-particles theory is given. Then, a special
attention is paid for finite fermionic systems at low internal excitation. In
that case, quantum fluctuations in collective space that are poorly treated at
the mean-field level, are important. Several approaches going beyond
mean-field, that are anticipated to improve the description of quantum
fluctuations, are discussed: the Balian-V\'en\'eroni variational principle, the
Time-Dependent Random Phase Approximation and the recently proposed Stochastic
Mean-Field theory. Relations between these theories are underlined as well as
their advantages and shortcomings.

that black hole thermodynamics can be constructed in an ordinary way, by

tangent-point (TP) method has long been the simplest way to infer velocities
for the inner, low latitude regions of the Galactic disk from observations of
the gas component. We test the validity of the method on realistic gas
distribution and kinematics of the Milky Way, using a numerical simulation of
the Galaxy. We show that the resulting velocity profile strongly deviates from
the true rotation curve of the simulation, as it overstimates it in the central
regions, and underestimates it around the bar corotation. Also, its shape
strongly depends on the orientation of the stellar bar. The discrepancies are
caused by highly non-uniform azimuthal velocities, and the systematic selection
by the TP method of high-velocity gas along the bar and spiral arms, or
low-velocity gas in less dense regions. The velocity profile is in good
agreement with the rotation curve only beyond corotation, far from massive
asymmetric structures. Therefore the observed velocity profile of the Milky Way
inferred by the TP method is expected to be very close to the true Galactic
rotation curve for 4.5<R<8 kpc. Another consequence is that the Galactic
velocity profile for R<4-4.5 kpc is very likely flawed by the non-uniform
azimuthal velocities, and does not represent the true Galactic rotation curve,
but instead local motions. The real shape of the innermost rotation curve is
probably shallower than previously thought. Using a wrong rotation curve has a
dramatic impact on the modelling of the mass distribution, in particular for
the bulge component of which derived enclosed mass within the central kpc and
scale radius are, respectively, twice and half of the actual values. We thus
strongly argue against using terminal velocities or the velocity curve from the
TP method for modelling the mass distribution of the Milky Way. (abridged)

The detector consists of a single layer of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) (
about 6700 m^2}) operated in streamer mode. The signal pick-up is obtained by
means of strips facing one side of the gas volume. The digital readout of the
signals, while allows a high space-time resolution in the shower front
reconstruction, limits the measurable energy to a few hundred TeV. In order to
fully investigate the 1-10 PeV region, an analog readout has been implemented
by instrumenting each RPC with two large size electrodes facing the other side
of the gas volume. Since December 2009 the RPC charge readout has been in
operation on the entire central carpet (about 5800 m^2). In this configuration
the detector is able to measure the particle density at the core position where
it ranges from tens to many thousands of particles per m^2. Thus ARGO-YBJ
provides a highly detailed image of the charge component at the core of air

of spintronics by allowing transfer of spin angular momentum to a whole new
class of materials. In a seminal letter to Nature [5], Kajiwara et al. showed
that by depositing Platinum (Pt, a normal metal) on top of a 1.3 $\mu$m thick
Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG, a magnetic insulator), one could effectively transfer
spin angular momentum through the interface between these two different
materials. The outstanding feature was the detection of auto-oscillation of the
YIG when enough dc current was passed in the Pt. This finding has created a
great excitement in the community for two reasons: first, one could control
electronically the damping of insulators, which can offer improved properties
compared to metals, and here YIG has the lowest damping known in nature;
second, the damping compensation could be achieved on very large objects, a
particularly relevant point for the field of magnonics [6,7] whose aim is to
use spin-waves as carriers of information. However, the degree of coherence of
the observed auto-oscillations has not been addressed in ref. [5]. In this
work, we emphasize the key role of quasi-degenerate spin-wave modes, which
increase the threshold current. This requires to reduce both the thickness and
lateral size in order to reach full damping compensation [8] , and we show
clear evidence of coherent spin-orbit torque induced auto-oscillation in
micron-sized YIG discs of thickness 20 nm.

processing, social networks, compressive sensing, biological data processing
etc., the signal of interest is known to be structured in several ways at the
same time. This premise has recently guided the research to the innovative and
meaningful idea of imposing multiple constraints on the parameters involved in
the problem under study. For instance, when dealing with problems whose
parameters form sparse and low-rank matrices, the adoption of suitably combined
constraints imposing sparsity and low-rankness, is expected to yield
substantially enhanced estimation results. In this paper, we address the
spectral unmixing problem in hyperspectral images. Specifically, two novel
unmixing algorithms are introduced, in an attempt to exploit both spatial
correlation and sparse representation of pixels lying in homogeneous regions of
hyperspectral images. To this end, a novel convex mixed penalty term is first
defined consisting of the sum of the weighted $\ell_1$ and the weighted nuclear
norm of the abundance matrix corresponding to a small area of the image
determined by a sliding square window. This penalty term is then used to
regularize a conventional quadratic cost function and impose simultaneously
sparsity and row-rankness on the abundance matrix. The resulting regularized
cost function is minimized by a) an incremental proximal sparse and low-rank
unmixing algorithm and b) an algorithm based on the alternating minimization
method of multipliers (ADMM). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is
illustrated in experiments conducted both on simulated and real data.

analogue to the classical Schur-Weyl duality in the setting of Deligne
categories.
  Given a finite-dimensional unital vector space $V$ (a vector space $V$ with a
chosen non-zero vector $\mathbf{1}$), we constructed a complex tensor power of
$V$: an $Ind$-object of the Deligne category $\underline{Rep}(S_t)$ which is a
Harish-Chandra module for the pair $(\mathfrak{gl}(V),
\bar{\mathfrak{P}}_{\mathbf{1}})$, where $\bar{\mathfrak{P}}_{\mathbf{1}}
\subset GL(V)$ is the mirabolic subgroup preserving the vector $\mathbf{1}$.
  This construction allowed us to obtain an exact contravariant functor
$\widehat{SW}_{t, V}$ from the category $\underline{Rep}^{ab}(S_t)$ (the
abelian envelope of the category $\underline{Rep}(S_t)$) to a certain
localization of the parabolic category $\mathcal{O}$ associated with the pair
$(\mathfrak{gl}(V), \bar{\mathfrak{P}}_{\mathbf{1}})$. In this paper, we
consider the case when $V = \mathbb{C}^{\infty}$. We define the appropriate
version of the parabolic category $\mathcal{O}$ and its localization, and show
that the latter is equivalent to a ""restricted"" inverse limit of categories
$\widehat{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathfrak{p}}_{t,\mathbb{C}^N}$ with $N$ tending to
infinity. The Schur-Weyl functors $\widehat{SW}_{t, \mathbb{C}^N}$ then give an
anti-equivalence between this category and the category
$\underline{Rep}^{ab}(S_t)$. This duality provides an unexpected tensor
structure on the category $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathfrak{p}_{\infty}}_{t,

consumed in a mobile network. Overlapping coverage of three to five mobile
network operators (MNOs) results in enormous amount of energy waste which is
avoidable. The traffic demands of the mobile networks vary significantly
throughout the day. As the offered load for all networks are not same at a
given time and the differences in energy consumption at different loads are
significant, multi-MNO capacity/coverage sharing can dramatically reduce energy
consumption of mobile networks and provide the MNOs a cost effective means to
cope with the exponential growth of traffic. In this paper, we propose an
energy saving market for a multi-MNO network scenario. As the competing MNOs
are not comfortable with information sharing, we propose a double auction
clearinghouse market mechanism where MNOs sell and buy capacity in order to
minimize energy consumption. In our setting, each MNO proposes its bids and
asks simultaneously for buying and selling multi-unit capacities respectively
to an independent auctioneer, i.e., clearinghouse and ends up either as a buyer
or as a seller in each round. We show that the mechanism allows the MNOs to
save significant percentage of energy cost throughout a wide range of network
load. Different than other energy saving features such as cell sleep or antenna
muting which can not be enabled at heavy traffic load, dynamic capacity sharing
allows MNOs to handle traffic bursts with energy saving opportunity.

a Jupiter-sized planet (mass 0.484+/-0.087MJup; radius 0.955+/-0.066RJup)
orbiting an evolved star with an orbital period of 5.208 51 +/- 0.000 38 days,
and CoRoT-29b, another Jupiter-sized planet (mass 0.85 +/- 0.20MJup; radius
0.90 +/- 0.16RJup) orbiting an oblate star with an orbital period of 2.850 570
+/- 0.000 006 days. The reason behind the asymmetry of the transit shape is not
understood at this point. Conclusions. These two new planetary systems have
very interesting properties and deserve further study, particularly in the case
of the star CoRoT-29.

intractable problem for many decades. We have now established a robust optical
statistical distance indicator, the H$\alpha$ surface brightness- radius or S-r
relation, which addresses this problem. We developed this relation from a
critically evaluated sample of primary calibrating PNe. The robust nature of
the method results from our revised calibrating distances with significantly
reduced systematic uncertainties, and the recent availability of high-quality
data, including updated nebular diameters and integrated H$\alpha$ fluxes. The
S-r technique is simple in its application, requiring only an angular size, an
integrated H\alpha\ flux, and the reddening to the PN. From these quantities,
an intrinsic radius is calculated, which when combined with the angular size,
yields the distance directly. Furthermore, we have found that optically thick
PNe tend to populate the upper bound of the trend, while optically-thin PNe
fall along the lower boundary in the S-r plane. This enables sub-trends to be
developed which offer even better precision in the determination of distances,
as good as 18 per cent in the case of optically-thin, high-excitation PNe. This
is significantly better than any previous statistical indicator. We use this
technique to create a catalogue of statistical distances for over 1100 Galactic
PNe, the largest such compilation in the literature to date. Finally, in an
appendix, we investigate both a set of transitional PNe and a range of PN
mimics in the S-r plane, to demonstrate its use as a diagnostic tool.
Interestingly, stellar ejecta around massive stars plot on a tight locus in S-r
space with the potential to act as a separate distance indicator for these
objects.

(Q-type) like MBAs. The total survey area was 1.5 deg^2 near ecliptic plane and
close to the opposition. We detected 150 MBAs with 4 bands (B, V , R, I) in
this survey. The range of absolute magnitude of detected asteroids was between
13 and 22 magnitude, which is equivalent to the size range of kilometer to
sub-kilometer diameter in MBAs. From this observation, 75 of 150 MBAs with
color uncertainty less than 0.1 were used in the spectral type analysis, and
two possible Q-type aster- oids were detected. This mean that the Q-type to
S-type ratio in MBAs is < 0.05. Meanwhile, the Q/S ratio in near Earth
asteroids (NEAs) has been estimated to be 0.5 to 2 (Binzel et al., 2004; Dandy

region with weathered, S-type surface into near Earth region and then obtain
their Q-type, non- weathered surface after undergoing re-surfacing process
there. The resur- facing mechanisms could be: 1. dispersal of surface material

referring to the behaviour of a physical system in the domain of the relevant

structure of the theory allows truth-value assignment in conformity with the
traditional conception of a correspondence theory of truth. Every proposition
in classical mechanics is assigned a definite truth value, either 'true' or
'false', describing what is actually the case at a certain moment of time.
Truth-value assignment in quantum mechanics, however, differs; it is known, by
means of a variety of 'no go' theorems, that it is not possible to assign
definite truth values to all propositions pertaining to a quantum system
without generating a Kochen-Specker contradiction. In this respect, the
Bub-Clifton 'uniqueness theorem' is utilized for arguing that truth-value
definiteness is consistently restored with respect to a determinate sublattice
of propositions defined by the state of the quantum system concerned and a
particular observable to be measured. An account of truth of contextual
correspondence is thereby provided that is appropriate to the quantum domain of
discourse. The conceptual implications of the resulting account are traced down
and analyzed at length. In this light, the traditional conception of
correspondence truth may be viewed as a species or as a limit case of the more
generic proposed scheme of contextual correspondence when the non-explicit
specification of a context of discourse poses no further consequences.

statistical data about their performance. Our measurements show that, on
average, losses both in the aluminium mirror and in the access waveguides
reduce the reflectivities to about~79\% of their target value. Moreover,
standard deviations lower than $\pm$5\% are obtained over a 20~nm wavelength

  Multi-Cloud Radio-Access Networks",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the context of resource allocation in cloud-radio access networks, recent
studies assume either signal-level or scheduling-level coordination. This
paper, instead, considers a hybrid level of coordination for the scheduling
problem in the downlink of a multi-cloud radio-access network, as a means to
benefit from both scheduling policies. Consider a multi-cloud radio access
network, where each cloud is connected to several base-stations (BSs) via high
capacity links, and therefore allows joint signal processing between them.
Across the multiple clouds, however, only scheduling-level coordination is
permitted, as it requires a lower level of backhaul communication. The frame
structure of every BS is composed of various time/frequency blocks, called
power-zones (PZs), and kept at fixed power level. The paper addresses the
problem of maximizing a network-wide utility by associating users to clouds and
scheduling them to the PZs, under the practical constraints that each user is
scheduled, at most, to a single cloud, but possibly to many BSs within the
cloud, and can be served by one or more distinct PZs within the BSs' frame. The
paper solves the problem using graph theory techniques by constructing the
conflict graph. The scheduling problem is, then, shown to be equivalent to a
maximum-weight independent set problem in the constructed graph, in which each
vertex symbolizes an association of cloud, user, BS and PZ, with a weight
representing the utility of that association. Simulation results suggest that
the proposed hybrid scheduling strategy provides appreciable gain as compared
to the scheduling-level coordinated networks, with a negligible degradation to
signal-level coordination.

middle ground between systems where the initial instability involves just a

secondary bifurcations, and cases where a system is highly turbulent and many
spatial and temporal modes are excited. It has been a rich source of novel
patterns and of theoretical work aimed at understanding how and why such
patterns occur. Yet it is particularly challenging to tie theory to experiment:
the experiments are difficult to perform; the parameter regime of interest
(large box, moderate viscosity) along with the technical difficulties of
solving the free boundary Navier--Stokes equations make numerical solution of
the problem hard; and the fact that the instabilities result in an entire
circle of unstable wavevectors presents considerable theoretical difficulties.

quantitative comparison between weakly nonlinear theory of the full

each play, the players have to pay a cost that they want to minimize. Instead
of the well-known notion of Nash equilibrium (NE), we focus on the notion of
subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE), a refinement of NE well-suited in the
framework of games played on graphs. We also study natural variants of SPE,
named weak (resp. very weak) SPE, where players who deviate cannot use the full
class of strategies but only a subclass with a finite number of (resp. a
unique) deviation step(s).
  Our results are threefold. Firstly, we characterize in the form of a Folk
theorem the set of all plays that are the outcome of a weak SPE. Secondly, for
the class of quantitative reachability games, we prove the existence of a
finite-memory SPE and provide an algorithm for computing it (only existence was
known with no information regarding the memory). Moreover, we show that the
existence of a constrained SPE, i.e. an SPE such that each player pays a cost
less than a given constant, can be decided. The proofs rely on our Folk theorem
for weak SPEs (which coincide with SPEs in the case of quantitative
reachability games) and on the decidability of MSO logic on infinite words.
Finally with similar techniques, we provide a second general class of games for
which the existence of a (constrained) weak SPE is decidable.

possible existence of liquid water on its surface. The potential presence of
liquid water depends on many factors such as, most importantly, surface
temperatures. The properties of the planetary atmosphere and its interaction
with the radiative energy provided by the planet's host star are thereby of
decisive importance. In this study we investigate the influence of different
main-sequence stars upon the climate of Earth-like extrasolar planets and their
potential habitability by applying a 3D Earth climate model accounting for
local and dynamical processes. The calculations have been performed for planets
with Earth-like atmospheres at orbital distances where the total amount of
energy received from the various host stars equals the solar constant. In
contrast to previous 3D modeling studies, we include the effect of ozone
radiative heating upon the vertical temperature structure of the atmospheres.
The global orbital mean results obtained have been compared to those of a 1D
radiative convective climate model. The different stellar spectral energy
distributions lead to different surface temperatures and due to ozone heating
to very different vertical temperature structures. As previous 1D studies we
find higher surface temperatures for the Earth-like planet around the K-type
star, and lower temperatures for the planet around the F-type star compared to
an Earth-like planet around the Sun. However, this effect is more pronounced in
the 3D model results than in the 1D model because the 3D model accounts for
feedback processes such as the ice-albedo and the water vapor feedback. Whether
the 1D model may approximate the global mean of the 3D model results strongly
depends on the choice of the relative humidity profile in the 1D model, which
is used to determine the water vapor profile.

multiple high-intensity band edges and also vortex core states located above

with a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep
learning framework for video classification, which is able to model static
spatial information, short-term motion, as well as long-term temporal clues in
the videos. Specifically, the spatial and the short-term motion features are
extracted separately by two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These two
types of CNN-based features are then combined in a regularized feature fusion
network for classification, which is able to learn and utilize feature
relationships for improved performance. In addition, Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks are applied on top of the two features to further model
longer-term temporal clues. The main contribution of this work is the hybrid
learning framework that can model several important aspects of the video data.
We also show that (1) combining the spatial and the short-term motion features
in the regularized fusion network is better than direct classification and
fusion using the CNN with a softmax layer, and (2) the sequence-based LSTM is
highly complementary to the traditional classification strategy without
considering the temporal frame orders. Extensive experiments are conducted on
two popular and challenging benchmarks, the UCF-101 Human Actions and the

  March 2015",,,,"cs.CY cs.DB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  A worldwide movement towards the publication of Open Government Data is
taking place, and budget data is one of the key elements pushing this trend.
Its importance is mostly related to transparency, but publishing budget data,
combined with other actions, can also improve democratic participation, allow
comparative analysis of governments and boost data-driven business. However,
the lack of standards and common evaluation criteria still hinders the
development of appropriate tools and the materialization of the appointed
benefits. In this paper, we present a model to analyse government initiatives
to publish budget data. We identify the main features of these initiatives with
a double objective: (i) to drive a structured analysis, relating some
dimensions to their possible impacts, and (ii) to derive characterization
attributes to compare initiatives based on each dimension. We define use
perspectives and analyse some initiatives using this model. We conclude that,
in order to favour use perspectives, special attention must be given to user
feedback, semantics standards and linking possibilities.

a checkerboard lattice, in which there are interactions (with strength $\nu$)
between the parallel dimers on half of the plaquettes. For the fully packed
interacting dimer model, we observe a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition
between the lowtemperature symmetry breaking and the high-temperature critical
phases; for the doped monomer-dimer casewith finite chemical potential $\mu$,
we also find an order-disorder phase transition which is of second order
instead. We use the boundary matrix product state approach to detect the KT and
second-order phase transitions and obtain the phase diagrams $\nu-T$ and
$\mu-T$ . Moreover, for the noninteracting monomer-dimer model (setting $\mu =
\nu = 0$), we get an extraordinarily accurate determination of the free energy
per site (negative of the monomer-dimer constant $h_2$) as $f=-0.662\, 798\,
972\, 833\, 746$ with the dimer density $n=0.638\, 123\, 109\, 228\, 547$, both

Combined with theoretical calculations of the strong interaction and a

traditions across Australia. Their general lack of astronomical training
resulted in misidentifications, transcription errors, and omissions in these
records. Additionally, many of these early records are fragmented. In western
Victoria and southeast South Australia, many astronomical traditions were
recorded, but curiously, some of the brightest stars in the sky were omitted.
Scholars claimed these stars did not feature in Aboriginal traditions. This
under-representation continues to be repeated in the literature, but current
research shows that some of these stars may in fact feature in Aboriginal
traditions and could be seasonal calendar markers. This paper uses established
techniques in cultural astronomy to identify seasonal stars in the traditions
of the Kaurna Aboriginal people of the Adelaide Plains, South Australia.

framework the presence of a physical detector arises naturally and work and its
statistics can be investigated in the most general case. In particular, we show
that the quantum coherence of the initial state can lead to measurable effects
on the moments of the work done on the system. At the same time, we recover the
known results if the initial state is a statistical mixture of energy
eigenstates. Our method can also be applied to measure the dissipated heat in
an open quantum system. By sequentially coupling the system to a detector, we
can track the energy dissipated in the environment while accessing only the

  Reconstructing Gaps in Time Series",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bidirectional recurrent neural networks (RNN) are trained to predict both in
the positive and negative time directions simultaneously. They have not been
used commonly in unsupervised tasks, because a probabilistic interpretation of
the model has been difficult. Recently, two different frameworks, GSN and NADE,
provide a connection between reconstruction and probabilistic modeling, which
makes the interpretation possible. As far as we know, neither GSN or NADE have
been studied in the context of time series before. As an example of an
unsupervised task, we study the problem of filling in gaps in high-dimensional
time series with complex dynamics. Although unidirectional RNNs have recently
been trained successfully to model such time series, inference in the negative
time direction is non-trivial. We propose two probabilistic interpretations of
bidirectional RNNs that can be used to reconstruct missing gaps efficiently.
Our experiments on text data show that both proposed methods are much more
accurate than unidirectional reconstructions, although a bit less accurate than
a computationally complex bidirectional Bayesian inference on the
unidirectional RNN. We also provide results on music data for which the
Bayesian inference is computationally infeasible, demonstrating the scalability
of the proposed methods.

defect formation together with the formation of a local magnetic moment.
First-principles calculations of hydrogenated graphene unravel the strong
interplay of spin-orbit and exchange couplings. The concept of magnetic
scattering resonances, recently introduced \cite{Kochan2014} is revisited by
describing the local magnetism through the self-consistent Hubbard model in the
mean field approximation in the dilute limit, while spin relaxation lengths and
transport times are computed using an efficient real space order N wavepacket
propagation method. Typical spin lifetimes on the order of 1 nanosecond are
obtained for 1 ppm of hydrogen impurities (corresponding to transport time
about 50 ps), and the scaling of spin lifetimes with impurity density is
described by the Elliott-Yafet mechanism. This reinforces the statement that
magnetism is the origin of the substantial spin polarization loss in the

time, thereby providing a fast source of low-entropy qubits. This effect
demonstrates that quantum thermal machines can surpass classical ones,
reminiscent of quantum advantages in other fields, and is applicable to a broad
range of technologically important scenarios.

present-day environment, galaxy stellar mass and morphology. The SFH is derived
by means of a non-parametric spectrophotometric model applied to individual
galaxies at z ~ 0.04- 0.1 in the WINGS clusters and the PM2GC field. The field
reconstructed evolution of the star formation rate density (SFRD) follows the
values observed at each redshift (Madau & Dickinson 2014), except at z > 2
where our estimate is ~ 1.7x higher than the high-z observed value. The slope
of the SFRD decline with time gets progressively steeper going from low mass to
high mass haloes. The decrease of the SFRD since z = 2 is due to 1) quenching -
50% of the SFRD in the field and 75% in clusters at z > 2 originated in
galaxies that are passive today - and 2) the fact that the average SFR of
today's star-forming galaxies has decreased with time. We quantify the
contribution to the SFRD(z) of galaxies of today's different masses and
morphologies. The current morphology correlates with the current star formation
activity but is irrelevant for the past stellar history. The average SFH
depends on galaxy mass, but galaxies of a given mass have different histories
depending on their environment. We conclude that the variation of the SFRD(z)
with environment is not driven by different distributions of galaxy masses and
morphologies in clusters and field, and must be due to an accelerated formation
in high mass haloes compared to low mass ones even for galaxies that will end
up having the same galaxy mass today.

Wide physics program of the experiment comprises study of hadron structure and

one of the important objectives of the COMPASS experiment is the exploration of
the transverse spin structure of the nucleon via spin (in)dependent azimuthal
asymmetries in single-hadron production in deep inelastic scattering of
polarized leptons off transversely polarized target. For this purpose a series
of measurements were made in COMPASS, using 160 GeV/c longitudinally polarized
muon beam and transversely polarized $^{6}LiD$ (in 2002, 2003 and 2004) and
$NH_{3}$ (in 2007 and 2010) targets. The experimental results obtained by
COMPASS for unpolarized target azimuthal asymmetries, Sivers and Collins

understanding of the three-dimensional nature of the nucleon. Giving access to
the entire ""twsit-2"" set of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution

candidates of this high energy neutrino precursor up to $\sim {\rm PeV}$.
Before leaving the progenitor, these high energy neutrinos must oscillate from
one flavor to another with matter effect in the envelope. Under the assumption
of a power-law stellar envelope density profile $\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with
an index $\alpha$, we study the properties of ${\rm TeV-PeV}$ neutrino
oscillation. We find that adiabatic conversion is violated for these neutrinos
so we do certain calibration of level crossing effect. The resonance condition
is reached for different energies at different radii. We notice that the
effective mixing angles in matter for ${\rm PeV}$ neutrinos are close to zero
so the transition probabilities from one flavor to another are almost invariant
for ${\rm PeV}$ neutrinos. We plot all the transition probabilities versus
energy of ${\rm TeV-PeV}$ neutrinos from the birth place to the surface of the
progenitor. With an initial flavor ratio
$\phi_{\nu_e}^0:\phi_{\nu_\mu}^0:\phi_{\nu_\tau}^0=1:2:0$, we plot how the
flavor ratio evolves with energy and distance when neutrinos are still in the
envelope, and further get the ratio when they reach the Earth. For ${\rm PeV}$
neutrinos, the ratio is always
$\phi_{\nu_e}:\phi_{\nu_\mu}:\phi_{\nu_\tau}\simeq0.30:0.37:0.33$ on Earth. In
addition, we discuss the dependence of the flavor ratio on energy and $\alpha$

was first enunciated in 1632 by Galileo Galilei in his Dialogo sopra i due

holding on Earth. We shall show that the same metaphor and some of the examples
in Galilei's book were already contained in the dialogue La cena de le Ceneri
(The Ash Wednesday Supper) published by Giordano Bruno in 1584. In fact,
Giordano Bruno largely anticipated the arguments of Galilei on the relativity
principle. It is likely that Galilei was aware of Bruno's work, and it is
possible that the young Galilei discussed with Bruno, since they both stayed in
Venezia for long periods in 1592.

in the high temperature range, with our high energy powder X-Ray diffraction

agreement is less impressive. This could be due to stronger phonon-phonon

bacterial gastroenteritis in the developed world, with human infections
typically arising from zoonotic transmission associated with infected meat,
especially poultry. Because this organism is not thought to survive well
outside of the gut, host associated populations are genetically isolated to
varying degrees. Therefore the likely origin of most Campylobacter strains can
be determined by host-associated variation in the genome. This is instructive
for characterizing the source of human infection at the population level.
However, some common strains appear to have broad host ranges, hindering source
attribution. Whole genome sequencing has the potential to reveal fine-scale
genetic structure associated with host specificity within each of these
strains.
  We found that rates of zoonotic transmission among animal host species in
ST-21, ST-45 and ST-828 clonal complexes were so high that the signal of host
association is all but obliterated. We attributed 89% of clinical cases to a
chicken source, 10% to cattle and 1% to pig. Our results reveal that common
strains of C. jejuni and C. coli infectious to humans are adapted to a
generalist lifestyle, permitting rapid transmission between different hosts.
Furthermore, they show that the weak signal of host association within these
complexes presents a challenge for pinpointing the source of clinical
infections, underlining the view that whole genome sequencing, powerful though
it is, cannot substitute for intensive sampling of suspected transmission
reservoirs.

not hard to produce high coherence estimates at periods around 15--22 and
50--60 years between these data sets. This is done in two independent ways, by
wavelets and by a periodogram method. But does a coherence of high value mean
that there is coherence of high significance? In order to investigate that,
four different measures for significance are studied. Due to the periodic
nature of the data, only Monte Carlo simulation based on a non-parametric
random phase method is appropriate.
  None of the high values of coherence then turn out to be significant. Coupled
with a lack of a physical mechanism that can connect these phenomena, the

chirality-dependent and can be significantly increased by varying the DMI.
These characteristics allow for enhanced control of domain wall motion in
nanotubes with DMI, increasing their potential as information carriers in
future logic and storage devices.

sources of noise which cause both low-frequency errors and spurious
high-frequency alterations. Therefore, rigorous statistical analysis is
required in order to separate true T-to-C base changes, following
cross-linking, from noise. So far, most of the existing PAR-CLIP data analysis
methods focus on discarding the low-frequency errors and rely on high-frequency
substitutions to report binding sites, not taking into account the possibility
of high-frequency false positive substitutions. Here, we introduce BMix, a new
probabilistic method which explicitly accounts for the sources of noise in PAR-
CLIP data and distinguishes cross-link induced T-to-C substitutions from low

mobile agents start from different nodes of a network and have to accomplish
the task of gathering which consists in getting all together at the same node
at the same time. An adversary chooses the initial nodes of the agents and
assigns a different positive integer (called label) to each of them. Initially,
each agent knows its label but does not know the labels of the other agents or
their positions relative to its own. Agents move in synchronous rounds and can
communicate with each other only when located at the same node. Up to f of the
agents are Byzantine. A Byzantine agent can choose an arbitrary port when it
moves, can convey arbitrary information to other agents and can change its
label in every round, in particular by forging the label of another agent or by
creating a completely new one.
  What is the minimum number M of good agents that guarantees deterministic
gathering of all of them, with termination?
  We provide exact answers to this open problem by considering the case when
the agents initially know the size of the network and the case when they do
not. In the former case, we prove M=f+1 while in the latter, we prove M=f+2.
More precisely, for networks of known size, we design a deterministic algorithm
gathering all good agents in any network provided that the number of good
agents is at least f+1. For networks of unknown size, we also design a
deterministic algorithm ensuring the gathering of all good agents in any
network but provided that the number of good agents is at least f+2. Both of
our algorithms are optimal in terms of required number of good agents, as each
of them perfectly matches the respective lower bound on M shown in [14], which
is of f+1 when the size of the network is known and of f+2 when it is unknown.

synchrotron radiation power loss, beam-beam interaction limitations, and
beamstrahlung, scaling laws are established that fix all parameters of the
Higgs factory, as functions of assumed radius $r$, and RF power $P$. at least
to a first approximation. Historically the accelerator formalisms of electron
and hadron rings have been distinguished largely by the importance of
synchrotron radiation for electrons, and its unimportance for protons. While
electron beams equilibrate within seconds, proton beam distributions have
survived largely intact for extended periods. For future hadron colliders, this
distinction will no longer be valid. This will have a large impact on the
design of the future FCC-pp proton collider whose parameters can be
extrapolated using formulas previously applicable only to electron rings. The
most important scaling law has the luminosity depending on $r$ and $P_{\rm rf}$
only as a function of their product $rP$. This relation simplifies choosing a
tunnel radius that is optimal for both Higgs factory and p,p collider while
(almost) minimizing the initial cost---by increasing $r$ and decreasing $P$

fails to synchronize at least one uniform transformation (that is,
transformation whose kernel has parts of equal size), and it has previously
been conjectured that a primitive group synchronizes every non-uniform

  The first goal of this paper is to prove that this conjecture is false, by
exhibiting primitive groups that fail to synchronize specific non-uniform
transformations of ranks $5$ and $6$. In addition we produce graphs whose
automorphism groups have approximately $\sqrt{n}$ \emph{non-synchronizing

this is extended to $n-3$ and $n-4$.
  Determining the exact spectrum of ranks for which there exist non-uniform

used tool when determining precise stellar parameters and stellar chemical
compositions. Besides three-dimensional models that consistently solve for
hydrodynamic processes, one-dimensional models that use an approximation for
convective energy transport play the major role.
  Aims. We use modern Balmer-line formation theory as well as spectral energy
distribution (SED) measurements for the Sun and Procyon to calibrate the model
parameter {\alpha} that describes the efficiency of convection in our 1D
models. Convection was calibrated over a significant range in parameter space,
reaching from F-K along the main sequence and sampling the turnoff and giant
branch over a wide range of metallicities. This calibration was compared to
theoretical evaluations and allowed an accurate modeling of stellar
atmospheres.
  Methods. We used Balmer-line fitting and SED fits to determine the convective
efficiency parameter {\alpha}. Both methods are sensitive to the structure and
temperature stratification of the deeper photosphere.
  Results. While SED fits do not allow a precise determination of the
convective parameter for the Sun and Procyon, they both favor values
significantly higher than 1.0. Balmer-line fitting, which we find to be more
sensitive, suggests that the convective efficiency parameter {\alpha} is
$\approx$ 2.0 for the main sequence and quickly decreases to $\approx$ 1.0 for
evolved stars. These results are highly consistent with predictions from 3D
models. While the values on the main sequence fit predictions very well,
measurements suggest that the decrease of convective efficiency as stars evolve
to the giant branch is more dramatic than predicted by models.

metal-insulator-metal (MIM) travelling wave transmission line rectifiers are
developed for ambient thermal energy harvesting at 30 THz. The transmission
lines are formed from two strips coupled either vertically or laterally. A
systematic design approach is presented, that shows how different components
can be integrated with each other with maximum radiation receiving nantenna
efficiency, maximum coupling efficiency between nantenna and rectifier, and
maximum MIM diode rectifier efficiency. The tunneling current of the rectifier
is calculated using the transfer matrix method (TMM) and the nonequilibrium
Green's function (NEGF). The figures of merit of the rectifier are analyzed,
and the effect of the metals and insulator choices on these merits is
investigated. A detailed parametric study of the coupled strips plasmonic
transmission lines is presented and thoroughly discussed. The overall
efficiencies of the proposed travelling wave rectennas are fully expressed and
compared. Due to the extremely small spacing between its two strips, the
nanodipole terminated by vertical coupled strips plasmonic transmission line
offers significantly higher efficiency than that terminated by a lateral
coupled strips line. However, the overall efficiency of the vertical coupled
strips rectenna is still very low due to the extremely low efficiency of the
MIM rectifier.

equation treats them on equal footing. In this work, we leverage this asymmetry
to construct a cross-mapping between space and time. This cross-mapping is
applied to simplify scattering in space-varying media, by eliminating the
infinite reflections between interfaces. The method is shown to transform the
implicit transfer matrix method into an explicit method for the analysis of
electromagnetic field scattering by a stratified medium.

inequalities for functions having zero mean value on the boundary of a
Lipschitz domain or on a measurable part of it. These estimates are useful for
various numerical methods, in particular, for a posteriori error estimation
methods for partial differential equations (PDEs). Therefore, we are mainly
focused on domains typical for numerical analysis (simplexes in 2d and 3d) and
suggest easily computable relations that provide sharp bounds of the respective
constants. Also, we investigate numerically the behavior of the constants in
the classical Poincare inequalities and compare these results with known
analytical estimates. In the last section, the estimates are used in order to
obtain new a posteriori estimates for an elliptic boundary value problem.

conserved charges; one is a screened (vanishing) Maxwell charge which is
directly associated with the massive vector mesons through the identically
conserved Maxwell current. A somewhat peculiar situation arises for couplings
of Hermitian matter fields to massive vector potentials; in that case the only
current is the screened Maxwell current and the coupling disappears in the
massless limit. In case of selfinteracting massive vector mesons the situation
becomes even more peculiar in that the usually renormalizability guaranteeing
validity of the first order power-counting criterion breaks down in second
order and requires the compensatory presence of additional Hermitian H-fields.
Some aspect of these observation have already been noticed in the BRST gauge
theoretic formulation, but here we use a new setting based on string-local
vector mesons which is required by Hilbert space positivity. The coupling to
H-fields induces Mexican hat like selfinteractions; they are not imposed and
bear no relation with spontaneous symmetry breaking; they are rather
consequences of the foundational causal localization properties realized in a
Hilbert space setting. In case of selfinteracting massive vectormesons their
presence is required in order to maintain the first order power-counting
restriction of renormalizability also in second order. The presentation of the
new Hilbert space setting for vector mesons which replaces gauge theory and
extends on-shell unitarity to its off-shell counterpart is the main motivation
for this work. The new Hilbert space setting also shows that the second order
Lie-algebra structure of selfinteracting vector mesons is a consequence of the
principles of QFT and promises a deeper understanding of the origin of
confinement.
