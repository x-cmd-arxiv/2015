that the small dispersion in abundances of \alpha-elements at all ages provides
evidence that the SFH has been uniform throughout the thick disk. In the
context of long time scale infall models, we suggest that this result points
either to a limited dependence of the gas accretion on the Galactic radius in
the inner disk (R<10 kpc), or to a decoupling of the accretion history and star
formation history due to other processes governing the ISM in the early disk,
suggesting that infall cannot be a determining parameter of the chemical
evolution at these epochs. We argue however that these results and other recent
observational constraints -- namely the lack of radial metallicity gradient and
the non-evolving scale length of the thick disk -- are better explained if the
early disk is viewed as a pre-assembled gaseous system, with most of the gas
settled before significant star formation took place -- formally the equivalent
of a closed-box model. In any case, these results point to a weak, or
non-existent inside-out formation history in the thick disk, or in the first
3-5 Gyr of the formation of the Galaxy. We argue however that the growing
importance of an external disk whose chemical properties are distinct from
those of the inner disk would give the impression of an inside-out growth
process when seen through snapshots at different epochs. However, the
progressive, continuous process usually invoked may not have actually existed
in the Milky Way.

intriguing observations are, scale-free correlations in the velocity

distance mediated interactions. Understanding these features, especially, the
origin of fluctuations, appears to be challenging in the current scheme of

self-propelled particle model where neighbourhoods and forces are defined
through topology based rules. The force fluctuations occur spontaneously, and
gives rise to scale-free correlations in the absence of noise and in the

suggest self-organized criticality as a probable route to the existence of

near-Earth asteroid 4179 Toutatis, which was closely observed by Chang'e-2 at a
distance of $770\pm120~$ meters from the asteroid's surface during the outbound
flyby \citep{Huang2013} on 13 December 2012. A sequence of high-resolution
images was acquired during the flyby mission. In combination with ground-based
radar observations collected over the last two decades, we analyze these flyby
images and determine the orientation of the asteroid at the flyby epoch. The
3-1-3 Euler angles of the conversion matrix from the J2000 ecliptic coordinate
system to the body-fixed frame are evaluated to be $-20.1^\circ\pm1^\circ$,
$27.6^\circ\pm1^\circ$ and $42.2^\circ\pm1^\circ$, respectively. The
least-squares method is utilized to determine the rotational parameters and
spin state of Toutatis. The characteristics of the spin-state parameters and
angular momentum variations are extensively studied using numerical
simulations, which confirm those reported by \citet{Takahashi2013}. The large
amplitude of Toutatis' precession is assumed to be responsible for its tumbling
attitude as observed from Earth. Toutatis' angular momentum orientation is
determined to be described by $\lambda_{H}=180.2^{+0.2^\circ}_{-0.3^\circ}$ and
$\beta_{H}=-54.75^{+0.15^\circ}_{-0.10^\circ}$, implying that it has remained
nearly unchanged for two decades. Furthermore, using Fourier analysis to
explore the change in the orientation of Toutatis' axes, we reveal that the two
rotational periods are 5.38 and 7.40 days, respectively, consistent with the
results of the former investigation. Hence, our investigation provides a clear
understanding of the state of the rotational dynamics of Toutatis.

Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). The flux values are obtained through the use of
a Ritz formulation in which we augment the resulting linear system of the
continuous Galerkin (CG) formulation in the higher-order GMsFEM approximation
space. In particular, we impose the finite volume-based restrictions through
incorporating a scalar Lagrange multiplier for each mass conservation
constraint. This approach can be equivalently viewed as a constraint
minimization problem where we minimize the energy functional of the equation
restricted to the subspace of functions that satisfy the desired conservation
properties. To test the performance of the method we consider equations with
heterogeneous permeability coefficients that have high-variation and
discontinuities, and couple the resulting fluxes to a two-phase flow model. The
increase in accuracy associated with the computation of the GMsFEM pressure
solutions is inherited by the flux fields and saturation solutions, and is
closely correlated to the size of the reduced-order systems. In particular, the
addition of more basis functions to the enriched multiscale space produces
solutions that more accurately capture the behavior of the fine scale model. A
variety of numerical examples are offered to validate the performance of the
method.

which we interpret as rotational modulation. A large fraction (28 percent) of B
stars might be classified as ellipsoidal variables, but a statistical argument
suggests that these are probably rotational variables as well. About 8 percent
of the rotational variables have a peculiar periodogram feature which is common
among A stars. The physical cause of this is very likely related to rotation.
The presence of so many rotating variables indicates the presence of star
spots. This suggests that magnetic fields are indeed generated in radiative
stellar envelopes. We find five beta Cep variables, all of which have low
frequencies with relatively large amplitudes. The presence of these frequencies
is a puzzle. About half the stars with high frequencies are cooler than the red
edge of the beta Cep instability strip. These stars do not fit into the general
definition of beta Cep or SPB variables. We have therefore assumed they are
further examples of the anomalous pulsating stars which in the past have been
called ""Maia"" variables. We also examined 300 B stars observed in the K2

that even in upper-level courses, students may be inadequately prepared, have
unclear goals, and have insufficient motivation to excel) as well as the
""paradigm shift"" from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. The framework
is based on empirical investigations demonstrating that the patterns of
reasoning, problem-solving, and self-monitoring difficulties in quantum

classical mechanics are discussed to illustrate how the patterns of
difficulties are analogous as students learn to unpack the respective

parallels between the difficulties in these two knowledge domains can enable
researchers to leverage the extensive literature for introductory physics

$S^k(f)\equiv\{x\in M: \text{ no tangent map at $x$ is }k+1\text{-symmetric}\}$
is $k^{th}$-stratum of the singular set of $f$, then it is well known that
$\dim S^k\leq k$, however little else about the structure of $S^k(f)$ is
understood in any generality. Our first result is for a general stationary
harmonic map, where we prove that $S^k(f)$ is $k$-rectifiable.
  In the case of minimizing harmonic maps we go further, and prove that the
singular set $S(f)$, which is well known to satisfy $\dim S(f)\leq n-3$, is in
fact $n-3$-rectifiable with uniformly {\it finite} $n-3$-measure. An effective
version of this allows us to prove that $|\nabla f|$ has estimates in
$L^3_{weak}$, an estimate which is sharp as $|\nabla f|$ may not live in $L^3$.
  The above results are in fact just applications of a new class of estimates
we prove on the {\it quantitative} stratifications $S^k_{\epsilon,r}(f)$ and
$S^k_{\epsilon}(f)\equiv S^k_{\epsilon,0}(f)$. Roughly,
$S^k_{\epsilon}\subseteq M$ is the collection of points $x\in S^k_\epsilon$ for
which no ball $B_r(x)$ is $\epsilon$-close to being $k+1$-symmetric. We show
that $S^k_\epsilon$ is $k$-rectifiable and satisfies the Minkowski estimate
$Vol(B_r\,S_\epsilon^k)\leq C r^{n-k}$.
  The proofs require a new $L^2$-subspace approximation theorem for stationary
harmonic maps, as well as new $W^{1,p}$-Reifenberg and rectifiable-Reifenberg
type theorems. These results are generalizations of the classical Reifenberg,
and give checkable criteria to determine when a set is $k$-rectifiable with
uniform measure estimates. The new Reifenberg type theorems may be of some
independent interest.

Here, we use an optimised spherical Jeans analysis to reconstruct the

known dSphs. Improvements with respect to previous works are: (i) the use of
more flexible luminosity and anisotropy profiles to minimise biases, (ii) the
use of weak priors tailored on extensive sets of contamination-free mock data
to improve the confidence intervals, (iii) systematic cross-checks of binned
and unbinned analyses on mock and real data, and (iv) the use of mock data
including stellar contamination to test the impact on reconstructed signals.
Our analysis provides updated values for the dark matter content of 8
`classical' and 13 `ultrafaint' dSphs, with the quoted uncertainties directly
linked to the sample size; the more flexible parametrisation we use results in
changes compared to previous calculations. This translates into our ranking of
potentially-brightest and most robust targets---viz., Ursa Minor, Draco,
Sculptor---, and of the more promising, but uncertain targets---viz., Ursa
Major 2, Coma---for annihilating dark matter. Our analysis of Segue 1 is

spatially periodic helical molecular structure is studied experimentally and
modeled numerically. This periodic structure can be seen as a Bragg grating
with a propagation stopband for circularly polarized light. The CLC
nonlinearity can be strengthened by adding absorption dye, thus reducing the
nonlinear intensity threshold and the necessary propagation length. As the
input power increases, a blue shift of the stopband is induced by the
self-defocusing nonlinearity, leading to a substantial enhancement of the
transmission and spreading of the beam. With further increase of the input
power, the self-defocusing nonlinearity saturates, and the beam propagates as
in the linear-diffraction regime. A system of nonlinear couple-mode equations
is used to describe the propagation of the beam. Numerical results agree well
with the experiment findings, suggesting that modulation of intensity and
spatial profile of the beam can be achieved simultaneously under low input
intensities in a compact CLC-based micro-device.

nowadays renewed interest. However, despite the broad applicability and the
extensive study of such models, e.g., in the context of P2P networks, many
fundamental questions regarding their properties and efficiency remain
unanswered. We consider such a service exchange model and analyze the users'
interactions under three different approaches. First, we study a centrally
designed service allocation policy that yields the fair total service each user
should receive based on the service it others to the others. Accordingly, we
consider a competitive market where each user determines selfishly its
allocation policy so as to maximize the service it receives in return, and a
coalitional game model where users are allowed to coordinate their policies. We
prove that there is a unique equilibrium exchange allocation for both game
theoretic formulations, which also coincides with the central fair service
allocation. Furthermore, we characterize its properties in terms of the
coalitions that emerge and the equilibrium allocations, and analyze its
dependency on the underlying network graph. That servicing policy is the
natural reference point to the various mechanisms that are currently proposed
to incentivize user participation and improve the efficiency of such networked
service (or, resource) exchange markets.

survey, the observations and the data analysis techniques developed. We then
present early results from two OSIRIS pointings centred on the cores of the
A901a and A902 clusters. AGN and star-forming (SF) objects are identified using
the [NII]/Halpha vs. W_Halpha (WHAN) diagnostic diagram. The AGN hosts are
brighter, more massive, and possess earlier-type morphologies than SF galaxies.
Both populations tend to be located towards the outskirts of the high density
regions we study. The typical Halpha luminosity of these sources is
significantly lower than that of field galaxies at similar redshifts, but
greater than that found for A1689, a rich cluster at z~0.2. The Halpha
luminosities of our objects translate into star-formation rates (SFRs) between
~0.02 and 6 Msun/yr. Comparing the relationship between stellar mass and
Halpha-derived SFR with that found in the field indicates a suppression of star
formation in the cores of the clusters. These findings agree with previous
investigations of this multi-cluster structure, based on other star formation
indicators, and demonstrate the power of tuneable filters for this kind of
study.

increased mathematical sophistication but also because one must continue to
build on all of the prior knowledge acquired at the introductory and
intermediate levels. In addition, learning quantum mechanics can be especially
challenging because the paradigms of classical mechanics and quantum mechanics
are very different. Here, we review research on student reasoning difficulties
in learning upper-level quantum mechanics and research on students'
problem-solving and metacognitive skills in these courses. Some of these
studies were multi-university investigations. The investigations suggest that
there is large diversity in student performance in upper-level quantum
mechanics regardless of the university, textbook, or instructor and many
students in these courses have not acquired a functional understanding of the
fundamental concepts. The nature of reasoning difficulties in learning quantum
mechanics is analogous to reasoning difficulties found via research in
introductory physics courses. The reasoning difficulties were often due to
over-generalizations of concepts learned in one context to another context
where they are not directly applicable. Reasoning difficulties in
distinguishing between closely related concepts and in making sense of the
formalism of quantum mechanics were common. We conclude with a brief summary of
the research-based approached that take advantage of research on student
difficulties in order to improve teaching and learning of quantum mechanics.

  and the Social Sciences (CSSS) Working Paper No. 143",,,,"stat.AP stat.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  BACKGROUND. Formal demography has a long history of building simple models of
age schedules of demographic quantities, e.g. mortality and fertility rates.
These are widely used in demographic methods to manipulate whole age schedules
using few parameters.
  OBJECTIVE. The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) factorizes a matrix into
three matrices with useful properties including the ability to reconstruct the
original matrix using many fewer, simple matrices. This work demonstrates how
these properties can be exploited to build parsimonious models of whole age
schedules of demographic quantities that can be further parameterized in terms
of arbitrary covariates.
  METHODS. The SVD is presented and explained in detail with attention to
developing an intuitive understanding. The SVD is used to construct a general,
component model of demographic age schedules, and that model is demonstrated
with age-specific mortality and fertility rates. Finally, the model is used (1)
to predict age-specific mortality using HIV indicators and summary measures of
age-specific mortality, and (2) to predict age-specific fertility using the
total fertility rate (TFR).
  RESULTS. The component model of age-specific mortality and fertility rates
succeeds in reproducing the data with two inputs, and acting through those two
inputs, various covariates are able to accurately predict full age schedules.
  CONCLUSIONS. The SVD is potentially useful as a way to summarize, smooth and
model age-specific demographic quantities. The component model is a general
method of relating covariates to whole age schedules.
  COMMENTS. The focus of this work is the SVD and the component model. The
applications are for illustrative purposes only.

dynamic control of the strain gradient with magnitudes far exceeding those

Strain-engineered thin films exhibit extraordinary strain gradients of
$10^5-10^6 m{-1}$ arising from structural relaxation within a short space range

giant, optically initiated dynamic enhancement of the strain gradient, also on
the order of $10^5 -10^6 m^{-1}$, in ferroelectric BiFeO3 epitaxial thin films
via time-dependent coherence analysis of X-ray diffractions. The finding opens
the door for dynamic coupling of the flexoelectric effect with light, making
optical switching of polarization, and thus application such as direct optical
writing of non-volatile ferroelectric memory, possible. A combination of
time-resolved X-ray scattering and optical spectroscopy shows that the
enhancement of the strain gradient is due to a piezoelectric effect driven by a
transient screening electric field, opening the opportunity for new ways of

the interface gradient. The gradient of the level set function represents the
stretching of the interface, which is of critical importance in many physical
applications. The proposed locally gradient-preserving reinitialization (LGPR)
method involves the solution of three PDEs of Hamilton-Jacobi type in
succession; first the signed distance function is found using a traditional
reinitialization technique, then the interface gradient is extended into the
domain by a transport equation, and finally the new level set function is
achieved with the solution of a generalized reinitialization equation. We prove
the well-posedness of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations, with possibly
discontinuous Hamiltonians, and propose numerical schemes for their solutions.
A subcell resolution technique is used in the numerical solution of the
transport equation to extend data away from the interface directly with high
accuracy. The reinitialization technique is computationally inexpensive if the
PDEs are solved only in a small band surrounding the interface. As an important
application, the LGPR method will enable the application of the local level set
approach to the Eulerian Immersed boundary method.

planning problems on planar graphs. For four common time- and distance-based
objectives, we show that the associated path optimization problems for multiple
robots are all NP-complete, even when the underlying graph is planar.
Establishing the computational intractability of optimal multi-robot path
planning problems on planar graphs has important practical implications. In
particular, our result suggests the preferred approach toward solving such
problems, when the number of robots is large, is to augment the planar
environment to reduce the sharing of paths among robots traveling in opposite
directions on those paths. Indeed, such efficiency boosting structures, such as
highways and elevated intersections, are ubiquitous in robotics and

of three-point auto- and cross- correlation. The other is a combination of
third-order one- and two-point cumulants. Both methods deliver accurate bias

the CMB data is significantly affected by the so-called kinetic Doppler
quadrupole (DQ), which is the temperature quadrupole induced by our proper
motion. Assuming our velocity is the dominant contribution to the CMB dipole we
have v/c = beta = (1.231 +/- 0.003) * 10^{-3}, which leads to a non-negligible
DQ of order beta^2. Here we stress that one should properly take into account
that CMB data are usually not presented in true thermodynamic temperature,
which induces a frequency dependent boost correction. The DQ must therefore be
multiplied by a frequency-averaged factor, which we explicitly compute for
several CMB maps finding that it varies between 1.67 and 2.47. This is often
neglected in the literature and turns out to cause a small but non-negligible
difference in the significance levels of some quadrupole-related statistics.
For instance the alignment significance in the SMICA 2013 map goes from
2.3sigma to 3.3sigma, with the frequency dependent DQ, instead of 2.9sigma
ignoring the frequency dependence in the DQ. Moreover as a result of a proper
DQ removal, the agreement across different map-making techniques is improved.

function of temperature, channel radius (3 - 22 nm) and surface chemistry
reveal a competition of radial and axial columnar order. The evolution of the
orientational order parameter of the confined systems is continuous, in
contrast to the discontinuous transition in the bulk. For channel radii larger
than 10 nm we suggest several, alternative defect structures, which are
compatible both with the optical experiments on the collective molecular
orientation presented here and with a translational, radial columnar order
reported in previous diffraction studies. For smaller channel radii our
observations can semi-quantitatively be described by a Landau-de Gennes model
with a nematic shell of radially ordered columns (affected by elastic splay
deformations) that coexists with an orientationally disordered, isotropic core.
For these structures, the cylindrical phase boundaries are predicted to move
from the channel walls to the channel centres upon cooling, and vice-versa upon
heating, in accord with the pronounced cooling/heating hystereses observed and
the scaling behavior of the transition temperatures with channel diameter. The
absence of experimental hints of a paranematic state is consistent with a
biquadratic coupling of the splay deformations to the order parameter.

are calculated to the lowest order in $\left(p_F\ell\right)^{-1}$, where $p_F$
is the Fermi momentum of itinerant electrons and $\ell$ is the mean free path.
We find that i) the first moment of the distribution decays exponentially, and
ii) the variance of the interaction is long-range, however, it becomes
independent of the orientation of the localized magnetic moments due to the
locking between spin and momentum of the electrons that mediate the
interaction. As consequence, long-range magnetic order tends to be suppressed,
and a spin glass phase emerges. The formalism is applied to the surface states
of a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator. The lack of a net magnetic
moment in the glassy phase and the full randomization of spin polarization at
distances larger than $\ell$ excludes a spectral gap for surface states. Hence,
non-magnetic disorder may explain the dispersion in results for photoemission
experiments in magnetically-doped topological insulators.

Mordell--Weil group of a family of abelian varieties over a complex
quasiprojective curve is uniformly bounded in terms of the genus of the curve.
We prove the conjecture for abelian varieties with real multiplication,
uniformly in the field of multiplication. Fixing the field, we furthermore show
that the torsion is bounded in terms of the $\mathit{gonality}$ of the base
curve, which is the closer analog of the arithmetic conjecture. The proof is a
hybrid technique employing both the hyperbolic and algebraic geometry of the
toroidal compactifications of the Hilbert modular varieties $\overline X(1)$
parametrizing such abelian varieties. We show that only finitely many torsion
covers $\overline X_1(\mathfrak{n})$ contain $d$-gonal curves outside of the
boundary for any fixed $d$. We further show the same is true for entire curves
$\mathbb{C}\rightarrow \overline X_1(\mathfrak{n})$.

simulations. Different possibilities for the orientation of the major axis of
the prolate dwarf galaxies are tested, pointing either as close as possible to
the radial direction towards the centre of Andromeda, or tangential to the
radial direction, or with a random angle in the plane that contains the major
axis and the observer. We find that the mean intrinsic axis ratio is ~ 1/2,
with small differences depending on the assumed orientation of the population.
Our deprojections also suggest that a significant fraction of the satellites, ~
10%, are tidally disrupted remnants. We find that there is no evidence of any
obvious difference in the morphology and major axis orientation between
satellites that belong to the vast thin plane of co-rotating galaxies around
Andromeda and those that do not belong to this structure.

$^{13}$CO/$^{12}$CO ratios, but Virgo cluster and group galaxies preferentially
show a $^{13}$CO/$^{12}$CO ratio about 2 times larger than field galaxies,

this variation could be caused by (i) the extra enrichment of gas from
molecular reprocessing occurring in low-mass stars (boosting the abundance of
$^{13}$C to $^{12}$C in the absence of external gas accretion), (ii) much
higher pressure being exerted on the midplane gas (by the intracluster medium)
in the cluster environment than in isolated galaxies, or (iii) all but the

deceleration of their relativistic jets, the beaming angle becomes comparable
to the viewing angle. Orphan Afterglows (OA) should outnumber the current

the population of orphan afterglows in the mm, optical and X-ray bands through
a population synthesis code of GRBs and the standard afterglow emission model.
We estimate the detection rate of OA by on-going and forthcoming surveys. The
average duration of OA as transients above a given limiting flux is derived and
described with analytical expressions: in general OA should appear as daily
transients in optical surveys and as monthly/yearly transients in the mm/radio

OA yr^-1 could be observed by the ZTF survey. A larger number of 50 OA yr^-1
should be detected by LSST in the optical band. For the X-ray band, ~ 26 OA

detectable by LSST, the X-ray and optical follow up of the light curve (for the

Hubble recession, gravitational redshift and peculiar velocity. The line of
sight distance to a galaxy inferred from redshift is affected by the peculiar
velocity component of galaxy redshift, which is observed as an anisotropy in
the correlation function. This anisotropy allows us to measure the linear
growth rate of matter ($f\sigma_8$). We measure the $f\sigma_8$ at $z=0.57$
using the CMASS sample from Data Release 11 of Sloan Digital Sky Survey III
(SDSS III) Baryon Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). The galaxy sample
consists of 690,826 massive galaxies in the redshift range 0.43-0.7 covering
8498 deg$^2$. Here we report the first simultaneous measurement of $f\sigma_8$
and background cosmological parameters using Convolution Lagrangian
Perturbation Theory (CLPT) with Gaussian streaming model (GSRSD). We arrive at
a constraint of $f\sigma_8=0.462\pm0.041$ (9\% accuracy) at effective redshift
($\bar{z}=0.57$) when we include Planck CMB likelihood while marginalizing over
all other cosmological parameters. We also measure $b\sigma_8=1.19\pm0.03$,
$H(z=0.57)=89.2\pm3.6$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $D_A(z=0.57)=1401\pm23$ Mpc.
Our analysis also improves the constraint on $\Omega_c h^2=0.1196\pm0.0009$ by
a factor of 3 when compared to the Planck only measurement($\Omega_c h^2=0.1196
\pm 0.0031$). Our results are consistent with Planck $\Lambda$CDM-GR prediction
and all other CMASS measurements, even though our theoretical models are fairly
different. This consistency suggests that measurement of $f\sigma_8$ from
Redshift space distortions at multiple redshifts will be a sensitive probe of
the theory of gravity that is largely model independent, allowing us to place
model-independent constraints on alternative models of gravity.

during inflation. This gives a novel dark-matter production mechanism quite
distinct from misalignment or thermal production. While scalars and tensors are
typically produced with a nearly scale-invariant spectrum, surprisingly the
vector is produced with a power spectrum peaked at intermediate wavelengths.
Thus dangerous, long-wavelength, isocurvature perturbations are suppressed.
Further, at long wavelengths the vector inherits the usual adiabatic, nearly
scale-invariant perturbations of the inflaton, allowing it to be a good dark
matter candidate. The final abundance can be calculated precisely from the mass
and the Hubble scale of inflation, H_I. Saturating the dark matter abundance we
find a prediction for the mass m = 10^-5 eV (10^14 GeV/H_I)^4. High-scale
inflation, potentially observable in the CMB, motivates an exciting mass range
for recently proposed direct detection experiments for hidden photon dark
matter. Such experiments may be able to reconstruct the distinctive, peaked
power spectrum, verifying that the dark matter was produced by quantum
fluctuations during inflation and providing a direct measurement of the scale
of inflation. Thus a detection would not only be the discovery of dark matter,

structure of the SMC. Three trends were observed for the ordered magnetic field
direction at position angles of $(65 \pm 10)$ deg, $(115 \pm 10)$ deg, and
$(150 \pm 10)$ deg. Our results suggest the existence of an ordered magnetic
field aligned with the Magellanic Bridge direction and SMC's Bar in the NE

respectively. However, the overall magnetic field structure is fairly complex.
The trends at $115$ deg and $150$ deg may be correlated with the SMC's bimodal
structure, observed in Cepheids' distances and HI velocities. We derived a
value of $B_{sky} = (0.947 \pm 0.079)~\mu G$ for the ordered sky-projected

of $\sim10$) than the line-of-sight field derived from Faraday rotation

agrees with observed estimates for other irregular and spiral galaxies. For the

only classical information reaches the macroscopic observer and through which
different observers can agree on the objective existence of such object, has
been revived lately for several types of situations, successfully explaining
classicality. We explore quantum Darwinism in the setting of an environment
made of two level systems which are initially prepared in the ground state of
the XX model, which exhibits different phases; we find that the different
phases have different ability to redundantly acquire classical information
about the system, being the ""ferromagnetic phase"" the only one able to complete
quantum Darwinism. At the same time we relate this ability to how non-Markovian
the system dynamics is, based on the interpretation that non-Markovian dynamics
is associated to back flow of information from environment to system, thus
spoiling the information transfer needed for Darwinism. Finally, we explore
mixing of bath registers by allowing a small interaction among them, finding

in Leccardi & Molendi (2008) and Baldi et al. (2012). We use the pseudo-entropy
ratio to separate the Cool-Core (CC) cluster population, where the central gas
density tends to be relatively higher, cooler and more metal rich, from the
Non-Cool-Core systems. The average, redshift-independent, metal abundance
measured in the 3 radial bins decrease moving outwards, with a mean metallicity
in the core that is even 3 (two) times higher than the value of 0.16 times the
solar abundance in Anders & Grevesse (1989) estimated at r>0.4 R500 in CC (NCC)
objects. We find that the values of the emission-weighted metallicity are
well-fitted by the relation $Z(z) = Z_0 (1+z)^{-\gamma}$ at given radius. A
significant scatter, intrinsic to the observed distribution and of the order of
0.05-0.15, is observed below 0.4 R500. The nominal best-fit value of $\gamma$
is significantly different from zero in the inner cluster regions ($\gamma =
1.6 \pm 0.2$) and in CC clusters only. These results are confirmed also with a
bootstrap analysis, which provides a still significant negative evolution in
the core of CC systems (P>99.9 per cent). No redshift-evolution is observed
when regions above the core (r > 0.15 R500) are considered. A reasonable good
fit of both the radial and redshift dependence is provided from the functional

the magnon scattering is dominated by an emerging magnetic field whose flux

asymmetric and oscillating differential cross section. We demonstrate that the
transversal momentum transfer to the skyrmion is universal due to the

three different feedback scenarios: one model with purely ejective feedback,
one model with ejective feedback with reincorporation of ejected gas, and one

Compared with current observational data, the model implementing preventative

Simultaneously the potential slows ions entering the exhaust below the

motivated by applications to interpolation and quadrature, can be traced back
at least to the 1970s. Empirical study has shown consistently that Vandermonde
matrices tend to be badly ill-conditioned, with a narrow class of notable
exceptions, such as the matrices of the discrete Fourier transform (hereafter
referred to as DFT). So far formal support for this empirical observation,
however, has been limited to the matrices defined by the real set of knots. We
prove that, more generally, any Vandermonde matrix of a large size is badly
ill-conditioned unless its knots are more or less equally spaced on or about
the circle $C(0,1)=\{x:\,|x|=1\}$. The matrices of DFT are perfectly
conditioned, being defined by a cyclic sequence of knots, equally spaced on
that circle, but we prove that even a slight modification of the knots into the
so called quasi-cyclic sequence on this circle defines badly ill-conditioned
Vandermonde matrices. Likewise we prove that the half-size leading block of a
large DFT matrix is badly ill-conditioned. (This result was motivated by an
application to pre-conditioning of an input matrix for Gaussian elimination
with no pivoting.) Our analysis involves the Ekkart--Young theorem, the
Vandermonde-to-Cauchy transformation of matrix structure, our new inversion
formula for a Cauchy matrix, and low-rank approximation of its large
submatrices.

searched for period spacing patterns in the photometric data and identified
this diagnostic for 50 of the stars in the sample, 46 of which are single stars

approach include sample surveys, sample registration systems, health and

health facility records and others.
  We propose a new statistical framework for gathering health and population
data - Hyak - that leverages the benefits of sampling and longitudinal,
prospective surveillance to create a cheap, accurate, sustainable monitoring
platform. Hyak has three fundamental components:
  1) Data Amalgamation: a sampling and surveillance component that organizes
two or more data collection systems to work together: a) data from HDSS with
frequent, intense, linked, prospective follow-up and b) data from sample
surveys conducted in large areas surrounding the Health and Demographic
Surveillance System sites using informed sampling so as to capture as many
events as possible;
  2) Cause of Death: verbal autopsy to characterize the distribution of deaths
by cause at the population level; and
  3) SES: measurement of socioeconomic status in order to characterize poverty
and wealth.
  We conduct a simulation study of the informed sampling component of Hyak
based on the Agincourt HDSS site in South Africa. Compared to traditional
cluster sampling, Hyak's informed sampling captures more deaths, and when
combined with an estimation model that includes spatial smoothing, produces
estimates mortality that have lower variance and small bias.

In general, batch RL techniques do not rely on expert knowledge on the system
dynamics or the solution. However, if some expert knowledge is provided, it can
be incorporated by using our novel policy adjustment method. Finally, we tackle
the challenge of finding an open-loop schedule required to participate in the
day-ahead market. We propose a model-free Monte-Carlo estimator method that
uses a metric to construct artificial trajectories and we illustrate this
method by finding the day-ahead schedule of a heat-pump thermostat. Our

the spherically averaged density profile of dark matter haloes has a shape that
depends on the power spectrum of matter perturbations. Density profiles are
steeper in WDM but become shallower at scales less than one percent of the
virial radius. Virialization isotropizes the velocity dispersion in the inner
regions of the halo but does not erase the memory of the initial conditions in
phase space. The location of the observed deviations from CDM in the density
profile and in phase space can be directly related to the ratio between the
halo mass and the filtering mass and are most evident in small mass haloes,
even for a 34 keV thermal relic WDM. The rearrangement of mass within the

of evidence suggesting that quantum correlations in non-entangled, mixed states
may constitute a useful resource to implement non trivial information related
tasks. Here we conduct a systematic exploration of the aforementioned effect
for particular families of states of quantum systems of low dimensionality
(three qubits states). In order to assess the non-classicality of the
correlations of the reduced states we use an indicator of quantum correlations
based upon the state disturbances generated by the measurement of local
observables. We show, for a three-qubit system, that there exists a
relationship between the classical mutual information of the original
classically correlated states and the maximum quantum correlation exhibited by
the reduced states.

estimates in developing world settings where vital registration does not
function well. VAs assign cause(s) to a death by using information describing
the events leading up to the death, provided by care givers. Typically
physicians read VA interviews and assign causes using their expert knowledge.
Physician coding is often slow, and individual physicians bring bias to the
coding process that results in non-comparable cause assignments. These problems
significantly limit the utility of physician-coded VAs. A solution to both is
to use an algorithmic approach that formalizes the cause-assignment process.
This ensures that assigned causes are comparable and requires many fewer
person-hours so that cause assignment can be conducted quickly without
disrupting the normal work of physicians. Peter Byass' InterVA method is the
most widely used algorithmic approach to VA coding and is aligned with the WHO
2012 standard VA questionnaire.
  The statistical model underpinning InterVA can be improved; uncertainty needs
to be quantified, and the link between the population-level CSMFs and the
individual-level cause assignments needs to be statistically rigorous.
Addressing these theoretical concerns provides an opportunity to create new
software using modern languages that can run on multiple platforms and will be
widely shared. Building on the overall framework pioneered by InterVA, our work
creates a statistical model for automated VA cause assignment.

out-of-equilibrium interacting nanoelectronics systems. It allows one to
systematically compute the expansion of any physical observable (such as
current or density) in powers of the electron-electron interaction coupling
constant $U$. It is based on the out-of-equilibrium Keldysh Green's function
formalism in real-time and corresponds to evaluating all the Feynman diagrams
to a given order $U^n$ (up to $n=15$ in the present work). A key idea is to
explicitly sum over the Keldysh indices in order to enforce the unitarity of
the time evolution. The method can easily reach long time, stationary regimes,
even at zero temperature. We then illustrate our approach with an application
to the Anderson model, an archetype interacting mesoscopic system. We recover
various results of the literature such as the spin susceptibility or the ""Kondo
ridge"" in the current-voltage characteristics. In this case, we found the
Monte-Carlo free of the sign problem even at zero temperature, in the
stationary regime and in absence of particle-hole symmetry. The main limitation
of the method is the lack of convergence of the expansion in $U$ for large $U$,
i.e. a mathematical property of the model rather than a limitation of the
Monte-Carlo algorithm. Standard extrapolation methods of divergent series can
be used to evaluate the series in the strong correlation regime.

high-level science applications for data discovery, integration, analysis, and
catalog cross-comparison. Working with the international community, and based
on the experience from the software development, the VAO was a major
contributor to international standards within the International Virtual
Observatory Alliance. The VAO also demonstrated how an operational virtual
observatory could be deployed, providing a robust operational environment in
which VO services worldwide were routinely checked for aliveness and compliance
with international standards. Finally, the VAO engaged in community outreach,
developing a comprehensive web site with on-line tutorials, announcements,
links to both U.S. and internationally developed tools and services, and
exhibits and hands-on training .... All digital products of the VAO Project,
including software, documentation, and tutorials, are stored in a repository

expectation that new telescopes and facilities incorporate VO capabilities
during the design of their data management systems.

flow converges, triggering star formation in the post-shock layer. We include
turbulence and self-gravity, applying sink particle techniques, and explore a
range of inflow Mach number ${\cal M}=2-16$. Two sets of cores are identified
and compared: $t_1$-cores are identified of a time snapshot in each simulation,
representing dense structures in a single cloud map; $t_\mathrm{coll}$-cores
are identified at their individual time of collapse, representing the initial
mass reservoir for accretion. We find that cores and filaments form and evolve
at the same time. At the stage of core collapse, there is a well-defined,
converged characteristic mass for isothermal fragmentation that is comparable
to the critical Bonner-Ebert mass at the post-shock pressure. The core mass
functions (CMFs) of $t_\mathrm{coll}$-cores show a deficit of high-mass cores
($\gtrsim 7M_\odot$) compared to the observed stellar initial mass function
(IMF). However, the CMFs of $t_1$-cores are similar to the observed CMFs and
include many low-mass cores that are gravitationally stable. The difference
between $t_1$-cores and $t_\mathrm{coll}$-cores suggests that the full sample
from observed CMFs may not evolve into protostars. Individual sink particles
accrete at a roughly constant rate throughout the simulations, gaining one
$t_\mathrm{coll}$-core mass per free-fall time even after the initial mass
reservoir is accreted. High-mass sinks gain proportionally more mass at late
times than low-mass sinks. There are outbursts in accretion rates, resulting

using ""inflated"" output covariances (observation models). To estimate the
inflated covariances, we propose a novel cross validation method to remove
""outliers"" from the normal ADL that serve as proxies for the unseen falls and
allow learning the XHMMs using only normal activities. We tested the proposed
XHMM approaches on two activity recognition datasets and show high detection
rates for falls in the absence of fall-specific training data. We show that the
traditional method of choosing a threshold based on maximum of negative of
log-likelihood to identify unseen falls is ill-posed for this problem. We also
show that supervised classification methods perform poorly when very limited

maximization, subject to constraints. We give results on adaptivity gaps, and
on the gap between the optimal offline and online solutions. We present a
procedure that transforms a decision tree (adaptive algorithm) into a
non-adaptive chain. We prove that this chain achieves at least ${\tau}$ times
the utility of the decision tree, over a product distribution and binary state
space, where ${\tau} = \min_{i,j} \Pr[x_i=j]$. This proves an adaptivity gap of
$1/{\tau}$ (which is $2$ in the case of a uniform distribution) for the problem
of stochastic monotone submodular maximization subject to state-independent
constraints. For a cardinality constraint, we prove that a simple adaptive
greedy algorithm achieves an approximation factor of $(1-1/e^{\tau})$ with
respect to the optimal offline solution; previously, it has been proven that
the algorithm achieves an approximation factor of $(1-1/e)$ with respect to the
optimal adaptive online solution. Finally, we show that there exists a
non-adaptive solution for the stochastic max coverage problem that is within a

thermodynamic integration. This connection provides a way to systematically
construct a local mean force in order to optimally approximate the potential of
mean force through force matching. We introduce a generalized force matching

Furthermore, we study the equivalence of force matching with relative entropy
minimization which we derive for general non-linear coarse graining maps. We

is to determine the distances in the symmetric group $\Sym_n$ with respect to a

consists of block transpositions. It should be noted that ""the block
transposition distance of a permutation"" is the distance of the permutation
from the identity permutation in the Cayley graph $\Cay$, and ""sorting a
permutation by block transpositions"" is equivalent to finding shortest paths in
$\Cay$. The original results in our thesis concern the lower and upper bounds
on the block transpositions diameter of $\Sym_n$ with respect to $S_n$ and the

the toric equivalence can be obtained bijective maps on $\Sym_n$ that we call
\emph{toric maps}. Using the properties of the toric maps, we discuss the role
of the invariance principle of the block transposition distance within toric

$\Aut(\Cay)$ is the product of the right translation group by
$\textsf{N}\rtimes\textsf{D}_{n+1}$, where $\textsf{N}$ is the subgroup fixing

cyclic subgroup is generated by the toric maps. Computer aided computation
supports our conjecture that $\textsf{N}$ is trivial. Also, we prove that the

notably $\Gamma$ has as many as $n+1$ maximal cliques of size $2$, its subgraph

transition to hydrodynamic behavior (at $\tau_s \approx$ 0.13 fm/$c$) ,
followed by hydrodynamic evolution with a larger specific shear viscosity

evolution with $\eta/s\approx$ 0.16. These new results including
pre-equilibrium evolution are compared to fits without a pre-equilbrium stage

frequency-swept emission mimics the dispersion of an astrophysical pulse that
has propagated through tenuous cold plasma. In fact, their similarity to FRB
010724 had previously cast a shadow over the interpretation of ""fast radio
bursts,"" which otherwise appear to be of extragalactic origin. Until now, the
physical origin of the dispersion-mimicking perytons had remained a mystery. We
have identified strong out-of-band emission at 2.3--2.5 GHz associated with
several peryton events. Subsequent tests revealed that a peryton can be
generated at 1.4 GHz when a microwave oven door is opened prematurely and the
telescope is at an appropriate relative angle. Radio emission escaping from
microwave ovens during the magnetron shut-down phase neatly explain all of the
observed properties of the peryton signals. Now that the peryton source has
been identified, we furthermore demonstrate that the microwaves on site could
not have caused FRB 010724. This and other distinct observational differences
show that FRBs are excellent candidates for genuine extragalactic transients.

between quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and transmission resonance (TR) peaks in the
transmission spectrum of one-dimensional (1D) and quasi-1D open disordered
systems. It is shown that for weak disorder there exist two types of the
eigenstates: ordinary QNMs which are associated with a TR, and hidden QNMs
which do not exhibit peaks in transmission or within the sample. The
distinctive feature of the hidden modes is that unlike ordinary ones, their
lifetimes remain constant in a wide range of the strength of disorder. In this
range, the averaged ratio of the number of transmission peaks $N_{\rm res}$ to
the number of QNMs $N_{\rm mod}$, $N_{\rm res}/N_{\rm mod}$, is insensitive to
the type and degree of disorder and is close to the value $\sqrt{2/5}$, which
we derive analytically in the weak-scattering approximation. The physical
nature of the hidden modes is illustrated in simple examples with a few
scatterers. The analogy between ordinary and hidden QNMs and the segregation of
superradiant states and trapped modes is discussed. When the coupling to the
environment is tuned by an external edge reflectors, the superradiace
transition is reproduced. Hidden modes have been also found in microwave
measurements in quasi-1D open disordered samples. The microwave measurements
and modal analysis of transmission in the crossover to localization in quasi-1D
systems give a ratio of $N_{\rm res}/N_{\rm mod}$ close to $\sqrt{2/5}$. In
diffusive quasi-1D samples, however, $N_{\rm res}/N_{\rm mod}$ falls as the
effective number of transmission eigenchannels $M$ increases. Once $N_{\rm
mod}$ is divided by $M$, however, the ratio $N_{\rm res}/N_{\rm mod}$ is close
to the ratio found in 1D.

of a new form of the Segal-Bargmann-Hall ""coherent state"" transform for compact

evidence for $G=SU(2)$. The reason for conjoining this conjecture with the main
topic of this article originates in the observation, that the coherent state
transform can be used as a basic building block of a coherent state
quantisation (Berezin quantisation) for compact Lie groups $G$. But, as Weyl
and Berezin quantisation for $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ are intimately related by heat
kernel evolution, it is natural to ask, whether a similar connection exists for
compact Lie groups, as well. Moreover, since the formulation of space adiabatic
perturbation theory requires a (deformation) quantisation as minimal input, we
analyse the question to what extent the coherent state quantisation, defined by
the Segal-Bargmann-Hall transform, can serve as basis of the former.

phenomena in the universe. The energy release and particle acceleration during
reconnection have been proposed as a mechanism for producing high-energy
emissions and cosmic rays. We carry out two- and three-dimensional kinetic
simulations to investigate relativistic magnetic reconnection and the
associated particle acceleration. The simulations focus on electron-positron
plasmas starting with a magnetically dominated, force-free current sheet
($\sigma \equiv B^2/(4\pi n_e m_e c^2) \gg 1$). For this limit, we demonstrate
that relativistic reconnection is highly efficient at accelerating particles
through a first-order Fermi process accomplished by the curvature drift of
particles along the electric field induced by the relativistic flows. This
mechanism gives rise to the formation of hard power-law spectra $f \propto
(\gamma-1)^{-p}$ and approaches $p = 1$ for sufficiently large $\sigma$ and
system size. Eventually most of the available magnetic free energy is converted
into nonthermal particle kinetic energy. An analytic model is presented to
explain the key results and predict a general condition for the formation of
power-law distributions. The development of reconnection in these regimes leads
to relativistic inflow and outflow speeds and enhanced reconnection rates
relative to non-relativistic regimes. In the three-dimensional simulation, the
interplay between secondary kink and tearing instabilities leads to strong
magnetic turbulence, but does not significantly change the energy conversion,
reconnection rate, or particle acceleration. This study suggests that
relativistic reconnection sites are strong sources of nonthermal particles,
which may have important implications to a variety of high-energy astrophysical
problems.

results are optimal decay estimates and the propagation of global bounds for

dimension 4 or greater, it suffices to use the standard vector fields commuting

such that these vector fields would generate a logarithmic loss. Instead, we
construct modified vector fields where the modification depends on the solution

X-ray radiation by super-strong magnetic fields as high as $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ G.
However, no direct evidence for such strong fields is obtained till now, and
the recent discovery of low magnetic field magnetars even indicates that some
more efficient radiation mechanism than magnetic dipole radiation should be
included. In this paper, quantum vacuum friction (QVF) is suggested to be a
direct consequence of super-strong {\em surface} fields, therefore the magnetar
model could then be tested further through the QVF braking. Pulsars' high
surface magnetic field interacting with the quantum vacuum result in a
significantly high spindown rate ($\dot{P}$). It is found that QVF dominates
the energy loss of pulsars when pulsar's rotation period and its first
derivative satisfy the relationship $P^3\cdot
\dot{P}>0.63\times10^{-16}\xi^{-4}$s$^2$, where $\xi$ is the ratio of the
surface magnetic field over diploe magnetic field. In the ""QVF $+$
magnetodipole"" joint braking scenario, the spindown behavior of magnetars
should be quite different from that in the pure magnetodipole model. We are
expecting these results could be tested by magnetar candidates, especially the
low magnetic field ones, in the future.

is one of the central problems of condensed matter physics. Recent progress in
ultracold atom experiments makes it possible to control this dynamics by
coupling an artificial gauge field specifically to the impurity. In this paper,
we consider a narrow toroidal trap in which a Fermi gas is interacting with a
single atom. We show that an external magnetic field coupled to the impurity is
a versatile tool to probe the impurity dynamics. Using Bethe Ansatz (BA) we
calculate the eigenstates and corresponding energies exactly as a function of
the flux through the trap. Adiabatic change of flux connects the ground state
to excited states due to flux quantization. For repulsive interactions, the
impurity disturbs the Fermi sea by dragging the fermions whose momentum matches
the flux. This drag transfers momentum from the impurity to the background and
increases the effective mass. The effective mass saturates to the total mass of
the system for infinitely repulsive interactions. For attractive interactions,
the drag again increases the effective mass which quickly saturates to twice
the mass of a single particle as a polaron of the impurity and one fermion is
formed. For excited states with momentum comparable to number of particles,
effective mass shows a resonant behavior. We argue that standard tools in cold
atom experiments can be used to test these predictions.

feedback-driven bipolar active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets. Condensation of cold
gas, and the consequent enhanced accretion, is required for AGN feedback to
balance radiative cooling with reasonable efficiencies, and to match the
observed cool core properties. A feedback efficiency (mechanical luminosity
$\approx \epsilon \dot{M}_{\rm acc} c^2$; where $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ is the mass
accretion rate at 1 kpc) as small as $5 \times 10^{-5}$ is sufficient to reduce
the cooling/accretion rate by $\sim 10$ compared to a pure cooling flow. This
value is smaller compared to the ones considered earlier, and is consistent
with the jet efficiency and the fact that only a small fraction of gas at 1 kpc
is accreted on to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). We find hysteresis cycles
in all our simulations with cold mode feedback: {\em condensation} of cold gas
when the ratio of the cooling-time to the free-fall time ($t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm
ff}$) is $\lesssim 10$ leads to a sudden enhancement in the accretion rate; a
large accretion rate causes strong jets and {\em overheating} of the hot ICM
such that $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff} > 10$; further condensation of cold gas is
suppressed and the accretion rate falls, leading to slow cooling of the core
and condensation of cold gas, restarting the cycle. Therefore, there is a
spread in core properties, such as the jet power, accretion rate, for the same
value of core entropy or $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$. A fewer number of cycles
are observed for higher efficiencies and for lower mass halos because the core
is overheated to a longer cooling time. The 3-D simulations show the formation
of a few-kpc scale, rotationally-supported, massive ($\sim 10^{11} M_\odot$)
cold gas torus. (abstract abridged)

practicable strategy currently to probe the neutron skin thickness of
$^{208}$Pb based on a high linear correlation between the $\Delta R_{np}$ and
$J-a_{\text{sym}}$, where $J$ and $a_{\text{sym}}$ are the symmetry energy
(coefficient) of nuclear matter at saturation density and of $^{208}$Pb. An
accurate $J-a_{\text{sym}}$ thus places a strong constraint on the $\Delta

PREX, the reliably experimental information on the $J-a_{\text{sym}}$ is much
more easily available attributed to a wealth of measured data on nuclear masses
and on decay energies. The density dependence of the symmetry energy is also
well constrained with the $J-a_{\text{sym}}$. Finally, with a `tomoscan'
method, we find that one just needs to measure the nucleon densities in

experiment are reported. $E$ ($G$) was measured using circularly (linearly)
polarised photons and a longitudinally polarised target. $E$ was measured over
the photon energy range from close to threshold ($E_\gamma = 1108$~MeV) to
$E_\gamma = 2300$~MeV and $G$ at a single energy interval of $1108 < E_\gamma
<1300$~MeV. Both measurements cover the full solid angle. The observables $E$
and $G$ are highly sensitive to the contribution of baryon resonances, with $E$
acting as a helicity filter in the $s$-channel. The new results indicate
significant $s$-channel resonance contributions together with contributions
from $t$-channel exchange processes. A partial wave analysis reveals strong
contributions from the partial waves with spin-parity $J^P=3/2^+, 5/2^+$, and

semiclassical-initial value representation (LSC-IVR or classical Wigner
approximation) results in a classical dynamics which conserves the quantum
Boltzmann distribution. We rederive the (standard) LSC-IVR approach by writing
the (exact) quantum time-correlation function in terms of the normal modes of a
free ring-polymer (i.e. a discrete imaginary-time Feynman path), taking the
limit that the number of polymer beads $N \to \infty$, such that the lowest
normal-mode frequencies take their Matsubara values. The change we propose is
to truncate the quantum Liouvillian, not explicitly in powers of $\hbar^2$ at
$\hbar^0$ (which gives back the standard LSC-IVR approximation), but in the
normal-mode derivatives corresponding to the lowest Matsubara frequencies. The
resulting Matsubara dynamics is inherently classical (since all terms
$\mathcal{O}\left(\hbar^{2}\right)$ disappear from the Matsubara Liouvillian in
the limit $N \to \infty$), and conserves the quantum Boltzmann distribution
because the Matsubara Hamiltonian is symmetric with respect to imaginary-time
translation. Numerical tests show that the Matsubara approximation to the
quantum time-correlation function converges with respect to the number of
modes, and gives better agreement than LSC- IVR with the exact quantum result.
Matsubara dynamics is too computationally expensive to be applied to complex
systems, but its further approximation may lead to practical methods.

intensively studied and a number of applications have been developed. However,
the typical micro- & anno- fibers are usually free-standing or positioned on a

guiding mode. Here we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the
possibility of confining light within a microfiber on a high refractive index
substrate. In contrast to the strong leaky to the substrate, we found that the
radiation loss was dependent on the radius of microfiber and the refractive
index contrast. Consequently, quasi-guiding modes could be formed and the light
could propagate and be amplified in such systems. By fabricating tapered silica
fiber and dye-doped polymer fiber and placing them on sapphire substrates, the
light propagation, amplification, and laser behaviors have been experimentally
studied to verify the quasi-guiding modes in microfer with higher index

of two important dynamical bar parameters, bar strength and bar pattern speed,
on the shape of the bar dust lanes. To quantify the shape of the dust lanes we
have developed a new systematic method to measure the dust lane curvature.
Previous numerical simulations have compared the curvature of bar dust lanes
with the bar strength, predicting a relation between both parameters which has
been supported by observational studies but with a large spread. We take into
account the bar pattern speed to explore, simultaneously, the effect of both
parameters on the dust lane shape. To that end, we separate our galactic bars
in fast bars $\left(1 < \mathcal{R} < 1.4 \right)$ and slow bars
$\left(\mathcal{R} > 1.4 \right)$, obtaining, as previous simulations, an
inverse relation between the dust lane curvature and the bar strength for fast
bars. For the first time, we extend the study to slow bars, finding a constant
curvature as a function of the bar strength. As a result, we conclude that weak
bars with straight dust lanes are candidates for slow bars. Finally, we have
analysed a pilot sample of ten S$^4$G galaxies, obtaining dust lane curvatures
lying within the range covered by the simulations.

explored by varying the dimensionless strain rate parameter $Sk_0/\epsilon_0$

probability density functions for both passive and inertial particles. A high
mean strain is found to have a significant effect on the acceleration variance
both directly, through an increase in wave number magnitude, and indirectly,
through the coupling of the fluctuating velocity and the mean flow field. The
influence of the strain on normalized particle acceleration pdfs is more
subtle. For the case of passive particle we can approximate the acceleration
variance with the aid of rapid distortion theory and obtain good agreement with
simulation data. For the case of inertial particles we can write a formal
expressions for the accelerations. The magnitude changes in the inertial
particle acceleration variance and the effect on the probability density

half-duplex relays, and a destination, only one relay is active at any given
time, i.e., only one relay receives or transmits, and the other relays are
inactive, i.e., they do not receive nor transmit. The capacity of this network,
when all links are affected by independent slow time-continuous fading and
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), is still unknown, and only achievable
average rates have been reported in the literature so far. In this paper, we
present new achievable average rates for this network which are larger than the
best known average rates. These new average rates are achieved with a
buffer-aided relaying protocol. Since the developed buffer-aided protocol
introduces unbounded delay, we also devise a buffer-aided protocol which limits
the delay at the expense of a decrease in rate. Moreover, we discuss the
practical implementation of the proposed buffer-aided relaying protocols and
show that they do not require more resources for channel state information
acquisition than the existing relay selection protocols.

PDE-constrained optimization problems. The goal, then, is to infer the
parameters, typically coefficients of the PDE, from partial measurements of the
solutions of the PDE for several right-hand-sides. Such PDE-constrained
problems can be solved by finding a stationary point of the Lagrangian, which
entails simultaneously updating the paramaters and the (adjoint) state
variables. For large-scale problems, such an all-at-once approach is not
feasible as it requires storing all the state variables. In this case one
usually resorts to a reduced approach where the constraints are explicitly
eliminated (at each iteration) by solving the PDEs. These two approaches, and
variations thereof, are the main workhorses for solving PDE-constrained
optimization problems arising from inverse problems. In this paper, we present
an alternative method that aims to combine the advantages of both approaches.
Our method is based on a quadratic penalty formulation of the constrained
optimization problem. By eliminating the state variable, we develop an
efficient algorithm that has roughly the same computational complexity as the
conventional reduced approach while exploiting a larger search space. Numerical
results show that this method indeed reduces some of the non-linearity of the
problem and is less sensitive the initial iterate.

their nontrivial topology, the skyrmion Hall effect might be a roadblock for
practical applications since any longitudinal motions of skyrmions in nanotrack
is accompanied by a transverse motion. A direct consequence of such an effect
is easy destruction of skyrmions at the nanotrack edges during their fast
motions along the nanotrack, despite their topological protection. Here we
propose an entirely novel solution of completely inhibiting such skyrmion Hall
effect without affecting its topological properties based on a
antiferromagnetic-coupling bilayer system. We show that a pair of magnetic
skyrmions can be nucleated in such a bilayer system through vertical current
injection or converted from a current-driven domain-wall pair. Once nucleated,
the skyrmion pair can be displaced through current-induced spin torque either
from a vertical injected current or in-plane current. The skyrmion Hall effect
is completely suppressed due to the cancellation of back-action forces acting
on each individual skyrmion, resulting in a straight and fast motion of
skyrmions along the current direction. This proposal will be of fundamental
interests by introducing the bilayer degree of freedom into the system.
Moreover, it provides an easy way to engineer the transport properties of the
skyrmionic devices to achieve desired performance, making it highly promising
for practical applications such as ultradense memory and information-processing
devices based on skyrmions.

an excellent experimental playground to study exotic phenomena related to the
phase of the order parameter. Not only the complex structure of unconventional
order parameters have an impact on the Josephson effects, but also may
profoundly alter the quasi-particle excitation spectrum near a junction. Here,
by using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we visualize the
spatial evolution of the local density of states (LDOS) near twin boundaries
(TBs) of the nodal superconductor FeSe. The $\pi/2$ rotation of the
crystallographic orientation across the TB twists the structure of the
unconventional order parameter, which may, in principle, bring about a
zero-energy LDOS peak at the TB. The LDOS at the TB observed in our study, in
contrast, does not exhibit any signature of a zero-energy peak and an apparent
gap amplitude remains finite all the way across the TB. The low-energy
quasiparticle excitations associated with the gap nodes are affected by the TB
over a distance more than an order of magnitude larger than the coherence
length $\xi_{ab}$. The modification of the low-energy states is even more
prominent in the region between two neighboring TBs separated by a distance
$\approx7\xi_{ab}$. In this region the spectral weight near the Fermi level
($\approx\pm$0.2~meV) due to the nodal quasiparticle spectrum is almost
completely removed. These behaviors suggest that the TB induces a fully-gapped
state, invoking a possible twist of the order parameter structure which breaks
time-reversal symmetry.

registry, has been rebuilt to record more policy detail and provide more
extensive search functionality. Deposit rates were measured for articles in
institutions' repositories and compared to the total number of WoS-indexed
articles published from those institutions. Average deposit rate was over four
times as high for institutions with a mandatory policy. Six positive
correlations were found between deposit rates and (1) Must-Deposit; (2)
Cannot-Waive-Deposit; (3) Deposit-Linked-to-Research-Evaluation; (4)
Cannot-Waive-Rights-Retention; (5) Must-Make-Deposit-OA (after allowable
embargo) and (6) Can-Waive-OA. For deposit latency, there is a positive
correlation between earlier deposit and (7) Must-Deposit-Immediately as well as
with (4) Cannot-Waive-Rights-Retention and with mandate age. There are not yet
enough OA policies to test whether still further policy conditions would
contribute to mandate effectiveness but the present findings already suggest
that it would be useful for current and future OA policies to adopt the seven
positive conditions so as to accelerate and maximise the growth of OA.

updates efficiently in terms of {\em both} time and space, not much was known
about achieving such type of algorithm. In this paper we study this issue for a
problem which lies at the core of many graph mining applications called {\em
densest subgraph problem}. We develop an algorithm that achieves time- and
space-efficiency for this problem simultaneously. It is one of the first of its
kind for graph problems to the best of our knowledge.
  In a graph $G = (V, E)$, the ""density"" of a subgraph induced by a subset of
nodes $S \subseteq V$ is defined as $|E(S)|/|S|$, where $E(S)$ is the set of
edges in $E$ with both endpoints in $S$. In the densest subgraph problem, the
goal is to find a subset of nodes that maximizes the density of the
corresponding induced subgraph. For any $\epsilon>0$, we present a dynamic
algorithm that, with high probability, maintains a $(4+\epsilon)$-approximation
to the densest subgraph problem under a sequence of edge insertions and
deletions in a graph with $n$ nodes. It uses $\tilde O(n)$ space, and has an
amortized update time of $\tilde O(1)$ and a query time of $\tilde O(1)$. Here,
$\tilde O$ hides a $O(\poly\log_{1+\epsilon} n)$ term. The approximation ratio
can be improved to $(2+\epsilon)$ at the cost of increasing the query time to
$\tilde O(n)$. It can be extended to a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation
sublinear-time algorithm and a distributed-streaming algorithm. Our algorithm
is the first streaming algorithm that can maintain the densest subgraph in {\em
one pass}. The previously best algorithm in this setting required $O(\log n)$
passes [Bahmani, Kumar and Vassilvitskii, VLDB'12]. The space required by our
algorithm is tight up to a polylogarithmic factor.

rate of solar spots is directly related to magnetic diffusivity, which itself
is a key quantity for the length of a magnetic-activity cycle. Is a linear spot
decay also seen on other stars, and is this in agreement with the large range
of solar and stellar activity cycle lengths? We investigate the evolution of
starspots on the rapidly-rotating ($P_{\rm rot}$ $\approx$ 24 d) K0 giant XX
Tri, using consecutive time-series Doppler images. Our aim is to obtain a
well-sampled movie of the stellar surface over many years, and thereby detect
and quantify a starspot decay law for further comparison with the Sun. We
obtained continuous high-resolution and phase-resolved spectroscopy with the
1.2-m robotic STELLA telescope on Tenerife over six years. For each observing
season, we obtained between 5 to 7 independent Doppler images, one per stellar
rotation, making up a total of 36 maps. To quantify starspot area decay and
growth, we match the observed images with simplified spot models based on a
Monte Carlo approach. It is shown that the surface of XX Tri is covered with
large high-latitude and even polar spots and with occasional small equatorial
spots. Just over the course of six years, we see a systematically changing spot
distribution with various timescales and morphology, such as spot fragmentation
and spot merging as well as spot decay and formation. An average linear decay
of $D$ = $-$0.022 $\pm$ 0.002 SH/day is inferred. We found evidence of an
active longitude in phase toward the (unseen) companion star. Furthermore, we
detect a weak solar-like differential rotation with a surface shear of $\alpha$
= 0.016 $\pm$ 0.003. From the decay rate, we determine a turbulent diffusivity
of $\eta_T$ = (6.3 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times$ 10$^{14}$ cm$^2$/s and predict a

the dominating time scales, which are controlled by the pulling velocity,
determine the behaviour of the probe's friction. We confirm the TTSP by
Langevin dynamics simulation. Microscopically, we find that for computing the

Properties of distributions of external fields and couplings as well as
industry sector clustering structure are studied for different historical dates
and moving window sizes. We found that a heavy positive tail in the
distribution of couplings is responsible for the sparse market clustering
structure. We also show that discrepancies between the model parameters might

amplitude of CHA in both scalar and tensor perturbations are related and depend

vulnerability, have been a serious threat to system security for over fifteen
years. Researchers have answered the threat with various mitigation techniques,
but nevertheless, new exploits that successfully bypass these technologies
still appear on a regular basis.
  In this paper, we propose ROPocop, a novel approach for detecting and
preventing the execution of injected code and for mitigating code-reuse attacks
such as return-oriented programming (RoP). ROPocop uses dynamic binary
instrumentation, requiring neither access to source code nor debug symbols or
changes to the operating system. It mitigates attacks by both monitoring the
program counter at potentially dangerous points and by detecting suspicious
program flows.
  We have implemented ROPocop for Windows x86 using PIN, a dynamic program
instrumentation framework from Intel. Benchmarks using the SPEC CPU2006 suite
show an average overhead of 2.4x, which is comparable to similar approaches,
which give weaker guarantees. Real-world applications show only an initially
noticeable input lag and no stutter. In our evaluation our tool successfully
detected all 11 of the latest real-world code-reuse exploits, with no false
alarms. Therefore, despite the overhead, it is a viable, temporary solution to
secure critical systems against exploits if a vendor patch is not yet
available.

searches for accelerated periodic sources, and search for single pulses, as
well as new interference-excision strategies and candidate selection

millisecond pulsars (MSPs; P < 10 ms), bringing the PALFA survey's discovery
totals to 145 pulsars, including 17 MSPs, and one Fast Radio Burst (FRB). The
pipeline presented here has also re-detected 188 previously known pulsars
including 60 found in PALFA data by re-analyzing observations previously
searched by other pipelines. A comprehensive description of the survey
sensitivity, including the effect of interference and red noise, has been
determined using synthetic pulsar signals with various parameters and
amplitudes injected into real survey observations and subsequently recovered
with the data reduction pipeline. We have confirmed that the PALFA survey
achieves the sensitivity to MSPs predicted by theoretical models. However, we
also find that compared to theoretical survey sensitivity models commonly used
there is a degradation in sensitivity to pulsars with periods P >= 100 ms that
gradually becomes up to a factor of ~10 worse for P > 4 s at DM < 150 pc/cc.
This degradation of sensitivity at long periods is largely due to red noise. We
find that 35 +- 3% of pulsars are missed despite being bright enough to be
detected in the absence of red noise. This reduced sensitivity could have
implications on estimates of the number of long-period pulsars in the Galaxy.

$x=1.0$. We find that the non-magnetic Al$^{3+}$ ions preferentially replace
Fe$^{3+}$ ions at two of the majority spin sites, $2a$ and $12k$, eliminating
their positive contribution to the total magnetization causing the saturation
magnetization $M_s$ to be reduced as Al concentration $x$ is increased. Our
formation probability analysis further provides the explanation for increased
magnetic anisotropy field when the fraction of Al is increased. Although
Al$^{3+}$ ions preferentially occupy the $2a$ sites at a low temperature, the
occupation probability of the $12k$ site increases with the rise of the
temperature. At a typical annealing temperature ($> 700\,^{\circ}{\rm C}$)
Al$^{3+}$ ions are much more likely to occupy the $12k$ site than the $2a$
site. Although this causes the magnetocrystalline anisotropy $K_1$ to be
reduced slightly, the reduction in $M_s$ is much more significant. Their
combined effect causes the anisotropy field $H_a$ to increase as the fraction
of Al is increased, consistent with recent experimental measurements.

truncation of the quasi-zero modes of the Dirac operator obey a symmetry larger
than the $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_A$ symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian.
This symmetry has been suggested to be $SU(4) \supset SU(2)_L \times

chirality, but also the left- and right-handed components. Here it is
demonstrated that bilinear $\overline{q}q$ interpolating fields of a given spin
$J \geq 1$ transform into each other according to irreducible representations
of $SU(4)$ or, in general, $SU(2N_F)$. This fact together with the coincidence
of the correlation functions establishes $SU(4)$ as a symmetry of the $J \geq

symmetry of the confining instantaneous charge-charge interaction in QCD.
Different subgroups of $SU(4)$ as well as the $SU(4)$ algebra are explored.

latitudinally varying insolation along Saturn's orbital path. A new time
dependent 2D photochemical model is presented to study the seasonal evolution

seasonally variable thermal field on the main stratospheric C2 hydrocarbon
chemistry (C2H2 and C2H6) using a realistic radiative climate model. Meridional
mixing and advective processes are implemented in the model but turned off in
the present study for the sake of simplicity. The results are compared to a
simple study case where a latitudinally and temporally steady thermal field is
assumed. Our simulations suggest that, when the seasonally variable thermal
field is accounted for, the downward diffusion of the seasonally produced
hydrocarbons is faster due to the seasonal compression of the atmospheric
column during winter. This effect increases with increasing latitudes which
experience the most important thermal changes in the course of the seasons. The
seasonal variability of C2H2 and C2H6 therefore persists at higher-pressure
levels with a seasonally-variable thermal field. Cassini limb-observations of

states that condensing $k$ bits of min-entropy into a $k$-bit string

$q$-independent hashing with $q= \log(1/\epsilon)$. We prove that when given a

necessary (for small values of $\epsilon$), which almost matches the positive

the inner solar system dust cloud, mainly through collisional break-up of
larger grains and are then picked-up and accelerated by the magnetized solar
wind because of their large charge-to-mass ratio. In the present paper, we
analyze the low frequency bursty noise identified in the Cassini radio and
plasma wave data during the spacecraft cruise phase inside Jupiter's orbit. The
magnitude, spectral shape and waveform of this broadband noise is consistent
with the signature of nano particles impinging at nearby the solar wind speed
on the spacecraft surface. Nanoparticles were observed whenever the radio
instrument was turned on and able to detect them, at different heliocentric
distances between Earth and Jupiter, suggesting their ubiquitous presence in
the heliosphere. We analyzed the radial dependence of the nano dust flux with
heliospheric distance and found that it is consistent with the dynamics of nano
dust originating from the inner heliosphere and picked-up by the solar wind.
The contribution of the nano dust produced in asteroid belt appears to be
negligible compared to the trapping region in the inner heliosphere. In
contrast, further out, nano dust are mainly produced by the volcanism of active
moons such as Io and Enceladus.

variability on the surface composition of the dwarf planet (136472) Makemake
Methods. We observed Makemake in April 2008 with the medium-resolution
spectrograph ISIS, at the William Herschel Telescope (La Palma, Spain) and
obtained a set of spectra in the 0.28 - 0.52 {\mu}m and 0.70 - 0.95 {\mu}m
ranges, covering 82% of its rotational period. For the rotational analysis, we
organized the spectra in four different sets corresponding to different
rotational phases, and after discarding one with low signal to noise, we
analyzed three of them that cover 71% of the surface. For these spectra we
computed the spectral slope and compared the observed spectral bands of methane
ice with reflectances of pure methane ice to search for shifts of the center of
the bands, related to the presence of CH 4 /N 2 solid solution. Results. All
the spectra have a red color with spectral slopes between 20%/1000 {\AA} and
32%/1000 {\AA} in accordance with previously reported values. Some variation in
the spectral slope is detected, pointing to the possibility of a variation in
the surface content or the particle size of the solid organic compound. The
absorption bands of methane ice present a shift toward shorter wavelengths,
indicating that methane (at least partially) is in solid solution with
nitrogen. There is no variation within the errors of the shifts with the
wavelength or with the depth of the bands, so there is no evidence of variation
in the CH 4 /N 2 mixing ratio with rotation. By comparing with all the
available data in the literature, no secular compositional variations between
2005 and 2008 is found.

existing works tend to focus on reporting CNN architectures that work well for
face recognition rather than investigate the reason. In this work, we conduct
an extensive evaluation of CNN-based face recognition systems (CNN-FRS) on a
common ground to make our work easily reproducible. Specifically, we use public
database LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) to train CNNs, unlike most existing
CNNs trained on private databases. We propose three CNN architectures which are
the first reported architectures trained using LFW data. This paper
quantitatively compares the architectures of CNNs and evaluate the effect of
different implementation choices. We identify several useful properties of
CNN-FRS. For instance, the dimensionality of the learned features can be
significantly reduced without adverse effect on face recognition accuracy. In
addition, traditional metric learning method exploiting CNN-learned features is
evaluated. Experiments show two crucial factors to good CNN-FRS performance are
the fusion of multiple CNNs and metric learning. To make our work reproducible,
source code and models will be made publicly available.

capture processes: the s- and r-process. Metal-poor stars should contain fewer
isotopes that form via the s-process, according to currently accepted theory.
It has been shown in several investigations that theory and observation do not
agree well, raising questions on the validity of either the methodology or the
theory. We analyse the metal-poor star HD140283, for which we have a high
quality spectrum. We test whether a 3D LTE stellar atmosphere and spectrum
synthesis code permits a more reliable analysis of the iron abundance and
barium isotope ratio than a 1D LTE analysis. Using 3D model atmospheres, we
examine 91 iron lines of varying strength and formation depth. This provides us
with the star's rotational speed. With this, we model the barium isotope ratio
by exploiting the hyperfine structure of the singly ionised 4554 resonance
line, and study the impact of the uncertainties in the stellar parameters.
HD140283's vsini = 1.65 +/- 0.05 km/s. Barium isotopes under the 3D paradigm
show a dominant r-process signature as 77 +/- 6 +/- 17% of barium isotopes form
via the r-process, where errors represent the assigned random and systematic
errors, respectively. We find that 3D LTE fits reproduce iron line profiles
better than those in 1D, but do not provide a unique abundance (within the
uncertainties). However, we demonstrate that the isotopic ratio is robust
against this shortcoming. Our barium isotope result agrees well with currently
accepted theory regarding the formation of the heavy-elements during the early
Galaxy. The improved fit to the asymmetric iron line profiles suggests that the
current state of 3D LTE modelling provides excellent simulations of fluid
flows. However, the abundances they provide are not yet self-consistent. This
may improve with NLTE considerations and higher resolution models.

  One factor behind the recent resurgence of the subject is a key algorithmic
step called {\em pretraining}: first search for a good generative model for the
input samples, and repeat the process one layer at a time. We show deeper
implications of this simple principle, by establishing a connection with the
interplay of orbits and stabilizers of group actions. Although the neural
networks themselves may not form groups, we show the existence of {\em shadow}
groups whose elements serve as close approximations.
  Over the shadow groups, the pre-training step, originally introduced as a
mechanism to better initialize a network, becomes equivalent to a search for
features with minimal orbits. Intuitively, these features are in a way the {\em
simplest}. Which explains why a deep learning network learns simple features
first. Next, we show how the same principle, when repeated in the deeper
layers, can capture higher order representations, and why representation
complexity increases as the layers get deeper.

bright bridge-like structure in between. With Suzaku, the south-east hump was
shown to have a temperature of 5.6 keV and the north-west one 4.6 keV. Neither
humps exhibit significant central cool component. The bridge region has a
temperature higher than 9 keV at the maximum, and this hot region is
distributed almost orthogonal to the bridge axis in agreement with the shock
heating seen in numerical simulations at an early phase of a head-on major
merger. This resemblance is supported by good positional coincidence between
the X-Ray peaks and cD galaxies associated with each cluster. In a short
exposure XMM-Newton image, a significant intensity jump was found at a position
where the Suzaku-measured temperature exhibits a steep gradient. These
properties indicate the presence of a shock discontinuity. The Mach number is
estimated to be 1.32 from the temperature difference across the identified

Duborkina","Search algorithms for efficient logistics chains","10 pages, 1 figure, in Russian","Service in Russia and Abroad, Vol. 9 (2015), No. 2 (58), 37-48","10.12737/11889",,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Logistics networks arise whenever there is a transfer of material substance
or objects (such as checked baggage on international flights) as well as
energy, information, or finance through links (channels). A general concept of
logistics network is suggested and motivated for modeling a service of any kind
supplied through links between the nodes of the network. The efficiency of a
single link is defined to be the ratio of the volume of useful service at the
output node to the volume of expended service at the input node of the link
(for a specific period of time). Similarly, the efficiency of a chain is the
ratio of the volume of service at the output to the volume of service at the
input of the chain. The overall efficiency of the chain is calculated as the
product of the efficiencies of its links; the more efficiency of the chain, the
less are the losses in the chain. This paper introduces the notion of
inadequacy of service in such a way that the overall inadequacy of a chain is
equal to the sum of the inadequacies of its links. So the efficiencies are
being multiplied, whereas the inadequacies are being added. Thus, the
antagonistic pair (efficiency, inadequacy) appears to be analogous to the pair
(reliability, entropy) in communication theory. Various possible
interpretations of the proposed logistic model are presented: energy, material,
information and financial networks. Four algorithms are provided for logistics
chain search: two algorithms for finding the most effective chain from a
specified origin to a specified destination, and two algorithms for finding the
guaranteed minimum level of service between any pair of unspecified nodes in a
given network. An example is shown as to how one of the algorithms finds the
most efficient energy chain from the electrical substation to a specified user
in a concrete energy network.

games --containing 1.4 million games played by humans between 1998 and 2007--
have shown that the popularity distribution of chess game-lines follows a
Zipf's law, and that time series inferred from the sequences of those
game-lines exhibit long-range memory effects. The presence of Zipf's law
together with long-range memory effects was observed in several systems,
however, the simultaneous emergence of these two phenomena were always studied
separately up to now. In this work, by making use of a variant of the
Yule-Simon preferential growth model, introduced by Cattuto et al., we provide
an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of Zipf's law and long-range
correlations memory effects in a chess database. We find that Cattuto's Model
(CM) is able to reproduce both, Zipf's law and the long-range correlations,
including size-dependent scaling of the Hurst exponent for the corresponding
time series. CM allows an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of these
two phenomena via a preferential growth dynamics, including a memory kernel, in
the popularity distribution of chess game-lines. This mechanism results in an
aging process in the chess game-line choice as the database grows. Moreover, we
find burstiness in the activity of subsets of the most active players, although
the aggregated activity of the pool of players displays inter-event times
without burstiness. We show that CM is not able to produce time series with
bursty behavior providing evidence that burstiness is not required for the
explanation of the long-range correlation effects in the chess database.
