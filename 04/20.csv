by a stochastic particle dynamics described by an SDE. The particle dynamics
can be thought as particle deposition that often occurs in filter problems. Our
main results include the derivation of macroscale equations and showing that
the macroscale equations are deterministic. The latter is important for our
(also many other) applications as it greatly simplifies the macroscale
equations. We use the asymptotic properties of the SDE and the periodicity of
the Brinkman's coefficient in the space variable to prove the convergence
result. The SDE has a unique invariant measure that is ergodic and strongly
mixing. The macro scale equations are derived through an averaging principle of
the slow motion (fluid velocity) with respect to the fast motion (particle
dynamics) and also by averaging the Brinkman's coefficient with respect to the
space variable. Our results can be extended to more general nonlinear diffusion
equations with heterogeneous coefficients.

hierarchically into groups. These models aim to cluster the data at different

mixture distribution to each group. Multi-level clustering is facilitated by
the sharing of these components and distributions by the groups. In this paper,
we introduce the concept of Degree of Sharing (DoS) for the mixture components

Next we introduce a generalized hierarchical Bayesian model, of which the
existing models can be shown to be special cases. Unlike most of these models,
our model takes into account the sequential nature of the data, and various
other temporal structures at different levels while assigning mixture

new physics in the largely unexplored domain of very weakly interacting
particles with masses below the Fermi scale, inaccessible to the LHC
experiments, and to study tau neutrino physics. The same proton beam setup can
be used later to look for decays of tau-leptons with lepton flavour number
non-conservation, $\tau\to 3\mu$ and to search for weakly-interacting sub-GeV
dark matter candidates. We discuss the evidence for physics beyond the Standard
Model and describe interactions between new particles and four different
portals - scalars, vectors, fermions or axion-like particles. We discuss
motivations for different models, manifesting themselves via these
interactions, and how they can be probed with the SHiP experiment and present
several case studies. The prospects to search for relatively light SUSY and
composite particles at SHiP are also discussed. We demonstrate that the SHiP
experiment has a unique potential to discover new physics and can directly
probe a number of solutions of beyond the Standard Model puzzles, such as
neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry of the Universe, dark matter, and inflation

was extended to lower velocities to include the regions that emit at nebular
epochs. Model rho-11fe is intermediate between the fast deflagration model W7
and a low-energy delayed-detonation. Good fits to the nebular spectra are
obtained if the innermost ejecta are dominated by neutron-rich, stable Fe-group
species, which contribute to cooling but not to heating. The correct thermal
balance can thus be reached for the strongest [FeII] and [FeIII] lines to be
reproduced with the observed ratio. The 56Ni mass thus obtained is 0.47 +/-
0.05 Mo. The bulk of 56Ni has an outermost velocity of ~8500 km/s. The mass of
stable iron is 0.23 +/- 0.03 Mo. Stable Ni has low abundance, ~10^{-2} Mo. This
is sufficient to reproduce an observed emission line near 7400 A. A
sub-Chandrasekhar explosion model with mass 1.02 Mo and no central stable Fe
does not reproduce the observed line ratios. A mock model where neutron-rich
Fe-group species are located above 56Ni following recent suggestions is also
shown to yield spectra that are less compatible with the observations. The

analysis, combined with those of the outer layers previously obtained, are used
to compute a synthetic bolometric light curve, which compares favourably with
the light curve of SN 2011fe.

objects of this category, called chiral vector bundles, are pairs given by a
complex vector bundle along with one of its automorphisms. We provide a
classification for the homotopy equivalence classes of these objects based on
the construction of a suitable classifying space. The computation of the
cohomology of the latter allows us to introduce a proper set of characteristic
cohomology classes: some of those just reproduce the ordinary Chern classes but
there are also new odd-dimensional classes which take care of the extra
topological information introduced by the chiral structure. Chiral vector
bundles provide a geometric model for topological quantum systems in class
AIII, namely for systems endowed with a (pseudo-)symmetry of chiral type. The
classification of the chiral vector bundles over sphere and tori (explicitly
computable up to dimension 4), recovers the commonly accepted classification
for topological insulator of class AIII which is usually based on the K-group
$K_1$. However, our classification turns out to be even richer since it takes
care also for possible non-trivial Chern classes.

energy from a spinning black hole (BH) via magnetic field lines penetrating the
event horizon of central BH. In this paper, we present a perturbation approach
to study force-free jets launched by the BZ mechanism, and its two immediate
applications: (1) we present a high-order split monopole perturbation solution
to the BZ mechanism, which accurately pins down the energy extraction rate
$\dot E$ and well describes the structure of BH magnetosphere for all range of
BH spins ($0\leq a\leq 1$); (2) the approach yields an exact constraint for the
monopole field configuration in the Kerr spacetime, $I = \Omega (1-A_\phi^2)$,
where $A_\phi$ is the $\phi-$component of the vector potential of
electromagnetic field, $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of magnetic field lines
and $I$ is the poloidal electric current. The constraint is of particular
importance to benchmark the accuracy of numerical simulations.

  populations","Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/808/1/45",,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a new method for deriving the stellar birth function (SBF) of
resolved stellar populations. The SBF (stars born per unit mass, time, and
metallicity) is the combination of the initial mass function (IMF), the
star-formation history (SFH), and the metallicity distribution function (MDF).
The framework of our analysis is that of Poisson Point Processes (PPPs), a
class of statistical models suitable when dealing with points (stars) in a
multidimensional space (the measurement space of multiple photometric bands).
The theory of PPPs easily accommodates the modeling of measurement errors as
well as that of incompleteness. Compared to most of the tools used to study
resolved stellar populations, our method avoids binning stars in the
color-magnitude diagram and uses the entirety of the information (i.e., the
whole likelihood function) for each data point; the proper combination of the
individual likelihoods allows the computation of the posterior probability for
the global population parameters. This includes unknowns such as the IMF slope
and combination of SFH and MDF, which are rarely solved for simultaneously in
the literature, however entangled and correlated they might be. Our method also
allows proper inclusion of nuisance parameters, such as distance and extinction
distributions. The aim of this paper, is to assess the validity of this new
approach under a range of assumptions, using only simulated data. Forthcoming
work will show applications to real data. Although it has a broad scope of
possible applications, we have developed this method to study multi-band HST
observations of the Milky Way Bulge. Therefore we will focus on simulations
with characteristics similar to those of the Galactic Bulge.

significant supervision, which is cumbersome to obtain. In this paper, we aim
to discover visual attributes in a weakly supervised setting that is commonly
encountered with contemporary image search engines. Deep Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) have enjoyed remarkable success in vision applications
recently. However, in a weakly supervised scenario, widely used CNN training
procedures do not learn a robust model for predicting multiple attribute labels
simultaneously. The primary reason is that the attributes highly co-occur
within the training data. To ameliorate this limitation, we propose
Deep-Carving, a novel training procedure with CNNs, that helps the net
efficiently carve itself for the task of multiple attribute prediction. During
training, the responses of the feature maps are exploited in an ingenious way
to provide the net with multiple pseudo-labels (for training images) for
subsequent iterations. The process is repeated periodically after a fixed
number of iterations, and enables the net carve itself iteratively for
efficiently disentangling features. Additionally, we contribute a
noun-adjective pairing inspired Natural Scenes Attributes Dataset to the
research community, CAMIT - NSAD, containing a number of co-occurring
attributes within a noun category. We describe, in detail, salient aspects of
this dataset. Our experiments on CAMIT-NSAD and the SUN Attributes Dataset,
with weak supervision, clearly demonstrate that the Deep-Carved CNNs
consistently achieve considerable improvement in the precision of attribute
prediction over popular baseline methods.

  We developed Exoplanet Radiative-convective Equilibrium Model (Exo-REM) to
analyze the photometric and spectro- scopic data of directly imaged planets.
The input parameters are a planet's surface gravity (g), effective temperature
(Teff ), and elemental composition. The model predicts the equilibrium
temperature profile and mixing ratio profiles of the most important gases.
Opacity sources include the H2-He collision-induced absorption and molecular
lines from eight compounds (including CH4 updated with the Exomol line list).
Absorption by iron and silicate cloud particles is added above the expected
condensation levels with a fixed scale height and a given optical depth at some
reference wavelength. Scattering was not included at this stage.
  We applied Exo-REM to photometric and spectral observations of the planet
beta Pictoris b obtained in a series of near-IR filters. We derived Teff = 1550
+- 150 K, log(g) = 3.5 +- 1, and radius R = 1.76 +- 0.24 RJup (2-{\sigma} error

make accurate images with resolutions of tens of milliarcseconds, which at
submillimeter (submm) wavelengths requires baselines up to ~15 km. To develop
and test this capability, a Long Baseline Campaign (LBC) was carried out from
September to late November 2014, culminating in end-to-end observations,
calibrations, and imaging of selected Science Verification (SV) targets. This
paper presents an overview of the campaign and its main results, including an
investigation of the short-term coherence properties and systematic phase
errors over the long baselines at the ALMA site, a summary of the SV targets
and observations, and recommendations for science observing strategies at long
baselines. Deep ALMA images of the quasar 3C138 at 97 and 241 GHz are also
compared to VLA 43 GHz results, demonstrating an agreement at a level of a few
percent. As a result of the extensive program of LBC testing, the highly
successful SV imaging at long baselines achieved angular resolutions as fine as
19 mas at ~350 GHz. Observing with ALMA on baselines of up to 15 km is now
possible, and opens up new parameter space for submm astronomy.

considering our Sun as reference point. This approach overlooks, however, that
Herbig Ae/Be stars are in some sense much better targets to study planet
formation processes empirically, with their disks generally being larger,
brighter and simply easier to observe across a large wavelength range. In
addition, massive gas giant planets have been found on wide orbits around early
type stars, triggering the question if these objects did indeed form there and,
if so, by what process. In the following I briefly review what we currently
know about the occurrence rate of planets around intermediate mass stars,
before discussing recent results from Herbig Ae/Be stars in the context of
planet formation. The main emphasis is put on spatially resolved polarized
light images of potentially planet forming disks and how these images - in
combination with other data - can be used to empirically constrain (parts of)
the planet formation process. Of particular interest are two objects, HD100546
and HD169142, where, in addition to intriguing morphological structures in the
disks, direct observational evidence for (very) young planets has been
reported. I conclude with an outlook, what further progress we can expect in
the very near future with the next generation of high-contrast imagers at 8-m

layered MoS2 using direct vapor-phase sulfurization of MoO2, which enables us
to obtain extremely high-quality single-crystal monolayer MoS2 samples with
field-effect mobility exceeding 30 cm2/Vs in monolayers. These samples can be
readily synthesized on a variety of substrates, and demonstrate a high-degree
of optoelectronic uniformity in Raman and photoluminescence mapping over entire

high crystalline quality, Raman spectroscopy on these samples reveal a range of
multi-phonon processes through peaks with equal or better clarity compared to
past reports on mechanically exfoliated samples. This enables us to investigate
the layer thickness- and substrate-dependence of the extremely weak phonon
processes at 285 cm-1 and 487 cm-1 in 2D MoS2. The ultra-high,
optoelectronic-grade crystalline quality of these samples could be further
established through photocurrent spectroscopy, which clearly reveal excitonic

on device fabricated with mechanically exfoliated that were artificially
suspended across trenches. Our method reflects a big step in the development of

different decay mechanisms affect this interacting many-body system. We also
analyze our system in the case of two Rydberg excitations within the blockade

plasmon waves couple into the radiative modes of the molecules and increase the
radiative efficiency. Here, we report a hitherto unknown size dependence of
this metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) effect in the nanoscale. When the
molecules are deposited in nanoporous anodic alumina films with exposed
aluminum at the bottom of the pores, they form organic nanowires standing on
aluminum nanoparticles whose plasmon waves have much larger amplitudes. This
increases the MEF strongly, resulting in several orders of magnitude increase
in the fluorescence intensity of the organic fluorophores. The increase in
intensity shows an inverse super-linear dependence on nanowire diameter because
the nanowires also act as plasmonic 'waveguides' that concentrate the plasmons
and increase the coupling of the plasmons with the radiative modes of the
molecules. Furthermore, if the nanoporous template housing the nanowires has
built-in electric fields due to space charges, a strong molecule-specific red-
or blue-shift is induced in the fluorescence peak owing to a renormalization of
the dipole moment of the molecule. This can be exploited to detect minute
amounts of target molecules in a mixture using their optical signature
(fluorescence) despite the presence of confounding background signals. It can
result in a unique new technology for bio- and chemical-sensing.

to find high-performing solutions: chemists search through the space of
molecules to discover new drugs; engineers search for stronger, cheaper, safer
designs, scientists search for models that best explain data, etc. The goal of
search algorithms has traditionally been to return the single
highest-performing solution in a search space. Here we describe a new,
fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it
provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed
throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at
each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to
choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites)
algorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how
interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either
positively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may
wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their
cost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing,
yet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single,
high-performing solution. Interestingly, because MAP-Elites explores more of
the search space, it also tends to find a better overall solution than
state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new
algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular
neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots. Because MAP-
Elites (1) illuminates the relationship between performance and dimensions of

offer great promise as information carriers for future ultra-dense memory and

focused on the skyrmions properties in highly confined geometry such as one
dimensional nanowires5-8. Hitherto it is still experimentally unclear what
happens when the width of the nanowire is comparable to that of a single
skyrmion. Here we report the experimental demonstration of such scheme, where
magnetic field-driven skyrmion cluster (SC) states with small numbers of
skyrmions were demonstrated to exist on the cross-sections of ultra-narrow
single-crystal MnSi nanowires (NWs) with diameters, comparable to the skyrmion
lattice constant (18 nm). In contrast to the skyrmion lattice in bulk MnSi
samples, the skyrmion clusters lead to anomalous magnetoresistance (MR)
behavior measured under magnetic field parallel to the NW long axis, where
quantized jumps in MR are observed and directly associated with the change of
the skyrmion number in the cluster, which is supported by Monte Carlo
simulations. These jumps show the key difference between the clustering and
crystalline states of skyrmions, and lay a solid foundation to realize
skyrmion-based memory devices that the number of skyrmions can be counted via
conventional electrical measurements.

well as a broad class of learning processes based on best-response dynamics,
that we refer to as FP-type algorithms. A well-known shortcoming of FP is that,
while players may learn an equilibrium strategy in some abstract sense, there
are no guarantees that the period-by-period strategies generated by the
algorithm actually converge to equilibrium themselves. This issue is
fundamentally related to the discontinuous nature of the best response
correspondence and is inherited by many FP-type algorithms. Not only does it
cause problems in the interpretation of such algorithms as a mechanism for
economic and social learning, but it also greatly diminishes the practical
value of these algorithms for use in distributed control. We refer to forms of
learning in which players learn equilibria in some abstract sense only (to be
defined more precisely in the paper) as weak learning, and we refer to forms of
learning where players' period-by-period strategies converge to equilibrium as
strong learning. An approach is presented for modifying an FP-type algorithm
that achieves weak learning in order to construct a variant that achieves
strong learning. Theoretical convergence results are proved.

show that the discriminative information of a skeleton sequence usually resides

hypernuclear low-lying states based on a covariant density functional theory.
In this method, the hypernuclear states are constructed by coupling a hyperon
to low-lying states of the core nucleus, which are described by the generator
coordinate method (GCM) with the particle number and angular momentum
projections. We apply this method to study in detail the low-lying spectrum of
$^{13}_{~\Lambda}$C and $^{21}_{~\Lambda}$Ne hypernuclei. We also briefly
discuss the structure of $^{155}_{~~\Lambda}$Sm as an example of heavy deformed
hypernuclei. It is shown that the low-lying excitation spectrum with positive
parity states of the hypernuclei, which are dominated by $\Lambda$ hyperon in
$s$-orbital coupled to the core states, are similar to that for the
corresponding core states, while the electric quadrupole transition strength,
$B(E2)$, from the 2$^+_1$ state to the ground state is reduced according to the
mass number of the hypernuclei. Our study indicates that the energy splitting
between the first 1/2$^-$ and 3/2$^-$ hypernuclear states is generally small
for all the hypernuclei which we study. However, their configurations depend
much on the properties of a core nucleus, in particular on the sign of
deformation parameter. That is, the first $1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ states in
$^{13}_{~\Lambda}$C are dominated by a single configuration with $\Lambda$
particle in the $p$-wave orbits and thus providing good candidates for a study
of the $\Lambda$ spin-orbit splitting. On the other hand, those states in the
other hypernuclei exhibit a large configuration mixing and thus their energy
difference cannot be interpreted as the spin-orbit splitting for the
$p$-orbits.

fascinating properties and potential applications. The interlayer interactions
are much weaker than the intralayer bonds, allowing the as-synthesized
materials to exhibit different stacking sequences (e.g. ABAB, ABCABC), leading
to different physical properties. Here, we show that regardless of the space
group of the 2D material, the Raman frequencies of the interlayer shear modes
observed under the typical configuration blue shift for AB stacked materials,
and red shift for ABC stacked materials, as the number of layers increases. Our
predictions are made using an intuitive bond polarizability model which shows
that stacking sequence plays a key role in determining which interlayer shear
modes lead to the largest change in polarizability (Raman intensity); the modes
with the largest Raman intensity determining the frequency trends. We present
direct evidence for these conclusions by studying the Raman modes in few layer
graphene, MoS2, MoSe2, WSe2 and Bi2Se3, using both first principles
calculations and Raman spectroscopy. This study sheds light on the influence of
stacking sequence on the Raman intensities of intrinsic interlayer modes in 2D
layered materials in general, and leads to a practical way of identifying the
stacking sequence in these materials.

fractionation factor $\Phi$ is correlated with the strength of the
intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This correlation has been used to determine the

across all observed wavelength bands. We compare the recent spectroscopic event
in mid-2014 to the events in 2003 and 2009 and investigate long-term trends.
Methods. Eta Car was observed with HST STIS, VLT UVES, and CTIO 1.5m CHIRON for
a period of more than two years in 2012-2015. Archival observations with these
instruments cover three orbital cycles. Results. Important spectroscopic
diagnostics show significant changes in 2014 compared to previous events. While
the timing of the first HeII 4686 flash was remarkably similar to previous
events, the HeII equivalent widths were slightly larger and the line flux
increased compared to 2003. The second HeII peak occurred at about the same
phase as in 2009, but was stronger. The HeI line flux grew in 2009-2014
compared to 1998-2003. On the other hand, Halpha and FeII lines show the
smallest emission strengths ever observed. Conclusions. The basic character of
the spectroscopic events has changed in the past 2-3 cycles; ionizing UV
radiation dramatically weakened during each pre-2014 event but not in 2014. The
strengthening of HeI emission and the weakening of the lower-excitation wind
features in our direct line of sight implies a substantial change in the
physical parameters of the emitting regions. The polar spectrum at FOS4 shows
less changes in the broad wind emission lines, which may be explained by the
latitude-dependent wind structure of eta Car. The quick and strong recovery of
the HeII emission in 2014 supports a scenario, in which the wind-wind shock may
not have completely collapsed as was proposed for previous events. All this may
be the consequence of just one elementary change, namely a strong decrease in
the primary's mass-loss rate.

Unfortunately, existing likelihood-based methods for fitting hierarchical

adoption in large-scale prediction and inference problems. This paper proposes
a moment-based procedure for estimating the parameters of a hierarchical model
which has its roots in a method originally introduced by Cochran in 1937. The
method trades statistical efficiency for computational efficiency. It gives
consistent parameter estimates, competitive prediction error performance, and
substantial computational improvements. When applied to a large-scale

reducing the sequential computation time from hours to minutes.

Data partitioning and replication, combined with local and geographical

order requests among replicas and partitions. One way to tackle this problem is
to use group communication primitives that encapsulate order requirements. This
paper presents a detailed performance evaluation of Multi-Ring Paxos, a

aims to classify objects with subtle distinctions. Most existing works heavily
rely on object / part detectors to build the correspondence between object
parts by using object or object part annotations inside training images. The
need for expensive object annotations prevents the wide usage of these methods.
Instead, we propose to select useful parts from multi-scale part proposals in
objects, and use them to compute a global image representation for
categorization. This is specially designed for the annotation-free fine-grained
categorization task, because useful parts have shown to play an important role
in existing annotation-dependent works but accurate part detectors can be
hardly acquired. With the proposed image representation, we can further detect
and visualize the key (most discriminative) parts in objects of different
classes. In the experiment, the proposed annotation-free method achieves better
accuracy than that of state-of-the-art annotation-free and most existing
annotation-dependent methods on two challenging datasets, which shows that it
is not always necessary to use accurate object / part annotations in
fine-grained image categorization.

Information Filtering (denoted as TDIF for short) in social media. In this
paper, we start open discussions on such application problems. We first analyze
the properties of the TDIF problem, which usually contains several typical
requirements: relevance, diversity, recency and confidence. Recency means that
users want to follow the recent opinions or news. Additionally, the confidence
of information must be taken into consideration. How to balance these factors
properly in online data stream is very important and challenging. We propose a
dynamic preservation strategy on the basis of an existing feature-based utility

Recently, single layer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) exhibits valleys

combined with the strong excitonic effect influences the optical excitation.
Here we discover a new set of optical selection rules in monolayer WS2,imposed

principle for second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon luminescence
(TPL). Moreover, the two-photon induced valley populations yield net circular

last for 8 ps. The discovery of this new optical selection rule in valleytronic

B = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 & 0 \\ 0 & b_2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad y = \begin{pmatrix}

L^1[0,1] \otimes \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}$ and $b_1 < 0 < b_2$. If $b_2 = -b_1
=1$ this equation is equivalent to one dimensional Dirac equation. It is proved
that the system of root functions of a linear boundary value problem
constitutes a Riesz basis in $L^2[0,1] \otimes \mathbb{C}^2$ provided that the
boundary conditions are strictly regular.
  By analogy with the case of ordinary differential equations, boundary
conditions are called strictly regular if the eigenvalues of the corresponding
unperturbed $(Q=0)$ operator are asymptotically simple and separated. As
distinguished from the Dirac case there is no simple algebraic criterion of the
strict regularity whenever $b_1 + b_2 \not = 0$. However under certain
restrictions on coefficients of the boundary linear forms we present certain
algebraic criteria of the strict regularity in the latter case. In particular,
it is shown that regular separated boundary conditions are always strictly
regular while periodic (antiperiodic) boundary conditions are strictly regular
if and only if $b_1 + b_2 \not = 0.$
  The proof of the main result is based on existence of triangular
transformation operators for system (1). Their existence is also established
here in the case of a summable $Q$. In the case of regular (but not strictly
regular) boundary conditions we prove the Riesz basis property with
parentheses. The main results are applied to establish the Riesz basis property
of the dynamic generator of spatially non-homogenous damped Timoshenko beam
model.

the simulation of turbulent combustion, employing the statistically most likely
distribution (SMLD) approach for the joint probability density function (PDF)
of the mixture fraction, Z, and of the progress parameter, {\Lambda} .
Steady-state FPV models are built presuming the func- tional shape of the joint
PDF of Z and {\Lambda} in order to evaluate Favre-averages of thermody- namic
quantities. The mixture fraction is widely assumed to behave as a passive
scalar with a mono-modal behaviour modelled by a \b{eta} -distribution.
Moreover, under the hypothesis that Z and {\Lambda} are statistically
independent, the joint PDF coincides with the product of the two marginal PDFs.
In this work we discuss these two constitutive hypotheses. The proposed model
evaluates the most probable joint distribution of Z and {\Lambda} , relaxing
some crucial as- sumption on their statistical behaviour. This provides a more
general model in the context of FPV approach and an effective tool to verify
the adequateness of widely used hypotheses. The model is validated versus
experimental data of well-known test cases, namely, the San- dia flames. The
results are also compared with those obtained by the standard FPV approach,
analysing the role of the PDF functional form on turbulent combustion
simulations.

resolution toward DNA sequencing. Among them, molybdenum disulphide (MoS2)
shows long-term stability as well as superior sensitivity enabling high
throughput performance. The traditional method of fabricating nanopores with
nanometer precision is based on the use of focused electron beams in
transmission electron microscope (TEM). This nanopore fabrication process is
time-consuming, expensive, not scalable and hard to control below 1 nm. Here,
we exploited the electrochemical activity of MoS2 and developed a convenient
and scalable method to controllably make nanopores in single-layer MoS2 with
sub-nanometer precision using electrochemical reaction (ECR). The
electrochemical reaction on the surface of single-layer MoS2 is initiated at
the location of defects or single atom vacancy, followed by the successive
removals of individual atoms or unit cells from single-layer MoS2 lattice and
finally formation of a nanopore. Step-like features in the ionic current
through the growing nanopore provide direct feedback on the nanopore size
inferred from a widely used conductance vs. pore size model. Furthermore, DNA
translocations can be detected in-situ when as-fabricated MoS2 nanopores are
used. The atomic resolution and accessibility of this approach paves the way
for mass production of nanopores in 2D membranes for potential solid-state
nanopore sequencing.

hence it has become increasingly important to understand their behaviors in
order to further improve the performance of data center computer systems, in
which characterizing representative workloads is a key practical problem. In
this paper, after investigating three most impor- tant application domains in
terms of page views and daily visitors, we chose 11 repre- sentative data
analytics workloads and characterized their micro-architectural behaviors by
using hardware performance counters, so as to understand the impacts and
implications of data analytics workloads on the systems equipped with modern
superscalar out-of-order processors. Our study reveals that big data analytics
applications themselves share many inherent characteristics, which place them
in a different class from traditional workloads and scale-out services. To
further understand the characteristics of big data analytics work- loads we
performed a correlation analysis of CPI (cycles per instruction) with other
micro- architecture level characteristics and an investigation of the big data
software stack impacts on application behaviors. Our correlation analysis
showed that even though big data ana- lytics workloads own notable pipeline
front end stalls, the main factors affecting the CPI performance are long
latency data accesses rather than the front end stalls. Our software stack
investigation found that the typical big data software stack significantly
contributes to the front end stalls and incurs bigger working set. Finally we
gave several recommen- dations for architects, programmers and big data system
designers with the knowledge acquired from this paper.

parity-check (LDPC) codes from complete protographs. A complete protograph is a
small bipartite graph with two disjoint vertex sets such that every vertex in
the variable-node set is connected to every vertex in the check-node set by a
unique edge. This paper analyzes the required lifting factor for achieving
girths of six or eight in the resulting quasi-cyclic codes with constraints on
lifting. The required lifting factors provide lower bounds on the block-length

that the conductivity behaves differently in the directions parallel and
perpendicular to the tilting of the cone. At high magnetic fields the
conductivity at non-zero Landau levels in the direction perpendicular to the
tilting modifies non-trivially, in contrast to the parallel case. At zero
temperature the crossover of the conductivity at the Dirac point from high to
low magnetic field is studied numerically. It is found that that the tilting
produces anisotropy of the conductivity which changes with the magnetic field

discuss the conductivity at finite temperatures and finite magnetic fields

Dirichlet form on the same state space. It inherits the same form of original

paper are the regular subspaces of associated Dirichlet forms of skew product
diffusions. A skew product diffusion $X$ is a symmetric Markov process on the
product state space $E_1\times E_2$ and expressed as \[
X_t=(X^1_t,X^2_{A_t}),\quad t\geq 0, \] where $X^i$ is a symmetric diffusion on

subspace of $X$, say \[ Y_t=(Y^1_t,Y^2_{\tilde{A}_t}),\quad t\geq 0, \] can be
characterized as follows: the associated smooth measure of $\tilde{A}$ is equal
to that of $A$, and $Y^i$ corresponds to a regular subspace of $X^i$ for

systems near periodic traveling waves. First, following the formal averaging
method of Whitham, we derive modulation systems expected to drive at main order
the time evolution of slowly modulated wavetrains. Then, for waves whose period
is commensurable to the lattice, we prove that the formally-derived first-order
averaged system must be at least weakly hyperbolic if the background waves are
to be spectrally stable, and, when weak hyperbolicity is met, the
characteristic velocities of the modulation system provide group velocities of
the original system. Historically, for dynamical evolutions obeying partial
differential equations, this has been proved, according to increasing level of
algebraic complexity, first for systems of reaction-diffusion type, then for
generic systems of balance laws, at last for Hamiltonian systems. Here, for
their semi-discrete counterparts, we give at once simultaneous proofs for all

discrete analogous to the continuous Bloch transform. Nevertheless , we needed
to overcome the absence of genuine space-translation invariance, a key

nanocomposites in which the alignment direction and the level of orientation of
the nanorods could easily be tuned by simply adjusting the intensity of a
magnetic field applied during polymerization. Because the particle volume
fraction was kept low (1-5.5 vol \%), we used the orientational order induced
by the field in the isotropic phase rather than the spontaneous orientational
order of the nematic phase. At the strongest field values (up to 1.5 T), the
particles exhibit almost perfect antinematic alignment, as measured by optical
birefringence and small-angle X-ray scattering. The results of these two
techniques are in remarkably good agreement, validating the use of
birefringence measurements for quantifying the degree of orientational order.
We also demonstrate that the ordering induced by the field in the isotropic
suspension is preserved in the final material after field removal. This work
illustrates the interest, for such problems, of considering the field-induced
alignment of anisotropic nanoparticles in the isotropic phase, an approach that
is effective at low filler content, that avoids the need of controlling the

mass, stars dominate the total mass within the galaxy half-mass radius, making
stars and DM rounder and more oblate. A large population of elongated galaxies

(SOC) has been one of the most stimulating concepts to come out of statistical
mechanics and condensed matter theory in the last few decades, and has played a
significant role in the development of complexity science. SOC, and more
generally fractals and power laws, have attacted much comment, ranging from the
very positive to the polemical. The other papers in this special issue
(Aschwanden et al, 2014; McAteer et al, 2014; Sharma et al, 2015) showcase the
considerable body of observations in solar, magnetospheric and fusion plasma
inspired by the SOC idea, and expose the fertile role the new paradigm has
played in approaches to modeling and understanding multiscale plasma
instabilities. This very broad impact, and the necessary process of adapting a
scientific hypothesis to the conditions of a given physical system, has meant
that SOC as studied in these fields has sometimes differed significantly from
the definition originally given by its creators. In Bak's own field of
theoretical physics there are significant observational and theoretical open
questions, even 25 years on (Pruessner, 2012). One aim of the present review is
to address the dichotomy between the great reception SOC has received in some
areas, and its shortcomings, as they became manifest in the controversies it
triggered. Our article tries to clear up what we think are misunderstandings of
SOC in fields more remote from its origins in statistical mechanics, condensed
matter and dynamical systems by revisiting Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld's original

toward $\theta$-independent spectra with a slope corresponding to the
perpendicular cascade. This occurs at a transition frequency
$f_{2D}(L,\alpha,\theta)$, which is analytically estimated and depends on outer
scale $L$, critical balance exponent $\alpha$ and field-to-flow angle $\theta$.
We discuss anisotropic damping terms acting on the $\mathbf{k}$-space
distribution of energy and their effects on the PSD. Further, we show that the
spectral anisotropies $\kappa(\theta)$ as found by Horbury et al. (2008) and
Chen et al. (2010) in the solar wind are in accordance with a damped critically
balanced cascade of kinetic Alfv\'en waves. We also model power spectra
obtained by von Papen et al. (2014) in Saturn's plasma sheet and find that the
change of spectral indices inside $9\,R_\mathrm{s}$ can be explained by damping
on electron scales.

complexities which strongly deviate from spherical symmetry, generally assumed

generally believed to be formed by binary interactions, which has been directly
observed in multiple sources. We seek to investigate the manifestation in the
observables of spiral structures embedded in the spherical outflows of cool
stars. We aim to provide an intuitive bedrock with which upcoming ALMA data can
be compared and interpreted. By means of an extended parameter study, we model
rotational CO emission from the stellar outflow of asymptotic giant branch
stars. To this end, we develop a simplified analytical parametrised description
of a 3D spiral structure. This model is embedded into a spherical wind, and fed
into the 3D radiative transfer code LIME, which produces 3D intensity maps
throughout velocity space. Subsequently, we investigate the spectral signature
of rotational transitions of CO of the models, as well as the spatial aspect of
this emission by means of wide-slit PV diagrams. Additionally, the potential
for misinterpretation of the 3D data in a 1D context is quantified. Finally, we
simulate ALMA observations to explore the impact of interefrometric noise and
artifacts on the emission signatures. The spectral signatures of the CO
rotational transition v=0 J=3-2 are very efficient at concealing the dual
nature of the outflow. Only a select few parameter combinations allow for the
spectral lines to disclose the presence of the spiral structure. The inability
to disentangle the spiral from the spherical signal can result in an incorrect
interpretation in a 1D context. Consequently, erroneous mass loss rates would
be calculated...

cosmological evolution and can be constrained through observations. We consider
the possibility that neutrinos possess secret scalar or pseudoscalar
interactions mediated by the Nambu-Goldstone boson of a still unknown
spontaneously broken global $U(1)$ symmetry, as in, e.g. , Majoron models. In
such scenarios, neutrinos still decouple at $T\simeq 1$ MeV, but become tightly
coupled again ('recouple') at later stages of the cosmological evolution. We
use available observations of CMB anisotropies, including Planck 2013 and the
joint BICEP2/Planck 2015 data, to derive constraints on the quantity
$\gamma_{\nu \nu}^4$, parameterizing the neutrino collision rate due to
(pseudo)scalar interactions. We consider both a minimal extension of the
standard $\Lambda$CDM model, and scenarios with extra relativistic species or
non-vanishing tensors. We find a typical constraint $\gamma_{\nu \nu}^4 <
0.9\times 10^{-27}$ (95% C.L.), implying an upper limit on the redshift
$z_{rec}$ of neutrino recoupling $< 8500$. In the framework of Majoron models,
the upper limit on $\gamma_{\nu \nu}$ roughly translates on a constraint $g <
8.2\times 10^{-7}$ on the Majoron-neutrino coupling constant $g$. In general,
the data show a weak ($\sim 1\sigma$) but intriguing preference for non-zero
values of $\gamma_{\nu \nu}^4$, with best fits in the range $\gamma_{\nu \nu}^4
= (0.15 - 0.35)\times 10^{-27}$, depending on the particular dataset. This is
more evident when either observations from ACT and SPT are included, or the
possibility of non-vanishing tensor modes is considered. In particular, for the

even at higher densities. We study in detail the temperatures of dust & gas in
the photon-dominated region S 140, especially around the deeply embedded
infrared sources IRS 1-3 and at the ionization front. We derive the dust
temperature and column density by combining Herschel PACS continuum
observations with SOFIA observations at 37 $\mu$m and SCUBA at 450 $\mu$m. We
model these observations using greybody fits and the DUSTY radiative transfer
code. For the gas part we use RADEX to model the CO 1-0, CO 2-1, 13CO 1-0 and
C18O 1-0 emission lines mapped with the IRAM-30m over a 4' field. Around IRS
1-3, we use HIFI observations of single-points and cuts in CO 9-8, 13CO 10-9
and C18O 9-8 to constrain the amount of warm gas, using the best fitting dust
model derived with DUSTY as input to the non-local radiative transfer model
RATRAN. We find that the gas temperature around the infrared sources varies
between 35 and 55K and that the gas is systematically warmer than the dust by
~5-15K despite the high gas density. In addition we observe an increase of the
gas temperature from 30-35K in the surrounding up to 40-45K towards the
ionization front, most likely due to the UV radiation from the external star.
Furthermore, detailed models of the temperature structure close to IRS 1 show
that the gas is warmer and/or denser than what we model. Finally, modelling of
the dust emission from the sub-mm peak SMM 1 constrains its luminosity to a few
~10^2 Lo. We conclude that the gas heating in the S 140 region is very
efficient even at high densities, most likely due to the deep UV penetration
from the embedded sources in a clumpy medium and/or oblique shocks.

a domain. Structure learning forms one of the inference challenges of
statistical graphical models.
  MCMC methods, notably structure MCMC, to sample graphs from the posterior
distribution given the data are probably the only viable option for Bayesian
model averaging. Score modularity and restrictions on the number of parents of
each node allow the graphs to be grouped into larger collections, which can be
scored as a whole to improve the chain's convergence. Current examples of
algorithms taking advantage of grouping are the biased order MCMC, which acts
on the alternative space of permuted triangular matrices, and non ergodic edge
reversal moves.
  Here we propose a novel algorithm, which employs the underlying combinatorial
structure of DAGs to define a new grouping. As a result convergence is improved
compared to structure MCMC, while still retaining the property of producing an
unbiased sample. Finally the method can be combined with edge reversal moves to
improve the sampler further.

a topological insulator, with zero-energy edge modes with fractional spin. On

building block for numerous applications such as algebraic multigrid method

BLAS routines, an efficient parallel SpGEMM implementation has to handle extra
irregularity from three aspects: (1) the number of nonzero entries in the
resulting sparse matrix is unknown in advance, (2) very expensive parallel
insert operations at random positions in the resulting sparse matrix dominate
the execution time, and (3) load balancing must account for sparse data in both
input matrices.
  In this work we propose a framework for SpGEMM on GPUs and emerging CPU-GPU
heterogeneous processors. This framework particularly focuses on the above
three problems. Memory pre-allocation for the resulting matrix is organized by
a hybrid method that saves a large amount of global memory space and
efficiently utilizes the very limited on-chip scratchpad memory. Parallel
insert operations of the nonzero entries are implemented through the GPU merge
path algorithm that is experimentally found to be the fastest GPU merge
approach. Load balancing builds on the number of necessary arithmetic
operations on the nonzero entries and is guaranteed in all stages.
  Compared with the state-of-the-art CPU and GPU SpGEMM methods, our approach
delivers excellent absolute performance and relative speedups on various
benchmarks multiplying matrices with diverse sparsity structures. Furthermore,
on heterogeneous processors, our SpGEMM approach achieves higher throughput by
using re-allocatable shared virtual memory.

maximize downlink rate but also to ensure the minimum uplink rate. With this
end, we firstly derive the mmWave overlaid ultra-dense cellular network
spectral efficiencies for both uplink and downlink cases in closed forms by
using stochastic geometry via a lower bound approximation. In a practical
scenario, such tractable results of the proposed network reveal that incumbent

transmissions in order to correspond with the mmWave downlink rate improvement.
Furthermore, increasing uplink rate via $\mu$Wave BS densification cannot
solely cope with the mmWave downlink/uplink rate asymmetry, and thus requires
additional $\mu$Wave spectrum in 5G cellular networks.

technical and biological systems and crucially limits signal transduction and
transmission. Stochastic resonance (SR) has been identified to have the
potential to tackle this problem, namely to enable non-linear systems to detect
small, otherwise sub-threshold signals by means of added non-zero noise. This
has been demonstrated within a wide range of systems in physical, technological
and biological contexts. Based on its ubiquitous importance, numerous
theoretical and technical approaches aim at an optimization of signal
transduction based on SR. Several quantities like mutual information,
signal-to-noise-ratio, or the cross-correlation between input stimulus and
resulting detector response have been used to determine optimal noise
intensities for SR. The fundamental shortcoming with all these measures is that
knowledge of the signal to be detected is required to compute them. This
dilemma prevents the use of adaptive SR procedures in any application where the
signal to be detected is unknown. We here show that the autocorrelation
function (AC) of the detector response fundamentally overcomes this drawback.
For a simplified model system, the equivalence of the output AC with the
measures mentioned above is proven analytically. In addition, we test our
approach numerically for a variety of systems comprising different input
signals and different types of detectors. The results indicate a strong
similarity between mutual information and output AC in terms of the optimal
noise intensity for SR. Hence, using the output AC to adaptively vary the
amount of added noise in order to maximize information transmission via SR
might be a fundamental processing principle in nature, in particular within
neural systems which could be implemented in future technical applications.

ratio of radius and margin, while standard SVM only considers the maximization
of the margin but ignores the minimization of the radius. Several approaches
have been proposed to integrate radius and margin for joint learning of feature
transformation and SVM classifier. However, most of them either require the
form of the transformation matrix to be diagonal, or are non-convex and
computationally expensive. In this paper, we suggest a novel approximation for
the radius of minimum enclosing ball (MEB) in feature space, and then propose a
convex radius-margin based SVM model for joint learning of feature
transformation and SVM classifier, i.e., F-SVM. An alternating minimization
method is adopted to solve the F-SVM model, where the feature transformation is
updatedvia gradient descent and the classifier is updated by employing the
existing SVM solver. By incorporating with kernel principal component analysis,
F-SVM is further extended for joint learning of nonlinear transformation and
classifier. Experimental results on the UCI machine learning datasets and the
LFW face datasets show that F-SVM outperforms the standard SVM and the existing
radius-margin based SVMs, e.g., RMM, R-SVM+ and R-SVM+{\mu}.

These traits conflict with the irregular structure (block-sparse or rank-sparse

physics. To deal with such irregular data we present a new MM algorithm based
on Scalable Universal Matrix Multiplication Algorithm (SUMMA). The novel
features are: (1) multiple-issue scheduling of SUMMA iterations, and (2)
fine-grained task-based formulation. The latter eliminates the need for
explicit internodal synchronization; with multiple-iteration scheduling this
allows load imbalance due to nonuniform matrix structure. For square MM with
uniform and nonuniform block sizes (the latter simulates matrices with general
irregular structure) we found excellent performance in weak and strong-scaling
regimes, on commodity and high-end hardware.

existence of a three-component FF pairing state in which every two out of the

orders of magnitude in less than 1-2 days. The lowest X-ray luminosity observed
reaches a value of ~1e32 erg/s, only a factor of a few brighter than its
typical quiescent level. We investigate the 2008 and 2005 reflaring state of

investigate the most likely configuration of the innermost regions of the

to a difference in demagnetization factors arising due to the disc shape of the
sample. The magnetic phase transition in MnSi in zero magnetic field is
signified by a quasi discontinuity in the c11 elastic constant, which varies
significantly with magnetic field. It is notable that the region where the c11
discontinuity almost vanishes closely corresponds to the extent of skyrmion
phase along the magnetic to paramagnetic transition. This implies that the c11
elastic constant is almost continuous through the transition from the skyrmion
to paramagnetic phases. A recovery of the discontinuity of c11 and enhanced
sound absorption occur at the crossing of the phase transition line and the
line of minima in c11. The powerful fluctuations at the minima of c11 make the
mentioned crossing point similar to a critical end point, where a second order
phase transition meets a first order one. The skyrmion domain in the case of a
perpendicular setup with a smaller demagnetization factor has a reduced
temperature range, which suggests that the magnetic field inhomogeneity plays
an important role in the skyrmion occurrence and, hence, opens a way of
skyrmion manipulation. The small anisotropy of the shear moduli in the (001)
plane found in the parallel setup is most probably also caused by the magnetic
field inhomogeneity, which distorts the hexagonal symmetry of the skyrmion
crystal.

pulse irradiation can undergo the so-called 'nonthermal melting' if the density
of electrons excited from the valence to the conduction band overcomes a
certain critical value. Such ultrafast transition is induced by strong changes
in the atomic potential energy surface, which trigger atomic relocation.
However, heating of a material due to the electron-phonon coupling can also
lead to a phase transition, called 'thermal melting'. This thermal melting can
occur even if the excited-electron density is much too low to induce
non-thermal effects. To study phase transitions, and in particular, the
interplay of the thermal and nonthermal effects in silicon under a femtosecond
x-ray irradiation, we propose their unified treatment by going beyond the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation within our hybrid model based on tight binding
molecular dynamics. With our extended model we identify damage thresholds for
various phase transitions in irradiated silicon. We show that electron-phonon
coupling triggers the phase transition of solid silicon into a low-density
liquid phase if the energy deposited into the sample is above $\sim0.65$ eV per
atom. For the deposited doses of over $\sim0.9$ eV per atom, solid silicon
undergoes a phase transition into high-density liquid phase triggered by an
interplay between electron-phonon heating and nonthermal effects. These
thresholds are much lower than those predicted with the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation ($\sim2.1$ eV/atom), and indicate a significant contribution of
electron-phonon coupling to the relaxation of the laser-excited silicon. We
expect that these results will stimulate dedicated experimental studies,
unveiling in detail various paths of structural relaxation within
laser-irradiated silicon.

thermodynamics for small-scale systems. One of the main difficulties is to
capture a suitable notion of work that models realistically the purpose of
quantum machines, in an analogous way to the role played, for macroscopic
machines, by the energy stored in the idealisation of a lifted weight. Despite
of several attempts to resolve this issue by putting forward specific models,
these are far from capturing realistically the transitions that a quantum
machine is expected to perform. In this work, we adopt a novel strategy by
considering arbitrary kinds of systems that one can attach to a quantum thermal
machine and seeking for work quantifiers. These are functions that measure the
value of a transition and generalise the concept of work beyond the model of a
lifted weight. We do so by imposing simple operational axioms that any
reasonable work quantifier must fulfil and by deriving from them stringent
mathematical condition with a clear physical interpretation. Our approach
allows us to derive much of the structure of the theory of thermodynamics
without taking as a primitive the definition of work. We can derive, for any
work quantifier, a quantitative second law in the sense of bounding the work
that can be performed using some non-equilibrium resource by the work that is
needed to create it. We also discuss in detail the role of reversibility and
correlations in connection with the second law. Furthermore, we recover the
usual identification of work with energy in degrees of freedom with vanishing
entropy as a particular case of our formalism. Our mathematical results can be
formulated abstractly and are general enough to carry over to other resource
theories than quantum thermodynamics.

developed that relies on the comparison of subspace dimensions without a need
to introduce thermo-majorisation used previously. Optimal single shot work for
processes where a weight transfers from (a) a single energy level to another
single energy level is then re-derived. In addition we discuss the final state
of the system after work extraction and show that the system typically ends in
its thermal state, while there are cases where the system is only close to it.
The work of formation in the single level transfer setting [1] is also
re-derived. The approach presented now allows the extension of the single shot
work concept to work extraction (b) involving multiple final levels of the
weight. A key conclusion here is that the single shot work for case (a) is
appropriate only when a \emph{resonance} of a particular energy is required.
When wishing to identify ""work extraction"" with finding the weight in a
specific available energy or any higher energy a broadening of the single shot

transfer-quantity allows us to formulate minimum requirements for
transformations to be at all possible in a thermodynamic framework. We show
that choosing the free energy difference of the weight as the transfer-quantity

that a macroscopic body can be decomposed into several smaller pieces, still
macroscopic, that become statistically independent due to the short-range
interaction nature of their constituent atoms. The ensuing main result is that
the quantum distributions of extensive variables of the body become
sharply-peaked. The center of mass variables are of this type and hence their
dynamics is essentially classical. We point out the crucial role played by the
external potential, in which the motion occurs, as the macroscopic agent that
executes the ""measurement"" process of the center of mass.

systems that automatically detect and repair bugs. One well-known class of bugs
is the infinite loop. Every computer programmer or user has, at least once,
experienced this type of bug. We state the problem of repairing infinite loops
in the context of test-suite based software repair: given a test suite with at
least one failing test, generate a patch that makes all test cases pass.
Consequently, repairing infinites loop means having at least one test case that
hangs by triggering the infinite loop. Our system to automatically repair
infinite loops is called $Infinitel$. We develop a technique to manipulate
loops so that one can dynamically analyze the number of iterations of loops;
decide to interrupt the loop execution; and dynamically examine the state of
the loop on a per-iteration basis. Then, in order to synthesize a new loop
condition, we encode this set of program states as a code synthesis problem
using a technique based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). We evaluate our
technique on seven seeded-bugs and on seven real-bugs. $Infinitel$ is able to
repair all of them, within seconds up to one hour on a standard laptop

the PLANCK measurement. We note that this dark matter is highly
singlino-dominated and is always accompanied by a pseudoscalar, $A_1$, with a

For two benchmark points from our scan, we then carry out a detector-level

second has higher velocity dispersion ($\bar \sigma \approx$ 200 km s$^{-1}$)

is double peaked, with redshifted and blueshifted components separated by

suggest the presence of a bipolar outflow for which we estimate a mass outflow

energy models, where the energies are given by the positions of the particles
of the complex-valued branching Brownian motion (BBM). Specifically, we provide
the weak limit theorems for the partition function in the so-called ""glassy
phase"" -- the regime of parameters, where the behaviour of the partition
function is governed by the extrema of BBM. We allow for arbitrary correlations
between the real and imaginary parts of the energies. This extends the recent
result of Madaule, Rhodes and Vargas, where the uncorrelated case was treated.
In particular, our result covers the case of the real-valued BBM energy model
at complex temperatures.

pulsating binary star can be obtained analytically, that is, without converting
time delays to radial velocities by numerical differentiation. Using the time
delays directly offers greater precision, and allows the parameters of much
smaller orbits to be derived. The method is applied to KIC9651065, KIC10990452,
and KIC8264492, and a set of the orbital parameters is obtained for each
system. Radial velocity curves for these stars are deduced from the orbital
elements thus obtained.

solving stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of magnetization dynamics

error-resilient switching of magnetization is possible in sub-nanosecond delay

can be operated by drawing energy from the environment without the need for an

featured in equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, without
being probed as to the detailed consequences of the time averaging procedure.
In this work we introduce and prove the need for a selective and non-uniform
time-sampling, whose form depends on the properties (whether thermalized or
not) of the bath. It is also applicable when an open microscopic sub-system is
coupled to another {\it finite} system. By use of a time-periodic minimal
coupling model between these two systems, we present detailed quantitative
consequences of time coarsening, which include initial state independence of
equilibration, deviations from long term averages, their environment size
dependence and the approach to classicality, as measured by a Leggett-Garg type
inequality. An interacting multiple qubit model affords comparison between the
time integrating procedure and the more conventional environment tracing
method.
