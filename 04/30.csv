  Modulation in Graphene with Multiple Magnetic Barriers","13 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The electronic and transport properties of graphene modulated by magnetic
barrier arrays are derived for finite temperature. Prominent conductance gaps,
originating from quantum interference effects are found in the periodic array
case. When a structural defect is inserted in the array, sharp defect modes of
high conductance appear within the conductance gaps. These modes can be shifted
by local doping in the defect region resulting into sensing of the chemical
molecules that adhere on the graphene sheet. In general it is found that
sensitivity is strongly dependent on temperature due to smoothing out of the
defect-induced peaks and transport gaps. This temperature dependence, however,
offers the added capability for sub-mK temperature sensing resolution, and thus
an opportunity towards ultra-sensitive combined electrochemical-calorimetric
sensing.

for $d\geq 3$. It is a long range model with two parameters $\alpha$ and
$\kappa$, where the non-negative parameter $\alpha$ measures the amount of
loops, and $\kappa$ plays the role of killing on vertices penalizing
($\kappa\geq 0$) or favoring ($\kappa<0$) appearance of large loops. We
consider the truncated loop cluster model formed by the Poisson point process
$\mathcal{L}_{\alpha,\leq m}$, which is the restriction of
$\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}$ on loops with at most $m$ jumps. We prove the existence
of percolation in a $2$-dimensional slab for the truncated loop model
$\mathcal{L}_{\alpha,\leq m}$ as long as the intensity parameter $\alpha$ is
strictly above the critical threshold of the non-truncated loop model and $m$
is large enough. We apply this result to prove the exponential decay of one arm
connectivity for the finite cluster at $0$ for the whole supercritical regime
of the non-truncated loop model. For $\kappa=0$, this loop percolation model
provides an example in which we have different behaviors of finite clusters in
sub-critical and super-critical regimes. Also, we deduce the strict increase of
the critical curve $\alpha\rightarrow\kappa_c(\alpha)$ for
$\alpha\geq\alpha_c$, where $\alpha_c$ is the critical value when $\kappa=0$.
In the end, we prove that $\forall\alpha>\alpha_c$ large balls in the infinite
cluster are finally very regular in the sense of \cite{Sapozhnikov2014}, which
implies that large balls are finally very good in the sense of
\cite{BarlowMR2094438}. By \cite{BarlowMR2094438} and
\cite{BarlowHamblyMR2471657}, we have Harnack's inequality and Gaussian type
estimate for simple random walks on the infinite cluster for all
$\alpha>\alpha_c$.

the guarantee of monotonic ascent in the matching score on the set of discrete

given a collection of score functions that map datasets to real values. It
attempts to return the name of the function with nearly minimum value on the

member stars in two recently discovered ultra-faint satellites Reticulum 2 and
Horologium 1, obtained as part of the ongoing Gaia-ESO Survey. We identify 18
members in Reticulum 2 and 5 in Horologium 1. We find Reticulum 2 to have a
velocity dispersion of ~3.22 km/s, implying a M/L ratio of ~ 500. We have
inferred stellar parameters for all candidates and we find Reticulum 2 to have
a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.46+/-0.1, with an intrinsic dispersion of ~
0.29, and is alpha-enhanced to the level of [alpha/Fe]~0.4. We conclude that
Reticulum 2 is a dwarf galaxy. We also report on the serendipitous discovery of
four stars in a previously unknown stellar substructure near Reticulum 2 with
[Fe/H] ~ -2 and V_hel ~ 220 km/s, far from the systemic velocity of Reticulum
2. For Horologium 1 we infer a velocity dispersion of 4.9^{+2.8}_{-0.9} km/s
and a consequent M/L ratio of ~ 600, leading us to conclude that Horologium 1
is also a dwarf galaxy. Horologium 1 is slightly more metal-poor than Reticulum
2 [Fe/H] = -2.76 +/- 0.1 and is similarly alpha-enhanced: [alpha/Fe] ~ 0.3.
Despite a large error-bar, we also measure a significant spread of
metallicities of 0.17 dex which strengthen the evidence that Horologium 1 is
indeed a dwarf galaxy. The line-of-sight velocity of Reticulum 2 is offset by
some 100 km/s from the prediction of the orbital velocity of the LMC, thus
making its association with the Cloud uncertain. However, at the location of
Horologium 1, both the backward integrated LMC's orbit and the LMC's halo are
predicted to have radial velocities similar to that of the dwarf. Therefore, it
is likely that Horologium 1 is or once was a member of the Magellanic Family.

excitation parameters as functions of hole parameters which are free on a line
segment in the complex plane. If $h$ is non-zero, on the other hand, a
remarkable restructuring occurs, and all parameters which enter the description

crystals is their high stretchability and the possibility to use external

physical properties of materials can be tuned by controlling the elastic strain
fields applied to it, has a perfect platform for its implementation in the
atomically thin semiconducting materials. The object of this review is to give
an overview of the recent progress to control the optical and electronics
properties of 2D crystals, by means of strain engineering. We will concentrate
on semiconducting layered materials, with especial emphasis in transition metal
dichalcogenides (MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$). The effect of strain
in other atomically thin materials like black phosphorus, silicene, etc., is
also considered. The benefits of strain engineering in 2D crystals for
applications in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics will be revised, and the
open problems in the field will be discussed.

explanation. As this gauge boson has to couple in a flavour non-universal way
to muons and electrons in order to explain $R_K$, it is interesting to examine
the possibility that also lepton flavour is violated, especially in the light
of the CMS excess in $h\to\tau^\pm\mu^\mp$. In this article, we investigate the
perspectives to discover the lepton-flavour violating modes $B\to
K^{(*)}\tau^\pm\mu^\mp$, $B_s\to \tau^\pm\mu^\mp$ and $B\to K^{(*)} \mu^\pm
e^\mp$, $B_s\to \mu^\pm e^\mp$. For this purpose we consider a simplified model
in which new-physics effects originate from an additional neutral gauge boson
($Z^\prime$) with generic couplings to quarks and leptons. The constraints from
$\tau\to3\mu$, $\tau\to\mu\nu\bar{\nu}$, $\mu\to e\gamma$, $g_\mu-2$,
semi-leptonic $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ decays, $B\to K^{(*)}\nu\nu$ and
$B_s$--$\overline{B}_s$ mixing are examined. From these decays, we determine
upper bounds on the decay rates of lepton flavour violating $B$ decays.
$Br(B\to K\nu\nu)$ limits the branching ratios of LFV $B$ decays to be smaller
than $8\times 10^{-5} (2\times 10^{-5})$ for vectorial (left-handed) lepton
couplings. However, much stronger bounds can be obtained by a combined analysis
of $B_s$--$\overline{B}_s$, $\tau\to3\mu$, $\tau\to\mu\nu\bar{\nu}$ and other
rare decays. The bounds depend on the amount of fine-tuning among the
contributions to $B_s$--$\overline{B}_s$ mixing. Allowing for a fine-tuning at
the percent level we find upper bounds of the order of $10^{-6}$ for branching
ratios into $\tau\mu$ final states, while $B_s\to \mu^\pm e^\mp$ is strongly
suppressed and only $B\to K^{(*)} \mu^\pm e^\mp$ can be experimentally
accessible (with a branching ratio of order $10^{-7}$).

orthogonal directions in materials that have significant spin-orbit
coupling.The efficiency of the conversion is described by the spin Hall Angle
(SHA). The SHA can most readily be inferred by using the generated spin
currents to excite or rotate the magnetization of ferromagnetic films or
nano-elements via spin-transfer torques.Some of the largest spin torque derived
spin Hall angles (ST-SHA) have been reported in platinum. Here we show, using
spin torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements, that the
transparency of the Pt-ferromagnet interface to the spin current plays a
central role in determining the magnitude of the ST-SHA. We measure a much
larger ST-SHA in Pt/cobalt (~0.11) compared to Pt/permalloy (~0.05) bilayers
when the interfaces are assumed to be completely transparent. Taking into
account the transparency of these interfaces, as derived from spin-mixing
conductances, we find that the intrinsic SHA in platinum has a much higher
value of 0.19 +- 0.04 as compared to the ST-SHA. The importance of the
interface transparency is further exemplified by the insertion of atomically
thin magnetic layers at the Pt/permalloy interface that we show strongly
modulates the magnitude of the ST-SHA.

of regions, a region-based packet routing called SmartRegion Routing is
presented. The flexibility of regions in terms of naming and addressing is then
leveraged in the form of a region stack among other features placed in the
associated packet header. In this way, most of complexity and dynamicity of a
network is absorbed, and therefore highly fast and simplified routing at the
inter-region level along with semi-autonomous intra-region routing will be
feasible. In addition, multipath planning can be naturally realized at both
inter and intra levels. A basic form of SmartRegion routing mechanism is
provided. Simplicity, scalability, and manageability of the proposed approach
would also bring future potentials to reduce energy consumption and
environmental footprint associated to the SDNs. Finally, various applications,
such as enabling seamless broadband access, providing beyond IP addressing
mechanisms, and also address-equivalent naming mechanisms, are considered and

state of one-dimensional classical lattice gases with long-range repulsive
convex interactions. Its plateaus mark regions of stability for specific
filling fractions which are controlled by a chemical potential. Typically such
staircase has an explicit particle-hole symmetry, i.e., the staircase at more
than half-filling can be trivially extracted from the one at less than half
filling by exchanging the roles of holes and particles. Here we introduce a
quantum spin chain with competing short-range attractive and long-range
repulsive interactions, i.e. a non-convex potential. In the classical limit the
ground state features generalized Wigner crystals that --- depending on the
filling fraction --- are either composed of dimer particles or dimer holes
which results in an emergent complete devil's staircase without explicit
particle-hole symmetry of the underlying microscopic model. In our system the
particle-hole symmetry is lifted due to the fact that the staircase is
controlled through a two-body interaction rather than a one-body chemical
potential. The introduction of quantum fluctuations through a transverse field
melts the staircase and ultimately makes the system enter a paramagnetic phase.
For intermediate transverse field strengths, however, we identify a region,
where the density-density correlations suggest the emergence of quasi
long-range order. We discuss how this physics can be explored with
Rydberg-dressed atoms held in a lattice.

develop at temperatures much higher than Tc. Their intensity increases smoothly
on cooling and shows no anomaly that might signify a Neel transition. The
system remains subcritical with spins correlated over only one and a half unit
cells normal to the planes. At low energies the short-range spin response is
static on the microvolt scale. The excitations out of this ground state give
rise to an overdamped spectrum with a relaxation rate of 3 meV. The transition
to the superconducting state below Tc has no effect on the spin correlations.
The elastic interplanar spin response extends over a length that grows weakly
but fails to diverge as doping is moved towards the superconducting critical
point. Any antiferromagnetic critical point likely lies outside the
superconducting dome. The observations suggest that conversion from Neel
long-range order to a spin glass texture is a prerequisite to formation of
paired superconducting charges. We show that while pc =0.052 is a critical

whether one access control system is capable of emulating another, thereby
comparing the expressive power of these systems. Unfortunately, the notions of
expressiveness simulation that have been explored vary widely, which makes it
difficult to compare results in the literature, and even leads to apparent
contradictions between results. Furthermore, some notions of expressiveness
simulation make use of non-determinism, and thus cannot be used to define
mappings between access control systems that are useful in practical scenarios.
In this work, we define the minimum set of properties for an *implementable*

in place of another. We then define a wide range of properties spread across
several dimensions that can be enforced on top of this minimum definition.
These properties define a taxonomy that can be used to separate and compare
existing notions of access control simulation, many of which were previously
incomparable. We position existing notions of simulation within our properties
lattice by formally proving each simulation's equivalence to a corresponding
set of properties. Lastly, we take steps towards bridging the gap between
theory and practice by exploring the systems implications of points within our

gauge bosons and one real, non-charged scalar field coupled to gravity in five
dimensions. The scalar potential is a simple exponential function of the scalar
field. The background metric resulting from solving the classical equations of
motion exhibits hyperscaling violation, at least at asymptotically large values
of the radial direction. We study the spectrum of scalar composite states of
the putative dual field theory by fluctuating the sigma-model scalars and
gravity, and discuss in which cases we find a parametrically light scalar state
in the spectrum. We model the spontaneous breaking of the (weakly coupled)
gauge symmetry to the diagonal subgroup by the choice of IR boundary
conditions. We compute the mass spectrum of spin-1 states, and the precision
electroweak parameter S as a function of the hyperscaling coefficient. We find
a general bound on the mass of the lightest spin-1 resonance, by requiring that
the indirect bounds on the precision parameters be satisfied, that implies that
precision electroweak physics excludes the possibility of a techni-rho meson
with mass lighter than several TeV.

time-averaged spectral analysis, we find strong evidence for relativistic
reflection from the inner accretion disk. We find that relativistic emission
arises from a highly ionized inner accretion disk with a steep emissivity
profile, which suggests an intense, compact illuminating source. We find a
preliminary, near-maximal black hole spin a>0.9 accounting for statistical and
systematic modeling errors. We find a relatively moderate reflection fraction
with respect to predictions for the lamp post geometry, in which the
illuminating corona is modeled as a point source. Through a time-resolved
spectral analysis, we find that modest coronal and inner disk reflection flux
variation drives the spectral variability during the observations. We discuss
various physical scenarios for the inner disk reflection model, and we find
that a compact corona is consistent with the observed features.

(SSR) and approximate Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP) on $n$-node $m$-edge
directed graphs under edge deletions (decremental algorithms). The previous
fastest algorithm for SSR and SSSP goes back three decades to Even and Shiloach
[JACM 1981]; it has $ O(1) $ query time and $ O (mn) $ total update time (i.e.,
linear amortized update time if all edges are deleted). This algorithm serves
as a building block for several other dynamic algorithms. The question whether
its total update time can be improved is a major, long standing, open problem.
  In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. We obtain a randomized
algorithm with an expected total update time of $ O(\min (m^{7/6} n^{2/3 +
o(1)}, m^{3/4} n^{5/4 + o(1)}) ) = O (m n^{9/10 + o(1)}) $ for SSR and
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate SSSP if the edge weights are integers from $ 1 $ to
$ W \leq 2^{\log^c{n}} $ and $ \epsilon \geq 1 / \log^c{n} $ for some constant
$ c $. We also extend our algorithm to achieve roughly the same running time
for Strongly Connected Components (SCC), improving the algorithm of Roditty and
Zwick [FOCS 2002]. Our algorithm is most efficient for sparse and dense graphs.
When $ m = \Theta(n) $ its running time is $ O (n^{1 + 5/6 + o(1)}) $ and when
$ m = \Theta(n^2) $ its running time is $ O (n^{2 + 3/4 + o(1)}) $. For SSR we
also obtain an algorithm that is faster for dense graphs and has a total update
time of $ O ( m^{2/3} n^{4/3 + o(1)} + m^{3/7} n^{12/7 + o(1)}) $ which is $ O
(n^{2 + 2/3}) $ when $ m = \Theta(n^2) $. All our algorithms have constant
query time in the worst case and are correct with high probability against an
oblivious adversary.

step to the next. The temporal graph exploration problem TEXP is the problem of
computing a foremost exploration schedule for a temporal graph, i.e., a
temporal walk that starts at a given start node, visits all nodes of the graph,
and has the smallest arrival time. In the first part of the paper, we consider
only undirected temporal graphs that are connected at each time step. For such
temporal graphs with $n$ nodes, we show that it is \NP-hard to approximate TEXP
with ratio $O(n^{1-\varepsilon})$ for every $\varepsilon>0$. We also provide an
explicit construction of temporal graphs that require $\Theta(n^2)$ time steps
to be explored. In the second part of the paper, we still consider temporal
graphs that are connected in each time step, but we assume that the underlying
graph (i.e. the graph that contains all edges that are present in the temporal
graph in at least one time step) belongs to a specific class of graphs. Among
other results, we show that temporal graphs can be explored in
$O(n^{1.5}k^{1.5}\log n)$ time steps if the underlying graph has treewidth $k$,
in $O(n^{1.8}\log n)$ time steps if the underlying graph is planar, and in
$O(n\log^3 n)$ time steps if the underlying graph is a $2\times n$ grid. In the
third part of the paper, we consider settings where the graphs in future time
steps are not known and the exploration schedule is constructed online. We
replace the connectedness assumption by a weaker assumption and show that
$m$-edge temporal graphs with regularly present edges and with
probabilistically present edges can be explored online in $O(m)$ time steps and
$O(m \log n)$ time steps with high probability, respectively. We finally show
that the latter result can be used to obtain a distributed algorithm for the
gossiping problem in random temporal graphs.

This Hamiltonian turns out to be nearly identical to graph energy in the

consequences. The Higgs model we discuss has two superconducting components and
an axion-like magnetoelectric term with the phase difference of the
superconducting order parameters playing the role of the axion field. Due to
this additional term, quantum electromagnetic and phase fluctuations lead to a
robust topologically non-trivial state that holds also in the presence of
interactions. In this sense, we show that the renormalization flow of the
topologically nontrivial phase cannot be continuously deformed into a
topologically non-trivial one. One consequence of our analysis of quantum
critical fluctuations, is the possibility of having a first-order phase
transition in the bulk and a second-order phase transition on the surface. We
also explore another consequence of the axionic Higgs electrodynamics, namely,
the anomalous Hall effect. In the low frequency London regime an anomalous Hall
effect is induced in the presence of an applied electric field parallel to the
surface. This anomalous Hall current is induced by a Lorentz-like force arising
from the axion term, and it involves the relative superfluid velocity of the
superconducting components. The anomalous Hall current has a negative sign, a
situation reminiscent of, but quite distinct in physical origin from the
anomalous Hall effect observed in high-$T_c$ superconductors. In contrast to
the latter, the anomalous Hall effect in topological superconductors is
non-dissipative and occurs in the absence of vortices.

nanostructured carbons to meet the targets set for on-board vehicular storage
to be viable. We show, using density functional theory calculations, that
replacing graphene by graphene oxide increases the adsorption energy of methane
by 50%. This enhancement is sufficient to achieve the optimal binding strength.
In order to gain insight into the sources of this increased binding, that could
also be used to formulate design principles for novel storage materials, we
consider a sequence of model systems, that progressively take us from graphene
to graphene oxide. A careful analysis of the various contributions to the weak
binding between the methane molecule and the graphene oxide shows that the
enhancement has important contributions from London dispersion interactions as
well as Debye interactions and higher-order electrostatic interactions, aided
by geometric curvature induced primarily by the presence of epoxy groups.

thought to orbit GJ 876 by computing the Bayes factors for a variety of
different coplanar models using an importance sampling algorithm. We find that
a four-planet model is preferred over a three-planet model. Next, we apply a
Newtonian MCMC algorithm to perform a Bayesian analysis of the planet masses
and orbits using an n-body model in three-dimensional space. Based on the
radial velocities alone, we find that a 99% credible interval provides upper
limits on the mutual inclinations for the three resonant planets
($\Phi_{cb}<6.20^\circ$ for the ""c"" and ""b"" pair and $\Phi_{be}<28.5^\circ$ for
the ""b"" and ""e"" pair). Subsequent dynamical integrations of our posterior
sample find that the GJ 876 planets must be roughly coplanar
($\Phi_{cb}<2.60^\circ$ and $\Phi_{be}<7.87^\circ$), suggesting the amount of
planet-planet scattering in the system has been low. We investigate the
distribution of the respective resonant arguments of each planet pair and find
that at least one argument for each planet pair and the Laplace argument
librate. The libration amplitudes in our three-dimensional orbital model

simulations of the stalled supernova shock in one-, two- (2D), and three
spatial dimensions (3D), we systematically probe the extent to which
hydrodynamic instabilities alone can tip the balance in favor of explosion. In
particular, we focus on systems that are well into the regimes where the
Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven convection
dominate the dynamics, and characterize the difference between them. We find
that SASI-dominated models can explode with up to ~20% lower neutrino
luminosity in 3D than in 2D, with the magnitude of this difference decreasing
with increasing resolution. This improvement in explosion conditions is related
to the ability of spiral modes to generate more non-radial kinetic energy than
a single sloshing mode, increasing the size of the average shock radius, and
hence generating better conditions for the formation of large-scale,
high-entropy bubbles. In contrast, convection-dominated explosions show a
smaller difference in their critical heating rate between 2D and 3D (<8%), in
agreement with previous studies. The ability of our numerical implementation to
maintain arbitrary symmetries is quantified with a set of SASI-based tests. We
discuss implications for the diversity of explosion paths in a realistic

results in the highest effectiveness for this search algorithm. From the 50 per
cent of data processed thus far, we have re-detected 435 previously known
pulsars and discovered a further 60 pulsars, two of which are fast-spinning
pulsars with periods less than 30ms. PSR J1101-6424 is a millisecond pulsar
whose heavy white dwarf (WD) companion and short spin period of 5.1ms indicate
a rare example of full-recycling via Case A Roche lobe overflow. PSR J1757-27
appears to be an isolated recycled pulsar with a relatively long spin period of
17ms. In addition, PSR J1244-6359 is a mildly-recycled binary system with a
heavy WD companion, PSR J1755-25 has a significant orbital eccentricity of
0.09, and PSR J1759-24 is likely to be a long-orbit eclipsing binary with
orbital period of the order of tens of years. Comparison of our
newly-discovered pulsar sample to the known population suggests that they
belong to an older population. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our current

~2.5 larger than those measured from stellar kinematics and that stronger bars
have enhanced influence on inner kinematic features. We detect that stellar
angular momentum ""dips"" at 0.2$\pm$0.1 bar lengths and half of our sample
exhibits an anti-correlation of h3 - stellar velocity (v/{\sigma}) in these

increasing bar strength supports the notion of bar-induced orbit mixing. These
measurements set important constraints on the spatial scales, namely an
increasing influence in the central regions (0.1-0.5 bar lengths), revealed by
kinematic signatures due to bar-driven secular evolution in present day

  At a spatial resolution of 1200 AU, the continuum substructures are resolved.
Extracting the spectra from individual substructures and providing the
intensity-integrated distribution map for each species, we studied the
small-scale chemical variations in this region. Our main results are: (1) We
identify lines from the low-abundance COMs CH3COCH3 and CH3CH2OH, as well as
tentatively detect CH3CHO and long carbon-chains C6H and HC7N. (2) We find that
while most COMs are segregated by type, peaking either towards the hot core
(e.g., N-bearing species) or the compact ridge (e.g., O-bearing species like
HCOOCH3 and CH3OCH3), while the distributions of others do not follow this
segregated structure (e.g., CH3CH2OH, CH3OH, CH3COCH3). (3) We find a second
velocity component of HNCO, SO2, 34SO2, and SO lines, which may be associated
with a strong shock event in the low-velocity outflow. (4) Temperatures and
molecular abundances show large gradients between central condensations and the
outflow regions, illustrating a transition between hot molecular core and
shock-chemistry dominated regimes.
  Our observations of spatially resolved chemical variations in Orion-KL
provide the nearest reference source for hot molecular core and outflow

simple analytic criterion for the occurrence of IMS is given in terms of their
self- and cross-interaction coefficients and non-interacting thresholds, which
is verified for the example of a two-dimensional microdisk laser. When the
spatial pump profile is varied as the pump power is increased, IMS can be
induced even when it would not occur with a fixed pump profile, as we show for
two coupled laser cavities. Our findings apply to steady-state lasing and are
hence different from dynamical mode switching or hopping. IMS may have

and Ilin \& Morgulis (2013) which arises when a radial crossflow is imposed on
a centrifugally-stable swirling flow. By finding a simpler rectilinear example
of the instability - a sheared half plane, the minimal ingredients for the
instability are identified and the destabilizing/stabilizing effect of
inflow/outflow boundaries clarified. The instability - christened `boundary
inflow instability' here - is of critical layer type where this layer is either
at the inflow wall and the growth rate is $O(\sqrt{\eta})$ (as found by Ilin \&
Morgulis 2013), or in the interior of the flow and the growth rate is $O(\eta
\log 1/\eta)$ where $\eta$ measures the (small) inflow-to-tangential-flow
ratio. The instability is robust to changes in the rotation profile even to
those which are very Rayleigh-stable and the addition of further physics such
as viscosity, 3-dimensionality and compressibility but is sensitive to the
boundary condition imposed on the tangential velocity field at the inflow
boundary. Providing the vorticity is not fixed at the inflow boundary, the
instability seems generic and operates by the inflow advecting vorticity
present at the boundary across the interior shear. Both the primary bifurcation
to 2D states and secondary bifurcations to 3D states are found to be
supercritical. Assuming an accretion flow driven by molecular viscosity only so
$\eta=O(Re^{-1})$, the instability is not immediately relevant for accretion
disks since the critical threshold is $O(Re^{-2/3})$ and the inflow boundary
conditions are more likely to be stress-free than non-slip. However, the
analysis presented here does highlight the potential for mass entering a disk
to disrupt the orbiting flow if this mass flux possesses vorticity.

are based on the MILES library and on corrections from theoretical stellar
spectra. The models employ recent [Mg/Fe] determinations for the MILES stars
and BaSTI scaled-solar and \alpha-enhanced isochrones. We compute models for a
suite of IMF shapes and slopes, covering a wide age/metallicity range. Using
BaSTI, we also compute ""base models"" matching The Galactic abundance pattern.
We confirm that the \alpha-enhanced models show a flux excess with respect to
the scaled-solar models blue-ward $\sim$4500\AA, which increases with age and
metallicity. We also confirm that both [MgFe] and [MgFe]' indices are
[\alpha/Fe]-insensitive. We show that the sensitivity of the higher order
Balmer lines to [\alpha/Fe] resides in their pseudo-continua, with narrower
index definitions yielding lower sensitivity. We confirm that the
\alpha-enhanced models yield bluer (redder) colours in the blue (red) spectral
range. To match optical colours of massive galaxies we require both
\alpha-enhancement and a bottom-heavy IMF. The comparison of Globular Cluster
line-strengths with our predictions match the [Mg/Fe] determinations from their
individual stars. We obtain good fits to both full spectra and indices of
galaxies with varying [\alpha/Fe]. Using thousands of SDSS galaxy spectra we
obtain a linear relation between a proxy for the abundance, [Z$_{\rm

[Mg/Fe] derived with models with varying abundance ([Mg/Fe]=0.59[Z$_{\rm

people write programs in. The prevalence of scripting languages in the world
suggests programming language interpreters are relatively easy to write. Users
of these languages lament their inability to analyze their code, therefore
programming language analyzers are not easy to write. This thesis investigates
a systematic method of creating abstract interpreters from traditional
interpreters, called Abstracting Abstract Machines.
  Abstract interpreters are difficult to develop due to technical, theoretical,
and pragmatic problems. Technical problems include engineering data structures
and algorithms. I show that modest and simple changes to the mathematical
presentation of abstract machines result in 1000 times better running time -
just seconds for moderately sized programs.
  In the theoretical realm, abstraction can make correctness difficult to
ascertain. I provide proof techniques for proving the correctness of regular,
pushdown, and stack-inspecting pushdown models of abstract computation by
leaving computational power to an external factor: allocation. Even if we don't
trust the proof, we can run models concretely against test suites to better
trust them.
  In the pragmatic realm, I show that the systematic process of abstracting
abstract machines is automatable. I develop a meta-language for expressing
abstract machines similar to other semantics engineering languages. The
language's special feature is that it provides an interface to abstract
allocation. The semantics guarantees that if allocation is finite, then the
semantics is a sound and computable approximation of the concrete semantics.

interest because of their remarkable predicted properties including protection
of quantum information and the emergence of Majorana fermions. Such QSLs,
however, have proven difficult to identify experimentally. The most promising
approach is to study their exotic nature via the wave-vector and intensity
dependence of their dynamical response in neutron scattering. A major search
has centered on iridate materials which are proposed to realize the celebrated
Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice - a prototypical topological QSL system in
two dimensions (2D). The difficulties of iridium for neutron measurements have,
however, impeded progress significantly. Here we provide experimental evidence
that a material based on ruthenium, {\alpha}-RuCl$_3$ realizes the same Kitaev
physics but is highly amenable to neutron investigation. Our measurements
confirm the requisite strong spin-orbit coupling, and a low temperature
magnetic order that matches the predicted phase proximate to the QSL. We also
show that stacking faults, inherent to the highly 2D nature of the material,
readily explain some puzzling results to date. Measurements of the dynamical
response functions, especially at energies and temperatures above that where
interlayer effects are manifest, are naturally accounted for in terms of
deconfinement physics expected for QSLs. Via a comparison to the recently

ubiquity of value-based overloading, where a given function can dynamically
reflect upon and behave according to the types of its arguments. Thus, to
establish basic types, the analysis must reason precisely about values, but in
the presence of higher-order functions and polymorphism, this reasoning itself
can require basic types. In this paper we address this chicken-and-egg problem
by introducing the framework of two-phased typing. The first ""trust"" phase
performs classical, i.e. flow-, path- and value-insensitive type checking to
assign basic types to various program expressions. When the check inevitably
runs into ""errors"" due to value-insensitivity, it wraps problematic expressions
with DEAD-casts, which explicate the trust obligations that must be discharged
by the second phase. The second phase uses refinement typing, a flow- and
path-sensitive analysis, that decorates the first phase's types with logical
predicates to track value relationships and thereby verify the casts and
establish other correctness properties for dynamically typed languages.

three resonant objects (>90%) spend a total of 10^7 years in resonance during
their 4.5 Gyr integrations; most clones experience multiple periods of

5:1 resonance, the scattering objects, and other large semi-major axis

been widely used as a measure of Doppler boosting of a quasar's radio jets and
hence of the inclination of the central engine's spin axis to the line of
sight. However, the use of the radio lobe luminosity in the denominator
(essentially to try and factor out the intrinsic power of the central engine)
has been criticized and other proxies for the intrinsic engine power have been
proposed. These include the optical continuum luminosity, and the luminosity of
the narrow-line region. Each is plausible, but so far none has been shown to be
clearly better than the others. In this paper we evaluate four different
measures of core dominance using a new sample of 126 radio loud quasars,
carefully selected to be as free as possible of orientation bias, together with
high quality VLA images and optical spectra from the SDSS. We find that
normalizing the radio core luminosity by the optical continuum luminosity
yields a demonstrably superior orientation indicator. In addition, by comparing
the equivalent widths of broad emission lines in our orientation-unbiased
sample to those of sources in the MOJAVE program, we show that the beamed
optical synchrotron emission from the jets is not a significant component of
the optical continuum for the sources in our sample. We also discuss future

that magnetic-field-aligned electric fields (E||) can be present over large
spatial scales in reconnection exhausts. The largest values of E|| are observed
within double layers. The existence of double layers in the Earth's
magnetosphere is well documented. In our simulation their formation is
triggered by large parallel streaming of electrons into the reconnection
region. These parallel electron fluxes are required for maintaining
quasi-neutrality of the reconnection region and increase with decreasing values
of the normalized electron pressure upstream of the reconnection region. A
threshold normalized pressure is derived for strong double layers to develop.
We also document how the electron confinement, provided in part by the
structure in E||, allows sustained energization by perpendicular electric
fields. The energization is a consequence of the confined electrons' chaotic
orbital motion that includes drifts aligned with the reconnection electric
field. The level of energization is proportional to the initial particle energy
and therefore is enhanced by the initial energy boost of the acceleration
potential, acquired by electrons entering the region. The mechanism is
effective in an extended region of the reconnection exhaust allowing for the
generation of superthermal electrons in reconnection scenarios, including those
with only a single x-line. An expression for the phase-space distribution of
the superthermal electrons is derived, providing an accurate match to the
kinetic simulation results. The numerical and analytical results agree with
detailed spacecraft observations recorded during reconnection events in the

  Uncertainty",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article presents a novel approach, named MCMP (Monte Carlo Motion
Planning), to the problem of motion planning under uncertainty, i.e., to the
problem of computing a low-cost path that fulfills probabilistic collision
avoidance constraints. MCMP estimates the collision probability (CP) of a given
path by sampling via Monte Carlo the execution of a reference tracking
controller (in this paper we consider LQG). The key algorithmic contribution of
this paper is the design of statistical variance-reduction techniques, namely
control variates and importance sampling, to make such a sampling procedure
amenable to real-time implementation. MCMP applies this CP estimation procedure
to motion planning by iteratively (i) computing an (approximately) optimal path
for the deterministic version of the problem (here, using the FMT* algorithm),
(ii) computing the CP of this path, and (iii) inflating or deflating the
obstacles by a common factor depending on whether the CP is higher or lower
than a target value. The advantages of MCMP are threefold: (i) asymptotic
correctness of CP estimation, as opposed to most current approximations, which,
as shown in this paper, can be off by large multiples and hinder the
computation of feasible plans; (ii) speed and parallelizability, and (iii)
generality, i.e., the approach is applicable to virtually any planning problem
provided that a path tracking controller and a notion of distance to obstacles
in the configuration space are available. Numerical results illustrate the
correctness (in terms of feasibility), efficiency (in terms of path cost), and
computational speed of MCMP.

variables, and subspace collections is explored. A new class of function,
superfunctions, are introduced which are the counterpart to functions at the
level of subspace collections. Operations on subspace collections are found to
correspond to various operations on rational functions, such as addition,
multiplication and substitution. It is established that every rational matrix
valued function which is homogeneous of degree 1 can be generated from an
appropriate, but not necessarily unique, subspace collection: the mapping from
subspace collections to rational functions is onto, but not one to one. For
some applications superfunctions may be more important than functions, as they
incorporate more information about the physical problem, yet can be manipulated
in much the same way as functions. Previously subspace collections had been
introduced when there was an inner product on the vector (or Hilbert) space,
and appropriate subspaces were mutually orthogonal. In that setting certain
normalization and reduction operations on subspace collections led to a
continued fraction expansion of the associated function, which allowed one to
bound the function in terms of a set of weight matrices and normalization
matrices that are derived from series expansions. Here we also initiate the
theory of normalization and reduction operations, appropriate when there is no
inner product on the space.

with an axisymmetric gravitational potential, we propose that spatially
dependent amplification of magnetic fields possibly explains the observed
noncircular motion of the gas in the Galactic center region. The radial
distribution of the rotation frequency in the bulge region is not monotonic in
general. The amplification of the magnetic field is enhanced in regions with
stronger differential rotation, because magnetorotational instability and
field-line stretching are more effective. The strength of the amplified
magnetic field reaches >~ 0.5 mG, and radial flows of the gas are excited by
the inhomogeneous transport of angular momentum through turbulent magnetic
field that is amplified in a spatially dependent manner. In addition, the
magnetic pressure-gradient force also drives radial flows in a similar manner.
As a result, the simulated position-velocity diagram exhibits a time-dependent
asymmetric parallelogram-shape owing to the intermittency of the magnetic
turbulence; the present model provides a viable alternative to the
bar-potential-driven model for the parallelogram-shape of the central molecular
zone. This is a natural extension into the central few 100 pc of the magnetic
activity, which is observed as molecular loops at radii from a few 100 pc to 1
kpc. Furthermore, the time-averaged net gas flow is directed outward, whereas
the flows are highly time-dependent, which we discuss from a viewpoint of the
outflow from the bulge.

This pattern is dominated by the small and large frequency separations between

because they give information about e.g. the evolutionary state and the mass of

  Aims. We want to develop a robust method to determine the large and small
frequency separations for time series with low signal-tonoise ratio. For this
purpose, we analyse a time series of the Sun from the GOLF instrument aboard
SOHO and a time series of the star KIC 5184732 from the NASA Kepler satellite

  Methods. We use the analytic signal of filtered stellar oscillation time
series to compute the signal envelope. Spectral analysis of the signal envelope
then reveals frequency differences of dominant modes in the periodogram of the
stellar time series.
  Results. With the described method the large frequency separation $\Delta\nu$
can be extracted from the envelope spectrum even for data of poor
signal-to-noise ratio. A modification of the method allows for an overview of
the regularities in the periodogram of the time series.

$\omega_{\rm p}/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} \sim$ 6.3. This large value is
rather favorable to the orbital-fluctuation mechanism of the superconductivity
with the so-called $S_{++}$ symmetry. In the phonon measurements, we observed
slight softening of the in-plane transverse acoustic mode corresponding to the
elastic constant $C_{66}$. This softening starts at $T$ well above the
superconducting $T_{\rm c}$, as $T$ decreases. An anomalously large increase in
the phonon spectral weight of in-plane optical modes was observed in the range

Because this $\omega$ region mainly corresponds to the in-plane vibrations of
Fe atoms, the finding presents information on the coupling between the orbital
fluctuation of the Fe 3$d$ electrons and lattice system, useful for studying
possible roles of the orbital fluctuation in the pairing mechanism and
appearance of the so-called nematic phase.

the solar convection zone; however, because of its relatively small amplitude,
precisely measuring it poses a significant challenge. Here we present a
complete time-distance helioseismic analysis of about two years of ground-based
GONG Doppler data to retrieve the meridional circulation profile for modest
latitudes, in an attempt to corroborate results from other studies. We use an
empirical correction to the travel times due to an unknown center-to-limb
systematic effect. The helioseismic inversion procedure is first tested and
reasonably validated on artificial data from a large-scale numerical
simulation, followed by a test to broadly recover the solar differential
rotation found from global seismology.
  From GONG data, we measure poleward photospheric flows at all latitudes with
properties that are comparable with earlier studies, and a shallow equatorward
flow about $65$\,Mm beneath the surface, in agreement with recent findings from
HMI data. No strong evidence of multiple circulation cells in depth nor
latitude is found, yet the whole phase space has not yet been explored. Tests
of mass flux conservation are then carried out on the inferred GONG and HMI
flows and compared to a fiducial numerical baseline from models, and we find
that the continuity equation is poorly satisfied.
  While the two disparate data sets do give similar results for about the outer
$15\%$ of the interior radius, the total inverted circulation pattern appears
to be unphysical in terms of mass conservation when interpreted over modest
time scales. We can likely attribute this to both the influence of realization
noise and subtle effects in the data and measurement procedure.

and theoretical characteristics of isolated and binary magnetic white dwarfs
(MWDs).
  Magnetic fields of isolated MWDs are observed to lie in the range 10^3-10^9G.
While the upper limit cutoff appears to be real, the lower limit is more
difficult to investigate. The incidence of magnetism below a few 10^3G still
needs to be established by sensitive spectropolarimetric surveys conducted on
8m class telescopes.
  Highly magnetic WDs tend to exhibit a complex and non-dipolar field structure
with some objects showing the presence of higher order multipoles. There is no
evidence that fields of highly magnetic WDs decay over time, which is
consistent with the estimated Ohmic decay times scales of ~10^11 yrs. MWDs, as
a class, also appear to be more massive than their weakly or non-magnetic
counterparts.
  MWDs are also found in binary systems where they accrete matter from a
low-mass donor star. These binaries, called magnetic Cataclysmic Variables
(MCVs) and comprise about 20-25\% of all known CVs. Zeeman and cyclotron
spectroscopy of MCVs have revealed the presence of fields in the range $\sim
7-230$\,MG. Complex field geometries have been inferred in the high field MCVs
(the polars) whilst magnetic field strength and structure in the lower field
group (intermediate polars, IPs) are much harder to establish.
  The origin of fields in MWDs is still being debated. While the fossil field
hypothesis remains an attractive possibility, field generation within the
common envelope of a binary system has been gaining momentum, since it would
explain the absence of MWDs paired with non-degenerate companions and also the
lack of relatively wide pre-MCVs.

at the fossil field hypothesis which links magnetism in compact stars to
magnetism in main sequence and pre-main sequence stars and we consider why its
feasibility has now been questioned particularly in the context of highly
magnetic white dwarfs. We also review the fossil versus dynamo debate in the
context of neutron stars and the roles played by key physical processes such as
buoyancy, helicity, and superfluid turbulence,in the generation and stability

unprocessed astrophysical ices at low temperature (H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$) and
bombarded ices (H$_2$O:CO$_2$) by high energy CRs. Evidences of the ice

receivers to adjust their load resistance independently in an iterative manner.
Last, we characterize the power region that constitutes all the achievable
power-tuples of the loads via controlling their adjustable resistance. In
particular, we compare the power regions without versus with the time sharing
of users' power transmission, where it is shown that time sharing yields a
larger power region in general. Extensive simulation results are provided to
validate our analysis and corroborate our study on the multiuser MRC-WPT

and demonstrate it using self-consistent 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics
simulations, including thermal conduction along magnetic fields and optically
thin radiative cooling. The model enables us to form cool dense plasma clouds
inside a flux rope by radiative condensation, which is regarded as an
inverse-polarity prominence. Radiative condensation is triggered by changes in
the magnetic topology, i.e., formation of the flux rope from the sheared arcade
field, and by thermal imbalance due to the dense plasma trapped inside the flux
rope. The flux rope is created by imposing converging and shearing motion on
the arcade field. Either when the footpoint motion is in the anti-shearing
direction or when heating is proportional to local density, the thermal state
inside the flux rope becomes cooling-dominant, leading to radiative
condensation. By controlling the temperature of condensation, we investigate
the relationship between the temperature and density of prominence and derive a
scaling formula for this relationship. This formula suggests that the proposed
model reproduce the observed density of prominence, which is 10-100 times
larger than the coronal density. Moreover, the time evolution of the extreme
ultraviolet emission synthesized by combining our simulation results with the
response function of the Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly filters agrees with the observed temporal and spatial intensity shift
among multi-wavelength during in-situ condensation.

with (Cn; ln jzj), one defines the space of polynomials on a S- parabolic
manifold (X; p) as the set of all analytic functions with polynomial growth
with respect to p. In this work, which is, in a sense continuation of [7], we
will primarily study polynomials on S-parabolic Stein manifolds. In Section 2,
we review different notions of paraboliticity for Stein manifolds, look at some
examples and go over the connections between parabolicity of a Stein manifold X
and certain linear topological properties of the Fr\'echet space of global
analytic functions on X. In Section 4 we construct an example of a S-parabolic
manifold, with no nontrivial polynomials. This example leads us to divide
S-parabolic manifolds into two groups as the ones whose class of polynomials is
dense in the corresponding space of analytic functions and the ones whose class
of polynomials is not so rich. In this way we introduce a new notion of
regularity for S-parabolic manifolds. In the final section we investigate
linear topolog- ical properties of regular S-parabolic Stein manifolds and show
in particular that the space of analytic functions on such manifolds have a
basis consisting of polynomials. We also give a criterion for closed
submanifolds of a regular S-parabolic to be regular S-parabolic, in terms of
existence of tame extension operators for the spaces of analytic functions
defined on these submanifolds.

Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation, we have computed the
evolution of the dust in a quasi-static gas density structure typical of
self-gravitating disc. For different grain size distributions we have
investigated the capability of spiral arms to trap particles. We have run 3D
radiative transfer simulations in order to construct maps of the expected
emission at (sub-)millimetre and near-infrared wavelengths. Finally, we have
simulated realistic observations of our disc models at (sub-)millimetre and
near-infrared wavelengths as they may appear with the Atacama Large
Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) and the High-Contrast Coronographic
Imager for Adaptive Optics (HiCIAO) in order to investigate whether there are
observational signatures of the spiral structure. We find that the pressure
inhomogeites induced by gravitational instabilities produce a non-negligible
dynamical effect on centimetre sized particles leading to significant
overdensities in spiral arms. We also find that the spiral structure is readily
detectable by ALMA over a wide range of (sub-)millimetre wavelengths and by
HiCIAO in near-infrared scattered light for non-face-on discs located in the
Ophiucus star-forming region. In addition, we find clear spatial spectral index
variations across the disc, revealing that the dust trapping produces a
migration of large grains that can be potentially investigated through
multi-wavelenghts observations in the (sub-)millimetric. Therefore, the spiral
arms observed to date in protoplanetary disc might be interpreted as density
waves induced by the development of gravitational instabilities.

own identity for security-related applications whereas other applications, in

$\partial_{t}^{k} F(t, x)$ includes the original Takagi function and some

the framework of off-shell formulations for supergravity in diverse dimensions
using the case of 3D N=2 supergravity theories as an illustrative example. This
geometric formalism has several advantages over other approaches advocated in
the last four years. Firstly, the infinitesimal isometry transformations of a
given curved superspace form, by construction, a finite-dimensional Lie
superalgebra, with its odd part corresponding to the rigid supersymmetry
transformations. Secondly, the generalised Killing spinor equation, which must
be obeyed by the supersymmetry parameters, is a consequence of the more
fundamental superfield Killing equation. Thirdly, general rigid supersymmetric
theories on a curved spacetime are readily constructed in superspace by making
use of the known off-shell supergravity-matter couplings and restricting them
to the background chosen. It is the superspace techniques which make it
possible to generate arbitrary off-shell supergravity-matter couplings.
Fourthly, all maximally supersymmetric Lorentzian spaces correspond to those
off-shell supergravity backgrounds for which the Grassmann-odd components of
the superspace torsion and curvature tensors vanish, while the Grassmann-even
components of these tensors are annihilated by the spinor derivatives.

high precision and regularity. This remarkable stability is frequently counter
to modelers' experience with the inherent stochasticity of chemical reactions
in the regime of low copy numbers. Moreover, the effects of noise and
nonlinearities can lead to ""counter-intuitive"" behavior, as demonstrated for a
basic enzymatic reaction scheme that can display stochastic focusing (SF).
Under the assumption of rapid signal fluctuations, SF has been shown to convert
a graded response into a threshold mechanism, thus attenuating the detrimental
effects of signal noise. However, when the rapid fluctuation assumption is
violated, this gain in sensitivity is generally obtained at the cost of very
large product variance, and this unpredictable behavior may be one possible
explanation of why, more than a decade after its introduction, SF has still not
been observed in real biochemical systems.
  In this work we explore the noise properties of a simple enzymatic reaction
mechanism with a small and fluctuating number of active enzymes that behaves as
a high-gain, noisy amplifier due to SF caused by slow enzyme fluctuations. We
then show that the inclusion of a plausible negative feedback mechanism turns
the system from a noisy signal detector to a strong homeostatic mechanism by
exchanging high gain with strong attenuation in output noise and robustness to
parameter variations. Moreover, we observe that the discrepancy between
deterministic and stochastic descriptions of stochastically focused systems in
the evolution of the means almost completely disappears, despite very low
molecule counts and the additional nonlinearity due to feedback.
  The reaction mechanism considered here can provide a possible resolution to
the apparent conflict between intrinsic noise and high precision in critical
intracellular processes.

ethanol solution as well as the server charge recombination on the surface of
the Au NRs otherwise they would bring forward serious reduction in open circuit
voltage when incorporating the Au NRs at the positions in contact with the
active materials. As a result, while the high open circuit voltage being
maintained, the optimized plasmonic OSCs possess an increased short circuit
current, and correspondingly an elevated power conversion efficiency with the
enhancement factor of ~11%. The origin of performance improvement in OSCs with
the Au@SiO2 NRs was analyzed systematically using morphological, electrical,
optical characterizations along with theoretical simulation. It is found that
the broadband enhancement in absorption, which yields the broadband enhancement
in exciton generation in the active layer, is the major factor contributing to
the increase in the short circuit current density. Simulation results suggest
that the excitation of the transverse and longitudinal surface plasmon
resonances of individual NRs as well as their mutual coupling can generate
strong electric field near the vicinity of the NRs, thereby an improved exciton
generation profile in the active layer. The incorporation of Au@SiO2 NRs at the
interface between the hole transporting layer and the active layer also
improves hole extraction in the OSCs.

condensation cycles of the plasma: thermal non-equilibrium (TNE). This
phenomenon is believed to play a role in the formation of prominences and
coronal rain. However, it is often discarded to be involved in the heating of
warm loops as the models do not reproduce observations. Recent simulations have
shown that these inconsistencies with observations may be due to
oversimplifications of the geometries of the models. In addition, our recent
observations reveal that long-period intensity pulsations (several hours) are
common in solar coronal loops. These periods are consistent with those expected
from TNE. The aim of this paper is to derive characteristic physical properties
of the plasma for some of these events to test the potential role of TNE in
loop heating. We analyzed three events in detail using the six EUV coronal
channels of SDO/AIA. We performed both a Differential Emission Measure (DEM)
and a time-lag analysis, including a new method to isolate the relevant signal
from the foreground and background emission. For the three events, the DEM
undergoes long-period pulsations, which is a signature of periodic heating even
though the loops are captured in their cooling phase, as is the bulk of the
active regions. We link long-period intensity pulsations to new signatures of
loop heating with strong evidence for evaporation and condensation cycles. We
thus witness simultaneously widespread cooling and TNE. Finally, we discuss the
implications of our new observations for both static and impulsive heating
models.

(Alekseechkin, 2014) is extended to binary case; the droplet volume V,
composition x, and temperature T are the variables of the theory. An approach
based on macroscopic kinetics (in contrast to the standard microscopic model of
nucleation operating with the probabilities of monomer attachment and
detachment) is developed for the droplet evolution and results in the derived
droplet motion equations in the space (V,x,T) - equations for V_dot, x_dot, and
T_dot. The work W(V,x,T) of the droplet formation is calculated; it is obtained
in the vicinity of the saddle point as a quadratic form with diagonal matrix.
Also the problem of generalizing the single-component Kelvin equation for the
equilibrium vapor pressure to binary case is solved; it is presented here as a
problem of integrability of a Pfaffian equation. The equation for is shown to
be the first law of thermodynamics for the droplet, which is a consequence of
Onsagers reciprocal relations and the linked-fluxes concept. As an example of
ideal solution for demonstrative numerical calculations, the o-xylene-m-xylene
system is employed. Both nonisothermal and enrichment effects are shown to
exist; the mean steady-state overheat of droplets and their mean steady-state
enrichment are calculated with the help of the 3D distribution function. The
qualitative peculiarities of the nucleation thermodynamics and kinetics in the
water-sulfuric acid system are considered in the model of regular solution. It
is shown that there is a small kinetic parameter in the theory due to the small
amount of the acid in the vapor and, as a consequence, the nucleation process
is isothermal.

low-dimensional features with orthogonal projections. Multilinear PCA methods
extend PCA to deal with multidimensional data (tensors) directly via
tensor-to-tensor projection or tensor-to-vector projection (TVP). However,
under the TVP setting, it is difficult to develop an effective multilinear PCA
method with the orthogonality constraint. This paper tackles this problem by
proposing a novel Semi-Orthogonal Multilinear PCA (SO-MPCA) approach. SO-MPCA
learns low-dimensional features directly from tensors via TVP by imposing the
orthogonality constraint in only one mode. This formulation results in more
captured variance and more learned features than full orthogonality. For better
generalization, we further introduce a relaxed start (RS) strategy to get
SO-MPCA-RS by fixing the starting projection vectors, which increases the bias
and reduces the variance of the learning model. Experiments on both face (2D)
and gait (3D) data demonstrate that SO-MPCA-RS outperforms other competing
algorithms on the whole, and the relaxed start strategy is also effective for
other TVP-based PCA methods.

an event-driven technique. Based on this, the mean of the random reward

state method. Here, as a step towards practical QKD, we show that a similar
conclusion is reached in the finite-key regime, even when the intensity of the
light source is unstable. More concretely, we derive security bounds for a wide
class of realistic light sources and show that the bounds are also efficient in
the presence of high channel loss. Our results strongly suggest the feasibility
of long distance provably-secure communication with imperfect light sources.

Remarkably, this simpler constraint can be regarded as that of a flat

the ejection time growing linearly with the lengths of different polymers.

negligible or not compared to the mean time to reach $n$ from infinity. In the
first regime, the coming down from infinity is very fast and the convergence is
weak. In the second regime, the coming down from infinity is gradual and a law
of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the hitting times sequence
hold. By an inversion procedure, we deduce that the process is a.s. equivalent

each party, the hCHSH-$d$ inequality involves $2d$ observables. We explain how
the parties can measure these observables and thus are able to check the
violation of hCHSH-$d$. In the presence of noise, this violation allows the

central engine has stopped at an early stage of its evolution ($t = t_j
\lesssim 10^5$ yr). To this aim, we theoretically evaluate the evolution of the
emission from both the lobe and the shell, which are composed of shocked jet
matter and a shocked ambient medium, respectively. Based on a simple dynamical
model of expanding lobe and shell, we clarify how the broadband spectrum of
each component evolves before and after the cessation of the jet activity. It
is shown that the spectrum is strongly dominated by the lobe emission while the
jet is active ($t \leq t_j$). On the other hand, once the jet activity has
ceased ($t > t_j$), the lobe emission fades out rapidly, since fresh electrons
are no longer supplied from the jet. Meanwhile, shell emission only shows a
gradual decrease, since accelerated electrons are continuously supplied from
the bow shock that is propagating into the ambient medium. As a result, overall
emission from the shell overwhelms that from the lobe at wide range of
frequencies from radio up to gamma-ray soon after the jet activity has ceased.
Our result predicts a new class of dead radio sources that are dominated by
shell emission. We suggest that the emission from the shell can be probed in
particular at a radio wavelengths with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) phase

This means that conventional evaluation methodologies are only applicable in

Given this setting, one important issue is how to evaluate algorithms in such a
streaming data environment. In this paper we propose a prequential evaluation
protocol for recommender systems, suitable for streaming data environments, but
also applicable in stationary settings. Using this protocol we are able to
monitor the evolution of algorithms' accuracy over time. Furthermore, we are
able to perform reliable comparative assessments of algorithms by computing
significance tests over a sliding window. We argue that besides being suitable
for streaming data, prequential evaluation allows the detection of phenomena
that would otherwise remain unnoticed in the evaluation of both offline and

stacking models trained on larger corpora on top of RNC models improves

emphasis on the use of electronic multipoles that have universal appeal,
because they are amenable to calculation and appear in theories of many other
experimental techniques. The conventional theory of magnetic neutron
scattering, which dates back to Schwinger (1937) and Trammell (1953), yields an
approximation for the scattering amplitude in terms of magnetic dipoles formed
with the spin (S) and orbital angular momentum (L) of valence electrons. The
so-called dipole-approximation has been widely adopted by researchers during
the past few decades that has seen neutron scattering develop to its present
status as the method of choice for investigations of magnetic structure and
excitations. Looking beyond the dipole-approximation, however, reveals a wealth
of additional information about electronic degrees of freedom conveniently
encapsulated in magnetic multipoles. In this language, the dipole-approximation
retains electronic axial dipoles, S and L. At the same level of approximation
are polar dipoles - called anapoles or toroidal dipoles - allowed in the
absence of a centre of inversion symmetry. Anapoles are examples of
magneto-electric multipoles, time-odd and parity-odd irreducible tensors, that
have come to the fore as signatures of electronic complexity in materials.

algebra on finite-dimensional diffeological vector spaces. We consider the
diffeological dual formally checking that the assignment to each space of its
dual defines a covariant functor from the category of finite-dimensional
diffeological vector spaces to the category of standard (that is, carrying the
usual smooth structure) vector spaces. We verify that the diffeological tensor
product enjoys the typical properties of the usual tensor product, after which
we focus on the so-called smooth direct sum decompositions, a phenomenon
exclusive to the diffeological setting. We then consider the so-called
pseudo-metrics (diffeological analogues of scalar products), and discuss the
consequent decompositions of vector spaces into a smooth direct sum of the
maximal isotropic subspace and a characteristic subspace; we show that such a
decomposition actually depends only on the choice of the coordinate system.
Furthermore, we show that, contrary to what was erroneously claimed (by me)
elsewhere, a characteristic subspace is not unique and is not invariant under
the diffeomorphisms of the space on itself. The maximal isotropic subspace is
on the other hand an invariant of the space itself, and this fact allows to
assign to each its well-defined characteristic quotient, obtaining another
functor, this time a contravariant one, to the category of standard vector
spaces. After discussing the diffeological analogues of isometries, we end with
some remarks concerning diffeological algebras and diffeological Clifford
algebras. Perhaps a larger than usual part of the paper recalls statements that
already appear elsewhere, but when this is the case, we try to accompany them

mean-field approach, we treat each double-well unit of two lattice sites as a

some residual correlations in each two-site unit. For a unbiased BHL, in
addition to conventional superfluid phase and integer Mott insulator phases, we
find that there are exotic fractional insulator phases if the inter-chain
tunneling is much stronger than the intra-chain one. The fractional insulator
phases can not be found by using a conventional mean-field treatment based upon
the single-site Gutzwiller ansatz. For a biased BHL, we find there appear
single-atom tunneling and interaction blockade if the system is dominated by
the interplay between the on-site interaction and the inter-chain bias. In the

regularized kernel-based methods, where, adopting the recently introduced
stable spline kernel, prior information on the unknown process is enforced.
This reduces the variance of the estimates and thus makes kernel-based methods
particularly attractive when few input-output data samples are available. In
such cases however, the influence of the system initial conditions may have a
significant impact on the output dynamics. In this paper, we specifically
address this point. We propose three methods that deal with the estimation of
initial conditions using different types of information. The methods consist in
various mixed maximum likelihood--a posteriori estimators which estimate the
initial conditions and tune the hyperparameters characterizing the stable
spline kernel. To solve the related optimization problems, we resort to the
expectation-maximization method, showing that the solutions can be attained by
iterating among simple update steps. Numerical experiments show the advantages,
in terms of accuracy in reconstructing the system impulse response, of the
proposed strategies, compared to other kernel-based schemes not accounting for
the effect initial conditions.

precise estimate of non-vanishing CP asymmetry ($\epsilon_{CP}$) in
leptogenesis and baryon asymmetry ($\eta_{B}$) in baryogenesis scenario
respectively. Further assuming the conformal invariance to be restored after
inflation in the framework of RSII, I have explicitly shown that the
requirement of the sub-dominant feature of large scale coherent magnetic field
after inflation gives two fold non-trivial characteristic constraints- on
equation of state parameter ($w$) and the corresponding energy scale during

contribution of back-reaction from the magnetic field I have established a
bound on the generic reheating characteristic parameter ($R_{rh}$) and its
rescaled version ($R_{sc}$), to achieve large scale magnetic field within the
prescribed setup and further apply the CMB constraints as obtained from
recently observed Planck 2015 data and Planck+BICEP2+Keck Array joint

to put further stringent constraints on various classes of large and small

unidimensional mean-payoff objectives and they showed membership of the problem

  We show by deriving an entropy-entropy dissipation estimate that for any

shown to be true even in cases when the diffusion coefficients all but one

  For non-weakly reversible networks consisting of source, transmission and

to a target component converge to the corresponding positive equilibria, which
are determined by the dynamics of the target component and the mass injected

7000 stars, almost 2000 of them with polarization signal-to-noise ratio larger
than 5. These data cover almost the entire main molecular cloud and also sample
two diffuse infrared patches in the neighborhood of Lupus I. The large scale
pattern of the plane-of-sky projection of the magnetic field is perpendicular
to the main axis of Lupus I, but parallel to the two diffuse infrared patches.
A detailed analysis of our polarization data combined with the Herschel/SPIRE
350 um dust emission map shows that the principal filament of Lupus I is
constituted by three main clumps acted by magnetic fields having different
large-scale structure properties. These differences may be the reason for the
observed distribution of pre- and protostellar objects along the molecular
cloud and its apparent evolutive stage. On the other hand, assuming that the
magnetic field is composed by a large-scale and a turbulent components, we find
that the latter is rather similar in all three clumps. The estimated
plane-of-sky component of the large-scale magnetic field ranges from about 70
uG to 200 uG in these clumps. The intensity increases towards the Galactic
plane. The mass-to-magnetic flux ratio is much smaller than unity, implying
that Lupus I is magnetically supported on large scales.

nova rate of $13.8 \pm 2.6$ per year. This measurement is much more accurate

sensitive to the frequently erupting recurrent novae. We did not find any

Missions considered are: single-pupil coronagraphs with a 2.4 m primary mirror,
and formation flying interferometers with 4 x 0.75 m collecting mirrors. The
numbers of accessible planets are calculated as a function of {\eta}earth. When
Kepler gives its final estimation for {\eta}earth, the model will permit a
precise assessment of the potential of each instrument. Based on current
estimations, {\eta}earth = 10% around FGK stars and 50% around M stars, the
coronagraph could study in spectroscopy only ~1.5 relevant planets, and the
interferometer ~14.0. These numbers are obtained under the major hypothesis
that the exozodiacal light around the target stars is low enough for each
instrument. In both cases, a prior detection of planets is assumed and a target
list established. For the long-term future, building both types of
spectroscopic instruments, and using them on the same targets, will be the
optimal solution because they provide complementary information. But as a first
affordable space mission, the interferometer looks the more promising in term

with experimental observations, that adhesion is always destroyed by roughness
except if the amplitude of the same is extremely small, and the materials are
particularly soft. This happens for all fractal dimensions. However, these
theories are limited due to the geometrical simplification, which may be
particularly strong in conditions near full contact. We introduce therefore a
simple model for adhesion, which aims at being rigorous near full contact,
where we postulate there are only small isolated gaps between the two bodies.
The gaps can be considered as ""pressurized cracks"" by using Ken Johnson's idea
of searching a corrective solution to the full contact solution. The solution
is an extension of the adhesive-less solution proposed recently by Xu, Jackson,
and Marghitu (XJM model) (2014). This process seems to confirm recent theories
using the JKR theory, namely that the effect of adhesion depends critically on
the fractal dimension. For D<2.5, the case which includes the vast majority of
natural surfaces, there is an expected strong effect of adhesion. Only for
large fractal dimensions, D>2.5, seems for large enough magnifications that a
full fractal roughness completely destroys adhesion. These results are partly
paradoxical since strong adhesion is not observed in nature except in special
cases. A possible way out of the paradox may be that the conclusion is relevant
for the near full contact regime, where the strong role of flaws at the
interfaces, and of gaps full of contaminant, trapped air or liquid in pressure,
needs to be further explored. If conditions near full contact are not achieved
on loading, probably the conclusions of classical asperity theories may be
confirmed.

solving continuous optimization problems. In the literature, the potential of
the particles of swarm has been used to show that slightly modified PSO
guarantees convergence to local optima. Here we show that under specific
circumstances the unmodified PSO, even with swarm parameters known (from the
literature) to be good, almost surely does not yield convergence to a local
optimum is provided. This undesirable phenomenon is called stagnation. For this
purpose, the particles' potential in each dimension is analyzed mathematically.
Additionally, some reasonable assumptions on the behavior if the particles'
potential are made. Depending on the objective function and, interestingly, the
number of particles, the potential in some dimensions may decrease much faster
than in other dimensions. Therefore, these dimensions lose relevance, i.e., the
contribution of their entries to the decisions about attractor updates becomes
insignificant and, with positive probability, they never regain relevance. If
Brownian Motion is assumed to be an approximation of the time-dependent drop of
potential, practical, i.e., large values for this probability are calculated.
Finally, on chosen multidimensional polynomials of degree two, experiments are
provided showing that the required circumstances occur quite frequently.
Furthermore, experiments are provided showing that even when the very simple
sphere function is processed the described stagnation phenomenon occurs.
Consequently, unmodified PSO does not converge to any local optimum of the
chosen functions for tested parameter settings.

networks. Initially, sensors obtain inaccurate estimations of an external time
reference and subsequently collaborate in order to synchronize their internal

assumption, where internal clocks are assumed to tick at the same pace. Hence,
the problem is reduced to an estimation problem, in which the sensors need to
estimate the initial external time. This work is further relevant to the
problem of collective approximation of environmental values by biological
groups.
  Unlike most works on clock synchronization that assume static networks, this
paper focuses on an extreme case of highly dynamic networks. Specifically, we
assume a non-adaptive scheduler adversary that dictates in advance an
arbitrary, yet independent, meeting pattern. Such meeting patterns fit, for
example, with short-time scenarios in highly dynamic settings, where each
sensor interacts with only few other arbitrary sensors.
  We propose an extremely simple clock synchronization algorithm that is based
on weighted averages, and prove that its performance on any given independent
meeting pattern is highly competitive with that of the best possible algorithm,
which operates without any resource or computational restrictions, and knows
the meeting pattern in advance. In particular, when all distributions involved
are Gaussian, the performances of our scheme coincide with the optimal
performances. Our proofs rely on an extensive use of the concept of Fisher

theory. However, bribery with money is often illegal in elections. Motivated by
this, we introduce the notion of frugal bribery and formulate two new pertinent
computational problems which we call Frugal-bribery and Frugal- $bribery to
capture bribery without money in elections. In the proposed model, the briber
is frugal in nature and this is captured by her inability to bribe votes of a
certain kind, namely, non-vulnerable votes. In the Frugal-bribery problem, the
goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only
vulnerable votes. In the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem, the vulnerable votes
have prices and the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by
changing only vulnerable votes, subject to a budget constraint of the briber.
We further formulate two natural variants of the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem
namely Uniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery and Nonuniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery
where the prices of the vulnerable votes are, respectively, all the same or
different.
  We study the computational complexity of the above problems for unweighted
and weighted elections for several commonly used voting rules. We observe that,
even if we have only a small number of candidates, the problems are intractable
for all voting rules studied here for weighted elections, with the sole
exception of the Frugal-bribery problem for the plurality voting rule. In
contrast, we have polynomial time algorithms for the Frugal-bribery problem for
plurality, veto, k-approval, k-veto, and plurality with runoff voting rules for
unweighted elections. However, the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem is
intractable for all the voting rules studied here barring the plurality and the

cosmic-ray sources on the flux of various cosmic-ray nuclei throughout our

sun and at different positions within the Galaxy. The modelling is performed
using the recently introduced numerical cosmic ray propagation code
\textsc{Picard}. Assuming non-axisymmetric cosmic ray source distributions
yields new insights on the behaviour of primary versus secondary nuclei.
  We find that primary cosmic rays are more strongly confined to the vicinity
of the sources, while the distribution of secondary cosmic rays is much more
homogeneous compared to the primaries. This leads to stronger spatial variation
in secondary to primary ratios when compared to axisymmetric source
distribution models. A good fit to the cosmic-ray data at Earth can be
accomplished in different spiral-arm models, although leading to decisively
different spatial distributions of the cosmic-ray flux. This results in very
different cosmic ray anisotropies, where even a good fit to the data becomes
possible. Consequently, we advocate directions to seek best fit propagation
parameters that take into account the higher complexity introduced by the
spiral-arm structure on the cosmic-ray distribution. We specifically
investigate whether the flux at Earth is representative for a large fraction of
the Galaxy. The variance among possible spiral-arm models allows us to quantify
the spatial variation of the cosmic-ray flux within the Galaxy in presence of
non-axisymmetric source distributions.

century many algorithms have been developed to solve the MCF problem and these
algorithms have varying worst-case bounds on their running time. However, these
worst-case bounds are not always a good indication of the algorithms'
performance in practice. The Network Simplex (NS) algorithm needs an
exponential number of iterations for some instances, but it is considered the
best algorithm in practice and performs best in experimental studies. On the
other hand, the Minimum-Mean Cycle Canceling (MMCC) algorithm is strongly
polynomial, but performs badly in experimental studies.
  To explain these differences in performance in practice we apply the
framework of smoothed analysis. We show an upper bound of
$O(mn^2\log(n)\log(\phi))$ for the number of iterations of the MMCC algorithm.
Here $n$ is the number of nodes, $m$ is the number of edges, and $\phi$ is a
parameter limiting the degree to which the edge costs are perturbed. We also
show a lower bound of $\Omega(m\log(\phi))$ for the number of iterations of the
MMCC algorithm, which can be strengthened to $\Omega(mn)$ when
$\phi=\Theta(n^2)$. For the number of iterations of the NS algorithm we show a

of active galactic nuclei (AGN). These variations are called microvariability
or intra-night variability, and this phenomenon has been monitored in samples
of blazars and unobscured AGNs. Detecting optical microvariations in targets
hidden by the obscuring torus is a challenging task because the region
responsible for the variations is hidden from our sight. However, there have
been reports of fast variations in obscured Seyfert galaxies in X-rays, which
rises the question whether microvariations can also be detected in obscured
AGNs in the optical regime. Because the expected variations are very small and
can easily be lost within the noise, the analysis requires a statistical
approach. We report the use of a one-way analysis of variance, ANOVA, with
which we searched for microvariability. ANOVA was successfully employed in
previous studies of unobscured AGNs. As a result, we found microvariable events
during three observing blocks: in two we observed the same object (Mrk 477),
and in another, J0759+5050. The results on Mrk 477 confirm previous findings.
However, since Mrk 477 is quite a peculiar target with hidden broad-line
regions, we cannot rule out the possibility that we have serendipitously chosen
a target prone to variations.

the severity of carsickness in lateral acceleration situations in automobiles.
Background: It is well known that the driver is generally less susceptible to
carsickness than are the passengers. However, it is also known that the driver
tilts his or her head toward the curve center when negotiating a curve, whereas
the passenger's head moves in the opposite direction. Therefore, we
hypothesized that the head-tilt strategy has the effect of reducing the
severity of carsickness. Method: A passenger car was driven on a quasi-oval
track with a pylon slalom while the participant sat in the navigator seat. The
experiment was terminated when either the participant felt the initial symptoms
of motion sickness or the car finished 20 laps. In the natural head-tilt
condition, the participants were instructed to sit naturally, to relax, and not
to oppose the lateral acceleration intentionally. In the active head-tilt
condition, the participants were asked to tilt their heads against the
centrifugal acceleration, thus imitating the driver's head tilt. Results: The
number of laps achieved in the active condition was significantly greater than
that in the natural condition. In addition, the subjective ratings of motion
sickness and symptoms in the active condition were significantly lower than
those in the natural condition. Conclusion: We suggest that an active head tilt
against centrifugal acceleration reduces the severity of motion sickness.
Application: Potential applications of this study include development of a
methodology to reduce carsickness.

thickness allows for a fine tuning of the splitting energy. The effect is
explained by a strong sensitivity of the hole wave function to the morphology
of the structure and a mutual compensation of the electron and hole
anisotropies. The oscillator strength of the excitonic transitions in the
studied quantum dots is comparable to those with a type-I confinement which
makes the dots attractive for quantum communication technology as emitters of
polarization-entangled photon pairs.

then compute superalgebras of Lie point symmetries of the bosonic and fermionic

reduction induces an insulator-to-metal transition in the high-temperature

analysis constraints on the enclosed mass are tightest, and are much better
than the constraints at previously suggested radii (e.g. 300~pc). For Carina,
Fornax, Leo~I, Sculptor, and Sextans the enclosed DM mass is $0.94 \pm 0.20$

constraints at smaller (and also unique for each galaxy) radii. The largest
central DM density constraint is for Sculptor: $\rho_0\gtrsim

logarithmic slope is totally unconstrained by the Jeans analysis at all the

dimensions of such integrated devices, the coupling of a NEMS to optical fields
becomes challenging. Despite recent progress in nano-optomechanical coupling,
active control of optical fields at the nanoscale has not been achieved with an
on-chip NEMS thus far. Here, we show a new type of hybrid system, which
consists of an on-chip graphene NEMS suspended a few tens of nanometers above
nitrogen-vacancy centres (NVC), which are stable single photon emitters
embedded in nano-diamonds. Electromechanical control of the photons emitted by
the NVC is provided by electrostatic tuning of the graphene NEMS position,
which is transduced to a modulation of NVC emission intensity. The
optomechanical coupling between the graphene displacement and the NVC emission
is based on near-field dipole-dipole interaction. This class of optomechanical
coupling increases strongly for smaller distances, making it suitable for
devices with nanoscale dimensions. These achievements hold promise for the
selective control of single-emitter arrays on chip, optical spectroscopy of
individual nano-objects, integrated optomechanical information processing and
quantum optomechanics.

thought that a large portion of H2 forms by association of hydrogen atoms to
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We model the influence of PAHs on
total H2 formation rates in photodissociation regions (PDRs) and assess the
effect of these formation rates on the total cloud structure. We set up a
chemical kinetic model at steady state in a PDR environment and included
adiative transfer to calculate the chemistry at different depths in the PDR.
This model includes known dust grain chemistry for the formation of H2 and a H2
formation mechanism on PAHs. Since H2 formation on PAHs is impeded by thermal
barriers, this pathway is only efficient at higher temperatures (T > 200 K). At
these temperatures the conventional route of H2 formation via H atoms
physisorbed on dust grains is no longer feasible, so the PAH mechanism enlarges
the region where H2 formation is possible. We find that PAHs have a significant
influence on the structure of PDRs. The extinction at which the transition from
atomic to molecular hydrogen occurs strongly depends on the presence of PAHs,
especially for PDRs with a strong external radiation field. A sharp spatial
transition between fully dehydrogenated PAHs on the outside of the cloud and
normally hydrogenated PAHs on the inside is found. As a proof of concept, we
use coronene to show that H2 forms very efficiently on PAHs, and that this
process can reproduce the high H2 formation rates derived in several PDRs.

electron is described by an over-extremal Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole (BH)
solution which has the naked singular ring and two-sheeted topology. This space
is regulated by the formation of a regular source based on the Higgs mechanism
of broken symmetry. This source shares much in common with the known MIT- and
SLAC-bag models, but has the important advantage, of being in accordance with
gravitational and electromagnetic field of the external KN solution. The KN bag
model is flexible. At rotations, it takes the shape of a thin disk, and similar
to other bag models, under deformations it creates a string-like structure
which is positioned along the sharp border of the disk.

analytically for the offset exponential and normal distributions in
three-dimensional space both for a finite sample and for limiting cases. It was
shown that the spherical projection of the sample mean of the shifted
exponential distribution has connections with modified Bessel functions and
with hypergeometric functions. It was shown explicitly how the distribution of
the sample mean of the exponential pdf converges near the mode to the normal
distribution. Approximation formulae for the distribution of the sample mean of
the shifted exponential distribution and for its directional precision and for
the precision of the estimation of the direction of shift of the normal
distribution were obtained.

thin films were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition at high and low
temperatures resulting in crystalline single-phase normal, inverse, as well as
disordered spinel oxide thin films with smooth surface morphology. The
dielectric function, determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry in a wide
spectral range from 0.5 eV to 8.5 eV, is compared with the magneto-optical
response of the dielectric tensor, investigated by magneto-optical Kerr effect
(MOKE) spectroscopy in the spectral range from 1.7 eV to 5.5 eV with an applied
magnetic field of 1.7 T. Crystal field, inter-valence and inter-sublattice
charge transfer transitions, and transitions from O$_{2p}$ to metal cation 3d
or 4s bands are identified in both the principal diagonal elements and the
magneto-optically active off-diagonal elements of the dielectric tensor.
Depending on the degree of cation disorder, resulting in local symmetry
distortion, the magneto-optical response is found to be strongest for high
crystal quality inverse spinels and for disordered normal spinel structure,
contrary to the first principle studies of CoFe$_2$O$_4$ and ZnFe$_2$O$_4$. The
results presented provide a basis for deeper understanding of light-matter
interaction in this material system that is of vital importance for
device-related phenomena and engineering.

are evolutionarily successful in a single game. More recently, a number of
contributions have studied the evolution of preferences instead: which
subjective conceptualizations of a game's payoffs give rise to evolutionarily
successful behavior in a single game. Here, we want to extend this existing
approach even further by asking: which general patterns of subjective
conceptualizations of payoff functions are evolutionarily successful across a
class of games. In other words, we will look at evolutionary competition of
payoff transformations in ""meta-games"", obtained from averaging over payoffs of
single games. Focusing for a start on the class of 2x2 symmetric games, we show
that regret minimization can outperform payoff maximization if agents resort to
a security strategy in case of radical uncertainty.
