\delta)$ differentially private algorithms for releasing approximate answers to
threshold functions. A threshold function $c_x$ over a totally ordered domain
$X$ evaluates to $c_x(y) = 1$ if $y \le x$, and evaluates to $0$ otherwise. We
give the first nontrivial lower bound for releasing thresholds with
$(\epsilon,\delta)$ differential privacy, showing that the task is impossible
over an infinite domain $X$, and moreover requires sample complexity $n \ge
\Omega(\log^*|X|)$, which grows with the size of the domain. Inspired by the
techniques used to prove this lower bound, we give an algorithm for releasing
thresholds with $n \le 2^{(1+ o(1))\log^*|X|}$ samples. This improves the
previous best upper bound of $8^{(1 + o(1))\log^*|X|}$ (Beimel et al., RANDOM
'13).
  Our sample complexity upper and lower bounds also apply to the tasks of
learning distributions with respect to Kolmogorov distance and of properly PAC
learning thresholds with differential privacy. The lower bound gives the first
separation between the sample complexity of properly learning a concept class
with $(\epsilon,\delta)$ differential privacy and learning without privacy. For
properly learning thresholds in $\ell$ dimensions, this lower bound extends to
$n \ge \Omega(\ell \cdot \log^*|X|)$.
  To obtain our results, we give reductions in both directions from releasing
and properly learning thresholds and the simpler interior point problem. Given
a database $D$ of elements from $X$, the interior point problem asks for an
element between the smallest and largest elements in $D$. We introduce new
recursive constructions for bounding the sample complexity of the interior
point problem, as well as further reductions and techniques for proving
impossibility results for other basic problems in differential privacy.

analyzed in a bounded domain with no-flux boundary conditions. The variables
are the species' density and an influence function which modifies the
information state of the individuals. The cross-diffusion term may stabilize or
destabilize the system. Furthermore, it allows for a formal gradient-flow or
entropy structure. Exploiting this structure, the global-in-time existence of
weak solutions and the exponential decay to the constant steady state is proved
in certain parameter regimes. This approach does not extend to all parameters.
We investigate local bifurcations from homogeneous steady states analytically
to determine whether this defines the validity boundary. This analysis shows
that generically there is a gap in the parameter regime between the entropy
approach validity and the first local bifurcation. Next, we use numerical
continuation methods to track the bifurcating non-homogeneous steady states
globally and to determine non-trivial stationary solutions related to herding
behaviour. In summary, we find that the main boundaries in the parameter regime
are given by the first local bifurcation point, the degeneracy of the diffusion
matrix and a certain entropy decay validity condition. We study several
parameter limits analytically as well as numerically, with a focus on the role
of changing a linear damping parameter as well as a parameter controlling the
cross-diffusion. We suggest that our paradigm of comparing
bifurcation-generated obstructions to the parameter validity of
global-functional methods could also be of relevance for many other models
beyond the one studied here.

masses are an important physical property for these studies, and yet the vast
majority of Kepler planet candidates do not have theirs measured. A key concern
is therefore how to map the measured radii to mass estimates in this
Earth-to-Neptune size range where there are no Solar System analogs. Previous
works have derived deterministic, one-to-one relationships between radius and
mass. However, if these planets span a range of compositions as expected, then
an intrinsic scatter about this relationship must exist in the population. Here
we present the first probabilistic mass-radius relationship (M-R relation)
evaluated within a Bayesian framework, which both quantifies this intrinsic
dispersion and the uncertainties on the M-R relation parameters. We analyze how
the results depend on the radius range of the sample, and on how the masses
were measured. Assuming that the M-R relation can be described as a power law
with a dispersion that is constant and normally distributed, we find that
$M/M_\oplus=2.7(R/R_\oplus)^{1.3}$, a scatter in mass of $1.9\ M_\oplus$, and a
mass constraint to physically plausible densities, is the ""best-fit""
probabilistic M-R relation for the sample of RV-measured transiting
sub-Neptunes ($R_{pl}<4\ R_\oplus$). More broadly, this work provides a
framework for further analyses of the M-R relation and its probable
dependencies on period and stellar properties.

amplitude. The slope $\beta$ gives the mean $HK$ color temperature $T_{var}$ of
the varying component. Because $T_{var}$ is hotter than the dust sublimation
temperature, we have tentatively assigned it to stellar variations. If the
gradient does not meet the origin of the flux-flux diagram, an additional non-
or less-varying component may be required. If the variability amplitude is
larger at the shorter wavelength, e.g. $\alpha < 0$, this component is cooler
than the star (e.g. a circumstellar disk); vice versa, if $\alpha > 0$, the
component is hotter like a scattering halo or even a companion star. We here
present examples of two YSOs, where the $HK$ FVG implies the presence of a
circumstellar disk; this finding is consistent with additional data at $J$ and
$L$. One YSO shows a clear $K$-band excess in the $JHK$ color-color diagram,
while the significance of a $K$-excess in the other YSO depends on the
measurement epoch. Disentangling the contributions of star and disk it turns
out that the two YSOs have huge variability amplitudes ($\sim 3-5$\,mag). The
$HK$ FVG analysis is a powerful complementary tool to analyze the varying
components of YSOs and worth further exploration of monitoring data at other
wavelengths.

lower Hubbard bands. The self-consistency is carried out on the Matsubara axis.

which the induced metric is held fixed -- have been used to model AdS
spacetimes with a finite cutoff. In the context of gauge/gravity duality, such
models are often described as dual to some novel UV-cufoff version of a
corresponding CFT that maintains local Lorentz invariance. We study linearized
gravity in the presence of such a wall and find it to differ significantly from
the seemingly-analogous case of Dirichlet boundary conditions for fields of
spins zero and one. In particular, using the Kodama-Ishibashi formalism, the
boundary condition that must be imposed on scalar-sector master field with
harmonic time dependence depends explicitly on their frequency. That this
feature first arises for spin-2 appears to be related to the second-order
nature of the equations of motion. It gives rise to a number of novel
instabilities, though both global and planar Anti-de Sitter remain (linearly)
stable in the presence of large-radius Dirichlet cutoffs. The instabilities
arise on the outside of spherical Dirichlet walls, and also inside sufficiently
large such spherical walls in de Sitter space. We analyze both inside and

phase, since the chiral condensate is Z_3 invariant. Consequently, the
perfectly confined phase is divided into the perfectly confined phase without
chiral symmetry restoration in a region of mu \lsim 300 MeV and T \lsim 200 MeV
and the perfectly confined phase with chiral symmetry restoration in a region
of \mu \gsim 300 MeV and 100 \lsim T \lsim 200 MeV. The basic phase structure
of Z_3-symmetric QCD-like theory remains in QCD. We show that in the perfectly
confined phase the sign problem becomes less serious because of \varphi=0,
using the heavy quark theory. We discuss a lattice QCD framework to evaluate
observables at \theta=0 from those at \theta=2\pi/3.

in stellar atmospheres. For the low-lying states of Mg i, electron collision
data were calculated using the R-matrix method. Calculations for collisional
broadening by neutral hydrogen were also performed where data were missing.
These calculations, together with data from the literature, were used to build
a model atom. First, the modelling was tested by comparisons with observed
spectra of benchmark stars with well-known parameters. Second, the spectral
line behaviour and uncertainties were explored by extensive experiments in
which sets of collisional data were changed or removed. The modelled spectra
agree well with observed spectra. The line-to-line scatter in the derived
abundances shows improvements compared to LTE. The observed Mg emission
features at 7 and 12 microns in the spectra of the Sun and Arcturus are
reasonably well reproduced. The modelling predicts non-LTE abundance
corrections in dwarfs, both solar metallicity and metal-poor, to be very small
(of order 0.01 dex), even smaller than found in previous studies. In giants,
corrections vary greatly between lines, but can be as large as 0.4 dex. Our
results emphasise the need for accurate data of Mg collisions with both
electrons and H atoms for precise non-LTE predictions of stellar spectra, but

inconsistent application of boundary data in the refined grids. Our scheme also
addresses the problem of spurious reflections that are generated when
propagating waves cross mesh refinement boundaries. We introduce a transition

important missions for hadron colliders. As a landmark of BSM physics, the MSSM
Higgs sector at the LHC is expected to be tested up to the scale of the
decoupling limit of O(1) TeV, except for a wedge region centered around
$\tan\beta \sim 3 -10$, which has been known to be difficult to probe. In this
article, we present a dedicated study testing the decoupled MSSM Higgs sector,
at the LHC and a next-generation $pp$-collider, proposing to search in channels
with associated Higgs productions, with the neutral and charged Higgs further
decaying into $tt$ and $tb$, respectively. In the case of neutral Higgs we are
able to probe for the so far uncovered wedge region via $pp\to bb H/A \to
bbtt$. Additionally, we cover the the high $\tan\beta$ range with $pp\to bb H/A
\to bb\tau\tau$. The combination of these searches with channels dedicated to
the low $\tan\beta$ region, such as $pp\to H/A \to tt$ and $pp\to tt H/A \to
tttt$ potentially covers the full $\tan\beta$ range. The search for charged
Higgs has a slightly smaller sensitivity for the moderate $\tan\beta$ region,
but additionally probes for the higher and lower $\tan\beta$ regions with even
greater sensitivity, via $pp\to tb H^\pm \to tbtb$. While the LHC will be able
to probe the whole $\tan\beta$ range for Higgs masses of O(1) TeV by combining
these channels, we show that a future 100 TeV $pp$-collider has a potential to
push the sensitivity reach up to $\sim \mathcal O(10)$ TeV. In order to deal
with the novel kinematics of top quarks produced by heavy Higgs decays, the
multivariate Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) method is applied in our collider

unpredictable source. Previous to this work, the only known way to transform
unpredictability into a key that was $\eps$ indistinguishable from having
min-entropy was via pseudorandomness, for example by Goldreich-Levin (GL)
hardcore bits. This approach has the inherent limitation that from a source
with $k$ bits of unpredictability entropy one can derive a key of length (and
thus HILL entropy) at most $k-2\log(1/\epsilon)$ bits. In many settings, e.g.
when dealing with biometric data, such a $2\log(1/\epsilon)$ bit entropy loss
in not an option. Our main technical contribution is a theorem that states that
in the high entropy regime, unpredictability implies HILL entropy. The loss in
circuit size in this argument is exponential in the entropy gap $d$. To
overcome the above restriction, we investigate if it's possible to first
""condense"" unpredictability entropy and make the entropy gap small. We show
that any source with $k$ bits of unpredictability can be condensed into a
source of length $k$ with $k-3$ bits of unpredictability entropy. Our condenser
simply ""abuses"" the GL construction and derives a $k$ bit key from a source
with $k$ bits of unpredicatibily. The original GL theorem implies nothing when
extracting that many bits, but we show that in this regime, GL still behaves
like a ""condenser"" for unpredictability. This result comes with two caveats (1)
the loss in circuit size is exponential in $k$ and (2) we require that the
source we start with has \emph{no} HILL entropy (equivalently, one can
efficiently check if a guess is correct). We leave it as an intriguing open
problem to overcome these restrictions or to prove they're inherent.

opacity of matter in the supernova core. Their current implementation in many
simulation codes, however, is rather schematic and ignores not only
modifications for the correlated nuclear medium of the nascent neutron star,
but also free-space corrections from nucleon recoil, weak magnetism or strange
quarks, which can easily add up to changes of several 10% for neutrino energies
in the spectral peak. In the Garching supernova simulations with the
Prometheus-Vertex code, such sophistications have been included for a long time
except for the strange-quark contributions to the nucleon spin, which affect
neutral-current neutrino scattering. We demonstrate on the basis of a 20 M_sun
progenitor star that a moderate strangeness-dependent contribution of g_a^s =
-0.2 to the axial-vector coupling constant g_a = 1.26 can turn an unsuccessful
three-dimensional (3D) model into a successful explosion. Such a modification
is in the direction of current experimental results and reduces the
neutral-current scattering opacity of neutrons, which dominate in the medium
around and above the neutrinosphere. This leads to increased luminosities and
mean energies of all neutrino species and strengthens the neutrino-energy
deposition in the heating layer. Higher nonradial kinetic energy in the gain
layer signals enhanced buoyancy activity that enables the onset of the
explosion at ~300 ms after bounce, in contrast to the model with vanishing
strangeness contributions to neutrino-nucleon scattering. Our results

mass, but also the formation epoch, is a prominent, albeit subtle, feature of
the cold dark matter structure formation theory, and is known as assembly bias.
At low mass scales ($\sim 10^{12}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$), early-forming halos are
predicted to be more strongly clustered than the late-forming ones. In this
study we aim to robustly detect the signature of assembly bias observationally,
making use of formation time indicators of central galaxies in low mass halos
as a proxy for the halo formation history. Weak gravitational lensing is
employed to ensure our early- and late-forming halo samples have similar
masses, and are free of contamination of satellites from more massive halos.
For the two formation time indicators used (resolved star formation history and
current specific star formation rate), we do not find convincing evidence of
assembly bias. For a pair of early- and late-forming galaxy samples with mean
mass $M_{200c} \approx 9\times10^{11}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$, the relative bias is
$1.00\pm 0.12$. We attribute the lack of detection to the possibilities that
either the current measurements of these indicators are too noisy, or they do
not correlate well with the halo formation history. Alternative proxies for the
halo formation history that should perform better are suggested for future
studies.

the hot gas structure across the Bondi accretion radius of the central
supermassive black hole, a measurement possible in only a handful of systems
but complicated by the bright nucleus and jet emission. By stacking only short
frame-time observations to limit pileup, and after subtracting the nuclear PSF,
we analysed the X-ray gas properties within the Bondi radius at 0.12-0.22 kpc
(1.5-2.8 arcsec), depending on the black hole mass. Within 2 kpc radius, we
detect two significant temperature components, which are consistent with
constant values of 2 keV and 0.9 keV down to 0.15 kpc radius. No evidence was
found for the expected temperature increase within ~0.25 kpc due to the
influence of the SMBH. Within the Bondi radius, the density profile is
consistent with $\rho\propto r^{-1}$. The lack of a temperature increase inside
the Bondi radius suggests that the hot gas structure is not dictated by the
SMBH's potential and, together with the shallow density profile, shows that the
classical Bondi rate may not reflect the accretion rate onto the SMBH. If this
density profile extends in towards the SMBH, the mass accretion rate onto the
SMBH could be at least two orders of magnitude less than the Bondi rate, which
agrees with Faraday rotation measurements for M87. We discuss the evidence for
outflow from the hot gas and the cold gas disk and for cold feedback, where gas
cooling rapidly from the hot atmosphere could feed the cirumnuclear disk and
fuel the SMBH. At 0.2 kpc radius, the cooler X-ray temperature component
represents ~20% of the total X-ray gas mass and, by losing angular momentum to
the hot gas component, could provide a fuel source of cold clouds within the
Bondi radius.

Our analysis of the theoretical uncertainties is based on different
implementations of the perturbative series and on independent variations of the
renormalization scales for the mass and the strong coupling. Taking into
account the resulting set of series to estimate perturbative uncertainties is
crucial, since some ways to treat the perturbative expansion can exhibit
extraordinarily small scale dependence when the two scales are set equal. As an
additional refinement, we address the issue that double scale variation could
overestimate the perturbative uncertainties. We supplement the analysis with a
test that quantifies the convergence rate of each perturbative series by a
single number. We find that this convergence test allows to determine an
overall and average convergence rate that is characteristic for the series
expansions of each moment, and to discard those series for which the
convergence rate is significantly worse. We obtain mc(mc) = 1.288 +- 0.020 GeV

starting from cosmological initial conditions and ending when metals created in
the first supernovae are incorporated into a collapsing gas-cloud. This occurs
after a supernova blast-wave collides with a nearby mini-halo, inducing further
turbulence that efficiently mixes metals into the dense gas in the center of
the halo. The gas that first collapses has been enriched to a metallicity of Z
~ 2e-5 Zsun. Due to the extremely low metallicity, collapse proceeds similarly
to metal-free gas until dust cooling becomes efficient at high densities,
causing the cloud to fragment into a large number of low mass objects. This
external enrichment mechanism provides a plausible origin for the most
metal-poor stars observed, such as SMSS J031300.36-670839.3, that appear to
have formed out of gas enriched by a single supernova. This mechanism operates
on shorter timescales than the time for low-mass mini-halos (M < 5e5 Msun) to
recover their gas after experiencing a supernova. As such, metal-enriched stars
will likely form first via this channel if the conditions are right for it to
occur. We identify a number of other externally enriched halos that may form
stars in this manner. These halos have metallicities as high as 0.01 Zsun,
suggesting that some members of the first generation of metal-enriched stars
may be hiding in plain sight in current stellar surveys.

  An important technical tool that we use is a construction of nearly optimal
and linear lossless condensers which is a careful instantiation of the GUV
condenser (Guruswami, Umans, Vadhan, JACM 2009). Moreover, we design a
deterministic and non-adaptive $\ell_1/\ell_1$ compressed sensing scheme based
on general lossless condensers that is equipped with a fast reconstruction
algorithm running in time $k^{1+\alpha} (\log N)^{O(1)}$ (for the GUV-based
condenser) and is of independent interest. Our scheme significantly simplifies
and improves an earlier expander-based construction due to Berinde, Gilbert,
Indyk, Karloff, Strauss (Allerton 2008).
  Our methods use linear lossless condensers in a black box fashion; therefore,
any future improvement on explicit constructions of such condensers would
immediately translate to improved parameters in our framework (potentially
leading to $k (\log N)^{O(1)}$ reconstruction time with a reduced exponent in
the poly-logarithmic factor, and eliminating the extra parameter $\alpha$).
  Finally, by allowing the algorithm to use randomness, while still using
non-adaptive queries, the running time of the algorithm can be improved to
$\tilde{O}(k \log^3 N)$.

matter of debate. To study the history of gas loss in Ursa Minor, we conducted
the first three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of this object, assuming
that the gas loss was driven by galactic winds powered only by type II
supernovae (SNe II). The initial gas setup and supernova (SN) rates used in our
simulations are mainly constrained by the inferred star formation history and
the observed velocity dispersion of Ursa Minor. After 3 Gyr of evolution, we
found that the gas removal efficiency is higher when the SN rate is increased,
and also when the initial mean gas density is lowered. The derived mass-loss
rates are systematically higher in the central regions (<300 pc), even though
such a relationship has not been strictly linear in time and in terms of the
galactic radius. The filamentary structures induced by Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities and the concentric shells related to the acoustic waves driven by
SNe can account for the inferred mass losses from the simulations. Our results
suggest that SNe II are able to transfer most of the gas from the central
region outward to the galactic halo. However, other physical mechanisms must be
considered in order to completely remove the gas at larger radii.

formation that can help us answer long-standing questions regarding the origin
and formation of giant planets. Here, I present the main conclusions from a
comprehensive atmospheric retrieval survey of eight hot Jupiters with
detectable molecular absorption in their near-infrared transmission spectra. I
analyze the eight transmission spectra using the newly-developed,
self-consistent atmospheric retrieval framework, SCARLET. Unlike previous
methods, SCARLET combines the physical and chemical consistency of complex
atmospheric models with the statistical treatment of observational
uncertainties known from atmospheric retrieval techniques. I find that all
eight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below
0.9. The finding of C/O<0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b,
HAT-P-1b, and XO-1b. For HD189733b, WASP-17b, and WASP-43b, I find that the
published WFC3 transmission spectra favor C/O<0.9 at greater than 95%
confidence. I further show that the water abundances on all eight hot Jupiters
are consistent with solar composition. The relatively small depth of the
detected water absorption features is due to the presence of clouds, not due to
a low water abundance as previously suggested for HD209458b. The presence of a
thick cloud deck is inferred for HD209458b and WASP-12b. HD189733b may host a
similar cloud deck, rather than the previously suggested Rayleigh hazes, if
star spots affect the observed spectrum. The approach taken in SCARLET can be
regarded as a new pathway to interpreting spectral observations of planetary
atmospheres. In this work, including our prior knowledge of H-C-N-O chemistry
enables me to constrain the C/O ratio without detecting a single carbon-bearing
molecule.

Estimates of rate coefficients for H and H$_2$ colliders were obtained from the
HF-He collisional data with a reduced-potential scaling approach. The
calculation of state-to-state rotational quenching cross sections for HF due to
He with initial rotational levels up to $j=20$ were performed for kinetic
energies from 10$^{-5}$ to 15000 cm$^{-1}$. State-to-state rate coefficients

reveals significant differences. In estimating HF-H$_2$ rate coefficients, the
reduced-potential method is found to be more reliable than the standard

differences between previously reported and our results to differences in the

collapse. Past holographic screens exist in our own universe; they obey an
analogous area law. Both exist more broadly than event horizons or dynamical
horizons. Working within classical General Relativity, we assume the null
curvature condition and certain generiticity conditions. We establish several
nontrivial intermediate results. If a surface $\sigma$ divides a Cauchy surface
into two disjoint regions, then a null hypersurface $N$ that contains $\sigma$
splits the entire spacetime into two disjoint portions: the
future-and-interior, $K^+$; and the past-and-exterior, $K^-$. If a family of
surfaces $\sigma(r)$ foliate a hypersurface, while flowing everywhere to the
past or exterior, then the future-and-interior $K^+(r)$ grows monotonically
under inclusion. If the surfaces $\sigma(r)$ are marginally trapped, we prove
that the evolution must be everywhere to the past or exterior, and the area
theorem follows. A thermodynamic interpretation as a Second Law is suggested by
the Bousso bound, which relates $A(r)$ to the entropy on the null slices $N(r)$

changes when an edge is added to or removed from the graph. There are known
examples of graphs where, perhaps counterintuitively, adding an edge can
decrease the spectral gap, a phenomenon that is analogous to Braess's paradox
in traffic networks. We show that this is often the case in random graphs in a
strong sense. More precisely, we show that for typical instances of
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G(n,p)$ with constant edge density $p \in
(0,1)$, the addition of a random edge will decrease the spectral gap with
positive probability, strictly bounded away from zero. To do this, we prove a
new delocalization result for eigenvectors of the Laplacian of $G(n,p)$, which
might be of independent interest.

for measuring Standard Model processes and for searching for new physics. The
performance of algorithms developed to select $b$- and $c$-quark jets is
measured using data recorded by LHCb from proton-proton collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV in 2011 and at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV in 2012. The efficiency for
identifying a $b(c)$ jet is about 65%(25%) with a probability for
misidentifying a light-parton jet of 0.3% for jets with transverse momentum
$p_{\rm T} > 20$ GeV and pseudorapidity $2.2 < \eta < 4.2$. The dependence of
the performance on the $p_{\rm T}$ and $\eta$ of the jet is also measured.

symmetric powers of the standard representation of $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(n))$,
since this category can be identified with
$\operatorname{Rep}(\mathfrak{gl}(0|n))$. The relations on our foams are
non-local, since the number of dots that can appear on a facet depends on the
position of the dot in the foam, rather than just on its colouring. This may be
related to Gilmore's non-local relations in Heegaard Floer knot homology.

necessarily analytic with non-negative Taylor coefficients. Despite the great
deal of interest generated by this theorem, a characterization of functions
preserving positivity for matrices of fixed dimension is not known.
  In this paper, we provide a complete description of polynomials of degree $N$
that preserve positivity when applied entrywise to matrices of dimension $N$.
This is the key step for us then to obtain negative lower bounds on the
coefficients of analytic functions so that these functions preserve positivity
in a prescribed dimension. The proof of the main technical inequality is
representation theoretic, and employs the theory of Schur polynomials.
Interpreted in the context of linear pencils of matrices, our main results
provide a closed-form expression for the lowest critical value, revealing at
the same time an unexpected spectral discontinuity phenomenon.
  Tight linear matrix inequalities for Hadamard powers of matrices and a sharp
asymptotic bound for the matrix-cube problem involving Hadamard powers are
obtained as applications. Positivity preservers are also naturally interpreted
as solutions of a variational inequality involving generalized Rayleigh
quotients. This optimization approach leads to a novel description of the
simultaneous kernels of Hadamard powers, and a family of stratifications of the
cone of positive semidefinite matrices.

classifier. The literature on AdaBoost focuses on classifier margins and
boosting's interpretation as the optimization of an exponential likelihood
function. These existing explanations, however, have been pointed out to be
incomplete. A random forest is another popular ensemble method for which there
is substantially less explanation in the literature. We introduce a novel
perspective on AdaBoost and random forests that proposes that the two
algorithms work for similar reasons. While both classifiers achieve similar
predictive accuracy, random forests cannot be conceived as a direct
optimization procedure. Rather, random forests is a self-averaging,
interpolating algorithm which creates what we denote as a ""spikey-smooth""
classifier, and we view AdaBoost in the same light. We conjecture that both
AdaBoost and random forests succeed because of this mechanism. We provide a
number of examples and some theoretical justification to support this
explanation. In the process, we question the conventional wisdom that suggests
that boosting algorithms for classification require regularization or early
stopping and should be limited to low complexity classes of learners, such as
decision stumps. We conclude that boosting should be used like random forests:
with large decision trees and without direct regularization or early stopping.

The measured magnetic field maps of the Low Energy Beam Transport solenoids are
being used for matching various beam configurations of the ion source to the
RFQ by computer simulations. The installation of the low energy diagnostics box
was completed in Q1 of 2015. The production of the RFQ cavity was started with
aluminum 7075-T6 which will be subsequently coated by Copper to reduce the RF
(Ohmic) losses. On the RF side, the development of the hybrid power supply
based on solid state and tetrode amplifiers continues. All RF transmission
components have already produced with the exception of the circulator and the
power coupling antenna which are in the manufacturing and design phases,
respectively. The acceptance tests of the produced RF components are ongoing.
This work summarizes the design, production and test phases of the
above-mentioned SPP proton beamline components.

knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia). Modeling topical coherence is crucial for
this task based on the assumption that information from the same semantic
context tends to belong to the same topic. This paper presents a novel deep
semantic relatedness model (DSRM) based on deep neural networks (DNN) and
semantic knowledge graphs (KGs) to measure entity semantic relatedness for
topical coherence modeling. The DSRM is directly trained on large-scale KGs and
it maps heterogeneous types of knowledge of an entity from KGs to numerical
feature vectors in a latent space such that the distance between two
semantically-related entities is minimized. Compared with the state-of-the-art
relatedness approach proposed by (Milne and Witten, 2008a), the DSRM obtains
19.4% and 24.5% reductions in entity disambiguation errors on two publicly

language fixes one evaluation order as the default, making it transparent to
program in that evaluation order, and troublesome to program in the other.
  This paper develops a type system that is impartial with respect to
evaluation order. Evaluation order is implicit in terms, and explicit in types,
with by-value and by-name versions of type connectives. A form of intersection
type quantifies over evaluation orders, describing code that is agnostic over
(that is, polymorphic in) evaluation order. By allowing such generic code,
programs can express the by-value and by-name versions of a computation without
code duplication.
  We also formulate a type system that only has by-value connectives, plus a
type that generalizes the difference between by-value and by-name connectives:
it is either a suspension (by name) or a ""no-op"" (by value). We show a
straightforward encoding of the impartial type system into the more economical
one. Then we define an elaboration from the economical language to a
call-by-value semantics, and prove that elaborating a well-typed source
program, where evaluation order is implicit, produces a well-typed target
program where evaluation order is explicit. We also prove a simulation between
evaluation of the target program and reductions (either by-value or by-name) in
the source program.
  Finally, we prove that typing, elaboration, and evaluation are faithful to
the type annotations given in the source program: if the programmer only writes
by-value types, no by-name reductions can occur at run time.

between vertices is considered. We develop efficient algorithms for two natural
classes of curves. In particular, given two polygonal curves of $n$ vertices
each, a $\eps$-approximation of their discrete Fr\'echet distance can be
computed in roughly $O(n\kappa^3\log n/\eps^3)$ time in three dimensions, if
one of the curves is \emph{$\kappa$-bounded}. Previously, only a
$\kappa$-approximation algorithm was known. If both curves are the so-called
\emph{\backbone~curves}, which are widely used to model protein backbones in
molecular biology, we can $\eps$-approximate their Fr\'echet distance in near
linear time in two dimensions, and in roughly $O(n^{4/3}\log nm)$ time in three
dimensions. In the second part, we propose a pseudo--output-sensitive algorithm
for computing Fr\'echet distance exactly. The complexity of the algorithm is a
function of a quantity we call the \emph{\bwnumber{}}, which is quadratic in
the worst case, but tends to be much smaller in practice.

Earlier work has suggested the promise of using the CIII] doublet for redshift

The primary challenge of this approach is the feasibility of locating CIII]

preliminary measurements from two other CLASH/HFF clusters in which, similarly,
no line was detected, but these were observed to lesser depth. Using the known
distribution of OH emission and the photometric redshift likelihood
distribution of each lensed candidate, we present statistical upper limits on
the mean total CIII] rest-frame equivalent width for our $z\simeq7-8$ sample.
For a signal/noise ratio of 5, we estimate the typical CIII] doublet rest-frame
equivalent width is, with 95\% confidence, $<26\pm5$ {\AA}. Although consistent
with the strength of earlier detections in brighter objects at $z\simeq6-7$,
our study illustrates the necessity of studying more luminous or

case that the only affordable operation is matrix-vector multiplication. In
such case, randomized method is a powerful way to estimate the spectral density
(or density of states) of $A$. However, randomized methods developed so far for
estimating spectral densities only extract information from different random
vectors independently, and the accuracy is therefore inherently limited to
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N_{v}})$ where $N_{v}$ is the number of random vectors. In
this paper we demonstrate that the ""$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N_{v}})$ barrier"" can
be overcome by taking advantage of the correlated information of random vectors
when properly filtered by polynomials of $A$. Our method uses the fact that the
estimation of the spectral density essentially requires the computation of the
trace of a series of matrix functions that are numerically low rank. By
repeatedly applying $A$ to the same set of random vectors and taking different
linear combination of the results, we can sweep through the entire spectrum of
$A$ by building such low rank decomposition at different parts of the spectrum.
Under some assumptions, we demonstrate that a robust and efficient
implementation of such spectrum sweeping method can compute the spectral
density accurately with $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ computational cost and
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory cost. Numerical results indicate that the new method
can significantly outperform existing randomized methods in terms of accuracy.
As an application, we demonstrate a way to accurately compute a trace of a
smooth matrix function, by carefully balancing the smoothness of the integrand
and the regularized density of states using a deconvolution procedure.

applicable over a wide energy range. For weakly absorbing features, the optimal
photon energy is 2.5 keV, from the point of view of image contrast and accuracy
of phase retrieval. On the other hand, in the case of strong absorption
objects, a higher photon energy is preferred to reduce the error of phase
retrieval. Those results can be used as guidelines to perform quantitative

globular clusters using radial velocities from the RAdial Velocity Experiment
Data Release 4 (RAVE-DR4) survey database. Our identifications are based on
three globular clusters -- NGC 3201, NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen) and NGC 362 -- all
of which are shown to have |RV|>100 km/s. The identification of globular
cluster stars in RAVE DR4 data offers a unique opportunity to test the
precision and accuracy of the stellar parameters determined with the currently
available Stellar Parameter Pipelines (SPPs) used in the survey, as globular
clusters are ideal testbeds for the validation of stellar atmospheric
parameters, abundances, distances and ages. For both NGC 3201 and $\omega$ Cen,
there is compelling evidence for numerous members (> 10) in the RAVE database;
in the case of NGC 362 the evidence is more ambiguous, and there may be
significant foreground and/or background contamination in our
kinematically-selected sample. A comparison of the RAVE-derived stellar
parameters and abundances with published values for each cluster and with BASTI
isochrones for ages and metallicities from the literature reveals overall good
agreement, with the exception of the apparent underestimation of surface
gravities for giants, in particular for the most metal-poor stars. Moreover, if
the selected members are part of the main body of each cluster our results
would also suggest that the distances from Binney et al. 2013, where only
isochrones more metal-rich than -0.9 dex were used, are typically
underestimated by ~ 40% with respect to the published distances for the
clusters, while the distances from Zwitter et al. 2010 show stars ranging from
1 to ~ 6.5 kpc -- with indications of a trend toward higher distances at lower
metallicities -- for the three clusters analysed in this study.

consequence, the problem of factoring polynomials over finite fields in time
nearly linear in the degree is reduced to finding Euler-Poincare

worst case complexity of polynomial factorization over finite fields is reduced
to the average case complexity of a problem concerning Drinfeld modules. The

after dissociation leads to a dissociation and association kinetics that can
profoundly differ from predictions based on bulk reaction models. The cause of
this effect can be traced back to the non-Markovian character of the ligand's
rebinding time probability density function, reflecting the fact that, for a
certain time span, the ligand still 'remembers' the receptor it was bound to
previously. In this manuscript, we explore the consequences of the hypothesis
that initial binding and consecutive rebinding give rise to a bond lifetime
density that is non-Markovian as well. We study the combined effect of the two
non-Markovian waiting time probability densities and show that even for very
short times the decay of the fraction of occupied receptors deviates from an
exponential. For long times, dissociation is slower than an exponential and the
fate of the the steady-state bound receptor fraction critically depends on the
extent of the deviation, relative to the rebinding time density, from the
Markovian limit: The population of occupied receptors may either decay
completely or assume a non-vanishing value for small and strong deviations,
respectively. Furthermore, we point out the important role played by fractional
calculus and demonstrate that the short- and long-time dynamics of the occupied
receptors can be naturally expressed as well as easily obtained in terms of
fractional differential equations involving the Riemann-Liouville derivative.
Our analysis shows that cells may exploit receptor memory as mechanism to
dynamically widen the range of potential response-patterns to a given signal.

conservative vector, and one more physical constraint for the fluid velocity in
addition to the positivity of the rest-mass density and the pressure. The key
is to prove the convexity and other properties of the admissible state set and
discover a concave function with respect to the conservative vector replacing
the pressure which is an important ingredient to enforce the
positivity-preserving property for the non-relativistic case. Several one- and

software reuse principle that consists of duplicating source code within a
program or across different systems owned or maintained by the same entity.
There are several contradictory claims concerning the impact of cloning on
software stability and maintenance effort. Some papers state that cloning is
desired since it speeds up the development process and helps stakeholders meet
the tight schedule and deliver on time. Other papers argue that code clone
leads to code bloat and causes increase software maintenance costs due to
copied defects and dead code. In this paper, we are replicating a previous
study done on cloning by the original author. We are repeating his work using
the same methods and metrics but with different subjects and experimenters. The
paper we are addressing evaluates the impact of code cloning on code stability
using three different stability-measuring methods. Our team will apply the same
stability measurement techniques on a different software system developed in C
programming language to determine generalizability, assure that the results are
reliable, validate their outcomes, and to inspire new search by combining
previous findings from related studies.

  Treatment Regimes",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A treatment regime formalizes personalized medicine as a function from
individual patient characteristics to a recommended treatment. A high-quality
treatment regime can improve patient outcomes while reducing cost, resource
consumption, and treatment burden. Thus, there is tremendous interest in
estimating treatment regimes from observational and randomized studies.
However, the development of treatment regimes for application in clinical
practice requires the long-term, joint effort of statisticians and clinical
scientists. In this collaborative process, the statistician must integrate
clinical science into the statistical models underlying a treatment regime and
the clinician must scrutinize the estimated treatment regime for scientific
validity. To facilitate meaningful information exchange, it is important that
estimated treatment regimes be interpretable in a subject-matter context. We
propose a simple, yet flexible class of treatment regimes whose members are
representable as a short list of if-then statements. Regimes in this class are
immediately interpretable and are therefore an appealing choice for broad
application in practice. We derive a robust estimator of the optimal regime
within this class and demonstrate its finite sample performance using
simulation experiments. The proposed method is illustrated with data from two
clinical trials.

ability to amplify small physical quantities. However, the low postselection
efficiency to obtain a large weak value has been a big obstacle to its
application in practice, since it may waste resources, and reduce the
measurement precision. An improved protocol was proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett.
113, 030401 (2014)] to make the postselected weak measurement dramatically more
efficient by using entanglement. Such a protocol can increase the Fisher
information of the measurement to approximately saturate the well-known
Heisenberg limit. In this paper, we review the entanglement-assisted protocol
of postselected weak measurement in detail, and study its robustness against
technical noises. We focus on readout errors. Readout errors can greatly
degrade the performance of postselected weak measurement, especially when the
readout error probability is comparable to the postselection probability. We
show that entanglement can significantly reduce the two main detrimental
effects of readout errors: inaccuracy in the measurement result, and the loss
of Fisher information. We extend the protocol by introducing a majority vote
scheme to postselection to further compensate for readout errors. With a proper
threshold, almost no Fisher information will be lost. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of entanglement in protecting postselected weak measurement
against readout errors.

Spatial structure of the HI is quantified through power spectra of maps of the
column density, NHI. For our featured representative field, centered on the
North Ecliptic Pole, the scaling exponents in power-law representations of the
power spectra of NHI maps for low, intermediate, and high velocity gas

maps were also made corresponding to the narrow-line and broad-line components
in the LVC range; for the narrow-line map the exponent is -1.9 +/- 0.1,
reflecting more small scale structure in the cold neutral medium (CNM). There
is evidence that filamentary structure in the HI CNM is oriented parallel to
the Galactic magnetic field. The power spectrum analysis also offers insight
into the various contributions to uncertainty in the data. The effect of 21-cm

of transmit powers of all coexisting BANs. It is shown that a unique Nash

highly doped ruby crystal at microwave frequencies. The cylindrical geometry of
the crystal allows for the creation of a superradiant, or ""spin-mode"" doublet,
with spatial structure similar to that of microwave whispering gallery modes
(WGMs). This results in a strict criteria of selection rules regarding the
interaction of resonant WGMs and spin-modes; namely that only modes with the
same wavenumber and azimuthal phase may interact. What results is an avoided
level crossing between the two, in which both WGM doublet constituents are seen
to interact with the spin resonance. We demonstrate that a four harmonic
oscillator model is necessary to accurately describe this result.

  In January 2014, we measured the phase-dependent spectrum of AA Dor with

presumable synchronized with the orbital period, its surface strictly divides
into a day and night side. Therefore, we may obtain the spectrum of its cool
side during its transit and of its hot, irradiated side close to its
occultation. We developed the Virtual Observatory (VO) tool TLISA to search for
weak lines of a faint companion in a binary system.
  We identified 53 spectral lines of the secondary in the ultraviolet-blue,
visual, and near-infrared XSHOOTER spectra that are strongest close to its
occultation. We identified 57 (20 additional) lines in available UVES
(Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph) spectra from 2001. The lines are
mostly from C II-III and O II, typical for a low-mass star that is irradiated

cycle of a system of non-linear ODEs in a very narrow interval of the
bifurcation parameter. It occurs in slow-fast systems and is well understood in
singular perturbation problems where a small parameter epsilon defines the time
scale separation. We present an iterative algorithm for the determination of
the canard explosion point which can be applied for a general slow-fast system
without an explicit small parameter. We also present assumptions under which

minimization problem for Horn formulas in propositional logic. The hydra number
of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is the minimal number of hyperarcs of the form
$u,v\rightarrow w$ required in a directed hypergraph $H=(V,F)$, such that for
every pair $(u, v)$, the set of vertices reachable in $H$ from $\{u, v\}$ is
the entire vertex set $V$ if $(u, v) \in E$, and it is $\{u, v\}$ otherwise.
Here reachability is defined by forward chaining, a standard marking algorithm.
  Various bounds are given for the hydra number. We show that the hydra number
of a graph can be upper bounded by the number of edges plus the path cover
number of the line graph of a spanning subgraph, which is a sharp bound in
several cases. On the other hand, we construct single-headed graphs for which
that bound is off by a constant factor. Furthermore, we characterize trees with
low hydra number, and give a lower bound for the hydra number of trees based on
the number of vertices that are leaves in the tree obtained from $T$ by
deleting its leaves. This bound is sharp for some families of trees. We give
bounds for the hydra number of complete binary trees and also discuss a related
minimization problem.

problem of preparation of these type of states is very important in quantum
information theory. But the factor which prohibit the generation of the above
mentioned pure states shared between two and three distant partners is
decoherence. When we send one qubit, from a two qubit state, through
decoherence channel like amplitude damping channel, the purity of the qubit is
lost and it ends up with a mixed state. Therefore it is very difficult to keep
the pure maximally entangled state in a maximally entangled pure state or in an
entangled state with high entanglement. In this work we have provided a method
by which one can generate experimentally a maximally entangled Bell states
shared between distant parties with a non-zero probability when a qubit, from a
two qubit general state, passes through decoherence channel. Therefore, despite
of the fact that qubit is interacting with the noisy channel, we are able to
generate Bell state shared between two distant partners. Further, we have shown
that it is possible to generate pure three-qubit W-type states shared between
three distant partners using economical quantum cloning machine and
weak-measurement based feed-forward control scheme, even though the second and

to different entanglement orderings of the states. On the other hand, although
it is not an entanglement measure and not monotonic under local operations, due
to its ability of detecting multipartite entanglement, quantum Fisher

By use of Mean Field Theory, suitably generalized to deal with short range
effective interactions, the phase diagram of a binary mixture ofcolloidal
particles (modelled as hard spheres) in a solvent is determined as a function
of the polymer concentration on the basis of the Asakura-Oosawa model.The
topology of the phase diagram changes when the relative size of the colloidal
particles is reduced: the critical line connecting the liquid-vapour critical
points of the two pure fluids breaks and the branch starting from the critical
point of the bigger particles bends to higher volume fractions, where
concentration fluctuations drive the transition. The effects of a softer
colloid-polymer interaction is also investigated: Even the presence of a small
repulsive tail in the potential gives rise to a significant lowering of the
stability threshold. In this case, phase transitions may take place by adding
just a few percent of depletant in volume fraction. These results may be
relevant for the interpretation of recent experiments of solidification
kinetics in colloidal mixtures.

Method to discontinuous subgroups of the group of isometries of a direct
product of hyperbolic spaces. If the algebra $A$ has degree 2 then via the
Galois embeddings of the centre of the algebra $A$ one considers the group of
reduced norm one elements of the order $\O$ as such a group and thus one would
obtain a solution to the mentioned problem. This would provide presentations of
the unit group of orders in the simple components of degree 2 of $\mathbb{Q} G$

paper is to initiate this approach by executing this method on the Hilbert

integers in a real quadratic extension of the rationals. This group acts
discontinuously on a direct product of two hyperbolic spaces of dimension two.

pISTA converges to the minimum of a function with a balanced tight frame

better reconstruction than the widely used synthesis sparse model and the
accelerated pISTA converges faster or comparable to the state-of-art smoothing
FISTA. One major advantage of pISTA is that only one extra parameter, the step
size, is introduced and the numerical solution is stable to it in terms of
image reconstruction errors, thus allowing easily setting in many fast magnetic

and $\varepsilon (\cdot)$ is a ``slow'' control, i.e.,
$\int_{0}^{+\infty}\varepsilon\left(t\right)dt=+\infty$, then each trajectory
of the system converges weakly, as $t$ goes to $+\infty$, to the element of
minimal norm of the closed convex set $C.$ When $\Phi$ is a convex
differentiable function whose gradient is Lipschitz continuous,
  we show that the strong convergence property is satisfied. Then we examine
the effect of other types of regularizing methods.

nonnegative tensors by means of the nonnegativity of all entries and
$H$-eigenvalues. This generalization is defined for tensors of any order (even
or odd), while it reduces to the class of nonnegative positive semidefinite
tensors in the even order case. We show that many nonnegative structured
tensors, which are positive semidefinite in the even order case, are indeed
doubly nonnegative as well in the odd order case. As an important subclass of
doubly nonnegative tensors, the completely positive tensors are further
studied. By using dominance properties for completely positive tensors, we can
easily exclude some doubly nonnegative tensors, such as the signless Laplacian
tensor of a nonempty $m$-uniform hypergraph with $m\geq 3$, from the class of
completely positive tensors. Properties of the doubly nonnegative tensor cone
and the completely positive tensor cone are established. Their relation and
difference are discussed. These show us a different phenomenon comparing to the
matrix case. By employing the proposed properties, more subclasses of these two
types of tensors are identified. Particularly, all positive Cauchy tensors with
any order are shown to be completely positive. This gives an easily
constructible subclass of completely positive tensors, which is significant for
the study of completely positive tensor decomposition. A preprocessed Fan-Zhou
algorithm is proposed which can efficiently verify the complete positivity of
nonnegative symmetric tensors. We also give the solution analysis of tensor
complementarity problems with the strongly doubly nonnegative tensor structure.

into its equatorial plane. However, the recent suggestion that a ring system
might exist (or have existed) about Rhea, a moon whose shape includes a strong
prolate component pointed toward Saturn, raises the question of whether rings
around a triaxial primary can be stable. We study the role of prolateness in
the behavior of rings around Rhea and extend our results to similar problems
such as possible rings around exoplanets. Using a Hamiltonian approach, we
point out that the dynamical behavior of ring particles is governed by three
different time scales: the orbital period of the particles, the rotation period
of the primary, and the precession period of the particles' orbital plane. In
the case of Rhea, two of these are well separated from the third, allowing us
to average the Hamiltonian twice. To study the case of slow rotation of the
primary, we also carry out numerical simulations of a thin disk of particles
undergoing secular effects and damping. For Rhea, the averaging reduces the
Hamiltonian to an oblate potential, under which rings would be stable only in
the equatorial plane. This is not the case for Iapetus; rather, it is the lack
of a prolate component to its shape that allows Iapetus to host rings.
Plausible exoplanets should mostly be in the same regime as Rhea, though other
outcomes are possible. The numerical simulations indicate that, even when the
double averaging is irrelevant, rings settle in the equatorial plane on an
approximately constant time scale.

pronounced in the 'insulating' regions. While density and amplitude
correlations are short-ranged at strong disorder we show that current

They are observed in both classical and quantum systems, ranging from the

occupation of the energetic ground state in ultra-cold bosonic gases
(Bose-Einstein condensation). Recently, it has been shown that a driven and
dissipative system of bosons may form multiple condensates. Which states become
the condensates has, however, remained elusive thus far. The dynamics of this
condensation are described by coupled birth-death processes, which also occur
in evolutionary game theory. Here, we apply concepts from evolutionary game
theory to explain the formation of multiple condensates in such
driven-dissipative bosonic systems. We show that vanishing of relative entropy
production determines their selection. The condensation proceeds exponentially
fast, but the system never comes to rest. Instead, the occupation numbers of
condensates may oscillate, as we demonstrate for a rock-paper-scissors game of
condensates.

magnetic arms situated between the material arms. The nature of these magnetic
arms is a topic of active debate. Previously we found a hint that taking into
account the effects of injections of small-scale magnetic fields generated,
e.g., by turbulent dynamo action, into the large-scale galactic dynamo can
result in magnetic arm formation. We now investigate the joint roles of an
arm/interarm turbulent diffusivity contrast and injections of small-scale
magnetic field on the formation of large-scale magnetic field (""magnetic arms"")
in the interarm region. We use the relatively simple ""no-$z$"" model for the
galactic dynamo. This involves projection on to the galactic equatorial plane
of the azimuthal and radial magnetic field components; the field component
orthogonal to the galactic plane is estimated from the solenoidality condition.
We find that addition of diffusivity gradients to the effect of magnetic field
injections makes the magnetic arms much more pronounced. In particular, the
regular magnetic field component becomes larger in the interarm space compared
to that within the material arms.The joint action of the turbulent diffusivity
contrast and small-scale magnetic field injections (with the possible
participation of other effects previously suggested) appears to be a plausible
explanation for the phenomenon of magnetic arms.

the Galactic Central Parsec. This modified theory of gravity consists of a
superposition of the metric Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with an $f(R)$ term
constructed {\it \`{a} la Palatini} and can be easily reduced to an equivalent
scalar-tensor theory. Such an approach is introduced in order to cure the
shortcomings related to $f(R)$ gravity, in general formulated either in metric
or in metric-affine frameworks. Hybrid gravity allows to disentangle the
further gravitational degrees of freedom with respect to those of standard
General Relativity. The present analysis is based on the S2 star orbital
precession around the massive compact dark object at the Galactic Centre where
the simulated orbits in hybrid modified gravity are compared with astronomical
observations. These simulations result with constraints on the range of hybrid
gravity interaction parameter $\phi_0$, showing that in the case of S2 star it
is between -0.0009 and -0.0002. At the same time, we are also able to obtain
the constraints on the effective mass parameter $m_{\phi}$, and found that it
is between -0.0034 and -0.0025 AU$^{-1}$ for S2 star. Furthermore, the hybrid
gravity potential induces precession of S2 star orbit in the same direction as
General Relativity. In previous papers, we considered other types of extended
gravities, like metric power law $f(R)\propto R^n$ gravity, inducing Yukawa and
Sanders-like gravitational potentials, but it seems that hybrid gravity is the
best among these models to explain different gravitational phenomena at
different astronomical scales.

practical use. Consequently, tree decomposition based algorithms have limited
applicability to large scale optimization. However, by first reducing the input
graph so that a small width tree decomposition can be found, we can harness the
power of tree decomposi- tion based techniques in a heuristic algorithm, usable
on graphs of much larger treewidth than would be tractable to solve exactly. We
propose a solution merging heuristic to the Steiner Tree Problem that applies
this idea. Standard local search heuristics provide a natural way to generate
subgraphs with lower treewidth than the original instance, and subse- quently
we extract an improved solution by solving the instance induced by this
subgraph. As such the fixed parameter tractable algorithm be- comes an
efficient tool for our solution merging heuristic. For a large class of sparse
benchmark instances the algorithm is able to find small width tree
decompositions on the union of generated solutions. Subsequently it can often
improve on the generated solutions fast.

of the process with a minimum number of parameters. The reported dynamo
simulations extend into a ""buoyancy-dominated"" regime where the buoyancy
forcing is dominant while the Coriolis force is no longer balanced by pressure
gradients and strong anti-solar differential rotation develops as a result. We
find that the self-generated magnetic fields, despite being relatively weak,
are able to reverse the direction of differential rotation from anti-solar to
solar-like. We also find that convection flows in this regime are significantly
stronger in the polar regions than in the equatorial region, leading to
non-oscillatory dipole-dominated dynamo solutions, and to concentration of
magnetic field in the polar regions. We observe that convection has different
morphology in the inner and at the outer part of the convection zone
simultaneously such that organized geostrophic convection columns are hidden
below a near-surface layer of well-mixed highly-chaotic convection. While we
focus the attention on the buoyancy-dominated regime, we also demonstrate that
conical differential rotation profiles and persistent regular dynamo
oscillations can be obtained in the parameter space of the rotation-dominated
regime even within this minimal model.

The way concepts are organized
in the human brain may reflect distinct features of cultural, historical, and

cognition. Semantics, or meaning expressed through language, provides direct
access to the underlying conceptual structure, but meaning is notoriously
difficult to measure, let alone parameterize. Here we provide an empirical
measure of semantic proximity between concepts using cross-linguistic
dictionaries. Across languages carefully selected from a phylogenetically and
geographically stratified sample of genera, translations of words reveal cases
where a particular language uses a single polysemous word to express concepts
represented by distinct words in another. We use the frequency of polysemies
linking two concepts as a measure of their semantic proximity, and represent
the pattern of such linkages by a weighted network. This network is highly
uneven and fragmented: certain concepts are far more prone to polysemy than
others, and there emerge naturally interpretable clusters loosely connected to
each other. Statistical analysis shows such structural properties are
consistent across different language groups, largely independent of geography,
environment, and literacy. It is therefore possible to conclude the conceptual
structure connecting basic vocabulary studied is primarily due to universal
features of human cognition and language use.

scattering, is of the order $10^{-49}$~G on a coherence scale of 10 kpc. We
explicitly show that the magnetic fields generated from this process are
sustainable and are not erased by resistive diffusion. We compare the results
with current observations and discuss the implications. Our seed magnetic
fields are generated on small scales whereas the main mechanisms studied in the
literature are on scale bigger than 1 Mpc. However, compared to more exotic
theories generating seed magnetic fields on similar scales, the strength of our
fields are generally smaller.

trajectories. In many interesting cases these trajectories can be identified
with geodesic curves. We define here the entropy by $S = \ln \chi (x)$ with
$\chi(x)$ being the distance between two nearby geodesics. We derive an
equation for the entropy which by transformation to a Ricatti-type equation
becomes similar to the Jacobi equation. We further show that the geodesic
equation for a null geodesic in a double warped space time leads to the same
entropy equation. By applying a Robertson-Walker metric for a flat
three-dimensional Euclidian space expanding as a function of time, we again
reach the entropy equation stressing the connection between the chosen entropy
measure and time. We finally turn to the Raychaudhuri equation for expansion,
which also is a Ricatti equation similar to the transformed entropy equation.
Those Ricatti-type equations have solutions of the same form as the Jacobi
equation. The Raychaudhuri equation can be transformed to a harmonic oscillator
equation, and it has been shown that the geodesic deviation equation of Jacobi
is essentially equivalent to that of a harmonic oscillator. The Raychaudhuri
equations are strong geometrical tools in the study of General Relativity and
Cosmology. We suggest a refined entropy measure applicable in Cosmology and
defined by the average deviation of the geodesics in a congruence.

Jc$^{GB}$ can exceed Jc$^{grain}$ (r$^{GB}$>1) where the GB pinning is
optimized by the field being parallel to the GB dislocations. However, even in

high Jc channels between the GB dislocation cores are almost Ca-free. It may be
therefore that the positive effects of Ca doping seen by many authors near Tc

smart enumeration of all the non-dominated paths. Recent improvements of these
enumeration algorithms rely on the use of bounds on path resources to discard
partial solutions. The quality of the bounds determines the performance of the
algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a standard
procedure to generate bounds on paths resources in a general setting which
covers most resource constrained shortest path problems, among which stochastic
versions.
  In that purpose, we introduce a generalization of the resource constrained
shortest path problem where the resources are taken in a monoid. The resource
of a path is the monoid sum of the resources of its arcs. The problem consists
in finding a path whose resource minimizes a non-decreasing cost function of
the path resource among the paths that respect a given constraint. Enumeration
algorithms are generalized to this framework. We use lattice theory to provide
polynomial procedures to find good quality bounds. These procedures solve a
generalization of the algebraic path problem, where arc resources belong to a
lattice ordered monoid. The practical efficiency of the approach is proved
through an extensive numerical study on some deterministic and stochastic
resource constrained shortest path problems.

tubes. The assembly feature provides the fiber with rich interface structures
and thus various ways of energy dissipation, as reflected by the non-zero loss
tangent (>0.028--0.045) at low vibration frequencies. A fiber containing
entangled CNTs possesses higher loss tangents than a fiber spun from aligned
CNTs. Liquid densification and polymer infiltration, the two common ways to
increase the interfacial friction and thus the fiber's tensile strength and
modulus, are found to efficiently reduce the damping coefficient. This is
because the sliding tendency between CNT bundles can also be well suppressed by
the high packing density and the formation of covalent polymer cross-links
within the fiber. The CNT/bismaleimide composite fiber exhibited the smallest
loss tangent, nearly as the same as that of carbon fibers. At a higher level of
the assembly structure, namely a multi-ply CNT yarn, the inter-fiber friction
and sliding tendency obviously influence the yarn's damping performance, and
the loss tangent can be tuned within a wide range, as similar to carbon fibers,
nylon yarns, or cotton yarns. The wide-range tunable dynamic properties allow
new applications ranging from high quality factor materials to dissipative
systems.

in their organization and regulation. There are many different factors
affecting the location of nucleosomes. Some can be viewed as preferential
binding of a single nucleosome to different locations along the DNA and some as
interactions between neighboring nucleosomes. In this study we analyzed how
well nucleosomes are positioned along the DNA as a function of strength of the
preferential binding, correlation length of the binding energy landscape,
interactions between neighboring nucleosomes and others relevant system
properties. We analyze different scenarios: designed energy landscapes and
generically disordered ones and derive conditions for good positioning. Using
analytic and numerical approaches we find that, even if the binding preferences
are very weak, synergistic interplay between the interactions and the binding
preferences is essential for a good positioning of nucleosomes, especially on
correlated energy landscapes. Analyzing empirical energy landscape, we discuss
relevance of our theoretical results to positioning of nucleosomes on DNA

more theoretically complex or experimentally invasive ones such as cyclization,

described by a logotropic equation of state $P=A\ln(\rho/\rho_*)$, where $\rho$
is the rest-mass density, $\rho_*$ is a reference density, and $A$ is the
logotropic temperature. The energy density $\epsilon$ is the sum of two terms:
a rest-mass energy term $\rho c^2$ that mimics dark matter and an internal
energy term $u(\rho)=-P(\rho)-A$ that mimics dark energy. This decomposition
leads to a natural, and physical, unification of dark matter and dark energy,
and elucidates their mysterious nature. The logotropic model depends on a
single parameter $B=A/\rho_{\Lambda}c^2$ where $\rho_{\Lambda}$ is the
cosmological density. For $B=0$, we recover the $\Lambda$CDM model. Using
cosmological constraints, we find that $0\le B\le 0.09425$. We consider the
possibility that dark matter halos are described by the same logotropic
equation of state. When $B>0$, pressure gradients prevent gravitational
collapse and provide halo density cores instead of cuspy density profiles, in
agreement with the observations. The universal rotation curve of logotropic
dark matter halos is consistent with the observational Burkert profile up to

$\Sigma=\rho_0 r_h$ is constant. This result is in agreement with the

we obtain $A=2.13\times 10^{-9} \, {\rm g}\, {\rm m}^{-1}\, {\rm s}^{-2}$ that

fullfills the same observational constraints as the $\Lambda$CDM model.
However, it has a nonzero velocity of sound and a nonzero Jeans length which,
at the beginning of the matter era, is about $\lambda_J=40.4\, {\rm pc}$, in
agreement with the minimum size of the dark matter halos observed in the
universe. At the galactic scale, the logotropic pressure balances gravitational
attraction and solves the cusp problem and the missing satellite problem. The
logotropic equation of state generates a universal rotation curve that agrees
with the empirical Burkert profile of dark matter halos up to the halo radius.
In addition, it implies that all the dark matter halos have the same surface

dwarf galaxies enclosed within a sphere of fixed radius $r_{u}=300\, {\rm pc}$
