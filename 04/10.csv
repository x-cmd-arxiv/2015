basic SWIPT system with separated receivers. A multi-objective optimization
problem is formulated under the constraint of maximum transmit power. We
propose an algorithm which achieves flexible resource allocation for energy

region of the system design objectives is shown in simulation results. Further,
we consider secure communication in a SWIPT system with power splitting
receivers. Artificial noise is injected to the com- munication channel to
combat the eavesdropping capability of potential eavesdroppers. A
power-efficient resource allocation algorithm is developed when multiple
legitimate information receivers and multi-antenna potential eavesdroppers
co-exist in the system. Simulation results demonstrate a significant

is studied from the perspective of multi-layer flow network. A model of

of flows in flow systems. Then, flow distances are introduced, and symmetric
minimum flow distance is presented. Subsequently, we discuss the establishment
of the multi-layer flow networks of international trade from two coupled
viewpoints, i.e., the viewpoint of commodity flow and that of money flow. Thus,
the multi-layer flow networks of international trade is explored. First,
trading ""trophic levels"" are adopted to depict positions that economies
occupied in the flow network. We find that the distributions of trading
""trophic levels"" have the similar clustering pattern for different types of
commodity, and there are some regularities between money flow network and
commodity flow network. Second, we find that active and competitive countries
trade a wide spectrum of products, while inactive and underdeveloped countries
trade a limited variety of products. Besides, some abnormal countries import
many types of goods, which the vast majority of countries do not need to
import. It may indicate an abnormal economic status. Third, harmonic node
centrality is proposed and we find the phenomenon of centrality stratification.
It means that competitive countries tend to occupy the central positions in the
trading of a large variety of commodities, while underdeveloped countries
likely in the peripheral positions in the trading of their limited varieties of
products. Fourth, we find that manufactured products have significant larger
mean first-passage flow distances from the source to the sink than that of
primary products.

A number of observational predictions distinguish the model from Core
Accretion: (a) composition of the massive cores is always dominated by rocks
not ices; (b) the core mass function is smooth with no minimum at $\sim 3

optical polarization of electron spins in nitrogen-vacancy centers and the
transfer of this polarization to 13C nuclei by means of microwave control to
overcome the severe challenges that are posed by the random orientation of the
nanodiamonds and their nitrogen-vacancy centers. Specifically, these random
orientations result in exceedingly large energy variations of the electron spin
levels that render the polarization and coherent control of the
nitrogen-vacancy center electron spins as well as the control of their coherent
interaction with the surrounding 13C nuclear spins highly inefficient. We
address these challenges by a combination of an off-resonant microwave double
resonance scheme in conjunction with a realization of the integrated solid
effect which, together with adiabatic rotations of external magnetic fields or
rotations of nanodiamonds, leads to a protocol that achieves high levels of
hyperpolarization of the entire nuclear-spin bath in a randomly oriented
ensemble of nanodiamonds even at room temperature. This hyperpolarization
together with the long nuclear spin polarization lifetimes in nanodiamonds and
the relatively high density of 13C nuclei has the potential to result in a
major signal enhancement in 13C nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and suggests
functionalized and hyperpolarized nanodiamonds as a unique probe for molecular
imaging both in vitro and in vivo.

of a strictly convex optimization problem. We also analyze the maximum
throughput problem on such networks seeking to maximize the amount of flow that
can be delivered to the loads while satisfying bounds on the node potentials.
When the dissipation function is differentiable we develop a representation of
the maximum throughput problem in the form of a twice differentiable biconvex

needs to simulate cluster dynamics on such long timescales for which the
molecular dynamics approach becomes inefficient. We therefore propose a
two-step Molecular Dynamics-Hydrodynamic scheme. In the first step we use
molecular dynamics code to follow the dynamics of an irradiated cluster until
all the photo-excitation and corresponding relaxation processes are finished
and a nanoplasma, consisting of ground-state ions and thermalized electrons, is
formed. In the second step we perform long-timescale propagation of this

accounting for the impact ionization and three-body recombination processes at
this stage. We compare our results with the corresponding molecular dynamics

lower computational cost when compared to a molecular dynamics approach.
Finally, we comment on the accuracy and limitations of our present model and

interactions, which cannot be fully understood in isolation. These different
types of interactions are often represented as layers, attributes on the edges
or as a time-dependence of the network structure. Although they are crucial for
a more comprehensive scientific understanding, these representations offer
substantial challenges. Namely, it is an open problem how to precisely
characterize the large or mesoscale structure of network systems in relation to
these additional aspects. Furthermore, the direct incorporation of these
features invariably increases the effective dimension of the network
description, and hence aggravates the problem of overfitting, i.e. the use of
overly-complex characterizations that mistake purely random fluctuations for
actual structure. In this work, we propose a robust and principled method to
tackle these problems, by constructing generative models of modular network

well as a nonparametric Bayesian methodology to infer the parameters from data

  Stress",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Research within the field of multiscale modelling seeks, amongst other
questions, to reconcile atomistic scale interactions with thermodynamical
quantities (such as stress) on the continuum scale. The estimation of stress at
a continuum point on the atomistic scale requires a pre-defined kernel
function. This kernel function derives the stress at a continuum point by
averaging the contribution from atoms within a region surrounding the continuum
point. Commonly the kernel weight assignment is isotropic: an identical weight
is assigned to atoms at the same spatial distance, which is tantamount to a
local constant regression model. In this paper we employ a local linear
regression model and leverage the mechanism of automatic kernel carpentry to
allow for spatial averaging adaptive to the local distribution of atoms. As a
result, different weights may be assigned to atoms at the same spatial
distance. This is of interest for determining atomistic stress at stacking
faults, interfaces or surfaces. It is shown in this study that for crystalline
solids, although the local linear regression model performs elegantly, the
additional computational costs are not justified compared to the local constant
regression model.

the spatial variable and obtain a lattice dynamical system with a hysteretic
nonlinearity. We analyze a new mechanism that leads to appearance of a
spatio-temporal pattern called {\it rattling}: the solution exhibits a
propagation phenomenon different from the classical traveling wave, while the
hysteretic nonlinearity, loosely speaking, takes a different value at every
second spatial point, independently of the grid size. Such a dynamics indicates
how one should redefine hysteresis to make the continuous problem well-posed
and how the solution will then behave. In the present paper, we develop main
tools for the analysis of the spatially discrete model and apply them to a
prototype case. In particular, we prove that the propagation velocity is of
order $a t^{-1/2}$ as $t\to\infty$ and explicitly find the rate $a$.

crystal sample of Bi2Te3. We find that the magnetoresistance is highly
asymmetric in positive and negative magnetic fields for small angles between
the magnetic field and the direction perpendicular to the plane of the sample.
The magnetoresistance becomes symmetric as the angle approaches 90 degree. The
quantum Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations are symmetric and show signatures of
topological surface states with Dirac dispersion in the form of non-zero Berry
phase. However, the angular dependence of these oscillations suggests a complex
three dimensional Fermi surface as the source of these oscillations, which does
not exactly conform with the six ellipsoidal model of the Fermi surface of
Bi2Te3. We attribute the asymmetry in the magnetoresistance to a mixing of the
Hall voltage in the longitudinal resistance due to the comparable magnitude of
the Hall and longitudinal resistance in our samples. This provides a clue to
understanding the asymmetric magnetoresistance often seen in this and similar
materials. Moreover, the asymmetric nature evolves with exposure to atmosphere
and thermal cycling, which we believe is either due to exposure to atmosphere
or thermal cycling, or both affecting the carrier concentration and hence the
Hall signal in these samples. However, the quantum oscillations seem to be
robust against these factors which suggests that the two have different
origins.

Significant effects on low energy excitation spectra are found where the
Haldane gap ($\Delta_0 \approx 0.41J$; where $J$ is the intrachain exchange
interaction) is replaced by three energy minima at different antiferromagnetic
zone centers due to the complex interchain couplings. Further, the triplet
states are split into two branches by single-ion anisotropy. Quantitative
information on the intrachain and interchain interactions as well as on the
single-ion anisotropy are obtained from the analyses of the neutron scattering
spectra by the random phase approximation (RPA) method. The presence of
multiple competing interchain interactions is found from the analysis of the
experimental spectra and is also confirmed by the DFT calculations. The
interchain interactions are two orders of magnitude weaker than the
nearest-neighbour intrachain interaction $J$ = 8.7~meV. The DFT calculations
reveal that the dominant intrachain nearest-neighbor interaction occurs via

yields a unique bundle, up to isomorphism. Here we show that something stronger
is true: with an appropriate definition of isomorphism between generalized
holonomy maps, there is an equivalence of categories between the category whose
objects are generalized holonomy maps on a smooth, connected manifold and whose
arrows are holonomy isomorphisms, and the category whose objects are principal
connections on principal bundles over a smooth, connected manifold. This result
clarifies, and somewhat improves upon, the sense of ""unique recovery"" in
Barrett's theorems; it also makes precise a sense in which there is no loss of
structure involved in moving from a principal bundle formulation of Yang-Mills
theory to a holonomy, or ""loop"", formulation.

similar to those of the intermediate-luminosity SNe 2008in and 2009N. Its
plateau phase is unusually long, lasting for about 130 days after explosion.
The spectra are similar to those of the subluminous SN 2002gd, with moderate
expansion velocities. We estimate the $^{56}$Ni mass produced as $0.046 \pm
0.015\,{\rm M}_{\sun}$. We determine the distance to SN 2009ib using both the
expanding photosphere method (EPM) and the standard candle method. We also
apply EPM to SN 1986L, a type II-P SN that exploded in the same galaxy.
Combining the results of different methods, we conclude the distance to NGC
1559 as $D=19.8 \pm 3.0$ Mpc. We examine archival, pre-explosion images of the
field taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, and find a faint source at the
position of the SN, which has a yellow colour ($(V-I)_0 = 0.85$ mag). Assuming
it is a single star, we estimate its initial mass as $M_{\rm ZAMS}=20\,{\rm
M}_{\sun}$. We also examine the possibility, that instead of the yellow source
the progenitor of SN 2009ib is a red supergiant star too faint to be detected.
In this case we estimate the upper limit for the initial zero-age main sequence
mass of the progenitor to be $\sim 14-17\,{\rm M}_{\sun}$. In addition, we
infer the physical properties of the progenitor at the explosion via
hydrodynamical modelling of the observables, and estimate the total energy as
$\sim 0.55 \times 10^{51}$~erg, the pre-explosion radius as $\sim 400\,{\rm
R}_{\sun}$, and the ejected envelope mass as $\sim 15\,{\rm M}_{\sun}$, which
implies that the mass of the progenitor before explosion was $\sim
16.5-17\,{\rm M}_{\sun}$.

diagnostics at significant cosmological distances using a sample at z=0.8 drawn
from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. Oxygen and neon abundances are derived
from measurements of electron temperature and density. We directly compare
various commonly used relations between gas-phase metallicity and strong line
ratios of O, Ne, and H at z=0.8 and z=0. There is no evolution with redshift at
high precision ($\Delta \log{\mathrm{O/H}} = -0.01\pm0.03$, $\Delta
\log{\mathrm{Ne/O}} = 0.01 \pm 0.01$). O, Ne, and H line ratios follow the same
locus at z=0.8 as at z=0 with $\lesssim$0.02 dex evolution and low scatter
($\lesssim$0.04 dex). This suggests little or no evolution in physical
conditions of HII regions at fixed oxygen abundance, in contrast to models
which invoke more extreme properties at high redshifts. We speculate that
offsets observed in the [N II]/H$\alpha$ versus [O III]/H$\beta$ diagram at
high redshift are therefore due to [NII] emission, likely as a result of
relatively high N/O abundance. If this is indeed the case, then nitrogen-based
metallicity diagnostics suffer from systematic errors at high redshift. Our
findings indicate that locally calibrated abundance diagnostics based on
alpha-capture elements can be reliably applied at z$\simeq$1 and possibly at
much higher redshifts. This constitutes the first firm basis for the widespread
use of empirical calibrations in high redshift metallicity studies.

with its attendant problems. In this ""accreting Boulware"" scenario, a positive
flux $F$ is still an outflux at infinity, but near the horizon it becomes an
influx of negative energy. This negative energy flux (marginally) satisfies the
Flanagan energy inequality.

emission, and (3) the relative weakness of the [SII] optical emission lines. We
use these diagnostics to rank-order our sample in terms of likely leakiness,
noting that a direct measure of escaping Lyman continuum has recently been made
for one of the leakiest members of our sample. We then examine the correlations

radiation and strong pressure from both radiation and a hot galactic wind-
combines to create significant holes in the neutral gas. These results not only
shed new light on the physical mechanisms that can allow ionizing radiation to
escape from intensely star-forming galaxies, they also provide indirect
observational indicators that can be used at high-redshift where direct
measurements of escaping Lyman continuum radiation are impossible.

Two Micron All Sky Survey for our analysis. We also used a new sample of galaxy
groups identified in the 2M++ galaxy redshift catalogue as tracers of the
large-scale structure. We defined a procedure to search in redshift space for
compact groups that can be considered embedded in other overdense systems and
applied this criterion to several possible combinations of different compact
and galaxy group subsamples. We also performed similar analyses for simulated
compact and galaxy groups identified in a 2M++ mock galaxy catalogue
constructed from the Millennium Run Simulation I plus a semi-analytical model
of galaxy formation. We observed that only $\sim27\%$ of the compact groups can
be considered to be embedded in larger overdense systems, that is, most of the
compact groups are more likely to be isolated systems. The embedded compact
groups show statistically smaller sizes and brighter surface brightnesses than
non-embedded systems. No evidence was found that embedded compact groups are
more likely to inhabit galaxy groups with a given virial mass or with a
particular dynamical state. We found very similar results when the analysis was
performed using mock compact and galaxy groups. Based on the semi-analytical
studies, we predict that $70\%$ of the embedded compact groups probably are 3D
physically dense systems. Finally, real space information allowed us to reveal
the bimodal behaviour of the distribution of 3D minimum distances between
compact and galaxy groups. The location of compact groups should be carefully
taken into account when comparing properties of galaxies in environments that
are a priori different.

of Software. This new workshop combines the strengths of two pre-existing
workshop series: GT-VMT (Graph Transformation and Visual Modelling Techniques)
and GRAPHITE (Graph Inspection and Traversal Engineering).
  Graphs are used as models in all areas of computer science: examples are
state space graphs, control flow graphs, syntax graphs, UML-type models of all
kinds, network layouts, social networks, dependency graphs, and so forth. Used
to model a particular phenomenon or process, graphs are then typically analysed
to find out properties of the modelled subject, or transformed to construct
other types of models.
  The workshop aimed at attracting and stimulating research on the techniques
for graph analysis, inspection and transformation, on a general level rather
than in any specific domain. In total, we received 15 submissions covering
several different areas. Of these 15 submissions, nine were eventually accepted
and appear in this volume.

we take an alternative route and construct a stellar structure formalism which,
without adhering to any particular theory of gravity, describes in a simple
parametrized form the departure from compact stars in general relativity. This
""post-Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV)"" formalism for spherical static stars is
inspired by the well-known parametrized post-Newtonian theory, extended to
second post-Newtonian order by adding suitable correction terms to the fully
relativistic TOV equations. We show how neutron star properties are modified
within our formalism, paying special attention to the effect of each correction
term. We also show that the formalism is equivalent to general relativity with
an ""effective"" (gravity-modified) equation of state.

\to h^* \to ZZ$ to bound the Higgs width, under specific model-dependent
assumptions, has recently received a lot of attention. As off-shell cross
section measurements in this channel suffer from a small signal yield, large
backgrounds, and theoretical uncertainties, we propose an alternative
complementary constraint which is only possible through the combination of LEP
and LHC measurements. Previous precision electroweak measurements at LEP allow
for the determination of indirect constraints on Higgs couplings to vector
bosons by considering one-loop processes involving virtual Higgs exchange. As
the Higgs is off-shell in these diagrams we venture that LEP can be interpreted
as an off-shell `Higgs Factory'. By combining these LEP constraints with
current LHC 8 TeV Higgs measurements a stronger limit on the Higgs width can be
achieved than with LHC data alone for models with rescaled Higgs couplings.
Looking to the future, avoiding ambiguities arising due to new physics
modifications of the $hGG$ coupling, a theoretically more robust constraint can
be achieved by correlating LEP measurements with WBF Higgs production followed
by Higgs decays to $WW$ and $ZZ$. This method for indirectly constraining the
Higgs width is very effective for specific BSM scenarios and is highly
complementary to other proposed methods. The limits we obtain particularly
highlight the power of a concrete LEP+LHC combination, not only limited to
Higgs width measurements.

fundamentally different pathways for melting of long-range order at weak and
strong interaction. In the Mott insulating regime, melting of long-range order
occurs due to the ultra-fast transfer of energy from charge excitations to the
spin background, while local magnetic moments and their exchange coupling
persist during the process. The latter can be demonstrated by a local
spin-precession experiment. At weak interaction, local moments decay along with
the long-range order. The dynamics is governed by residual quasiparticles,
which are reflected in oscillations of the off-diagonal components of the
momentum distribution. Such oscillations provide an alternative route to study
the prethermalization phenomenon and its influence on the dynamics away from
the integrable (noninteracting) limit. The Hubbard model is solved within

rate and the physical CDM density parameter today, $\omega_c$, allowing a large

star-forming subhalos. If this is representative, dwarf galaxies throughout the

our results with the ELVIS simulations to show that targeting $\sim 50~ \rm
kpc$ regions around nearby isolated dwarfs could increase the chances of
discovering ultra-faint galaxies by $\sim 35\%$ compared to random halo

massive objects retain a larger fraction of heavy elements. Young tidal dwarf
galaxies (TDGs), born in the tidal tails produced by interacting gas-rich
galaxies, have been thought to not follow the MZ relation, because they inherit
the metallicity of the more massive parent galaxies. We present chemical
evolution models to investigate if TDGs that formed at very high redshifts,
where the metallicity of their parent galaxy was very low, can produce the
observed MZ relation. Assuming that galaxy interactions were more frequent in
the denser high-redshift universe, TDGs could constitute an important
contribution to the dwarf galaxy population. The survey of chemical evolution
models of TDGs presented here captures for the first time an initial mass
function (IMF) of stars that is dependent on both the star formation rate and
the gas metallicity via the integrated galactic IMF (IGIMF) theory. As TDGs
form in the tidal debris of interacting galaxies, the pre-enrichment of the
gas, an underlying pre-existing stellar population, infall, and mass dependent
outflows are considered. The models of young TDGs that are created in strongly
pre-enriched tidal arms with a pre-existing stellar population can explain the
measured abundance ratios of observed TDGs. The same chemical evolution models
for TDGs, that form out of gas with initially very low metallicity, naturally
build up the observed MZ relation. The modelled chemical composition of ancient
TDGs is therefore consistent with the observed MZ relation of satellite
galaxies.

dominate the massive host population but are only rarely seen associated with
low-mass hosts, indicating that massive star-forming galaxies are universally
and (to some extent) homogeneously dusty at high-redshift while low-mass
star-forming galaxies retain little dust in their ISM. Comparing our luminosity
distributions to field surveys and measurements of the high-z mass-metallicity
relation, our results have good consistency with a model in which the GRB rate
per unit star-formation is constant in galaxies with gas-phase metallicity
below approximately the Solar value but heavily suppressed in more metal-rich

model two scenarios for the history of these systems. The first explains the
gas abundances in DLAs by a single burst of star formation. This model can
produce the observed DLA abundances, but does not provide an explanation as to
why the DLAs show suppressed [$\alpha$/Fe] compared to the stellar population
of UFDs. The second scenario splits the DLAs into a population which is
enriched by a single burst, and a population that is enriched by a second burst

[$\alpha$/Fe] in DLAs compared to UFDs results from enrichment of second-burst

outline our host-galaxy observational program, consisting of deep Spitzer/IRAC

photometry, plus spectroscopy of events without pre-existing redshifts. Our
optimized selection cuts combined with host-galaxy follow-up have so far
enabled redshift measurements for 110 targets (92%) and placed upper limits on
all but one of the remainder. About 20% of GRBs in the sample are heavily
dust-obscured, and at most 2% originate from z>5.5. Using this sample we
estimate the redshift-dependent GRB rate density, showing it to peak at z~2.5
and fall by about an order of magnitude towards low (z=0) redshift, while
declining more gradually towards high (z~7) redshift. This behavior is
consistent with a progenitor whose formation efficiency varies modestly over
cosmic history. Our survey will permit the most detailed examination to date of
the connection between the GRB host population and general star-forming
galaxies, directly measure evolution in the host population over cosmic time

population properties extending to beyond twice the effective radius (~2.5
R_e). Specifically, we examine trends in age, metallicity, and abundance ratios
of Mg, C, N, and Ca, and discuss the implications for star formation histories
and elemental yields. At a fixed physical radius of 3-6 kpc (the likely size of
the galaxy cores formed at high redshift) stellar age and [alpha/Fe] increase
with increasing sigma* and depend only weakly on stellar mass, as we might
expect if denser galaxies form their central cores earlier and faster. If we
instead focus on 1-1.5 R_e, the trends in abundance and abundance ratio are
washed out, as might be expected if the stars at large radius were accreted by
smaller galaxies. Finally, we show that when controlling for \sigmastar, there
are only very subtle differences in stellar population properties or gradients
as a function of group richness; even at large radius internal properties
matter more than environment in determining star formation history.

different spatial concentration and the different line-of-sight distance (~5
pc) of the two populations. The observed 1-2 Myr age difference between the two
populations is also naturally explained by our scenario, in which the two
sub-clusters formed in two slightly different star formation episodes. Our
simulations suggest that population B is strongly supervirial, while population
A is close to virial equilibrium. We discuss the implications of our models for
the formation of young star clusters and OB associations in the Milky Way.

\otimes SU(2)_R$ symmetry only broken by the Yukawa interactions. The pattern
of vacuum expectation values of the neutral doublet and triplet scalar fields
depends on the symmetry pattern of the Higgs soft breaking masses. We study the
cases where this symmetry is maintained in the Higgs sector, and when it is
broken only by the two doublets attaining different vacuum expectation values.
In the former case, the symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the vectorial

level, allowing for light triplet scalars with large vacuum expectation values.
We find that over a large range of parameter space, a light neutralino can
supply the correct relic abundance of dark matter either through resonant
s-channel triplet scalar funnels or well tempering of the Bino with the triplet
fermions. Direct detection experiments have trouble probing these model points
because the custodial symmetry suppresses the coupling of the neutralino and
the $Z$ and a small Higgsino component of the neutralino suppresses the
coupling with the Higgs. Likewise the annihilation cross sections for indirect
detection lie below the Fermi-LAT upper bounds for the different channels.

long-standing mystery. We argue that the high stellar density in the central
parsec around the GC is likely to result in a pulsar population dominated by
millisecond pulsars (MSPs), similar to the situation in globular cluster
environments. Earlier GC pulsar searches have been largely insensitive to such
an MSP population, accounting for the lack of pulsar detections. We estimate
the best search frequency for such an MSP population with present and upcoming
broad-band radio telescopes for two possible scattering scenarios, the
""weak-scattering"" case suggested by the recent detection of a magnetar close to
the GC, and the ""strong-scattering"" case, with the scattering screen located
close to the GC. The optimal search frequencies are $\approx 8$ GHz
(weak-scattering) and $\approx 25$ GHz (strong-scattering), for pulsars with
periods 1-20 ms, assuming that GC pulsars have a luminosity distribution
similar to that those in the rest of the Milky Way. We find that 10-30 hour
integrations with the Very Large Array and the Green Bank Telescope would be
sufficient to detect MSPs at the GC distance in the weak-scattering case.
However, if the strong-scattering case is indeed applicable to the GC,
observations with the full Square Kilometre Array would be needed to detect the
putative MSP population.

lines superconductors, charge density waves, and transport processes of

the multidimensional extension of the Kramers problem of a single Brownian
particle. In comparison to the latter case, however, the dynamics ensuing from
the interactions of many coupled units can lead to intriguing novel phenomena
that are not present when only a single degree of freedom is involved. In this
review we report on a variety of such phenomena that are exhibited by systems
consisting of chains of interacting units in the presence of potential
barriers.
  In the first part we consider recent developments in the case of a
deterministic dynamics driving cooperative escape processes of coupled
nonlinear units out of metastable states. The ability of chains of coupled
units to undergo spontaneous conformational transitions can lead to a
self-organised escape. The mechanism at work is that the energies of the units
become re-arranged, while keeping the total energy conserved, in forming
localised energy modes that in turn trigger the cooperative escape. We present
scenarios of significantly enhanced noise-free escape rates if compared to the
noise-assisted case.
  The second part deals with the collective directed transport of systems of
interacting particles overcoming energetic barriers in periodic potential
landscapes. Escape processes in both time-homogeneous and time-dependent driven
systems are considered for the emergence of directed motion. It is shown that
ballistic channels immersed in the associated high-dimensional phase space are
the source for the directed long-range transport.

  Parameter-Varying Systems",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A general framework is presented for analyzing the stability and performance
of nonlinear and linear parameter varying (LPV) time delayed systems. First,
the input/output behavior of the time delay operator is bounded in the
frequency domain by integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). A constant delay is
a linear, time-invariant system and this leads to a simple, intuitive
interpretation for these frequency domain constraints. This simple
interpretation is used to derive new IQCs for both constant and varying delays.
Second, the performance of nonlinear and LPV delayed systems is bounded using
dissipation inequalities that incorporate IQCs. This step makes use of recent
results that show, under mild technical conditions, that an IQC has an
equivalent representation as a finite-horizon time-domain constraint. Numerical
examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for both
class of systems.

resulting from a laser beam's propagation through atmospheric turbulence.
Compared with the commonly restricted domain of (-pi, pi) in phase
reconstruction by interferometers, the reconstructed phase obtained by the
plenoptic sensors can be continuous up to a multiple of 2pi. When compared with
conventional Shack-Hartmann sensors, ambiguities caused by interference or low
intensity, such as branch points and branch cuts, are less likely to happen and
can be adaptively avoided by our reconstruction algorithm. In the design of our
plenoptic sensor, we modified the fundamental structure of a light field camera
into a mini Keplerian telescope array by accurately cascading the back focal
plane of its object lens with a microlens array's front focal plane and
matching the numerical aperture of both components. Unlike light field cameras
designed for incoherent imaging purposes, our plenoptic sensor operates on the
complex amplitude of the incident beam and distributes it into a matrix of
images that are simpler and less subject to interference than a global image of
the beam. Then, with the proposed reconstruction algorithms, the plenoptic
sensor is able to reconstruct the wavefront and a phase screen at an
appropriate depth in the field that causes the equivalent distortion on the
beam. The reconstructed results can be used to guide adaptive optics systems in
directing beam propagation through atmospheric turbulence. In this paper we
will show the theoretical analysis and experimental results obtained with the
plenoptic sensor and its reconstruction algorithms.

gas dynamics PDE equations over the pipelines, together with boundary
conditions at junctions, are reduced using lumped elements to a sparse
nonlinear ODE system expressed in vector-matrix form using graph theoretic

consistent discretization of the PDE equations for gas flow. The RNF forms the
dynamic constraints for optimal control problems for pipeline systems with
known time-varying withdrawals and injections and gas pressure limits
throughout the network. The objectives include economic transient compression
(ETC) and minimum load shedding (MLS), which involve minimizing compression
costs or, if that is infeasible, minimizing the unfulfilled deliveries,
respectively. These continuous functional optimization problems are
approximated using the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) pseudospectral collocation

approximately independent of the star's internal structure. This approximate,
equation-of-state universality arises after one adimensionalizes the multipole
moments appropriately, which then begs the question of whether there are better
ways to adimensionalize the moments to obtain stronger universality. We here
investigate this question in detail by considering slowly-rotating neutron
stars both in the non-relativistic limit and in full General Relativity. We
find that there exist normalizations that lead to stronger equation-of-state
universality in the relations among the moment of inertia and the quadrupole,
octopole and hexadecapole moments of neutron stars. We determine the optimal
normalization that minimizes the equation-of-state dependence in these

X-ray pulses and atomic line profiles from millisecond pulsars with NICER and

luminosity dependence in IA observations. The increase in IA amplitude for more
highly biased galaxies reflects their locations in regions with large tidal

significant improvement on small and intermediate scales. We also show that the
cross-correlation between density and IA (the ""GI"" term) can be effectively
separated into source alignment and source clustering, and we accurately model
the observed alignment down to the one-halo regime using the tidal field from
the fully nonlinear halo-matter cross correlation. Inside the one-halo regime,
the average alignment of galaxies with density tracers no longer follows the

considered when modeling IA on these scales. Finally, we discuss tidal

facet of quantum theory that entanglement can exist between microscopic and
macroscopic systems, producing a superposition of distinguishable states like
the fictitious cat that is both alive and dead. The hallmark of entanglement is
the detection of strong correlations between systems, for example by the
violation of Bell's inequality. Using the CHSH variant of the Bell test, this
violation has been observed with photons, atoms, solid state spins, and
artificial atoms in superconducting circuits. For larger, more distinguishable
states, the conflict between quantum predictions and our classical expectations
is typically resolved due to the rapid onset of decoherence. To investigate
this reconciliation, one can employ a superposition of coherent states in an
oscillator, known as a cat state. In contrast to discrete systems, one can
continuously vary the size of the prepared cat state and therefore its
dependence on decoherence. Here we demonstrate and quantify entanglement
between an artificial atom and a cat state in a cavity, which we call a
`Bell-cat' state. We use a circuit QED architecture, high-fidelity
measurements, and real-time feedback control to violate Bell's inequality
without post-selection or corrections for measurement inefficiencies.
Furthermore, we investigate the influence of decoherence by continuously
varying the size of created Bell-cat states and characterize the entangled
system by joint Wigner tomography. These techniques provide a toolset for
quantum information processing with entangled qubits and resonators. While
recent results have demonstrated a high level of control of such systems, this
experiment demonstrates that information can be extracted efficiently and with
high fidelity, a crucial requirement for quantum computing with resonators.

system, we develop a new locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme, Tunable-LSH.
Using Tunable-LSH, records that are co-accessed across similar sets of queries
can be hashed to the same or nearby physical pages in the storage system. What
sets Tunable-LSH apart from existing LSH schemes is that it can auto-tune to
achieve the aforementioned clustering objective with high accuracy even when
the workloads change. Experimental evaluation of Tunable-LSH in our prototype
RDF data management system, chameleon-db, as well as in a standalone hashtable
shows significant end-to-end improvements over existing solutions.

suitably coupled to two distinct set of scalar fields in the adjoint
representation of $SU({\cal N})$, which are forming a doublet and a triplet,
respectively under a global $SU(2)$ symmetry. We show that a direct sum of
fuzzy spheres $S_F^{2 \, Int} := S_F^2(\ell) \oplus S_F^2 (\ell) \oplus S_F^2
\left ( \ell + \frac{1}{2} \right ) \oplus S_F^2 \left ( \ell - \frac{1}{2}

gauge symmetry and lay the way for us to interpret the spontaneously broken
model as a $U(n)$ gauge theory over ${\cal M} \times S_F^{2 \, Int}$. Focusing
on a $U(2)$ gauge theory we present complete parameterizations of the
$SU(2)$-equivariant, scalar, spinor and vector fields characterizing the
effective low energy features of this model. Next, we direct our attention to
the monopole bundles $S_F^{2 \, \pm} := S_F^2 (\ell) \oplus S_F^2 \left ( \ell
\pm \frac{1}{2} \right )$ over $S_F^2 (\ell)$ with winding numbers $\pm 1$,
which naturally come forth through certain projections of $S_F^{2 \, Int}$, and
discuss the low energy behaviour of the $U(2)$ gauge theory over ${\cal M}
\times S_F^{2 \, \pm}$. We study models with $k$-component multiplet of the
global $SU(2)$, give their vacuum solutions and obtain a class of winding
number $\pm (k-1)$ monopole bundles $S_F^{2 \,, \pm (k-1)}$ as certain
projections of these vacuum solutions. We make the observation that $S_F^{2 \,
Int}$ is indeed the bosonic part of the $N=2$ fuzzy supersphere with $OSP(2,2)$
supersymmetry and construct the generators of the $osp(2,2)$ Lie superalgebra
in two of its irreducible representations using the matrix content of the
vacuum solution $S_F^{2 \, Int}$. Finally, we show that our vacuum solutions
are stable by demonstrating that they form mixed states with non-zero von

spectral data of three small EBs were obtained on 2013 June 6 with the largest
solar telescope, the 1.6 meter New Solar Telescope (NST), at the Big Bear Solar
Observatory. The characteristics of these EBs are analyzed. The sizes of the
EBs are in the range of 0.3\arcsec\--0.8\arcsec\ and their durations are only
3--5 minutes. Our semi-empirical atmospheric models indicate that the heating
occurs around the temperature minimum region with a temperature increase of
2700--3000 K, which is surprisingly higher than previously thought. The
radiative and kinetic energies are estimated to be as high as
5$\times$10$^{25}$--3.0$\times$10$^{26}$ ergs despite the small size of these
EBs. Observations of the magnetic field show that the EBs appeared just in a
parasitic region with mixed polarities and accompanied by mass motions.
Nonlinear force-free field extrapolation reveals that the three EBs are
connected with a series of magnetic field lines associated with bald patches,
which strongly implies that these EBs should be produced by magnetic
reconnection in the solar lower atmosphere. According to the lightcurves and
the estimated magnetic reconnection rate, we propose that there is a three
phase process in EBs: pre-heating, flaring and cooling phases.

nonorthogonal states in high dimensional Hilbert spaces for use in quantum
information processing. The method is illustrated for the case of photon
orbital angular momentum (OAM) states. These states belong to pairs of bases
that are mutually unbiased on a sequence of two-dimensional subspaces of the
full Hilbert space, but the vectors within the same basis are not necessarily
orthogonal to each other. Over multiple trials, this method allows
distinguishing OAM eigenstates from superpositions of multiple such
eigenstates. Variations of the same method are then shown to be capable of
preparing and detecting arbitrary linear combinations of states in Hilbert
space. One further variation allows the construction of chains of states
obeying recurrence relations on the Hilbert space itself, opening a new range
of possibilities for more abstract information-coding algorithms to be carried
out experimentally in a simple manner. Among other applications, we show that
this approach provides a simplified means of switching between pairs of
high-dimensional mutually unbiased OAM bases.

primarily on dust shielding, we investigate the relationship between CO
emission ($I_{\rm CO}$) and the amount of dust (estimated from IR emission and
expressed as ""$A_V$"") across the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Small Magellanic
Cloud, and the Milky Way. We show that at our common resolution of 10 pc
scales, $I_{\rm CO}$ given a fixed line-of-sight $A_V$ is similar across all
three systems despite the difference in metallicity. We find some evidence for
a secondary dependence of $I_{\rm CO}$ on radiation field; in the LMC, $I_{\rm
CO}$ at a given $A_V$ is smaller in regions of high $T_{\rm dust}$, perhaps
because of an increased photodissociating radiation field. We suggest a simple
but useful picture in which the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor (\xco) depends on
two separable factors: (1) the distribution of gas column densities, which maps
to an extinction distribution via a dust-to-gas ratio; and (2) the dependence
of $I_{\rm CO}$ on $A_V$. Assuming that the probability distribution function
(PDF) of local Milky Way clouds is universal, this approach predicts a
dependence of \xco\ on $Z$ between $Z^{-1}$ and $Z^{-2}$ above about a third
solar metallicity. Below this metallicity, CO emerges from only the high column
density parts of the cloud and so depends very sensitively on the adopted PDF
and the H$_2$/{\sc Hi} prescription. The PDF of low metallicity clouds is thus
of considerable interest and the uncertainty associated with even an ideal
prescription for \xco\ at very low metallicity will be large.

describes the final state interaction of D+-> K-pi+pi+ as multiple
rescatterings of three pseudoscalar mesons through two-pseudoscalar-meson
interactions in accordance with the two-body and three-body unitarity. The
two-pseudoscalar-meson interactions are designed to reproduce empirical pi pi
and pi bar K scattering amplitudes. Furthermore, we also include mechanisms
that are beyond simple iterations of the two-body interactions, i.e., a
three-meson force, derived from the hidden local symmetry model. A picture of
hadronic dynamics in D+-> K-pi+pi+ described by our coupled-channel model is
found to be quite different from those of the previous isobar-type analyses.
For example, we find that the D+-> K-pi+pi+ decay width can get almost
triplicated when the rescattering mechanisms are turned on. Among the
rescattering mechanisms, those associated with the rho(770) bar K0 channel,
which contribute to D+-> K-pi+pi+ only through a channel coupling, give a large
contribution, and significantly improve the quality of the fits. The K-pi+
s-wave amplitude from our analysis is reasonably consistent with those
extracted from the E791 model independent partial-wave analysis; the hadronic
rescattering and the coupling to the rho(770) bar K0 channel play a major role
here. We also find that the dressed D+ decay vertices have phases, induced by
the strong rescatterings, that strongly depend on the momenta of the final
pseudoscalar mesons. Although the conventional isobar-type analyses have
assumed the phases to be constant, this common assumption is not supported by
our more microscopic viewpoint.

be 10h 39m 22.4s. When the Cassini spacecraft measured a period of 10h 47m 6s,
which was additionally found to change between sequential measurements, it
became clear that the radio period could not be used to determine the bulk
planetary rotation period. Estimates based upon Saturn's measured wind fields
have increased the uncertainty even more, giving numbers smaller than the
Voyager rotation period, and at present Saturn's rotation period is thought to
be between 10h 32m and 10h 47m, which is unsatisfactory for such a fundamental
property. Here we report a period of 10h 32m 45s +- 46s, based upon an
optimization approach using Saturn's measured gravitational field and limits on
the observed shape and possible internal density profiles. Moreover, even when
solely using the constraints from its gravitational field, the rotation period
can be inferred with a precision of several minutes. To validate our method, we
applied the same procedure to Jupiter and correctly recovered its well-known
rotation period.

structures including a broad main sequence, an extended main sequence turn-off
and an extended red giant clump. The reason for such special CMDs remains
unclear. In order to test how different the results from various stellar
population assumptions are, we study a high-quality CMD of NGC1651 from the
Hubble Space Telescope archive via eight kinds of models. Distance modulus,
extinction, age ranges, star formation mode, fraction of binaries, and fraction
of rotational stars are determined and then compared. The results show that
stellar populations both with and without age spread can reproduce the special
structure of the observed CMD. A composite population with extended star
formation from 1.8\,Gyrs ago to 1.4\,Gyrs ago, which contains 50 per cent
binaries and 70 per cent rotational stars, fits the observed CMD best.
Meanwhile, a 1.5\,Gyr-old simple population that consists of rotational stars
can also fit the observed CMD well. The results of CMD fitting are shown to
depend strongly on stellar population type (simple or composite), and fraction
of rotators. If the member stars of NGC1651 formed in a single star burst, the
effect of stellar rotation should be very important for the explanation of
observed CMDs. Otherwise, the effect may be small. It is also possible that the
special observed CMD is a result of the combined effects of stellar binarity,
rotation and age spread. Therefore, further work on stellar population type and
fraction of rotational stars of intermediate-age clusters are necessary to
understand their observed CMDs.

$k$-means/median/center assume that the optimal clusters satisfy the locality

of clustering problems arise in machine learning where the optimal clusters do
not follow such a locality property. Consider a variant of the $k$-means
problem that may be regarded as a general version of such problems. Here, the
optimal clusters $O_1, ..., O_k$ are an arbitrary partition of the dataset and
the goal is to output $k$-centers $c_1, ..., c_k$ such that the objective
function $\sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in O_{i}} ||x - c_{i}||^2$ is minimized. It
is not difficult to argue that any algorithm (without knowing the optimal
clusters) that outputs a single set of $k$ centers, will not behave well as far
as optimizing the above objective function is concerned. However, this does not
rule out the existence of algorithms that output a list of such $k$ centers
such that at least one of these $k$ centers behaves well. Given an error
parameter $\varepsilon > 0$, let $\ell$ denote the size of the smallest list of
$k$-centers such that at least one of the $k$-centers gives a $(1+\varepsilon)$

lower bound of $2^{\tilde{\Omega}(k/\sqrt{\varepsilon})}$. Moreover, our
algorithm runs in time $O \left(n d \cdot 2^{\tilde{O}(k/\varepsilon)}

at small frequencies (corresponding to the sub-Hz range relevant for planned

evident failure of stellar rotation (including resolved and unresolved binary
stars) to interpret the CMDs of three star clusters, and the unexpected success
of age spread. In particular, the special structures of turn-off and red clump
parts cannot be generated by stellar rotation, but age spread perfectly
reproduces the observed features. This suggests that these three clusters
contain multiple populations of stars, rather than a single population of
rotating stars and binaries. The thick subgiant branch of NGC 1831 gives the
strongest support to this. The results demonstrate that stellar rotation cannot
save the widely accepted view (simple population) of star clusters, and an
extended star formation history is needed for explaining the observed CMDs. In
addition, this work shows that a narrow subgiant branch does not correspond to
a simple population. The judgement of simple population in NGC 1651 by a
previous work is not necessarily reliable. We anticipate our assay to be a
starting point for more precise study of Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams of star
clusters. This involves many factors, such as binaries, rotating stars, and

theories of the steady Boltzmann and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations

which solutions of the steady Boltzmann equation have an asymptotic behavior
described by the steady Navier-Stokes Fourier system. Whether this system
includes the viscous heating term depends on the ratio of the Froude number to
the Mach number of the gas flow. While the steady Navier-Stokes equations with
smooth divergence-free external force always have at least one smooth
solutions, the Boltzmann equation with the same external force set in the
torus, or in a bounded domain with specular reflection of gas molecules at the
boundary may fail to have any solution, unless the force field is identically
zero. Viscous heating seems to be of key importance in this situation. The
nonexistence of any steady solution of the Boltzmann equation in this context
seems related to the increase of temperature for the evolution problem, a
phenomenon that we have established with the help of numerical simulations on
the Boltzmann equation and the BGK model.

uses finite difference routines to compute the potential for the same grid
resolution. Finally we show that a lognormal transform of the overdensity, used
as a proxy for the linear overdensity, is beneficial in estimating the full
displacement field from a dense sample of tracers. However the lognormal
transform of the overdensity does not perform well when estimating the
displacements from sparser simulations with a more realistic galaxy density.

contains only glucose, NaOH and small amount of methylene blue. The solution
turns blue when shaken and fades to colorless upon standing. This
bluing/de-bluing cycle may be repeated and may be compared to blood colors in
animal's respiratory cycle. Inspired by the blue bottle experiment, the
colorful chemical bottle experiment kit was commercially developed in 2006. The
kit is a versatile pedagogical tool, not only for physical chemistry but also
for analytical, biological and organic chemistry. It also helps teaching
concepts in scientific method and laboratory safety. This manuscript contains
four parts, brief review on literature relating to the blue bottle experiment,
description of the colorful chemical bottle experiment kit, pedagogical
discussion of the experiments and preliminary evaluation from students.

problems in Shannon's information theory where we depart from the requirement

the error probabilities for various problems are bounded above by a

functions of the growing blocklengths. This represents the study of asymptotic
estimates with non-vanishing error probabilities.
  In Part I, after reviewing the fundamentals of information theory, we discuss
Strassen's seminal result for binary hypothesis testing where the type-I error
probability is non-vanishing and the rate of decay of the type-II error
probability with growing number of independent observations is characterized.
In Part II, we use this basic hypothesis testing result to develop second- and
sometimes, even third-order asymptotic expansions for point-to-point
communication. Finally in Part III, we consider network information theory
problems for which the second-order asymptotics are known. These problems
include some classes of channels with random state, the multiple-encoder
distributed lossless source coding (Slepian-Wolf) problem and special cases of
the Gaussian interference and multiple-access channels. Finally, we discuss

feature-rich control planes for data center networks. However, the tight
coupling of centralized control and complete visibility leads to a wide range
of issues among which scalability has risen to prominence. To address this, we
present LazyCtrl, a novel hybrid control plane design for data center networks
where network control is carried out by distributed control mechanisms inside
independent groups of switches while complemented with a global controller. Our
design is motivated by the observation that data center traffic is usually
highly skewed and thus edge switches can be grouped according to traffic
locality. LazyCtrl aims at bringing laziness to the global controller by
dynamically devolving most of the control tasks to independent switch groups to
process frequent intra-group events near datapaths while handling rare
inter-group or other specified events by the controller. We implement LazyCtrl
and build a prototype based on Open vSwich and Floodlight. Trace-driven
experiments on our prototype show that an effective switch grouping is easy to
maintain in multi-tenant clouds and the central controller can be significantly
shielded by staying lazy, with its workload reduced by up to 82%.

Despite the practical importance of analysing SCOOP programs, there are

partially conflicting semantic formalisations for SCOOP (either in theory or

programs by automatic translation to GTS, we also highlight our experiences of
applying GTS (and especially GROOVE) for specifying semantics in the form of a
run-time model, which should be transferable to GTS models for other concurrent

graphical structure can be found, corresponding to every hierarchical term.
Evaluating such a graphical structure in some target algebra yields a dynamic

the original graph. We apply our approach to the parking optimization problem

strategies for both players, which are evolution-independent, and determine the
exact amount of information a universal strategy needs about the history of a
play and the evolution of the lookahead to be winning. In particular, we show
that delay games with Borel winning conditions are determined with respect to
universal strategies. Finally, we consider decidability problems, e.g., ""Does a
player have a universal winning strategy for delay games with a given winning
condition?"", for omega-regular and omega-context-free winning conditions.

baryon-baryon channels with total strangeness S=-2. The potential models for
S=-2 are based on SU(3) extensions of ESC potential models for the S=0 and S=-1
sectors, which are fitted to experimental data. Flavor SU(3)-symmetry is broken
only kinematically by the masses of the baryons and the mesons. For the S=-2
channels no experimental scattering data exist, and also the information from
hypernuclei is rather limited. Nevertheless, in the fit to the S=0 and S=-1
sectors information from the so called NAGARA event and the $\Xi$-well-depth
has been used as constraints to determine the free parameters in the
simultaneous fit of the $NN \oplus YN \oplus YY$ data. Therefore, the
potentials for the S=-2 sector are determined mainly by the NN-, YN-data, and
SU(3)-symmetry.Various properties of the potentials are illustrated by giving
results for scattering lengths, effective ranges, bound states, elastic and
inelastic phase parameters, and total cross sections. Notably is the prediction
of a bound state D$^*$ in the $\Xi N(^3S_1,I=1)$-channel with a binding energy
$B_E=1.56$ MeV. This state is deuteron-like, i.e. a member of the
$\{10^*\}$-decuplet. As for the normal deuteron $D= pn(^3S_1-^3D_1)$ the strong
tensor force is responsible for this state. The features of $\Xi$ hypernuclei
predicted by ESC08c are studied on the basis of the G-matrix approch. The
well-depth $U_\Xi= -7.0$ MeV, and the $\Xi -\Lambda\Lambda$ conversion width is
$\Gamma_\Xi^c= 4.5$ MeV.

progenitor stars of core-collapse supernovae in high resolution archival images
of their galaxies.This review compiles results (from 1999 - 2013) in a distance
limited sample and discusses the implications. The vast majority of the
detections of progenitor stars are of type II-P, II-L or IIb with one type Ib
progenitor system detected and many more upper limits for progenitors of Ibc
supernovae (14). The data for these 45 supernovae progenitors illustrate a
remarkable deficit of high luminosity stars above an apparent limit of Log L ~=
5.1 dex. For a typical Salpeter IMF, one would expect to have found 13 high
luminosity and high mass progenitors. There is, possibly, only one object in
this time and volume limited sample that is unambiguously high mass (the
progenitor of SN2009ip). The possible biases due to the influence of
circumstellar dust and sample selection methods are reviewed. It does not
appear likely that these can explain the missing high mass progenitor stars.
This review concludes that the observed populations of supernovae in the local
Universe are not, on the whole, produced by high mass (M > ~18Msun) stars.
Theoretical explosions of model stars also predict that black hole formation
and failed supernovae tend to occur above M > ~18Msun. The models also suggest
there are islands of explodability for stars in the 8-120Msun range. The
observational constraints are quite consistent with the bulk of stars above M >
~18Msun collapsing to form black holes with no visible supernovae. (Abridged).

unbounded and time-dependent. Global existence of solutions to the Cauchy
problem is established within weighted continuous spaces by approximation and
monotonicity arguments. Every solution with non-zero initial value is shown to
exhibit a certain lower grow-up and radial growth bound, depending only upon
the sublinearity and the unbounded, time-dependent potential. Using the lower
grow-up/growth bound, we can prove the key comparison principle. Then we settle
the uniqueness of solutions for the problem with non-zero initial condition by
employing the comparison principle. For the problem with the zero initial
condition, we can classify the non-trivial solutions in terms of the maximal
solutions. When the initial condition has a power radial growth, we can derive
the precise asymptotic grow-up rate of solutions and obtain the critical growth
exponent.

general-purpose black-box optimization algorithms such as evolutionary
algorithms and other search heuristics. Different models exist, each one being
designed to analyze a different aspect of typical heuristics such as the memory
size or the variation operators in use. While most of the previous works focus
on one particular such aspect, we consider in this work how the combination of
several algorithmic restrictions influence the black-box complexity. Our
testbed are so-called OneMax functions, a classical set of test functions that
is intimately related to classic coin-weighing problems and to the board game
Mastermind.
  We analyze in particular the combined memory-restricted ranking-based
black-box complexity of OneMax for different memory sizes. While its isolated
memory-restricted as well as its ranking-based black-box complexity for bit
strings of length $n$ is only of order $n/\log n$, the combined model does not
allow for algorithms being faster than linear in $n$, as can be seen by
standard information-theoretic considerations. We show that this linear bound
is indeed asymptotically tight. Similar results are obtained for other memory-
and offspring-sizes. Our results also apply to the (Monte Carlo) complexity of
OneMax in the recently introduced elitist model, in which only the best-so-far
solution can be kept in the memory. Finally, we also provide improved lower
bounds for the complexity of OneMax in the regarded models.
  Our result enlivens the quest for natural evolutionary algorithms optimizing
OneMax in $o(n \log n)$ iterations.

scalar-vector-tensor gravitational model, in which the dark energy action is
described by a gauge invariant electromagnetic type functional. By assuming
that the ground state of the dark energy is in a form of a condensate with the
U(1) symmetry spontaneously broken, the gauge invariant electromagnetic dark
energy can be described in terms of the combination of a vector and of a scalar
field (corresponding to the Goldstone boson), respectively. The gravitational
field equations are obtained by also assuming the possibility of a non-minimal
coupling between the cosmological mass current and the superconducting dark
energy. The cosmological implications of the dark energy model are investigated
for a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker homogeneous and isotropic geometry for two
particular choices of the electromagnetic type potential, corresponding to a
pure electric type field, and to a pure magnetic field, respectively. The time
evolution of the scale factor, matter energy density and deceleration parameter
are obtained for both cases, and it is shown that in the presence of the
superconducting dark energy the Universe ends its evolution in an exponentially
accelerating vacuum de Sitter state. By using the formalism of the irreversible
thermodynamic processes for open systems we interpret the generalized
conservation equations in the superconducting dark energy model as describing
matter creation. The particle production rates, the creation pressure and the
entropy evolution are explicitly obtained.

Euler dG method. An adaptive algorithm is then proposed to utilise the error

algorithm is shown through a series of numerical experiments.
  Moving on to nonlinear problems, we investigate the numerical approximation

of blow-up in nonlinear ODEs through standard time stepping schemes. We then
derive an a posteriori error estimator for an implicit-explicit (IMEX) dG
discretisation of a semilinear parabolic PDE with quadratic nonlinearity. An
adaptive algorithm is proposed that uses the error estimator to approach the

fields over the spatial domain and first-order integrators or equivalently
truncated exponential filters coupled in cascade over the temporal domain.
  Compared to previous spatio-temporal scale-space formulations in terms of
non-enhancement of local extrema or scale invariance, these receptive fields
are based on different scale-space axiomatics over time by ensuring
non-creation of new local extrema or zero-crossings with increasing temporal
scale. Specifically, extensions are presented about (i) parameterizing the
intermediate temporal scale levels, (ii) analysing the resulting temporal
dynamics, (iii) transferring the theory to a discrete implementation, (iv)
computing scale-normalized spatio-temporal derivative expressions for
spatio-temporal feature detection and (v) computational modelling of receptive
fields in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex

  We show that by distributing the intermediate temporal scale levels according
to a logarithmic distribution, we obtain much faster temporal response
properties (shorter temporal delays) compared to a uniform distribution.
Specifically, these kernels converge very rapidly to a limit kernel possessing
true self-similar scale-invariant properties over temporal scales, thereby
allowing for true scale invariance over variations in the temporal scale,
although the underlying temporal scale-space representation is based on a
discretized temporal scale parameter.
  We show how scale-normalized temporal derivatives can be defined for these

computing basic types of scale-normalized spatio-temporal derivative

effect of thermal fluctuations on several signatures of the transition. We show
that scaling laws for bulk and shear moduli only become relevant when thermal
fluctuations are extremely small, and propose their relative ratio as a
quantitative signature of jamming criticality. Despite the nonequilibrium
nature of the transition, we find that thermally induced fluctuations and
mechanical responses obey equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relations near
jamming, provided the appropriate fluctuating component of the particle
displacements is analysed. This shows that mechanical moduli can be directly
measured from particle positions in mechanically unperturbed packings, and
suggests that the definition of a ""nonequilibrium index"" is unnecessary for
amorphous materials. We find that fluctuations of particle displacements are
spatially correlated, and define a transverse and a longitudinal correlation
lengthscales which both diverge as the jamming transition is approached. We
analyse the frozen component of density fluctuations and find that it displays
signatures of nearly-hyperuniform behaviour at large lengthscales. This
demonstrates that hyperuniformity in jammed packings is unrelated to a
vanishing compressibility and explains why it appears remarkably robust against
temperature and density variations. Differently from jamming criticality,
obstacles preventing the observation of hyperuniformity in colloidal systems do
not originate from thermal fluctuations.

normal stress on dense suspensions of spheres. The complete model includes
sphere-sphere contacts using a soft contact approach, short range hydrodynamic
interactions defined by frame-invariant expressions of forces and torques in
the lubrication approximation, and drag forces resulting from the
poromechanical coupling computed with the DEM-PFV technique. Series of
simulations in which some of the coupling terms are neglected highlight the
role of the poromechanical coupling in the transient regimes. They also reveal
that the shear component of the lubrication forces, though frequently neglected
in the literature, has a dominant effect in the volume changes. On the other
hand, the effects of lubrication torques are much less significant.
  The bulk shear stress is decomposed into contact stress and hydrodynamic
stress terms whose dependency on a dimensionless shear rate - the so called
viscous number $I_v$ - are examined. Both contributions are increasing
functions of $I_v$, contacts contribution dominates at low viscous number
($I_v<$0.15) whereas lubrication contributions are dominant for $I_v>$ 0.15,
consistently with a phenomenological law infered by other authors. Statistics
of microstructural variables highlight a complex interplay between solid
contacts and hydrodynamic interactions. In contrast with a popular idea, the
results suggest that lubrication may not necessarily reduce the contribution of
contact forces to the bulk shear stress. The proposed model is general and
applies directly to sheared immersed granular media in which pore pressure
feedback plays a key role (triggering of avalanches, liquefaction).

tasks between the two servers. Regarding the latter index, the ER topology
provides better performance than the BA case for smaller average degrees and
opposite behavior for larger average degrees. With respect to the cost, smaller
values are found in the BA topology irrespective of the average degree. In
addition, we also verified that it is easier to find good servers in the ER

with the large-scale structure across the FP could cause serious biases for
these cosmological probes, but may also yield new insights into the early-type

offsets in galaxy size from an FP that explicitly accounts for redshift trends,
using a sample of about $95,000$ elliptical galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. We show that these offsets correlate with the density field out to at

explanation for the correlations by dividing the sample into central,

observations strongly depends on assumptions of different grain sizes,
compositions and optical properties. Here we use a simple model of thermal
emission from cold silicate/carbon dust at a range of dust grain temperatures
and fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the Crab Nebula as a test.
This can lower the derived dust mass for the Crab by ~50% and 30-40% for
astronomical silicates and amorphous carbon grains compared to recently
published values (0.25M_sun -> 0.12M_sun and 0.12M_sun -> 0.072M_sun,
respectively), but the implied dust mass can also increase by as much as almost
a factor of six (0.25M_sun -> 1.14M_sun and 0.12M_sun -> 0.71M_sun) depending
on assumptions regarding the sizes/temperatures of the coldest grains. The
latter values are clearly unrealistic due to the expected metal budget, though.
Furthermore, we show by a simple numerical experiment that if a cold-dust
component does have a grain-temperature distribution, it is almost unavoidable
that a two-temperature fit will yield an incorrect dust mass estimate. But we
conclude that grain temperatures is not a greater uncertainty than the often
poorly constrained emissivities (i.e., material properties) of cosmic dust,
although there is clearly a need for improved dust emission models. The
greatest complication associated with deriving dust masses still arises in the
uncertainty in the dust composition.

into account both spatial proximity as well as user-defined criteria in order
to reveal patterns that were not perceivable with previous bundling techniques.
Each edge belongs to a group that may either be an input of the problem or
found by clustering one or more edge properties such as origin, destination,
orientation, length or domain-specific properties. Bundling is driven by a
stack of density maps, with each map capturing both the edge density of a given
group as well as interactions with edges from other groups. Density maps are
efficiently calculated by smoothing 2D histograms of edge occurrence using
repeated averaging filters based on integral images.
  A CPU implementation of the algorithm is tested on several graphs, and
different grouping criteria are used to illustrate how the proposed technique
can render different visualizations of the same data. Bundling performance is
much higher than on previous approaches, being particularly noticeable on large
graphs, with millions of edges being bundled in seconds.

packaging in viruses and sperm heads, and has been extensively studied using
single-molecule experimental methods. In those experiments, the values of the
critical condensation forces have been used to estimate the amplitude of the
attractive DNA-DNA interactions. Here, to describe these experiments, we
developed an analytical model and a rigid body Langevin dynamics assay to
investigate the behavior of a polymer with self-interactions, in the presence
of a traction force applied at its extremities. We model self-interactions
using a pairwise attractive potential, thereby treating the counterions
implicitly. The analytical model allows to accurately predict the equilibrium
structures of toroidal and rod-like condensed structures, and the dependence of
the critical condensation force on the DNA length. We find that the critical
condensation force depends strongly on the length of the DNA, and finite-size
effects are important for molecules of length up to 10^5 {\mu}m. Our Langevin
dynamics simulations show that the force-extension behavior of the rod-like
structures is very different from the toroidal ones, so that their presence in
experiments should be easily detectable. In double-stranded DNA condensation
experiments, the signature of the presence of rod-like structures was not
unambiguously detected, suggesting that the polyamines used to condense DNA may
protect it from bending sharply as needed in the rod-like structures

structure of Na$_{2}$IrO$_{3}$ using first-principles methods. Our calculations
reveal that total energy is minimized when the zigzag antiferromagnetic order
is magnetized along $\bm{g}\approx\bm{a}+\bm{c}$. Such a magnetic configuration
is explained by adding anisotropic interactions to the nearest-neighbor
Kitaev-Heisenberg model. Spin-wave spectrum is also calculated, where the
calculated spin gap of $10.4$ meV can in principle be measured by future
inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Finally we emphasize that our
proposal is consistent with all known experimental evidence, including the most
relevant resonant x-ray magnetic scattering measurements [X. Liu \emph{et al.}

in circular orbits, the emitted radiation has a frequency that is twice the
orbital frequency. Systems in eccentric orbits, however, emit gravitational
radiation in the higher harmonics too. In this paper, we are concerned with the
stochastic background of gravitational waves generated by double neutron star
systems of cosmological origin in eccentric orbits. We consider in particular
the long-lived systems, that is, those binaries for which the time to
coalescence is longer than the Hubble time ($\sim 10$Gyr). Thus, we consider
double neutron stars with orbital frequencies ranging from $10^{-8}$ to
$2\times 10^{-6}$Hz. Although in the literature some papers consider the
spectra generated by eccentric binaries, there is still space for alternative
approaches for the calculation of the backgrounds. In this paper, we use a
method that consists in summing the spectra that would be generated by each
harmonic separately in order to obtain the total background. This method allows
us to clearly obtain the influence of each harmonic on the spectra. In
addition, we consider different distribution functions for the eccentricities
in order to investigate their effects on the background of gravitational waves
generated. At last, we briefly discuss the detectability of this background by
space-based gravitational wave antennas and pulsar timing arrays.

reminiscent of an Einstein-Weyl structure. If, moreover, the electromagnetic

Przanowski-Tod class of metrics, namely a pseudo-hermitian spacetime determined
by solutions of the continuous Toda equation, conformal to a scalar-flat

imaging. Through Villanova's guaranteed access to ground-based telescopes, we
have secured well-covered light curves as regularly as possible. Amplitudes and
times of max brightness were obtained and compared to previous literature
results. At UV wavelengths, we have secured hi-res spectra of 2 nearby Cepheids
- delta Cep and beta Dor - with HST-COS. Also, we have obtained X-ray images of
5 Cepheids with XMM-Newton and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and further
observations with both satellites have been proposed for (XMM) and approved
(Chandra).
  Optical photometry has shown that 8 of the 10 observed Cepheids have
amplitude variability, or hints thereof, and all 10 show period variability
(recent, long-term or possibly periodic). The UV spectra reveal emission lines
from heated atmospheric plasmas of 10^4 - 10^5 K that vary in phase with the
Cepheid pulsations. The X-ray images have detected the three nearest Cepheids
observed (Polaris, delta Cep and beta Dor), while the distances of the other
two place their fluxes likely at or below detector background levels. The X-ray
fluxes for delta Cep show possible phased variability, but anti-correlated with
the UV emission lines (i.e. high X-ray flux during low UV flux, and vice
versa).
  Further data are required to ultimately confirm Blazhko-like cycles in
Cepheids, X-ray variability with phase and the particulars of the high-energy
variability such as phase-lags between atmospheric plasma emissions of
different temperature and the exact contributions of the possible heating
mechanism.

inferring gene functions. Here we seek to improve function prediction by
integrating diffusion-based methods with a novel dimensionality reduction
technique to overcome the incomplete and noisy nature of network data. In this
paper, we introduce diffusion component analysis (DCA), a framework that plugs
in a diffusion model and learns a low-dimensional vector representation of each
node to encode the topological properties of a network. As a proof of concept,
we demonstrate DCA's substantial improvement over state-of-the-art
diffusion-based approaches in predicting protein function from molecular
interaction networks. Moreover, our DCA framework can integrate multiple
networks from heterogeneous sources, consisting of genomic information,
biochemical experiments and other resources, to even further improve function
prediction. Yet another layer of performance gain is achieved by integrating
the DCA framework with support vector machines that take our node vector
representations as features. Overall, our DCA framework provides a novel
representation of nodes in a network that can be used as a plug-in architecture
to other machine learning algorithms to decipher topological properties of and
obtain novel insights into interactomes.

presence of salt, has received much less attention than the growth of snow
crystals from the vapour phase. The growth of so-called frazil ice by
solidification of a supercooled aqueous salt solution is consistent with
crystal growth in the basal plane being limited by the diffusive removal of the
latent heat of solidification from the solid--liquid interface, while being
limited by attachment kinetics in the perpendicular direction. This leads to
the formation of approximately disk-shaped crystals with a low aspect ratio of
thickness compared to radius, because radial growth is much faster than axial
growth. We calculate numerically how fast disk-shaped crystals grow in both
pure and binary melts, accounting for the comparatively slow axial growth, the
effect of dissolved solute in the fluid phase and the difference in thermal
properties between solid and fluid phases. We identify the main physical
mechanisms that control crystal growth and show that the diffusive removal of
both the latent heat released and also the salt rejected at the growing
interface are significant. Our calculations demonstrate that certain previous
parameterizations, based on scaling arguments, substantially underestimate
crystal growth rates by a factor of order 10-100 for low aspect ratio disks,
and provide a parameterization for use in models of ice crystal growth in
environmental settings.

Carlo (QMC) integration. QMC integration of a function
$f\colon[0,1)^s\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by a finite point set
$\mathcal{P}\subset [0,1)^s$ is the approximation of the integral
$I(f):=\int_{[0,1)^s}f(\mathbf{x})\,d\mathbf{x}$ by the average
$I_{\mathcal{P}}(f):=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{P}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x} \in
\mathcal{P}}f(\mathbf{x})$. We treat a certain class of point sets
$\mathcal{P}$ called digital nets. A Koksma-Hlawka type inequality is an
inequality bounding the integration error
$\text{Err}(f;\mathcal{P}):=I(f)-I_{\mathcal{P}}(f)$ by a bound of the form
$|\text{Err}(f;\mathcal{P})|\le C\cdot \|f\|\cdot D(\mathcal{P})$. We can
obtain a Koksma-Hlawka type inequality by estimating bounds on
$|\hat{f}(\mathbf{k})|$, where $\hat{f}(\mathbf{k})$ is a generalized Fourier
coefficient with respect to the Walsh system. In this paper we prove bounds on
Walsh coefficients $\hat{f}(\mathbf{k})$ by introducing an operator called
`dyadic difference' $\partial_{i,n}$. By converting dyadic differences
$\partial_{i,n}$ to derivatives $\frac{\partial }{\partial x_i}$, we get a new
bound on $|\hat{f}(\mathbf{k})|$ for a function $f$ whose mixed partial
derivatives up to order $\alpha$ in each variable are continuous. This new
bound is smaller than the known bound on $|\hat{f}(\mathbf{k})|$ under some
condition. The new Koksma-Hlawka inequality is derived using this new bound on
the Walsh coefficients.

neutron radiation could be liable of a wrong radiocarbon dating, while proton
radiation could be responsible of the Shroud body image formation. On the other
hand, no plausible physical reason has been proposed so far to explain the
radiation source origin, and its effects on the linen fibres. However, some
recent studies, carried out by the first author and his Team at the Laboratory
of Fracture Mechanics of the Politecnico di Torino, found that it is possible
to generate neutron emissions from very brittle rock specimens in compression
through piezonuclear fission reactions. Analogously, neutron flux increments,
in correspondence to seismic activity, should be a result of the same
reactions. A group of Russian scientists measured a neutron flux exceeding the
background level by three orders of magnitude in correspondence to rather
appreciable earthquakes (4th degree in Richter Scale). The authors consider the
possibility that neutron emissions by earthquakes could have induced the image
formation on Shroud linen fibres, trough thermal neutron capture by Nitrogen
nuclei, and provided a wrong radiocarbon dating due to an increment in
C(14,6)content. Let us consider that, although the calculated integral flux of
10^13 neutrons per square centimetre is 10 times greater than the cancer
therapy dose, nevertheless it is100 times smaller than the lethal dose.

data with potential misidentifications. In this framework, the observed vector
of counts, $y$, is considered as a linear function of a vector of latent
counts, $x$, such that $y = A x$, with $x$ assumed to follow a multinomial
distribution conditional on the model parameters, $\theta$. Bayesian methods
are then applied by sampling from the joint posterior distribution of both $x$
and $\theta$. In particular, Link et al. (2010) propose a Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm to sample from the full conditional distribution of $x$, where new
proposals are generated by sequentially adding elements from a basis of the
null space (kernel) of $A$. We consider this algorithm and show that using
elements from a simple basis for the kernel of $A$ may not produce an
irreducible Markov chain. Instead, we require a Markov basis, as defined by
Diaconis and Sturmfels (1998). We illustrate the importance of Markov bases
with three capture-recapture examples. We prove that a specific lattice basis
is a Markov basis for a class of models including the original model considered
by Link et al. (2010) and confirm that the specific basis used by Link et al.
(2010) for their example with two sampling occasions is a Markov basis. The
constructive nature of our proof provides an immediate method to obtain a
Markov basis for any model in this class.
