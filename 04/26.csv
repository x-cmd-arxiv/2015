  Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the sum degrees of freedom (DoF) of interference channels with
hybrid beam-forming in which hybrid beam-forming composed of analog and digital
precodings is employed at each node. For the two-user case, we completely
characterize the sum DoF for an arbitrary number of antennas and RF chains by
developing an achievable scheme optimized for the hybrid beam-forming structure
and deriving its matching upper bound. For a general K-user case, we focus on a
symmetric case and obtain lower and upper bounds on the sum DoF, which are
tight for certain cases. The results show that hybrid beam-forming can increase
the sum DoF of interference channel under certain conditions while it cannot
improve the sum DoFs of point-to-point channel, multiple access channel, and
broadcast channel. The key insights on this gain is that hybrid beam-forming
enables users to manage inter user interference better, and thus each user can
increase the dimension of interference-free signal space for its own desired
signals.

introduced by van Benthem. The original definition of the game is inherently
finite and therefore does not allow one to model infinite processes. We propose
an extension of the sabotage games in which the first player (Runner) traverses
an arena with dynamic weights determined by the second player (Saboteur). In
our model of quantitative sabotage games, Saboteur is now given a budget that
he can distribute amongst the edges of the graph, whilst Runner attempts to
minimise the quantity of budget witnessed while completing his task. We show
that, on the one hand, for most of the classical cost functions considered in
the literature, the problem of determining if Runner has a strategy to ensure a
cost below some threshold is EXPTIME-complete. On the other hand, if the budget
of Saboteur is fixed a priori, then the problem is in PTIME for most cost
functions. Finally, we show that restricting the dynamics of the game also
leads to better complexity.

evaluate the performance of the end-to-end (e2e) transmission. This paper
assumes imperfect channel state information is available at the relay and
designs a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) filter to mitigate the interference.
Subsequently, we adopt zero-forcing (ZF) filters for both detection and
beamforming. The performance of such system is evaluated in terms of bit error
rate (BER) at both relay and destinations, and an optimal choice for the
transmission power at the relay is shown. We then propose a complexity
efficient optimal power allocation (OPA) algorithm that, using the channel
statistics, computes the minimum power that satisfies the rate constraints of
each pair. The results obtained via simulation show that when both MMSE

attained.

relaxed region in order to be correctly detected. Moreover, a weighted
maximization of the minimum SNR among all users is studied taking into account
the relaxed detection region. Symbol error rate analysis (SER) for the proposed
precoding is discussed to characterize the tradeoff between transmit power
reduction and SER increase due to the relaxation. Based on this tradeoff, the
energy efficiency performance of the proposed technique is analyzed. Finally,
extensive numerical results show that the proposed schemes outperform other

several prototypical quantum optical systems where it is found that iterative

relaxations for the AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem. These three
relaxations are incomparable to each other and two of them are incomparable to
the standard SDP relaxation of OPF. Extensive computational experiments show
that these relaxations have numerous advantages over existing convex
relaxations in the literature: (i) their solution quality is extremely close to
that of the SDP relaxations (the best one is within 99.96% of the SDP
relaxation on average for all the IEEE test cases) and consistently outperforms
previously proposed convex quadratic relaxations of the OPF problem, (ii) the
solutions from the strong SOCP relaxations can be directly used as a warm start
in a local solver such as IPOPT to obtain a high quality feasible OPF solution,
and (iii) in terms of computation times, the strong SOCP relaxations can be
solved an order of magnitude faster than standard SDP relaxations. For example,
one of the proposed SOCP relaxations together with IPOPT produces a feasible
solution for the largest instance in the IEEE test cases (the 3375-bus system)
and also certifies that this solution is within 0.13% of global optimality, all
this computed within 157.20 seconds on a modest personal computer. Overall, the
proposed strong SOCP relaxations provide a practical approach to obtain
feasible OPF solutions with extremely good quality within a time framework that
is compatible with the real-time operation in the current industry practice.

The proof starts by considering a general configuration at the mesoscopic
scale, where the dislocations are discrete line defects (points in the
two-dimensional description used here) and the displacement field can be
considered continuous everywhere in the domain except at the slip surfaces,
over which there is a displacement jump. At such scale, as previously shown by
two of the authors, there exists unique physically-based definitions of the
total deformation tensor $\mathbf{F}$ and the elastic and plastic tensors
$\mathbf{F}^e$ and $\mathbf{F}^p$ that do not require the consideration of any
non-realizable intermediate configuration and do not assume any a priori
relation between them of the form $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}^e\mathbf{F}^p$. This
mesoscopic description is then passed to the continuum limit via homogenization
i.e., by increasing the number of slip surfaces to infinity and reducing the
lattice parameter to zero. We show for two-dimensional deformations of
initially perfect single crystals that the classical continuum formulation is
recovered in the limit with $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}^e\mathbf{F}^p$, $\det

X_0$ has only $O(n^{1-\delta})$ nonzeros per column for any constant $\delta
\in (0, 1)$.
  Our algorithmic pipeline centers around solving a certain nonconvex
optimization problem with a spherical constraint, and hence is naturally
phrased in the language of manifold optimization. To show this apparently hard
problem is tractable, we first provide a geometric characterization of the
high-dimensional objective landscape, which shows that with high probability
there are no ""spurious"" local minima. This particular geometric structure
allows us to design a Riemannian trust region algorithm over the sphere that
provably converges to one local minimizer with an arbitrary initialization,
despite the presence of saddle points. The geometric approach we develop here
may also shed light on other problems arising from nonconvex recovery of
structured signals.

  Assessment",,,,,"cs.MM cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The state-of-the-art pooling strategies for perceptual image quality
assessment (IQA) are based on the mean and the weighted mean. They are robust
pooling strategies which usually provide a moderate to high performance for
different IQAs. Recently, standard deviation (SD) pooling was also proposed.
Although, this deviation pooling provides a very high performance for a few
IQAs, its performance is lower than mean poolings for many other IQAs. In this
paper, we propose to use the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and show that it is
a more robust and accurate pooling strategy for a wider range of IQAs. In fact,
MAD pooling has the advantages of both mean pooling and SD pooling. The joint
computation and use of the MAD and SD pooling strategies is also considered in
this paper. Experimental results provide useful information on the choice of
the proper deviation pooling strategy for different IQA models.

described by the Kerr solution, but an observational confirmation is still
missing. Today, the continuum-fitting method and the analysis of the iron
K$\alpha$ line cannot unambiguously test the Kerr paradigm because of the
degeneracy among the parameters of the system, in the sense that it is
impossible with current X-ray data to distinguish a Kerr black hole from a
non-Kerr object with different values of the model parameters. In this paper,
we study the possibility of testing the Kerr nature of black hole candidates
with X-ray spectropolarimetric measurements. Within our simplified model that
does not include the effect of returning radiation, we find that it is
impossible to test the Kerr metric and the problem is still the strong
correlation between the spin and possible deviations from the Kerr geometry.
Moreover, the correlation is very similar to that of other two techniques,
which makes the combination of different measurements not very helpful.
Nevertheless, our results cannot be taken as conclusive and, in order to arrive
at a final answer, the effect of returning radiation should be properly taken
into account.

precise structure of a financial market based, for example, on empirical
findings. With the attached stochastic framework it is further possible to
study how an arbitrary network structure and its expected counterparty credit
risk are analytically related to each other. This allows us, for the first
time, to model the precise structure of an arbitrary financial market and to
derive the corresponding expected exposure in a closed-form expression. It
further enables us to draw implications for the study of systemic risk. We
apply the powerful theory of characteristic functions and Hilbert transforms.
The latter concept is used to express the characteristic function (c.f.) of the
random variable (r.v.) $\max(Y, 0)$ in terms of the c.f. of the r.v. $Y$. The
present paper applies this concept for the first time in mathematical finance.
We then characterise Eulerian digraphs as distinguished exposure structures and
show that considering the precise network structures is crucial for the study
of systemic risk. The introduced network model is then applied to study the
features of an over-the-counter and a centrally cleared market. We also give a
more general answer to the question of whether it is more advantageous for the
overall counterparty credit risk to clear via a central counterparty or
classically bilateral between the two involved counterparties. We then show
that the exact market structure is a crucial factor in answering the raised
question.

the complexity due to node mobility. Most of the existing techniques for

all nodes (unknown nodes as well as anchor nodes) are mobile. Localization in
DRLMSN is done at discrete time intervals called checkpoints. Unknown nodes are
localized for the first time using three anchor nodes. For their subsequent
localizations, only two anchor nodes are used. The proposed technique estimates
two possible locations of a node Using Bezouts theorem. A dead reckoning

frequencies for an entangled system if the measurements of both subsystems are
performed in spatially separated events. This ambiguity gives way to unphysical
consequences: the projection rule could be applied in one or the other
temporal(?) order of measurements (being non local in any case), but symmetry
of the roles of both subsystems would be broken.
  An alternative theory is presented in which this ambiguity does not exist.
Observable relative frequencies differ from those of orthodox Quantum
Mechanics, and a {\it gendaken} experiment is proposed to falsify one or the
other theory. In the alternative theory, each subsystem has an individual state
in its own Hilbert space, and the total system state is direct product (rank
one) of both, so there is no entanglement. Correlation between subsystems
appears through a hidden label that prescribes the output of arbitrary
hypothetical measurements. Measurement is treated as a usual reversible
interaction, and this postulate allows to determine relative frequencies when
the value of a magnitude is known without in any way perturbing the system, by
measurement of the correlated companion.
  It is predicted the existence of an accompanying system, the de Broglie wave,
introduced in order to preserve the action reaction principle in indirect
measurements, when there is no interaction of detector and particle. Some
action on the detector, different from the one cause by a particle, should be
observable.

that the radial pressure inside the anisotropic star is a superposition of
pressure in an isotropic case plus a Gaussian perturbation term. Considering a
proportionality between electric charge density and the density of matter, we
solve the TOV equation for different cases numerically. Our results indicate
that anisotropy increases the maximum mass $M_{max}$ and also its corresponding
radius $R$ for a typical strange quark star. According to our calculations, an
anisotropy amplitude of $A=3\times10^{33}Nm^{-2}$ with a standard deviation of
$\sigma=3\times10^{3}m$ leads to a neutron star of 1.97$M_{\odot}$.
Furthermore, electric charge not only increases the maximum mass and its
corresponding radius, but also raises up the anisotropy factor. We can see that
the tangential pressure $p_{t}$ and anisotropy factor $\Delta$ unlike the
radial pressure $p_{r}$ have a maximum on the surface and this maximum
increases by adding electric charge effect. However, we show that anisotropy
can be more effective than electric charge in rasing maximum mass of strange

over a set $A$, we consider various types of monochromatic factorizations of
right sided infinite words $x\in A^\omega$. Some stronger versions of the usual
notion of monochromatic factorization are introduced. A factorization is called
sequentially monochromatic when concatenations of consecutive blocks are
monochromatic. A sequentially monochromatic factorization is called ultra
monochromatic if any concatenation of arbitrary permuted blocks of the
factorization has the same color of the single blocks.
  We establish links, and in some cases equivalences, between the existence of
these factorizations and fundamental results in Ramsey theory including the
infinite Ramsey theorem, Hindman's finite sums theorem, partition regularity of
IP sets and the Milliken-Taylor theorem. We prove that for each finite set $A$

$x\in A^\omega,$ there exists $y$ in the subshift generated by $x$ admitting a
$\varphi$-ultra monochromatic factorization, where ""almost all"" refers to the

Many stimulating analogies exist with other wave phenomena such as sound and
seismology, X-rays, neutrons. The field has a rich history, which has led to
many applications in lighting, novel lasers, light harvesting, microscopy, and
bio optics. We provide a brief overview of complex photonic media with
different classes of spatial order, varying from completely random to
long-periodically ordered structures, quasi crystalline and aperiodic
structures, and arrays of cavities. In addition to shaping optical waves by
suitable photonic nanostructures, the realization is quickly arising that the
spatial shaping of optical wavefronts with spatial light modulators
dramatically increases the number of control parameters. As a result, it is
becoming possible for instance to literally see through completely opaque
complex media. We discuss a unified view of complex photonic media by means of
a photonic interaction strength parameter. This parameter gauges the
interaction of light with any complex photonic medium, and allows to compare
complex media from different classes for similar applications.

nonlinear} equations in finite dimensions. We take inspiration from the problem
of finding a sparse vector solution by using greedy algorithms based on
iterative residual minimizations in the $\ell_p$-norm, for $1 \leq p \leq 2$.
Due to the mild smoothness of the problem, especially for $p \to 1$, we develop
and analyze a generalized version of Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares
(IRLS). This simple and efficient algorithm performs the solution of
optimization problems involving non-quadratic possibly non-convex and
non-smooth cost functions, which can be transformed into a sequence of common
least squares problems, which can be tackled more efficiently.While its
analysis has been developed in many contexts when the model equation is {\it
linear}, no results are provided in the {\it nonlinear} case. We address the
convergence and the rate of error decay of IRLS for nonlinear problems. The
convergence analysis is based on its reformulation as an alternating
minimization of an energy functional, whose variables are the competitors to
solutions of the intermediate reweighted least squares problems. Under specific
conditions of coercivity and local convexity, we are able to show convergence
of IRLS to minimizers of the nonlinear residual problem. For the case where we
are lacking local convexity, we propose an appropriate convexification.. To
illustrate the theoretical results we conclude the paper with several numerical
experiments. We compare IRLS with standard Matlab functions for an easily
presentable example and numerically validate our theoretical results in the
more complicated framework of phase retrieval problems. Finally we examine the
recovery capability of the algorithm in the context of data corrupted by
impulsive noise where the sparsification of the residual is desired.

concerning explanation of their behavior and possibility of realization. In
this acticle we show that a colossal magnetoresistance is realized in the state
of the topological Kondo insulator, that is similar to the Kondo insulator
state in the Kondo lattice. The mechanism of the phenomenon is the following:
in the spin gapless phase an external magnetic field induces the gap in the
spectrum of spin excitations, the gap in the spectrum of fermions is opened due
to a hybridization between spin and fermion subsystems at half filling, as the
result the magnetic field leads to metal-insulator (or bad metal - insulator)
phase transition. A model of the topological Kondo lattice defined on a
honeycomb lattice is studied for the case when spinless fermion bands are half
filled. It is shown that the hybridization between local moments and itinerant
fermions should be understood as the hybridization between corresponding
Majorana fermions of the spin and charge sectors. The system is a topological
insulator, single fermion and spin excitations at low energies are massive. We
will show that a spin gap induces a gap in the charge channel, it leads to an
appearance of a topological insulator state with chiral gapless edge modes and
the Chern number one or two depending on the exchange integrals' values. The
relevance of this to the traditional Kondo insulator state is discussed.

emerging from buried, compact (r<17-70 pc) nuclei that have very high implied
mid-infrared surface brightness $>$$5\times 10^{13}$ L$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-2}$.
These nuclei are likely powered by accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
and/or hot (>200 K) extreme starbursts. Vibrational, $\nu_2$=1, lines of HCN
are excited by intense 14 micron mid-infrared emission and are excellent probes
of the dynamics, masses, and physical conditions of (U)LIRG nuclei when H$_2$
column densities exceed $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. It is clear that these lines open
up a new interesting avenue to gain access to the most obscured AGNs and
starbursts. Vibrationally excited HCN acts as a proxy for the absorbed
mid-infrared emission from the embedded nuclei, which allows for reconstruction
of the intrinsic, hotter dust SED. In contrast, we show strong evidence that
the ground vibrational state ($\nu$=0), J=3-2 and 4-3 rotational lines of HCN
and HCO$^+$ fail to probe the highly enshrouded, compact nuclear regions owing
to strong self- and continuum absorption. The HCN and HCO$^+$ line profiles are
double-peaked because of the absorption and show evidence of non-circular
motions - possibly in the form of in- or outflows. Detections of vibrationally
excited HCN in external galaxies are so far limited to ULIRGs and early-type
spiral LIRGs, and we discuss possible causes for this. We tentatively suggest
that the peak of vibrationally excited HCN emission is connected to a rapid
stage of nuclear growth, before the phase of strong feedback.

focuses on Deep Belief Networks composed of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and

approaches. It also includes related practical recommendations from the
literature on training them. In the second part, initial experiments using some
of the covered methods are performed on two databases. In particular,
experiments are performed on the MNIST hand-written digit dataset and on facial
emotion data from a Kaggle competition. The results are discussed in the
context of results reported in other research papers. An error rate lower than
the best contribution to the Kaggle competition is achieved using an optimized

Countries face both an increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters
due to climate change. And during such events, citizens are turning to social
media platforms for disaster-related communication and information. Social
media improves situational awareness, facilitates dissemination of emergency
information, enables early warning systems, and helps coordinate relief
efforts. Additionally, spatiotemporal distribution of disaster-related messages
helps with real-time monitoring and assessment of the disaster itself. Here we
present a multiscale analysis of Twitter activity before, during, and after
Hurricane Sandy. We examine the online response of 50 metropolitan areas of the
United States and find a strong relationship between proximity to Sandy's path
and hurricane-related social media activity. We show that real and perceived
threats -- together with the physical disaster effects -- are directly
observable through the intensity and composition of Twitter's message stream.
We demonstrate that per-capita Twitter activity strongly correlates with the
per-capita economic damage inflicted by the hurricane. Our findings suggest
that massive online social networks can be used for rapid assessment
(""nowcasting"") of damage caused by a large-scale disaster.

metallic spectral weight. In the paramagnetic tetragonal phase, though, the
$dc$ resistivity anisotropy of strained samples is almost exclusively due to
stress-induced changes in the Drude weight rather than in the scattering rate,
definitively establishing the anisotropy of the Fermi surface parameters as the
primary effect driving the $dc$ transport properties in the electronic nematic

on the infinite-dimensional unitary group U(\infty). That problem consisted in
the decomposition of a certain 4-parameter family of unitary representations,
which replace the nonexisting two-sided regular representation (Olshanski, J.
Funct. Anal., 2003, arXiv:0109193). The required decomposition is governed by
certain probability measures on an infinite-dimensional space \Omega, which is
a dual object to U(\infty). A way to describe those measures is to convert them
into determinantal point processes on the real line, it turned out that their
correlation kernels are computable in explicit form --- they admit a closed
expression in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric function 2-F-1 (Borodin and
Olshanski, Ann. Math., 2005, arXiv:0109194).
  In the present work we describe a (nonevident) q-discretization of the whole
construction. This leads us to a new family of determinantal point processes.
We reveal its connection with an exotic finite system of q-discrete orthogonal
polynomials --- the so-called pseudo big q-Jacobi polynomials. The new point
processes live on a double q-lattice and we show that their correlation kernels
are expressed through the basic hypergeometric function 2-\phi-1.
  A crucial novel ingredient of our approach is an extended version G of the
Gelfand-Tsetlin graph (the conventional graph describes the Gelfand-Tsetlin
branching rule for irreducible representations of unitary groups). We find the
q-boundary of G, thus extending previously known results (Gorin, Adv. Math.,
2012, arXiv:1011.1769).
