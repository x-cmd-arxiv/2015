important role within financial markets. Therefore a mathematical approach to
be able to find interrelations between the price development of two different
financial underlyings is developed in this paper. Computing the differences of
the relative positions of relevant local extrema of two charts, i.e., the local
phase shifts of these underlyings, gives us an empirical distribution on the
unit circle. With the aid of directional statistics such angular distributions
are studied for many pairs of markets. It is shown that there are several very
strongly correlated underlyings in the field of foreign exchange, commodities
and indexes. In some cases one of the two underlyings is significantly ahead
with respect to the relevant local extrema, i.e., there is a phase shift
unequal to zero between these two underlyings.

the most influential nodes (seeds) can be found effectively in a complex
network. There are a number of measures proposed for this purpose, for
instance, high-degree centrality measure reflects the importance of the network
topology and has a reasonable runtime performance to find a set of nodes with
highest degree, but they do not have a satisfactory dissemination potentiality
in the network due to having many common neighbors ($\mbox{CN}^{(1)}$) and
common neighbors of neighbors ($\mbox{CN}^{(2)}$). This flaw holds in other
measures as well. In this paper, we compare high-degree centrality measure with
other well-known measures using ten datasets in order to find a proportion for
the common seeds in the seed sets obtained by them. We, thereof, propose an
improved high-degree centrality measure (named DegreeDistance) and improve it
to enhance accuracy in two phases, FIDD and SIDD, by putting a threshold on the
number of common neighbors of already-selected seed nodes and a non-seed node
which is under investigation to be selected as a seed as well as considering
the influence score of seed nodes directly or through their common neighbors
over the non-seed node. To evaluate the accuracy and runtime performance of
DegreeDistance, FIDD, and SIDD, they are applied to eight large-scale networks
and it finally turns out that SIDD dramatically outperforms other well-known
measures and evinces comparatively more accurate performance in identifying the
most influential nodes.

with a recurrence time of about 1 year. This is by far the fastest recurrence
time scale of any known RNe. Our optical monitoring programme detected the
predicted 2014 outburst of M31N 2008-12a in early October. We immediately
initiated an X-ray/UV monitoring campaign with Swift to study the
multiwavelength evolution of the outburst. We monitored M31N 2008-12a with
daily Swift observations for 20 days after discovery, covering the entire
supersoft X-ray source (SSS) phase. We detected SSS emission around day six
after outburst. The SSS state lasted for approximately two weeks until about
day 19. M31N 2008-12a was a bright X-ray source with a high blackbody
temperature. The X-ray properties of this outburst were very similar to the
2013 eruption. Combined X-ray spectra show a fast rise and decline of the
effective blackbody temperature. The short-term X-ray light curve showed
strong, aperiodic variability which decreased significantly after about day 14.
Overall, the X-ray properties of M31N 2008-12a are consistent with the average
population properties of M 31 novae. The optical and X-ray light curves can be
scaled uniformly to show similar time scales as those of the Galactic RNe U Sco
or RS Oph. The SSS evolution time scales and effective temperatures are
consistent with a high-mass WD. We predict the next outburst of M31N 2008-12a
to occur in autumn 2015.

giant. He also proved that the size of the giant follows a central limit law.
We show that whp the part outside the giant contains at most a few short cycles

acyclic graph (DAG) of a random $k$-out digraph is almost the same as the
digraph with the giant contracted into one vertex. These findings lead to a
new, concise and self-contained proof of Grusho's theorem. This work also

phase transition phenomenon in strong connectivity, the typical distance, and
an extension to simple digraphs.

the critical ideals of trees with depth two and some arithmetical trees

explanation for counterfactuals, on two levels. Quantum Oblivion (QO) is a
fundamental type of quantum interaction that we prove to be the origin of
quantum counterfactuals. It also turns out to underlie several well-known
quantum effects. This phenomenon is discussed in the first part of the article,
yielding some novel predictions. In the second part, a hypothesis is offered
regarding the unique spacetime evolution underlying QO, termed Quantum
Hesitation (QH). The hypothesis invokes advanced actions and interfering weak
values, as derived first by the Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF). Here too,
weak values are argued to underlie the familiar ""strong"" quantum values. With
these, an event that appears to have never occurred can exert causal effects
and then succumb to QO by another time-evolution involving negative weak values
that eliminate them. We conclude with briefly discussing the implications of
these ideas on the nature of time.

not yet been clear. Here we develop a framework, based on algorithmic
information theory, to quantify the extent to which information is preserved
when network motif analysis, graph spectra and spectral sparsification methods
are applied to over twenty different biological and artificial networks. We
find that the spectral sparsification is highly sensitive to high number of
edge deletion, leading to significant inconsistencies, and that graph spectral
methods are the most irregular, capturing algebraic information in a condensed
fashion but largely losing most of the information content of the original
networks. However, the approach shows that network motif analysis excels at
preserving the relative algorithmic information content of a network, hence
validating and generalizing the remarkable fact that despite their inherent
combinatorial possibilities, local regularities preserve information to such an
extent that essential properties are fully recoverable across different
networks to determine their family group to which they belong to (eg genetic vs
social network). Our algorithmic information methodology thus provides a
rigorous framework enabling a fundamental assessment and comparison between
different data dimensionality reduction methods thereby facilitating the
identification and evaluation of the capabilities of old and new methods.

is linked to major galaxy interactions. Our study utilizes a sample of 10,800
spectroscopic galaxy pairs and 97 post-mergers selected from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey with matches to multi-wavelength datasets. The LERG fraction amongst
interacting galaxies is a factor of 3.5 higher than that of a control sample
matched in local galaxy density, redshift and stellar mass. However, the LERG
excess in pairs does not depend on projected separation and remains elevated
out to at least 500 kpc, suggesting that major mergers are not their main
fuelling channel. In order to identify the primary fuelling mechanism of LERGs,
we compile samples of control galaxies that are matched in various host galaxy
and environmental properties. The LERG excess is reduced, but not completely
removed, when halo mass or D4000 are included in the matching parameters.
However, when BOTH M_halo and D4000 are matched, there is no LERG excess and
the 1.4 GHz luminosities (which trace jet mechanical power) are consistent
between the pairs and control. In contrast, the excess of optical and mid-IR
selected AGN in galaxy pairs is unchanged when the additional matching
parameters are implemented. Our results suggest that whilst major interactions
may trigger optically and mid-IR selected AGN, the gas which fuels the LERGs
has two secular origins: one associated with the large scale environment, such
as accretion from the surrounding medium or minor mergers, plus an internal
stellar mechanism, such as winds from evolved stars.

independent random variables, the fraction of real eigenvalues tends to unity
as the number of matrices in the product increases. Here we present numerical
evidence that this phenomenon is robust with respect to the probability
distribution of matrix elements, and is therefore a general property that
merits detailed investigation. Since the elements of the product matrix are no
longer distributed as those of the single matrix nor they remain independent
random variables, we study the role of these two factors in detail. We study
numerically the properties of the Hadamard (or Schur) product of matrices and
also the product of matrices whose entries are independent but have the same
marginal distribution as that of normal products of matrices, and find that
under repeated multiplication, the probability of all eigenvalues to be real
increases in both cases, but saturates to a constant below unity showing that
the correlations amongst the matrix elements are responsible for the approach
to one. To investigate the role of the non-normal nature of the probability
distributions, we present a thorough analytical treatment of the $2 \times 2$
single matrix for several standard distributions. Within the class of smooth
distributions with zero mean and finite variance, our results indicate that the
Gaussian distribution has the maximum probability of real eigenvalues, but the
Cauchy distribution characterised by infinite variance is found to have a
larger probability of real eigenvalues than the normal. We also find that for
the two-dimensional single matrices, the probability of real eigenvalues lies

  Accepted in Advanced in Applied Mathematics",,,,"math.CO math.AC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies critical ideals of graphs with twin vertices, which are
vertices with the same neighbors. A pair of such vertices are called replicated
if they are adjacent, and duplicated, otherwise. Critical ideals of graphs
having twin vertices have good properties and show regular patterns. Given a
graph $G=(V,E)$ and ${\bf d}\in \mathbb{Z}^{|V|}$, let $G^{\bf d}$ be the graph
obtained from $G$ by duplicating ${\bf d}_v$ times or replicating $-{\bf d}_v$
times the vertex $v$ when ${\bf d}_v>0$ or ${\bf d}_v<0$, respectively.
Moreover, given $\delta\in \{0,1,-1\}^{|V|}$, let \[
\mathcal{T}_{\delta}(G)=\{G^{\bf d}: {\bf d}\in \mathbb{Z}^{|V|} \text{ such
that } {\bf d}_v=0 \text{ if and only if }\delta_v=0 \text{ and } {\bf
d}_v\delta_v>0 \text{ otherwise}\} \] be the set of graphs sharing the same
pattern of duplication or replication of vertices. More than one half of the
critical ideals of a graph in $\mathcal{T}_{\delta}(G)$ can be determined by
the critical ideals of $G$. The algebraic co-rank of a graph $G$ is the maximum
integer $i$ such that the $i$-{\it th} critical ideal of $G$ is trivial. We
show that the algebraic co-rank of any graph in $\mathcal{T}_{\delta}(G)$ is
equal to the algebraic co-rank of $G^{\delta}$. For a large enough ${\bf d}\in
\mathbb{Z}^{V(G)}$, we show that the critical ideals of $G^{\bf d}$ have
similar behavior to the critical ideals of the disjoint union of $G$ and some
set $\{K_{n_v}\}_{\{v\in V(G)| d_v<0\}}$ of complete graphs and some set
$\{T_{n_v}\}_{\{v\in V(G) \, |\, {\bf d}_v>0\}}$ of trivial graphs.
Additionally, we pose important conjectures on the distribution of the
algebraic co-rank of the graphs with twins vertices. These conjectures imply
that twin-free graphs have a large algebraic co-rank, meanwhile a graph having
small algebraic co-rank has at least one pair of twin vertices.

full generality, corresponding boundary conditions for the diffusive limit,
described by Usadel theory, have been lacking for interfaces involving strongly
spin-polarized materials, such as e.g. half-metallic ferromagnets. Given the
current intense research in the emerging field of superconducting spintronics,
the formulation of appropriate boundary conditions for the Usadel theory of

scattering phases has been a burning open question. Here we close this gap and
derive the full boundary conditions for quasiclassical Green functions in the
diffusive limit, valid for any value of spin polarization, transmission
probability, and spin mixing angles (spin-dependent scattering phase shifts).
It allows also for complex spin textures across the interface and for channel
off-diagonal scattering (a necessary ingredient when the numbers of channels on
the two sides of the interface differ). As an example we derive expressions for
the proximity effect in diffusive systems involving half-metallic ferromagnets.

for a new beneficial mutation to take over the population. In this situation,
the population only contains copies of one genotype and evolution can be

genotype (improvements or worsenings) depends on the change in fitness.
  We present an initial runtime analysis of SSWM, quantifying its performance
for various parameters and investigating differences to the (1+1)EA. We show
that SSWM can have a moderate advantage over the (1+1)EA at crossing fitness
valleys and study an example where SSWM outperforms the (1+1)EA by taking
advantage of information on the fitness gradient.

forming liquids close to the glass transition singularity of the idealized
mode- coupling theory (MCT) that has been derived from generic MCT-like
theories by applying dynamical field-theory techniques. SBR displays a rich
phenomenology common to most super-cooled liquids. In its simplest version it
naturally explains two prominent features of the dynamical crossover: the
change from a power-law to exponential increase in the structural relaxation
time and the violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation between diffusion and
viscosity. The solution of the model in three dimensions unveils a qualitative
change at the crossover in the structure of dynamical fluctuations from a
regime characterized by power-law increases of their amplitude and size to a
regime dominated by strong Dynamical Heterogeneities: rare regions where
dynamics is relatively much faster than in the rest of the system. While the
relaxation time changes by orders of magnitude, the size of these regions does
not change significantly and actually decreases below the crossover
temperature. SBR cannot sustain too large fluctuations and could fail well
below the crossover temperature. There it could be replaced by non-conventional
activated dynamics characterized by elementary events with intrinsic time and
length scales of an unusual large (but not necessarily increasing) size
(mesoscopic vs. microscopic).

proposed recently (Evolving fuzzy image segmentation EFIS). However, EFIS
suffers from a few limitations when used in practice mainly due to some fixed
parameters. For instance, EFIS depends on auto-detection of the object of
interest for feature calculation, a task that is highly application-dependent.
This shortcoming limits the applicability of EFIS, which was proposed with the
ultimate goal of offering a generic but adjustable segmentation scheme. In this
paper, a new version of EFIS is proposed to overcome these limitations. The new
EFIS, called self-configuring EFIS (SC-EFIS), uses available training data to
self-estimate the parameters that are fixed in EFIS. As well, the proposed
SC-EFIS relies on a feature selection process that does not require
auto-detection of an ROI. The proposed SC-EFIS was evaluated using the same
segmentation algorithms and the same dataset as for EFIS. The results show that
SC-EFIS can provide the same results as EFIS but with a higher level of
automation.

F-theory compactifications is investigated. Such symmetries are shown to arise
from seven-brane configurations in genuine F-theory settings without a weak
string coupling description. Gauge fields on mutually non-local seven-branes
are argued to gauge both R-R and NS-NS two-form bulk axions. The gauging is
completed into a generalisation of the Heisenberg group with either additional
seven-brane gauge fields or R-R bulk gauge fields. The former case relies on
having seven-brane fluxes, while the latter case requires torsion cohomology
and is analysed in detail through the M-theory dual. Remarkably, the M-theory
reduction yields an Abelian theory that becomes non-Abelian when translated
into the correct duality frame to perform the F-theory limit. The reduction
shows that the gauge coupling function depends on the gauged scalars and
transforms non-trivially as required for the groups encountered. This field
dependence agrees with the expectations for the kinetic mixing of seven-branes
and is unchanged if the gaugings are absent.

core, we examined standard 1D and non-standard 3D methods to analyse data of
far-infrared and submillimeter (submm) continuum radiation. The resulting dust
surface density distribution can be compared to that of the gas. The latter was
derived from the analysis of accompanying molecular line emission, observed
with Herschel from space and with APEX from the ground. As a gas tracer we used
N2H+, which is believed to be much less sensitive to freeze-out than CO and its
isotopologues. Radiative transfer modelling of the N2H+(J=3-2) and (J=6-5)
lines with their hyperfine structure explicitly taken into account provides
solutions for the spatial distribution of the column density N(H2), hence the
surface density distribution of the gas. The gas-to-dust mass ratio is varying
across the map, with very low values in the central regions around the core SM
1. The global average, =88, is not far from the canonical value of 100,
however. In rho Oph A, the exponent beta of the power-law description for the
dust opacity exhibits a clear dependence on time, with high values of 2 for the
envelope-dominated emission in starless Class -1 sources to low values close to
0 for the disk-dominated emission in Class III objects. beta assumes
intermediate values for evolutionary classes in between. Since beta is
primarily controlled by grain size, grain growth mostly occurs in circumstellar
disks. The spatial segregation of gas and dust, seen in projection toward the
core centre, probably implies that, like C18O, also N2H+ is frozen onto the
grains.

  added to the introduction",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a nearest-neighbor random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ whose probability
$\omega_x(j)$ to jump to the right from site $x$ depends not only on $x$ but
also on the number of prior visits $j$ to $x$. The collection
$(\omega_x(j))_{x\in\mathbb{Z},n\ge 0}$ is sometimes called the ""cookie
environment"" due to the following informal interpretation. Upon each visit to a
site the walker eats a cookie from the cookie stack at that site and chooses
the transition probabilities according to the ""strength"" of the cookie eaten.
We assume that the cookie stacks are i.i.d. and that the cookie ""strengths""
within the stack $(\omega_x(j))_{j\ge 0}$ at site $x$ follow a finite state
Markov chain. Thus, the environment at each site is dynamic, but it evolves
according to the local time of the walk at each site rather than the original
random walk time.
  The model admits two different regimes, critical or non-critical, depending
on whether the expected probability to jump to the right (or left) under the
invariant measure for the Markov chain is equal to $1/2$ or not. We show that
in the non-critical regime the walk is always transient, has non-zero linear
speed, and satisfies the classical central limit theorem. The critical regime
allows for a much more diverse behavior. We give necessary and sufficient
conditions for recurrence/transience and ballisticity of the walk in the
critical regime as well as a complete characterization of limit laws under the
averaged measure in the transient case.
  The setting considered in this paper generalizes the previously studied model
with periodic cookie stacks. Our results on ballisticity and limit theorems are
new even for the periodic model.

the mass hierarchy, the octant of $\theta_{23}$ and the CP phase $\delta_{CP}$.
It is well known that the presence of hierarchy$-\delta_{CP}$ and octant
degeneracies affects the unambiguous determination of these parameters. In this
paper we show that a comprehensive way to study the remaining parameter
degeneracies is in the form of a generalized hierarchy-$\theta_{23}$ -
$\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy. We show that the wrong-hierarchy and/or wrong-octant
solutions can be further classified into eight different solutions depending on
whether they occur with the wrong or right value of $\delta_{CP}$. These eight
solutions are different from the original eightfold degenerate solutions and
can exist, in principle, even if $\theta_{13}$ is known. These multiple
solutions, apart from affecting the determination of the true hierarchy and
octant, also affect the accurate estimation of $\delta_{CP}$. We identify which
of these eight different degenerate solutions can occur in the test
($\theta_{23} - \delta_{CP}$) parameter space, taking the long-baseline
experiment NO$\nu$A running in the neutrino mode as an example. The inclusion
of the NO$\nu$A antineutrino run removes the wrong-octant solutions appearing
with both right and wrong hierarchy. Adding T2K data to this resolves the wrong
hierarchy -- right octant solutions to a large extent. The remaining wrong
hierarchy solutions can be removed by combining NO$\nu$A + T2K with atmospheric
neutrino data. We demonstrate this using ICAL@INO as the prototype atmospheric
neutrino detector. We find that the degeneracies can be resolved at the
$2\sigma$ level by the combined data set, for the true parameter space
considered in the study.

differences in the clustering of AGN selected at different wavelengths can
therefore be explained by the clustering differences of their host populations,

discuss their prospects in real-space electronic structure calculations. These
methods, based on the low-rank representation of the multidimensional functions
and integral operators, led to entirely grid-based tensor-structured 3D
Hartree-Fock eigenvalue solver. It benefits from tensor calculation of the core
Hamiltonian and two-electron integrals (TEI) in $O(n\log n)$ complexity using
the rank-structured approximation of basis functions, electron densities and
convolution integral operators all represented on 3D $n\times n\times n $
Cartesian grids. The algorithm for calculating TEI tensor in a form of the
Cholesky decomposition is based on multiple factorizations using algebraic 1D
``density fitting`` scheme. The basis functions are not restricted to separable
Gaussians, since the analytical integration is substituted by high-precision
tensor-structured numerical quadratures. The tensor approaches to
post-Hartree-Fock calculations for the MP2 energy correction and for the
Bethe-Salpeter excited states, based on using low-rank factorizations and the
reduced basis method, were recently introduced. Another direction is related to
the recent attempts to develop a tensor-based Hartree-Fock numerical scheme for
finite lattice-structured systems, where one of the numerical challenges is the
summation of electrostatic potentials of a large number of nuclei. The 3D
grid-based tensor method for calculation of a potential sum on a $L\times
L\times L$ lattice manifests the linear in $L$ computational work, $O(L)$,
instead of the usual $O(L^3 \log L)$ scaling by the Ewald-type approaches.

states. Up and down states are typically observed in neuronal networks as a
slow oscillation, where the population switches between high and low firing
rates (Sanchez-Vivez and McCormick, 2000). A neural population model with spike
rate adaptation is used to model such slow oscillations, and the timescale of
adaptation determines the oscillation period. Furthermore, the period depends
non-monotonically on the background tonic input driving the population, having
long periods for very weak and very strong stimuli. Using both linearization
and fast-slow timescale separation methods, we can compute the phase
sensitivity function of the slow oscillation. We find that the phase response
is most strongly impacted by perturbations to the adaptation variable. Phase
sensitivity functions can then be utilized to quantify the impact of noise on
oscillating populations. Noise alters the period of oscillations by speeding up
the rate of transition between the up and down states. When common noise is
presented to two distinct populations, their transitions will eventually become
entrained to one another through stochastic synchrony.

which the U(1)$^\prime$ gauge boson ($Z^\prime$ boson) mass as well as the

investigate a possibility to solve the SM Higgs vacuum instability problem. The

during the assembly of the first structures in the Universe, in particular
during the formation of Pop.~III and supermassive stars. Their subsequent
evolution is expected to be crucial to determine the mass scale of the first
cosmological objects, which depends on the temperature of the gas and the
dominant cooling mechanism. Here, we derive a one-zone framework to explore the
chemical evolution of such disks and show that viscous heating leads to the
collisional dissociation of an initially molecular gas. The effect is relevant
on scales of 10 AU (1000 AU) for a central mass of 10 M_sun (10^4 M_sun) at an
accretion rate of 10^{-1} M_sun yr^{-1}, and provides a substantial heat input
to stabilize the disk. If the gas is initially atomic, it remains atomic during
the further evolution, and the effect of viscous heating is less significant.
The additional thermal support is particularly relevant for the formation of
very massive objects, such as the progenitors of the first supermassive black
holes. The stabilizing impact of viscous heating thus alleviates the need for a
strong radiation background as a means of keeping the gas atomic.

follow the dynamical evolution of the density field inside these initially
spherical LVs from $z=10$ up to $z_{\rm low} = 0.05$, witnessing highly
non-linear, anisotropic mass rearrangements within them, leading to the
emergence of the local cosmic web (CW). These mass arrangements have been
analysed in terms of the reduced inertia tensor $I_{ij}^r$, focusing on the
evolution of the principal axes of inertia and their corresponding
eigendirections, and paying particular attention to the times when the
evolution of these two structural elements declines. In addition, mass and
component effects along this process have also been investigated. We have found
that deformations are led by dark matter dynamics and they transform most of
the initially spherical LVs into prolate shapes, i.e. filamentary structures.
An analysis of the individual freezing-out time distributions for shapes and
eigendirections shows that first most of the LVs fix their three axes of
symmetry (like a skeleton) early on, while accretion flows towards them still
continue. Very remarkably, we have found that more massive LVs fix their
skeleton earlier on than less massive ones. We briefly discuss the
astrophysical implications our findings could have, including the galaxy
mass-morphology relation and the effects on the galaxy-galaxy merger parameter
space, among others.

naturally go through the pre-reheated phase with minimally coupled matter

of column densities, hence, masses of molecular cores from Herschel data. We
first consider several detailed grain models that predict far-IR grain
opacities. Opacities predicted by the models differ by more than a factor of
two, leading to uncertainties in derived column densities by the same factor.
Then we consider uncertainties associated with the modified blackbody fitting
process used by observers to estimate column densities. For high column density
clouds (N(H) $\gg$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$), this fitting technique can
underestimate column densities by about a factor of three. Finally, we consider
the virial stability of the five starless cores in MCLD 123.5+24.9. All of
these cores appear to have strongly sub-virial masses, assuming, as we argue,
that $^{13}$CO line data provide reliable estimates of velocity dispersions.
Evidently, they are not self-gravitating, so it is no surprise that they are
starless.

Santha-Vazirani sources producing cryptographically secure random bits was
proposed; however for reasons of practical relevance, the crucial question
remained open whether this can be accomplished under the minimal conditions
necessary for the task. Namely, is it possible to achieve randomness
amplification using only two no-signaling components and in a situation where
the violation of a Bell inequality only guarantees that some outcomes of the
device for specific inputs exhibit randomness? Here, we solve this question and
present a device-independent protocol for randomness amplification of
Santha-Vazirani sources using a device consisting of two non-signaling
components. We show that the protocol can amplify any such source that is not
fully deterministic into a fully random source while tolerating a constant
noise rate and prove the composable security of the protocol against general
no-signaling adversaries. Our main innovation is the proof that even the
partial randomness certified by the two-party Bell test (a single input-output
pair ($\textbf{u}^*, \textbf{x}^*$) for which the conditional probability
$P(\textbf{x}^* | \textbf{u}^*)$ is bounded away from $1$ for all no-signaling
strategies that optimally violate the Bell inequality) can be used for
amplification. We introduce the methodology of a partial tomographic procedure
on the empirical statistics obtained in the Bell test that ensures that the
outputs constitute a linear min-entropy source of randomness. As a technical
novelty that may be of independent interest, we prove that the Santha-Vazirani
source satisfies an exponential concentration property given by a recently
discovered generalized Chernoff bound.

concept is that natural dynamics quickly arrive at approximations of such
equilibria, even in games with many players. In addition, there exist
polynomial-time algorithms that compute exact (coarse) correlated equilibria.
In light of these results, a natural question is how good are the (coarse)
correlated equilibria that can arise from any efficient algorithm or dynamics.
  In this paper we address this question, and establish strong negative
results. In particular, we show that in multiplayer games that have a succinct
representation, it is NP-hard to compute any coarse correlated equilibrium (or
approximate coarse correlated equilibrium) with welfare strictly better than
the worst possible. The focus on succinct games ensures that the underlying
complexity question is interesting; many multiplayer games of interest are in
fact succinct. Our results imply that, while one can efficiently compute a
coarse correlated equilibrium, one cannot provide any nontrivial welfare
guarantee for the resulting equilibrium, unless P=NP. We show that analogous
hardness results hold for correlated equilibria, and persist under the
egalitarian objective or Pareto optimality.
  To complement the hardness results, we develop an algorithmic framework that
identifies settings in which we can efficiently compute an approximate
correlated equilibrium with near-optimal welfare. We use this framework to
develop an efficient algorithm for computing an approximate correlated
equilibrium with near-optimal welfare in aggregative games.

a year after the explosion. Long-duration GRBs are accompanied by supernovae
(SNe) that typically contain much more energy than the GRB jet. Here we
consider the fact that the SN blast wave will also produce its own afterglow
(supernova remnant emission), which will peak at much later time (since it is
non-relativistic), when the SN blast wave transitions from a coasting phase to
a decelerating Sedov-Taylor phase. We predict that this component will peak
generally a few tens of years after the explosion and it will outshine the GRB
powered afterglow well-before its peak emission. In the case of GRB 030329,
where the external density is constrained by the $\sim 10$-year coverage of the
radio GRB afterglow, the radio emission is predicted to start rising over the

fitted to the data in order to determine the favoured ranges of local density,

have shown that magnetic fields have a central role in massive star formation.
Like in low-mass star formation, the magnetic field in massive young stellar
objects can either be oriented along the outflow axis or randomly. Measuring
the magnetic field at milliarcsecond resolution (10-100 au) around a
substantial number of massive young stellar objects permits determining with a
high statistical significance whether the direction of the magnetic field is
correlated with the orientation of the outflow axis or not. In late 2012, we
started a large VLBI campaign with the European VLBI Network to measure the
linearly and circularly polarized emission of 6.7 GHz methanol masers around a
sample of massive star-forming regions. This paper focuses on the first seven
observed sources, G24.78+0.08, G25.65+1.05, G29.86-0.04, G35.03+0.35,
G37.43+1.51, G174.20-0.08, and G213.70-12.6. For all these sources, molecular
outflows have been detected in the past. We detected a total of 176 methanol
masing cloudlets toward the seven massive star-forming regions, 19% of which
show linearly polarized emission. The methanol masers around the massive young
stellar object MM1 in G174.20-0.08 show neither linearly nor circularly
polarized emission. The linear polarization vectors are well ordered in all the
other massive young stellar objects. We measured significant Zeeman splitting
toward both A1 and A2 in G24.78+0.08, and toward G29.86-0.04 and G213.70-12.6.
By considering all the 19 massive young stellar objects reported in the
literature for which both the orientation of the magnetic field at
milliarcsecond resolution and the orientation of outflow axes are known, we
find evidence that the magnetic field (on scales 10-100 au) is preferentially
oriented along the outflow axes.

stabilizing predictions (SP). The analysis has revealed three elements that are
central to the success of the SP method: (1) bounds on Cohen's Kappa agreement
between successively trained models impose bounds on differences in F-measure
performance of the models; (2) since the stop set does not have to be labeled,
it can be made large in practice, helping to guarantee that the results
transfer to previously unseen streams of examples at test/application time; and
(3) good (low variance) sample estimates of Kappa between successive models can
be obtained. Proofs of relationships between the level of Kappa agreement and
the difference in performance between consecutive models are presented.
Specifically, if the Kappa agreement between two models exceeds a threshold T
(where $T>0$), then the difference in F-measure performance between those
models is bounded above by $\frac{4(1-T)}{T}$ in all cases. If precision of the
positive conjunction of the models is assumed to be $p$, then the bound can be
tightened to $\frac{4(1-T)}{(p+1)T}$.

  in Earth and Planetary Science on April 13, 2015",,,,"astro-ph.SR physics.space-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  This paper presents an overview of results obtained during the CAWSES II
period on the short term variability of the Sun and how it affects the near
Earth space environment. CAWSES II was planned to examine the behavior of the
solar terrestrial system as the solar activity climbed to its maximum phase in
solar cycle 24. After a deep minimum following cycle 23, the Sun climbed to a
very weak maximum in terms of the sunspot number in cycle 24 (MiniMax24), so
many of the results presented here refer to this weak activity in comparison
with cycle 23. The short term variability that has immediate consequence to
Earth and geospace manifests as solar eruptions from closed field regions and
high speed streams from coronal holes. Both electromagnetic (flares) and mass
emissions (coronal mass ejections, CMEs) are involved in solar eruptions, while
coronal holes result in high speed streams that collide with slow wind forming
the so called corotating interaction regions (CIRs). Fast CMEs affect Earth via
leading shocks accelerating energetic particles and creating large geomagnetic
storms. CIRs and their trailing high speed streams (HSSs), on the other hand,
are responsible for recurrent small geomagnetic storms and extended (days) of
auroral zone activity, respectively. The latter lead to the acceleration of
relativistic magnetospheric killer electrons. One of the major consequences of
the weak solar activity is the altered physical state of the heliosphere that
has serious implications for the shock-driving and storm causing properties of
CMEs. Finally, a discussion is presented on extreme space weather events
prompted by the 2012 July 23 super storm event that occurred on the backside of
the Sun. Many of these studies were enabled by the simultaneous availability of
remote-sensing and in situ observations from multiple vantage points with
respect to the Sun Earth line.

embedding some given geometry in a higher dimensional flat one is useful for
understanding the causal structure of classical fields traveling in the former,
in terms of that in the latter. We point out, in the 4D spatially flat FLRW
universe, that the causal structure of transverse-traceless (TT) gravitational
waves can be elucidated by first reducing the problem to a 2D Minkowski wave
equation with a time dependent potential, where the relevant Green's function
is pure tail -- waves produced by a physical source propagate strictly within
the null cone. By viewing this 2D world as embedded in a 4D one, the 2D Green's
function can also be seen to be sourced by a cylindrically symmetric scalar
field in 3D. From both the 2D wave equation as well as the 3D scalar
perspective, we recover the exact solution of the 4D graviton tail, for the
case where the scale factor written in conformal time is a power law. There are
no TT gravitational wave tails when the universe is radiation dominated because
the background Ricci scalar is zero. In a matter dominated one, we estimate the
amplitude of the tail to be suppressed relative to its null counterpart by both
the ratio of the duration of the source to the age of the universe $\eta_0$,
and the ratio of the observer-source spatial distance (at the observer's time)
to the same $\eta_0$. In a universe driven primarily by a cosmological
constant, the tail contribution to the background FLRW geometry after the
source has ceased, is the conformal factor $a^2$ times a spacetime-constant
symmetric matrix proportional to the spacetime volume integral of the TT part
of the source's stress-energy-momentum tensor. In other words, massless spin-2
gravitational waves exhibit a tail-induced memory effect in 4D de Sitter
spacetime.

massless particles with linear energy dispersion. A particularly intriguing
phenomenon arises with the intrinsic charge transport behavior at the Dirac
point where the charge density approaches zero. In graphene, a 2-D Dirac
fermion system, it was predicted that charge transport near the Dirac point is
carried by evanescent modes, resulting in unconventional pseudo-diffusive
charge transport even in the absence of disorder. In the past decade,
experimental observation of this phenomenon remained challenging due to the
presence of strong disorder in graphene devices which limits the accessibility
of the low carrier density regime close enough to the Dirac point. Here we
report transport measurements on ballistic suspended graphene-Niobium Josephson
weak links that demonstrate a transition from ballistic to pseudo-diffusive
like evanescent transport below a carrier density of $(10^{10}
cm^{-2})$.Approaching the Dirac point, the sub-harmonic gap structures due to
multiple Andreev reflections display a strong Fermi energy-dependence and
become increasingly pronounced, while the normalized excess current through the
superconductor-graphene interface decreases sharply. Our observations are in
qualitative agreement with the longstanding theoretical prediction for the
emergence of evanescent transport mediated pseudo-diffusive transport in
graphene.

complexity per iteration is usually cheaper than of the full gradient method
when the number of nodes $N$ in the network is large. We prove that for this
method we obtain in expectation an $\epsilon$-accurate solution in at most
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{N}{\tau \epsilon})$ iterations and thus the convergence rate
depends linearly on the number of (block) components $\tau$ to be updated. For
strongly convex functions the new method converges linearly. We also focus on
how to choose the probabilities to make the randomized algorithm to converge as
fast as possible and we arrive at solving a sparse SDP. Finally, we describe
several applications that fit in our framework, in particular the convex
feasibility problem. Numerically, we show that the parallel coordinate descent
method with $\tau>2$ accelerates on its basic counterpart corresponding to
$\tau=2$.

Such perturbations can originate from massive planets or from encounters with

in a star cluster or in the Galactic field depends on the local stellar
density, the velocity dispersion and the time spend in that environment. By
adopting order of magnitude estimates we argue that the majority of planetary
systems born in open clusters will have a {\em Parking zone}, in which
planetesimals are affected by encounters in their parental star cluster but
remain unperturbed after the star has left the cluster. Objects found in this
range of semi-major axis and eccentricity preserve the memory of the encounter
that last affected their orbits, and they can therefore be used to reconstruct
this encounter. Planetary systems born in a denser environment, such as in a
globular cluster are unlikely to have a Parking zone. We further argue that
some planetary systems may have a {\em Frozen zone}, in which orbits are not
affected either by the more inner massive planets or by external influences.

waves: spin-momentum locking, where the direction of momentum fundamentally
locks the polarization of the wave. We trace the ultimate origin of this
phenomenon to complex dispersion and causality requirements on evanescent
waves. We demonstrate that every case of evanescent waves in total internal
reflection, surface states and optical fibers/waveguides possesses this
intrinsic spin-momentum locking. We also introduce a universal right-handed
triplet consisting of momentum, decay and spin for evanescent waves. We derive
the Stokes parameters for evanescent waves which reveal an intriguing result -
every fast decaying evanescent wave is inherently circularly polarized with its
handedness tied to the direction of propagation. We also show the existence of
a fundamental angle associated with total internal reflection (TIR) such that
propagating waves locally inherit perfect circular polarized characteristics
from the evanescent wave. This circular TIR condition occurs if and only if the
ratio of permittivities of the two dielectric media exceeds the golden ratio.
Our work leads to a unified understanding of this spin-momentum locking in

probability of a binary is as much as $\sim 10\%$ for three giant planet
systems that undergo orbital instability, and after post-capture long-term
tidal evolution, the typical binary separation is 3--5 times the sum of
physical radii of the planets. The binary planets are stable during main
sequence lifetime of solar-type stars, if the stellarcentric semimajor axis of
the binary is larger than 0.3 AU. We show that detecting modulations of transit
light curves is the most promising observational method to detect binary
planets. Since the likely binary separations are comparable to the stellar
diameter, the shape of the transit light curve is different from transit to
transit, depending on the phase of the binary's orbit. The transit durations
and depth for binary planet transits are generally longer and deeper than those
for the single planet case. We point out that binary planets could exist among

accompanied by long GeV flashes. In two GRBs, an optical counterpart of the GeV
flash has been detected. Recent work suggests that the GeV+optical flash is
emitted by the external blast wave from the explosion in a medium loaded with
copious $e^\pm$ pairs. The full light curve of the flash is predicted by a
first-principle radiative transfer simulation and can be tested against
observations. Here we examine a sample of 7 bursts with best GeV+optical data
and test the model. We find that the observed light curves are in agreement
with the theoretical predictions and allow us to measure three parameters for
each burst: the Lorentz factor of the explosion, its isotropic kinetic energy,
and the external density. With one possible exception of GRB 090510 (which is
the only short burst in the sample) the ambient medium is consistent with a
wind from a Wolf-Rayet progenitor. The wind density parameter $A=\rho r^2$
varies in the sample around $10^{11}$g/cm. The initial Lorentz factor of the
blast wave varies from 200 to 540 and correlates with the burst luminosity.
Radiative efficiency of the prompt emission in the sample is between 0.1 and
0.8. For the two bursts with detected optical flash, GRB 120711A and GRB
130427A, we also estimate the magnetization of the external blast wave.
Remarkably, the model reproduces the entire optical light curve of GRB 120711A
(with its sharp peak, fast decay, plateau, and break) as well as the GeV data.
The spectrum of GeV flashes is predicted to extend above 0.1 TeV, where they
can be detected by ground-based Cherenkov telescopes.

theoretical framework, based on atomistic tight-binding theory, to
quantitatively determine the strain and electric field dependent hyperfine

captures the strain effects with an accuracy level of DFT method. Excellent
agreement with the available experimental data sets allow reliable
investigation of the design space of multi-qubit architectures, based on both
strain-only as well as hybrid (strain+field) control of qubits. The benefits of
strain are uncovered by demonstrating that a hybrid control of qubits based on
(001) compressive strain and in-plane (100 or 010) fields results in higher
gate fidelities and/or faster gate operations, for all of the four donor
species considered (P, As, Sb, and Bi). The comparison between different donor
species in strained environments further highlights the trends of hyperfine
shifts, providing predictions where no experimental data exists. Whilst faster
gate operations are realisable with in-plane fields for P, As, and Sb donors,
only for the Bi donor, our calculations predict faster gate response in the
presence of both in-plane and out-of-plane fields, truly benefiting from the
proposed planar field control mechanism of the hyperfine interactions.

and confirm the results with reliable photoluminescence measurements.
Furthermore, we successfully probed the dynamics of excitons and trions in
monolayer phosphorene by controlling the photo-carrier injection in a
relatively low excitation power range. Based on our measured optical gap and
the previously measured electronic energy gap, we determined the exciton
binding energy to be ~0.3 eV for the monolayer phosphorene on SiO2/Si

heterogeneously delayed information about queue lengths and channel states of
all links are available at all the transmitters. In an earlier work (by Reddy
et al. in Queueing Systems, 2012), a throughput optimal scheduling policy
(which we refer to henceforth as the R policy) for this setting was proposed.
We study the R policy, and examine its two drawbacks -- (i) its huge
computational complexity, and (ii) its non-optimal average per-packet queueing
delay. We show that the R policy unnecessarily constrains itself to work with
information that is more delayed than that afforded by the system. We propose a
new policy that fully exploits the commonly available information, thereby
greatly improving upon the computational complexity and the delay performance
of the R policy. We show that our policy is throughput optimal. Our main
contribution in this work is the design of two fast and near-throughput-optimal
policies for this setting, whose explicit throughput and runtime performances
we characterize analytically. While the R policy takes a few milliseconds to
several tens of seconds to compute the schedule once (for varying number of
links in the network), the running times of the proposed
near-throughput-optimal algorithms range from a few microseconds to only a few
hundred microseconds, and are thus suitable for practical implementation in

instructional specificity by comparing two ways of using an analogy to learn a
target physical principle: (i) applying the analogy to the target physical
domain on a Case-by-Case basis and (ii) using the analogy to create a General
Rule in the target physical domain. In the discussion sections of a large,
introductory physics course (N = 231), students who sought a General Rule were
better able to discover and apply a correct physics principle than students who
analyzed the examples Case-by-Case. The difference persisted at a reduced level
after subsequent direct instruction. We argue that students who performed
Case-by-Case analyses are more likely to focus on idiosyncratic
problem-specific features rather than the deep structural features. This study
provides an example of investigating how the specific structure of
instructional materials can be consequential for what is learned.

the $\chi^{(3)}(\omega)$ Kerr nonlinearity. In typical structures this response
is on the order of a few femtoseconds with a fixed frequency response. In
contrast, the effective $\chi^{(3)}$ Kerr nonlinearity in photonic crystal
waveguides (PhCWGs) is largely determined by the geometrical parameters of the
structure and is consequently tunable over a wide range. Here we show
self-steepening based on group-velocity (group-index) modulation for the first
time, giving rise to a new physical mechanism for generating this effect.
Further, we demonstrate that periodic media such as PhCWGS can exhibit
self-steepening coefficients two orders of magnitude larger than typical
systems. At these magnitudes the self-steepening strongly affects the nonlinear
pulse dynamics even for picosecond pulses. Due to interaction with additional
higher-order nonlinearities in the semiconductor materials under consideration,
we employ a generalized nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation numerical model to
describe the impact of self-steepening on the temporal and spectral properties
of the optical pulses in practical systems, including new figures of merit.

and engineering systems. The coupling of subsystems with varying time scales
often results in multirate behavior. During the simulation of highly integrated
circuits, for example, only a few elements underlie changing signals whereas
the major part -- usually up to 80 or even 90 per cent -- remains latent.
Standard integration schemes discretize the entire circuit with a single step
size which is mainly limited by the accuracy requirements of the rapidly

without a significant loss of accuracy. By exploiting the latency of the
system, only a fraction of the equations has to be formulated and solved at a
given time point.
  G\""unther and Rentrop suggest that multirate strategies must be based both on
the numerical information of the integration scheme and on the topology of the
circuit. In this paper, we will introduce a directed graph describing the
interdependency of the underlying system and propose Runge--Kutta methods which
utilize the signal flow of the system in order to identify and exploit inactive

$\sim$ 82,000 K, log g $\sim$ 6.2, and solar N(He)/N(H)). In this work, we aim
at rederiving these secured parameters on the sole basis of high-quality
optical spectra. A first grid of non-LTE line-blanketed model atmospheres,
including metals with the abundances derived from the UV spectrum, does not
give satisfactory results when we apply a standard simultaneous fitting
procedure to the observed H and He lines of our optical spectra. The line
profiles are not finely reproduced and the resulting effective temperatures, in
particular, are too low by $\sim$10,000 K. We next investigate the probable
cause of this failure, that is, the importance of missing opacity sources on
the atmospheric stratification. We compare line profiles computed from models
with artificially boosted metallicities, from solar abundances to 15$\times$
these values. We find that the structural effects saturate for a metallicity of
$\sim$10x solar, and use this to compute a second full grid of models and

far field approximations result in a classical dipole-dipole interaction which
depends on the surface reflectivity and the mean number of photons at the
frequency of the atomic/molecular transition. Finally we present numerical

real-world applications, such as surveying and task routing in social networks,
team formation in collaborative networks and experimental design with

quantified via a submodular utility function. Existing approaches for
submodular optimization, however, require that the set of all nodes that can be

propose a novel model where we start our exploration from an initial node, and
new nodes become visible and available for selection only once one of their
neighbors has been chosen. We then present a general algorithm NetExp for this

and vacuum alignment, the triplet vacuum expectation value is allowed to be of
${\cal O}(10)$ GeV, which leads to the possibility of significant modifications
in the couplings of the SM-like Higgs bosons $h$ with other SM particles. In
this talk given at the HPNP2015 conference held at Toyama University, we review
constraints on the model based on the latest LHC data of the SM-like Higgs
boson, like-sign $W$ boson events, and searches for additional neutral Higgs
bosons. In particular, we concentrate on the parameter space for small mixing
angle $\alpha$ between the two custodial singlets. It is pointed out that
constraints from the non-SM custodial singlet are most constraining and those
from the 5-plet are independent of $\alpha$. While currently there is no
constraint from the 3-plet, we show that its $f \bar f$ and $\gamma\gamma$
channels through the gluon fusion production can be very promising for searches
or constraining in the mass range between 160 GeV and 350 GeV because of its
gauge-phobic property.

common limitations: they are usually system model specific, cannot operate with
arbitrary number of transmit/receive antennas, and cannot serve arbitrary
number of users. Moreover, the beamforming techniques for underlay spectrum
sharing do not consider the interference originating from the incumbent primary
system. This work extends the common underlay sharing model by incorporating
the interference originating from the incumbent system into generic combined
beamforming design that can be applied on interference, broadcast or multiple
access channels. The paper proposes two novel multiuser beamforming algorithms
for user fairness and sum rate maximization, utilizing newly derived convex
optimization problems for transmit and receive beamformers calculation in a
recursive optimization. Both beamforming algorithms provide efficient operation
for the interference, broadcast and multiple access channels, as well as for
arbitrary number of antennas and secondary users in the system. Furthermore,
the paper proposes a successive transmit/receive optimization approach that
reduces the computational complexity of the proposed recursive algorithms. The
results show that the proposed complexity reduction significantly improves the
convergence rates and can facilitate their operation in scenarios which require

carries electrostrictive terms that are explicitly symmetry dependent means
that the standard effective medium parameters cannot give sufficient

interstellar medium. Despite substantial works pointing to their existence,
pre-biotic molecules are yet to be discovered with a complete confidence. In
this paper, our main aim is to study the chemical evolution of interstellar
adenine under various circumstances. We prepare a large gas-grain chemical
network by considering various pathways for the formation of adenine. Majumdar
et al. (2012) proposed that in the absence of adenine detection, one could try
to trace two precursors of adenine, namely, HCCN and NH_2CN. Recently Merz et
al. (2014), proposed another route for the formation of adenine in interstellar
condition. They proposed two more precursor molecules. But it was not verified
by any accurate gas-grain chemical model. Neither was it known if the
production rate would be high or low. Our paper fills this important gap. We
include this new pathways to find that the contribution through this pathways
for the formation of Adenine is the most dominant one in the context of
interstellar medium. We propose that observers may look for the two precursors
(C_3NH and HNCNH) in the interstellar media which are equally important for
predicting abundances of adenine. We perform quantum chemical calculations to
find out spectral properties of adenine and its two new precursor molecules in
infrared, ultraviolet and sub-millimeter region. Our present study would be
useful for predicting abundance of adenine.

the distribution of completion times, upon the binding of a seed molecule at a

indicate that while the probability of completion is greater for random

the formation of grain-surface species. However, since recombination efficiency
of formation of any surface species are heavily dependent on various physical
and chemical parameters, Monte Carlo method would be best method suited to take
care of randomness of the processes. We perform Monte Carlo simulation to study
the formation of $H_2$, $HD$ and $D_2$ on interstellar ices. Adsorption
energies of surface species are the key inputs for the formation of any species

the chemistry on the interstellar dusts. Following some earlier studies, we
consider various sets of adsorption energies to study the formation of these

in these two approaches (Rate equation method and Monte Carlo method) is
observed for production of these simple molecules on interstellar ices. We
introduce two factors, namely, $S_f$ and $\beta$ to explain these
discrepancies: $S_f$ is a scaling factor, which could be used to correlate
discrepancies between Rate equation and Monte Carlo methods. $\beta$ factor
indicates the formation efficiency under various circumstances. Higher values
of $\beta$ indicates a lower production efficiency. We found that $\beta$
increases with a decrease in rate of accretion from gas phase to grain phase.

searching for symmetric extensions of this state was first proposed by Doherty,
Parrilo and Spedialeri. The complete family of separability tests it generates,
often referred to as the hierarchy of $k$-extendibility tests, has already
proved to be most promising. The goal of this paper is to try and quantify the
efficiency of this separability criterion in typical scenarios. For that, we
essentially take two approaches. First, we compute the average width of the set
of $k$-extendible states, in order to see how it scales with the one of
separable states. And second, we characterize when random-induced states are,
depending on the ancilla dimension, with high probability violating or not the
$k$-extendibility test, and compare the obtained result with the corresponding
one for entanglement vs separability. The main results can be precisely phrased
as follows: on $\mathbf{C}^d\otimes\mathbf{C}^d$, when $d$ grows, the average
width of the set of $k$-extendible states is equivalent to $(2/\sqrt{k})/d$,
while random states obtained as partial traces over an environment
$\mathbf{C}^s$ of uniformly distributed pure states are violating the
$k$-extendibility test with probability going to $1$ if $s<((k-1)^2/4k)d^2$.
Both statements converge to the conclusion that, if $k$ is fixed,
$k$-extendibility is asymptotically a weak approximation of separability, even
though any of the other well-studied separability relaxations is outperformed
by $k$-extendibility as soon as $k$ is above a certain (dimension independent)
value.

recovery in the observed galactic cosmic ray intensity. We seek to understand
the relationship between the FDs and near-Earth interplanetary magnetic field

Methods. We use muon data at cutoff rigidities ranging from 14 to 24 GV from
the GRAPES-3 tracking muon telescope to identify FD events. We select those FD
events that have a reasonably clean profile, and magnitude > 0.25%. We use IMF
data from ACE/WIND spacecrafts. We look for correlations between the FD profile
and that of the one hour averaged IMF. We ask if the diffusion of high energy
protons into the large scale magnetic field is the cause of the lag observed
between the FD and the IMF. Results. The enhancement of the IMF associated with
FDs occurs mainly in the shock-sheath region, and the turbulence level in the
magnetic field is also enhanced in this region. The observed FD profiles look
remarkably similar to the IMF enhancement profiles. The FDs typically lag the
IMF enhancement by a few hours. The lag corresponds to the time taken by high
energy protons to diffuse into the magnetic field enhancement via cross-field
diffusion. Conclusions. Our findings show that high rigidity FDs associated
with CMEs are caused primarily by the cumulative diffusion of protons across
the magnetic field enhancement in the turbulent sheath region between the shock
and the CME.

principle very attractive, but has been hard to use in practice. A novel,
practical model based on GOK-DFT for the calculation of electronic excitation
energies is discussed. The new model relies on two modifications of GOK-DFT:
use of range separation and use of the slope of the linearly-interpolated
ensemble energy, rather than orbital energies. The range-separated approach is
appealing as it enables the rigorous formulation of a multi-determinant
state-averaged DFT method. In the exact theory, the short-range density
functional, that complements the long-range wavefunction-based ensemble energy
contribution, should vary with the ensemble weights even when the density is
held fixed. This weight dependence ensures that the range-separated ensemble
energy varies linearly with the ensemble weights. When the (weight-independent)
ground-state short-range exchange-correlation functional is used in this
context, curvature appears thus leading to an approximate weight-dependent
excitation energy. In order to obtain unambiguous approximate excitation
energies, we propose to interpolate linearly the ensemble energy between
equiensembles. It is shown that such a linear interpolation method (LIM) can be
rationalized and that it effectively introduces weight dependence effects. As
proof of principle, LIM has been applied to He, Be, H$_2$ in both equilibrium
and stretched geometries as well as the stretched HeH$^+$ molecule. Very
promising results have been obtained for both single (including charge
transfer) and double excitations with spin-independent short-range local and
semi-local functionals. Even at the Kohn--Sham ensemble DFT level, that is
recovered when the range-separation parameter is set to zero, LIM performs
better than standard time-dependent DFT.

regions of the equal quality description of data which are located at the
center of mass collision energies 4.4-4.87 GeV and 10.8-12 GeV. At the
collision energies below 4.4 GeV the hadron gas models describe data much
better than the QGP one and, hence, we associate this region with hadron phase.
At the collision energies between 5 GeV and 10.8 GeV and above 12 GeV we found
that QGP models describe data essentially better than the hadron gas ones and,
hence, these regions we associate with the quark-gluon phase. As a result, the
collision energy regions 4.4-4.87 GeV and 10.8-12 GeV we interpret as the
energies of the hadron-quark-gluon mixed phase formation. Based on these
findings we argue that the most probable energy range of the QCD phase diagram
(tri)critical endpoint is 12-14 GeV.

Earlier studies addressed the general operation of graphene-based

charge carrier cooling time, on the order of picoseconds. However, the
generation of the photovoltage could occur at a much faster time scale, as it
is associated with the carrier heating time. Here, we measure the photovoltage
generation time and find it to be faster than 50 femtoseconds. As a
proof-of-principle application of this ultrafast photodetector, we use graphene
to directly measure, electrically, the pulse duration of a sub-50 femtosecond
laser pulse. The observation that carrier heating is ultrafast suggests that
energy from absorbed photons can be efficiently transferred to carrier heat. To
study this, we examine the spectral response and find a constant spectral
responsivity between 500 and 1500 nm. This is consistent with efficient
electron heating. These results are promising for ultrafast femtosecond and

systematically investigated within the separable random-phase-approximation
(SRPA) based on the Skyrme functional. The energies $E_{\gamma}$ and reduced
transition probabilities $B(E2)$ of $2^+_{\gamma}$-states are calculated with
the Skyrme forces SV-bas and SkM$^*$. The energies of two-quasiparticle
configurations forming the SRPA basis are corrected by using the pairing
blocking effect. This results in a systematic downshift of $E_{\gamma}$ by
0.3-0.5 MeV and thus in a better agreement with the experiment, especially in
Sm, Gd, Dy, Hf, and W regions. For other isotopic chains, a noticeable
overestimation of $E_{\gamma}$ and too weak collectivity of
$2^+_{\gamma}$-states still persist. It is shown that domains of nuclei with a
low and high $2^+_{\gamma}$ -collectivity are related with the structure of the
lowest 2-quasiparticle states and conservation of the Nilsson selection rules.
The description of $2^+_{\gamma}$ states with SV-bas and SkM$^*$ is similar in
light rare-earth nuclei but deviates in heavier nuclei. However SV-bas much
better reproduces the quadrupole deformation and energy of the isoscalar giant
quadrupole resonance. The accuracy of SRPA is justified by comparison with
exact RPA. The calculations suggest that a further development of the
self-consistent calculation schemes is needed for a systematic satisfactory
description of the $2^+_{\gamma}$ states.

simulations of stable spherical systems and distinguish two separate types of
relaxation: energy diffusion that is largely independent of particle mass, and
energy exchange between particles of differing masses. While diffusion is
generally regarded as a Fokker-Planck process, it can equivalently be viewed as
the consequence of collective oscillations that are driven by shot noise.
Empirical diffusion rates scale as N^{-1} in inhomogeneous models, in agreement
with Fokker-Planck predictions, but collective effects cause relaxation to
scale more nearly as N^{-1/2} in the special case of a uniform sphere. I use
four different methods to compute the gravitational field, and a 100-fold range
in the numbers of particles in each case. I find the rate at which energy is
exchanged between particles of differing masses does not depend at all on the
force determination method, but I do find the energy diffusion rate is
marginally lower when a field method is used. The relaxation rate in 3D is
virtually independent of the method used because it is dominated by distant
encounters; any method to estimate the gravitational field that correctly
captures the contributions from distant particles must also capture their
statistical fluctuations and the collective modes they drive.

1963. We show that this simple policy is asymptotically optimal. Specifically,
we show that alternating-up-down replacement selection is 2-competitive and no

first few cumulants (or moments) of the distribution of particle diffusion
constants. Frisken (2001 Applied Optics 40, 4087) has pointed out that, despite
greater computational complexity, a non-linear, iterative, analysis of the data
has advantages over the linear least-squares analysis used originally. In order
to explore further the potential and limitations of cumulant methods we
analyse, by both linear and non-linear methods, computer-generated data with
realistic `noise', where the parameters of the distribution can be set
explicitly. We find that, with modern computers, non-linear analysis is
straightforward and robust. The mean and variance of the distribution of
diffusion constants can be obtained quite accurately for distributions of width
(standard deviation/mean) up to about 0.6, but there appears to be little
prospect of obtaining meaningful higher moments.

hand with collection of information on biomarkers and other internal
time-dependent covariates. However, there are tools to incorporate information
from repeated measurements in a useful manner that can help to shed more light

model for mediation analysis in the presence of a time-to-event outcome and
time-dependent covariates to investigate direct and indirect effects in a study
of different lipid lowering treatments in patients with previous myocardial
infarctions. Further, we address the question whether survival in itself may
produce associations between the treatment and the mediator in dynamic path
analysis and give an argument that, due to linearity of the assumed additive
hazard model, this is not the case. We further elaborate on our view that, when
studying mediation, we are actually dealing with underlying processes rather
than single variables measured only once during the study period. This becomes
apparent in results from various models applied to the study of lipid lowering

clearly observe, that discarding information on repeated measurements can lead

also not well understood. In this paper, we study voids in an N-body
simulation, using the ZOBOV watershed algorithm. As in other studies, we use
sets of subsampled dark matter particles as tracers to identify voids, but we
use the full-resolution simulation output to measure dark matter densities at
the identified locations. Voids span a wide range of sizes and densities, but
there is a clear trend towards larger voids containing deeper density minima, a
trend which is expected for all watershed void finders. We also find that the
tracer density at void locations is usually smaller than the true density, and
that this relationship depends on the sampling density of tracers. We show that
fits given in the literature fail to match the observed density profiles of
voids. The average enclosed density contrast within watershed voids varies
widely with both the size of the void and the minimum density within it, but is
always far from the shell crossing threshold expected from theoretical models.
Voids with deeper density minima also show much broader density profiles. We
discuss the implications of these results for the excursion set approach to
modelling such voids.

occupied by the charge carriers under magnetic field is exceptionally large.
This is promising for a quantum Hall resistance standard more practical in
graphene than in the GaAs/AlGaAs devices currently used in national metrology
institutes. Here, we demonstrate that large QHE devices, made of high quality
graphene grown by propane/hydrogen chemical vapour deposition on SiC
substrates, can surpass state-of-the-art GaAs/AlGaAs devices by considerable
margins in their required operational conditions. In particular, in the device
presented here, the Hall resistance is accurately quantized within $1\times
10^{-9}$ over a 10-T wide range of magnetic field with a remarkable lower bound
at 3.5 T, temperatures as high as 10 K, or measurement currents as high as 0.5
mA. These significantly enlarged and relaxed operational conditions, with a
very convenient compromise of 5 T, 5.1 K and 50 $\mu$A, set the superiority of
graphene for this application and for the new generation of versatile and
user-friendly quantum standards, compatible with a broader industrial use. We
also measured an agreement of the quantized Hall resistance in graphene and
GaAs/AlGaAs with an ultimate relative uncertainty of $8.2\times 10^{-11}$. This
supports the universality of the QHE and its theoretical relation to $h$ and
$e$, essential for the application in metrology, particularly in view of the

advantage to studying plasma processes in ultracool dwarfs which are more
similar in gross properties (radius, mass, temperature) to the solar system

prove the isomorphism between the shuffle algebra and the quantum toroidal

  The shuffle algebra viewpoint allows us to construct the universal R-matrix
of the quantum toroidal algebra U_{q,t}(sl_n^^), and to factor it in terms of
pieces that arise from subalgebras isomorphic to quantum affine groups
U_{q}(gl_m^), for various m. This factorization generalizes constructions of
Khoroshkin-Tolstoy to the toroidal case, and matches the factorization that
Maulik-Okounkov produce via the stable basis in the K-theory of Nakajima quiver

generators of U_{q,t}(sl_n^^) acting on the stable basis, which provide a wide

based on information-theoretic principles that demonstrate how to efficiently
transmit long data packets. However, the upcoming wireless systems, notably the
5G system, will need to support novel traffic types that use short packets. For
example, short packets represent the most common form of traffic generated by
sensors and other devices involved in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications.
Furthermore, there are emerging applications in which small packets are
expected to carry critical information that should be received with low latency
and ultra-high reliability.
  Current wireless systems are not designed to support short-packet
transmissions. For example, the design of current systems relies on the
assumption that the metadata (control information) is of negligible size
compared to the actual information payload. Hence, transmitting metadata using
heuristic methods does not affect the overall system performance. However, when
the packets are short, metadata may be of the same size as the payload, and the
conventional methods to transmit it may be highly suboptimal.
  In this article, we review recent advances in information theory, which
provide the theoretical principles that govern the transmission of short
packets. We then apply these principles to three exemplary scenarios (the
two-way channel, the downlink broadcast channel, and the uplink random access
channel), thereby illustrating how the transmission of control information can
be optimized when the packets are short. The insights brought by these examples
suggest that new principles are needed for the design of wireless protocols
supporting short packets. These principles will have a direct impact on the
system design.

interacting homogeneous quantum systems at positive temperatures. Using
Galilean invariance we prove that in one dimension the asymptotic distribution
of P/\sqrt{N} is normal at all temperatures and densities, and in two
dimensions the tail distribution of P/\sqrt{N} is normal. We introduce the
notion of the density matrix reduced to the center of mass, and show that its
eigenvalues are N times the probabilities of the different eigenvalues of \P. A
series of results is presented for the limit of sequences of positive definite
atomic probability measures, relevant for the probability distribution of both
the single-particle and the total momentum. The P=0 ensemble is shown to be
equivalent to the canonical ensemble. Through some conjectures we associate the
properties of the asymptotic distribution of the total momentum with the
characteristics of fluid, solid, and superfluid phases. Our main suggestion is
that in interacting quantum systems above one dimension, in infinite space, the
total momentum is finite with a nonzero probability at all temperatures and
densities. In solids this probability is 1, and in a crystal it is distributed
on a lattice. Since it is less than 1 in two dimensions, we conclude that a 2D
system is always in a fluid phase. For a superfluid we conjecture that the
total momentum is zero with a nonzero probability and otherwise its
distribution is continuous. We define a macroscopic wave function based on the
density matrix reduced to the center of mass. We discuss how dissipation can
give rise to a critical velocity, predict the temperature dependence of the

breakdown in a dissipative flow. We also comment on the relation between

and simulations, then generate mock [CII] intensity maps by applying this
relation to halo catalogs built from large scale N-body simulations. Maps of
the extragalactic far-infrared (FIR) continuum, referred to as ""foreground"",
and CO rotational transition lines and [CI] fine-structure lines referred to as
""contamination"", are produced as well. We find that, at 316 GHz (corresponding
to $z_{\rm CII} = 5$), the mean intensities of the extragalactic FIR continuum,
[CII] signal, all CO lines from $J=1$ to 13 and two [CI] lines are $\sim
3\times10^5$ Jy sr$^{-1}$, $\sim 1200$ Jy sr$^{-1}$, $\sim 800$ Jy sr$^{-1}$

to subtract the FIR continuum foreground by removing a spectrally smooth
component from each line of sight, and to suppress the CO/[CI] contamination by
discarding pixels that are bright in contamination emission. The $z > 5$ [CII]
signal comes mainly from halos in the mass range $10^{11-12} \,M_\odot$; as
this mass range is narrow, intensity mapping is an ideal experiment to

algorithms running on ring networks. In a distributed algorithm, an arbitrary
number of processes cooperate to achieve a common goal (e.g., elect a leader).
Processes have unique identifiers (pids) from an infinite, totally ordered
domain. An algorithm proceeds in synchronous rounds, each round allowing a
process to perform a bounded sequence of actions such as send or receive a pid,
store it in some register, and compare register contents wrt. the associated
total order. An algorithm is supposed to be correct independently of the number
of processes. To specify correctness properties, we introduce a logic that can
reason about processes and pids. Referring to leader election, it may say that,
at the end of an execution, each process stores the maximum pid in some
dedicated register. Since the verification of distributed algorithms is
undecidable, we propose an underapproximation technique, which bounds the
number of rounds. This is an appealing approach, as the number of rounds needed
by a distributed algorithm to conclude is often exponentially smaller than the
number of processes. We provide an automata-theoretic solution, reducing model
checking to emptiness for alternating two-way automata on words. Overall, we
show that round-bounded verification of distributed algorithms over rings is
PSPACE-complete.

In order to address such corruptions, this paper introduces the concept of a
sampling corrector. Such algorithms use structure that the distribution is
purported to have, in order to allow one to make ""on-the-fly"" corrections to
samples drawn from probability distributions. These algorithms then act as
filters between the noisy data and the end user.
  We show connections between sampling correctors, distribution learning
algorithms, and distribution property testing algorithms. We show that these
connections can be utilized to expand the applicability of known distribution
learning and property testing algorithms as well as to achieve improved
algorithms for those tasks.
  As a first step, we show how to design sampling correctors using proper
learning algorithms. We then focus on the question of whether algorithms for
sampling correctors can be more efficient in terms of sample complexity than
learning algorithms for the analogous families of distributions. When
correcting monotonicity, we show that this is indeed the case when also granted
query access to the cumulative distribution function. We also obtain sampling
correctors for monotonicity without this stronger type of access, provided that
the distribution be originally very close to monotone (namely, at a distance
$O(1/\log^2 n)$). In addition to that, we consider a restricted error model
that aims at capturing ""missing data"" corruptions. In this model, we show that
distributions that are close to monotone have sampling correctors that are
significantly more efficient than achievable by the learning approach.
  We also consider the question of whether an additional source of independent
random bits is required by sampling correctors to implement the correction
process.

measures from distant radio sources do not exhibit any trend with redshift,
while the extragalactic contribution instead grows with distance, we constrain
fields with Jeans' length coherence length to be below 1.7~nG at the $2\sigma$
level, and fields coherent across the entire observable Universe below 0.65~nG.
These limits do not depend on the particular origin of these cosmological
fields.

quantum fluctuations in the Universe. In these proposals, the fundamental
""fuzziness"" of distance caused by space-time quantum fluctuations has been
directly identified with fluctuations in optical paths. Phase-front
corrugations deduced from these optical-path fluctuations are then applied to
light from extra-galactic point sources, and used to constrain various models
of quantum gravity. However, when a photon propagates in three spatial
dimensions, it does not follow a specific ray, but rather samples a finite,
three-dimensional region around that ray --- thereby averaging over space-time
quantum fluctuations all through that region. We use a simple, random-walk type
model to demonstrate that, once the appropriate wave optics is applied, the
averaging of neighboring space-time fluctuations will cause much less
distortion to the phase front. In our model, the extra suppression factor due
to diffraction is the wave length in units of the Planck length, which is at
least $10^{29}$ for astronomical observations.

non-linear fields and construction of the perturbation theory with account of
spontaneous symmetry breaking is proposed. The method is based on using as the
main approximation of the relativistic self-consistent field model, in which
the influence of vacuum field fluctuations is taken into account when
constructing the one-particle states. The solutions of the self-consistent
equations determine possible states, which also include the states with broken
symmetries. Different states of the field are matched to particles, whose
masses are determined by both parameters of the Lagrangian and vacuum
fluctuations. The density of the vacuum energy in these states is calculated.
It is shown that the concept of Bogolubov's quasi-averages can naturally be
applied for definition of exact Green functions in the states with broken
symmetries. Equations for exact one- and two-point Green functions are
obtained.
