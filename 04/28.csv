additional exponential disformal term. We conduct cosmological simulations to
discover the impact of the new disformal terms in the matter power spectrum,
halo mass function, and radial profile of the scalar field. We calculated the
disformal geodesic equation and the equation of motion for the scalar field. We
then implemented these equations into the N-body code ISIS, which is a modified
gravity version of the code RAMSES. The presence of a conformal symmetron field
increases both the power spectrum and mass function compared to standard
gravity on small scales. Our main finding is that the newly added disformal
terms tend to counteract these effects and can make the evolution slightly
closer to standard gravity. We finally show that the disformal terms give rise
to oscillations of the scalar field in the centre of the dark matter haloes.

we investigate the widespread analysis of the quantum transport conductance

molecular orbitals (MOs). We first consider two different methods for
identifying the relevant MOs: 1) diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of the
isolated molecule, and 2) diagonalization of a submatrix of the junction
Hamiltonian constructed by considering only basis elements localized on the
molecule. We find that these two methods can lead to substantially different
MOs and hence PDOS. Furthermore, within Method 1, the PDOS can differ depending
on the isolated molecule chosen to represent the molecular junction (e.g.
benzene-dithiol or -dithiolate); and, within Method 2, the PDOS depends on the
chosen basis set. We show that these differences can be critical when the PDOS
is used to provide a physical interpretation of the conductance (especially,
when it has small values as it happens typically at zero bias). In this work,
we propose a new approach trying to reconcile the two traditional methods.
Though some improvements are achieved, the main problems are still unsolved.
Our results raise more general questions and doubts on a PDOS-based analysis of

Recently, many methods have been developed to estimate human pose by using pose
priors that are estimated from physiologically inspired graphical models or
learned from a holistic perspective. In this paper, we propose to integrate
both the local (body) part appearance and the holistic view of each local part
for more accurate human pose estimation. Specifically, the proposed DS-CNN
takes a set of image patches (category-independent object proposals for
training and multi-scale sliding windows for testing) as the input and then
learns the appearance of each local part by considering their holistic views in
the full body. Using DS-CNN, we achieve both joint detection, which determines
whether an image patch contains a body joint, and joint localization, which
finds the exact location of the joint in the image patch. Finally, we develop
an algorithm to combine these joint detection/localization results from all the
image patches for estimating the human pose. The experimental results show the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing to the state-of-the-art
human-pose estimation methods based on pose priors that are estimated from
physiologically inspired graphical models or learned from a holistic

ionizing photons. We find that the properties of the flow are controlled by the
ratio of the recombination time to the flow time-scale. When the recombination
time-scale is short compared to the flow time-scale the the flow is in
approximate local ionization equilibrium with a thin ionization front, where
the photon mean free path is short compared to flow scale. In this
""recombination limited"" flow the mass-loss scales roughly with the square root
of the incident flux. When the recombination time is long compared to the flow
time-scale the ionization front becomes thick and encompasses the entire flow,
with the mass-loss rate scaling linearly with flux. If the planet's potential
is deep the flow is approximately ""energy-limited""; however, if the planet's
potential is shallow we identify a new limiting mass-loss regime, which we term
""photon-limited"". In this scenario the mass-loss rate is purely limited by the
incoming flux of ionizing photons. We have developed a new numerical approach
that takes into account the frequency dependence of the incoming ionizing
spectrum and performed a large suite of 1D simulations to characterise UV
driven mass-loss around low mass planets. We find the flow is
""recombination-limited"" at high fluxes but becomes ""energy-limited"" at low
fluxes; however, the transition is broad occurring over several order of
magnitude in flux. Finally, we point out the transitions between the different
flow types does not occur at a single flux value, but depends on the planet's
properties, with higher mass planets becoming ""energy-limited"" at lower fluxes.

understanding (NLU) errors, the results show that only 61.7\% of the dialog
goals can be successfully obtained in 6.23 dialog turns on average when random
questions are asked by the system, whereas if the proposed DS-states are
updated with the top 5 candidates from the SLU output using the proposed EMDM
strategy executed at every DS-state, then a 86.7\% dialog success rate can be
accomplished effectively within 5.17 dialog turns on average. We also
demonstrate that entropy-based DM strategies are more efficient than
non-entropy based DM. Moreover, using the goal set distributions in EMDM, the
results are better than those without them, such as in sate-of-the-art database

metallic surfaces, where the Rydberg electron energy is degenerate with the
conduction band of the metal, the Cu(100) surface has a projected bandgap at
these energies, and only discrete image states are available through which
charge transfer can take place. Resonant enhancement of charge transfer is
observed at hydrogen principal quantum numbers for which the Rydberg energy
matches the energy of one of the image states. The integrated surface
ionization signals show clear periodicity as the energies of states with
increasing $n$ come in and out of resonance with the image states. The velocity
dependence of the surface ionization dynamics is also investigated. Decreased
velocity of the incident H atom leads to a greater mean distance of ionization
and a lower field required to extract the ion. The surface-ionization profiles
(signal versus applied field) for `on resonance' $n$ values show a changing
shape as the velocity is changed, reflecting the restriction of the resonance
to a certain range of applied field.

galactic processes. The observation that water and hydroxyl megamasers rarely
coexist in the same galaxy has given rise to a hypothesis that the two species
appear in different phases of nuclear activity. The detection of simultaneous
hydroxyl and water megamaser emission toward IC694 has called this hypothesis
into question but, because many megamasers have not been surveyed for emission
in the other molecule, it remains unclear whether IC694 occupies a narrow phase
of galaxy evolution or whether the relationship between megamaser species and
galactic processes is more complicated than previously believed. In this paper,
we present results of a systematic search for 22 GHz water maser emission among
OH megamaser hosts to identify additional objects hosting both megamaser. Our
work roughly doubles the number of galaxies searched for emission in both
molecules which host at least one confirmed maser. We confirm with high degree
of confidence ($> 8 \sigma$) the detection of water emission toward IIZw96,
firmly establishing it as the second object to co-host both water and hydroxyl
megamasers after IC694. We find high luminosity, narrow features in the water
feature in IIZw96. All dual megamaser candidates appear in merging galaxy
systems suggestive that megamaser coexistance may signal a brief phase along
the merger sequence. A statistical analysis of the results of our observations
provide possible evidence for an exclusion of H$_2$O kilomasers among OH

vertical energy transport mediated by thermionic emission of hot carriers
overwhelms electron-lattice cooling as well as lateral diffusive energy

across the entire graphene active area via thermionic emission of hot carriers
into a semiconductor material. Experimental signatures of this regime include a
large and tunable internal responsivity ${\cal R}$ with a non-monotonic
temperature dependence. In particular, ${\cal R}$ peaks at electronic
temperatures on the order of the Schottky potential $\phi$ and has a large
upper limit ${\cal R} \le e/\phi$ ($e/\phi=10\,{\rm A/W}$ when $\phi =

Suppose that a collection of items is repeatedly compared in pairs, and one
wishes to recover a consistent ordering that emphasizes the top-$K$ ranked
items, based on partially revealed preferences. We focus on the
Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model that postulates a set of latent preference
scores underlying all items, where the odds of paired comparisons depend only
on the relative scores of the items involved.
  We characterize the minimax limits on identifiability of top-$K$ ranked
items, in the presence of random and non-adaptive sampling. Our results
highlight a separation measure that quantifies the gap of preference scores
between the $K^{\text{th}}$ and $(K+1)^{\text{th}}$ ranked items. The minimum
sample complexity required for reliable top-$K$ ranking scales inversely with
the separation measure irrespective of other preference distribution metrics.
To approach this minimax limit, we propose a nearly linear-time ranking scheme,
called \emph{Spectral MLE}, that returns the indices of the top-$K$ items in
accordance to a careful score estimate. In a nutshell, Spectral MLE starts with
an initial score estimate with minimal squared loss (obtained via a spectral
method), and then successively refines each component with the assistance of
coordinate-wise MLEs. Encouragingly, Spectral MLE allows perfect top-$K$ item
identification under minimal sample complexity. The practical applicability of
Spectral MLE is further corroborated by numerical experiments.

the SWAP operator simultaneously, in minimum time, on a pair of two-level

three independent control actions, and that the total control strength is
bounded. These controls either affect the dynamics of the target system, under
the first perspective, or, simultaneously, the dynamics of both systems, in the
second view. We obtain our results by using techniques of geometric control
theory on Lie groups. In particular, we apply the Pontryagin Maximum Principle,

concrete the action of this operator on homogeneous polynomials when the root
system is of dihedral type and under a mild assumption on the multiplicity
function. In particular, we obtain a formula for the corresponding Dunkl kernel
and another representation of the generalized Bessel function already derived
in \cite{Demni0}. When the multiplicity function is everywhere constant, our
computations give a solution to the problem of counting the number of
decompositions of an element from a dihedral group into a fixed number of (non
necessarily simple) reflections. In the remainder of the paper, we supply
another method to derive the Dunkl kernel associated with dihedral systems from
the corresponding generalized Bessel function. This time, we use the shift
principle together with multiple combinations of Dunkl operators corresponding
to the vectors of the canonical basis of $\mathbb{R}^2$. When the dihedral
system is of order six and only in this case, a single combination suffices to
get the Dunkl kernel and agrees up to an isomorphism with the formula recently
obtained by Amri \cite[Lemma1]{Amri} in the case of a root system of type

CCA based approaches outperform AE based approaches for the task of transfer

maximizes correlation among the views when projected to the common subspace.
Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed CorrNet is
better than the above mentioned approaches with respect to its ability to learn

better than the ones learned using other state of the art approaches.

$0<\alpha\leq 2$) for building basic data processing tools in the context of
large-scale machine learning applications (e.g., classification, regression,
clustering, and near-neighbor search). After the processing by sign stable
random projections, the inner products of the processed data approximate
various types of nonlinear kernels depending on the value of $\alpha$. Thus,
this approach provides an effective strategy for approximating nonlinear
learning algorithms essentially at the cost of linear learning. When $\alpha
=2$, it is known that the corresponding nonlinear kernel is the arc-cosine
kernel. When $\alpha=1$, the procedure approximates the arc-cos-$\chi^2$ kernel
(under certain condition). When $\alpha\rightarrow0+$, it corresponds to the
resemblance kernel.
  From practitioners' perspective, the method of sign $\alpha$-stable random
projections is ready to be tested for large-scale learning applications, where
$\alpha$ can be simply viewed as a tuning parameter. What is missing in the
literature is an extensive empirical study to show the effectiveness of sign
stable random projections, especially for $\alpha\neq 2$ or 1. The paper
supplies such a study on a wide variety of classification datasets. In
particular, we compare shoulder-by-shoulder sign stable random projections with

measurements of the shock expansion and ambient density. We find that the
highest energy electrons are accelerated at the lowest densities and in the

instability criterion or a cloud-cloud collision could explain the location of
the outer edge, though we lack information to make conclusive remarks on either

constraints on model parameters from observations. This approach relies on the
ability to compute the likelihood of the data given a choice of model
parameters. In many practical situations, the likelihood function may however
be unavailable or intractable due to non-gaussian errors, non-linear
measurements processes, or complex data formats such as catalogs and maps. In
these cases, the simulation of mock data sets can often be made through forward
modeling. We discuss how Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) can be used in
these cases to derive an approximation to the posterior constraints using
simulated data sets. This technique relies on the sampling of the parameter
set, a distance metric to quantify the difference between the observation and
the simulations and summary statistics to compress the information in the data.
We first review the principles of ABC and discuss its implementation using a
Population Monte-Carlo (PMC) algorithm and the Mahalanobis distance metric. We
test the performance of the implementation using a Gaussian toy model. We then
apply the ABC technique to the practical case of the calibration of image
simulations for wide field cosmological surveys. We find that the ABC analysis
is able to provide reliable parameter constraints for this problem and is
therefore a promising technique for other applications in cosmology and
astrophysics. Our implementation of the ABC PMC method is made available via a

These accreting black holes have previously eluded detection due to their weak

between them. We suggest an alternative scenario where the observed mass ratios
of the SMBHs to bulges reflect the angular momentum distribution of infallen
gas such that the mass reaching the stable accretion disc is a small fraction
of that reaching the bulge region, averaged over the cosmological time scales.
We test this scenario using high resolution, large-scale cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations (without AGN feedback), assuming the angular momentum
distribution of gas landing in the bulge region to yield a Mestel disc that is
supported by independent simulations resolving the Bondi radii of SMBHs. A mass
ratio of $0.1-0.3\%$ between the very low angular momentum gas that free-falls
to the sub-parsec region to accrete to the SMBH and the overall star formation
rate is found. This ratio is found to increase with increasing redshift to
within a factor of $\sim 2$, suggesting that the SMBH to bulge ratio is nearly
redshift independent, with a modest increase with redshift, a testable
prediction. Furthermore, the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with
high Eddington ratios is expected to increase significantly with redshift.
Finally, while SMBHs and bulges are found to coevolve on $\sim 30-150$Myr time
scales or longer, there is indication that, on shorer time scales, the SMBH
accretion rate and star formation may be less correlated.

redshifts 1.5<z<3.1 and equivalent widths 0.1<W_r(1560)<1.7 A. The completeness
limit of our survey is W_r,lim(1560)~0.4 A. CI systems stronger than that are
more than one hundred-times rarer than DLAs at z_abs=2.5. The number of CI
systems per unit redshift increases significantly below z=2. We suggest that
the CI absorbers are closely related to the process of star formation and the
production of dust in galaxies. We derive the HI content of the CI systems and
find that a majority of them are sub-DLAs with N(HI)~10^20 atoms cm^-2. The
dust content of these absorbers is yet significant as seen from the redder
optical colours of the background QSOs and their reddened SEDs. The overall
N(HI) distribution of CI systems is relatively flat however. As a consequence,
among the CI systems classifying as DLAs there is a probable excess of strong
DLAs with log N(HI)>21 compared to systematic DLA surveys. We study empirical
relations between W_r(CI), N(HI), E(B-V) and the strength of the 2175 A
extinction feature, the latter being detected in about 30% of the CI absorbers.
We show that the 2175 A feature is weak compared to Galactic lines-of-sight
exhibiting the same amount of reddening. This is probably the consequence of
current or past star formation in the vicinity of the CI systems. We also find
that the strongest CI systems tend to have the largest amounts of dust and that
the metallicity of the gas and its molecular fraction is likely to be high in a
large number of cases.

1) matching stars to isochrones in color-color diagrams, and 2) solving for the

metallicity gradients in Leo I and II. For IC 1613 and Phoenix our data do not
have the radial extent to confirm a metallicity gradient for either galaxy.

spheroidal), Phoenix (dwarf transition) and IC 1613 (dwarf irregular) have
wider, less peaked MDFs than Leo I. A simple CEM is not the best fit for any of

a galaxy is reflected in the MDF, where broad MDFs are seen in galaxies that
have chemically evolved in relative isolation and narrowly peaked MDFs are seen
in galaxies that have experienced more complicated dynamical interactions

fainter than the expected GC peak) clusters within our sample. The LF of the
bright clusters is well fit by a peaked distribution similar to those observed
in the Milky Way (MW) and other galaxies. These bright clusters also have
similar size (r_{eff}) and spatial distributions as MW GCs. The LF of the faint
clusters, on the other hand, is well described by a power law, dN(L_V)/dL_V
proportional to L_V^alpha with alpha = -2.6 plus or minus 0.3, similar to those
observed for young and intermediate-age cluster systems in star forming
galaxies. We find that the faint clusters have larger typical r_{eff} than the
bright clusters, and have a flatter surface density profile, being more evenly
distributed, as we would expect for clusters associated with the disk. We use
the shape of the LF and predictions for mass-loss driven by two-body relaxation

that deals with optimization of large number of variables, and has several
sources of errors like the presence of dynamic objects. Since most large scale
approaches make the assumption of observing static scenes, dynamic objects are
relegated to the noise modeling section of such systems. This is an approach of
convenience since the RANSAC based framework used to compute most multiview
geometric quantities for static scenes naturally confine dynamic objects to the
class of outlier measurements. However, reconstructing dynamic objects along
with the static environment helps us get a complete picture of an urban
environment. Such understanding can then be used for important robotic tasks
like path planning for autonomous navigation, obstacle tracking and avoidance,
and other areas. In this paper, we propose a system for robust SLAM that works
in both static and dynamic environments. To overcome the challenge of dynamic
objects in the scene, we propose a new model to incorporate semantic
constraints into the reconstruction algorithm. While some of these constraints
are based on multi-layered dense CRFs trained over appearance as well as motion
cues, other proposed constraints can be expressed as additional terms in the
bundle adjustment optimization process that does iterative refinement of 3D
structure and camera / object motion trajectories. We show results on the
challenging KITTI urban dataset for accuracy of motion segmentation and
reconstruction of the trajectory and shape of moving objects relative to ground
truth. We are able to show average relative error reduction by a significant

non-linear evolution of the primordial power spectrum with positive running

largely erased when entering into the non-linear regime. For example, even if
the linear power spectrum at $k>10h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ is enhanced by $1-2$ orders
of magnitude, the enhancement much decreases to a factor of $2-3$ at late time

fluctuations weakly constrains the running parameters. When including
baryon-cooling effects (which strongly enhance the small-scale clustering), the
constraint is comparable or tighter than the PLANCK constraint, depending on

form solutions for both optimal cost and weight update can be achieved for any
feed-forward network using HJB equation in a simple yet elegant manner. The
proposed approach has been compared with some of the existing best performing

faster in convergence in terms of computational time. Some of the benchmark
test data such as 8-bit parity, breast cancer and credit approval, as well as
2D Gabor function have been used to validate our claims. The paper also
discusses issues related to global optimization. The limitations of popular
deterministic weight update laws are critiqued and the possibility of global

two components, called DIR Manager (or, shortly, the manager) and DIR Backup
Agent (shortly, the backup). One manager and a set of backups is located in the
system to be `guarded', one component per node. At this point the DIR net
weaves a web which substantially does two things: 1) makes itself tolerant to a
number of possible faults, and 2) gathers information pertaining the run of the
user application. As soon as an error occurs within the DIR net, the system
executes built-in recovery actions that allow itself to continue processing
despite a number of hardware/software faults, possibly doing a graceful
degradation of its features; when an error occurs in the user application, the
DIR net, by means of custom- and user-defined detection tools, is informed of
such events and runs one or more recovery strategies, both built-in and coded
by the user using an ancillary compile-time tool, the rl translator. Such tools
translates the user-defined strategies into a binary `R-code', i.e., a
pseudo-code interpreted by a special component of the DIR net, the Recovery
Interpreter, rint (in a sense, rint is a r-code virtual machine.) This document
describes the generic component of the DIR net, a function which can behave
either as manager or as backup.

Here, we study a molecule containing a Co and an Fe atoms stacked between three

These figures are superior to other molecules with the same transition metal,

Green's functions calculations based on density functional theory predict
excellent spin-filtering properties both in tunnel and contact transport
regimes. However, exciting the first magnetic state drastically reduces the

reverberation lag as a function of the varying accretion disk brightness. We
carried out multiband, multiepoch photometric observations of the nucleus of

sublimation in our data, since they show no increase in the hot dust
reverberation delay directly correlated with substantial accretion disk flux
increases in the observed period. Instead, we find that the hot dust in NGC
4151 appears to merely heat up, and the hot dust temperature closely tracks the
accretion disk luminosity variations. We find indications of a decreased
reverberation delay within the observed period from t = 42.5 +/- 4.0 days in
2010 to t = 29.6 +/- 1.7 days in 2013-2014. Such a varying reverberation radius
on longer timescales would explain the intrinsic scatter observed in the
radius-luminosity relation of dust around AGNs.\\ Our observations rule out
that a second, larger dust component within a 100-light-day radius from the
source contributes significantly to the observed near-infrared flux in this

another string $L$ of length $m\geq n$ on the alphabet $[1..d]$ is the minimum
number of insertions, and swaps of pairs of adjacent symbols, converting $S$
into $L$. Contrarily to other correction distances, computing it is NP-Hard in
the size $d$ of the alphabet. We describe an algorithm computing this distance
in time within $O(d^2 nm g^{d-1})$, where there are $n_\alpha$ occurrences of
$\alpha$ in $S$, $m_\alpha$ occurrences of $\alpha$ in $L$, and where
$g=\max_{\alpha\in[1..d]} \min\{n_\alpha,m_\alpha-n_\alpha\}$ measures the
difficulty of the instance. The difficulty $g$ is bounded by above by various
terms, such as the length of the shortest string $S$, and by the maximum number
of occurrences of a single character in $S$. Those results illustrate how, in
many cases, the correction distance between two strings can be easier to
compute than in the worst case scenario.

highlighted in three example dynamic systems commonly found in control theory.

nonlocal diffusion equation, $\partial _t u=J*u-u$, where $J$ is a smooth,
radially symmetric kernel with support $B_d(0)\subset\mathbb{R}^2$. The problem
is set in an exterior two-dimensional domain which excludes a hole
$\mathcal{H}$, and with zero Dirichlet data on $\mathcal{H}$. In the far field
scale, $\xi_1\le |x|t^{-1/2}\le \xi_2$ with $\xi_1,\xi_2>0$, the scaled
function $\log t\, u(x,t)$ behaves as a multiple of the fundamental solution
for the local heat equation with a certain diffusivity determined by $J$. The
proportionality constant, which characterizes the first non-trivial term in the
asymptotic behavior of the mass, is given by means of the asymptotic \lq
logarithmic momentum' of the solution,
$\lim_{t\to\infty}\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}u(x,t)\log|x|\,dx$. This asymptotic
quantity can be easily computed in terms of the initial data. In the near field
scale, $|x|\le t^{1/2}h(t)$ with $\lim_{t\to\infty} h(t)=0$, the scaled
function $t(\log t)^2u(x,t)/\log |x|$ converges to a multiple of $\phi(x)/\log
|x|$, where $\phi$ is the unique stationary solution of the problem that
behaves as $\log|x|$ when $|x|\to\infty$. The proportionality constant is
obtained through a matching procedure with the far field limit. Finally, in the
very far field, $|x|\ge t^{1/2} g(t)$ with $g(t)\to\infty$, the solution is
proved to be of order $o((t\log t)^{-1})$.

unconventional superconductors. We allow the ground state of the effective gap
operator $K_{T_c}+V$ to be $n$-fold degenerate and the resulting GL theory then
couples $n$ order parameters. In part II, we study examples of multi-component
GL theories which arise from an isotropic BCS theory. We study the cases of (a)
pure $d$-wave order parameters and (b) mixed $(s+d)$-wave order parameters, in
two and three dimensions. In part III, we present explicit choices of
spherically symmetric interactions $V$ which produce the examples in part II.

$K_{T_c}+V$ of arbitrary angular momentum, for open sets of of parameter
values. This is in stark contrast with Schr\""odinger operators $-\nabla^2+V$,
for which the ground state is always non-degenerate. Along the way, we prove

particularly for emergency demand response (EDR), which saves the power grid
from incurring blackouts during emergency situations. However, currently, data
centers typically participate in EDR by turning on backup (diesel) generators,
which is both expensive and environmentally unfriendly. In this paper, we focus
on ""greening"" demand response in multi-tenant data centers, i.e., colocation
data centers, by designing a pricing mechanism through which the data center
operator can efficiently extract load reductions from tenants during emergency
periods to fulfill energy reduction requirement for EDR. In particular, we
propose a pricing mechanism for both mandatory and voluntary EDR programs,
ColoEDR, that is based on parameterized supply function bidding and provides
provably near-optimal efficiency guarantees, both when tenants are price-taking
and when they are price-anticipating. In addition to analytic results, we
extend the literature on supply function mechanism design, and evaluate ColoEDR
using trace-based simulation studies. These validate the efficiency analysis
and conclude that the pricing mechanism is both beneficial to the environment
and to the data center operator (by decreasing the need for backup diesel
generation), while also aiding tenants (by providing payments for load
reductions).

compensation taking place on such a profile by applying Newton laws of motion
to the profile and deliver an equation for the magnitude and the direction of
the flow force. This paper shows that both the magnitude and the direction of
the compensating flow force are incorrect if calculated from the textbook
equation. A corrected analysis of the dynamic forces is presented that are in
agreement with earlier experiments by this author. It follows that the
compensating flow force should be calculated from the static-pressure imbalance
on the spool profile. That is, not Newton but Pascal law should be applied to
calculate the compensating flow force.

rise to integrable dynamics of non-intersecting particle systems.
  In previous work, the author exhibited a RS correspondence for geometric
crystals by constructing a Littelmann path model, in general Lie type. Since
this representation-theoretic map takes as input a continuous path on a
Euclidian space, the natural starting measure is the Wiener measure. In this
paper, we characterize the measures induced by Brownian motion through the RS
map.
  On the one hand, the highest weight in the output is a remarkable Markov
process (the Whittaker process), and can be interpreted as a weakly
non-intersecting particle system which deforms Brownian motion in a Weyl
chamber. One the other hand, the measure induced on geometric crystals is given
by the Landau-Ginzburg potential for complete flag manifolds which appear in
mirror symmetry. The measure deforms the uniform measure on string polytopes.
  Whittaker functions, which appear as volumes of geometric crystals, play the
role of characters in the theory.

infectious bites from mosquitoes) between vectors and humans after a contact to
a single infected individual. This approach permits us to generally derive the
moments of the distribution and, under some conditions, derive the distribution
function of the vectorial capacity. A stochastic modeling framework is helpful
for analyzing the dynamics of disease spreading, such as performing sensitivity
analysis.

gravity, one without. The very existence of such an equivalence imposes strong
consistency conditions which are, in the nature of the case, hard to satisfy.
Recently a particularly deep condition of this kind, relating the minimum of a
probe brane action to a gravitational bulk action (in a Euclidean formulation),
has been recognised; and the question arises as to the circumstances under
which it, and its Lorentzian counterpart, are satisfied. We discuss the fact
that there are physically interesting situations in which one or both versions
might, in principle, \emph{not} be satisfied. These arise in two distinct
circumstances: first, when the bulk is not an Einstein manifold, and, second,
in the presence of angular momentum. Focusing on the application of holography
to the quark-gluon plasma (of the various forms arising in the early Universe
and in heavy-ion collisions), we find that these potential violations never
actually occur. This suggests that the consistency condition is a ""law of
physics"" expressing a particular aspect of holography.

distribution of information encoded in an optical beam. It is not a problem to
accomplish this in a classical system since classical information can be copied
at will. However, challenges arise in quantum system because extra quantum
noise is often added when the information content of a quantum state is
distributed to various users. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a quantum
information tap by using a fiber optical parametric amplifier (FOPA) with
correlated inputs, whose noise is reduced by the destructive quantum
interference through quantum entanglement between the signal and the idler
input fields. By measuring the noise figure of the FOPA and comparing with a
regular FOPA, we observe an improvement of 0.7+-0.1 dB and 0.84+-0.09 dB from
the signal and idler outputs, respectively. When the low noise FOPA functions
as an information splitter, the device has a total information transfer
coefficient of Ts+Ti=1.47+-0.2, which is greater than the classical limit of 1.
Moreover, this fiber based device works at the 1550 nm telecom band, so it is
compatible with the current fiber-optical network.

several test simulations to compare our method with a conventional splitting
method in which the daughter particles are placed isotropically over the local
smoothing length. We show that, with our method, the density deviation after
splitting is reduced by a factor of about two compared with the conventional
method. Splitting would smooth out the anisotropic density structure if the
daughters are distributed isotropically, but our scheme allows the daughter
particles to trace the original density distribution with length scales of the
mean separation of their parent. We apply the particle splitting to simulations
of the primordial gas cloud collapse. The thermal evolution is accurately
followed to the hydrogen number density of 10^12 /cc. With the effective mass
resolution of ~10^-4 Msun after the multi-step particle splitting, the

investigate the effect of combining our geo-spatial features with temporal

several experiments, including well-known feature analyses. Such analyses show
how much our proposed geo-spatial features contribute to improve the overall

Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are excellent new materials having extraordinary

fabricating composites of varying concentrations of CNTs with PMMA and PC and
measurements of thermal conductivity data by a simple transient heat flow. The
samples in disk shapes of around 2 cm diameters and 0.2 cm thickness with CNT
concentrations varying up to 10 wt percent were fabricated. By keeping one end
of the discs at steam temperature, the temperature of the other end was noted
for each sample after 10 s. The rise in temperature was correlated with thermal
conductivity which was appropriately calibrated. We found that both PMMA and PC
measured high thermal conductivity with increase in the concentration of CNTs.
The thermal conductivity of PMMA rose from about 0.2 W/mK to 0.4 W/mK at 10
wtpercent of CNT whereas for PC, it rose from about 0.2 W/mK to 0.9 W/mK at 10

complete disintegration by Coulomb explosion and minimize radiation damage due
to nuclear motion, but electronic damage is still present. The major
contribution to the electronic damage comes from the plasma generated in the
sample that is strongly dependent on the amount of Auger ionization. Since the
Auger process has a characteristic time scale on the order of femtoseconds, one
may expect that its contribution will be significantly reduced for attosecond
pulses. Here, we study the effect of electronic damage on the SPI at pulse
durations from 0.1 fs to 10 fs and in a large range of XFEL fluences to
determine optimal conditions for imaging of biological samples. We analyzed the
contribution of different electronic excitation processes and found that at
fluences higher than $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ photons/$\mu$m$^2$ (depending on the
photon energy and pulse duration) the diffracted signal saturates and does not
increase further. A significant gain in the signal is obtained by reducing the
pulse duration from 10 fs to 1 fs. Pulses below 1 fs duration do not give a
significant gain in the scattering signal in comparison with 1 fs pulses. We

information of the nodes to route the data. This technique uses only local
information of the communication graph topology and does not require
computational effort to build routing table or equivalent data structures. A
particularly efficient implementation of this paradigm is greedy routing, where
along the data path the nodes forward the data to a neighboring node that is
closer to the destination. The decreasing distance to the destination implies
the success of the routing scheme. A related problem is to consider an abstract
graph and decide whether there exists an embedding of the graph in a metric
space, called a greedy embedding, such that greedy routing guarantees the
delivery of the data. In the present paper, we use a metric-free definition of
greedy path and we show that greedy routing is successful on planar
triangulations without considering the existence of greedy embedding. Our
algorithm rely entirely on the combinatorial description of the graph structure
and the coordinate system requires O(log(n)) bits where n is the number of
nodes in the graph. Previous works on greedy routing make use of the embedding
to route the data. In particular, in our framework, it is known that there
exists an embedding of planar triangulations such that greedy routing
guarantees the delivery of data. The result presented in this article leads to
the question whether the success of (any) greedy routing strategy is always
coupled with the existence of a greedy embedding?

also works for the Helmholtz equation. However, it requires small size of the

rigidity under the competing attractions of two walls with arbitrary
permeabilities. This system mimics the dynamics of confined membranes. We use a
two-dimension hydrodynamic model, where membranes are effectively
one-dimensional objects. In a previous work [T. Le Goff et al, Phys. Rev. E 90,
032114 (2014)], we have shown that this model predicts frozen states caused by
bending rigidity-induced oscillatory interactions between kinks (or domain
walls). We here demonstrate that in the presence of tension, potential
asymmetry, or thermal noise, there is a finite threshold above which frozen
states disappear, and perpetual coarsening is restored. Depending on the
driving force, the transition to coarsening exhibits different scenarios.
First, for membranes under tension, small tensions can only lead to transient
coarsening or partial disordering, while above a finite threshold, membrane
oscillations disappear and perpetual coarsening is found. Second, potential
asymmetry is relevant in the non-conserved case only, i.e. for permeable walls,
where it induces a drift force on the kinks, leading to a fast coarsening
process via kink-antikink annihilation. However, below some threshold, the
drift force can be balanced by the oscillatory interactions between kinks, and
frozen adhesion patches can still be observed. Finally, at long times, noise
restores coarsening with standard exponents depending on the permeability of
the walls. However, the typical time for the appearance of coarsening exhibits
an Arrhenius form. As a consequence, a finite noise amplitude is needed in

  Graphs",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the core algorithmic problems related to verification of systems
with respect to three classical quantitative properties, namely, the
mean-payoff property, the ratio property, and the minimum initial credit for
energy property. The algorithmic problem given a graph and a quantitative
property asks to compute the optimal value (the infimum value over all traces)
from every node of the graph. We consider graphs with constant treewidth, and
it is well-known that the control-flow graphs of most programs have constant
treewidth. Let $n$ denote the number of nodes of a graph, $m$ the number of
edges (for constant treewidth graphs $m=O(n)$) and $W$ the largest absolute
value of the weights. Our main theoretical results are as follows. First, for
constant treewidth graphs we present an algorithm that approximates the
mean-payoff value within a multiplicative factor of $\epsilon$ in time $O(n
\cdot \log (n/\epsilon))$ and linear space, as compared to the classical
algorithms that require quadratic time. Second, for the ratio property we
present an algorithm that for constant treewidth graphs works in time $O(n
\cdot \log (|a\cdot b|))=O(n\cdot\log (n\cdot W))$, when the output is
$\frac{a}{b}$, as compared to the previously best known algorithm with running
time $O(n^2 \cdot \log (n\cdot W))$. Third, for the minimum initial credit
problem we show that (i) for general graphs the problem can be solved in
$O(n^2\cdot m)$ time and the associated decision problem can be solved in
$O(n\cdot m)$ time, improving the previous known $O(n^3\cdot m\cdot \log
(n\cdot W))$ and $O(n^2 \cdot m)$ bounds, respectively; and (ii) for constant
treewidth graphs we present an algorithm that requires $O(n\cdot \log n)$ time,
improving the previous known $O(n^4 \cdot \log (n \cdot W))$ bound.

pair productions in vacuum; the relationship between the production rate and
the electric field is different, depending on the dimension of the system. In
this paper, we make an offer of another model for the pair productions, in
which weak values are incorporated: energy fluctuations trigger the pair
production, and a weak value appears as the velocity of a particle there.
Although our model is only available for the approximation of the pair
production rates, the weak value reveals a new aspect of the pair production.
Especially, within the first order, our estimation approximately agrees with
the exponential decreasing rate of the Landau-Zener tunneling through the mass
energy gap. In other words, such tunneling can be associated with energy
fluctuations via the weak value, when the tunneling gap can be regarded as so
small due to the high electric field.

repulsions such particles slow down at high density: their propulsive effort is
unchanged, but their average speed along ${\bf u}$ becomes $v(\rho) < v$. A
fruitful avenue is then to construct a mean-field description in which
particles are ghost-like and have no collisions, but swim at a variable speed
$v$ that is an explicit function or functional of the density $\rho$. We give
numerical evidence that the recently shown equivalence of the fluctuating

microscopic models of ABPs and RTPs interacting with repulsive forces.

that the ligand stabilizes the interaction of the distal ""kissing loop""

could be possible to provide a more detailed perspective on the formation of

assessed the convergence of the results by using two alternative initialization

analyze base contacts. Our simulations qualitatively indicated that the ligand

However, the physical origin of the mechanism driving the observed outflows,
whether due to energy-driving or radiation-driving, is still debated; and in
some cases, it is not clear whether the central source is an active galactic
nucleus (AGN) or a nuclear starburst. Here we study the role of radiation
pressure on dust in driving galactic-scale AGN outflows, and analyse the
dynamics of the outflowing shell as a function of the underlying physical
parameters. We show that high-velocity outflows ($\gtrsim$1000 km/s) with large
momentum flux ($\gtrsim 10 L/c$) can be obtained, by taking into account the
effects of radiation trapping. In particular, the high observed values of the
momentum boosts can be reproduced, provided that the shell is initially
optically thick to the reprocessed infrared radiation. Alternatively, the
inferred measurements of the momentum flux may be significantly biased by AGN
variability. In this context, the observations of powerful outflows on
kiloparsec scales, with no or weak signs of ongoing nuclear activity at the
present time, could be re-interpreted as relics of past AGN episodes.

next layer consists of standard nuclear matter forming a ionic crust, hovering
on the top of the quarksphere and prevented from falling by a strong dipolar

confined in the quarksphere by the strong interaction, but electrons can leak
outside forming a few hundreds Fermi thick electron layer separating the ionic
crust from the underlying quark matter. The ionic matter and the crystalline
color superconducting matter constitute two electromagnetically coupled crust
layers. We study the torsional oscillations of these two layers. Remarkably, we
find that if a fraction larger than $10^{-4}$ of the energy of a Vela-like

in the Perseus molecular cloud by using Arecibo HI emission and absorption
measurements toward 26 radio continuum sources. The spin temperature and
optical depth of individual HI components are derived along each line-of-sight,
enabling us to estimate the correction for high optical depth. We examine two
different methods for the correction, Gaussian decomposition and isothermal
methods, and find that they are consistent (maximum correction factor ~ 1.2)
likely due to the relatively low optical depth and insignificant contribution
from the diffuse radio continuum emission for Perseus. We apply the correction
to the optically thin HI column density on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and find
that the total HI mass increases by ~10%. Using the corrected HI column density
image and far-infrared data from the IRIS Survey, we then derive the H2 column
density on ~0.4 pc scales. For five dark and star-forming sub-regions, the HI
surface density is uniform with Sigma_HI ~ 7-9 solar mass/pc2, in agreement
with the minimum HI surface density required for shielding H2 against
photodissociation. As a result, Sigma_H2/Sigma_HI and Sigma_HI+Sigma_H2 show a
tight relation. Our results are consistent with predictions for H2 formation in
steady state and chemical equilibrium, and suggest that H2 formation is mainly
responsible for the Sigma_HI saturation in Perseus. We also compare the
optically thick HI with the observed ""CO-dark"" gas, and find that the optically
thick HI only accounts for ~20% of the ""CO-dark"" gas in Perseus.

liquid tetrahydrofuran (THF). Our findings not only provide a picture of the
stable species at the interface, but also explain how this system can support
reversible Mg deposition and as such we provide insights in how to design other
electrolytes for Mg plating and stripping. The active depositing species are
identified to be (MgCl)$^+$ monomers coordinated by THF, which exhibit
preferential adsorption on Mg compared to possible passivating species (such as
THF solvent or neutral MgCl$_2$ complexes). Upon deposition, the energy to
desolvate these adsorbed complexes and facilitate charge-transfer is shown to
be small ($\sim$ 61 $-$ 46.2 kJ mol$^{-1}$ to remove 3 THF from the strongest
adsorbing complex), and the stable orientations of the adsorbed but desolvated
(MgCl)$^+$ complexes appear favorable for charge-transfer. Finally,
observations of Mg-Cl dissociation at the Mg surface at very low THF
coordinations (0 and 1) suggest that deleterious Cl incorporation in the anode

facilitating the Mg removal reaction.

MIMO systems is proposed. In this approach, the difficulty of matrix inversion
is attributed to the incomplete definition of the dot product. The general
definition of dot product implies that the columns of channel matrix are always
orthogonal whereas, in practice, they may be not. If the latter information can
be incorporated into dot product, then the unknowns can be directly computed
from projections without inverting the channel matrix. By doing so, the
proposed method is able to achieve an exact solution with a 25% reduction in
computational complexity as compared to the QR method. Proposed method is
stable, offers an extra flexibility of computing any single unknown, and can be
implemented in just twelve lines of code.

obtain a novel set of mode configurations. This leads to a realistic emission
spectrum featuring black hole- and white hole emission for different

whether transitivity can be safely combined with decidable classes of

  First, we prove that transitivity is incompatible with one of the simplest
decidable classes, namely aGRD (acyclic graph of rule dependencies), which
clarifies the landscape of `finite expansion sets' of rules.
  Second, we show that transitivity can be safely added to linear rules (a
subclass of guarded rules, which generalizes the description logic DL-Lite-R)

syntactic restriction on the rule set. This is shown by means of a novel query
rewriting algorithm that is specially tailored to handle transitivity rules.

interactions, in a momentum-conserving solvent. To address phase separation we
introduce a scalar concentration field $\phi$ with advective-diffusive
dynamics. Activity creates a contribution
$\Sigma_{ij}=-\zeta((\partial_i\phi)(\partial_j\phi)-(\nabla\phi)^{2}\delta_{ij}/d)$
to the deviatoric stress, where $\zeta$ is odd under time reversal and $d$ is
the number of spatial dimensions; this causes an effective interfacial tension
contribution that is negative for contractile swimmers. We predict that domain
growth then ceases at a length scale where diffusive coarsening is balanced by
active stretching of interfaces, and confirm this numerically. Thus the
interplay of activity and hydrodynamics is highly nontrivial, even without
alignment interactions.

afterglow spectra of high redshift long Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). This is done
employing simulations of cosmic reionization, together with the instrumental
characteristics of the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). We find that absorption
features could be marginally (with a S/N larger than a few) detected by LOFAR
at z>7 if the GRB originated from PopIII stars, while the detection would be
easier if the noise were reduced by one order of magnitude, i.e. similar to
what is expected for the first phase of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA1-low).
On the other hand, more standard GRBs are too dim to be detected even with ten
times the sensitivity of SKA1-low, and only in the most optimistic case can a
S/N larger than a few be reached at z>9.

of the right-angled Artin group $A_\Gamma$ associated to a simplicial graph
$\Gamma$. First, we identify two conditions -- denoted (B1) and (B2) -- on
$\Gamma$ which together imply that $H^1(G, Z)=0$ for certain finite-index
subgroups $G<Aut(A_\Gamma)$. On the other hand we will show that (B2) is
equivalent to the matrix group ${\mathcal H} = {\rm Im}(Aut(A_\Gamma) \to
Aut(H_1(A_\Gamma))) <GL(n,Z)$ not being virtually indicable, and also to
$\mathcal H$ having Kazhdan's property (T). As a consequence, $Aut(A_\Gamma)$
virtually surjects onto $Z$ whenever $\Gamma$ does not satisfy (B2). In
addition, we give an extra property of $\Gamma$ ensuring that $Aut(A_\Gamma)$
and $Out(A_\Gamma)$ virtually surject onto $Z$. Finally, in the appendix we
offer some remarks on the linearity problem for $Aut(A_\Gamma)$.

a positive solution to an overdetermined elliptic problem (OEP for short). We
consider two types of OEPs.
  First, we study narrow properties of such domains in a Hadamard manifold and
characterize the boundary at infinity. We give an upper bound for the Hausdorff
dimension of its boundary at infinity and how the domain behaves at infinity.
This shows interesting relations with the Singular Yamabe Problem.
  Later, we focus on extremal domains in the Hyperbolic Space $\mathbb H ^n$.
Symmetry and boundedness properties will be shown. In certain sense, we extend
Levitt-Rosenberg's Theorem \cite{LR} to OEPs, which suggests a strong relation
with constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in $\mathbb H ^n$. In particular, we
are able to prove the Berestycki-Caffarelli-Nirenberg Conjecture under certain
assumptions either on the boundary at infinity of the extremal domain or on the
OEP itself.
  Also a height estimate for solutions on extremal domains in a Hyperbolic

sources, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk or (semi-)automatic algorithmic
techniques. In this work, we present a Gaussian process (GP) based technique
for simultaneously identifying which images of a training set have unreliable
annotation and learning a segmentation model in which the negative effect of
these images is suppressed. Alternatively, the model can also just be used to
identify the most reliably annotated images from the training set, which can
then be used for training any other segmentation method. By relying on ""deep

learned and its hyperparameter determined efficiently using only matrix
operations and gradient-based optimization. This makes our method scalable even

to construct the effective action for dynamical twistless torsional

demonstrate that this exactly agrees with the most general forms of the HL

open-source visualization package, we analyzed oil production rate, water
breakthrough time, and spatial and temporal distribution of residual oil
saturation. The effective permeability of the reservoir exhibits large-scale
anisotropy created by the organization of OFC cross-sets within unit bars, and
the organization of unit bars within compound bars. As a result oil sweep
efficiency critically depends on the direction of the pressure gradient. When
pressure gradient is oriented normal to paleoflow direction, the total oil
production and the water breakthrough time are larger, and remaining oil
saturation is smaller. This result is found regardless of the proportion or
connectivity of the OFC cross-sets, within the ranges examined. Contrary to
expectations, the total amount of trapped oil due to the effect of capillary
trapping does not depend on the pressure gradient within the examined range.
Hence the pressure difference between production and injection wells does not
affect sweep efficiency, although the spatial distribution of oil remaining in
the reservoir depends on this value. Whether or not clusters of connected OFC
span the domain does not affect sweep efficiency, only the absolute rate of oil
production. The RVA/Paraview application allowed us to visualize and examine
these non-intuitive results.

detail, paying particular attention to the input that needs to be provided
through the equation of state and distinguishing between normal and superfluid
regions. The analysis highlights a number of key issues that should be kept in
mind whenever equation of state data is compiled from nuclear physics for use
in neutron star calculations. We provide explicit results for a particular
stellar model and a specific nucleonic equation of state, making use of cooling
simulations to show how the local wave spectrum evolves as the star ages. Our
results show that the composition gradient is effectively dominated by the
muons whenever they are present. When the star cools below the superfluid
transition, the support for g-modes at lower densities (where there are no
muons) is entirely thermal. We confirm the recent suggestion that the g-modes
in this region may be unstable, but our results indicate that this instability
will be weak and would only be present for a brief period of the star's life.
Our analysis accounts for the presence of thermal excitations encoded in
entrainment between the entropy and the superfluid component. Finally, we
discuss the complete spectrum, including the normal sound waves and, in
superfluid regions, the second sound.

extremely diluted electron systems obtained by doping semiconductor quantum
dots. Here we investigate the role that different surface effects, namely
electronic spill-out and diffuse surface scattering, play in the optical
properties of these ultra-low electron density nanosystems. Diffuse scattering
originates from imperfections or roughness at a microscopic scale on the
surface. Using an electromagnetic theory that describes this mechanism in
conjunction with a dielectric function including the quantum size effect, we
find that the LSPRs show an oscillatory behavior both in position and width for
large particles and a strong blueshift in energy and an increased width for
smaller radii, consistent with recent experimental results for photodoped ZnO
nanocrystals. We thus show that the commonly ignored process of diffuse surface
scattering is a more important mechanism affecting the plasmonic properties of
ultra-low electron density nanoparticles than the spill-out effect.

habitability studies based on the spatial-temporal distribution of planetary
surface temperatures. The ESTM adopts a surface Energy Balance Model
complemented by: radiative-convective atmospheric column calculations, a set of
physically-based parameterizations of meridional transport, and descriptions of
surface and cloud properties more refined than in standard EBMs. The
parameterization is valid for rotating terrestrial planets with shallow
atmospheres and moderate values of axis obliquity (epsilon >= 45^o). Comparison
with a 3D model of atmospheric dynamics from the literature shows that the
equator-to-pole temperature differences predicted by the two models agree
within ~5K when the rotation rate, insolation, surface pressure and planet
radius are varied in the intervals 0.5 <= Omega/Omega_o <= 2, 0.75 <= S/S_o <=
1.25, 0.3 <= p/(1 bar) <= 10, and 0.5 <= R/R_o <= 2, respectively. The ESTM has
an extremely low computational cost and can be used when the planetary
parameters are scarcely known (as for most exoplanets) and/or whenever many
runs for different parameter configurations are needed. Model simulations of a
test-case exoplanet (Kepler-62e) indicate that an uncertainty in surface
pressure within the range expected for terrestrial planets may impact the mean
temperature by ~60 K. Within the limits of validity of the ESTM, the impact of
surface pressure is larger than that predicted by uncertainties in rotation
rate, axis obliquity, and ocean fractions. We discuss the possibility of
performing a statistical ranking of planetary habitability taking advantage of
the flexibility of the ESTM.

emission properties with SUMER spectrographic and SDO/AIA imaging observations.
We find that the emission intensity and line width oscillations are a quarter
period out of phase with Doppler shift velocity both in time and spatial
domain, which can be used to identify a standing slow mode wave from
spectroscopic observations. However, the longitudinal overtones could be only
measured with the assistance of imagers. We find emission intensity asymmetry
in the positive and negative modulations, this is because the contribution
function pertaining to the atomic emission process responds differently to
positive and negative temperature variations. One may detect \textbf{half}
periodicity close to the loop apex, where emission intensity modulation is
relatively small. The line-of-sight projection affects the observation of
Doppler shift significantly. A more accurate estimate of the amplitude of

factor of $1-2\theta/\pi$ rather than the traditionally used $\cos\theta$.

a major rewrite with the blk-mq project to move from a single request queue to
a multi-queue model. The Linux SCSI subsystem rework to make use of this new
model, known as scsi-mq, has been merged into the Linux kernel and work is
underway for dm-multipath support in the upcoming Linux 4.0 kernel. These
pieces were necessary to make use of the multi-queue block layer in a Lustre
parallel filesystem with high availability requirements. We undertook adding
support of the 3.18 kernel to Lustre with scsi-mq and dm-multipath patches to
evaluate the potential of these efficiency improvements. In this paper we
evaluate the block-level performance of scsi-mq with backing storage hardware
representative of a HPC-targerted Lustre filesystem. Our findings show that
SCSI write request latency is reduced by as much as 13.6%. Additionally, when
profiling the CPU usage of our prototype Lustre filesystem, we found that CPU
idle time increased by a factor of 7 with Linux 3.18 and blk-mq as compared to

(mass ratio from 1:70 to 1:8) on the radial distribution of chemical abundances

pure N-body tree-code model without hydrodynamics and star formation was used.
We computed a large set of mergers with different initial satellite masses,
positions, and orbital velocities. We find that there is no significant
metallicity change at any radius of the primary galaxy in the case of accretion
of a low-mass satellite of 10$^9$ M$_{\odot}$ (mass ratio 1:70) except for the
special case of prograde satellite motion in the disk plane of the host galaxy.
The accretion of a satellite of a mass $\gtrsim3\times10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ (mass
ratio 1:23) results in an appreciable increase of the chemical abundances at
galactocentric distances larger than $\sim10$ kpc. The radial abundance
gradient flattens in the range of galactocentric distances from 5 to 15 kpc in
the case of a merger with a satellite with a mass $\gtrsim3\times10^9$
M$_{\odot}$. There is no significant change in the abundance gradient slope in
the outer disk (from $\sim15$ kpc up to 25 kpc) in any merger while the scatter
in metallicities at a given radius significantly increases for most of the
satellite's initial masses/positions compared to the case of an isolated
galaxy. This argues against attributing the break (flattening) of the abundance
gradient near the optical radius observed in the extended disks of Milky
Way-like galaxies only to merger-induced stellar migration.

occupied electronic structure of the TI. For all coverages at room temperature
and for those equivalent to less than 0.1 monolayer at low temperature all
three metals lead to a downward shift of the TI's bands with respect to the
Fermi level. At room temperature Ag appears to intercalate efficiently into the
van der Waals gap of BSTS, accompanied by low-level substitution of the Te/Se
atoms of the termination layer of the crystal. This Te/Se substitution with
silver increases significantly for low temperature adsorption, and can even
dominate the electrostatic environment of the Bi/Sb atoms in the BSTS
near-surface region. On the other hand, Fe and Nb evaporants remain close to
the termination layer of the crystal. On room temperature deposition, they
initially substitute isoelectronically for Bi as a function of coverage, before
substituting for Te/Se atoms. For low temperature deposition, Fe and Nb are too
immobile for substitution processes and show a behaviour consistent with
clustering on the surface. For both Ag and Fe/Nb, these differing adsorption
pathways leads to the qualitatively similar and remarkable behavior for low
temperature deposition that the chemical potential first moves upward (n-type
dopant behavior) and then downward (p-type behavior) on increasing coverage.

consider a fullduplex H-AP which simultaneously transmits energy signals and
receives information signals. In this scenario, we address a joint subcarrier
scheduling and power allocation problem to maximize the sum-rate under two
cases: perfect self-interference cancelation (SIC) where the H-AP fully
eliminates its self interference (SI) and imperfect SIC where the residual SI
exist. In general, the problems for both cases are non-convex due to the
subcarrier scheduling, and thus it requires an exhaustive search method, which
is prohibitively complicated to obtain the globally optimal solution. In order
to reduce the complexity, for the perfect SIC scenario, we jointly optimize
subcarrier scheduling and power allocation by applying the Lagrange duality
method. Next, for the imperfect SIC case, the problem is more complicated due
to the SI at the H-AP. To solve the problem, we propose an iterative algorithm
based on the projected gradient method. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm for the case of perfect SIC exhibits only negligible
sum-rate performance loss compared to the optimal algorithm, and the proposed

the focus on pairs of counter-convecting (""heterodirectional"") transport PDEs
with distributed local coupling and with controls at one or both boundaries. A
recent extension allows stabilization using only one control for a system
containing an arbitrary number of coupled transport PDEs that convect at
different speeds against the direction of the PDE whose boundary is actuated.
In this paper we present a solution to the fully general case, in which the
number of PDEs in either direction is arbitrary, and where actuation is applied
on only one boundary (to all the PDEs that convect downstream from that
boundary). To solve this general problem, we solve, as a special case, the
problem of control of coupled ""homodirectional"" hyperbolic linear PDEs, where
multiple transport PDEs convect in the same direction with arbitrary local
coupling. Our approach is based on PDE backstepping and yields solutions to
stabilization, by both full-state and observer-based output feedback,
trajectory planning, and trajectory tracking problems.

geometry of those exponent vectors considered as elements of ${\mathbb Z}^2$ or
${\mathbb R}^2$. This point of view should be useful both as a way to visualize
properties of these codes and as a guide to heuristic searches for good codes
constructed in this fashion. In particular, we will use these ideas to see a
reason why these constructions have been so successful over the field ${\mathbb

channel in both the full- and half-duplex modes by combining coherent relaying,
independent relaying and partial relaying strategies. For the full-duplex mode,
the relay partially decodes each user's information in each block and forwards
this partial information coherently with the source user to the destination
user in the next block as in block Markov coding. In addition, the relay
independently broadcasts a binning index of both users' decoded information
parts in the next block as in independent network coding. Each technique has a
different impact on the relay power usage and the rate region. We further
analyze in detail the independent partial DF scheme and derive in closed-form
link regimes when this scheme achieves a strictly larger rate region than just
time-sharing between its constituent techniques, direct transmission and
independent DF relaying, and when it reduces to a simpler scheme. For the
half-duplex mode, we propose a 6-phase time-division scheme that incorporates
all considered relaying techniques and uses joint decoding simultaneously over
all receiving phases. Numerical results show significant rate gains over
existing DF schemes, obtained by performing link adaptation of the composite
scheme based on the identified link regimes.

governs the physics of accretion and of the resulting high-energy emission in
accreting pulsars. Studies of the cyclotron resonant scattering features
(CRSFs) seen as absorption lines in the X-ray spectra of the pulsars permit
direct measuremets of the field strength. Aims: From an analysis of a number of
pointed observations with different instruments, the energy of CRSF, Ecyc, has
recently been found to decay in Her X-1, which is one of the best-studied
accreting pulsars. We present our analysis of a homogeneous and almost
uninterrupted monitoring of the line energy with Swift/BAT. Methods: We
analyzed the archival Swift/BAT observations of Her X-1 from 2005 to 2014. The
data were used to measure the CRSF energy averaged over several months.
Results: The analysis confirms the long-term decay of the line energy. The
downward trend is highly significant and consistent with the trend measured
with the pointed observations: dEcyc/dt ~-0.3 keV per year. Conclusions: The
decay of Ecyc either indicates a local evolution of the magnetic field
structure in the polar regions of the neutron star or a geometrical
displacement of the line-forming region due to long-term changes in the
structure of the X-ray emitting region. The shortness of the observed timescale
of the decay, -Ecyc/(dEcyc/dt) ~ 100 yr, suggests that trend reversals and/or
jumps of the line energy might be observed in the future.

examined. We determined a total of 73 new energy levels, 58 from the STIS

the scattering mechanism responsible for spin relaxation. Within non-magnetic

thus the temperature dependence of the spin diffusion length might be inversely
proportional to resistivity. In lateral spin valves measurements have found
that at low temperatures the spin diffusion length unexpected decreases. By
measuring the transport properties of lateral Py/Cu/Py spin valves fabricated
with different purities of Cu, we extract a spin diffusion length which shows
this suppression below 30K only in the presence of the Kondo effect. We have
calculated the spin-relaxation rate and isolated the contributions from
magnetic impurities. We find the spin-flip probability of a magnetic impurity
to be 34%. Our semi-quantitative analysis demonstrates the dominant role of
Kondo scattering in spin relaxation, even in low concentrations of order 1
p.p.m., and hence accounts for the reduction in spin diffusion length observed

an essential resource for relevant quantum effects, such as quantum
teleportation, quantum cryptography, or the speed-up of quantum computing, as
in Shor's algorithm. However, up to now, there is no general characterization
of entanglement for many-body systems. In this sense, it is encouraging that
quantum states connected by stochastic local operations assisted with classical
communication (SLOCC), which perform probabilistically the same quantum tasks,
can be collected into entanglement classes. Nevertheless, there is an infinite
number of classes for four or more parties that may be gathered, in turn, into
a finite number of entanglement families. Unfortunately, we have not been able
to relate all classes and families to specific properties or quantum
information tasks, although a few of them have certainly raised experimental
interest. Here, we present a novel entanglement classification for quantum
states according to their matrix-product-state structure, exemplified for the
symmetric subspace. The proposed classification relates entanglement families
to the interaction length of Hamiltonians, establishing the first connection
between entanglement classification and condensed matter. Additionally, we
found a natural nesting property in which the families for $N$ parties carry
over to the $N+1$ case. We anticipate our proposal to be a starting point for
the exploration of the connection between entanglement classification
properties and condensed-matter models.

methods to probe fundamental excitations in solids. After the proposition of
Einstein's model, more than one century ago (Annalen der Physik \textbf{22},
180 (1907)), several theoretical models have been proposed to describe
experimental results. Here we report on a detailed analysis of the two-peak
specific heat anomalies observed in several materials. Employing a simple
multilevel model, varying the spacing between the energy levels $\Delta_i$ =
$(E_i$ $-$ $E_{0})$ and the degeneracy of each energy level $g_i$, we derive
the required conditions for the appearance of such anomalies. Our findings
indicate that a ratio of $\Delta_2$/$\Delta_1$ $\thickapprox$ 10 between the
energy levels and a high degeneracy of one of the energy levels define the
two-peaks regime in the specific heat. Our approach accurately matches recent
experimental results. Furthermore, using a mean-field approach we calculate the
specific heat of a degenerate Schottky-like system undergoing a ferromagnetic
(FM) phase transition. Our results reveal that as the degeneracy is increased
the Schottky maximum in the specific heat becomes narrow while the peak
associated with the FM transition remains unaffected.

directed networks. When the topology is deterministic, we establish the large
deviations principle and find exactly the corresponding rate function, equal at
all nodes. We show that the dependence of the rate function on the stochastic
weight matrix associated with the network is fully captured by its left
eigenvector corresponding to the unit eigenvalue. Further, when the sensors'
observations are Gaussian, the rate function admits a closed form expression.
Motivated by these observations, we formulate the optimal network design
problem of finding the left eigenvector which achieves the highest value of the
rate function, for a given target accuracy. This eigenvector therefore
minimizes the time that the inference algorithm needs to reach the desired
accuracy. For Gaussian observations, we show that the network design problem
can be formulated as a semidefinite (convex) program, and hence can be solved
efficiently. When observations are identically distributed across agents, the
system exhibits an interesting property: the graph of the rate function always
lies between the graphs of the rate function of an isolated node and the rate
function of a fusion center that has access to all observations. We prove that
this fundamental property holds even when the topology and the associated
system matrices change randomly over time, with arbitrary distribution. Due to
generality of its assumptions, the latter result requires more subtle
techniques than the standard large deviations tools, contributing to the
general theory of large deviations.

probe cosmological volumes out to high redshift. Intensity mapping survey
volumes also contain all other sources of radiation at the frequencies of
interest. Continuum foregrounds are typically ~10^2-10^3 times brighter than
the cosmological signal. The instrumental response to bright foregrounds will
produce new spectral degrees of freedom that are not known in advance, nor
necessarily spectrally smooth. The intrinsic spectra of foregrounds may also
not be well-known in advance. We describe a general class of quadratic
estimators to analyze data from single-dish intensity mapping experiments, and
determine contaminated spectral modes from the data itself. The key attribute
of foregrounds is not that they are spectrally smooth, but instead that they
have fewer bright spectral degrees of freedom than the cosmological signal.
Spurious correlations between the signal and foregrounds produce additional
bias. Compensation for signal attenuation must estimate and correct this bias.
A successful intensity mapping experiment will control instrumental systematics
that spread variance into new modes, and it must observe a large enough volume

accumulates a phase of ${\pi}L{/}{\lambda}$, which is a factor of two different

RADYN flare model was allowed to evolve for 110 seconds, after which the
electron beam heating was ended, and was then allowed to continue evolving for
a further 300s. The modelled flare parameters were compared to the observed
parameters determined from extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy. The model produced
a hotter and denser flare loop than that observed and also cooled more rapidly,
suggesting that additional energy input in the decay phase of the flare is
required. In the explosive evaporation phase a region of high-density cool
material propagated upward through the corona. This material underwent a rapid
increase in temperature as it was unable to radiate away all of the energy
deposited across it by the non-thermal electron beam and via thermal
conduction. A narrow and high-density ($n_{e} \le 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$) region at
the base of the flare transition region was the source of optical line emission
in the model atmosphere. The collision-stopping depth of electrons was
calculated throughout the evolution of the flare, and it was found that the

applied to one of the most recent Cavendish-type gravitational force
experiments, which showed a significant deviation of the measured gravitational
constant from the current CODATA value. A remarkable agreement between the

of an unknown signal over Nakagami-$m$ fading is revisited. Specifically, an
analytical expression for the local probability of detection is derived, while
using the approach of ED at the individual secondary user (SU), a new fusion
rule, based on the likelihood ratio test, is presented. The channels between
the primary user to SUs and SUs to fusion center are considered to be
independent Nakagami-$m$. The proposed fusion rule uses the channel statistics,
instead of the instantaneous channel state information, and is based on the
Neyman-Pearson criteria. Closed-form solutions for the system-level probability
of detection and probability of false alarm are also derived. Furthermore, a
closed-form expression for the optimal number of cooperative SUs, needed to
minimize the total error rate, is presented. The usefulness of factor graph and
sum-product-algorithm models for computing likelihoods, is also discussed to
highlight its advantage, in terms of computational cost. The performance of the
proposed schemes have been evaluated both by analysis and simulations. Results
show that the proposed rules perform well over a wide range of the
signal-to-noise ratio.

methods to quantify the long-term correlations in nonstationary time series.
Many long-term correlated time series in real systems contain various trends.
We investigate the effects of polynomial trends on the scaling behaviors and
the performances of three widely used DMA methods including backward algorithm
(BDMA), centered algorithm (CDMA) and forward algorithm (FDMA). We derive a
general framework for polynomial trends and obtain analytical results for
constant shifts and linear trends. We find that the behavior of the CDMA method
is not influenced by constant shifts. In contrast, linear trends cause a
crossover in the CDMA fluctuation functions. We also find that constant shifts
and linear trends cause crossovers in the fluctuation functions obtained from
the BDMA and FDMA methods. When a crossover exists, the scaling behavior at
small scales comes from the intrinsic time series while that at large scales is
dominated by the constant shifts or linear trends. We also derive analytically
the expressions of crossover scales and show that the crossover scale depends
on the strength of the polynomial trend, the Hurst index, and in some cases
(linear trends for BDMA and FDMA) the length of the time series. In all cases,
the BDMA and the FDMA behave almost the same under the influence of constant
shifts or linear trends. Extensive numerical experiments confirm excellently
the analytical derivations. We conclude that the CDMA method outperforms the
BDMA and FDMA methods in the presence of polynomial trends.

then it is well known that $\dim S^k\leq k$. In complete generality nothing
else is known about the singular sets $S^k(I)$. In this paper we prove for a
general integral varifold with bounded mean curvature, in particular a
stationary varifold, that every stratum $S^k(I)$ is $k$-rectifiable. In fact,
we prove for $k$-a.e. point $x\in S^k$ that there exists a unique $k$-plane
$V^k$ such that every tangent cone at $x$ is of the form $V\times C$ for some
cone $C$.
  In the case of minimizing hypersurfaces $I^{n-1}\subseteq M^n$ we can go
further. Indeed, we can show that the singular set $S(I)$, which is known to
satisfy $\dim S(I)\leq n-8$, is in fact $n-8$ rectifiable with uniformly finite
$n-8$ measure. An effective version of this allows us to prove that the second
fundamental form $A$ has apriori estimates in $L^7_{weak}$ on $I$, an estimate
which is sharp as $|A|$ is not in $L^7$ for the Simons cone. In fact, we prove
the much stronger estimate that the regularity scale $r_I$ has
$L^7_{weak}$-estimates.
  The above results are in fact just applications of a new class of estimates
we prove on the quantitative stratifications $S^k_{\epsilon,r}$ and
$S^k_{\epsilon}\equiv S^k_{\epsilon,0}$. Roughly, $x\in S^k_{\epsilon}\subseteq
I$ if no ball $B_r(x)$ is $\epsilon$-close to being $k+1$-symmetric. We show
that $S^k_\epsilon$ is $k$-rectifiable and satisfies the Minkowski estimate
$Vol(B_r\,S_\epsilon^k)\leq C_\epsilon r^{n-k}$. The proof requires a new
$L^2$-subspace approximation theorem for integral varifolds with bounded mean
curvature, and a $W^{1,p}$-Reifenberg type theorem proved by the authors in
\cite{NaVa+}.
