in $\mathcal{H}$ bounded by two dilated images of $\mathcal{S}$, with dilation

of the collision moments, the transport equations for the new variables are
identical to the usual moment equations, and thus naturally lend themselves to
the variety of already existing closure methods. Under the anelastic turbulence
approximation, we derive equations for the Reynolds-averaged turbulent
fluctuations around the coarse-grained state. We show that the global relative
entropy of the coarse-grained state is bounded from above by the Reynolds
average of the fine-grained global relative entropy, and thus obeys the time
decay bound of Desvillettes and Villani. This is similar to what is observed in
the rarefied gas dynamics, which makes the Grad moment closure a good candidate
for truncating the hierarchy of the coarse-grained moment equations. We also
show that, under additional assumptions on the form of the coarse-grained
collision terms, one arrives at the Navier-Stokes closure, which can be
naturally extended to the Burnett and super-Burnett orders. Finally, we suggest
crude parameterizations of the coarse-grained collision terms for use as

decision processes, by reducing them to a minimal sequence of cumulative reward
problems. The usual solution methods for this type of problems update the gain
(optimal average reward) immediately after observing the result of taking an
action. The alternative introduced, optimal nudging, relies instead on setting
the gain to some fixed value, which transitorily makes the problem a
cumulative-reward task, solving it by any standard reinforcement learning
method, and only then updating the gain in a way that minimizes uncertainty in
a minmax sense. The rule for optimal gain update is derived by exploiting the
geometric features of the w-l space, a simple mapping of the space of policies.
The total number of cumulative reward tasks that need to be solved is shown to
be small. Some experiments are presented to explore the features of the
algorithm and to compare its performance with other approaches.

many natural and industrial processes. The properties of greatest practical
interest are density, solubility, and enthalpy. Many models for density and
solubility calculations have been presented in the literature, but there exists
only one study, by Spycher and Pruess, that has compared theoretical molar
enthalpy predictions with experimental data. In this report, we recommend two
different models for enthalpy calculations: the CPA equation of state by Li and
Firoozabadi, and the CO$_2$ activity coefficient model by Duan and Sun. We show
that the CPA equation of state, which has been demonstrated to provide good
agreement with density and solubility data, also accurately calculates molar
enthalpies of pure CO$_2$, pure water, and both CO$_2$-rich and aqueous
(H$_2$O-rich) mixtures of the two species. It is applicable to a wider range of
conditions than the Spycher and Pruess model. In aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl)
mixtures, we show that Duan and Sun's model yields accurate results for the
partial molar enthalpy of CO$_2$. It can be combined with another model for the
brine enthalpy to calculate the molar enthalpy of H$_2$O-CO$_2$-NaCl mixtures.
We conclude by explaining how the CPA equation of state may be modified to
further improve agreement with experiments. This generalized CPA is the basis
of our future work on this topic.

of the Milky Way bulge is not a classical bulge made by previous major mergers,
instead it appears to be a bar seen somewhat end-on. The Milky Way bar can form
naturally from a precursor disk and thicken vertically by the internal
firehose/buckling instability, giving rise to the boxy appearance. This picture
is supported by many lines of evidence, including the asymmetric parallelogram
shape, the strong cylindrical rotation (i.e., nearly constant rotation
regardless of the height above the disk plane), the existence of an intriguing

distribution of network configurations. This model provides a viable
alternative to existing models that propose convergence of parameters to
maximum likelihood values. It explains how priors on weight distributions and
connection probabilities can be merged optimally with learned experience, how
cortical networks can generalize learned information so well to novel

explains from a functional perspective a number of experimental data on

case n = 3 corresponds to the Bloch ball of quantum theory). We show that a

introduce a bipartite extension of such theories for which there exist dense
coding protocols such that log_2 (n+1) bits are communicated if entanglement is
previously shared by the communicating parties. For n > 3, these protocols are
more powerful than the quantum one, because more than two bits are communicated
by transmission of a system that locally encodes at most one bit. We call this
phenomenon hyperdense coding. Our hyperdense coding protocols imply
superadditive classical capacities: two entangled systems can encode log_2
(n+1) > 2 bits, even though each system individually encodes at most one bit.
In our examples, hyperdense coding and superadditivity of classical capacities
come at the expense of violating tomographic locality or dynamical continuous

states of the quantum Hall exciton condensate in electron-electron bilayers,
existence of the counterpropagating edge modes results in formation of a ground
state spin-texture not supporting gapless single-particle excitations. This
feature has deep consequences for the low energy behavior of the system.
Namely, the charged edge excitations in a sufficiently narrow Hall bar are
confined, i.e.~a charge on one of the edges always gives rise to an opposite
charge on the other edge. Moreover, we show that magnetic field and gate
voltages allow to control confinement-deconfinement transition of charged edge
excitations, which can be probed with nonlocal conductance.
Confinement-deconfinement transitions are of great interest, not least because
of their possible significance in shedding light on the confinement problem of
quarks.

reversible gates acting on bits, in terms of which reversible transformations

classification can be seen as the reversible-computing analogue of Post's
lattice, a central result in mathematical logic from the 1940s. It is a step
toward the ambitious goal of classifying all possible quantum gate sets acting
on qubits. Our theorem implies a linear-time algorithm (which we have
implemented), that takes as input the truth tables of reversible gates G and H,
and that decides whether G generates H. Previously, this problem was not even
known to be decidable. The theorem also implies that any n-bit reversible
circuit can be ""compressed"" to an equivalent circuit, over the same gates, that
uses at most 2^n*poly(n) gates and O(1) ancilla bits; these are the first upper
bounds on these quantities known, and are close to optimal. Finally, the
theorem implies that every non-degenerate reversible gate can implement either
every reversible transformation, or every affine transformation, when
restricted to an ""encoded subspace."" Briefly, the theorem says that every set
of reversible gates generates either all reversible transformations on n-bit
strings (as the Toffoli gate does); no transformations; all transformations
that preserve Hamming weight (as the Fredkin gate does); all transformations
that preserve Hamming weight mod k for some k; all affine transformations (as
the Controlled-NOT gate does); all affine transformations that preserve Hamming
weight mod 2 or mod 4, inner products mod 2, or a combination thereof; or a

several Standard Model and New Physics processes. Most analyses rely on the

splitting and do not involve any non-perturbative degrees of freedom. It is
clearly necessary to test this hypothesis with suitable QCD processes.
Conversely, a non-perturbative, intrinsic heavy quark parton distribution has
been predicted in the literature. We demonstrate that to a very good
approximation the scale-evolution of the intrinsic heavy quark content of the
nucleon is governed by non-singlet evolution equations. This allows us to
analyze the intrinsic heavy quark distributions without having to resort to a
full-fledged global analysis of parton distribution functions. We exploit this
freedom to model intrinsic bottom distributions which are so far missing in the
literature in order to estimate the impact of this non-perturbative
contribution to the bottom-quark PDF, and on parton--parton luminosities at the

collapse of $N$ atoms into a definite state (for example spin up or down) leads
to an uncertainty $\Delta \theta_{SQL}=1/\sqrt{N}$ in the estimate of the
quantum phase accumulated during a Ramsey sequence or its many generalizations.
This phase uncertainty is referred to as the standard quantum limit. Creating
quantum entanglement between the $N$ atoms can allow the atoms to partially
cancel each other's quantum noise, leading to reduced noise in the phase
estimate below the standard quantum limit. Recent experiments have demonstrated
up to $10$~dB of phase noise reduction relative to the SQL by making collective
spin measurements. This is achieved by trapping laser-cooled Rb atoms in an
optical cavity and precisely measuring the shift of the cavity resonance
frequency by an amount that depends on the number of atoms in spin up.
Detecting the probe light with high total efficiency reduces excess classical
and quantum back-action of the probe. Here we discuss recent progress and a
technique for reducing the relative frequency noise between the probe light and
the optical cavity, a key requirement for further advances.

size, and this phenomenon is not captured. A better approximation for eccentric
orbits is provided by p-ellipse curves (Struck 2006), which do exhibit this
effect. Here the p-ellipse approximation and precession-eccentricity relation
are used as tools for finding the resonant radii generated from various
Lindblad parent resonances. Simple, idealized examples, in flat rotation curve
and near solid-body discs, are used to show that ensembles of eccentric
resonant orbits excited in Lindblad Zones can provide a backbone for generating
a variety of (kinematic) bars and spiral waves. In cases balancing
radius-dependent circular frequencies and eccentricity-dependent precession, a
range of resonant orbits can maintain their form in the pattern frame, and do
not wind up. Eccentric resonance orbits require a strong perturbation to excite
them, and may be produced mostly in galaxy interactions or by strong internal
disturbances.

set on model parameters within supersymmetric scenarios involving R-parity
violation, split supersymmetry, and gauge mediation. In some of the search
channels, the trigger and search strategy are based only on the decay products
of individual long-lived particles, irrespective of the rest of the event. In
these cases, the provided limits can easily be reinterpreted in different
scenarios.

  In this work, we study through a thorough quantitative analysis how different
conspiracy topics are consumed in the Italian Facebook. By means of a
semi-automatic topic extraction strategy, we show that the most discussed
contents semantically refer to four specific categories: {\em environment},
{\em diet}, {\em health}, and {\em geopolitics}. We find similar patterns by
comparing users activity (likes and comments) on posts belonging to different
semantic categories. However, if we focus on the lifetime -- i.e., the distance
in time between the first and the last comment for each user -- we notice a
remarkable difference within narratives -- e.g., users polarized on geopolitics
are more persistent in commenting, whereas the less persistent are those
focused on diet related topics. Finally, we model users mobility across various
topics finding that the more a user is active, the more he is likely to join
all topics. Once inside a conspiracy narrative users tend to embrace the
overall corpus.

The effect is related to the possibility of having topologically inequivalent

  A CFT state which is expected to describe the eternal AdS black hole in the
large N limit is discussed. It is argued under certain assumptions that the
black hole boundary should be merely a patch of the entire AdS boundary. This
leads then to a conclusion that that CFT state is the ordinary CFT vacuum
restricted to that patch. If existent, the bulk CFT operators can behave as the
ordinary semi- classical quantum field theory in the large N limit in the weak

opportunity to characterize surface roughness and the dielectric properties of
their surfaces, as well as potentially explore some of their shallow subsurface
physical properties. If the dielectric and topographic properties of asteroid's
surfaces are defined, one can constrain their surface textural characteristics
as well as potential subsurface volatile enrichment using the observed radar
backscatter. To achieve this objective, we establish the first dielectric model
of asteroid Vesta for the case of a dry, volatile-poor regolith--employing an
analogy to the dielectric properties of lunar soil, and adjusted for the
surface densities and temperatures deduced from Dawn's Visible and InfraRed
mapping spectrometer (VIR). Our model suggests that the real part of the
dielectric constant at the surface of Vesta is relatively constant, ranging
from 2.3 to 2.5 from the night- to day-side of Vesta, while the loss tangent
shows slight variation as a function of diurnal temperature, ranging from 0.006
to 0.008. We estimate the surface porosity to be ~55% in the upper meter of the
regolith, as derived from VIR observations. This is ~12% higher than previous
estimation of porosity derived from previous Earth-based X- and S-band radar
observation. We suggest that the radar backscattering properties of asteroid
Vesta will be mainly driven by the changes in surface roughness rather than
potential dielectric variations in the upper regolith in the X- and S-band.

of jet suppression and modifications of jet fragmentation functions in Pb+Pb
collisions at the LHC. Particular emphasis is placed on the impact of the
differences between quark and gluon jet quenching on the transverse momentum
($p_{T}^{jet}$) dependence of the jet $R_{AA}$ and on the fragmentation
functions, $D(z)$. Primordial quark and gluon parton distributions were
obtained from PYTHIA8 and were parameterized using simple power-law functions
and extensions to the power-law function which were found to better describe
the PYTHIA8 parton spectra. A simple model for the quark energy loss based on
the shift formalism is used to model $R_{AA}$ and $D(z)$ using both analytic
results and using direct Monte-Carlo sampling of the PYTHIA parton spectra. The
model is capable of describing the full $p_{T}^{jet}$ , rapidity, and
centrality dependence of the measured jet $R_{AA}$ using three effective
parameters. A key result from the analysis is that the $D(z)$ modifications
observed in the data, excluding the enhancement at low-$z$, may result
primarily from the different quenching of the quarks and gluons. The model is
also capable of reproducing the charged hadron $R_{AA}$ at high transverse
momentum. Predictions are made for the jet $R_{AA}$ at large rapidities where
it has not yet been measured and for the rapidity dependence of $D(z)$.

$\sigma + k \rho$ on the total power of any $k\geq 1$ consecutive transmitted
symbols. Such a channel has infinite memory and evaluating its exact capacity
is a difficult task. Consequently, we establish an $n$-letter capacity
expression and seek bounds for the same. We obtain a lower bound on capacity by
considering the volume of ${\cal S}_n(\sigma, \rho) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$,
which is the set of all length $n$ sequences satisfying the $(\sigma,
\rho)$-power constraints. For a noise power of $\nu$, we obtain an upper bound
on capacity by considering the volume of ${\cal S}_n(\sigma, \rho) \oplus
B_n(\sqrt{n\nu})$, which is the Minkowski sum of ${\cal S}_n(\sigma, \rho)$ and
the $n$-dimensional Euclidean ball of radius $\sqrt{n\nu}$. We analyze this
bound using a result from convex geometry known as Steiner's formula, which
gives the volume of this Minkowski sum in terms of the intrinsic volumes of
${\cal S}_n(\sigma, \rho)$. We show that as the dimension $n$ increases, the
logarithm of the sequence of intrinsic volumes of $\{{\cal S}_n(\sigma,
\rho)\}$ converges to a limit function under an appropriate scaling. The upper
bound on capacity is then expressed in terms of this limit function. We derive
the asymptotic capacity in the low and high noise regime for the $(\sigma,

proportional to the baryon density, for arbitrary solutions. We further find
that, in the mean-field approximation, the BPS Skyrme model approaches the
Walecka model in the limit of high density - their thermodynamical functions as
well as the equation of state agree in this limit. This fact allows to read off
some properties of the $\omega$-meson from the BPS Skyrme action, even though
the latter model is entirely based on the (pionic) $SU(2)$ Skyrme field. On the
other hand, at low densities, at the order of the usual nuclear matter density,
the equations of state of the two models are no longer universal, such that a
comparison depends on some model details. Still, also the BPS Skyrme model
gives rise to nuclear saturation in this regime, leading, in fact, to an exact
balance between repulsive and attractive forces. The perfect fluid aspects of
the BPS Skyrme model, which, together with its BPS properties, form the base of

study early structure formation in a cosmological model with a blue-tilted PPS.
We assume that the standard scale-invariant PPS is modified at small length
scales as $P(k) \sim k^{m_{\rm s}}$ with $m_{\rm s} > 1$. We run a series of
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to examine the dependence of the
formation epoch and the characteristic mass of primordial stars on the tilt of
the PPS. In models with $m_{\rm s} > 1$, star-forming gas clouds are formed at
$z > 100$, when formation of hydrogen molecules is inefficient because the
intense CMB radiation destroys chemical intermediates. Without efficient
coolant, the gas clouds gravitationally contract while keeping a high
temperature. The protostars formed in such ""hot"" clouds grow very rapidly by
accretion to become extremely massive stars that may leave massive black holes
with a few hundred solar-masses at $z > 100$. The shape of the PPS critically
affects the properties and the formation epoch of the first generation of
stars. Future experiments of the CMB polarization and the spectrum distortion
may provide important information on the nature of the first stars and their
formation epoch, and hence on the shape of the small-scale power spectrum.

galaxies orbiting the Andromeda galaxy are surprisingly aligned in a thin,
extended and kinematically coherent planar structure. The presence of such a
structure seems to challenge the current Cold Dark Matter paradigm of structure
formation, which predicts a more uniform distribution of satellites around
central objects. We show that it is possible to obtain a thin, extended,
rotating plane of satellites resembling the one in Andromeda in cosmological
collisionless simulations based on the Cold Dark Matter model. Our new high
resolution simulations show a correlation between the formation time of the
dark matter halo and the thickness of the plane of satellites. Our simulations
have a high incidence of satellite planes as thin, extended, and as rich as the
one in Andromeda and with a very coherent kinematic structure when we select
high concentration/early forming halos. By tracking the formation of the
satellites in the plane we show that they have been mainly accreted onto the
main object along thin dark matter filaments at high redshift. Our results show
that the presence of a thin, extended, rotating plane of satellites is not a
challenge for the Cold Dark Matter paradigm, but actually supports one of the
predictions of this paradigm related to the presence of filaments of dark
matter around galaxies at high redshift.

does not trigger core convection, but rather leads to a centrally concentrated

quantum dynamics of an electron on a one dimensional lattice in the presence of
an incommensurate potential with magnitude $V$ and wave number $Q$. It has been
proven that all states are delocalized if $V$ is less than a critical value
$V_c=2t$ and localized if $V> V_c$. Here, we show that this result (while
correct) is highly misleading, at least in the small $Q$ limit. In particular,
for $V<V_c$ there is an abrupt crossover akin to a mobility edge at an energy
$E_c$; states with energy $|E|<E_c$ are robustly delocalized, but those in the
tails of the density of states, with $|E|>E_c$, form a set of narrow bands with
exponentially small bandwidths $ \sim t\ \exp[-(2\pi\alpha/Q)]$ (where $\alpha$
is an energy dependent number of order 1) separated by band-gaps $ \sim t Q$.
Thus, the states with $|E|> E_c$ are ""almost localized"" in that they have an
exponentially large effective mass and are easily localized by small
perturbations. We establish this both using exact numerical solution of the
problem, and by exploiting the well known fact that the same eigenvalue problem
arises in the Hofstadter problem of an electron moving on a 2D lattice in the
presence of a magnetic field, $B=Q/2\pi$. From the 2D perspective, the almost
localized states are simply the Landau levels associated with semiclassical
precession around closed contours of constant quasiparticle energy; that they
are not truly localized reflects an extremely subtle form of magnetic
breakdown.

velocity components within the ambient gas. The (1-0) transitions reveal a
radial velocity gradient across B1-E of 1 km/s/pc that increases from
north-west to south-east, whereas the majority of the Perseus cloud has a
radial velocity gradient increasing from south-west to north-east. In contrast,
we see no evidence of a velocity gradient associated with the denser
Herschel-identified substructures in B1-E. Additionally, the denser
substructures have much lower systemic motions than the ambient clump material,
which indicates that they are likely decoupled from the large-scale gas.
Nevertheless, these substructures themselves have broad line widths (0.4 km/s)
similar to that of the C18O gas in the clump, which suggests they inherited
their kinematic properties from the larger-scale, moderately dense gas.
Finally, we find evidence of C18O depletion only toward one substructure,
B1-E2, which is also the only object with narrow (transonic) line widths. We
suggest that as prestellar cores form, their chemical and kinematic properties

heating. We examine radii ~0.1-100 pc around a black hole (BH), where the
accretion rate onto the BH is determined and where AGN-powered winds and
radiation couple to the ISM. We conclude: (1) The BH accretion rate is
determined by exchange of angular momentum between gas and stars in
gravitational instabilities. This produces accretion rates ~0.03-1 Msun/yr,
sufficient to power luminous AGN. (2) The gas disk in the galactic nucleus
undergoes an initial burst of star formation followed by several Myrs where
stellar feedback suppresses the star formation rate (SFR). (3) AGN winds
injected at small radii with momentum fluxes ~L/c couple efficiently to the ISM
and have dramatic effects on ISM properties within ~100 pc. AGN winds suppress
the nuclear SFR by factors ~10-30 and BH accretion rate by factors ~3-30. They
increase the outflow rate from the nucleus by factors ~10, consistent with
observational evidence for galaxy-scale AGN-driven outflows. (4) With AGN
feedback, the predicted column density distribution to the BH is consistent
with observations. Absent AGN feedback, the BH is isotropically obscured and
there are not enough optically-thin sightlines to explain Type-I AGN. A
'torus-like' geometry arises self-consistently as AGN feedback evacuates gas in
polar regions.

origin of gamma-ray emission from distant sources. Cosmic lenses magnify the
emission from distance sources and produce time delays between mirage images.
Gravitationally-induced time delays depend on the position of the emitting
regions in the source plane. The Fermi/LAT satellite continuously monitors the
entire sky and detects gamma-ray flares, including those from
gravitationally-lensed blazars. Therefore, temporal resolution at gamma-ray
energies can be used to measure these time delays, which, in turn, can be used
to resolve the origin of the gamma-ray flares spatially. We provide a guide to
the application and Monte Carlo simulation of three techniques for analyzing
these unresolved light curves: the Autocorrelation Function, the Double Power
Spectrum, and the Maximum Peak Method. We apply these methods to derive time
delays from the gamma-ray light curve of the gravitationally-lensed blazar PKS
1830-211. The result of temporal analysis combined with the properties of the
lens from radio observations yield an improvement in spatial resolution at
gamma-ray energies by a factor of 10000. We analyze four active periods. For
two of these periods, the emission is consistent with origination from the core
and for the other two, the data suggest that the emission region is displaced
from the core by more that ~1.5 kpc. For the core emission, the gamma-ray time
delays, $23\pm0.5$ days and $19.7\pm1.2$ days, are consistent with the radio
time delay $26^{+4}_{-5}$ days.

may have been the consequence of a pre-inflationary process of decoherence as
in the quantum cosmology literature. Mathematically they are essentially
identical calculations. However if one takes the latter interpretation then one
might replace the Planck length by for instance the fundamental length scale of
string theory. In particular this changes the relation between the scale of
inflation and the scalar power spectrum but leaves the parameter(s)
characterizing the bi-spectrum unchanged at leading order. Differences will
occur however at higher order in the loop expansion. We also discuss the
relation to theories with low sound speed and/or a period of dissipation during

the real part of the electron self energy $\Re \Sigma(\omega) \sim \eta/\omega$
at low frequency, where $\eta$ can be considered as the 'order parameter' for
Mott insulating state, QPIs are completely washed out at the small bias
voltage. However, a further analysis shows that $\Re \Sigma(\omega)$ in fact
serves as an energy-dependent chemical potential shift. As a result, the
effective bias voltage seen by the system is $eV' = eV - \Re \Sigma(eV)$. Due
to the singular behavior of $\Re \Sigma(\omega)$, a critical bias voltage $eV_c

strongly dependent on the Higgs width, potentially allowing for a measurement

60 MeV in the Standard Model.

sequentially. Each agent receives a private signal about the underlying state
of the world, observes the past actions in a neighborhood of individuals, and
chooses her action attempting to match the true state. Earlier research in this
field emphasizes that herding behavior occurs with a positive probability in
certain special cases; recent studies show that asymptotic learning is
achievable under a more general observation structure. In particular, with
unbounded private beliefs, asymptotic learning occurs if and only if agents
observe a close predecessor, i.e., the action of a close predecessor reveals
the true state in the limit. However, a prevailing assumption in these studies
is that the observation structure in the society is exogenous. In contrast to
most of the previous literature, I assume in this paper that observation is
endogenous and costly. More specifically, each agent must pay a specific cost
to make any observation and can strategically choose the set of actions to
observe privately. I introduce the notion of maximal learning (relative to
cost) as a natural extension of asymptotic learning: society achieves maximal
learning when agents can learn the true state with probability 1 in the limit
after paying the cost of observation. I show that observing only a close
predecessor is no longer sufficient for learning the true state with unbounded
private beliefs and positive costs. Instead, maximal learning occurs if and
only if the size of the observations extends to infinity. I provide interesting
comparative statics as to how various settings in the model affect the learning
probability. For instance, the probability to learn the true state may be
higher under positive costs than under zero cost; in addition, the probability
to learn the true state may be higher under weaker private signals.

evacuated cavity from 175 AU inwards. Compared to the previous HST imaging with
relatively large coronagraphic inner working angles (IWA), the NICI coronagraph
allows imaging down to an IWA of 0.3"". Thus, the inner edge of the inner

structures within 175 AU. We note some additional asymmetries in this system.
Specifically, while the outer ring structure looks circular in this

a single deprojection angle is not appropriate for this system and that there
may be an offset in inclination between the two ring / spiral features. We find
an offset of 4+-2 AU between the inner ring and the star center, potentially
pointing to unseen inner companions.

bounds for matrix completion are nearly optimal up to a factor on the order of

for compressed sensing for sparse vectors with Poisson noise and for analyzing
low-rank matrices, as well as adapting the arguments used for one-bit matrix

nature) and the adaptation requires new techniques exploiting properties of the
Poisson likelihood function and tackling the difficulties posed by the locally
sub-Gaussian characteristic of the Poisson distribution. Our results highlight
a few important distinctions of the Poisson case compared to the prior work

of Holsapple and Housen (2007) and models the ejecta expansion following an
impact as occurring in discrete shells each with their own velocity. We
estimate the magnitude change between a series of target/impactor pairs,
assuming it is given by the increase in reflecting surface area within a
photometric aperture due to the resulting ejecta. As expected the photometric
signal increases with impactor size, but we find also that the photometric
signature decreases rapidly as the target asteroid diameter increases, due to
gravitational fallback. We have used the model results to make an estimate of
the impactor diameter for the (596) Scheila collision of D=49-65m depending on
the impactor taxonomy, which is broadly consistent with previous estimates. We
varied both the strength regime (highly porous and sand/cohesive soil) and the
taxonomic type (S-, C- and D-type) to examine the effect on the magnitude
change, finding that it is significant at early stages but has only a small
effect on the overall lifetime of the photometric signal. Combining the results
of this model with the collision frequency estimates of Bottke et al. (2005),

be insensitive to impacts on asteroids with D<20km if relying on photometric

metallicity, though different modeling methods disagree as to the magnitude,
wavelength dependence, and even the sign of the effect. The outer density
structure, ^56 Ni, and to a lesser degree asphericity, also impact the UV. We
compute synthetic photometry of various metallicity-dependent models and
compare to UV/optical photometry from the Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope.
We find that the scatter in the mid-UV to near-UV colors is larger than
predicted by changes in metallicity alone and is not consistent with reddening.
We demonstrate that a recently employed method to determine relative abundances
using UV spectra can be done using UVOT photometry, but we warn that accurate
results require an accurate model of the cause of the variations. The abundance
of UV photometry now available should provide constraints on models that
typically rely on UV spectroscopy for constraining metallicity, density, and
other parameters. Nevertheless, UV spectroscopy for a variety of SN explosions
is still needed to guide the creation of accurate models. A better
understanding of the influences affecting the UV is important for using SNe Ia

$O(M(n\log n) + P(n))$, where $M(n)$ is the time to multiply two $n$-bit
numbers, and $P(n)$ is the time to compute a prime table up to $n$. The fastest
algorithm to compute $\binom{n}{n/2}$ also uses a prime table. We show that it
takes time $O(M(n) + P(n))$.
  In various models, the best bound on $P(n)$ is greater than $M(n\log n)$,
given advances in the complexity of multiplication \cite{Furer07,De08}. In this
paper, we give two algorithms to computing prime tables and analyze their
complexity on a multitape Turing machine, one of the standard models for
analyzing such algorithms. These two algorithms run in time $O(M(n\log n))$ and
$O(n\log^2 n/\log \log n)$, respectively. We achieve our results by speeding up
Atkin's sieve.
  Given that the current best bound on $M(n)$ is $n\log n 2^{O(\log^*n)}$, the
second algorithm is faster and improves on the previous best algorithm by a
factor of $\log^2\log n$. Our fast prime-table algorithms speed up both the
computation of $n!$ and $\binom{n}{n/2}$.

suspected companion of more than one solar mass suggests that it is a massive
white dwarf, a neutron star or even a black hole. We found that the semi-major
axes of the proposed orbits are between 1 and 20 au. Because the studied stars
belong to the closest RR Lyraes, maximal angular distances between components
during orbit should at least be between 1 and 13 mas and this improves the
chance to detect both stars using current telescopes. However, our
interpretation of the O-C diagrams as a consequence of the LiTE should be
considered as preliminary without reliable spectroscopic measurements. On the
other hand our models give a prediction of the period and radial velocity
evolution which should be sufficient for plausible proof of binarity.

a nonlinear medium to produce new field frequencies, is ubiquitous in modern
photonic systems. However, the nonlinear electric susceptibilities that give
rise to such phenomena are often challenging to tune in a given material, and
so far, dynamical control of optical nonlinearities remains confined to
research labs as a spectroscopic tool. Here, we report a mechanism to
electrically control second-order optical nonlinearities in monolayer WSe2, an
atomically thin semiconductor. We show that the intensity of second-harmonic
generation at the A-exciton resonance is tunable by over an order of magnitude
at low temperature and nearly a factor of 4 at room temperature through
electrostatic doping in a field-effect transistor. Such tunability arises from
the strong exciton charging effects in monolayer semiconductors, which allow
for exceptional control over the oscillator strengths at the exciton and trion
resonances. The exciton-enhanced second-harmonic generation is
counter-circularly polarized to the excitation laser, arising from the
combination of the two-photon and one-photon valley selection rules that have
opposite helicity in the monolayer. Our study paves the way towards a new
platform for chip-scale, electrically tunable nonlinear optical devices based
on two-dimensional semiconductors.

facilitate follow-up studies to characterize the properties of M dwarfs and

populations in the physical separation distribution, supporting earlier
findings. We suggest that wide binaries are comprised of multiple populations,
most likely representing different formation modes. There are 141 M7 or later
wide binary candidates, representing a 7-fold increase in the number currently
known. These binaries are too wide to have been formed via the ejection
mechanism. Finally, we find that ~6% of spectroscopically confirmed M dwarfs

the spatial resolution of the IRAC observations at the level of 2 arcseconds,
the lensing features of a background DSFG in the near-infrared are blended with
the flux from the foreground lensing galaxy in the IRAC imaging data. We make
use of higher resolution Hubble/WFC3 or Keck/NIRC2 Adaptive Optics imaging data
to fit light profiles of the foreground lensing galaxy (or galaxies) as a way
to model the foreground components, in order to successfully disentangle the
foreground lens and background source flux densities in the IRAC images. The

masses in the range 8 x 10^10 to 4 x 10^11 Msun and star-formation rates of
around 100 Msun yr-1. This puts these lensed sub-millimeter systems well above

investigate exhaustively the possibilities and subtle differences in defining
such a quantum indistinguishability notion for symmetric-key encryption
schemes. We justify our stronger definition by showing its equivalence to novel
quantum semantic-security notions that we introduce. Furthermore, we show that
our new security definitions cannot be achieved by a large class of ciphers --
those which are quasi-preserving the message length. On the other hand, we
provide a secure construction based on quantum-resistant pseudorandom
permutations; this construction can be used as a generic transformation for
turning a large class of encryption schemes into quantum indistinguishable and
hence quantum semantically secure ones. Moreover, our construction is the first
completely classical encryption scheme shown to be secure against an even
stronger notion of indistinguishability, which was previously known to be
achievable only by using quantum messages and arbitrary quantum encryption
circuits.

To characterize the properties of the ALMA sources, we introduce and make use
of uvmcmcfit, a publicly available Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis tool for

favor intrinsic number counts for DSFGs with a steep fall off above 8mJy at

each other than expected based on results from theoretical models as well as
fainter DSFGs identified in the LABOCA ECDFS Submillimeter Survey. The high
multiplicity rate and low projected separations argue in favor of interactions

investigations of epidemiol- ogy, in-host disease, and autoimmunity. These
closely related models display interesting dynamical behaviors including
bistability, recurrence, and regular oscillations, each of which has possible
clinical or public health implications. In this contribution we elucidate the
key role of backward bifurcation in the parameter regimes leading to the
behaviors of interest. We demonstrate that backward bifurcation facilitates the
appearance of Hopf bifurcations, and the varied dynamical behaviors are then
determined by the properties of the Hopf bifurcation(s), including their
location and direction. A Maple program devel- oped earlier is implemented to
determine the stability of limit cycles bifurcating from the Hopf bifurcation.
Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate phenomena of interest such as
bistability, recurrence and oscillation. We also discuss the physical
motivations for the models and the clinical implications of the resulting
dynamics.

based on the subject vertical conflict (SVC) theory. We expand this model to
6-DOF motion, including head rotation, by introducing the otolith-canal
interaction. Then the model is applied to an analysis of passengers' comfort.
It is known that the driver is less susceptible to motion sickness than are the
passengers. In addition, it is known that the driver tilts his/her head toward
the curve direction when curve driving, whereas the passengers' head movement
is likely to occur in the opposite direction. Thus, the effect of the head tilt
strategy on motion sickness was investigated by the proposed mathematical
model. The head movements of drivers and passengers were measured in slalom
driving. Then, the MSI of the drivers and that of the passengers predicted by
the proposed model were compared. The results revealed that the head movement
toward the centripetal direction has a significant effect in reducing the MSI
in the sense of SVC theory.

$S^{(n-1)}$ locally flatly in an $n$ sphere $S^{n}$, then it decomposes $S^{n}$
into two components. In addition, the embedded $S^{(n-1)}$ is the common
boundary of the two components and each component is homeomorphic to the
$n$-ball.\newline This paper gives a constructive proof of the theorem using
the discrete method. More specifically, we prove the equivalent statements: Let
$M$ be an $n$-manifold, which is homeomorphic to $S^{n}$. Then, every
$(n-1)$-manifold $S$, a submanifold with local flatness in $M$, decomposes the
space $M$ into two components where each component is homeomorphic to an
$n$-ball. The method was chosen in order to evaluate the computability and
computational costs among operations between cells regarding homeomorphism. In
addition, methods within the proof can be extended to applications in design
algorithms under the assumption that homeomorphic mappings are constructible
and computable. In this new revision, We add some new detailed discussions.

muon and neutron electric dipole moments, and time-reversal violation

future projects. For example, generalized parton distributions (GPDs) could be
investigated by using pion and proton beams, whereas they are studied by the
virtual Compton scattering at lepton facilities. The GPDs are key quantities
for determining the three-dimensional picture of hadrons and for finding the
origin of the nucleon spin including partonic orbital-angular-momentum

spin topics should be possible by using the high-momentum beamline. The
strangeness contribution to the nucleon spin could be also investigated in

in a privacy-aware way accordingly. Our protocol guarantees secure,

previous works, interference management approaches in HetNets are mainly based
on interference level, and thus cannot effectively utilize the limited resource
to improve network performance. In this paper, we propose a user-centric
interference nulling (IN) scheme in downlink two-tier HetNets to improve
network performance by improving each user's SIR. This scheme has three design
parameters: the maximum degree of freedom for IN (IN DoF), and the IN
thresholds for the macro and pico users, respectively. Using tools from
stochastic geometry, we first obtain a tractable expression of the coverage
(equivalently outage) probability. Then, we characterize the asymptotic
behavior of the outage probability in the high reliability regime. The
asymptotic results show that the maximum IN DoF can affect the order gain of
the asymptotic outage probability, while the IN thresholds only affect the
coefficient of the asymptotic outage probability. Moreover, we show that the IN
scheme can linearly improve the outage performance, and characterize the
optimal maximum IN DoF which minimizes the asymptotic outage probability.

constant and a perfect fluid by analyzing the existence and stability of the
Einstein static (ES) solutions. We find that there is no stable ES solution for
a spatially flat or open universe. However, for a spatially closed universe,
the stable ES solution does exist, and in the same existence parameter regions,
there also exists an unstable one. With the slow decrease of the equation of
state $w$ of the perfect fluid, the stable and unstable critical points move
close gradually and coincide once $w$ reaches a critical value, so that the
stable critical point becomes an unstable one. As a result, if $w$ approaches a
constant at $t\rightarrow -\infty$, the universe can stay at the stable ES
state past eternally, and furthermore it can naturally exit from this state and
evolve into an inflationary era if $w$ decreases slowly as time goes forward.
Therefore, the emergent scenario that avoids the big bang singularity can be
successfully implemented in the EC theory of gravity.

a coupled system of the barotropic and the first baroclinic modes of the
velocity and the typical midtropospheric temperature. The system considered in

temperature equation. We establish here the global well-posedness of strong
solutions to this model. In proving the global existence of strong solutions,
to overcome the difficulty caused by the absence of the diffusivity in the
temperature equation, we introduce a new velocity $w$ (called the pseudo
baroclinic velocity), which has more regularities than the original baroclinic
mode of the velocity. An auxiliary function $\phi$, which looks like the
effective viscous flux for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, is also
introduced to obtain the $L^\infty$ bound of the temperature. Regarding the
uniqueness, we use the idea of performing suitable energy estimates at level
one order lower than the natural basic energy estimates for the system.

cluster of organisms can regulate the proportion of individuals that perform
various roles or modes as if each individual knows a whole situation without a
leader. A specific ratio exists in various species at multiple levels from the
process of cell differentiation in multicellular organisms to the situation of
social dilemma in a group of human beings. This study found a common basis of
regulating a collective behavior which is realized by a series of local
contacts between individuals. The most essential behavior of individuals in
this theory is to change its internal mode through sharing information in
contact with others. Our numerical simulations with cellular automata model
realize to regulate the ratio of population of individuals who has either two
kinds of modes. From the theoretical analysis and numerical calculations, we
found that asymmetric properties in local contacts, are essential for adaptive
regulation in response to the global information such a group size and whole
density. Furthermore, a discrete system is crucial in no-leader groups to
realize the flexible regulation, and the critical condition which eliminates
overlap with one another (excluded volume effect) also affects the resulting
proportion in high density. The foremost advantage of this strategy is that no
global information is required for each individual, and only a couple of mode
switching can achieve the whole proportion regulation. The simple mechanism say
that proportion regulation in well-organized groups in nature can be realized
through and limited to local contacts, and has a potential to solve various
phenomena that microscopic individuals behaviors connect to macroscopic orderly
behaviors.

provide a detailed mathematical treatment of the effect of temporal noise
correlations on the outcomes of RB protocols. We provide a fully analytic
framework capturing the accumulation of error in RB expressed in terms of a

consistent with existing experimental data -- highlighting potential
finite-sampling pitfalls and the divergence of the mean RB outcome from
worst-case errors in the presence of noise correlations. We use the

Consider a cluster-based network, where multiple sensors scattering across
several clusters will first send their noisy observations to their respective
cluster-heads (CH), who will then forward the data to one common fusion center
(FC). The cluster-heads and the fusion center collectively form a coherent-sum

Our goal is to jointly design the linear transceivers at the CHs and the FC to
maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the recovered signal. We develop
three iterative block coordinated ascent (BCA) algorithms: 2-block BCA based on
semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and rank reduction via randomization or solving
linear equations, 2-block BCA based on iterative second-order cone programming
(SOCP), and multi-block BCA that lends itself to efficient closed-form
solutions in specific but important scenarios. We show that all of these
methods optimize SNR very well but each has different efficiency
characteristics that are tailored for different network setups. Convergence
analysis is carried out and extensive numerical results are presented to
confirm our findings.

remnants (SNRs) inside our Galaxy. These remnants, which also possess bright
non-thermal radio shells, are often found to be interacting directly with
surrounding gas clouds. We explore the non-thermal emission mechanism at these
dynamically evolved SNRs by constructing a hydrodynamical model. Two scenarios
of particle acceleration, either a re-acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays
(CRs) or an efficient nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (NLDSA) of
particles injected from downstream, are considered. Using parameters inferred
from observations, our models are contrasted with the observed spectra of SNR
W44. For the re-acceleration case, we predict a significant enhancement of
radio and GeV emission as the SNR undergoes a transition into the radiative
phase. If sufficiently strong magnetic turbulence is present in the molecular
cloud, the re-acceleration scenario can explain the observed broadband spectral
properties. The NLDSA scenario also succeeds in explaining the $\gamma$-ray
spectrum but fails to reproduce the radio spectral index. Efficient NLDSA also
results in a significant post-shock non-thermal pressure that limits the
compression during cooling and prevents the formation of a prominent dense
shell. Some other interesting differences between the two models in
hydrodynamical behavior and resulting spectral features are illustrated.

arrangement H. This leads to a general theory, incorporating known special
cases with degree 3 braid relations, in which we show that higher degree
relations can occur even for two smooth rational curves meeting at a point.
This theory yields an action of the fundamental group of the complexified
complement of H on the derived category of X, for any such 3-fold that admits
individually floppable curves. We also construct such an action in the more
general case where individual curves may flop analytically, but not
algebraically, and furthermore we lift the action to a form of affine pure
braid group under the additional assumption that X is Q-factorial.
  Along the way, we produce two new types of derived autoequivalences. One uses
commutative deformations of the scheme-theoretic fibre of a flopping
contraction, and the other uses noncommutative deformations of the fibre with
reduced scheme structure, generalising constructions of Toda and the authors
which considered only the case when the flopping locus is irreducible. For type
A flops of irreducible curves, we show that the two autoequivalences are

an unknown distribution over a discrete support, output an approximation of the
distribution that is as accurate as possible in $\ell_1$ distance (i.e. total
variation or statistical distance). Perhaps surprisingly, it is often possible
to ""de-noise"" the empirical distribution of the samples to return an
approximation of the true distribution that is significantly more accurate than
the empirical distribution, without relying on any prior assumptions on the
distribution. We present an instance optimal learning algorithm which optimally
performs this de-noising for every distribution for which such a de-noising is
possible. More formally, given $n$ independent draws from a distribution $p$,
our algorithm returns a labelled vector whose expected distance from $p$ is
equal to the minimum possible expected error that could be obtained by any
algorithm that knows the true unlabeled vector of probabilities of distribution
$p$ and simply needs to assign labels, up to an additive subconstant term that
is independent of $p$ and goes to zero as $n$ gets large. One conceptual
implication of this result is that for large samples, Bayesian assumptions on
the ""shape"" or bounds on the tail probabilities of a distribution over discrete
support are not helpful for the task of learning the distribution.
  As a consequence of our techniques, we also show that given a set of $n$
samples from an arbitrary distribution, one can accurately estimate the
expected number of distinct elements that will be observed in a sample of any
size up to $n \log n$. This sort of extrapolation is practically relevant,
particularly to domains such as genomics where it is important to understand
how much more might be discovered given larger sample sizes, and we are
optimistic that our approach is practically viable.

(NLMS) algorithm between fast convergence rate and low steady-state
misalignment, this paper proposes a variable step size (VSS) NLMS algorithm by
devising a new strategy to update the step size. In this strategy, the input
signal power and the cross-correlation between the input signal and the error
signal are used to estimate the true tracking error power, reducing the effect
of the system noise on the algorithm performance. Moreover, the steady-state
performances of the algorithm are provided for Gaussian white input signal and
are verified by simulations. Finally, simulation results in the context of the
system identification and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) have demonstrated
that the proposed algorithm has lower steady-state misalignment than other VSS

to designing efficient risk communication methods, eliciting risk awareness,
and avoiding unnecessary anxiety among the public. However, public responses to
hazardous events such as climate change, contagious outbreaks, and terrorist
threats are complex and difficult-to-anticipate phenomena. Although many
psychological factors influencing risk perception have been identified in the
past, it remains unclear how perceptions of risk change when propagated from
one person to another and what impact the repeated social transmission of
perceived risk has at the population scale. Here, we study the social dynamics
of risk perception by analyzing how messages detailing the benefits and harms
of a controversial antibacterial agent undergo change when passed from one
person to the next in 10-subject experimental diffusion chains. Our analyses
show that when messages are propagated through the diffusion chains, they tend
to become shorter, gradually inaccurate, and increasingly dissimilar between
chains. In contrast, the perception of risk is propagated with higher fidelity
due to participants manipulating messages to fit their preconceptions, thereby
influencing the judgments of subsequent participants. Computer simulations
implementing this simple influence mechanism show that small judgment biases
tend to become more extreme, even when the injected message contradicts
preconceived risk judgments. Our results provide quantitative insights into the
social amplification of risk perception, and can help policy makers better
anticipate and manage the public response to emerging threats.

phase as best seen in soft X-ray emissions. A recent discovery based on the EUV
Variability Experiment (EVE) observations onboard the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) reveals that some flares exhibit a second large peak
separated from the first main phase peak by tens of minutes to hours, which is
coined as the flare's EUV late phase. In this paper, we address the origin of
the EUV late phase by analyzing in detail two late phase flares, an M2.9 flare
on 2010 October 16 and an M1.4 flare on 2011 February 18, using multi-passband
imaging observations from the Atmospheric Imaing Assembly (AIA) onboard SDO. We
find that: (1) the late phase emission originates from a different magnetic
loop system, which is much larger and higher than the main phase loop system.
(2) The two loop systems have different thermal evolution. While the late phase
loop arcade reaches its peak brightness progressively at a later time spanning
for more than one hour from high to low temperatures, the main phase loop
arcade reaches its peak brightness at almost the same time (within several
minutes) in all temperatures. (3) Nevertheless, the two loop systems seem to be
connected magnetically, forming an asymmetric magnetic quadruple configuration.
(4) Further, the footpoint brightenings in UV wavelengths show a systematic
delay of about one minute from the main flare region to the remote footpoint of
the late phase arcade system. We argue that the EUV late phase is the result of
a long-lasting cooling process in the larger magnetic arcade system.

the main emissions in the late phase are originated from large-scale loop
arcades that are closely connected to but different from the post flare loops
(PFLs), and we also proposed that a long cooling process without additional
heating could explain the late phase. In this paper, we define the extremely
large late phase because it not only has a bigger peak in the warm 33.5
irradiance profile, but also releases more EUV radiative energy than the main
phase. Through detailedly inspecting the EUV images from three point-of-view,
it is found that, besides the later phase loop arcades, the more contribution
of the extremely large late phase is from a hot structure that fails to erupt.
This hot structure is identified as a flux rope, which is quickly energized by
the flare reconnection and later on continuously produces the thermal energy
during the gradual phase. Together with the late-phase loop arcades, the fail
to erupt flux rope with the additional heating create the extremely large EUV
late phase.

proposed to describe the quantized thermal Hall effect. One of these, known as
the gravitational Chern-Simons action, is a kind of topological field theory,
and the other is a phenomenological theory relevant to the St\v{r}eda formula.
In order to solve this problem, we derive microscopically an effective theory
that accounts for the quantized thermal Hall effect. In this paper, the
two-dimensional Dirac fermion under a static background gravitational field is
considered in equilibrium at a finite temperature, from which an effective
boundary free energy functional of the gravitational field is derived. This
boundary theory is shown to explain the quantized thermal Hall conductivity and
thermal Hall current in the bulk by assuming the Lorentz symmetry. The bulk
effective theory is consistently determined via the boundary effective theory

the fields of statistical disclosure control (SDC) and privacy preserving data

fields, k-anonymity has been widely studied as an anonymity notion for mainly
deterministic anonymization algorithms, and some probabilistic relaxations have
been developed. However, they are not sufficient due to their limitations,
i.e., being weaker than the original k-anonymity or requiring strong parametric
assumptions. First we propose Pk-anonymity, a new probabilistic k-anonymity,
and prove that Pk-anonymity is a mathematical extension of k-anonymity rather
than a relaxation. Furthermore, Pk-anonymity requires no parametric
assumptions. This property has a significant meaning in the viewpoint that it
enables us to compare privacy levels of probabilistic microdata release
algorithms with deterministic ones. Second, we apply Pk-anonymity to the post
randomization method (PRAM), which is an SDC algorithm based on randomization.
PRAM is proven to satisfy Pk-anonymity in a controlled way, i.e, one can
control PRAM's parameter so that Pk-anonymity is satisfied. On the other hand,
PRAM is also known to satisfy ${\varepsilon}$-differential privacy, a recent
popular and strong privacy notion. This fact means that our results
significantly enhance PRAM since it implies the satisfaction of both important
notions: k-anonymity and ${\varepsilon}$-differential privacy.

continuous spectrum (to accommodate for the Hawking radiation with energy
$\omega>m$). Each constituent is in a superposition of the ground state and a
Planckian distribution at the expected Hawking temperature in the continuum. We
first find that, assuming the Hawking radiation is the leading effect of the

Interval limits are given by temporal occurrences of key-poses, i.e.
distinctive postures of the body. A key-pose is defined by means of only one or
two specific features of the complete posture. It is often difficult to detect
such subtle features directly. We therefore propose the following method: Given
that we observe the swimmer from the side, we build a pictorial structure of
poselets to robustly identify random support poses within the regular motion of
a swimmer. We formulate a maximum likelihood model which predicts a key-pose
given the occurrences of multiple support poses within one stroke. The maximum
likelihood can be extended with prior knowledge about the temporal location of
a key-pose in order to improve the prediction recall. We experimentally show
that our models reliably and robustly detect key-poses with a high precision

presence of both dispersive and non-dispersive effects which are associated

that, at low wave numbers, the least stable eigenmodes in the left branch of

The bound is similar in spirit to the converse by Polyanskiy, Poor, and Verdu
[IEEE Trans. Info. Theory 56, 2307-2359 (2010)] for classical channel coding,
and also enjoys the saddle point property enabling the order of optimizations
to be interchanged. Equivalently, the bound can be formulated as a semidefinite
program satisfying strong duality. The convex nature of the bound implies
channel symmetries can substantially simplify the optimization, enabling us to
explicitly compute the finite blocklength behavior for several simple qubit
channels. In particular, we find that finite blocklength converse statements
for the classical erasure channel apply to the assisted quantum erasure
channel, while bounds for the classical binary symmetric channel apply to both
the assisted dephasing and depolarizing channels. This implies that these qubit
channels inherit statements regarding the asymptotic limit of large
blocklength, such as the strong converse or second-order converse rates, from
their classical counterparts. Moreover, for the dephasing channel, the finite
blocklength bounds are as tight as those for the classical binary symmetric
channel, since coding for classical phase errors yields equivalently-performing
unassisted quantum codes.

The abundances of the three main isotopes of oxygen are altered in
the course of the CNO-cycle. When the first dredge-up mixes the burning
products to the surface, the nucleosynthesis processes can be probed by
measuring oxygen isotopic ratios. Aims. By measuring 16O/17O and 16O/18O in red
giants of known mass we compare the isotope ratios with predictions from
stellar and galactic evolution modelling. Methods. Oxygen isotopic ratios were
derived from the K-band spectra of six red giants. The sample red giants are
open cluster members with known masses of between 1.8 and 4.5 Msun . The
abundance determination employs synthetic spectra calculated with the COMARCS
code. The effect of uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates, the mixing
length, and of a change in the initial abundance of the oxygen isotopes was
determined by a set of nucleosynthesis and mixing models using the FUNS code.
Results. The observed 16O/17O ratios are in good agreement with the model
results, even if the measured values do not present clear evidence of a
variation with the stellar mass. The observed 16O/18O ratios are clearly lower
than the predictions from our reference model. Variations in nuclear reaction
rates and mixing length parameter both have only a very weak effect on the
predicted values. The 12C/13C ratios of the K giants studied implies the
absence of extra-mixing in these objects. Conclusions. A comparison with
galactic chemical evolution models indicates that the 16O/18O abundance ratio
underwent a faster decrease than predicted. To explain the observed ratios, the
most likely scenario is a higher initial 18O abundance combined with a lower
initial 16 O abundance. Comparing the measured 18 O/17 O ratio with the
corresponding value for the ISM points towards an initial enhancement of 17O as
well. Limitations imposed by the observations prevent this from being a
conclusive result.

However, the observed flow velocities are below the classical threshold for the
onset of KHI in fully ionized plasmas.
  Aims. We investigate the effect of partial ionization on the onset of KHI in
dense and cool cylindrical magnetic flux tubes surrounded by a hotter and
lighter environment.
  Methods. The linearized governing equations of a partially ionized two-fluid
plasma are used to describe the behavior of small-amplitude perturbations
superimposed on a magnetic tube with longitudinal mass flow. A normal mode
analysis is performed to obtain the dispersion relation for linear
incompressible waves. We focus on the appearance of unstable solutions and
study the dependence of their growth rates on various physical parameters. An
analytical approximation of the KHI linear growth rate for slow flows and
strong ion-neutral coupling is obtained. An application to solar prominence
threads is given.
  Results. The presence of a neutral component in a plasma may contribute to
the onset of the KHI even for sub-Alfv\'enic longitudinal shear flows.
Collisions between ions and neutrals reduce the growth rates of the unstable
perturbations but cannot completely suppress the instability.
  Conclusions. Turbulent flows in solar prominences with sub-Alfv\'enic flow
velocities may be interpreted as consequences of KHI in partially ionized
plasmas.

These shift the Higgs boson mass up by typically 5 GeV or more. The dominant

increase with large Dirac gluino mass. The two-loop contributions governed
purely by Yukawa couplings and the MRSSM $\lambda,\Lambda$ parameters are

that the MRSSM can accommodate the measured Higgs and W boson masses. Including

theories associated with supersymmetric $AdS_5\times X$ compactifications,
where $X$ is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold with additional $U(1)$ symmetries.
Under appropriate circumstances, it is found that elements of the chiral ring
that maximize the additional $U(1)$ charge at fixed R-charge are in one to one
correspondence with multitraces of a single composite field. This is also
equivalent to Schur functions of the composite field. It is argued that in the
formal zero coupling limit that these dual field theories have, the different
Schur functions are orthogonal. Together with large $N$ counting arguments, one
predicts that various extremal three point functions are identical to those of
${\cal N}=4 $ SYM, except for a single normalization factor, which can be
argued to be related to the R-charge of the composite word. The leading and
subleading terms in $1/N$ are consistent with a system of free fermions for a
generalized oscillator algebra. One can further test this conjecture by
constructing coherent states for the generalized oscillator algebra that can be
interpreted as branes exploring a subset of the moduli space of the field
theory and use these to compute the effective K\""ahler potential on this subset

and their morphological correspondence with the infrared dust emission. The
total mass of the clouds and the cluster is too small to gravitationally bind
the velocity difference. We frame a hypothesis that the two clouds are
colliding with each other by chance to trigger formation of the $\sim$20

continuing toward part of the 2 km s$^{-1}$ cloud where the bridging feature is
localized. This is the third super star cluster alongside of Westerlund2 and
NGC3603 where cloud-cloud collision triggered the cluster formation. RCW38 is

  with a Mexican-hat potential",,,,,"nlin.CD hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In field theory, particles are waves or excitations that propagate on the
fundamental state. In experiments or cosmological models one typically wants to
compute the out-of-equilibrium evolution of a given initial distribution of
such waves. Wave Turbulence deals with out-of-equilibrium ensembles of weakly
nonlinear waves, and is therefore well-suited to address this problem. As an
example, we consider the complex Klein-Gordon equation with a Mexican-hat
potential. This simple equation displays two kinds of excitations around the
fundamental state: massive particles and massless Goldstone bosons. The former
are waves with a nonzero frequency for vanishing wavenumber, whereas the latter
obey an acoustic dispersion relation. Using wave turbulence theory, we derive
wave kinetic equations that govern the coupled evolution of the spectra of
massive and massless waves. We first consider the thermodynamic solutions to
these equations and study the wave condensation transition, which is the
classical equivalent of Bose-Einstein condensation. We then focus on nonlocal
interactions in wavenumber space: we study the decay of an ensemble massive
particles into massless ones. Under rather general conditions, these massless
particles accumulate at low wavenumber. We study the dynamics of waves
coexisting with such a strong condensate, and we compute rigorously a nonlocal
Kolmogorov-Zakharov solution, where particles are transferred non-locally to
the condensate, while energy cascades towards large wave numbers through local
interactions. This nonlocal cascading state constitute the intermediate
asymptotics between the initial distribution of waves and the thermodynamic
state reached in the long-time limit.

heavy quark and an antiquark pair, which is moving perpendicular to the
direction of orientation, in a strongly-coupled supersymmetric hot plasma. For
the purpose we work on a metric in the gravity side, {\em viz.} OKS-BH
geometry, whose dual in the gauge theory side runs with the energy and hence
proves to be a better background for thermal QCD. The potential obtained has
confining term both in vacuum and in medium, in addition to the Coulomb term
alone, usually reported in the literature. As the velocity of the pair is
increased the screening of the potential gets weakened, which may be understood
by the decrease of effective temperature with the increase of velocity. The
crucial observation of our work is that beyond a critical separation of the
heavy quark pair, the potential develops an imaginary part which is nowadays
understood to be the main source of dissociation. The imaginary part is found
to vanish at small $r$, thus agrees with the perturbative result. Finally we
have estimated the thermal width for the ground and first excited states and
found that non-zero rapidities lead to an increase of thermal width. This
implies that the moving quarkonia dissociate easier than the static ones, which
agrees with other calculations. However, the width in our case is larger than
other calculations due to the presence of confining terms.

Gudder, we study a quantum
generalization of Markov chains and discuss the relation between these maps and
open quantum random walks, a class of quantum channels described by S. Attal et
al. We consider processes which are nonhomogeneous in time, i.e., at each time
step, a possibly distinct evolution kernel. Inspired by a spectral technique
described by L. Saloff-Coste and J. Z\'u\~niga, we define a notion of
ergodicity for nonhomogeneous quantum Markov chains and describe a criterion
for ergodicity of such objects in terms of singular values. As a consequence we
obtain a quantum version of the classical probability result concerning the
behavior of the columns (or rows) of the iterates of a stochastic matrix
induced by a finite, irreducible, aperiodic Markov chain. We are also able to

lapse image data sets of cells are an indispensable tool in the modelling and
understanding of cellular phenomena. In this study we present a theoretical
framework and an algorithm for whole cell tracking. Within this work we
consider that ""tracking"" is equivalent to a dynamic reconstruction of the whole
cell data (morphologies) from static image datasets. The novelty of our work is
that the tracking algorithm is driven by a model for the motion of the cell.
This model may be regarded as a simplification of a recently developed
physically meaningful model for cell motility. The resulting problem is the
optimal control of a geometric evolution law and we discuss the formulation and
numerical approximation of the optimal control problem. The overall goal of
this work is to design a framework for cell tracking within which the recovered
data reflects the physics of the forward model. A number of numerical
simulations are presented that illustrate the applicability of our approach.

renormalization of the Higgs boson mass induced by the introduction of heavier
states. In this respect, naturalness is still a powerful heuristic principle in
model building beyond the standard model whenever new massive states are
coupled to the Higgs field. The most compelling case is provided by the
generation of neutrino masses. In this paper we confront this problem from a
new perspective. The right-handed sector responsible for the seesaw
mechanism---which introduces a large energy threshold above the electroweak
scale---is made supersymmetric to comply with naturalness while the standard
model is left unchanged and non-supersymmetric. Cancellations necessary to the
naturalness requirement break down only at two loops, thus offering the
possibility to increase the right-handed neutrino mass scale up to one order of
magnitude above the usual values allowed by naturalness. If also the weak boson
sector of the standard model is made supersymmetric, cancellations break down
at three loops and the scale of new physics can be further raised. In the
type-I seesaw, this implementation provides right-handed neutrino masses that
are natural and at the same time large enough to give rise to baryogenesis (via
leptogenesis). The model contains a dark matter candidate and distinctive new
physics in the leptonic sector.

regularization. We impose row sparsity on the transformation matrix of LDA
through ${\ell}_{2,1}$-norm regularization to achieve feature selection, and
the resultant formulation optimizes for selecting the most discriminative

extended to the ${\ell}_{2,p}$-norm regularized case: which is more likely to
offer better sparsity when $0<p<1$. Thus the formulation is a better
approximation to the feature selection problem. An efficient algorithm is
developed to solve the ${\ell}_{2,p}$-norm based optimization problem and it is
proved that the algorithm converges when $0<p\le 2$. Systematical experiments
are conducted to understand the work of the proposed method. Promising

magma oceans occurs rapidly and efficiently unlike grain scale percolation
according to laboratory experiments and calculations. Geochemical models of the
core formation process as planetary accretion proceeds are becoming
increasingly realistic. Single stage and continuous core formation models have
evolved into multi-stage models that are couple to the output of dynamical
models of the giant impact phase of planet formation. The models that are most
successful in matching the chemical composition of the Earth's mantle, based on
experimentally-derived element partition coefficients, show that the
temperature and pressure of metal-silicate equilibration must increase as a
function of time and mass accreted and so must the oxygen fugacity of the
equilibrating material. The latter can occur if silicon partitions into the
core and through the late delivery of oxidized material. Coupled dynamical
accretion and multi-stage core formation models predict the evolving mantle and
core compositions of all the terrestrial planets simultaneously and also place
strong constraints on the bulk compositions and oxidation states of primitive

coherently enhanced by factors as large as A^2, where A is the number of
constituents in the composite state (there exist models in which DM states of
very large A > 10^8 may be realised). This enhancement, for a given direct
detection event rate, weakens the expected signals at colliders by up to 1/A.
Moreover, the spatially extended nature of the DM states leads to an
additional, characteristic, form factor modifying the momentum dependence of
scattering processes, altering the recoil energy spectra in direct detection
experiments. In particular, energy recoil spectra with peaks and troughs are
possible, and such features could be confirmed with only O(50) events,
independently of the assumed halo velocity distribution. Large composite states
also generically give rise to low-energy collective excitations potentially
relevant to direct detection and indirect detection phenomenology. We compute
the form factor for a generic class of such excitations - quantised surface
modes - finding that they can lead to coherently-enhanced, but generally
sub-dominant, inelastic scattering in direct detection experiments. Finally, we
study the modifications to capture rates in astrophysical objects that follow
from the elastic form factor, as well as the effects of inelastic interactions

stemming from the curvature elasticity of the membrane. In addition, the

turns out, that even in the case of no viscosity contrast between the bulk

the membrane viscosity. Besides the classical tank treading and tumbling
motions, another mode (called the transition mode in this paper, but originally

parameter for high-dimensional discrete graphical models: the existence of the

  When the data is sparse, there are many zeros in the contingency table and
the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter may not exist. Fienberg and
Rinaldo (2012) have shown that the mle does not exists iff the data vector
belongs to a face of the so-called marginal cone spanned by the rows of the
design matrix of the model. Identifying these faces in high-dimension is
challenging. In this paper, we take a local approach : we show that one such
face, albeit possibly not the smallest one, can be identified by looking at a
collection of marginal graphical models generated by induced subgraphs
$G_i,i=1,\ldots,k$ of $G$. This is our first contribution.
  Our second contribution concerns the composite maximum likelihood estimate.
When the dimension of the problem is large, estimating the parameters of a
given graphical model through maximum likelihood is challenging, if not
impossible. The traditional approach to this problem has been local with the
use of composite likelihood based on local conditional likelihoods.
  A more recent development is to have the components of the composite
likelihood be marginal likelihoods centred around each $v$. We first show that
the estimates obtained by consensus through local conditional and marginal
likelihoods are identical. We then study the asymptotic properties of the
composite maximum likelihood estimate when both the dimension of the model and
the sample size $N$ go to infinity.

decision-theoretic measure of the ""cost"" of parametric uncertainty in decision
making used principally in health economic decision making. Despite this
decision-theoretic grounding, the uptake of EVPPI calculations in practice has
been slow. This is in part due to the prohibitive computational time required
to estimate the EVPPI via Monte Carlo simulations. However, recent developments
have demonstrated that the EVPPI can be estimated by non-parametric regression
methods, which have significantly decreased the computation time required to
approximate the EVPPI. Under certain circumstances, high-dimensional Gaussian
Process regression is suggested, but this can still be prohibitively expensive.
Applying fast computation methods developed in spatial statistics using
Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) and projecting from a
high-dimensional into a low-dimensional input space allows us to decrease the
computation time for fitting these high-dimensional Gaussian Processes, often
substantially. We demonstrate that the EVPPI calculated using our method for
Gaussian Process regression is in line with the standard Gaussian Process
regression method and that despite the apparent methodological complexity of
this new method, R functions are available in the package BCEA to implement it

the effect of assortativity on network synchronization can be compensated by
adjusting the phase damping. Our results show that it is possible to control
collective behavior of damped Kuramoto oscillators by tuning the network

ejecta of compact binary mergers (CBMs) and their relic black-hole (BH)-torus
systems. The evolution of the BH-accretion tori is simulated for seconds with a
Newtonian hydrodynamics code including viscosity effects, pseudo-Newtonian
gravity for rotating BHs, and an energy-dependent two-moment closure scheme for
the transport of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos. The investigated cases
are guided by relativistic double neutron star (NS-NS) and NS-BH merger models,
producing ~3-6 Msun BHs with rotation parameters of A~0.8 and tori of 0.03-0.3
Msun. Our nucleosynthesis analysis includes the dynamical (prompt) ejecta
expelled during the CBM phase and the neutrino and viscously driven outflows of
the relic BH-torus systems. While typically ~20-25% of the initial
accretion-torus mass are lost by viscously driven outflows, neutrino-powered
winds contribute at most another ~1%, but neutrino heating enhances the viscous
ejecta significantly. Since BH-torus ejecta possess a wide distribution of
electron fractions (0.1-0.6) and entropies, they produce heavy elements from
A~80 up to the actinides, with relative contributions of A>130 nuclei being
subdominant and sensitively dependent on BH and torus masses and the exact
treatment of shear viscosity. The combined ejecta of CBM and BH-torus phases
can reproduce the solar abundances amazingly well for A>90. Varying
contributions of the torus ejecta might account for observed variations of
lighter elements with 40<Z<56 relative to heavier ones, and a considerable
reduction of the prompt ejecta compared to the torus ejecta, e.g. in highly
asymmetric NS-BH mergers, might explain the composition of heavy-element
deficient stars.

correlated double-electron emission from a general electronic system. Using
Feshbach projection method, the states of interest are selected by the
projection operator; the Feshbach-Schur map determines the effective
Hamiltonian and the optical potential for the emitted electrons. On the other
hand, the nonequilibrium Green's functions method is demonstrated to be a
complementary approach and an explicit correspondence between both methods is
established. For a self-contained exposition some results on single electron
emission are re-derived using both formalisms. New insights and results are
obtained for the correlated electron-pair emission: This includes the effective
two-electron Hamiltonian, the explicit form of the Feshbach self-energy in
terms of the many-body self-energies, and the diagrammatic expansion of the
two-particle current. As an illustration of the diagrammatic technique the
process of the two-particle emission assisted by the excitation of plasmons is

due to its high efficiency, but it cannot well deal with the large scale target
appearance variations due to its data-independent random projection matrix that
results in less discriminative features. To address this issue, in this paper
we propose an adaptive CT approach, which selects the most discriminative
features to design an effective appearance model. Our method significantly
improves CT in three aspects: Firstly, the most discriminative features are
selected via an online vector boosting method. Secondly, the object
representation is updated in an effective online manner, which preserves the
stable features while filtering out the noisy ones. Finally, a simple and
effective trajectory rectification approach is adopted that can make the
estimated location more accurate. Extensive experiments on the CVPR2013
tracking benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm
compared over state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.

extrapolation, at the cost of increased statistical errors. Typically, one
should use low order for signals based on a small number of iterations while
higher order is efficacious for signals based on large number of iterations. We
provide a heuristic algorithm for determining the order to be used and show its

published before, but the analysis has been improved which is described here at
length, together with details on the experimental setup. Furthermore,
additional data have been analyzed resulting in photon electroproduction cross
sections at new kinematic settings, for a total of 588 experimental bins.
Results of the $Q^2$- and $x_B$-dependences of both the helicity-dependent and
helicity-independent cross sections are discussed. The $Q^2$-dependence
illustrates the dominance of the twist-2 handbag amplitude in the kinematics of
the experiment, as previously noted. Thanks to the excellent accuracy of this
high luminosity experiment, it becomes clear that the unpolarized cross section
shows a significant deviation from the Bethe-Heitler process in our kinematics,
compatible with a large contribution from the leading twist-2 DVCS$^2$ term to
the photon electroproduction cross section. The necessity to include
higher-twist corrections in order to fully reproduce the shape of the data is
also discussed. The DVCS cross sections in this paper represent the final set
of experimental results from E00-110, superseding the previous publication.

the mutual information (MI) of two-dimensional (2D) multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. More recently, the trend is to enhance the
system performance by exploiting the channel's degrees of freedom in the
elevation, which necessitates the derivation and characterization of
three-dimensional (3D) channels in the presence of spatial correlation. In this
paper, an exact closed-form expression for the Spatial Correlation Function
(SCF) is derived for 3D MIMO channels. This novel SCF is developed for a
uniform linear array of antennas with nonisotropic antenna patterns. The
proposed method resorts to the spherical harmonic expansion (SHE) of plane
waves and the trigonometric expansion of Legendre and associated Legendre
polynomials. The resulting expression depends on the underlying arbitrary
angular distributions and antenna patterns through the Fourier Series (FS)
coefficients of power azimuth and elevation spectrums. The novelty of the
proposed method lies in the SCF being valid for any 3D propagation environment.
The developed SCF determines the covariance matrices at the transmitter and the
receiver that form the Kronecker channel model. In order to quantify the
effects of correlation on the system performance, the information-theoretic
deterministic equivalents of the MI for the Kronecker model are utilized in
both mono-user and multi-user cases. Numerical results validate the proposed
analytical expressions and elucidate the dependence of the system performance
on azimuth and elevation angular spreads and antenna patterns. Some useful
insights into the behaviour of MI as a function of downtilt angles are
provided. The derived model will help evaluate the performance of correlated 3D
MIMO channels in the future.

coordinates of a structure and drug discovery. Single-domain protein side-chain
packing has been thoroughly studied. A major challenge in generalizing these
methods to protein complexes is that they, unlike monomers, often have very
large treewidth, and thus algorithms such as TreePack cannot be directly
applied. To address this issue, SCWRL4 treats the complex effectively as a
monomer, heuristically excluding weak interactions to decrease treewidth; as a
result, SCWRL4 generates poor packings on protein interfaces. To date, few
side-chain packing methods exist that are specifically designed for protein
complexes. In this paper, we introduce a method, iTreePack, which solves the
side-chain packing problem for complexes by using a novel combination of dual
decomposition and tree decomposition. In particular, iTreePack overcomes the
problem of large treewidth by decomposing a protein complex into smaller
subgraphs and novelly reformulating the complex side-chain packing problem as a
dual relaxation problem; this allows us to solve the side-chain packing of each
small subgraph separately using tree-decomposition. A projected subgradient
algorithm is applied to enforcing the consistency among the side-chain packings
of all the small subgraphs. Computational results demonstrate that our
iTreePack program outperforms SCWRL4 on protein complexes. In particular,
iTreePack places side-chain atoms much more accurately on very large complexes,
which constitute a significant portion of protein-protein interactions.
Moreover, the advantage of iTreePack over SCWRL4 increases with respect to the
treewidth of a complex. Even for monomeric proteins, iTreePack is much more
efficient than SCWRL and slightly more accurate.

that was introduced recently in the design of geometric QPTASs, but was not yet
used for exact algorithms and for planar graphs. We focus on the Voronoi
diagram of a hypothetical solution of $k$ objects, guess a balanced separator
cycle of this Voronoi diagram to obtain a set that separates the solution in a
balanced way, and then recurse on the resulting subproblems. We complement our
study by giving evidence that packing problems have $n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ time

  Singular Value Decomposition","Neural Information Processing Systems 2015",,,,"cs.DS cs.LG cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since being analyzed by Rokhlin, Szlam, and Tygert and popularized by Halko,
Martinsson, and Tropp, randomized Simultaneous Power Iteration has become the
method of choice for approximate singular value decomposition. It is more
accurate than simpler sketching algorithms, yet still converges quickly for any
matrix, independently of singular value gaps. After $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)$
iterations, it gives a low-rank approximation within $(1+\epsilon)$ of optimal
for spectral norm error.
  We give the first provable runtime improvement on Simultaneous Iteration: a
simple randomized block Krylov method, closely related to the classic Block
Lanczos algorithm, gives the same guarantees in just
$\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ iterations and performs substantially better
experimentally. Despite their long history, our analysis is the first of a
Krylov subspace method that does not depend on singular value gaps, which are
unreliable in practice.
  Furthermore, while it is a simple accuracy benchmark, even $(1+\epsilon)$
error for spectral norm low-rank approximation does not imply that an algorithm
returns high quality principal components, a major issue for data applications.
We address this problem for the first time by showing that both Block Krylov
Iteration and a minor modification of Simultaneous Iteration give nearly
optimal PCA for any matrix. This result further justifies their strength over
non-iterative sketching methods.
  Finally, we give insight beyond the worst case, justifying why both
algorithms can run much faster in practice than predicted. We clarify how
simple techniques can take advantage of common matrix properties to
significantly improve runtime.

It is
pivotal to know when the dynamics underlying a walk lead to quantum advantages
just by examining its statistics. A walk with many indistinguishable particles
and measurements of non-classical multi-particle correlations is likely to
reveal the quantum nature. The number of elements $O(n)$ in a setup realizing
walks grows with their length or spread $n$. We introduce the concept of a
quantum leap, a process which can be achieved with fewer or complementary
resources and which in a single step simulates another long process. The
process and its leap are described by the same Hamiltonian but, the latter
parametrizes the evolution with a tunable parameter of a setup. In the case of
walks, a leap immediately gives a probability distribution which results only
after many steps. This may be appealing for simulation of processes which are
lengthy or require dynamical control. We discuss a leap based on the
multi-particle Hong--Ou--Mandel interference, an inherently quantum phenomenon.
It reproduces a quantum walk enabling perfect state transfer through spin
chains. It requires a beam splitter, two detectors and $n$ particles to mimic a
walk on a chain of size $O(n)$, for time fixed by beam-splitter's reflectivity.
Our results apply to a broad class of systems where the HOM-like effects can be
observed, and may constitute a new approach to simulation of complex
Hamiltonians with passive interferometers.

behaviour in these photometric bands is very different from that observed with
the more conventional broad bands like UBVRI or ugriz, providing unique
information about extent and ionization of the ejecta, the onset of critical
phases like the transition between optically thick and thin conditions, and
re-ionization by the central super-soft X-ray source. The actual transmission
profiles of the y, b, [OIII] and Halpha photometric filters have been
accurately measured at different epochs and different illumination angles, to
evaluate in detail their performance under exact operating conditions. The
extreme smoothness of both the Halpha and [OIII] lightcurves argues for absence
of large and abrupt discontinuities in the ejecta of Nova Del 2013. Should they
exist, glitches in the lightcurves would have appeared when the ionization
and/or recombination fronts overtook them. During the period of recorded very
large variability (up to 100x over a single day) in the super-soft X-ray
emission (from day +69 to +86 past V maximum), no glitch in excess of 1% was
observed in the optical photometry, either in the continuum (Stromgren y) or in
the lines ([OIII] and Halpha filters), or in a combination of the two
(Stromgren b, Johnson B and V). Considering that the recombination time scale
in the ejecta was one week at that time, this excludes global changes of the
white dwarf as the source of the X-ray variability and supports instead clumpy

consider a Hamiltonian function describing the effect of the geopotential and
we use suitable finite expansions of the Hamiltonian for the description of the
different resonances. In particular, we determine the leading terms which
dominate in a specific orbital region, thus limiting our computation to very
few harmonics. Taking advantage from the pendulum-like structure associated to
each term of the expansion, we are able to determine the amplitude of the
islands corresponding to the different harmonics. By means of simple
mathematical formulae, we can predict the occurrence of splitting or
overlapping of the resonant islands for different values of the parameters. We
also find several cases which exhibit a transcritical bifurcation as the
inclination is varied. These results, which are based on a careful mathematical
analysis of the Hamiltonian expansion, are confirmed by a numerical study of
the dynamical behavior obtained by computing the so-called Fast Laypunov

inequality. The proofs in the paper unify and are simpler than those in former
work. Meanwhile, we also find mathematical equivalences among the Bernoulli
inequality, the weighted AM-GM inequality, the H\""{o}lder inequality, the
weighted power mean inequality and the Minkowski inequality. Finally, a series
of the applications are shown in this note.

are employed to illustrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the method.
Obtained results are compared with some early studies.

Pagenumber-$k$ Subgraph Problem asks for a maximum subgraph $G'$ of $G$ such

spine according to the specified total order. We show that this problem is
NP-complete for $k \geq 2$.

Both the enumerative geometrical significance of multispecies weighted Hurwitz
numbers, as weighted enumerations of branched coverings of the Riemann sphere,
and their combinatorial significance in terms of weighted paths in the Cayley
graph of $S_n$ are derived. The particular case of multispecies quantum
weighted Hurwitz numbers is studied in detail.
