demonstrated that when the black hole is near-extremal, that the wave equation
for the massless scalar field simplifies to a Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger type
equation with the well known P$\ddot{o}$shler-Teller potential. We have also
used 6th order WKB approximation to compute quasinormal mode frequencies to
compare with exact values obtained via the P$\ddot{o}$shler-Tell method for
comparison. As an application, we have obtained the area spectrum using
modified Hods approach and show that it is equally spaced.

in the late 1970s in the field of integrable systems. They are subalgebras of
Lie algebras over a ring of rational functions, defined by invariance under the
action of a finite group, the reduction group. Since their introduction in 2005
a classification is pursued. Past work shows remarkable uniformity between the
Lie algebras associated to different reduction groups. That is, many
Automorphic Lie Algebras with nonisomorphic reduction groups are isomorphic. In
this thesis we set out to find the origin of these observations by searching
for properties that are independent of the reduction group, called invariants
of Automorphic Lie Algebras.
  Several invariants are obtained and used to set up a structure theory for
Automorphic Lie Algebras. This naturally leads to a cohomology theory for root
systems. A first exploration of this structure theory narrows down the search
for Automorphic Lie Algebras significantly. Various particular cases are fully
determined by their invariants, including most of the previously studied
Automorphic Lie Algebras, thereby providing an explanation for their
uniformity. In addition, the structure theory advances the classification
project. For example, it clarifies the effect of a change in pole orbit
resulting in various new Cartan-Weyl normal form generators for Automorphic Lie
Algebras. From a more general perspective, the success of the structure theory
and root cohomology in absence of a field promises interesting theoretical
developments for Lie algebras over a graded ring.

we describe how to employ suitable particle actions in the computation of the
scalar contribution to the one-loop gluon effective action. We use the
well-known method of introducing auxiliary variables that create the color
degrees of freedom. In a path integral they implement automatically the path
ordering needed to ensure gauge invariance. It is known that the color degrees
of freedom introduced this way form a reducible representation of the gauge
group. We describe a method of projecting onto the fundamental representation
(or any other chosen irrep, if desired) of the gauge group. Previously, we have
discussed the case of anticommuting auxiliary variables. Choosing them to be in
the fundamental representation allows to obtain, without any extra effort, also
the situation in which the color is given by any antisymmetric tensor product
of the fundamental. Here, we describe the novel case of bosonic auxiliary
variables. They can be used equivalently for creating the color charges in the
fundamental representation. In addition one gets, as a byproduct, the cases
where the particle can have the color sitting in any symmetric tensor product
of the fundamental. This is obtained by tuning to a different value a Chern
Simons coupling, present in the model, which controls how the projection is
achieved.

realizations of the Kitaev model, and their reported magnetic behaviors may be

for dominant bond-directional interactions in antiferromagnetic Na2IrO3 and
show that they lead to strong magnetic frustration. Diffuse magnetic x-ray
scattering reveals broken spin-rotational symmetry even above Neel temperature,
with the three spin components exhibiting nano-scale correlations along

of external electrochemical potentials (voltage) within metallic structures and
their effect on the self consistent partial atomic charges used in reactive

local potential in its vicinity and we use fictitious, but computationally
convenient, dynamics to describe its equilibration within not-simply connected
metallic structures on-the-fly during the molecular dynamics simulation. This
local electrostatic potential is used to dynamically modify the atomic
electronegativities used to compute partial atomic changes via charge
equilibration. Validation tests show that the method provides an accurate
description of the electric fields generated by the applied voltage and the
driving force for electrochemical reactions. We demonstrate EChemDID via
simulations of the operation of electrochemical metallization cells. The
simulations predict the switching of the device between a high-resistance to a
low-resistance state as a conductive metallic bridge is formed and resistive
currents that can be compared with experimental measurements. In addition to
applications in nanoelectronics, EChemDID could be useful to model

and are assumed to form a distributed caching network. Popular data files are
stored in the local cache of SBS, so that users can download the desired files
from one of the SBS in the vicinity subject to availability. The
offloading-loss is captured via a cost function that depends on a random
caching strategy proposed in this paper. The cost function depends on the
popularity profile, which is, in general, unknown. In this work, the popularity
profile is estimated at the BS using the available instantaneous demands from
the users in a time interval $[0,\tau]$. This is then used to find an estimate
of the cost function from which the optimal random caching strategy is devised.
The main results of this work are the following: First it is shown that the
waiting time $\tau$ to achieve an $\epsilon>0$ difference between the achieved
and optimal costs is finite, provided the user density is greater than a
predefined threshold. In this case, $\tau$ is shown to scale as $N^2$, where
$N$ is the support of the popularity profile. Secondly, a transfer
learning-based approach is proposed to obtain an estimate of the popularity
profile used to compute the empirical cost function. A condition is derived
under which the proposed transfer learning-based approach performs better than
the random caching strategy.

studied, showing that other SME coefficients can be moved to nongravitational

boundaries, it is possible to correct its action to get the desired equations
of motion. Moreover, through a reformulation as a Lanczos-type tensor, some
problematic features of the $t$ term, which should arise at the
phenomenological level, are revealed. The most important conclusion of the
paper is that there is no evidence of a fundamental explanation for the $t$

dissipate energy with concomitant entropy production. Additionally, signaling
often takes place in challenging environmental conditions. In a simple model
regulatory circuit given by an input and a delayed output, we explore the
trade-offs between information transmission and the system's energetic
efficiency. We determine the maximally informative network, given a fixed
amount of entropy production and delayed response, exploring both the case with
and without feedback. We find that feedback allows the circuit to overcome
energy constraints and transmit close to the maximum available information even
in the dissipationless limit. Negative feedback loops, characteristic of shock
responses, are optimal at high dissipation. Close to equilibrium positive
feedback loops, known for their stability, become more informative. Asking how
the signaling network should be constructed to best function in the worst

discover that at large dissipation the same universal motif is optimal in all

model with opinion makers. The process models an election with two candidates
but can also describe the frequencies of a biallelic gene in a population or
atoms with two spin orientations in a magnetic material. The system is
represented by a network whose nodes have internal states labeled 0 or 1, and
nodes that are connected can influence each other. The network is perturbed by
a set of external nodes whose states are fixed in 0 or 1 and that can influence
all nodes of the network. The fixed nodes play the role of opinion makers in
the voter model, mutation rates in population genetics or temperature in a
magnetic material. The quantity of interest is the probability $\rho(m,t)$ that
$m$ nodes are in state 1 at time $t$. Here we study this process on star
networks and compare the results with those obtained for networks that are
fully connected. In both cases a transition from disordered to ordered
equilibrium states is observed as the number of external fixed nodes becomes
small, but it differs significantly between the two network topologies. For
fully connected networks the probability distribution becomes uniform at the
critical point, which is independent of the network size. For star networks, on
the other hand, the equilibrium distribution $\rho(m)$ splits in two peaks,
reflecting the two possible states of the central node. We obtain approximate
analytical solutions that hold near the transition and that clarify the role of
the central node in the process. We show that the different character of the
transition also manifest itself in the magnetization of system, obtained in the
limit of large $N$. Finally, extending the analysis to two star networks we

Through extensive experiments on real-world CDR data for a large city in

evaluating the $Z_2$ invariant and Chern number using formulas based on the

to bound excitons is due to graphene's poor screening, illustrating a unique
mechanism in this QD to occupy higher-energy states for long timescales. GQD
edges can be terminated with either armchair or zigzag carbon patterns, and
this edge structure changes excited state lifetimes by orders of magnitude.

cold ring at about half the void's effective radius surrounded by a hot ring
near the void's boundary. The source of the temperature structure is assumed to
be the ISW effect but the exact cause of the ringed structure is not currently
well understood, particularly the outer hot ring. Numerical simulations have
suggested that hot/cold ring structures can be produced by motions associated
with nonlinear growths of cosmic structures whose gravitational potentials
produce the ISW effect. We have recently developed the embedded lens theory and
the Fermat potential formalism which can be used to model the ISW effect caused
by intervening individual lens inhomogeneities evolving arbitrarily. This
theory only requires knowledge of the void's projected mass profile as a
function of the passing CMB photons' impact radius and the rate of change of
that mass distribution at passage. We present two simple embedded void lens
models with evolving mass densities and investigate the ISW effect caused by
these lenses. Both models posses expanding mass shells which produce hot rings
around central cold regions, consistent with the recent observations. By adding
a small over-density at the void's center we can produce the slight positive
temperature excess hinted at in Planck's photometric results. We conclude that
the embedded lens theory and the Fermat potential formalism is well suited for

path, $\lambda_{\rm mfp}$. In the original BDMPSZ formalism, the energy loss of

diagrammatic approach to the anomalous Hall effect is limited to computation of
ladder diagrams. We demonstrate that this approach is insufficient. An
important additional contribution comes from diagrams with a single pair of
intersecting disorder lines. This contribution constitutes an inherent part of
skew scattering on pairs of closely located defects and essentially modifies
previously obtained results for anomalous Hall conductivity. We argue that this
statement is general and applies to all models of anomalous Hall effect. We
illustrate it by an explicit calculation for two-dimensional massive Dirac
fermions with weak disorder. In this case, inclusion of the diagrams with
crossed impurity lines reverses the sign of the skew scattering term and
strongly suppresses the total Hall conductivity at high electron
concentrations.

Many
branches of science and engineering are concerned with the question of which
given resource objects can be converted into which target resource objects. For
example, information theory studies the conversion of a noisy communication
channel instance into an exchange of information. Inspired by work in quantum
information theory, we develop a general mathematical toolbox for this type of
question. The convertibility of resources into other ones and the possibility
of combining resources is accurately captured by the mathematics of ordered
commutative monoids. As an intuitive example, we consider chemistry, where
chemical reaction equations such as \[ \mathrm{2H_2 + O_2} \to \mathrm{2H_2O}
\] are concerned both with a convertibility relation ""$\to$"" and a combination
operation ""$+$"". We study ordered commutative monoids from an algebraic and
functional-analytic perspective and derive a wealth of results which should
have applications to concrete resource theories, such as a formula for rates of
conversion. As a running example showing that ordered commutative monoids are
also of purely mathematical interest, we exemplify our results with the ordered
commutative monoid of graphs.
  While closely related to both Girard's linear logic and to Deutsch's
constructor theory, our framework also produces results very reminiscent of the
utility theorem of von Neumann and Morgenstern in decision theory and of a
theorem of Lieb and Yngvason on thermodynamics.
  Concerning pure algebra, our observation is that some pieces of algebra can
be developed in a context in which equality is not necessarily symmetric, i.e.
in which the equality relation is replaced by an ordering relation. For
example, notions like cancellativity or torsion-freeness are still sensible and
very natural concepts in our ordered setting.

admits a proper vertex coloring with $k$ colors unless the Strong Exponential
Time Hypothesis (SETH) is false. We show here that nevertheless, when
$k>\lfloor \Delta/2 \rfloor + 1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree in the
graph $G$, there is a better algorithm, at least when there are few colorings.
We present a Monte Carlo algorithm that given a graph $G$ along with a path
decomposition of $G$ with pathwidth $\operatorname{pw}(G)$ runs in $(\lfloor
\Delta/2 \rfloor + 1)^{\operatorname{pw}(G)}\operatorname{poly}(n)s$ time, that
distinguishes between $k$-colorable graphs having at most $s$ proper
$k$-colorings and non-$k$-colorable graphs. We also show how to obtain a
$k$-coloring in the same asymptotic running time. Our algorithm avoids
violating SETH for one since high degree vertices still cost too much and the
mentioned hardness construction uses a lot of them.
  We exploit a new variation of the famous Alon--Tarsi theorem that has an
algorithmic advantage over the original form. The original theorem shows a
graph has an orientation with outdegree less than $k$ at every vertex, with a
different number of odd and even Eulerian subgraphs only if the graph is
$k$-colorable, but there is no known way of efficiently finding such an
orientation. Our new form shows that if we instead count another difference of
even and odd subgraphs meeting modular degree constraints at every vertex
picked uniformly at random, we have a fair chance of getting a non-zero value
if the graph has few $k$-colorings. Yet every non-$k$-colorable graph gives a
zero difference, so a random set of constraints stands a good chance of being
useful for separating the two cases.

apparent path of these objects were retrieved from the detectors, i.e. the

rotational periods and amplitudes in the unfiltered Kepler band as follows: for

calculate spot coverage fractions from each map, and as a result we find a
general trend that is interpreted to be an indication of a spot cycle. There is
a minimum during the observing season of March 1999. After this the activity
increases until November 2000, followed by a general decrease in activity
again. We find no evidence for active longitudes persisting over multiple
observing seasons. The spot activity appears to be concentrated to two latitude
regions. The high latitude spots are particularly strong when the spot coverage
is at a maximum. Using the currently accepted rotation period, we find spot
structures to show a trend in the phase-time plot, indicative of a need for a
longer period. We conclude that the long-term activity of LQ~Hya is more

electron-positron pairs from the vacuum. These electrons collapse onto the
nucleus resulting in a net charge $Z_n<Z$ while the positrons are emitted. This
effect is due to the relativistic dispersion law. The same reason leads to the
collapse of electrons to the charged impurity with a large charge number $Z$ in
narrow-band gap semiconductors and Weyl semimetals as well as graphene. In this
paper, a similar effect of electron collapse and charge renormalization is
found for donor clusters in SrTiO$_3$ (STO), but with a very different origin.
At low temperatures, STO has an enormously large dielectric constant. Because
of this, the nonlinear dielectric response becomes dominant when the electric
field is not too small. We show that this leads to the collapse of surrounding
electrons into a charged spherical donor cluster with radius $R$ when its total
charge number $Z$ exceeds a critical value $Z_c\simeq R/a$ where $a$ is the
lattice constant. Using the Thomas-Fermi approach, we find that the net charge
$Z_ne$ grows with $Z$ until $Z$ exceeds another value $Z^*\simeq(R/a)^{9/7}$.
After this point, $Z_n$ remains $\sim Z^*$. We extend our results to the case
of long cylindrical clusters. Our predictions can be tested by creating discs
and stripes of charge on the STO surface.

heterogeneous and statistically dependent sensor observations. Each sensor aims
to maximize its inference performance by forming a coalition with other sensors
and sharing information within the coalition. It is proved that the inference
performance is a nondecreasing function of the coalition size. However, in an
energy constrained network, the energy consumption of inter-sensor
communication also increases with increasing coalition size, which discourages
the formation of the grand coalition (the set of all sensors). In this paper,
the formation of non-overlapping coalitions with statistically dependent
sensors is investigated under a specific communication constraint. We apply a
game theoretical approach to fully explore and utilize the information
contained in the spatial dependence among sensors to maximize individual sensor
performance. Before formulating the distributed inference problem as a
coalition formation game, we first quantify the gain and loss in forming a
coalition by introducing the concepts of diversity gain and redundancy loss for
both estimation and detection problems. These definitions, enabled by the
statistical theory of copulas, allow us to characterize the influence of
statistical dependence among sensor observations on inference performance. An
iterative algorithm based on merge-and-split operations is proposed for the
solution and the stability of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Numerical
results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed game
theoretical approach.

has a median mass of 0.3 $M_\odot$ and is most likely a white dwarf. Fully
recycled MSPs like this one are thought to be old neutron stars spun-up by mass
transfer from a companion star. This process should circularize the orbit, as
is observed for the vast majority of binary MSPs, which predominantly have
orbital eccentricities $e < 0.001$. However, four recently discovered binary
MSPs have orbits with $0.027 < e < 0.44$; PSR J1950+2414 is the fifth such

derivative and inferred surface magnetic field strength are comparable to those
of the general MSP population. The large eccentricities are incompatible with
the predictions of the standard recycling scenario: something unusual happened
during their evolution. Proposed scenarios are a) initial evolution of the
pulsar in a triple system which became dynamically unstable, b) origin in an
exchange encounter in an environment with high stellar density, c) rotationally
delayed accretion-induced collapse of a super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf, and d)
dynamical interaction of the binary with a circumbinary disk. We compare the
properties of all five known eccentric MSPs with the predictions of these
formation channels. Future measurements of the masses and proper motion might
allow us to firmly exclude some of the proposed formation scenarios.

misaligned with the stellar component. These discs feel a torque from the stars
and the angular momentum vectors are expected to align quickly. We present
results on the evolution of a misaligned gas disc in a cosmological simulation
of a massive early-type galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environments
project. This galaxy experiences a merger which, together with a strong
galactic wind, removes most of the original gas disc. The galaxy subsequently
reforms a gas disc through accretion of cold gas, but it is initially 120
degrees misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. This misalignment persists
for about 2 Gyr before the gas-star misalignment angle drops below 20 degrees.
The time it takes for the gaseous and stellar components to align is much
longer than previously thought, because the gas disc is accreting a significant
amount of mass for about 1.5 Gyr after the merger, during which the angular
momentum change induced by accreted gas dominates over that induced by stellar
torques. Once the gas accretion rate has decreased sufficiently, the gas disc
decouples from the surrounding halo gas and realigns with the stellar component
in about 6 dynamical times. During the late evolution of the misaligned gas
disc, the centre aligns faster than the outskirts, resulting in a warped disc.
We discuss the observational consequences of the long survival of our
misaligned gas disc and how our results can be used to calibrate merger rate
estimates from observed gas misalignments.

great challenge to our current understanding of the astrophysics of the halos

required $M\simeq10^{12}$ $M_{\odot}$, exceeding the expected baryonic mass
available, or one must invoke extreme gas clumping factors not present in
high-resolution cosmological simulations. However, observations of Ly-alpha
emission alone cannot distinguish between these two scenarios. We have obtained
the deepest ever spectroscopic integrations in the HeII and CIV lines with the
goal of detecting extended line emission, but detect neither line to a
3$\sigma$ limiting SB $\simeq10^{-18}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$. We construct
models of the expected emission spectrum in the highly probable scenario that
the nebula is powered by photoionization from the central hyper-luminous
quasar. The non-detection of HeII implies that the nebular emission arises from
a mass $M_{\rm c}\lesssim6.4\times10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$ of cool gas on ~200 kpc
scales, distributed in a population of remarkably dense ($n_{\rm H}\gtrsim3$
cm$^{-3}$) and compact ($R\lesssim20$ pc) clouds, which would clearly be
unresolved by current cosmological simulations. Given the large gas motions
suggested by the Ly-alpha line ($v\simeq$ 500 km/s), it is unclear how these
clouds survive without being disrupted by hydrodynamic instabilities. Our study
serves as a benchmark for future deep integrations with current and planned
wide-field IFU such as MUSE, KCWI, and KMOS. Our work suggest that a $\simeq$
10 hr exposure would likely detect ~10 rest-frame UV/optical emission lines,
opening up the possibility of conducting detailed photoionization modeling to
infer the physical state of gas in the CGM.

molecular clouds forms stars, leading to the observed low star formation rate
(SFR). The same holds when averaged over many molecular clouds, such that the
SFR of whole galaxies is again surprisingly low. Indeed, considering the low
temperatures, molecular clouds should be highly gravitationally unstable and
collapse on their global mean freefall timescale. And yet, they are observed to
live about 10-100 times longer, i.e., the SFR per freefall time (SFR_ff) is
only a few percent. Thus, other physical mechanisms must counteract the quick
global collapse. Turbulence, magnetic fields and stellar feedback have been
proposed as regulating agents, but it is still unclear which of these processes
is the most important and what their relative contributions are. Here we run
high-resolution simulations including gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, and
jet/outflow feedback. We confirm that clouds collapse on a mean freefall time,
if only gravity is considered, producing stars at an unrealistic rate. In
contrast, if turbulence, magnetic fields, and feedback are included
step-by-step, the SFR is reduced by a factor of 2-3 with each additional
physical ingredient. When they all act in concert, we find a constant SFR_ff =

2-4 higher than the average. A detailed comparison with other simulations and
with observations leads us to conclude that only models with turbulence

that towards the stellar bulge there are no large scale absorption phenomena

(local) contribution from hot ($\sim1000$ K) dust to the nuclear NIR emission.
The position where this takes place appears to be closer to the offset compact
radio emission from our e-Merlin $6$ cm map, lying offset by $\sim4.25$ pc from
the center of the underlying stellar bulge. The shape of the radio map suggests
the presence of one (or possibly two, forming an X-shape) bipolar structure(s)

gas and the stellar velocity dispersions and the presence of hard X-ray
emission, point towards effects expected by AGN feedback. We also argue that

characteristics. The latter combined with the observed spatial and radio
offsets, the relative redshift between the broad and the narrow

to a background from inspiralling super-massive black hole binaries,
constraining the GW energy density to $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}(f)h^2 <

network for a set of possible scenarios, and for a stochastic relic GWB. For a

$G\mu/c^2<1.3\times10^{-7}$, identical to that set by the {\it Planck}

Lya profile with the main peak redward of the systemic redshift defined by
nebular lines, and five have a weak, secondary peak blueward of the systemic
redshift (blue bump). The average velocity offset of the red main peak (the
blue bump, if any) with respect to the systemic redshift is Delta_v_Lya,r =
174+/- 19 km s-1 (Delta_v_Lya,b = -316+/-45 km s-1), which is smaller than
(comparable to) that of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). The outflow velocities
inferred from metal absorption lines in three individual and one stacked
spectra are comparable to those of LBGs. The expanding shell model constructed
by Verhamme et al. (2006) reproduces not only the Lya profiles but also other
observed quantities including the outflow velocity and the FWHM of nebular
lines for the non-blue bump objects. On the other hand, the model predicts too
high FWHMs of nebular lines for the blue bump objects, although this
discrepancy may disappear if we introduce additional Lya photons produced by
gravitational cooling. We show that the small Delta_v_Lya,r values of our
sample can be explained by low neutral-hydrogen column densities of log(NHI) =
18.9 cm-2 on average. This value is more than one order of magnitude lower than
those of LBGs but is consistent with recent findings that LAEs have high
ionization parameters and low Hi gas masses. This result suggests that low NHI
values, giving reduced numbers of resonant scattering of Lya photons, are the
key to the strong Lya emission of LAEs.

window around 1{\mu}m from only moderate resolution data. The method is
therefore extremely efficient, allowing stars at large distances to be studied,
and so has tremendous potential for extragalactic abundance work. Here, we
present an abundance study of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and

consistent with other studies of young stars in these galaxies, and though our
result for the SMC may appear high it is consistent with recent studies of hot
stars which find 0.5-0.8dex below Solar. Our best-fit temperatures are on the
whole consistent with those from fits to the optical-infrared spectral energy
distributions, which is remarkable considering the narrow spectral range being
studied. Combined with our recent study of RSGs in the Galactic cluster Per

post-infall evolution of the progenitor, which has experienced 3 pericentric
passages and lost more than 2 orders of magnitude in mass. At infall,
$5.4\pm0.6$ Gyr ago, the progenitor was a disky dwarf with mass of
$\log_{10}[m(<3.4\pm1 {\rm kpc})/ M_\odot]=10.35\pm0.25$. We illustrate how the
90$^\circ$ turn in the stream, identifying the `dog leg', is the signature of
the progenitor's prograde rotation. Today, the remnant is a nucleated dwarf,
with a LOS velocity of $v_{\rm p, los}^{\rm obs}=-30\pm 30$ kms$^{-1}$, and a
luminosity of $3.3\times 10^7 L_{V,\odot}$ (Galianni et al. 2010). Our
independent analysis predicts $v_{\rm p, los}=-51^{-17}_{+14}$ kms$^{-1}$, and
measures $\log_{10}(m/ M_\odot)=7.4^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$, so that the compact nucleus
is soon becoming a low-luminosity UCD. We find that NGC 1097 has a mass of
$M_{200}=1.8^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \times 10^{12}\; M_{\odot}$, and its concentration
$c_{200}=6.7^{+2.4}_{-1.3}$ is in agreement with LCDM. The stream is described
almost down to the noise in a spherical host potential, we find this would not
be possible if the halo was substantially triaxial at large radii. Its
morphology shows that the slope of the total density profile bends from an
inner $\gamma(r_{\rm peri})=1.5\pm0.15$. The progenitor's orbit reaches $r_{\rm
apo}=150\pm 15$ kpc, more than a half of the virial radius of the host, so
that, for the first time on an individual extragalactic halo, we measure the
outer density slope, $\gamma(0.6r_{200,c})=3.9\pm0.5$. This demonstrates the
promise of the newborn field of detailed, statistical modelling of
extragalactic tidal streams.

preferentially affects stars at its far side, and because the NSC rotates, this
causes higher extinctions for NSC stars with negative u_l, as well as an
asymmetry in the u_l-histograms. We model these effects using an axisymmetric
dynamical model of the NSC in combination with simple models for the dust
distribution. Comparing the predicted asymmetry to data for ~7100 stars in
several NSC fields, we find that dust associated with the Galactic center
mini-spiral with extinction A_K~=0.15-0.8 mag explains most of the data. The
largest extinction A_K~=0.8 mag is found in the region of the Western arm of
the mini-spiral. Comparing with total A_K determined from stellar colors, we
determine the extinction in front of the NSC. Finally, we estimate that for a

from the SOHO/LASCO/C2 coronagraph. From AIA He II 304 {\AA} movies and

the front of the jet transits the corona below 2.2 RSun at a speed typically
several times the sound speed; (2) each jet displays an exceptionally large
amount of spin as it erupts; (3) in the outer corona, most of the jets display
measureable swaying and bending of a few degrees in amplitude; in three jets
the swaying is discernibly oscillatory with a period of order 1 hour. These

wave that is basically a large-amplitude (i.e., non-linear) torsional Alfven
wave that is put into the reconnected open field in the jet by interchange
reconnection as the jet erupts. From the measured spinning and swaying we
estimate that the magnetic-untwisting wave loses most of its energy in the

theoretical bounds expected for a distribution of energy with ejecta Lorentz
factor. Our measured values of the circumburst density, jet opening angle, and
beaming corrected kinetic energy are consistent with the distribution of these
parameters for long-duration GRBs at both z~1 and z>6, suggesting that the jet
launching mechanism and environment of these events are similar to that of GRBs
that do not have bumps in their light curves. However, events exhibiting
re-brightening episodes have lower radiative efficiencies than average,
suggesting that a majority of the kinetic energy of the outflow is carried by
slow-moving ejecta, which is further supported by steep measured distributions
of the ejecta energy as a function of Lorentz factor. We do not find evidence
for reverse shocks over the energy injection period, implying that the onset of
energy injection is a gentle process. We further show that GRBs exhibiting
simultaneous X-ray and optical re-brightenings are likely the tail of a
distribution of events with varying rates of energy injection, forming the most
extreme events in their class. Future X-ray observations of GRB afterglows with

the cavity during the CNOT may increase the experimental difficulty in
obtaining long-distance entanglement distribution using these systems. We
analyse and compare a number of cavity-based repeater schemes combining various

The heralded gate moves the effect of dissipation from the fidelity to the
success probability of the gate thereby enabling high-fidelity entanglement
swapping. As a result, high-rate entanglement distribution can be achieved over
long distances even for low cooperativities of the atom-cavity systems. This

background models have been proposed and achieved promising performance on
public data sets. However, due to challenges such as illumination change,
dynamic background etc. the resulted foreground segmentation often consists of
holes as well as background noise. In this regard, we consider generalized
fused lasso regularization to quest for intact structured foregrounds. Together
with certain assumptions about the background, such as the low-rank assumption
or the sparse-composition assumption (depending on whether pure background
frames are provided), we formulate BS as a matrix decomposition problem using
regularization terms for both the foreground and background matrices. Moreover,
under the proposed formulation, the two generally distinctive background
assumptions can be solved in a unified manner. The optimization was carried out
via applying the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) method in such a way that
a fast parametric-flow algorithm is used for updating the foreground matrix.
Experimental results on several popular BS data sets demonstrate the advantage
of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-arts.

rely on the directly observable surface brightness and velocity dispersion
profiles, without invoking computationally expensive detailed modeling. These
methods recover the mass at a specific radius where the mass estimate is
expected to be least sensitive to the anisotropy of stellar orbits. One method
(Wolf et al. 2010) uses the total luminosity-weighted velocity dispersion and
evaluates the mass at a 3D half-light radius $r_{1/2}$, i.e., it depends on the
GLOBAL galaxy properties. Another approach (Churazov et al. 2010) estimates the
mass from the velocity dispersion at a radius $R_2$ where the surface
brightness declines as $R^{-2}$, i.e., it depends on the LOCAL properties. We
evaluate the accuracy of the two methods for analytical models, simulated
galaxies and real elliptical galaxies that have already been modeled by the
Schwarzschild's orbit-superposition technique. Both estimators recover an
almost unbiased circular speed estimate with a modest RMS scatter ($\lesssim 10
\%$). Tests on analytical models and simulated galaxies indicate that the local
estimator has a smaller RMS scatter than the global one. We show by examination
of simulated galaxies that the projected velocity dispersion at $R_2$ could
serve as a good proxy for the virial galaxy mass. For simulated galaxies the
total halo mass scales with $\sigma_p(R_2)$ as $M_{vir}

channels is considered. While this channel has attracted a significant
attention recently and a number of results have been obtained, including the
proof of the optimality of Gaussian signalling, an optimal transmit covariance
matrix is known for some special cases only and the general case remains an
open problem. An iterative custom-made algorithm to find a globally-optimal
transmit covariance matrix in the general case is developed in this paper, with
guaranteed convergence to a \textit{global} optimum. While the original
optimization problem is not convex and hence difficult to solve, its minimax
reformulation can be solved via the convex optimization tools, which is
exploited here. The proposed algorithm is based on the barrier method extended
to deal with a minimax problem at hand. Its convergence to a global optimum is
proved for the general case (degraded or not) and a bound for the optimality
gap is given for each step of the barrier method. The performance of the
algorithm is demonstrated via numerical examples. In particular, 20 to 40
Newton steps are already sufficient to solve the sufficient optimality
conditions with very high precision (up to the machine precision level), even
for large systems. Even fewer steps are required if the secrecy capacity is the
only quantity of interest. The algorithm can be significantly simplified for
the degraded channel case and can also be adopted to include the per-antenna
power constraints (instead or in addition to the total power constraint). It
also solves the dual problem of minimizing the total power subject to the
secrecy rate constraint.

at about 45 and 100 keV, respectively. Unlike similar sources, no significant
variations of the energy of its cyclotron lines with flux were observed to
date. The bright outburst of February 2011 thus offers a unique occasion to
probe this peculiar behavior at flux levels not yet observed with present-day
instruments. Here we report on the spectral and timing analysis of the data
from the spectrometer SPI on-board INTEGRAL collected during the outburst. At
the peak of the outburst the estimated luminosity is ~4.9x10^37 erg/s. The
fundamental cyclotron feature is detected at all flux levels, and its centroid
energy is positively-correlated with the flux of the source, confirming that
A0535+26 is accreting at a sub-critical regime. The correlation seems to fall
off at ~10^37 erg/s, suggesting the transition from a Coulomb-stopping regime
to a gas-mediated shock regime. From the timing analysis we found that the
pulsar was spinning up during most of the outburst, and that the spin-up rate
correlates with the flux of the source, albeit the correlation is steeper than
the one expected from the standard disk accretion theory. Finally, we show that
the pulse profile of the source changes dramatically as the flux increases. At
high luminosity the profile is highly asymmetric, implying an asymmetry in the
geometry of the accretion flow.

on line $i$, and is assumed to be given by $C_i=(1+\alpha)L_i$, with
$\alpha>0$. We study the robustness of this power system against random attacks
(or, failures) that target a $p$-{\em fraction} of the lines, under a
democratic fiber bundle-like model. Namely, when a line fails, the load it was
carrying is redistributed equally among the remaining lines. Our contributions
are as follows: i) we show analytically that the final breakdown of the system
always takes place through a first-order transition at the critical attack size
$p^{\star}=1-\frac{E[L]}{\max\{P(L>x)(\alpha x + E[L ~|~ L>x])\}}~~~$; ii) we
derive conditions on the distribution $P_L(x)$ for which the first order break
down of the system occurs abruptly without any preceding diverging rate of
failure; iii) we provide a detailed analysis of the robustness of the system
under three specific load distributions: Uniform, Pareto, and Weibull, showing
that with the minimum load $L_{\textrm{min}}$ and mean load $E[L]$ fixed,
Pareto distribution is the worst (in terms of robustness) among the three,
whereas Weibull distribution is the best with shape parameter selected
relatively large; iv) we provide numerical results that confirm our mean-field
analysis; and v) we show that $p^{\star}$ is maximized when the load
distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at $E[L]$, i.e., when all lines
carry the same load; we also show that optimal $p^{\star}$ equals
$\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+1}$. This last finding is particularly surprising given
that heterogeneity is known to lead to high robustness against random failures
in many other systems.

dimensional homogeneous porous medium has been investigated. The linearized
perturbed equations for Darcy's law coupled with a convection-diffusion

value problem is solved by fourth order Runge-Kutta method, followed by a
singular value decomposition of the propagator matrix. Particular attention is
given to the transient behavior rather than the long-time behavior of
eigenmodes predicted by the traditional modal analysis. The transient behaviors
of the response to external excitations and the response to initial conditions
are studied by examining the $\epsilon-$pseudospectra structures and the
largest energy growth function. With the help of non-modal stability analysis
we demonstrate that at early times the displacement flow is dominated by
diffusion and the perturbations decay. At later times, when convection
dominates diffusion, perturbations grow. Furthermore, we show that the dominant
perturbation that experiences the maximum amplification within the linear
regime lead to the transient growth. These two important features were
previously unattainable in the existing linear stability methods for miscible
viscous fingering. To explore the relevance of the optimal perturbation
obtained from non-modal analysis, we performed direct numerical simulations
using a highly accurate pseudo-spectral method. Further, a comparison of the
present stability analysis with existing modal and initial value approach is
also presented. It is shown that the non-modal stability results are in better

access, platforms enforce permission systems that allow users to regulate how
applications access protected resources. If users are asked to make security
decisions too frequently and in benign situations, they may become habituated
and approve all future requests without regard for the consequences. If they
are asked to make too few security decisions, they may become concerned that
the platform is revealing too much sensitive information. To explore this
tradeoff, we instrumented the Android platform to collect data regarding how
often and under what circumstances smartphone applications are accessing
protected resources regulated by permissions. We performed a 36-person field
study to explore the notion of ""contextual integrity,"" that is, how often are
applications accessing protected resources when users are not expecting it?
Based on our collection of 27 million data points and exit interviews with
participants, we examine the situations in which users would like the ability
to deny applications access to protected resources. We found out that at least
80% of our participants would have preferred to prevent at least one permission
request, and overall, they thought that over a third of requests were invasive
and desired a mechanism to block them.

  reduction","Submitted to Journal of Computational Physics",,,,"cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Least-squares Petrov--Galerkin (LSPG) model-reduction techniques such as the
Gauss--Newton with Approximated Tensors (GNAT) method have shown promise, as
they have generated stable, accurate solutions for large-scale turbulent,
compressible flow problems where standard Galerkin techniques have failed.
However, there has been limited comparative analysis of the two approaches.
This is due in part to difficulties arising from the fact that Galerkin
techniques perform optimal projection associated with residual minimization at
the time-continuous level, while LSPG techniques do so at the time-discrete
level. This work provides a detailed theoretical and computational comparison
of the two techniques for two common classes of time integrators: linear
multistep schemes and Runge--Kutta schemes. We present a number of new
findings, including conditions under which the LSPG ROM has a time-continuous
representation, conditions under which the two techniques are equivalent, and
time-discrete error bounds for the two approaches. Perhaps most surprisingly,
we demonstrate both theoretically and computationally that decreasing the time
step does not necessarily decrease the error for the LSPG ROM; instead, the
time step should be `matched' to the spectral content of the reduced basis. In
numerical experiments carried out on a turbulent compressible-flow problem with
over one million unknowns, we show that increasing the time step to an
intermediate value decreases both the error and the simulation time of the LSPG
reduced-order model by an order of magnitude.

Historical light and velocity curves from 1962 to 2012 were simultaneously
analyzed with the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) synthesis code. The brightness
disturbances were satisfactorily modeled by applying a magnetic cool spot on
the primary star. Based on 261 times of minimum light including 116 new timings
and spanning more than 87 yrs, a period study reveals that the orbital period
has varied due to a periodic oscillation superposed on an upward parabola. The
period and semi-amplitude of the modulation are about 78.1 yrs and 0.0037 d,
respectively. This detail is interpreted as a light-travel-time effect due to a
circumbinary companion with a minimum mass of $M_3$=0.065 $M_\odot$, within the
theoretical limit of $\sim$0.07 M$_\odot$ for a brown dwarf star. The observed
period increase at a fractional rate of $+$2.74 $\times $10$^{-10}$ is in
excellent agreement with that calculated from our W-D synthesis. Mass transfer
from the secondary to the primary component is mainly responsible for the
secular period change. We examined the evolutionary status of the DK Cyg system

between 0.1 TeV and 100 TeV using data from the first year of the complete

produced in cosmic-ray air showers. This analysis selects 1078 fully contained
events in 332 days of livetime, then identifies those consistent with particle
showers. A likelihood analysis with improved event selection extends our
previous measurement of the conventional $\nu_e$ fluxes to higher energies. The
data constrain the conventional $\nu_e$ flux to be $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ times a
baseline prediction from a Honda's calculation, including the knee of the
cosmic-ray spectrum. A fit to the kaon contribution ($\xi$) to the neutrino
flux finds a kaon component that is $\xi =1.3^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ times the baseline
value. The fitted/measured prompt neutrino flux from charmed hadron decays
strongly depends on the assumed astrophysical flux and shape. If the
astrophysical component follows a power law, the result for the prompt flux is
$0.0^{+3.0}_{-0.0}$ times a calculated flux based on the work by Enberg, Reno
and Sarcevic.

networks, where users are mainly interested in retrieving content stored in the
network, rather than in maintaining source-destination communication. Nodes are
assumed to be uniformly distributed in the network area. Each node has a
limited-capacity content store, which it uses to cache contents. We propose an
achievable caching and transmission scheme whereby requesters retrieve content
from the caching point which is closest in Euclidean distance. We establish the
throughput and delay scaling of the achievable scheme, and show that the
throughput and delay performance are order-optimal within a class of schemes.
We then solve the caching optimization problem, and evaluate the network
performance for a Zipf content popularity distribution, letting the number of
content types and the network size both go to infinity. Finally, we extend our
analysis to heterogeneous wireless networks where, in addition to wireless
nodes, there are a number of base stations uniformly distributed at random in
the network area. We show that in order to achieve a better performance in a
heterogeneous network in the order sense, the number of base stations needs to
be greater than the ratio of the number of nodes to the number of content
types. Furthermore, we show that the heterogeneous network does not yield
performance advantages in the order sense if the Zipf content popularity

a central theme in topological data analysis. \textsf{Mapper}, a tool for such
summarization, takes as input both a possibly high dimensional dataset and a
map defined on the data, and produces a summary of the data by using a cover of
the codomain of the map. This cover, via a pullback operation to the domain,
produces a simplicial complex connecting the data points.
  The resulting view of the data through a cover of the codomain offers
flexibility in analyzing the data. However, it offers only a view at a fixed
scale at which the cover is constructed. Inspired by the concept, we explore a
notion of a tower of covers which induces a tower of simplicial complexes
connected by simplicial maps, which we call {\em multiscale mapper}. We study
the resulting structure, its stability, and design practical algorithms to
compute its associated persistence diagrams efficiently. Specifically, when the
domain is a simplicial complex and the map is a real-valued piecewise-linear
function, the algorithm can compute the exact persistence diagram only from the
1-skeleton of the input complex. For general maps, we present a combinatorial
version of the algorithm that acts only on \emph{vertex sets} connected by the
1-skeleton graph, and this algorithm approximates the exact persistence diagram
thanks to a stability result that we show to hold. We also relate the
multiscale mapper with the \v{C}ech complexes arising from a natural pullback
pseudometric defined on the input domain.

understood from statistical mechanics as an entropic force, but little is known
about the underlying force distribution. Here, we introduce two phase space
sampling methods that can produce the equilibrium distribution of instantaneous
forces exerted by a terminally pinned polymer. In these methods, both the
positions and momenta of mass points representing a freely jointed chain are
perturbed in accordance with the spatial constraints and the Boltzmann
distribution of total energy. The constraint force for each conformation and
momentum is calculated using Lagrangian dynamics. Using terminally pinned
chains in space and on a surface, we show that the force distribution is highly
asymmetric with both tensile and compressive forces. Most importantly, the mean
of the distribution, which is equal to the entropic force, is not the most
probable force even for long chains. Our work provides insights into the
mechanistic origin of entropic forces, and an efficient computational tool for
unbiased sampling of the phase space of a constrained system.

be produced during the reheating period instead of when the Universe is

characterised by radio flux densities between tenths and tens of mJy and faint
or absent infrared counterparts. It has been suggested that these objects are
radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at significant redshifts (z >~ 2).
Whereas the high redshifts of IFRS have been recently confirmed based on
spectroscopic data, the evidence for the presence of AGNs in IFRS is mainly
indirect. So far, only two AGNs have been unquestionably confirmed in IFRS
based on very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations. In this work,
we test the hypothesis that IFRS contain AGNs in a large sample of sources
using VLBI. We observed 57 IFRS with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) down
to a detection sensitivity in the sub-mJy regime and detected compact cores in
35 sources. Our VLBA detections increase the number of VLBI-detected IFRS from
2 to 37 and provide strong evidence that most - if not all - IFRS contain AGNs.
We find that IFRS have a marginally higher VLBI detection fraction than
randomly selected sources with mJy flux densities at arcsec-scales. Moreover,
our data provide a positive correlation between compactness - defined as the
ratio of milliarcsec- to arcsec-scale flux density - and redshift for IFRS, but
suggest a decreasing mean compactness with increasing arcsec-scale radio flux
density. Based on these findings, we suggest that IFRS tend to contain young
AGNs whose jets have not formed yet or have not expanded, equivalent to very
compact objects. We found two IFRS that are resolved into two components. The
two components are spatially separated by a few hundred milliarcseconds in both
cases. They might be components of one AGN, a binary black hole, or the result
of gravitational lensing.

precoder/combiner of a large dimension. The constant amplitude constraint of
analog RF processing results in the matrix decomposition problem non-convex.
Based on an alternate optimization technique, the non-convex matrix
decomposition problem can be decoupled into a series of convex sub-problems and
effectively solved by restricting the phase increment of each entry in the RF
precoder/combiner within a small vicinity of its preceding iterate. A singular
value decomposition based technique is proposed to secure an initial point
sufficiently close to the global solution of the original non-convex problem.
Through simulation, the convergence of the alternate optimization for such a
matrix decomposition based hybrid processing (MD-HP) scheme is examined, and
the performance of the MD-HP scheme is demonstrated to be near-optimal.

model-independent manner. The new physics effects are summarized as four
independent couplings $f_1^L$, $f_1^R$, $f_2^L$ and $f_2^R$. Using
single-top-quark productions and W-helicity fraction measurements at the LHC
and Tevatron, we perform a global fit to impose constraints on top quark
effective couplings. We introduce a set of parameters $x_0$, $x_m$, $x_p$ and
$x_5$ to study the correlations among Wtb effective couplings. We show that (i)
improving the measurements of $\sigma_t$ and $\sigma_{tW}$ is important in
constraining the correlation of $(f_1^R,f_2^R)$ and $(f_2^L,f_2^R)$; (ii)
$f_1^L$ and $f_2^R$ are anti-correlated, which is sensitive to all the
experiments; (iii) $f_1^R$ and $f_2^L$ are also anti-correlated, which is
sensitive to the W-helicity measurements; (iv) the correlation between $f_2^L$
and $f_2^R$ is sensitive to the precision of $\sigma_t$, $\sigma_{tW}$ and
$F_0$ measurements. The effective Wtb couplings are studied in three kinds of
new physics models: $SU(2)_1 \times SU(2)_2 \times U(1)_X$ models, vector-like
quark models and Littlest Higgs model with and without T-parity. The Wtb
couplings in the left-right model and the un-unified model are sensitive to the
ratio of gauge couplings when the new heavy gauge boson's mass ($M_{W'}$) is
less than several hundred GeV, but the constraint is loose if $M_{W'}>1$ TeV.
The Wtb couplings in vector-like quark models and the Littlest Higgs models are
sensitive to the mixing angles of new heavy particles and SM particles. We also
include the constraints of the oblique T-parameter and Zbb couplings which
impose much tighter constraints on the mixing angles. We show that the Wtb
coupling constraints become relevant if the precision of single top production
cross section measurements could be reduced to 1\% relative to the SM
predictions in future.

which are determined by three characteristic lengths: the mean free path
$l_{\tau}$, the Zeeman oscillation length $l_{\Omega}$ and the spin-orbit
coupling oscillation length $l_{\alpha}$. It is analytically revealed and
numerically confirmed that by tuning the scattering strength, the system can be
divided into {\it five} regimes: I, weak scattering regime ($l_{\tau}\gtrsim
l_{\Omega}, l_{\alpha}$); II, Zeeman field-dominated moderate scattering regime

$zeta$ function (which is essentially an antiderivative of the Weierstrass
$\wp$ function) plays a prominent role. Although it is not an elliptic
function, Eisenstein constructed a simple (non-holomorphic) completion of this
form which is doubly periodic. This theorem has begun to play an important role
in the theory of harmonic Maass forms, and was crucial to work of Guerzhoy as
well as Alfes, Griffin, Ono, and the author. In particular, this simple
completion of $\zeta$ provides a powerful method to construct harmonic Maass
forms of weight zero which serve as canonical lifts under the differential
operator $\xi_{0}$ of weight 2 cusp forms, and this has been shown in to have
deep applications to determining vanishing criteria for central values and
derivatives of twisted Hasse-Weil $L$-functions for elliptic curves.
  Here we offer a new and motivated proof of Eisenstein's theorem, relying on
the basic theory of differential operators for Jacobi forms together with a
classical identity for the first quasi-period of a lattice. A quick inspection
of the proof shows that it also allows one to easily construct more general
non-holomorphic elliptic functions.

we reinvestigate the generation of magnetic fields at second-order in

newly taking into account the time evolution of purely second-order vector

that the amplitude of magnetic fields from the product-terms of the first-order

find, both numerically and analytically, that the magnetic fields from the
purely second-order vector perturbations partially cancel out the magnetic
fields from one of the product-terms of the first-order scalar modes, in the
tight coupling regime in the radiation dominated era. Therefore, the amplitude
of the magnetic fields on small scales, $k \gtrsim 10~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, is
smaller than the previous estimates. The amplitude of the generated magnetic
fields at cosmological recombination is about $B_{\rm rec} =5.0\times

the spectral efficiency by exploiting diversity gains. In this regard,
proportional fair (PF) scheduling provides a solution for increasing the users'
quality of experience by finding a balance between system throughput
maximization and user fairness. For this purpose, precise instantaneous channel
state information (CSI) needs to be available at the transmitter side to
perform rate adaptation and scheduling. However, in practical setups, CSI is
impaired by, e.g., channel estimation errors, quantization and feedback delays.
Especially in centralized cloud based communication systems, where main parts
of the lower layer processing is shifted to a central entity, high backhaul
latency can cause substantial CSI imperfections, resulting in significant
performance degradations. In this work robust rate adaptation as well as robust

statistics with the correlation function $\langle vv\rangle \propto
\delta(t-t') \, k^{-d-\xi}$, where $k$ is the wave number and $0<\xi<2$ is a
free parameter. Effects of compressibility of the fluid are studied. Using the
field theoretic renormalization group we show that, depending on the relation
between the exponent $\xi$ and the spatial dimension $d$, the system reveals
different types of large-scale, long-time asymptotic behaviour, associated with
four possible fixed points of the renormalization group equations. In addition
to known regimes (ordinary diffusion, ordinary growth process, and passively
advected scalar field), existence of a new nonequilibrium universality class is
established. Practical calculations of the fixed point coordinates, their
regions of stability and critical dimensions are calculated to the first order
of the double expansion in $\xi$ and $\varepsilon=2-d$ (one-loop
approximation). It turns out that for incompressible fluid, the most realistic
values $\xi=4/3$ or 2 and $d=1$ or 2 correspond to the case of passive scalar
field, when the nonlinearity of the KPZ model is irrelevant and the interface
growth is completely determined by the turbulent transfer. If the
compressibility becomes strong enough, the crossover in the critical behaviour
occurs, and these values of $d$ and $\xi$ fall into the region of stability of
the new regime, where the advection and the nonlinearity are both important.

defined by a short-range attraction plus a longer-range repulsion. We consider
thermodynamic states corresponding to self-assembly into clusters. Both, fixed
and adaptive boundaries are studied. For fixed boundaries, there are particular
states in which, for equal average densities, the number of clusters in the GCE
is larger than in the Canonical Ensemble. The dependence of pressure on density
has a different form when the system size changes with fixed number of
particles and when the number of particles changes with fixed size of the
system. In the former case the pressure has a nonmonotonic dependence on the
system size. The anomalous increase of pressure for expanding system is
accompanied by formation of a larger number of smaller clusters. In the case of
elastic confining surfaces we observe a bistability, i.e. two significantly
different system sizes occur with almost the same probability. The mechanism of
the bistability in the closed system is different to that of the case of

ultracold Fermi gas. The key of our idea is that the pairing symmetry of a
Fermi superfluid is fully dominated by the symmetry of the superfluid order
parameter, which is essentially given by the product of a pair amplitude and a
pairing interaction. Noting this, in our proposal, we first prepare a $p$-wave
pair amplitude by, not using a $p$-wave interaction, but using the phenomenon
that a $p$-wave pair amplitude is induced in an $s$-wave superfluid Fermi gas
with antisymmetric spin-orbit interaction. In this case, although the system is
still in the $s$-wave superfluid state with the $s$-wave superfluid order
parameter, when one suddenly replaces the $s$-wave interaction by an
appropriate $p$-wave one (which is possible in cold Fermi gases by using a
Feshbach resonance technique), the product of the $p$-wave interaction and the
$p$-wave pair amplitude that has already been prepared in the spin-orbit
coupled $s$-wave superfluid state immediately gives a finite $p$-wave
superfluid order parameter. Thus, at least just after this manipulation, the
system is in the $p$-wave superfluid state, being characterized by the
artificially produced $p$-wave superfluid parameter. In this paper, to assess
our idea, we evaluate the $p$-wave pair amplitude in a spin-orbit coupled
$s$-wave superfluid Fermi gas at $T=0$. We determine the region where a large
$p$-wave pair amplitude is obtained in the phase diagram with respect to the
strengths of the $s$-wave pairing interaction and the spin-orbit coupling. We
also discuss the accessibility of this optimal region on the viewpoint of the
superfluid phase transition temperature. Since the achievement of a $p$-wave
superfluid Fermi gas is one of the most crucial issues in cold atom physics,
our proposal would be useful for this exciting challenge.

heterostructures. The mutual Coulomb interaction of the electron-hole pair and
the electrostatic potentials generated by external gates and acting on the two
particles separately are taken into account exactly in the two-particle
dynamics. As relevant examples, step/downhill and barrier/well potential
profiles are considered. The space- and time-dependent evolution during the
scattering event as well as the asymptotic time behavior are analyzed. For
typical parameters of GaAs-based devices the transmission or reflection of the
pair turns out to be a complex two-particle process, due to comparable and
competing Coulomb, electrostatic and kinetic energy scales. Depending on the
intensity and anisotropy of the scattering potentials, the quantum evolution
may result in excitation of the IX internal degrees of freedom, dissociation of
the pair, or transmission in small periodic IX wavepackets due to dwelling of
one particle in the barrier region. We discuss the occurrence of each process
in the full parameter space of the scattering potentials and the relevance of
our results for current excitronic technologies.

representation of the global particle phase space structure while decreasing or
increasing the entire particle population, based on k-means clustering of the
data. In essence the procedure amounts to merging or splitting particles by
statistical means, throughout the entire simulation volume in question, while
minimizing a 6-dimensional total distance measure to preserve the physics.
Particle merging is by far the most demanding procedure when considering
conservation laws of physics; it amounts to lossy compression of particle phase
space data. We demonstrate that our k-means approach conserves energy and
momentum to high accuracy, even for high compression ratios, $\mathcal{R}
\approx 3$ --- \emph{i.e.}, $N_{f} \lesssim 0.33N_{i}$. Interestingly, we find
that an accurate particle splitting step can be performed using k-means as
well; this from an argument of symmetry. The split solution, using k-means,
places splitted particles optimally, to obtain maximal spanning on the phase
space manifold. Implementation and testing is done using an electromagnetic PIC
code, the \ppcode. Nonetheless, the k-means framework is general; it is not
limited to Vlasov-Maxwell type PIC codes. We discuss advantages and drawbacks
of this optimal phase space reconstruction.

$10^{4}\,\mu$m, depending on molecular size. These spectra are discrete but
large assemblies of molecules of the same family, differing only by minor
structural details, will produce continua. As such assemblies are expected to
exist in regions where dust accumulates, they are bound to contribute to the
observed continua underlying the Unidentified Infrared Bands and the 21-mum
band of planetary nebulae as well as to the diffuse galactic emission surveyed
by the Planck astronomical satellite and other means. The purpose of this work
is to determine, for carbon-rich molecules, the intensity of such continua and
their extent into the millimetric range, and to evaluate their detectability in
this range. The rules governing the spectral distributions of phonons are
derived and shown to differ from those which obtain in the solid state. Their
application allow the extinction cross-section per H atom, and its maximum
wavelength, to be determined as a function of molecular size and

these results. It is found that the maximum phonon wavelength of a 2D structure

generalize Schur polynomials, and form a linear basis of multivariate
polynomials. In 2003, Lenart and Sottile introduced skew Schubert polynomials,
which generalize skew Schur polynomials, and expand in the Schubert basis with
the generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
  In this paper we initiate the study of these two families of polynomials from
the perspective of computational complexity theory. We first observe that skew
Schubert polynomials, and therefore Schubert polynomials, are in $\CountP$
(when evaluating on non-negative integral inputs) and $\VNP$.
  Our main result is a deterministic algorithm that computes the expansion of a
polynomial $f$ of degree $d$ in $\Z[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ in the basis of Schubert
polynomials, assuming an oracle computing Schubert polynomials. This algorithm
runs in time polynomial in $n$, $d$, and the bit size of the expansion. This
generalizes, and derandomizes, the sparse interpolation algorithm of symmetric
polynomials in the Schur basis by Barvinok and Fomin (Advances in Applied
Mathematics, 18(3):271--285). In fact, our interpolation algorithm is general
enough to accommodate any linear basis satisfying certain natural properties.
  Applications of the above results include a new algorithm that computes the

a significant relieve of the fermion sign problem. To benchmark the capability
of our method regarding the simulation of degenerate fermions, we consider
multiple electrons in a quantum dot and compare our results with other ab

Helmholtz energy can be easily calculated from simple molecular and physical
properties. We propose that these values for entropy are employed both
chemically for reactions and physically for computing atmospheric profiles, the
latter based on steady state heat flow equilibrating thermodynamics with

Here, we show that the association of both biologically inspired network

with natural images, the neurons in the entry layers detect edges, and the most

spike timing-dependent plasticity. These neurons progressively become selective
to intermediate complexity visual features appropriate for object
categorization. The model is evaluated on 3D-Object and ETH-80 datasets which
are two benchmarks for invariant object recognition, and is shown to outperform
state-of-the-art models, including DeepConvNet and HMAX. This demonstrates its
ability to accurately recognize different instances of multiple object classes
even under various appearance conditions (different views, scales, tilts, and

maintaining many of LTL's desirable properties like intuitive syntax and
semantics and a translation into non-deterministic B\""uchi automata of
exponential size. But LDL lacks capabilities to express timing constraints. By
adding parameterized operators to LDL, we obtain a logic that is able to

complete for these complexity classes. Moreover, we give tight upper and lower
bounds on optimal parameter values for model checking and realizability. Using

equations obtained by Busse in 1968. So far however, no analytical result on
the solutions is available. Moreover, the cases where multiple flows can
coexist have not been investigated in details since their discovery by Noir et

where multiple solutions exist, and second studying quantitatively their
stability. Using the models recently proposed by Noir \& C{\'e}bron (2013),
which are more generic in the inviscid limit than the equations of Busse, we
analytically describe these solutions, their conditions of existence, and their
stability in a systematic manner. We then successfully compare these analytical
results with the theory of Busse (1968). Dynamical model equations are finally
proposed to investigate the stability of the solutions, which allows to
describe the bifurcation of the unstable flow solution. We also report for the
first time the possibility that time-dependent multiple flows can coexist in
precessing triaxial ellipsoids. Numerical integrations of the algebraic and

potential simultaneously and self-consistently. The paramagnetic phase of
spin-singlet $d$-wave superconducting disks is drastically suppressed by the
surface roughness, whereas that of spin-triplet $p$-wave disks is robust even
in the presence of the roughness. Such difference derives from the orbital
symmetry of paramagnetic odd-frequency Cooper pairs appearing at the surface of
disks. The orbital part of the paramagnetic pairing correlation is $p$-wave
symmetry in the $d$-wave disks, whereas it is $s$-wave symmetry in the $p$-wave
ones. Calculating the free-energy, we also confirm that the paramagnetic state
is more stable than the normal state, which indicates a possibility of
detecting the paramagnetic effect in experiments. Indeed our results are
consistent with an experimental finding on high-$T_c$ thin films.

is determined through large scale computer simulations. Defects in the packing
are shown generically to occur most often in regions of strong curvature;
however, the relationship between defects and curvature is nontrivial, and the
distribution of defects shows secondary maxima for ellipsoids of sufficiently
high aspect ratio. As with packings on spherical surfaces, additional defects
beyond those required by topology are observed as chains or 'scars'. The
transition point, however, is found to be softened by the anisotropic curvature

account for the scarcity of perfect channel state information (CSI) in massive

Blandford & Znajek (1977), the spin energy of a rotating black hole can be

monolayers by circularly polarized light selectively creates electron-hole
pairs or excitons in non-equivalent valleys in momentum space, depending on the

carriers and Coulomb complexes by means of optical spectroscopy. Here we
present a concise review of the neutral exciton fine structure and its spin and

demonstrated that the long-range exchange interaction between an electron and a
hole in the exciton is an efficient mechanism for rapid mixing between bright
excitons made of electron-hole pairs in different valleys. We discuss the
physical origin of the long-range exchange interaction and outline its
derivation in both the electrodynamical and $\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf p$

by an interplay between the long-range exchange interaction and scattering.

flow under controlled normal stress $P$ in the presence of a small amount of an

dimensionless control parameters: inertial number $I$ and reduced pressure
$P^*=aP/(\pi\Gamma)$, comparing confining forces $\sim a^2P$ to meniscus
tensile strength $F_0=\pi\Gamma a$, for grains of diameter $a$ joined by
menisci with surface tension $\Gamma$. We pay special attention to the
quasi-static limit of slow flow and observe systematic, enduring strain
localization in some of the cohesion-dominated ($P^*\sim 0.1$) systems.
Homogeneous steady flows are characterized by the dependence of internal
friction coefficient $\mu^*$ and solid fraction $\Phi$ on $I$ and $P^*$. We
record fairly small but not negligible normal stress differences and the
moderate sensitivity of the system to saturation within the pendular regime.
Capillary forces have a significant effect on the macroscopic behavior of the
system, up to $P^*$ values of several units. The concept of effective pressure
may be used to predict an order of magnitude for the strong increase of $\mu^*$
as $P^*$ decreases but such a crude approach is unable to account for the
complex structural changes induced by capillary cohesion. Likewise, the
Mohr-Coulomb criterion for pressure-dependent critical states is, at best, an
approximation valid within a restricted range of pressures, with $P^*\ge 1$. At
small enough $P^*$, large clusters of interacting grains form in slow flows, in
which liquid bonds survive shear strains of several units. This affects the
anisotropies associated to different interactions, and the shape of function
$\mu^*(I)$, which departs more slowly from its quasistatic limit than in
cohesionless systems.

Guruswami, H{\aa}stad, Harsha, Srinivasan and Varma showed that it is
quasi-NP-hard to color 2-colorable 8-uniform hypergraphs with
$2^{2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log\log N})}}$ colors. Their result is obtained by
composing standard Label Cover with an inner-verifier based on Low Degree Long
Code, using Reed-Muller code testing results by Dinur and Guruswami. Using a
different approach, Khot and Saket constructed a new variant of Label Cover,
and composed it with Quadratic Code to show quasi-NP-hardness of coloring
2-colorable 12-uniform hypergraphs with $2^{(\log N)^c}$ colors, for some $c$
around 1/20. Their construction of Label Cover is based on a new notion of
superposition complexity for CSP instances. The composition with inner-verifier
was subsequently improved by Varma, giving the same hardness result for
8-uniform hypergraphs.
  Our construction uses both Quadratic Code and Low Degree Long Code, and
builds upon the work by Khot and Saket. We present a different approach to
construct CSP instances with superposition hardness by observing that when the
number of assignments is odd, satisfying a constraint in superposition is the
same as ""odd-covering"" the constraint. We employ Low Degree Long Code in order
to keep the construction efficient. In the analysis, we also adapt and
generalize one of the key theorems by Dinur and Guruswami in the context of
analyzing probabilistically checkable proof systems.

analyze previously published Band 7 observations of a disk in 12CO 3--2 line

HD135344B, LkCa15, SR24S and RXJ1615-3255 (Band 9) and J1604-2130 (Band 7). The
SED and continuum visibility curve constrain the dust surface density.
Subsequently, the same model is used to calculate the 12CO emission, which is
compared with the observations through spectra and intensity cuts. The amount
of gas inside the cavity is quantified by varying the delta-gas parameter.
Model fits to the dust and gas indicate that gas is still present inside the
dust cavity for all disks but at a reduced level. The gas surface density drops
inside the cavity by at least a factor 10, whereas the dust density drops by at
least a factor 1000. Disk masses are comparable with previous estimates from
the literature, cavity radii are found to be smaller than in the 345 GHz

suggest clearing of the cavity by one or more companions in all cases, trapping
the millimeter-sized dust at the edge of the cavity.

layers of gas and dust, elongated columns or pillars of gas pointing towards
the ionizing sources, and cometary globules of dense gas, where triggered star
formation can occur. Understanding the interplay between the ionizing radiation
and the dense surrounding gas is very important to explain the origin of these
peculiar structures, and hence to characterize triggered star formation.
G46.5-0.2 (G46), a poorly studied galactic HII region located at about 4 kpc,
is an excellent target to perform this kind of studies. Using public molecular
data extracted from the Galactic Ring Survey (13CO J=1-0) and from the James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope data archive (12CO, 13CO, C18O J=3-2, HCO+ and HCN
J=4-3), and infrared data from the GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL surveys, we perform a
complete study of G46, its molecular environment and the young stellar objects
placed around it. We found that G46, probably excited by an O7V star, is
located close to the edge of the GRSMC G046.34-00.21 molecular cloud. It
presents a horse-shoe morphology opening in direction of the cloud. We observed
a filamentary structure in the molecular gas likely related to G46 and not
considerable molecular emission towards its open border. We found that about
10' towards the southwest of G46 there are some pillar-like features, shining
at 8 um and pointing towards the HII region open border. We propose that the
pillar-like features were carved and sculpted by the ionizing flux from G46. We
found several young stellar objects likely embedded in the molecular cloud
grouped in two main concentrations: one, closer to the G46 open border
consisting of Class II type sources, and other one mostly composed by Class I
type YSOs located just ahead the pillars-like features, strongly suggesting an
age gradient in the YSOs distribution.

method to a spatially developing unstable system and show that it results in
reduced-order models of similar quality to the ones obtained with existing
methods. Due to the unbounded growth of unstable modes, a practical restriction
on the final impulse response simulation time appears, which can be adjusted
depending on the desired order of the reduced-order model. Recommendations are
given to further reduce the cost of the method if the system is large and to
improve the performance of the method if it does not yield acceptable results
in its unmodified form. Finally, the method is applied to the linearized flow
around a cylinder at Re = 100 to show that it actually is able to accurately
reproduce impulse responses for more realistic unstable large-scale systems in

framework can therefore be safely applied to unstable systems without any

obtained even for large systems, where the computational cost of existing

couples with matter to mediate a fifth force. If it exists, this fifth force
would influence the hot X-ray emitting gas filling the potential wells of
galaxy clusters. However, it would not influence the clusters' weak lensing
signal. Therefore, by comparing X-ray and weak lensing profiles, one can place
upper limits on the strength of a fifth force. This technique has been
attempted before using a single, nearby cluster (Coma, $z=0.02$). Here we apply
the technique to the stacked profiles of 58 clusters at higher redshifts
($0.1<z<1.2$), including 12 new to the literature, using X-ray data from the
XMM Cluster Survey (XCS) and weak lensing data from the Canada France Hawaii

constrain the two chameleon gravity parameters ($\beta$ and $\phi_{\infty}$).
Our fits are consistent with general relativity, not requiring a fifth force.
In the special case of $f(R)$ gravity (where $\beta = \sqrt{1/6}$), we set an
upper limit on the background field amplitude today of $|f_{\rm{R0}}| < 6

$|f_{\rm{R0}}|$ on cosmological scales. We hope to improve this constraint in

sequence to $\sim 3\, 000$ K on the white dwarf cooling curve, passing through
all intermediate stages. During the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch
no third dredge-up episodes are considered and thus the photospheric C/O ratio
is below unity for sequences with metallicities larger than $Z=0.0001$. We
consider initial metallicities from $Z=0.0001$ to $Z=0.04$, accounting for
stellar populations in the galactic disk and halo, with initial masses below
$\sim 3M_{\odot}$. We found a clear dependence of the shape of the
initial$-$to$-$final mass relation with the progenitor metallicity, where metal
rich progenitors result in less massive white dwarf remnants, due to an
enhancement of the mass loss rates associated to high metallicity values. By
comparing our theoretical computations with semi empirical data from globular
and old open clusters, we found that the observed intrinsic mass spread can be
accounted for by a set of initial$-$to$-$final mass relations characterized by
different metallicity values. Also, we confirm that the lifetime spent before
the white dwarf stage increases with metallicity. Finally, we estimate the mean
mass at the top of the white dwarf cooling curve for three globular clusters
NGC 6397, M4 and 47 Tuc, around $0.53 M_{\odot}$, characteristic of old stellar
populations. However, we found different values for the progenitor mass, lower
for the metal poor cluster, NGC 6397, and larger for the younger and metal rich

horizons that are longer than in previous studies, where they are typically of
the order of a vortex shedding period or shorter. In the best configuration,
the drag is reduced by 19%, the vortex shedding is effectively suppressed, and
this low drag state is maintained with minimal cylinder rotation after
transients. Unlike open-loop control, the optimal control is shown to maintain
a specific phase relationship between the actuation and the shedding in order

we find that this mode has energies similar to the resonance observed by
Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) below the superconducting (SC) coherent peak
at $2\Delta$ in various SC cuprates compounds. We show that it is a very good

it may be observable via Raman, X -ray or Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy

flavour symmetry ${\mathbb A}_4\times {\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb

mixings with a specific texture. The model contains 3 generations of
$SU(2)_L$-doublet scalar fields, arranged as an ${\mathbb A}_4$-triplet, that
spontaneously break the electroweak symmetry, and a ""dark sector"" of ${\mathbb

candidate for dark matter.
  Concerning the ${\mathbb Z}_2$-even scalar fields, compared to the Standard
Model, we predict additional fields with masses at the electroweak scale. We
therefore investigate present phenomenological constraints from lepton flavour
violation experiments, obtaining a lower bound on the extra scalar masses of
140 GeV. Furthermore we consider the oblique parameters, Higgs boson decay
properties and possible flavour violating signals at the LHC.
  Concerning the ""dark sector"", we study bounds from dark matter search
experiments and identify the parameter space of the dark matter candidate that
is compatible with the observed relic density. We find two allowed mass ranges
for the dark matter within which the experimental constraints can be
accommodated: the low-mass range is from 47 GeV to 74 GeV and the high-mass

consumption in a building. This may result from its dimensions, orientation and
shadowing. In a moderate climate like the Portuguese, and considering an annual
thermal comfort assessment of a space, if windows are under-dimensioned or
over-shadowed, they can contribute to the increase of heating needs. However,
when over-dimensioned or under-shadowed, they contribute to the increase of
cooling requirements. Therefore, it is important to find the optimum design
that balances orientation, dimension and shadowing, contributing to minimize
both the heating and cooling needs. This study presents a parametric analysis
of a double glazing window in its orientation and dimension, located in the
Portuguese city of Coimbra. For each window orientation and dimension, the
optimum overhang depth is determined. The objective is to minimize degree-hours
of thermal discomfort. Results show that overhangs are mainly a corrective
mechanism to over-dimensioned openings, thus allowing that building

the mean returns conditioned on the sell signals. We find that TRB rules
outperform MA rules and short-term variable moving average (VMA) rules
outperform long-term VMA rules. By applying White's Reality Check test and
accounting for the data snooping effects, we find that the best trading rule
outperforms the buy-and-hold strategy when transaction costs are not taken into

eliminated completely. Our analysis suggests that simple trading rules like MA

effective cosmological terms induced by nonlinear off-diagonal interactions,
possible modifications of the gravitational action and graviton mass. The
cosmological metrics and related St\"" uckelberg fields are constructed in
explicit form up to nonholonomic frame transforms of the

include matter, graviton mass and other effective sources modelling nonlinear
gravitational and matter fields interactions with polarization of physical
constants and deformations of metrics, which may explain dark energy and dark
matter effects. However, we argue that it is not obligatory always to modify
gravity if we consider effective generalized Einstein equations with nontrivial
vacuum and/or non-minimal coupling with matter. Indeed, we state certain
conditions when such configurations mimic interesting solutions in general
relativity and modifications, for instance, when we can extract the general
Painlev\' e-Gullstrand and FLRW metrics. In a more general context, we
elaborate on a reconstruction procedure for off-diagonal cosmological solutions

organization of real-world networks, where nodes often belong to multiple
communities and form overlapping community structure in the network. Due to
non-triviality in finding the exact boundary of such overlapping communities,
this problem has become challenging, and therefore huge effort has been devoted
to detect overlapping communities from the network.
  In this paper, we present PVOC (Permanence based Vertex-replication algorithm
for Overlapping Community detection), a two-stage framework to detect
overlapping community structure. We build on a novel observation that
non-overlapping community structure detected by a standard disjoint community
detection algorithm from a network has high resemblance with its actual
overlapping community structure, except the overlapping part. Based on this
observation, we posit that there is perhaps no need of building yet another
overlapping community finding algorithm; but one can efficiently manipulate the
output of any existing disjoint community finding algorithm to obtain the
required overlapping structure. We propose a new post-processing technique that
by combining with any existing disjoint community detection algorithm, can
suitably process each vertex using a new vertex-based metric, called
permanence, and thereby finds out overlapping candidates with their community
memberships. Experimental results on both synthetic and large real-world
networks show that PVOC significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art
overlapping community detection algorithms in terms of high similarity of the
output with the ground-truth structure. Thus our framework not only finds
meaningful overlapping communities from the network, but also allows us to put
an end to the constant effort of building yet another overlapping community
detection algorithm.
