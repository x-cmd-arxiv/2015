$2$ with the category of double vector bundles endowed with a linear metric.
Split Poisson $N$-manifolds of degree $2$ are shown to be equivalent to
self-dual representations up to homotopy. As a consequence, the equivalence
above induces an equivalence between so called metric VB-algebroids and Poisson
$N$-manifolds of degree $2$.
  Then a new description of split Lie $2$-algebroids is given, as well as their
""duals"", the Dorfman $2$-representations. We show that Dorfman
$2$-representations are equivalent in a simple manner to Lagrangian splittings
of VB-Courant algebroids. This yields the equivalence of the categories of Lie
$2$-algebroids and of VB-Courant algebroids. We give several natural classes of
examples of split Lie $2$-algebroids and of the corresponding VB-Courant
algebroids.
  We then show that a split Poisson Lie $2$-algebroid is equivalent to the
""matched pair"" of a Dorfman $2$-representation with a self-dual representation
up to homotopy. We deduce a new proof of the equivalence of categories of
LA-Courant algebroids and Poisson Lie $2$-algebroids. We show that the core of
an LA-Courant algebroid inherits naturally the structure of a degenerate
Courant algebroid. This yields a new formula to retrieve in a direct manner the
Courant algebroid found by Roytenberg to correspond to a symplectic Lie
$2$-algebroid.
  Finally we study VB- and LA-Dirac structures in VB- and LA-Courant
algebroids. As an application, we extend Li-Bland's results on pseudo-Dirac

a black hole in a box together with its atmosphere is a pure state -- entangled
in just such a way that the reduced state of the black hole and of its
atmosphere are each separately approximately thermal. We also briefly recall
some recent work of the author which involves a reworking of the string-theory
understanding of black hole entropy consistent with this alternative
description of black hole equilibrium states and point out that this is free
from some unsatisfactory features of the usual string theory understanding. We
also recall the author's recent arguments based on this alternative description

due to losses in a communication line. Here we report an experiment on
distilling the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state of light, the workhorse of
continuous-variable entanglement, using the technique of noiseless
amplification. In contrast to previous implementations, the entanglement
enhancement factor achievable by our technique is not fundamentally limited and
permits recovering an EPR state with a macroscopic level of entanglement no
matter how low the initial entanglement or how high the loss may be. In
particular, we recover the original level of entanglement after one of the EPR
modes has passed through a channel with a loss factor of 20. The level of
entanglement in our distilled state is higher than that achievable by direct
transmission of any state through a similar loss channel. This is a key
bench-marking step towards the realization of a practical continuous-variable

reveals many more unpaired electrons than are observed by EPR, but is still
less than a single unpaired electron per atom on average. This suggests that a

rotations and old stellar populations, we find that the scatter of the

simulations. However, the tight Lx - T relation of genuine E galaxies extends
down into the Lx 1038 erg s-1 range, where simulations predict the gas to be in

bound hot halos even in this low luminosity range. At the high luminosity end,
the Lx - T correlation of core elliptical galaxies is similar to that found in
samples of cD galaxies and groups, but shifted down toward lower Lx. In
particular cDs have an order of magnitude higher Lx than core galaxies for the

range observed in giant Es; this conclusion is supported by the presence of
extended cold gas in several cDs. Instead, in the sub-sample of coreless ETGs,
Lx and T are not correlated, suggesting that both the energy input from star

shells around evolved stars and it is unclear to what extent they impact the

circumstellar dust models, using the radiative transfer code DUSTY Ivezic et
al. 1999, for asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and incorporated them into
the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis code. The circumstellar dust models
provide a good fit to individual AGB stars as well as the IR color-magnitude
diagrams of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. IR luminosity functions from
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are not well-fit by the 2008 Padova
isochrones when coupled to our circumstellar dust models, and so we adjusted
the lifetimes of AGB stars in the models to provide a match to the data. We
show, in agreement with previous work, that circumstellar dust from AGB stars
can make a significant contribution to the IR ($\gtrsim4\mu m$) emission from
galaxies that contain relatively little diffuse dust, including low-metallicity
and/or non-star forming galaxies. Our models provide a good fit to the mid-IR
spectra of early-type galaxies. Circumstellar dust around AGB stars appears to
have a small effect on the IR SEDs of metal-rich star-forming galaxies (i.e.,
when A$_{\rm V}$ $\gtrsim$~0.1). Stellar population models that include
circumstellar dust will be needed to accurately interpret data from the James

how predator evolution alters this and other ecological outcomes. These models
account for a trade-off between the predator's attack rates on two prey

their basins' of attraction using singular perturbation theory and a graphical
approach to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our results show that
eco-evolutionary feedbacks can mediate permanence at intermediate trade-offs in
the attack rates. However, at strong trade-offs, permanence is lost. Despite
this loss of permanence, there can be attractors supporting coexistence. These
attractors, however, may coincide with attractors at which the predator is
excluded. Our results highlight that evo-evolutionary feedbacks can alter
community structure by mediating coexistence or leading to trait-dependent
alternative stable states.

completeness in our synthetic CMDs. As expected, for simple simple stellar
populations dominated by old stars, the RGB provides a very accurate estimate
of the modular metallicity value for a population. An error in the age of a
system targeted for this type of study may produce metallicity errors of a few
tenths of a dex. The size of this metallicity error depends linearly on the age

representing standard network flow relations. The remaining freedom in the flow
distribution over the network is constrained by potentials so that the
difference of potentials at the head and the tail of an edge is expressed as a
nonlinear function of the edge flow. We consider networks with nodes divided
into three categories: sources that inject flows into the network for a certain
cost, terminals which buy the flow at a fixed price and ""internal"" customers
each withdrawing an uncertain amount of flow, which has a priority and thus it
is not priced. Our aim is to operate the network such that the profit, i.e.
amount of flow sold to terminals minus cost of injection, is maximized, while
maintaining the potentials within prescribed bounds. We also require that the
operating point is robust with respect to the uncertainty of customers'

of the withdrawals. This observation enables us to replace in the maximum
profit optimization infinitely many nodal constraints, each representing a
particular value of withdrawal uncertainty, by only two constraints
representing the cases where all nodes with uncertainty consume their minimum
and maximum amounts respectively. We illustrate this general result on example
of the natural gas transmission network. In this enabling example gas
withdrawals by consumers are assumed uncertain, the potentials are gas
pressures squared, the potential drop functions are bilinear in the flow and
its intensity with an added tunable factor representing compression.

estimates for the Ricci flow, and use them both to characterize solutions of
the Ricci flow and to provide a notion of weak solutions to the Ricci flow in
the nonsmooth setting. In this first paper, we prove various new estimates for
the Ricci flow, and show that they in fact characterize solutions of the Ricci
flow. Namely, given a family $(M,g_t)_{t\in I}$ of Riemannian manifolds, we
consider the path space $P\mathcal{M}$ of its space time $\mathcal{M}=M\times
I$. Our first characterization says that $(M,g_t)_{t\in I}$ evolves by Ricci
flow if and only if an infinite dimensional gradient estimate holds for all
functions on $P\mathcal{M}$. We prove additional characterizations in terms of
the $C^{1/2}$-regularity of martingales on path space, as well as
characterizations in terms of log-Sobolev and spectral gap inequalities for a
family of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type operators. Our estimates are infinite
dimensional generalizations of much more elementary estimates for the linear
heat equation on $(M,g_t)_{t\in I}$, which themselves generalize the
Bakry-Emery-Ledoux estimates for spaces with lower Ricci curvature bounds.
Based on our characterizations we can define a notion of weak solutions for the
Ricci flow. We will develop the structure theory of these weak solutions in
subsequent papers.

entanglement entropy. In particular, renormalization of the cosmological
constant and logarithmic divergence of the entanglement entropy are
interrelated in our setup. We confirm our findings by recovering known
universal contributions for a free field theory deformed by a mass operator as
well as obtain correct universal behaviour at the fixed points. Simple examples
of entanglement entropy flows are elaborated in $d=2,3,4$. In three dimensions
we find that while the renormalized entanglement entropy is stationary at the

universal `area law' for a conformally coupled scalar is different from the
known result in the literature, and argue that this difference survives in the
limit of flat space. Finally, we carry out the spectral decomposition of

mode in heavy nuclei. Microscopic density functional studies of fission have
previously concentrated on adiabatic approaches based on constrained static
calculations ignoring dynamical excitations of the fissioning nucleus, and the
daughter products.
  Purpose: To explore the ability of dynamic mean-field methods to describe
fast fission processes beyond the fission barrier, using the nuclide $^{240}$Pu
as an example.
  Methods: Time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations based on the Skyrme
interaction are used to calculate non-adiabatic fission paths, beginning from
static constrained Hartree-Fock calculations. The properties of the dynamic
states are interpreted in terms of the nature of their collective motion.
Fission product properties are compared to data.
  Results: Parent nuclei constrained to begin dynamic evolution with a
deformation less than the fission barrier exhibit giant-resonance-type
behaviour. Those beginning just beyond the barrier explore large amplitude
motion but do not fission, whereas those beginning beyond the two-fragment
pathway crossing fission to final states which differ according to the exact
initial deformation.
  Conclusions: Time-dependent Hartree-Fock is able to give a good qualitative
and quantitative description of fast fission, provided one begins from a
sufficiently deformed state.

stellar population and a series of young stellar components. We calculated
marginalized posterior probability distributions for various model parameters
and obtained 68% plausible intervals from them. The 68% plausible interval on
the SFRs is broad, owing to a wide range of models that are capable of fitting
the data, which also explains the wide dispersion in the star formation rates
available in the literature. The ranges of possible SFRs are robust and
highlight the strength in such a Bayesian analysis. The SFRs are correlated
with the X-ray mass deposition rates (the former are factors of 4 to 50 lower
than the latter), implying a picture where the cooling of the ICM is a
contributing factor to star formation in cool-core BCGs. We find that 9 out of

formation on intervals ranging from 20 Myr to 200 Myr. This time scale is

expansion along x is anisotropic, as expected for samples presenting
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In the creep regime, the sign and the value
of the domain wall velocity asymmetry changes along the wedge. We show that in
our samples the domain wall speed vs. Hx curves in the creep regime cannot be
explained simply in terms of the variation of the domain wall energy with Hx,
as suggested by previous works. For this reason the strength and the sign of
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) cannot be extracted from these

field-induced domain wall dynamics, measurements have been performed with high

the large values of DMI are coherent with those obtained from current-driven

multicellular organisms is governed by various signaling molecules, which are
called morphogens. It is known that spatial and temporal variations in
concentration profiles of signaling molecules, which are frequently referred as
morphogen gradients, lead to cell differentiation via activating specific genes
in a concentration-dependent manner. It is widely accepted that the
establishment of the morphogen gradients involves multiple biochemical
reactions and diffusion processes. One of the critical elements in the
formation of morphogen gradients is a degradation of signaling molecules. We
develop a new theoretical approach that provides a comprehensive description of
the degradation mechanisms. It is based on the idea that the degradation works
as an effective potential that drives the signaling molecules away from the
source region. Utilizing the method of first-passage processes, the dynamics of
the formation of morphogen gradients for various degradation mechanisms is
explicitly evaluated. It is found that the linear degradation leads to a
dynamic behavior specified by times to form the morphogen gradients that depend
linearly on the distance from the source. This is because the effective
potential due to degradation is quite strong. At the same time, the nonlinear
degradation mechanisms yield a quadratic scaling in the morphogen gradients
formation times since the effective potentials are much weaker.
Physical-chemical explanations of these phenomena are presented.

also considered by pumping the emitters with a short, high-intensity pulse. By
changing the duration or the intensity of the pump, the population of emitters

also studied the room-temperature firing behaviors of both types of spin

the current-driven type is degraded much more than the straintronic type if
both are optimized for maximum energy-efficiency. On the other hand, if both
are designed to have the same level of thermal degradation, then the
current-driven version will dissipate orders of magnitude more energy than the

its focus on teamwork. The objective of Scrum is to deliver working software

information systems have often a low priority. This requirements prioritization
issue results in the situations where the solution meets all the business

approach and the opportunity to automate penetration tests. Therefore the
security vulnerabilities can be discovered and solved more often which will
positively contribute to the overall information system protection against
potential hackers. In this research paper the authors propose how the agile
software development framework Scrum can be enriched by considering the
penetration tests and related security requirements during the software

amplitude with number of electrons per image we deduce that water molecules are
randomly displaced by mean squared distance of $\sim$ 1.1 \AA$^{2}$ for every

potential approach for achieving higher spectral efficiency. A possible
application is its employment in the next generation of cellular networks.
However, the performance of large-scale FD multiuser networks is an area mostly
unexplored. Most of the related work focuses on the performance analysis of
small-scale networks or on loop interference cancellation schemes. In this
paper, we derive the outage probability performance of large-scale FD cellular
networks in the context of two architectures: two-node and three-node. We show
how the performance is affected with respect to the model's parameters and
provide a comparison between the two architectures.

This problem has been extensively studied in both theory and practice, but all

graph, where the algorithm is given query access to the graph. The allowed
queries are degree queries, vertex-pair queries and neighbor queries.
  We show that for any given approximation parameter $0<\epsilon<1$, the
algorithm provides an estimate $\widehat{t}$ such that with high constant
probability, $(1-\epsilon)\cdot t< \widehat{t}<(1+\epsilon)\cdot t$, where $t$
is the number of triangles in the graph $G$. The expected query complexity of
the algorithm is $\!\left(\frac{n}{t^{1/3}} + \min\left\{m,
\frac{m^{3/2}}{t}\right\}\right)\cdot {\rm poly}(\log n, 1/\epsilon)$, where
$n$ is the number of vertices in the graph and $m$ is the number of edges, and
the expected running time is $\!\left(\frac{n}{t^{1/3}} +

that $\Omega\!\left(\frac{n}{t^{1/3}} + \min\left\{m,

the query complexity of this algorithm is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors

read data for many different organisms. The fact that NGS reads are generally
short makes it challenging to assemble the reads and reconstruct the original
genome sequence. For clustering genomes using such NGS data, word-count based
alignment-free sequence comparison is a promising approach, but for this
approach, the underlying expected word counts are essential.
  A plausible model for this underlying distribution of word counts is given
through modelling the DNA sequence as a Markov chain (MC). For single long
sequences, efficient statistics are available to estimate the order of MCs and
the transition probability matrix for the sequences. As NGS data do not provide
a single long sequence, inference methods on Markovian properties of sequences
based on single long sequences cannot be directly used for NGS short read data.
  Here we derive a normal approximation for such word counts. We also show that
the traditional Chi-square statistic has an approximate gamma distribution,
using the Lander-Waterman model for physical mapping. We propose several
methods to estimate the order of the MC based on NGS reads and evaluate them
using simulations. We illustrate the applications of our results by clustering
genomic sequences of several vertebrate and tree species based on NGS reads
using alignment-free sequence dissimilarity measures. We find that the
estimated order of the MC has a considerable effect on the clustering results,
and that the clustering results that use a MC of the estimated order give a
plausible clustering of the species.

Theorem (or FET), according to which, an analytic function of a Hermitian

arguments the diagonal elements of the Hermitian matrix. The theorem is
applicable in case of flavour changing amplitudes. At one-loop level this
procedure is particularly natural due to the observation that every loop
function in the Passarino-Veltman basis can be recursively expressed in terms
of divided differences. FET helps to algebraically translate an amplitude
written in mass eigenbasis into flavour mass insertions, without performing
diagrammatic calculations in flavour basis. As a non-trivial application of FET
up to a third order, we demonstrate its use in calculating strong bounds on the
real parts of flavour changing mass insertions in the up- squark sector of the

interacting photons and excitons (electron-hole pairs) in semiconductor
microcavities. They have emerged as a robust solid-state platform for
next-generation optoelectronic applications as well as fundamental studies of
quantum many-body physics. Importantly, exciton-polaritons are a profoundly
open (i.e., non-Hermitian) quantum system: it requires constant pumping of
energy and continuously decays releasing coherent radiation. Thus, the
exciton-polaritons always exist in a balanced potential landscape of gain and
loss. However, the inherent non-Hermitian nature of this potential has so far
been largely ignored in exciton-polariton physics. Here we demonstrate that
non-Hermiticity dramatically modifies the structure of modes and spectral
degeneracies in exciton-polariton systems, and, therefore, will affect their
quantum transport, localisation, and dynamical properties. Using a
spatially-structured optical pump, we create a chaotic exciton-polariton
billiard. Eigenmodes of this billiard exhibit multiple non-Hermitian spectral
degeneracies -- exceptional points. These are known to cause remarkable wave
phenomena, such as unidirectional transport, anomalous lasing/absorption, and
chiral modes. By varying parameters of the billiard, we observe crossing and
anti-crossing of energy levels and reveal the nontrivial topological modal
structure exclusive to non-Hermitian systems. We also observe the mode
switching and topological Berry phase for a parameter loop encircling the
exceptional point. Our findings pave the way for studies of non-Hermitian
quantum dynamics of exciton-polaritons, which can lead to novel functionalities
of polariton-based devices.

initial work of Freeman and Durden. This decomposition which assumes the target
to be reflection symmetric was later relaxed in the Yamaguchi et al.
decomposition with the addition of the helix parameter. Since then many
decomposition have been proposed where either the scattering model was modified
to fit the data or the coherency matrix representing the second order
statistics of the full polarimetric data is rotated to fit the scattering
model. In this paper we propose to modify the Yamaguchi four-component
decomposition (Y4O) scattering powers using the concept of statistical
information theory for matrices. In order to achieve this modification we
propose a method to estimate the polarization orientation angle (OA) from
full-polarimetric SAR images using the Hellinger distance. In this method, the
OA is estimated by maximizing the Hellinger distance between the un-rotated and
the rotated $T_{33}$ and the $T_{22}$ components of the coherency matrix
$\mathbf{[T]}$. Then, the powers of the Yamaguchi four-component model-based
decomposition (Y4O) are modified using the maximum relative stochastic distance
between the $T_{33}$ and the $T_{22}$ components of the coherency matrix at the
estimated OA. The results show that the overall double-bounce powers over
rotated urban areas have significantly improved with the reduction of volume
powers. The percentage of pixels with negative powers have also decreased from
the Y4O decomposition. The proposed method is both qualitatively and
quantitatively compared with the results obtained from the Y4O and the Y4R
decompositions for a Radarsat-2 C-band San-Francisco dataset and an UAVSAR
L-band Hayward dataset.

calculate the virial parameter for different regions, our new method takes
gravitational interactions between all the voxels in 3D PPV data cubes into
account, and generates maps of the importance of gravity. This map can be
combined with the original data cube to derive relations such as the
mass-radius relation. Our method is important for several reasons. First, it
offers the the ability to quantify the centrally condensed structures in the 3D
PPV data cubes, and enables us to compare them in an uniform framework. Second,
it allows us to understand the importance of gravity at different locations in
the data cube, and provides a global picture of gravity in clouds. Third, it
offers a robust approach to decomposing the data into different regions which
are gravitationally coherent. To demonstrate the application of our method we
identified regions from the Perseus and Ophiuchus molecular clouds, and
analyzed their properties. We found an increase in the importance of gravity
towards the centers of the individual molecular condensations. We also
quantified the properties of the regions in terms of mass-radius and
mass-velocity relations. Through evaluating the virial parameters based on the
G-virial, we found that all our regions are almost gravitationally bound.

involved in the decision process and elicit linguistic information that are
usually assessed in different linguistic scales with diverse granularity
because of decision makers' distinct knowledge and background. To keep maximum

multi-granular linguistic distribution assessments seems a suitable choice,
however to manage such multigranular linguistic distribution assessments, it is
necessary the development of a new linguistic computational approach. In this
paper it is proposed a novel computational model based on the use of extended
linguistic hierarchies, which not only can be used to operate with
multi-granular linguistic distribution assessments, but also can provide
interpretable linguistic results to decision makers. Based on this new
linguistic computational model, an approach to linguistic large-scale

are scattering states that spend some time in the zone of influence of the
scatterer, we associate them with the leaky modes of a waveguide, the latter
characterized by suffering attenuation in the direction of propagation but
increasing exponentially in the transverse directions. The resemblance is
complete since resonances (leaky modes) can be interpreted as bound states

application we calculate the leaky modes (resonances) associated with a
dielectric homogeneous slab (square well potential) and show that these modes

induce a triplet pairing state in time-reversal invariant 3D Dirac semi -
metals. Starting from the microscopic model of the isotropic Dirac semi-metal,
the Ginzburg-Landau equations for the vector order parameter is derived using
the Gor'kov technique. The collective modes including gapless Goldstone modes,
and gapped Higgs modes of various polarizations are identified. They are
somewhat analogous to the modes in the B phase of He3, although in the present
case quantitatively there is a pronouneced difference between longitudinal and
transverse components. The difference is caused by the vector nature of the
order parameter leading to two different coherence lengths or penetration
depths. The system is predicted to be highly dissipative due to the Goldstone
modes. The time dependent Ginzburg - Landau model in the presence of external
fields is used to investigate some optical and magnetic properties of such
superconductors. The AC conductivity of a clean sample depends on the
orientation of the order parameter. It is demonstrated that the difference
between the penetration depths results in rotation of the polarization vector
of microwave passing a slab made of this material. The upper critical magnetic
field H_{c2} was found. It turns out that at fields close to H_{c2} the order
parameter orients itself perpendicular to the field direction. In certain range
of parameters the triplet superconducting phase persists at arbitrarily high
magnetic field like in some p wave superconductors.

magnetoresistance (TMR) is described for magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) and
studied on an example of the MTJ with hcp Co electrodes and hexagonal BN (h-BN)
spacer. Our calculations based on local density approximation of density
functional theory (LDA-DFT) for Co(0001)/h-BN/Co(0001) MTJ predict high TMR in
this device due to Brillouin zone filtering mechanism. Owning to the specific
complex band structure of the h-BN the spin-dependent tunneling conductance of
the system is ultra-sensitive to small variations of the Fermi energy position
inside the BN band gap. Doping of the BN and, consequentially, changing the
Fermi energy position could lead to variation of the TMR by several orders of
magnitude. We show also that taking into account correlation effects on beyond
DFT level is required to accurately describe position of the Fermi level and
thus transport propertied of the system. Our study suggests that new MTJ based
on hcp Co-Pt or Co-Pd disordered alloy electrodes and p-doped hexagonal BN
spacer is a promising candidate for the spin-transfer torque magnetoresistive
random-access memory (STT-MRAM).

We
minimally extend the conventional single-field inflation model in general
relativity (GR) to a theory with non-vanishing graviton mass in the very early
universe. The modification primarily affects the tensor perturbation, while the
scalar and vector perturbations are the same as the ones in GR with a single
scalar field at least at the level of linear perturbation theory. During the
reheating stage, the graviton mass oscillates coherently and leads to resonant
amplification of the primordial tensor perturbation. After reheating the
graviton mass vanishes and we recover GR.

analogue of the electronic quantum Hall effect. We investigate the response of
both hexagonal and square gyroscopic lattices and observe bulk Chern number of
1 and 2, indicating that these structures support single and multi-mode edge
elastic waves immune to back-scattering. These robust one-way phononic
waveguides could potentially lead to the design of a novel class of surface

acoustic imaging.
