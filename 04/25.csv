However, while identifying cyclically expressed genes from time series

we explicitly leverage the oscillatory nature of the transcriptional signals

projecting the signal onto a set of oscillatory basis functions using a
Discrete Fourier Transform. We build a Bayesian Hierarchical model within a

prior knowledge about the network structure. Experiments on real and simulated

over a finite planning horizon $T$ with non-stationary demands.
  (a) Submodular Joint Replenishment Problem: This involves multiple item types
and a single retailer who faces demands. In each time step, any subset of
item-types can be ordered incurring a joint ordering cost which is submodular.
Moreover, items can be held in inventory while incurring a holding cost. The
objective is find a sequence of orders that satisfies all demands and minimizes
the total ordering and holding costs.
  (b) Inventory Routing Problem: This involves a single depot that stocks
items, and multiple retailer locations facing demands. In each time step, any
subset of locations can be visited using a vehicle originating from the depot.
There is also cost incurred for holding items at any retailer. The objective
here is to satisfy all demands while minimizing the sum of routing and holding
costs.
  We present a unified approach that yields $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log
T}{\log\log T}\right)$-factor approximation algorithms for both problems when
the holding costs are polynomial functions. A special case is the classic
linear holding cost model, wherein this is the first sub-logarithmic

images from optical survey telescopes. We use a photon Monte Carlo approach to
construct images by sampling photons from models of astronomical source
populations, and then simulating those photons through the system as they
interact with the atmosphere, telescope, and camera. We demonstrate that all
physical effects for optical light that determine the shapes, locations, and
brightnesses of individual stars and galaxies can be accurately represented in
this formalism. By using large scale grid computing, modern processors, and an
efficient implementation that can produce 400,000 photons/second, we
demonstrate that even very large optical surveys can be now be simulated. We
demonstrate that we are able to: 1) construct kilometer scale phase screens
necessary for wide-field telescopes, 2) reproduce atmospheric
point-spread-function moments using a fast novel hybrid geometric/Fourier
technique for non-diffraction limited telescopes, 3) accurately reproduce the
expected spot diagrams for complex aspheric optical designs, and 4) recover
system effective area predicted from analytic photometry integrals. This new
code, the photon simulator (PhoSim), is publicly available. We have implemented
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) design, and it can be extended to
other telescopes. We expect that because of the comprehensive physics
implemented in PhoSim, it will be used by the community to plan future
observations, interpret detailed existing observations, and quantify
systematics related to various astronomical measurements. Future development
and validation by comparisons with real data will continue to improve the
fidelity and usability of the code.

search. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the objectness prior
over the deep CNN features of image regions for obtaining an invariant image
representation. The proposed approach represents the image as a vector of
pooled CNN features describing the underlying objects. This representation
provides robustness to spatial layout of the objects in the scene and achieves
invariance to general geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation
and scaling. The proposed approach also leads to a compact representation of
the scene, making each image occupy a smaller memory footprint. Experiments
show that the proposed representation achieves state of the art retrieval
results on a set of challenging benchmark image datasets, while maintaining a
compact representation.

communication systems are often compensated by reverting the nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation, which describes the evolution of the signal in the

digital backpropagation algorithms are based on split-step Fourier methods in
which the signal has to be discretized in time and space. The need to
discretize in both time and space however makes the real-time implementation of
digital backpropagation a challenging problem. In this paper, a new fast
algorithm for digital backpropagation based on nonlinear Fourier transforms is
presented. Aiming at a proof of concept, the main emphasis will be put on
fibers with normal dispersion in order to avoid the issue of solitonic
components in the signal. However, it is demonstrated that the algorithm also
works for anomalous dispersion if the signal power is low enough. Since the
spatial evolution of a signal governed by the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation
can be reverted analytically in the nonlinear Fourier domain through simple
phase-shifts, there is no need to discretize the spatial domain. The proposed
algorithm requires only $\mathcal{O}(D\log^{2}D)$ floating point operations to
backpropagate a signal given by $D$ samples, independently of the fiber's
length, and is therefore highly promising for real-time implementations. The
merits of this new approach are illustrated through numerical simulations.

inputs are distributed among $k$ processors, each of which is located at one
vertex of a network/graph called a terminal. Every other node of the network
also has a processor, with no input. The communication is point-to-point and
the cost is the total number of bits exchanged by the protocol, in the worst
case, on all edges.
  Chattopadhyay, Radhakrishnan and Rudra (FOCS'14) recently initiated a study
of the effect of topology of the network on the total communication cost using
tools from $L_1$ embeddings. Their techniques provided tight bounds for simple
functions like Element-Distinctness (ED), which depend on the 1-median of the
graph. This work addresses two other kinds of natural functions. We show that
for a large class of natural functions like Set-Disjointness the communication
cost is essentially $n$ times the cost of the optimal Steiner tree connecting
the terminals. Further, we show for natural composed functions like $\text{ED}
\circ \text{XOR}$ and $\text{XOR} \circ \text{ED}$, the naive protocols
suggested by their definition is optimal for general networks. Interestingly,
the bounds for these functions depend on more involved topological parameters
that are a combination of Steiner tree and 1-median costs.
  To obtain our results, we use some new tools in addition to ones used in
Chattopadhyay et. al. These include (i) viewing the communication constraints
via a linear program; (ii) using tools from the theory of tree embeddings to
prove topology sensitive direct sum results that handle the case of composed
functions and (iii) representing the communication constraints of certain
problems as a family of collection of multiway cuts, where each multiway cut
simulates the hardness of computing the function on the star topology.

However, we do not suggest that G is actually varying by this much, this
quickly, but instead that something in the measurement process varies. Of other
recently reported results, to the best of our knowledge, the only measurement
with the same period and phase is the Length of Day (LOD - defined as a
frequency measurement such that a positive increase in LOD values means slower
Earth rotation rates and therefore longer days). The aforementioned period is
also about half of a solar activity cycle, but the correlation is far less
convincing. The 5.9 year periodic signal in LOD has previously been interpreted
as due to fluid core motions and inner-core coupling. We report the G/LOD
correlation, whose statistical significance is 0.99764 assuming no difference
in phase, without claiming to have any satisfactory explanation for it. Least
unlikely, perhaps, are currents in the Earth's fluid core that change both its
moment of inertia (affecting LOD) and the circumstances in which the
Earth-based experiments measure G. In this case, there might be correlations

requires the complete absence of internal motions. A more realistic
configuration, however, is an irrotational state that establishes, in the

recompute the gravitomagnetic Love numbers for this irrotational state, and
show that they are dramatically different from those associated with the strict

spectrum of a triangular lattice antiferromagnet in its ordered coplanar 3-

self$-$energy corrections to the spin wave spectrum, magnon decay rate,
bimagnon interactions within the ladder approximation Bethe-Salpeter scheme,
and the effect of three-magnon contributions up to 1/S- order we find that the
RIXS spectra is non-trivially affected. For a purely isotropic triangular
lattice model, the peak splitting mechanism and the appearance of a multipeak
RIXS structure is primarily dictated by the damping of magnon modes. At a
scattering wavevector corresponding to the zone center \Gamma point and at the
roton point q=M, where the magnon decay rate is zero, a stable single peak
forms. At the $\Gamma$ point, the contribution is purely trimagnon at the 1/S
level and occurs approximately at the trimagnon energy of 6JS. The roton peak
occurs at a lower energy of 4JS. The K-edge single peak RIXS spectra at the
roton momentum can be utilized as an experimental signature to detect the
presence of roton excitations. A unique feature of the triangular lattice
K-edge RIXS spectra is the nonvanishing RIXS intensity at both the zone center
$\Gamma$ point and the antiferromagnetic wavevector K point. This result is in
sharp contrast to the vanishing K-edge RIXS intensity of the collinear magnetic
phases on the square lattice. We find that including XXZ anisotropy leads to
additional peak splitting, including at the roton scattering wavevector where
the single peak destabilizes towards a two-peak structure. The observed
splitting is consistent with our earlier theoretical prediction of the effects
of spatial anisotropy on the RIXS spectra of a frustrated quantum magnet [Luo,
Datta, and Yao, Phys. Rev. B 89, 165103 (2014)].

heliospheric current sheet (HCS) during periods when other sources are absent.
These resemble solar energetic particle (SEP) events, but the events are weaker
and apparently local. Conventional explanations based on either shock
acceleration of charged particles or particle acceleration due to magnetic
reconnection at interplanetary current sheets are not persuasive. We suggest
instead that recurrent magnetic reconnection occurs at the HCS and smaller
current sheets in the solar wind (Zharkova & Khabarova 2012), of which a
consequence is particle energization by the dynamically evolving secondary
current sheets and magnetic islands (Zank et al. 2014; Drake et al. 2006a). The
effectiveness of the trapping and acceleration process associated with magnetic
islands depends in part on the topology of the HCS. We show that the HCS
possesses ripples superimposed on the large-scale flat or wavy structure. We
conjecture that the ripples can efficiently confine plasma and provide
tokamak-like conditions that are favorable for the appearance of small-scale
magnetic islands that merge and/or contract. Particles trapped in the vicinity
of merging islands and experiencing multiple small-scale reconnection events
are accelerated by the induced electric field, and experience first-order Fermi
acceleration in contracting magnetic islands (Zank et al. 2014). We present
multi-spacecraft observations of magnetic island merging and particle
energization in the absence of other sources, providing support for theory and
simulations that show particle energization by reconnection related processes
of magnetic island merging and contraction.

direct computations for the determinant lines of Fredholm operators over

allows us to endow the uncompactified moduli spaces of real maps from symmetric
surfaces of all topological types with natural orientations and to verify that
they extend across the codimension-one boundaries of these spaces, thus
implementing a far-reaching proposal from C.-C. Liu's thesis for a fully

provide the relevant equivariant localization data for projective spaces, and
obtain vanishing results in the spirit of Walcher's predictions.

particle hydrodynamics, gas cooling, star formation (including molecular
hydrogen), black hole growth and models for stellar and AGN feedback processes.
The star formation rate density in the simulation is a good match to current
observational data at $z\sim 8-10$. We find good agreement between observations
and the predicted galaxy luminosity function in the currently observable range
$-18\le M_{\mathrm UV} \le -22.5$ with some dust extinction required to match
the abundance of brighter objects. BlueTides implements a patchy reionization
model that produces a fluctuating UV background. BlueTides predicts number
counts for galaxies fainter than current observational limits which are
consistent with extrapolating the faint end slope of the luminosity function
with a power law index $\alpha\sim -1.8$ at $z\sim 8$ and redshift dependence
of $\alpha\sim (1+z)^{-0.4}$. The AGN population has a luminosity function well
fit by a power law with a slope $\alpha\sim -2.4$ that compares favourably with
the deepest CANDELS-Goods fields. We investigate how these luminosity functions
affect the progress of reionization, and find that a high Lyman-$\alpha$ escape
fraction ($f_\mathrm{esc} \sim 0.5$) is required if galaxies dominate the
ionising photon budget during reionization. Smaller galaxy escape fractions
imply a large contribution from faint AGN (down to $M_\mathrm{UV}=-12$) which
results in a rapid reionization, disfavoured by current observations.

provides a basis for understanding high-$z$ galaxies - including those that may
be unobservable even with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) - in the
context of familiar, well-studied objects in the very low-$z$ Universe. We find
that, at the epoch of reionization, all Local Group dwarfs were less luminous
than the faintest galaxies detectable in deep HST observations of blank fields.
We predict that JWST will observe $z \sim 7$ progenitors of galaxies similar to
the Large Magellanic Cloud today; however, the HST Frontier Fields initiative
may already be observing such galaxies, highlighting the power of gravitational
lensing. Consensus reionization models require an extrapolation of the observed
blank-field luminosity function at $z \approx 7$ by at least two orders of
magnitude in order to maintain reionization. This scenario requires the
progenitors of the Fornax and Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxies to be
contributors to the ionizing background at $z \sim 7$. Combined with numerical
simulations, our results argue for a break in the UV luminosity function from a
faint-end slope of $\alpha \sim -2$ at $M_{\rm UV} < -13$ to $\alpha \sim -1.2$

Most of them steadily spin
down and display a highly repetitive pulse shape. But some pulsars experience
timing irregularities such as nulling, intermittency, mode changing and timing
noise. As changes in the pulse shape are often correlated with timing
irregularities, precession is a possible cause of these phenomena. Whereas
pulsar magnetospheres are filled with plasma, most pulsar precession studies
were carried out within the vacuum approximation and neglected the effects of
magnetospheric currents and charges. Recent numerical simulations of
plasma-filled pulsar magnetospheres provide us with a detailed quantitative
description of magnetospheric torques exerted on the pulsar surface. In this
paper, we present the study of neutron star evolution using these new torque
expressions. We show that they lead to (1) much slower long-term evolution of
pulsar parameters and (2) much less extreme solutions for these parameters than
the vacuum magnetosphere models. To facilitate the interpretation of observed
pulsar timing residuals, we derive an analytic model that (1) describes the
time evolution of non-spherical pulsars and (2) translates the observed pulsar
timing residuals into the geometrical parameters of the pulsar. We apply this
model to two pulsars with very different temporal behaviours. For the pulsar
B1828-11, we demonstrate that the timing residual curves allow two pulsar
geometries: one with stellar deformation pointing along the magnetic axis and
one along the rotational axis. For the Crab pulsar, we use the model show that
the recent observation of its magnetic and rotational axes moving away from

sub-millimeter sources coincident with the core of this cluster: $\sim 3-4
\times$ higher than expected in a blank field. We use the likely radio and
mid-infrared counterparts to show that the bulk of these sub-millimeter sources
have spectroscopic or photometric redshifts which place them in the cluster and
that their multi-wavelength properties are consistent with this association.
The average far-infrared luminosities of these galaxies are $(1.0\pm0.1) \times
10^{12} L_{\odot}$, placing them on the U/LIRG boundary. Using the total star
formation occurring in the obscured U/LIRG population within the cluster we
show that the resulting mass-normalized star-formation rate for this system
supports previous claims of a rapid increase in star-formation activity in
cluster cores out to $z\sim1.5$, which must be associated with the on-going
formation of the early-type galaxies which reside in massive clusters today.

Our work is based on the simple observation that the set of configurations for

the exact placement of the robot. This allows to eliminate the need to perform
costly self-collision checks online when solving motion-planning problems,
assuming some offline preprocessing. In particular, given a specific robot type
our algorithm precomputes a tiling roadmap, which efficiently and implicitly
encodes the self-collision free (sub-)space over the entire configuration
space, where the latter can be infinite for that matter. To answer any query,
in any given scenario, we traverse the tiling roadmap while only testing for
collisions with obstacles. Our algorithm suggests more flexibility than the
prevailing paradigm in which a precomputed roadmap depends both on the robot

effectiveness of this approach on open and closed-chain multi-link robots,

arrangements of newly emerged and PEAR magnetic flux, indicate the existence of
""topological"" free magnetic energy in the global coronal field that is
independent of any ""internal"" free magnetic energy due to coronal electric
currents flowing within the newly emerged and PEAR flux systems. We then
examine the interaction energy in two well-studied cases of flux emergence, but
find that the predicted energetic perturbation is relatively small compared to
energies released in large solar flares. Next, we present an observational
study on the influence of the emergence of new ARs on flare statistics in
PEARs, using NOAA's Solar Region Summary and GOES flare databases. As part of
an effort to precisely determine the emergence time of ARs in a large event
sample, we find that emergence in about half of these regions exhibits a
two-stage behavior, with an initial gradual phase followed by a more rapid
phase. Regarding flaring, we find that the emergence of new ARs is associated
with a significant increase in the occurrence rate of X- and M-class flares in
PEARs. This effect tends to be more significant when PEARs and new emerging ARs
are closer. Given the relative weakness of the interaction energy, this effect
suggests that perturbations in the large-scale magnetic field, such as topology
changes invoked in the ""breakout"" model of coronal mass ejections, might play a
significant role in the occurrence of some flares.

computing regularization paths, or solving the optimization problems over the
full range of regularization parameters to obtain a sequence of sparse models.
In this chapter, we aim to quickly approximate the sequence of sparse models
associated with regularization paths for the purposes of statistical model

method, the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We begin by
proposing an ADMM algorithm that uses warm-starts to quickly compute the
regularization path. Then, by employing approximations along this warm-starting
ADMM algorithm, we propose a novel concept that we term the ADMM Algorithmic
Regularization Path. Our method can quickly outline the sequence of sparse
models associated with the regularization path in computational time that is
often less than that of using the ADMM algorithm to solve the problem at a
single regularization parameter. We demonstrate the applicability and
substantial computational savings of our approach through three popular
examples, sparse linear regression, reduced-rank multi-task learning, and
convex clustering.

The ambiguity of introducing a parametrization associated with the dipole

sections, in agreement with the data. The same formalism allows us to calculate

resolution (~4""), the source was known to have two inner radio lobes spanning
31 kpc and a diffuse, low-brightness extension running parallel to them, offset
by about 11 kpc (in projection).
  At 62 MHz, we detect the radio emission of this structure extending out to

  The AGN is hosted by one of the galaxies located in the cluster core of Abell

from that episode of activity out to greater distances from the core than ever
before.

mechanism for starting (or restarting) the radio-loud activity can provide
important constraints to quantify the impact of AGN feedback on galaxy
evolution. The study of these mechanisms at low frequencies using morphological

intrinsic self-oscillatory behavior of an insectile wing model, consisting of
two rigid wings connected at their base by an elastic torsional spring. We
study the wings behavior as a function of the total energy and spring
stiffness. Three types of behavior are identified: end-over-end rotation,
chaotic motion, and periodic flapping. Interestingly, the region of periodic
flapping decreases as energy increases but is favored as stiffness increases.
These findings are consistent with the fact that insect wings and flight

critical step in which a condensed object emerges from a prestellar core. This
step lasts about one thousand years, a very short time compared with the
lifetime of prestellar cores, and therefore is hard to detect unambiguously.
  We present IRAM Plateau de Bure observations of the Barnard 1b dense
molecular core, combining detections of H2CO and CH3OH spectral lines and dust
continuum at 2.3"" resolution (~ 500 AU). The two compact cores B1b-N and B1b-S
are detected in the dust continuum at 2mm, with fluxes that agree with their
spectral energy distribution. Molecular outflows associated with both cores are
detected. They are inclined relative to the direction of the magnetic field, in
agreement with predictions of collapse in turbulent and magnetized gas with a
ratio of mass to magnetic flux somewhat higher than the critical value, \mu ~ 2
- 7. The outflow associated with B1b-S presents sharp spatial structures, with
ejection velocities of up to ~ 7 kms from the mean velocity. Its dynamical age
is estimated to be ~2000 yrs. The B1b-N outflow is smaller and slower, with a
short dynamical age of ~1000 yrs. The B1b-N outflow mass, mass-loss rate, and
mechanical luminosity agree well with theoretical predictions of FHSC. These
observations confirm the early evolutionary stage of B1b-N and the slightly
more evolved stage of B1b-S.

processor powered by single battery (SPSB) can be viewed as a generic case for
the modeling effort. This paper introduces a dynamic model for multiple
aperiodic tasks on a SPSB system under a scheduling algorithm that resembles
the rate monotonic scheduling (RMS) within finite time windows. The model
contains two major modules. The first module is an online battery capacity
model based on the Rakhmatov-Vrudhula-Wallach (RVW) model. This module provides
predictions of remaining battery capacity based on the knowledge of the battery
discharging current. The second module is a dynamical scheduling model that can
predict the scheduled behavior of tasks within any finite time window, without
the need to store all past information about each task before the starting time
of the finite time window. The module provides a complete analytical
description of the relationship among tasks and it delineates all possible
modes of the processor utilization as square-wave functions of time. The two
modules i.e. the scheduling model and the battery model are integrated to
obtain a hybrid scheduling model that describes the dynamic behaviors of the
SPSB system. Our effort may have demonstrated that through dynamic modeling,
different components of CPS may be integrated under a unified theoretical
framework centered around hybrid systems theory.

for a beneficial co-dopant ion among the alkaline earth metal family and by
optimizing its concentration and that of Tl+ and Eu2+ ions. The composition
with the best performance was identified as 0.1% mol Tl+, 0.1% mol Eu2+ and
0.2% mol Ca2+. This formulation shows enhancement of energy resolution and

2013df showed a dramatic change in its spectral features at ~1 year after the
explosion. Early on it showed typical characteristics shared by SNe IIb/Ib/Ic
dominated by metal emission lines, while later on it was dominated by broad and
flat-topped Halpha and He I emissions. The late-time spectra are strikingly
similar to SN IIb 1993J, which is the only previous example clearly showing the
same transition. This late-time evolution is fully explained by a change in the
energy input from the $^{56}$Co decay to the interaction between the SN ejecta
and dense circumstellar matter (CSM). The mass loss rate is derived to be ~(5.4
+- 3.2) x 10^{-5} Msun/yr (for the wind velocity of ~20 km/s), similar to SN
1993J but larger than SN IIb 2011dh by an order of magnitude. The striking
similarity between SNe 2013df and 1993J in the (candidate) progenitors and the
CSM environments, and the contrast in these natures to SN 2011dh, infer that
there is a link between the natures of the progenitor and the mass loss: SNe
IIb with a more extended progenitor have experienced a much stronger mass loss
in the final centuries toward the explosion. It might indicate that SNe IIb
from a more extended progenitor are the explosions during a strong binary
interaction phase, while those from a less extended progenitor have a delay
between the strong binary interaction and the explosion.

Powerful Bayesian atmospheric retrieval tools have recently been applied to
both exoplanet and brown dwarf spectra to tease out the thermal structures and
molecular abundances to understand those processes. In this manuscript we
develop a significantly upgraded retrieval method and apply it to the SpeX
spectral library data of two benchmark late T-dwarfs, Gl570D and HD3651B, to
establish the validity of our upgraded forward model parameterization and
Bayesian estimator. Our retrieved metallicities, gravities, and effective
temperature are consistent with the metallicity and presumed ages of the
systems. We add the carbon-to-oxygen ratio as a new dimension to benchmark
systems and find good agreement between carbon-to-oxygens ratio derived in the
brown dwarfs and the host stars. Furthermore, we have for the first time
unambiguously determined the presence of ammonia in the low-resolution spectra
of these two late T-dwarfs. We also show that the retrieved results are not
significantly impacted by the possible presence of clouds, though some
quantities are significantly impacted by uncertainties in photometry. This
investigation represents a watershed study in establishing the utility of
atmospheric retrieval approaches on brown dwarf spectra.

placing the slit over the morphological major and minor axes and two
intermediate position angles. However, due to poor weather conditions during

velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disk, sigma_z,0, of 13.5+/-8 km/s for
DDO 46 and <sigma_z,0> of 10.7+/-2.9 km/s for DDO 168. We then derived the
maximum rotation speed in both galaxies using the LITTLE THINGS HI data. We
separated bulk motions from non-circular motions using a double Gaussian
decomposition technique and applied a tilted-ring model to the bulk velocity
field. We corrected the observed HI rotation speeds for asymmetric drift and
found a maximum velocity, Vmax, of 77.4 +/- 3.7 and 67.4 +/- 4.0 km/s for DDO

Vmax/sigma_z,0, of 5.7 +/- 0.6 for DDO 46 and 6.3 +/- 0.3 for DDO 168.

complex sequential information since it utilizes special gating schemes for

an ideal choice to learn the complex dynamics of various actions.
Unfortunately, the conventional LSTMs do not consider the impact of
spatio-temporal dynamics corresponding to the given salient motion patterns,

address this problem, we propose a differential gating scheme for the LSTM
neural network, which emphasizes on the change in information gain caused by
the salient motions between the successive frames. This change in information
gain is quantified by Derivative of States (DoS), and thus the proposed LSTM

$\Pi_{\rm 1.4\,GHz}$ between radiative-mode AGN (i.e. high-excitation radio

$\Pi_{\rm 1.4\,GHz} \lesssim 15\%$. A difference in $\Pi_{\rm 1.4\,GHz}$ is
also seen when the sample is divided at 0.5% of the total Eddington-scaled
accretion rate, where the weakly accreting sources can attain higher values of
$\Pi_{\rm 1.4\,GHz}$. We do not find any clear evidence that this is driven by
intrinsic magnetic field differences of the different radio morphological
classes. Instead, we attribute the differences in $\Pi_{\rm 1.4\,GHz}$ to the
local environments of the radio sources, in terms of both the ambient gas
density and the magnetoionic properties of this gas. Thus, not only are
different large-scale gaseous environments potentially responsible for the
different accretion states of HERGs and LERGs, we argue that the large-scale
magnetised environments may also be important for the formation of powerful AGN

$l$-section of that PMCS. We generalize the equilibrium semantics for an MCS to
the (maximal) $l_{\leq}$-equilibrium which represents belief states at least
acceptable for the $l$-section of an PMCS. We also investigate inconsistency

directed acyclic graphs, which gives larger weight to sparse graphs. This
distribution is intended for structured Bayesian networks, where the structure
is given by an ordered block model. That is, the nodes of the graph are objects
which fall into categories (or blocks); the blocks have a natural ordering. The
presence of a relationship between two objects is denoted by an arrow, from the
object of lower category to the object of higher category. The models
considered here were introduced in Kemp et al. (2004) for relational data and
extended to multivariate data in Mansinghka et al. (2006). The prior over graph
structures presented here has an explicit formula. The number of nodes in each
layer of the graph follow a Hoppe Ewens urn model.
  We consider the situation where the nodes of the graph represent random
variables, whose joint probability distribution factorises along the DAG. We
describe Monte Carlo schemes for finding the optimal aposteriori structure
given a data matrix and compare the performance with Mansinghka et al. (2006)

higher gamma-ray energies the correlation weakens and even becomes negative for

to be more sensitive to the considered gamma-ray energy band, than to the

doping process can be described by the Fick's second law equation with a single
effective diffusion coefficient which takes into account two impurity flows

computer vision since shape is perhaps the most distinguishable characteristic
of an object. The problem is difficult due to many factors such as intra-class

extraneous contour portions due to errors in shape extraction. While small
local deformations has been handled in the literature by allowing some leeway
in the matching of individual contour points via methods such as Chamfer
distance and Hausdorff distance, handling more severe deformations and
articulations has been done by applying local geometric corrections such as
similarity or affine. However, determining which portions of the shape should
be used for the geometric corrections is very hard, although some methods have
been tried. In this paper, we address this problem by an efficient search for
the group of contour segments to be clustered together for a geometric
correction using Dynamic Programming by essentially searching for the
segmentations of two shapes that lead to the best matching between them. At the
same time, we allow portions of the contours to remain unmatched to handle
missing and extraneous contour portions. Experiments indicate that our method
outperforms other algorithms, especially when the shapes to be matched are more

dynamics on multilayer networks are important questions that are usually
discussed in separate communities. Here, we combine these two topics by
investigating the influence of the topology of the migration network on the
stability of a four-species foodweb module on six patches. The parameters are
chosen such that the dynamics on an isolated patch have a periodic attractor
with all four species present as well as an attractor where the prey that is
preferred by the top predator dies out. The stability measure used here is
robustness, which is the average proportion of surviving species in the system,
and which shows a complex dependence on the migration rate. We use principal
component analysis to quantify the migration network structure in terms of the
most relevant network measures, and we evaluate correlations between these
measures and characteristics of the robustness curves. Our most important
findings are that higher connectivity of the migration network leads to a
larger maximum robustness, that a broad distribution of connectivities favors
extinction of the preferred prey at intermediate migration rates, and that
migration topologies with a larger betweenness centrality are more prone to
extinction of the preferred prey at the onset of synchronization. Our study
thus demonstrates a strong correlation between dynamical robustness and spatial
topology and can serve as an example for similar studies in other types of
multilayer networks.

deconfinement transition is then signaled by a strong rise of $\Sigma_1$ as a
function of temperature. However, a similar behaviour is also seen in the NJL

Switching between ""confining"" and ""non-confining"" models and parametrizations
we find no qualitative difference in the behaviour of $\Sigma_1$, namely, it
always rises in the region of the chiral phase transition. We conclude that
without having established a relation to the center symmetry in a given model,
$\Sigma_1$ should not blindly be regarded as an order parameter of confinement.

the harmonics in its Fourier series. We prove that the density of a certain
packing of Reuleaux curved triangles in the plane is $$\frac{2 (\pi -
\sqrt{3})}{\sqrt{15} + \sqrt{7} - 2 \sqrt{3}} \simeq 0.92288$$ which exceeds
the maximum density for circles ($\simeq 0.9060$), and conjecture this is the
maximum for any curve of constant width. For surfaces of constant width we show
that $ \rho_0(P)+ \rho_1(Q)=w$ where the $\rho_i$ are the principal curvatures,
$P$ and $Q$ are opposite points, and $w>0$ is the width. Moreover, an ovoid is
a surface of constant width $w>0$ if and only if $\rho_{{\rm
mean}}(P)+\rho_{{\rm mean}}(Q) = w$ where $\rho_{{\rm mean}}(P)$ is the average
radius of curvature at point $P$. Finally, we provide a Fourier series-based
construction that produces arbitrarily many new surfaces of constant width.

databases---need to run workloads on behalf of multiple tenants simultaneously.
The abundant disk-based storage in these systems is usually complemented by a
smaller, but much faster, {\em cache}. Cache is a precious resource: Tenants
who get to use cache can see two orders of magnitude performance improvement.
Cache is also a limited and hence shared resource: Unlike a resource like a CPU
core which can be used by only one tenant at a time, a cached data item can be
accessed by multiple tenants at the same time. Cache, therefore, has to be
shared by a multi-tenancy-aware policy across tenants, each having a unique set
of priorities and workload characteristics.
  In this paper, we develop cache allocation strategies that speed up the
overall workload while being {\em fair} to each tenant. We build a novel
fairness model targeted at the shared resource setting that incorporates not
only the more standard concepts of Pareto-efficiency and sharing incentive, but
also define envy freeness via the notion of {\em core} from cooperative game
theory. Our cache management platform, ROBUS, uses randomization over small
time batches, and we develop a proportionally fair allocation mechanism that
satisfies the core property in expectation. We show that this algorithm and
related fair algorithms can be approximated to arbitrary precision in
polynomial time. We evaluate these algorithms on a ROBUS prototype implemented
on Spark with RDD store used as cache. Our evaluation on a synthetically
generated industry-standard workload shows that our algorithms provide a
speedup close to performance optimal algorithms while guaranteeing fairness
across tenants.

based on the gauge group $SU(3)_C\times SU(3)_L\times SU(3)_R$. It naturally
explains parity violation as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the
observed fermion masses and mixings can be reproduced using only a few
parameters. We study the low-energy phenomenology of the trinification model in
order to compare its predictions to experiment. To this end, we construct a
low-energy effective field theory, thereby reducing the number of particles and
free parameters that need to be studied. We constrain the model parameters
using limits from new-particle searches as well as precision measurements. The
scalar sector of the model allows for various phenomenological scenarios, such
as the presence of a light fermiophobic scalar in addition to a
Standard-Model-like Higgs, or a degenerate (twin) Higgs state at 126 GeV. We
show how a measurement of the Higgs couplings can be used to distinguish such
scenarios from the Standard Model. We find that the trinification model
predicts that several new scalar particles have masses in the
$\mathcal{O}\left(100\text{ GeV}\right)$ range. Moreover, large regions of the
parameter space lead to measurable deviations from Standard-Model predictions
of the Higgs couplings. Hence the trinification model awaits crucial tests at
the Large Hadron Collider in the coming years.

manually merge changes they made to a module (e.g. a class), because the change
conflicts with one that has just been made by another engineer to the same or
another module (e.g. a supplier class). This is due to the fact that engineers
edit code separately, and loosely coordinate their work via a source control or
a software configuration management system (SCM). This work proposes to
eliminate almost all the need to manually merge a recent change, by proposing a
Collaborative Real Time Coding approach. In this approach, valid changes to the
code are seen by others in real time, but intermediate changes (that cause the
code not to compile) result in blocking other engineers from making changes
related to the entity (e.g. method) being modified, while allowing them to work
on most of the system. The subject of collaborative real time editing systems
has been studied for the past 20 years. Research in this field has mostly
concentrated on collaborative textual and graphical editing. In this work we
address the challenges involved in designing a collaborative real time coding

editing of plain text. We then present a prototype plug in for the Eclipse
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that allows for a collaborative coding

Software Development (SSD), which promotes a new mechanism of collaboration in
general, and for code synchronization in particular. In SSD, code changes made
by one developer are automatically propagated to others as long as they keep
the code free of compilation errors. Changes that introduce compilation errors
are not propagated until the errors are fixed. Moreover, other developers are
restricted from concurrently editing the entities involved in these changes.
While in this state, developers are, however, free to modify the rest of the
entities. The novelty of our approach is that it actively synchronizes
developers with the latest error free version of the source code, preventing
possible conflicts and merges that may arise due to concurrent changes made by
fellow team members. SSD also allows for a more transparent an practically near
real time awareness of new code that is being introduced by multiple
developers. We built CSI (Code Synchronizing Intelligence), a prototype
demonstrating key features of SSD.
