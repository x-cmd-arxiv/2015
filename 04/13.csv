zero-forcing precoding for multiuser massive MIMO downlink systems, in which
the base station is equipped with a large-scale antenna array. First, we derive
approximations of the ergodic sum rates of the systems invoking the
conventional random user selection (RUS) and the location-dependant user
selection (LUS). Then, the optimal number of simultaneously served user
equipments (UEs), $K^*$, is investigated to maximize the sum rate
approximations. Upon exploiting $K^*$, we develop two user selection schemes,
namely $K^*$-RUS and $K^*$-LUS, where $K^*$ UEs are selected either randomly or
based on their locations. Both of the proposed schemes are independent of the
instantaneous channel state information of small-scale fading, therefore
enjoying the same extremely-low computational complexity as that of the
conventional RUS scheme. Moreover, both of our proposed schemes achieve
significant sum rate improvement over the conventional RUS. In addition, it is
worth noting that like the conventional RUS, the $K^*$-RUS achieves good
fairness among UEs.

occupation of the quantum dot system down to the few-electron limit. We measure
the charge stability of the double quantum dot in DC transport as well as
dispersively via in-situ gate-based radio frequency reflectometry, where one
top-gate electrode is connected to a resonator. The latter removes the need for
external charge sensors in quantum computing architectures and provides a
compact way to readout the dispersive shift caused by changes in the quantum
capacitance during interdot charge transitions. Here, we observe Pauli
spin-blockade in the high-frequency response of the circuit at finite magnetic
fields between singlet and triplet states. The blockade is lifted at higher
magnetic fields when intra-dot triplet states become the ground state
configuration. A lineshape analysis of the dispersive phase shift reveals
furthermore an intradot valley-orbit splitting $\Delta_{vo}$ of 145 $\mu$eV.

shear measurements in a 139 sq. deg area from the Dark Energy Survey (DES)
Science Verification (SV) data. We compare the distribution of mass with that
of the foreground distribution of galaxies and clusters. The overdensities in
the reconstructed map correlate well with the distribution of optically
detected clusters. We demonstrate that candidate superclusters and voids along
the line of sight can be identified, exploiting the tight scatter of the
cluster photometric redshifts. We cross-correlate the mass map with a
foreground magnitude-limited galaxy sample from the same data. Our measurement
gives results consistent with mock catalogs from N-body simulations that
include the primary sources of statistical uncertainties in the galaxy,
lensing, and photo-z catalogs. The statistical significance of the
cross-correlation is at the 6.8-sigma level with 20 arcminute smoothing. A
major goal of this study is to investigate systematic effects arising from a
variety of sources, including PSF and photo-z uncertainties. We make maps
derived from twenty variables that may characterize systematics and find the
principal components. We find that the contribution of systematics to the
lensing mass maps is generally within measurement uncertainties. In this work,
we analyze less than 3% of the final area that will be mapped by the DES; the
tools and analysis techniques developed in this paper can be applied to
forthcoming larger datasets from the survey.

broad band data we identify which of the three lines we have detected and
assign redshifts accordingly. This results in a well defined, strong emission
line selected sample of galaxies down to lower masses than can easily be
obtained with only continuum flux limited selection techniques. We compare the
(SED fitting-derived) main sequence of star-formation (MS) of our sample to
previous works and find that it has a steeper slope than that of samples of
more massive galaxies. We conclude that the MS steepens at lower (below
$M_{\star} = 10^{9.4} M_{\odot}$) galaxy masses. We also show that the SFR at
any redshift is higher in our sample. We attribute this to the targeted
selection of galaxies with large emission line equivalent widths, and conclude
that our sample presumably forms the upper boundary of the MS. We briefly
investigate and outline how samples with accurate redshifts down to those low
stellar masses open a new window to study the formation of large scale

metric to model non-spherical mass distributions, we first derive a stellar
structure equation for deformed neutron stars. Numerical investigations of this
model equation show that the gravitational masses of deformed neutron stars
depend rather strongly on the degree and type (oblate or prolate) of stellar
deformation. In particular, we find that the mass of a neutron star increases
with increasing oblateness but decreases with increasing prolateness. If this
feature carries over to a full two-dimensional treatment of deformed neutron
stars, this opens up the possibility that, depending on the type of stellar
deformation, there may exist multiple maximum-mass neutron stars for one and
for the same model for the nuclear equation of state.

focus of significant research efforts among physicists, biologists, and

in novel, adaptive ways such as fabricating smart actuators or mimicking living
tissues. Here, we present the controlled growth--like morphing of 2D sheets
into 3D shapes by preparing geometric composite structures that deform by
residual swelling. The morphing of these geometric composites is dictated by
both swelling and geometry, with diffusion controlling the swelling-induced
actuation, and geometric confinement dictating the structure's deformed shape.
Building on a simple mechanical analog, we present an analytical model that
quantitatively describes how the Gaussian and mean curvatures of a thin disk
are affected by the interplay among geometry, mechanics, and swelling. This
model is in excellent agreement with our experiments and numerics. We show that
the dynamics of residual swelling is dictated by a competition between two
characteristic diffusive length scales governed by geometry. Our results
provide the first 2D analog of Timoshenko's classical formula for the thermal
bending of bimetallic beams - our generalization explains how the Gaussian
curvature of a 2D geometric composite is affected by geometry and elasticity.
The understanding conferred by these results suggests that the controlled
shaping of geometric composites may provide a simple complement to traditional
manufacturing techniques.

processes, typically interpreted as synchrotron and inverse Compton emission.
Although the general picture is rather robust and consistent with observations,
many aspects are still unexplored. Polarimetric monitoring can offer a wealth
of information about the physical processes in blazars. Models with largely
different physical ingredients can often provide almost indistinguishable
predictions for the total flux, but usually are characterized by markedly
different polarization properties. We explore, with a pilot study, the
possibility to derive structural information about the emitting regions of
blazars by means of a joint analysis of rapid variability of the total and
polarized flux at optical wavelengths. Short timescale (from tens of seconds to
a couple of minutes) optical linear polarimetry and photometry for two blazars,
BL Lacertae and PKS 1424+240, was carried out with the PAOLO polarimeter at the
3.6m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Several hours of almost continuous
observations were obtained for both sources. Our intense monitoring allowed us
to draw strongly different scenarios for BL Lacertae and PKS 1424+240, with the
former characterized by intense variability on time-scales from hours to a few
minutes and the latter practically constant in total flux. Essentially the same
behavior is observed for the polarized flux and the position angle. The
variability time-scales turned out to be as short as a few minutes, although
involving only a few percent variation of the flux. The polarization
variability time-scale is generally consistent with the total flux variability.
Total and polarized flux appear to be essentially uncorrelated. However, even
during our relatively short monitoring, different regimes can be singled out.

$O(n^3\log(n\rho/\varepsilon))$ elementary balancing operations, where $\rho$
measures the initial imbalance of~$A$ and $\varepsilon$ is the target imbalance
of the output matrix. (The imbalance of~$A$ is $\max_i

$a_i^{\text{out}},a_i^{\text{in}}$ are the maximum entries in magnitude in the

factor. A balancing operation scales the $i$th row and column so that their
maximum entries are equal, and requires $O(m/n)$ arithmetic operations on
average, where $m$ is the number of non-zero elements in~$A$. Thus the running
time of the iterative algorithm is $\tilde{O}(n^2m)$. This is the first time
bound of any kind on any variant of the Osborne-Parlett-Reinsch algorithm. We

AGN and constrain the radius-luminosity ($R-L$) relationship. Here we
investigate the expected efficiency of the OzDES reverberation mapping campaign

a lag, and objects with lags $\lesssim$6 months or $\sim$1 year are expected be

for rapidly-rotating magnetized progenitors. By changing both the strength of
the magnetic field and the spatial resolution, the evolution of the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) and its impacts upon the dynamics are
investigated. We found that the MRI greatly amplifies the seed magnetic fields
in the regime where not the Alfv\'en mode but the buoyant mode plays a primary
role in the exponential growth phase. The MRI indeed has a powerful impact on
the supernova dynamics. It makes the shock expansion faster and the explosion
more energetic, with some models being accompanied by the collimated-jet
formations. These effects, however, are not made by the magnetic pressure
except for the collimated-jet formations. The angular momentum transfer induced
by the MRI causes the expansion of the heating region, by which the accreting
matter gain an additional time to be heated by neutrinos. The MRI also drifts
low-$Y_p$ matter from the deep inside of the core to the heating region, which
makes the net neutrino heating rate larger by the reduction of the cooling due
to the electron capture. These two effects enhance the efficiency of the
neutrino heating, which is found to be the key to boost the explosion. Indeed
we found that our models explode far more weakly when the net neutrino heating
is switched off. The contribution of the neutrino heating to the explosion
energy could reach 60\% even in the case of strongest magnetic field in the
current simulations.

Type Ia supernovae host galaxies over the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.2, and
derive reverberation-mapped black hole masses for approximately 500 active
galactic nuclei and quasars over 0.3 < z < 4.5. This treasure trove of data
forms a major part of the spectroscopic follow-up for the Dark Energy Survey
for which we are also targeting cluster galaxies, radio galaxies, strong
lenses, and unidentified transients, as well as measuring luminous red galaxies
and emission line galaxies to help calibrate photometric redshifts.

Between Dec 2012 and Dec 2013, we observed over 10,000 objects and measured
more than 6,000 redshifts. Our strategy of retargeting faint objects across
many observing runs has allowed us to measure redshifts for galaxies as faint
as m_r=25 mag. We outline our target selection and observing strategy, quantify
the redshift success rate for different types of targets, and discuss the
implications for our main science goals. Finally, we highlight a few
interesting objects as examples of the fortuitous yet not totally unexpected
discoveries that can come from such a large spectroscopic survey.

renormalization group(HWRG) and stochastic quantization(SQ) of scalar field
with arbitrary mass in AdS spacetime. In the stochastic theory, the field is
described by an equation with a form of harmonic oscillator with time dependent
frequency and its Euclidean action also shows explicit time dependent kernel in
it. We have obtained the stochastic 2-point correlation function and
demonstrate that it reproduces the radial evolution of the double trace
operator correctly via the suggested relation given in arXiv:1209.2242.
Moreover, we justify our stochastic procedure with time dependent kernel by
showing that it can be mapped to a new stochastic frame with a standard kernel
without time dependence. Finally, we consider more general boundary conditions
for the stochastic field to reproduce the radial evolution of the holographic
boundary effective action when alternative quantization is allowed. We
extensively study the Neumann boundary condition case and confirm that even in
this case, the relation between HWRG and SQ is precisely hold.

significantly as the cylinder moves away from the channel centerline and

For the full sample, measurements of the angular size $\theta$ provide a tight

of the linear size is small ($|n|\simeq 10^{-2}$) and consistent with previous
analysis. However, a substantial evolution of linear sizes with luminosity is
still required ($\beta\simeq 0.17$). Furthermore, similar analysis done on
sub-samples defined by different source optical counterparts and different
redshift ranges, seems to support the scheme of treating radio galaxies and
quasars with distinct strategies. Finally, a cosmological-model-independent
method is discussed to probe the properties of angular size of milliarcsecond
radio quasars. Using the corrected redshift - angular size relation for quasar

  arXiv:1603.01329",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diffraction gratings are famous for their ability to exhibit, near a Wood
anomaly, an arbitrarily large angular dispersion, e.g., with respect to the
incidence angle or wavelength. For a diffraction grating under incidence by a
plane wave at a fixed frequency, by rotating the incidence angle at a given
angular velocity, the field propagated by a nonzero diffraction order will
rotate at increasingly fast angular velocity as the incidence angle approaches
the angle where Wood anomaly occurs. Such a fast rotating diffracted field has
the potential to generate a substantial Doppler shift. Indeed, under the
assumption of a grating with infinite extent, the expression for the
instantaneous frequency shift perceived by an observer, who is looking into the
light radiated by the diffraction order, is derived and it is in full agreement
with the prediction from an interpretation based on the Doppler shift generated
by a rotation of light sources. In particular the classical (non-relativistic)
Doppler shift can take arbitrarily high values as the incidence angle
approaches a Wood anomaly. It is also found that gratings of a finite size can
have a similar property. In order to have a physically detectable frequency
shift, it is important to use a grating which can maintain a significant
reflectance into higher diffraction orders near their Wood anomaly cut-off.
Interestingly, we have found that the geometry of the nanostructures of a
\emph{Morpho} butterfly wing scale is aptly suited for such a function because
it can strongly reflect into higher diffraction orders while minimising the
reflection into the specular order.

MFRs and contributions of individual neuronal dynamics to population
synchronization change depending on their degrees, unlike the case of full

networks: the graphs that interpolate pointwise between hypercube graphs of
consecutive dimension (the point, line, line and point in the square, square,

circumstellar disk and the compact object of unknown nature, and provide for
the first time high-dispersion (R > 50000) optical spectra in the second half
of the orbital cycle, from apastron through periastron. The Halpha, Hbeta, and
Hgamma line profiles are found to exhibit remarkable short-term variability for
~1 month after the apastron (phase 0.6--0.7), whereas they show little
variation near the periastron. These emission lines show ""S-shaped"" variations
with timescale of ~150 days, which is about twice that reported previously. In
contrast to the Balmer lines, no profile variability is seen in any FeII
emission line. We estimate the radii of emitting regions of the Halpha, Hbeta,
Hgamma, and FeII emission lines to be ~30, 11, 7, and 2 stellar radii (R_*),
respectively. The amplitudes of the line profile variations in different lines
indicate that the interaction with the compact object affects the Be disk down
to, at least, the radius of 7 R_* after the apastron. This fact, together with
little profile variability near the periastron, rules out the tidal force as
the major cause of disk variability. Although this leaves the pulsar wind as
the most likely candidate mechanism for disk variations, understanding the
details of the interaction, particularly the mechanism for causing a
large-scale disk disturbance after the apastron, remains an open question.

nodes should be delivered to other consumer nodes such as actuators in a
regular fashion. But, in practical systems over unreliable media such as
wireless, it is a significant challenge to guarantee small enough
inter-delivery times for different clients with heterogeneous channel
conditions and inter-delivery requirements. In this paper, we design scheduling
policies aiming at satisfying the inter-delivery requirements of such clients.
We formulate the problem as a risk-sensitive Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Although the resulting problem involves an infinite state space, we first prove
that there is an equivalent MDP involving only a finite number of states. Then
we prove the existence of a stationary optimal policy and establish an
algorithm to compute it in a finite number of steps.
  However, the bane of this and many similar problems is the resulting
complexity, and, in an attempt to make fundamental progress, we further propose
a new high reliability asymptotic approach. In essence, this approach considers
the scenario when the channel failure probabilities for different clients are
of the same order, and asymptotically approach zero. We thus proceed to
determine the asymptotically optimal policy: in a two-client scenario, we show
that the asymptotically optimal policy is a ""modified least time-to-go"" policy,
which is intuitively appealing and easily implementable; in the general
multi-client scenario, we are led to an SN policy, and we develop an algorithm
of low computational complexity to obtain it. Simulation results show that the
resulting policies perform well even in the pre-asymptotic regime with moderate
failure probabilities.

have been analyzed to obtain a phase coherent timing solution for the Crab
pulsar glitch of 15 July 2000. The results are: (1) step change in the rotation
frequency $\nu_0$ of the Crab pulsar at the epoch of the glitch is $\Delta
\nu_0 = (30 \pm 3) \times 10^{-9} \times \nu_0$, (2) step change in its time
derivative is $\Delta \dot \nu_0 = (4.8 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-3} \times \dot
\nu_0$, and (3) the time scale of decay of the the step change is $\tau_d = 4.7
\pm 0.5$ days. The first two results are consistent with those obtained at
radio frequencies by the Jodrell Bank observatory. The last result has not been
quoted in the literature, but could be an underestimate due to lack of
observations very close to the glitch epoch. By comparing with the monthly
timing ephemeris published by the Jodrell group for the Crab pulsar, the time
delay between the main peaks of the hard xray and radio pulse profiles is
estimated to be $+411 \pm 167$ $\mu$sec. Although this number is not very
significant, it is consistent with the number derived for the 2 to 16 keV
energy range, using the PCA instrument of RXTE. The separation between the two
peaks of the integrated pulse profile of the Crab pulsar, and the ratio of
their intensities, both are statistically similar before and after the glitch.
The dead time corrected integrated photon flux within the integrated pulse
profile appears to decrease after the glitch, although this is not a
statistically strong result. This work achieves what can be considered to be
almost absolute timing analysis of the Crab pulsar hard xray data.

required for the likelihood function. It is problematic to specify a censoring
mechanism to be taken very seriously in detail, and it appears that
conditioning on censoring is not a viable alternative to that. We circumvent
this matter by employing a reference censoring model, matching the extent and
timing of observed censoring. Our primary proposal is a parametric bootstrap
method utilizing this reference censoring model to simulate inferential
repetitions of the experiment. It is shown that the most important part of
improvement on first-order methods - that pertaining to fitting nuisance
parameters - is insensitive to the assumed censoring model. This is supported
by numerical comparisons of our proposal to parametric bootstrap methods based
on usual random censoring models, which are far more unattractive to implement.
As an alternative to our primary proposal, we provide a second-order method
requiring less computing effort while providing more insight into the nature of
improvement on first-order methods. However, the parametric bootstrap method is
more transparent, and hence is our primary proposal. Indications are that
first-order partial likelihood methods are usually adequate in practice, so we
are not advocating routine use of the proposed methods. It is however useful to
see how best to check on first-order approximations, or improve on them, when

the presence of the tetragonal c-axis in the film plane, thus improving the
magnetic properties. TEM is of critical importance in characterizing these
materials, since conventional XRD cannot always identify the presence of
additional crystallographic orientations although they can still affect the
magnetic properties. Our study points to ways that the microstructure of these

of the parent potentials and redistribution of the energy in the deformed
potentials in the system with spontaneously breaking of parity-time symmetry
while preserving the SUSY of the system. We have observed that the deformation
of the potentials is sensitive to initial conditions. This first experimental
observation enables the localization of eigenspectra in lateral space
(so-called time) and the localization of eigenstates in longitudinal space in
the deformed potentials by experimentally applying the SUSY higher-order
transformations on tilted and disordered parent potentials, respectively. The
former shows a decrease in the slope of the profile of eigenspectrum (bands)
due to the localization in lateral space, while the latter shows an increase in
the slope due to localization in longitudinal space. This allows the formation
of deterministic bandgaps and Bloch waves while retaining the SUSY. In this
configuration, the phase transition emerges naturally in the SUSY deformed
potentials, which are revealed as the quantum Zeno effect and a peculiar
Anderson localization, respectively. The Anderson localization shows the
features of effective amplification and quantum Anti-Zeno effect. The
experimental results are in full agreement with the theory of SUSY deformed
potentials of higher-order transformations. Besides enhancing the understanding
of nature, our results can also provide an experimental platform to originate
new classes of effective and synthetic materials, and are also significantly
important for unifying the interaction dynamics of condensed matter and

solving structured convex optimization problems due to its superior practical
performance. On the theoretical side however, a counterexample was shown in [7]
indicating that the multi-block ADMM for minimizing the sum of $N$ $(N\geq 3)$
convex functions with $N$ block variables linked by linear constraints may
diverge. It is therefore of great interest to investigate further sufficient
conditions on the input side which can guarantee convergence for the
multi-block ADMM. The existing results typically require the strong convexity
on parts of the objective. In this paper, we present convergence and
convergence rate results for the multi-block ADMM applied to solve certain
$N$-block $(N\geq 3)$ convex minimization problems without requiring strong
convexity. Specifically, we prove the following two results: (1) the
multi-block ADMM returns an $\epsilon$-optimal solution within
$O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iterations by solving an associated perturbation to the
original problem; (2) the multi-block ADMM returns an $\epsilon$-optimal
solution within $O(1/\epsilon)$ iterations when it is applied to solve a
certain sharing problem, under the condition that the augmented Lagrangian
function satisfies the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property, which essentially covers
most convex optimization models except for some pathological cases.

coordinated by the main group element, consistent with previous theoretical
work, and reduced when the main group coordination is tetrahedral. By contrast,
in the half Heusler compounds the magnetic moment of the Mn atoms is large and
the oxidation state is +1 or +2. The magnetic and electronic properties of Mn

signature of the kink instability. However, the kink instability threshold for
the filament magnetic structure has been not widely understood. Using the
H-alpha observation from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), we present a
partial eruptive filament. In the eruption, a filament thread appeared to split
from the middle portion of the filament and to break out in a kinklike fashion.
During this period, the left filament material remained below, which erupted
without the kinking motion later on. The coronal magnetic field lines
associated with the filament are obtained from the nonlinear force-free field
(NLFFF) extrapolations using the 12 minutes cadence vector magnetograms of the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory
(SDO). We studied the extrapolated field lines passing through the magnetic
dips that are in good agreement with the observed filament. The field lines are
non-uniformly twisted and appear to be made up by two twisted flux ropes
winding about each other. One of them has higher twist than the other, and the
highly twisted one has its dips aligned with the kinking eruptive thread at the
beginning of its eruption. Before the eruption, moreover, the highly twisted
flux rope was found to expand with the approximately constant field twist. In
addition, the helicity flux maps deduced from the HMI magnetograms show that
some helicity is injected into the overlying magnetic arcade, but no
significant helicity is injected into the flux ropes. Accordingly, we suggest
that the highly twisted flux rope became kink unstable when the instability
threshold declined with the expansion of the flux rope.

  In this paper, we proposed a novel inference attack targeting at SDN/OpenFlow

resulting from frequent interactions between data plane and control plane when
the flow table is full. To our best knowledge, this is the first proposed

while the structure of information networks is better described by modules of
structurally equivalent nodes. However, despite these notable differences, the
structure of sampled networks exhibits stronger characterization by
community-like groups than the original networks, irrespective of their type

  Given the configuration of intersections, for example as a permutation or an

  We address this question in the special case of bi-rainbow meanders, which
are given as non-branched families (rainbows) of nested arcs. Easily obtainable
results for small bi-rainbow meanders containing up to four families suggest an
expression of the number of curves by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of

  We prove however, that this is not the case. In fact, the number of connected

  On the other hand, we provide a complexity analysis of nose-retraction
algorithms. They determine the number of connected components of arbitrary
bi-rainbow meanders in logarithmic time. In fact, the nose-retraction
algorithms resemble the Euclidean algorithm, which is used to determine the
gcd, in structure and complexity.
  Looking for a closed formula of the number of connected components, the
nose-retraction algorithm is as good as a gcd-formula and therefore as good as

observations tend to pick up stronger shocks with flatter radio spectra, while
X-ray observations preferentially select weaker shocks with larger kinetic

also find that the distributions of the spectral index and radio power of the

single motionless massive particle can in principle be in a superposition state

gravitational cat state, would lead to fluctuations in the Newtonian force

as the fluctuations of the Newtonian force. We describe the properties of such

obtain their individual spectra and investigate them as if they were single

stars seem poorly constrained because their luminosities are not in agreement
with the ""standard"" luminosities of stars with similar spectral types. The ages
of these O-type stars are all less than 7 Myrs. Therefore, the ages of these
stars agree with those, quoted in the literature, of the four associations,

(as stiffness) data, mapping of local electrical properties, as bacterial
surface charge, was proved to be feasible at a spatial resolution better than

cantilever's surface stress through its deflection far from (higher than 10nm)
the repulsive contact zone. The variations of surface stress come from
modification of electrical surface charge of the cantilever (as in classical
electrocapillary measurements) likely stemming from its charging during contact
of both tip and sample electrical double layers. This method offers an
important improvement in local electrical and electrochemical measurements at
the solid-liquid interface particularly in high-molarity electrolytes when

providing a strict proof of the existence of entangled quantum states with no

simultaneously high fidelities in the preparation, manipulation and measurement

been tagged as a single-number benchmark for the performance of quantum
computing devices. Here we demonstrate deterministic, on-demand generation of
two-qubit entangled states of the electron and the nuclear spin of a single
phosphorus atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. By sequentially
reading the electron and the nucleus, we show that these entangled states
violate the Bell/CHSH inequality with a Bell signal of 2.50(10). An even higher
value of 2.70(9) is obtained by mapping the parity of the two-qubit state onto
the nuclear spin, which allows for high-fidelity quantum non-demolition
measurement (QND) of the parity. Furthermore, we complement the Bell inequality
entanglement witness with full two-qubit state tomography exploiting QND
measurement, which reveals that our prepared states match the target maximally
entangled Bell states with $>$96\% fidelity. These experiments demonstrate
complete control of the two-qubit Hilbert space of a phosphorus atom, and show
that this system is able to maintain its simultaneously high initialization,
manipulation and measurement fidelities past the single-qubit regime.

discussed in theory and observed in experiments. First, the recently-discovered
transverse spin angular momenta appear in various structured fields: evanescent
waves, interference fields, and focused beams. We show that there are several
kinds of transverse spin angular momentum, which differ strongly in their
origins and physical properties. We describe extraordinary features of the
transverse optical spins and overview recent experiments. In particular, the
helicity-independent transverse spin inherent in edge evanescent waves offers
robust spin-direction coupling at optical interfaces (the quantum spin Hall
effect of light). Second, we overview the transverse orbital angular momenta of
light, which can be both extrinsic and intrinsic. These two types of the
transverse orbital angular momentum are produced by spatial shifts of the
optical beams (e.g., in the spin Hall effect of light) and their Lorentz
boosts, respectively. Our review is underpinned by a unified theory of the
angular momentum of light based on the canonical momentum and spin densities,
which avoids complications associated with the separation of spin and orbital
angular momenta in the Poynting picture. It allows us to construct
comprehensive classification of all known optical angular momenta based on

process in the electroweak model. Integrating out the fermion degrees of
freedom introduces twenty-four fermion determinants. These multiply the
Gaussian functional measures of the Maxwell, $Z$, $W$ and Higgs fields to give
an effective functional measure. Suppose the functional integral over the
Maxwell field is attempted first. This paper is concerned with the large
amplitude behavior of the Maxwell effective measure. It is assumed that the
large amplitude variation of this measure is insensitive to the presence of the
$Z$, $W$ and $H$ fields; they are assumed to be a subdominant perturbation of
the large amplitude Maxwell sector. Accordingly, we need only examine the large
amplitude variation of a single QED fermion determinant. To facilitate this the
Schwinger proper time representation of this determinant is decomposed into a
sum of three terms. The advantage of this is that the separate terms can be
non-perturbatively estimated for a measurable class of large amplitude random
fields in four dimensions. It is found that the QED fermion determinant grows
faster than $\exp \left[ce^2\int\mathrm d^4x\, F_{\mu\nu}^2\right]$, $c>0$, in
the absence of zero mode supporting random background potentials. This raises
doubt on whether the QED fermion determinant is integrable with any Gaussian
measure whose support does not include zero mode supporting potentials.
  Including zero mode supporting background potentials can result in a decaying
exponential growth of the fermion determinant. This is \textit{prima facie}
evidence that Maxwellian zero modes are necessary for the non-perturbative
quantization of QED and, by implication, for the non-perturbative quantization
of the electroweak model.

electromagnetic spectrum, from the radio band to gamma rays. Despite decades of
efforts, many aspects of the physics of relativistic jets remain elusive. In
particular, the location and the mechanisms responsible for the high-energy
emission and the connection of the variability at different wavelengths are
among the greatest challenges in the study of AGN. Recent high resolution radio
observations of flaring objects locate the high-energy emitting region
downstream the jet at parsec scale distance from the central engine, posing
questions on the nature of the seed photons upscattered to gamma-rays.
Furthermore, monitoring campaigns of the most active blazars indicate that not
all the high energy flares have the same characteristics in the various energy
bands, even from the same source, making the interpretation of the mechanism
responsible for the high-energy emission not trivial. Although the variability
of the most luminous blazars is well explained by the ""shock-in-jet"" scenario,
the sub-class of TeV emitting objects suggests a more complex emission model
with velocity gradients in a structured jet. This contribution presents results

individual superbubbles have to merge frequently. If any two superbubbles

them in detail in real materials is difficult. In two- or quasi-two-dimensional
systems, the transition has been studied by computer simulations and
experimentally in electron sheets, dusty plasmas, colloidal and other systems.
Here I show the different stages of defect formation in the vortex lattice of a
superconductor while it undergoes an order-disorder transition by presenting
real-space images of the lattice from scanning tunneling spectroscopy. When the
system evolves from the ordered to the disordered state, the predominant kind
of defect changes from dislocation pairs to single dislocations, and finally to
defect clusters forming grain boundaries. Correlation functions indicate a
hexatic-like state preceding the disordered state. The transition in the
microscopic vortex distribution is mirrored by the well-known spectacular
second peak effect observed in the macroscopic current density of the
superconductor.

their positions in a modality specific coordinate system, often with an unknown

the output of an acoustic self-calibration algorithm by estimating rotation,
scale and translation to the visual coordinate system, while the second solves
a joint system of equations with acoustic and visual directions of arrival as

outperforms the mapping approach and achieves an overall calibration error of

reduced statistical uncertainties in experimental measurements of cosmic-ray
fluxes. In particular, new determinations of traditional diagnostic tools such
as the boron-to-carbon ratio (B/C) are expected to significantly reduce errors
on cosmic-ray diffusion parameters, with important implications for
astroparticle physics, ranging from inferring primary source spectra to
indirect dark matter searches. It is timely to stress, however, that the
conclusions obtained crucially depend on the framework in which the data are
interpreted as well as from some nuclear input parameters. We aim at assessing
the theoretical uncertainties affecting the outcome, with models as simple as
possible while still retaining the key dependencies. We compare different
semi-analytical, two-zone model descriptions of cosmic-ray transport in the
Galaxy. We test for the effect of a primary source contamination in the boron
flux by parametrically altering its flux, as well as for nuclear cross section
uncertainties. Our study on preliminary results from AMS-02 suggests that,
differently for instance from the leptonic case, realistic modelling of the
geometry of the Galaxy and of the source distribution are of minor importance
to correctly reproduce B/C data at high energies and thus, to a large extent,
for the extraction of diffusion parameters. The Ansatz on the lack of primary
injection of boron represents the most serious bias, and requires
multi-messenger studies to be addressed. If this uncertainty could be lifted,
nuclear uncertainties would still represent a serious concern, which degrade
the systematic error on the inferred parameters to the 20% level, or three
times the estimated experimental sensitivity. In order to reduce this, a new
nuclear cross section measurement campaign is probably required.

sub-pc morphology and high frequency spectral structure of $\gamma$-ray

along the jet under the assumption of equipartition between magnetic field and
relativistic particle energies. Making assumptions on the jet magnetic field
configuration (e.g. poloidal or toroidal), we can estimate the separation of
the mm-wave ""core"" and the jet base, and estimate the strength of the magnetic
field there. The results of this analysis show that on average, the magnetic
field strength decreases with a power-law $B \propto r^{-n}$, $n=0.3 \pm 0.2$.
This suggests that on average, the mm-wave ""core"" is $\sim 1-3$\,pc downstream
of the de-projected jet apex and that the magnetic field strength is of the

revealed that the adsorption of coiled DNA onto the membrane surface depended
on the size of the vesicular space. Globular DNA showed a cell-size-dependent

interacted with a two-phase membrane surface, DNA selectively adsorbed on the

It is unclear how these seemingly random cell cycles can be reconciled with the

shorter than the time to replicate the genome. Here we use single molecule
microscopy to map the location of the replication machinery to the division
cycle of individual cells. We find that the cell-to-cell variation in growth
rate is sufficient to explain the corresponding variation in cell size and
division timing assuming a simple mechanistic model. In the model, initiation
of chromosome replication is triggered at a fixed volume per origin region, and
associated with each initiation event is a division event at a growth rate
dependent time later. The result implies that cell division in E. coli has no
other regulation beyond what is needed to initiate DNA replication at the right
volume.

supports the idea that a rapidly rotating Be star can emerge out of a common

thought to be too fast to lead to significant accretion and spin up of the B
star.
  We predict $\sim 10-100$ of B BH binaries to currently reside in the Galactic
disk, among which around $1/3$ contain a Be star, but there is only a small
chance to observe a system with parameters resembling MWC 656. If MWC 656 is
representative of intrinsic Galactic Be BH binary population, it may indicate
that standard evolutionary theory needs to be revised. This would pose another
evolutionary problem in understanding BH binaries, with BH X-ray Novae
formation issue being the prime example.
  The future evolution of MWC 656 with a $\sim 5$ M$_{\odot}$ black hole and
with a $\sim 13$ M$_{\odot}$ main sequence companion on a $\sim 60$ day orbit
may lead to the formation of a coalescing BH-NS system. The estimated Advanced
LIGO/Virgo detection rate of such systems is up to $\sim 0.2$ yr$^{-1}$. This
empirical estimate is a lower limit as it is obtained with only one particular
evolutionary scenario, the MWC 656 binary. This is only a third such estimate
available (after Cyg X-1 and Cyg X-3), and it lends additional support to the
existence of so far undetected BH--NS binaries.

that depend only on the two Lorentz-invariant scalars quadratic in the field
strength. The main idea of the experiment proposed here is to use the fact
that, according to non-linear electrodynamics, the phase velocity of light
should depend on the strength and on the direction of an electromagnetic
background field. There are two possible experimental set-ups for testing this
prediction with Michelson interferometry. The first possibility is to apply a
strong electromagnetic field to the beam in one arm of the interferometer and
to compare the situation where the field is switched on with the situation
where it is switched off. The second possibility is to place the whole
interferometer in a strong electromagnetic field and to rotate it. If an
electromagnetic field is placed in one arm, the interferometer could have the
size of a gravitational wave detector, i.e., an arm-length of several hundred
meters. If the whole interferometer is placed in an electromagnetic field, one
would have to do the experiment with a table-top interferometer. [...] We
specify the general results to some particular theories of the Pleba\'nski

suggested the existence of a warm T around 0.5-1 keV and optically thick, \tau
~ 10-20, corona covering the inner parts of the accretion disk. These
properties are directly derived from spectral fitting in UV to soft-X-rays
using Comptonization models. However, whether such a medium can be both in
radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium with an accretion disk is still
uncertain. We investigate the properties of such warm, optically thick coronae
and put constraints on their existence. We solve the radiative transfer
equation for grey atmosphere analytically in a pure scattering medium,
including local dissipation as an additional heating term in the warm corona.
The temperature profile of the warm corona is calculated assuming it is cooled
by Compton scattering, with the underlying dissipative disk providing photons
to the corona. Our analytic calculations show that a dissipative thick,
(\tau_{cor} ~ 10-12) corona on the top of a standard accretion disk can reach
temperatures of the order of 0.5-1 keV in its upper layers provided that the
disk is passive. But, in absence of strong magnetic fields, the requirement of
a Compton cooled corona in hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction
sets an upper limit on the Thomson optical depth \tau_{cor} < 5 . We show this
value cannot be exceeded independently of the accretion disk parameters.
However, magnetic pressure can extend this result to larger optical depths.
Namely, a dissipative corona might have an optical depth up to ~ 20 when the
magnetic pressure is 100 times higher that the gas pressure. The observation of
warm coronae with Thomson depth larger than ~ 5 puts tights constraints on the
physics of the accretion disk/corona systems and requires either strong
magnetic fields or vertical outflows to stabilize the system.

increase in contact time and mass evolution of the quasifission fragments with
increasing (N/Z)CN, which is indicative of an increase in the fusion

DNA-mediated multivalent interactions of a single liposome adhering to a flat

of mobile linkers. With at most one fitting parameter, our theory is capable of
semi-quantitatively matching experimental data, confirming the quality of the

however, is conventionally predicted as a function of mass. Hence, the
intrinsic scatter and the uncertainties in the scaling relations between mass
and either temperature or luminosity lower the reliability of galaxy clusters
to constrain cosmological parameters. In this article, we further refine the
X-ray temperature function for galaxy clusters by Angrick et al., which is
based on the statistics of perturbations in the cosmic gravitational potential
and proposed to replace the classical mass-based temperature function, by
including a refined analytic merger model and compare the theoretical
prediction to results from a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. Although
we find already a good agreement if we compare with a cluster temperature
function based on the mass-weighted temperature, including a redshift-dependent
scaling between mass-based and spectroscopic temperature yields even better

Such a term, first studied by Deardorff in the meteorological context, might
represent the effects of cold intense downdrafts caused by the rapid cooling in
the granulation layer at the top of the convection zone of late-type stars.
Such intense downdrafts were first seen in the strongly stratified simulations
of Stein & Nordlund in the late 1980s. These downdrafts transport heat
nonlocally, a phenomenon referred to as entropy rain. Moreover, the Deardorff
term can cause upward enthalpy transport even in a weakly Schwarzschild-stably
stratified layer. In that case, no giant cell convection would be excited. This
is interest in view of recent observations, which could be explained if the
dominant flow structures were of small scale even at larger depths. To study
this possibility, three distinct flow structures are examined: one in which
convective structures have similar size and mutual separation at all depths,
one in which the separation increases with depth, but their size is still
unchanged, and one in which both size and separation increase with depth, which
is the standard flow structure. It is concluded that the third possibility with
fewer and thicker downdrafts in deeper layers remains most plausible, but it
may be unable to explain the suspected absence of large-scale flows with speeds
and scales expected from MLT.

galaxy halo mass and the total mass in its globular cluster (GC) population,
M_{GCS} ~ M_h^{1.03 \pm 0.03}, valid over 5 orders of magnitude. We explore the
nature of this correlation for galaxies of different morphological types, and
for the subpopulations of metal-poor (blue) and metal-rich (red) GCs. For the
subpopulations of different metallicity we find M_{GCS}(blue) ~ M_h^{0.96 \pm
0.03} and M_{GCS}(red) ~ M_h^{1.21 \pm 0.03} with similar scatter. The
numerical values of these exponents can be derived from the detailed behavior
of the red and blue GC fractions with galaxy mass and provide a self-consistent
set of relations. In addition, all morphological types (E, S0, S/Irr) follow
the same relation, but with a second-order trend for spiral galaxies to have a
slightly higher fraction of metal-rich GCs for a given mass. These results
suggest that the amount of gas available for GC formation at high redshift was
in nearly direct proportion to the dark-matter halo potential, in strong
contrast to the markedly nonlinear behavior of total stellar mass versus halo
mass. Of the few available theoretical treatments that directly discuss the
formation of GCs in a hierarchical merging framework,the model of Kravtsov &
Gnedin (2005) best matches these observations. They find that the blue,
metal-poor GCs formed in small halos at $z > 3$ and did so in nearly direct
proportion to halo mass. Similar models addressing the formation rate of the
red, metal-richer GCs in the same detail and continuing to lower redshift are
still needed for a comprehensive picture.

the nebula appears as a clumpy ring shell that extends up to 1.2 pc with an
inner radius of 0.4 pc. It coincides with the Halpha nebula, but extends
further out. Dust modeling of the nebula was performed and indicates the
presence of large grains. The dust mass is estimated to be ~ 0.2 Msun. The
infrared spectrum of the nebula consists of forbidden emission lines over a
dust continuum. Apart from ionized gas, these lines also indicate the existence
of neutral gas in a photodissociation region that surrounds the ionized region.
The abundance ratios point towards enrichment by processed material. The total
mass of the nebula ejected from the central star amounts to ~ 15 Msun, assuming
a dust-to-gas ratio typical of LBVs. The abundances and the mass-loss rate were
used to constrain the evolutionary path of the central star and the epoch at
which the nebula was ejected, with the help of available evolutionary models.
This suggests an ejection during a cool LBV phase for a star of ~ 55 Msun with
little rotation.

range of applications, the algorithm designer is often left with many
algorithmic choices, for example, the size of the population, the mutation
rates, and the crossover rates of the algorithm. These parameters are known to
have a crucial influence on the optimization time, and thus need to be chosen
carefully, a task that often requires substantial efforts. Moreover, the
optimal parameters can change during the optimization process. It is therefore
of great interest to design mechanisms that dynamically choose best-possible
parameters. An example for such an update mechanism is the one-fifth success
rule for step-size adaption in evolutionary strategies. While in continuous
domains this principle is well understood also from a mathematical point of
view, no comparable theory is available for problems in discrete domains.
  In this work we show that the one-fifth success rule can be effective also in
discrete settings. We regard the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$~GA proposed in
[Doerr/Doerr/Ebel: From black-box complexity to designing new genetic
algorithms, TCS 2015]. We prove that if its population size is chosen according
to the one-fifth success rule then the expected optimization time on
\textsc{OneMax} is linear. This is better than what \emph{any} static

  Evolution Planning",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile network operators are facing the difficult task of significantly
increasing capacity to meet projected demand while keeping CAPEX and OPEX down.
We argue that infrastructure sharing is a key consideration in operators'
planning of the evolution of their networks, and that such planning can be
viewed as a stage in the cognitive cycle. In this paper, we present a framework
to model this planning process while taking into account both the ability to
share resources and the constraints imposed by competition regulation (the
latter quantified using the Herfindahl index). Using real-world demand and
deployment data, we find that the ability to share infrastructure essentially
moves capacity from rural, sparsely populated areas (where some of the current
infrastructure can be decommissioned) to urban ones (where most of the
next-generation base stations would be deployed), with significant increases in
resource efficiency. Tight competition regulation somewhat limits the ability
to share but does not entirely jeopardize those gains, while having the
secondary effect of encouraging the wider deployment of next-generation
technologies.

minimum (i.e. in their inherent structure, IS) were found to support a non-zero
shear stress. This IS stress was attributed to the constraint to the energy
minimization imposed by boundary conditions, which keep size and shape of the
simulation cell fixed. In this paper we further investigate the influence of
these boundary conditions on the IS stress. We investigate its importance for
the computation of the low frequency shear modulus of a glass obtaining a
consistent picture for the low- and high frequency shear moduli over the full
temperature range. Hence, we find that the IS stress corresponds to a
non-thermal contribution to the fluctuation term in the Born-Green expression.
This leads to an unphysical divergence of the moduli in the low temperature
limit if no proper correction for this term is applied. Furthermore, we clarify
the IS stress dependence on the system size and put its origin on a more formal

sum of the fixed costs of the selected arcs plus the sum of variable costs
associated to the flows on each arc. Besides that, since the FCNDP-UOF is a

generate a initial solution using a variable fixing heuristic. Then a local

an efficient perturbation strategy is presented to perform cycle-based moves to

relationship between Gamma_gamma and peak Compton frequency v_C. This behavior
is derived analytically using an equipartition blazar model with a log-parabola
description of the electron energy distribution (EED). In the Thomson regime, k
= k_EC = 3b/4 for external Compton processes and k = k_SSC = 9b/16 for
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) processes, where b is the log-parabola width
parameter of the EED. The BL Lac object Mrk 501 is fit with a synchrotron/SSC
model given by the log-parabola EED, and is best fit away from equipartition.
Corrections are made to the spectral-index diagrams for a low-energy power-law
EED and departures from equipartition, as constrained by absolute jet power.
Analytic expressions are compared with numerical values derived from
self-Compton and external Compton scattered gamma-ray spectra from Ly alpha
broad-line region and IR target photons. The Gamma_gamma vs. v_s behavior in
the model depends strongly on b, with progressively and predictably weaker
dependences on gamma-ray detection range, variability time, and isotropic
gamma-ray luminosity. Implications for blazar unification and blazars as

multiple times with femtosecond laser pulses is thoroughly investigated over a
wide range of fluences. The resultant laser-induced surface topographies can be
categorized into two different regimes. In the low fluence regime
$(F_{{\Sigma}line,max} < 130 ~J/cm^2)$, ellipsoidal cones (randomly distributed
surface protrusions covered by several layers of nanoparticles) are formed.
Based on chemical, crystallographic, and topographical analyses, we conclude
that these ellipsoidal cones are composed of unablated steel whose conical
geometry offers a significant degree of fluence reduction (35-52%). Therefore,
the rest of the irradiated area is preferentially ablated at a higher rate than
the ellipsoidal cones. The second, or high fluence regime
$(F_{{\Sigma}line,max} > 130~ J/cm^2)$ consists of laser-induced surface
patterns such as columnar and chaotic structures. Here, the surface topography
showed little to no change even when the target was scanned repeatedly. This is
in stark contrast to the ellipsoidal cones in the first regime, which evolve
and grow continuously as more laser passes are applied.
