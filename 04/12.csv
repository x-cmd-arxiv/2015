  sparse graphs",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are several notions of convergence for sequences of bounded degree
graphs. One such notion is left convergence, which is based on counting
neighborhood distributions. Another notion is right convergence, based on
counting homomorphisms to a target (weighted) graph. Borgs, Chayes, Kahn and
Lov\'asz showed that a sequence of bounded degree graphs is left convergent if
and only if it is right convergent for certain target graphs $H$ with all
weights (including loops) close to $1$. We give a short alternative proof of
this statement. In particular, for each bounded degree graph $G$ we associate
functions $f_{G,k}$ for every positive integer $k$, and we show that left
convergence of a sequence of graphs is equivalent to the convergence of the
partial derivatives of each of these functions at the origin, while right
convergence is equivalent to pointwise convergence. Using the bound on the
maximum degree of the graphs, we can uniformly bound the partial derivatives at
the origin, and show that the Taylor series converges uniformly on a domain
independent of the graph, which implies the equivalence.

is usually assumed. The important quantities of the B(d) system, such as sin
(2beta) and Delta m(d), are determined under this assumption. However, the
meson system interacts with its environment. This interaction can lead to
decoherence in the mesons even before they decay. In our formalism this
decoherence is modelled by a single parameter lambda. It is desirable to
re-examine the procedures of determination of sin(2beta) and Delta m(d) in
meson systems with decoherence. We find that the present values of these two
quantities are modulated by lambda. Re-analysis of B(d) data from B-factories

reaching ramifications for the construction of mobile impurity models used to

can achieve spectral accuracy in space and simultaneously maintain high

mantle convection and for gasses under high pressure. The equations are subject
to a both temperature gradient on the boundary and internal heating in the bulk
driven by a stochastic, white in time, gaussian forcing. Here, the stochastic
source terms have a strong physical motivation for example as a model of
radiogenic heating. Our approach uses mixing properties of the formal limit
system to reduce the convergence of invariant states to an analysis of the
finite time asymptotics of solutions and parameter-uniform moment bounds. Here,
it is notable that there is a phase space mismatch between the finite Prandtl
system and the limit equation, and we implement methods to lift both finite and

velocity fields. For the infinite Prandtl stochastic Boussinesq equations, we
show that the associated invariant measure is unique and that the dual

speeds and more rapid decay, with height, of magnetic fields in potential
coronal models above eruption sites. Here, we compare the roles of both ribbon
fluxes and the decay rates of overlying fields in a set of 16 eruptive events.
We confirm previous results that higher CME speeds are associated with both
larger ribbon fluxes and more rapidly decaying overlying fields. We find the
association with ribbon fluxes to be weaker than a previous report, but
stronger than the dependence on the decay rate of overlying fields. Since the
photospheric ribbon flux is thought to approximate the amount of coronal
magnetic flux reconnected during the event, the correlation of speeds with
ribbon fluxes suggests that reconnection plays some role in accelerating CMEs.
One possibility is that reconnected fields that wrap around the rising ejection
produce an increased outward hoop force, thereby increasing CME acceleration.
The correlation of CME speeds with more rapidly decaying overlying fields might
be caused by greater downward magnetic tension in stronger overlying fields,
which could act as a source of drag on rising ejections.

regressor and many instruments. I use invariance arguments to construct a new
minimum distance objective function. With respect to a particular weight
matrix, the minimum distance estimator is equivalent to the random effects
estimator of Chamberlain and Imbens (2004), and the estimator of the
coefficient on the endogenous regressor coincides with the limited information
maximum likelihood estimator. This weight matrix is inefficient unless the
errors are normal, and I construct a new, more efficient estimator based on the
optimal weight matrix. Finally, I show that when the minimum distance objective
function does not impose a proportionality restriction on the reduced-form
coefficients, the resulting estimator corresponds to a version of the
bias-corrected two-stage least squares estimator. I use the objective function
to construct confidence intervals that remain valid when the proportionality
restriction is violated.

  dimensional reduction of ordinal data",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The literature on clustering for continuous data is rich and wide;
differently, that one developed for categorical data is still limited. In some
cases, the problem is made more difficult by the presence of noise
variables/dimensions that do not contain information about the clustering
structure and could mask it. The aim of this paper is to propose a model for
simultaneous clustering and dimensionality reduction of ordered categorical
data able to detect the discriminative dimensions discarding the noise ones.
Following the underlying response variable approach, the observed variables are
considered as a discretization of underlying first-order latent continuous
variables distributed as a Gaussian mixture. To recognize discriminative and
noise dimensions, these variables are considered to be linear combinations of
two independent sets of second-order latent variables where only one contains
the information about the cluster structure while the other contains noise
dimensions. The model specification involves multidimensional integrals that
make the maximum likelihood estimation cumbersome and in some cases infeasible.
To overcome this issue the parameter estimation is carried out through an
EM-like algorithm maximizing a pairwise log-likelihood. Examples of application
of the model on real and simulated data are performed to show the effectiveness
of the proposal.

digits, whose information content would allow storage in only 32 bits. However,
we may require that arithmetic operations involving these numbers be done with
64-bit floating-point precision, which precludes simply representing the data
as 32-bit floating-point values. Decimal floating point gives a compact and
exact representation, but requires conversion with a slow division operation
before it can be used. Here, I show that interesting subsets of 64-bit
floating-point values can be compactly and exactly represented by the 32 bits
consisting of the sign, exponent, and high-order part of the mantissa, with the
lower-order 32 bits of the mantissa filled in by table lookup, indexed by bits
from the part of the mantissa retained, and possibly from the exponent. For
example, decimal data with 4 or fewer digits to the left of the decimal point
and 2 or fewer digits to the right of the decimal point can be represented in
this way using the lower-order 5 bits of the retained part of the mantissa as
the index. Data consisting of 6 decimal digits with the decimal point in any of
the 7 positions before or after one of the digits can also be represented this
way, and decoded using 19 bits from the mantissa and exponent as the index.
Encoding with such a scheme is a simple copy of half the 64-bit value, followed
if necessary by verification that the value can be represented, by checking
that it decodes correctly. Decoding requires only extraction of index bits and
a table lookup. Lookup in a small table will usually reference cache; even with
larger tables, decoding is still faster than conversion from decimal floating
point with a division operation. I discuss how such schemes perform on recent
computer systems, and how they might be used to automatically compress large
arrays in interpretive languages such as R.

Misaligned circumstellar discs have systematically larger outer radii than

WSP and CSP pay the IoTSP (push model). Next, we consider the model where the
end-users independently pay the each provider (pull model). Finally, we
consider a hybrid model of the above two where the IoTSP and WSP quote their

  We characterize and quantify the impact of the advertisement revenue on the
equilibrium pricing strategy and payoff of providers, and corresponding demands
of end users in each of the above interaction models. Our analysis reveals that
the demand of end-users, and the payoffs of the providers are non decreasing
functions of the advertisement revenue. For sufficiently high advertisement
revenue, the IoTSP will offer its service free of cost in each interaction
model. However, the payoffs of the providers, and the demand of end-users vary

IoTSP is always higher in the pull model irrespective of the advertisement
revenue. The payoff of the CSP is the highest in the hybrid model in the low
advertisement revenue regime. However, in the high advertisement revenue regime
the payoff of the CSP in the hybrid model or in the push model can be higher

stellar populations in the Galactic disk through astrometric microlensing.
Furthermore, we study if some information about their mass distributions can be
inferred via this method. In this regard, we simulate the binary astrometric
microlensing events due to massive stellar populations according to the Gaia
observing strategy by considering (a) stellar-mass black holes, (b) neutron
stars, (c) white dwarfs and (d) main-sequence stars as microlenses. The Gaia
efficiency for detecting the binary signatures in binary astrometric
microlensing events is $\sim 10-20$ per cent. By calculating the optical depth
due to the mentioned stellar populations, the number of the binary astrometric
microlensing events being observed with Gaia with detectable binary signatures,
for the binary fraction about 0.1, is estimated as 6, 11, 77 and 1316
respectively. Consequently, Gaia can potentially specify the binary fractions
of these massive stellar populations. However, the binary fraction of black
holes measured with this method has the large uncertainty owing to a low number
of the estimated events. Knowing the binary fractions in massive stellar
populations helps for studying the gravitational waves. Moreover, we
investigate the number of massive microlenses which Gaia specifies their masses
through astrometric microlensing of single lenses toward the Galactic bulge.
The resulted efficiencies of measuring the mass of mentioned populations are
9.8, 2.9, 1.2 and 0.8 per cent respectively. The number of their astrometric
microlensing events being observed in the Gaia era in which the lens mass can
be inferred with the relative error less than 0.5 toward the Galactic bulge is
estimated as 45, 34, 76 and 786 respectively.

tenuous, magnetized, and highly ionized X-ray emitting plasmas. This overall
collisionless, viscous, and conductive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in
ICM is simulated using hyper and physical magnetic diffusivity. The results
show that fluctuating random plasma motion amplifies the magnetic field, which
cascades toward the diffusivity scale passing through the viscous scale. The
kinetic eddies in the subviscous scale are driven and constrained by the
magnetic tension which finally gets balanced with the highly damping effect of
the kinetic eddies. However, the saturated kinetic energy spectrum is deeper
than that of the incompressible or compressible hydrodynamics fluid. To explain
this unusual field profile we set up two simultaneous differential equations
for the kinetic and magnetic energy spectrum using an Eddy Damped Quasi Normal
Markovianized (EDQNM) approximation. The analytic solution tells us that the
magnetic energy in addition to the viscous damping effect constrains the plasma
motion leading to the power spectra: kinetic energy spectrum $E_V^k\sim k^{-3}$
and corresponding representative magnetic energy spectrum $E_M^k\sim k^{-1/2}$.
Also the comparison of simulation results with different resolutions and
magnetic diffusivities implies the role of small scale magnetic energy in
dynamo.

helicoidal configurations while the partition function is a sum over the path
trajectories describing the base pair fluctuational states. The stablest
helical repeat of every minicircle is determined by free energy minimization.
We find that, for molecules with $N$ larger than $100$, the helical repeat
grows linearly with the size and the twist number is constant. On the other
hand, by reducing the size below $100$ base pairs, the double helices sharply
unwind and the twist number drops to one for $N=\,20$. This is predicted as the

the painstaking power-charging problem inherent in various wireless terminals.
This paper investigates the power transfer efficiency of the WPT segment in
future communication systems in support of simultaneous power and data
transfer, by means of analytically computing the time-average output direct
current (DC) power at user equipments (UEs). In order to investigate the effect
of channel variety among UEs on the average output DC power, different policies
for the scheduling of the power transfer among the users are implemented and
compared in two scenarios: homogeneous, whereby users are symmetric and
experience similar path loss, and heterogeneous, whereby users are asymmetric
and exhibit different path losses. Specifically, if opportunistic scheduling is
performed among $N$ symmetric/asymmetric UEs, the power scaling laws are
attained by using extreme value theory, and reveal that the gain in power
transfer efficiency is $\ln{N}$ if UEs are symmetric whereas the gain is $N$ if
UEs are asymmetric, compared with that of conventional round-robin scheduling.
Thus, the channel variety among UEs inherent to the wireless environment can be
exploited by opportunistic scheduling to significantly improve the power
transfer efficiency when designing future wireless communication systems in
support of simultaneous power and data transfer.

anti-de Sitter black holes in D-dimensional space times. Convexity of
thermodynamic potentials and the analytic structure of the response functions
is analysed. The thermodynamic potentials can be used to define a metric on the
space of thermodynamic variables and two commonly used such metrics are the
Weinhold metric, derived from the internal energy, and the Ruppeiner metric,
derived from the entropy. The intrinsic curvature of these metrics is
calculated for charged and for rotating black holes and it is shown that the
curvature diverges when heat capacities diverge but, contrary to general
expectations, the singularities in the Ricci scalars do not reflect the
critical behaviour.
  When a cosmological constant is included as a state space variable it can be
interpreted as a pressure and the thermodynamically conjugate variable as a
thermodynamic volume. The geometry of the resulting extended thermodynamic
state space is also studied, in the context of rotating black holes, and there
are curvature singularities when the heat capacity at constant angular velocity
diverges and when the black hole is incompressible. Again the critical
behaviour is not visible in the singularities of the thermodynamic Ricci
scalar.

latent order book breaks the dynamical equilibrium between the flows,
triggering the large price jumps. On smaller time scales (30 seconds), instead,
the static depletion of the limit order book is an indicator of an intrinsic
fragility of the system, which is related to a strongly non linear enhancement
of the response. In order to quantify this phenomenon we introduce a measure of
the liquidity imbalance present in the book and we show that it is correlated

However, it is still not clear what kind of states can be reversibly converted

the reversibility of LOCC conversions between two bipartite pure entangled
states in the asymptotic setting. In addition, we show that conversion can be
achieved perfectly with only local unitary operation under such condition
except for special cases. Interestingly, our result implies that an error-free
reversible conversion is asymptotically possible even between states whose
copies can never be locally unitarily equivalent with any finite numbers of
copies, although such a conversion is impossible in the finite setting. In
fact, we show such an example. Moreover, we establish how to overcome the
irreversibility of LOCC conversion in two ways. As for the first method, we
evaluate how many copies of the initial state is to be lost to overcome the
irreversibility of LOCC conversion. The second method is to add a supplementary
state appropriately, which also works for LU conversion unlike the first
method. Especially, for the qubit system, any non-maximally pure entangled
state can be a universal resource for the asymptotic reversibility when copies
of the state is sufficiently many. More interestingly, our analysis implies
that far-from-maximally entangled states can be better than nearly maximally
entangled states as this type of resource. This fact brings new insight to the
resource theory of state conversion.

reported by BESIII. It is pointed out that this process is fully described, up
to one overall coupling constant, in the soft pion limit. An interpretation of
the available and possible future data within the discussed theoretical

the observed relative yield for this process at different energies strongly
suggests a very significant enhancement of the amplitude at the charmoniumlike
peak near 4.36\,GeV.

descriptions of their physical and chemical evolution. In particular, are the
accretion rates smoothly declining from the earlier toward later stages or in
fact characterized by variations such as intermittent bursts? We aim to
characterize the impact of possible accretion variations in a sample of
embedded protostars by measuring the size of the inner regions of their
envelopes where CO is sublimated and relate those to their temperature profiles
dictated by their current luminosities. Using observations from the
Submillimeter Array we measure the extents of the emission from the C18O
isotopologue toward 16 deeply embedded protostars. We compare these
measurements to the predicted extent of the emission given the current
luminosities of the sources through dust and line radiative transfer
calculations. Eight out of sixteen sources show more extended C18O emission
than predicted by the models. The modeling shows that the likely culprit for
these signatures is sublimation due to increases in luminosities of the sources
by about a factor five or more during the recent 10,000 years - the time it
takes for CO to freeze-out again on dust grains. For four of those sources the
increase would have had to have been a factor 10 or more. The compact emission
seen toward the other half of the sample suggests that C18O only sublimates
when the temperature exceeds 30 K - as one would expect if CO is mixed with H2O
in the grain ice-mantles. The small-number statistics from this survey suggest
that protostars undergo significant bursts about once every 20,000 years. This
also illustrates the importance of taking the physical evolutionary histories
into account for descriptions of the chemical structures of embedded
protostars.

We incorporate the uncertainties associated with cluster mass, redshift, and
BCG stellar mass measurements into analysis of a redshift-dependent BCG-cluster
mass relation, $m_{*}\propto(\frac{M_{200}}{1.5\times
10^{14}M_{\odot}})^{0.24\pm 0.08}(1+z)^{-0.19\pm0.34}$, and compare the
observed relation to the model prediction. We estimate the average growth rate
since $z = 1.0$ for BCGs hosted by clusters of $M_{200, z}=10^{13.8}M_{\odot}$,
at $z=1.0$: $m_{*, BCG}$ appears to have grown by $0.13\pm0.11$ dex, in tension
at $\sim 2.5 \sigma$ significance level with the $0.40$ dex growth rate
expected from the semi-analytic model. We show that the buildup of extended
