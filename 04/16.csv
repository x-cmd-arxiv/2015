introduced one-scale H-measures, a generalisation of H-measures with a

carrying out some alternative proofs, and strengthening some results, comparing
these objects to known microlocal defect functionals. Furthermore, we improve
and generalise Tartar's localisation principle for these objects from which we
are able to derive the known localisation principles for both H-measures and

constitutes a significant share of infrastructure costs in future heterogeneous
networks (HetNets). To address this issue, the emerging idea of flexible
backhaul is proposed. Under this architecture, not all the pico BSs are
connected to the backhaul, resulting in a significant reduction in the
infrastructure costs. In this regard, pico BSs without backhaul connectivity
need to communicate with their nearby BSs in order to have indirect
accessibility to the backhaul. This makes the radio resource management (RRM)
in such networks more complex and challenging. In this paper, we address the
problem of cross-layer RRM in HetNets with flexible backhaul. We formulate this
problem as a two-timescale non-convex stochastic optimization which jointly
optimizes flow control, routing, interference mitigation and link scheduling in
order to maximize a generic network utility. By exploiting a hidden convexity
of this non-convex problem, we propose an iterative algorithm which converges
to the global optimal solution. The proposed algorithm benefits from low
complexity and low signalling, which makes it scalable. Moreover, due to the
proposed two-timescale design, it is robust to the backhaul signalling latency
as well. Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance gain of the
proposed solution over various baselines.

are also adaptive; they simultaneously allow several machine learning

computer-aided diagnosis systems. The high anatomical variability of organs in
the abdomen, such as the pancreas, prevents many segmentation methods from
achieving high accuracies when compared to other segmentation of organs like
the liver, heart or kidneys. Recently, the availability of large annotated
training sets and the accessibility of affordable parallel computing resources
via GPUs have made it feasible for ""deep learning"" methods such as
convolutional networks (ConvNets) to succeed in image classification tasks.
These methods have the advantage that used classification features are trained
directly from the imaging data. We present a fully-automated bottom-up method
for pancreas segmentation in computed tomography (CT) images of the abdomen.
The method is based on hierarchical coarse-to-fine classification of local
image regions (superpixels). Superpixels are extracted from the abdominal
region using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC). An initial probability
response map is generated, using patch-level confidences and a two-level
cascade of random forest classifiers, from which superpixel regions with
probabilities larger 0.5 are retained. These retained superpixels serve as a
highly sensitive initial input of the pancreas and its surroundings to a
ConvNet that samples a bounding box around each superpixel at different scales
(and random non-rigid deformations at training time) in order to assign a more
distinct probability of each superpixel region being pancreas or not. We
evaluate our method on CT images of 82 patients (60 for training, 2 for
validation, and 20 for testing). Using ConvNets we achieve average Dice scores
of 68%+-10% (range, 43-80%) in testing. This shows promise for accurate
pancreas segmentation, using a deep learning approach and compares favorably to
state-of-the-art methods.

A central numerical observation is that there are two branches of canards in
parameter space which extend across all positive forcing frequencies. For
low-frequency forcing, we demonstrate the existence of primary maximal canards
induced by folded saddle-nodes of type I, and establish explicit formulas for
the parameter values at which the primary maximal canards and their folds
exist. We then turn to the intermediate- and high-frequency forcing regimes,
and show that the fvdP equation possesses torus canards instead. These torus
canards consist of long segments near families of attracting and repelling
limit cycles of the fast system, in alternation. We also derive explicit
formulas for the parameter values at which the maximal torus canards and their
folds exist. Primary maximal canards and maximal torus canards correspond
geometrically to the situation in which the persistent manifolds near the
family of attracting limit cycles coincide to all orders with the persistent
manifolds that lie near the family of repelling limit cycles. The formulas
derived for the folds of maximal canards in all three frequency regimes turn
out to be representations of a single formula in the appropriate parameter
regimes, and this unification confirms our numerical observation. In addition,
we study the secondary canards induced by the folded singularities in the
low-frequency regime and find that their fold curves turn around in the
intermediate-frequency regime. We identify the mechanism responsible for this
turning. Finally, we show that the fvdP equation is a normal form for a class
of single-frequency periodically-driven slow/fast systems with two fast
variables and one slow variable which possess a nondegenerate fold of limit
cycles.

The formulation of this minimal model is motivated by the experimentally
observed widespread variation of neural firing thresholds. We show numerically
that the mean first passage time can depend non-monotonically on the noise
amplitude. For sufficiently large values of the correlation time of the
stochastic threshold the mean first passage time is maximal for non-vanishing
noise. We provide an explanation for this effect by analytically transforming
the original model into a first passage time problem for Brownian motion. This
transformation also allows for a perturbative calculation of the first passage
time histograms. In turn this provides quantitative insights into the
mechanisms that lead to the non-monotonic behaviour of the mean first passage
time. The perturbation expansion is in excellent agreement with direct
numerical simulations. The approach developed here can be applied to any
deterministic subthreshold dynamics and any Gauss-Markov processes for the
firing threshold. This opens up the possibility to incorporate biophysically
detailed components into the subthreshold dynamics, rendering our approach a
powerful framework that sits between traditional integrate-and-fire models and
complex mechanistic descriptions of neural dynamics.

messages to cellular users using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) with
physical-layer rate awareness. While most of the existing literature on IDNC
does not consider any physical layer complications and abstract the model as
equally slotted time for all users, this paper proposes a cross-layer scheme
that incorporates the different channel rates of the various users in the
decision process of both the transmitted message combinations and the rates
with which they are transmitted. The consideration of asymmetric rates for
receivers reflects more practical application scenarios and introduces a new
trade-off between the choice of coding combinations for various receivers and
the broadcasting rate for achieving shorter completion time. The completion
time minimization problem in such scenario is first shown to be intractable.
The problem is, thus, approximated by reducing, at each transmission, the
increase of an anticipated version of the completion time. The paper solves the
problem by formulating it as a maximum weight clique problem over a newly
designed rate aware IDNC (RA-IDNC) graph. The highest weight clique in the
created graph being potentially not unique, the paper further suggests a
multi-layer version of the proposed solution to improve the obtained results
from the employed completion time approximation. Simulation results indicate
that the cross-layer design largely outperforms the uncoded transmissions
strategies and the classical IDNC scheme.

a consequence of the onset of deconfinement occurring in the compression stage

the acceptance cuts off too much of the low-$p_T$ proton spectrum and/or puts
too narrow rapidity window around midrapidity. It is found that the shape of

  publication in PRD",,,,"hep-ph hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Production and decays of doubly charged Higgs bosons at the LHC and future
hadron colliders triggered by vector boson fusion mechanism are discussed in
the context of the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model. Our analysis is based on
the Higgs boson mass spectrum compatible with available constraints which
include FCNC effects and vacuum stability of the scalar potential. Though the
parity breaking scale $v_R$ is large ($\sim$ few TeV) and scalar masses which
contribute to FCNC effects are even larger, consistent Higgs boson mass
spectrum still allows us to keep doubly charged scalar masses below 1 TeV which
is an interesting situation for LHC and future FCC colliders. We have shown
that allowed Higgs bosons mass spectrum constrains the splittings
($M_{H_{1}^{\pm \pm}}-M_{H_{1}^\pm}$), closing the possibility of
$H_{1}^{\pm\pm}\to W_{1}^\pm H_{1}^\pm$ decays. Assuming that doubly charged
Higgs bosons decay predominantly into a pair of same sign charged leptons
through the process $p p \rightarrow H_{1/2}^{\pm \pm} H_{1/2}^{\mp \mp} j j
\rightarrow \ell^{\pm} \ell^{\pm} \ell^{\mp} \ell^{\mp} jj$, we find that for
LHC operating at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV with an integrated luminosity at the level
of $3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ (HL-LHC) there is practically no chance to detect
such particles at the reasonable significance level through this channel.
However, 33 TeV HE-LHC and (or) 100 TeV FCC-hh open up a wide region for doubly
charged Higgs boson mass spectrum to be explored. In FCC-hh, doubly charged
Higgs bosons mass up to 1 TeV can be probed easily.

years. It was shown that Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics is not the only
modification of the linear Maxwell's field which keeps the electric field of a
charged point particle finite at the origin, and other type of nonlinear
Lagrangian such as exponential and logarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics can
play the same role. In this paper, we generalize the study on the exponential
nonlinear electrodynamics by adding a scalar dilaton field to the action. By
suitably choosing the coupling of the matter field to the dilaton field, we
vary the action and obtain the corresponding field equations. Then, by making a
proper ansatz, we construct a new class of charged dilaton black hole solutions
coupled to the exponential nonlinear electrodynamics field in the presence of
two Liouville-type potentials for the dilaton field. Due to the presence of the
dilaton field, the asymptotic behavior of these solutions are neither flat nor
(A)dS. In the limiting case where the nonlinear parameter $\beta^2$ goes to
infinity, our solution reduces to the Einstein-Maxwell dilaton black holes. We
obtain the mass, temperature, entropy and electric potential of these
solutions. We also study the behaviour of the electric field as well as the
electric potential of these black holes near the origin. We find that the
electric field has a finite value \textit{near} the origin, which is the same
as the electric field of Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics, but it can
diverge exactly at $r=0$ depending on the model parameters. We also investigate
the effects of the dilaton field on the behaviour of the electric field and
electric potential. Finally, we check the validity of the first law of black
hole thermodynamics on the black hole horizon.

ameliorate the tuning in the weak scale and address the little hierarchy
problem, and c) The factor of $3$ arising from $N_c$ in the top-loop Higgs mass
corrections is countered by a factor $3$ from the number of vector-like

pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (pNGB) Higgs models such as the Twin Higgs, as
well as more general Composite, Little, and Orbifold Higgs scenarios, and three
simple example models are presented. This framework firmly predicts a TeV-scale
seesaw, as the RHN masses are bounded to be below the TeV scale by naturalness.
The generation of light neutrino masses relies on a collective breaking of
lepton number, allowing for comparatively large neutrino Yukawa couplings and a
rich associated phenomenology. The structure of the neutrino mass mechanism
realizes in certain limits the Inverse or Linear classes of seesaw. Natural
Neutrino models are testable at a variety of current and future experiments,

misalignment of the baryonic components (hot gas and stars) of galaxies with
their host halo as a function of halo mass, radius, redshift, and galaxy type
(centrals vs satellites and early- vs late-type). Overall, galaxies align well
with the local distribution of the total (mostly dark) matter. However, the
stellar distributions on galactic scales exhibit a median misalignment of about
45-50 degrees with respect to their host haloes. This misalignment is reduced
to 25-30 degrees in the most massive haloes ($13 < log_{10}(M_{200}/

have a misalignment angle with respect to their host haloes larger than 40
degrees. We present fitting functions and tabulated values for the probability

scales by employing free carrier (FC) excitation. Such unprecedented switching

In the first realization, we rely on diffusion, i.e., on the nonlocality of the
FC nonlinear response of the semiconductor, to erase the initial FC pattern
and, thereby, eliminate the reflectivity of the system. In the second
realization, we erase the FC pattern by launching a second pump pulse at a
controlled delay. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed
approaches and demonstrate their potential applicability for switching
ultrashort pulses propagating in silicon waveguides. We show switching
efficiencies of up to $50\%$ for $100$ fs pump pulses, which is an unusually
high level of efficiency for such a short interaction time, a result of the use
of the strong FC nonlinearity. Due to limitations of saturation and pattern
effects, these schemes can be employed for switching applications that require
femtosecond features but standard repetition rates. Such applications include
switching of ultrashort pulses, femtosecond spectroscopy (gating),
time-reversal of short pulses for aberration compensation, and many more. This
approach is also the starting point for ultrafast amplitude modulations and a
new route toward the spatio-temporal shaping of short optical pulses.

principle, use the derived transit timing variation (TTV) of some transiting
planets observed by the $Kepler$ mission to distinguish between prograde and
retrograde motion of their orbits with respect to their parent stars' rotation.
The approach utilizes TTVs induced by spot-crossing events that occur when the
planet moves across a spot on the stellar surface, looking for a correlation
between the derived TTVs and the stellar brightness derivatives at the
corresponding transits. This can work even in data that cannot temporally
resolve the spot-crossing events themselves. Here we apply this approach to the
$Kepler$ KOIs, identifying nine systems where the photometric spot modulation
is large enough and the transit timing accurate enough to allow detection of a
TTV-brightness-derivatives correlation. Of those systems five show highly
significant prograde motion (Kepler-17b, Kepler-71b, KOI-883.01, KOI-895.01,
and KOI-1074.01), while no system displays retrograde motion, consistent with
the suggestion that planets orbiting cool stars have prograde motion. All five
systems have impact parameter $0.2\lesssim b\lesssim0.5$, and all systems
within that impact parameter range show significant correlation, except
HAT-P-11b where the lack of a correlation follows its large stellar obliquity.
Our search suffers from an observational bias against detection of high impact
parameter cases, and the detected sample is extremely small. Nevertheless, our
findings may suggest that stellar spots, or at least the larger ones, tend to
be located at a low stellar latitude, but not along the stellar equator,
similar to the Sun.

Sun's total irradiance variations at different points in the Sun's activity

  Five teams took part in the blind exercise, plus two teams who participated
after the content of the light curves had been released. The methods used
included Lomb-Scargle periodograms and variants thereof, auto-correlation

differential rotation. The results show that the `overall' period is well
recovered for stars exhibiting low and moderate activity levels. Most teams
reported values within 10% of the true value in 70% of the cases. There was,
however, little correlation between the reported and simulated values of the

broadband X-ray spectra are dominated by a primary power-law emission (with the
photon index ~ 2). This emission is affected by at least three absorbers with
different ionisations (log(xi) ~ 1-4). The spectrum is further shaped by a
reprocessed emission, possibly coming from two regions -- the accretion disc
and a more distant scattering region. The accretion disc emission is smeared by
the relativistic effects, from which we measured the spin of the black hole as
a ~ 0.8 (+-0.2). We found that most of the spectral variability can be
attributed to the least ionised absorber whose column density changed by a
factor of two between the first (highest-flux) and the last (lowest-flux)

is located at the distance ~ 0.05 pc from the centre, i.e., in the Broad Line

(ALCF) to separate and quantify phase information in the large-scale structure
of galaxies. The line correlation function probes the strictly non-linear
regime of structure formation and since phase information drops out of the
power spectrum, the line correlation function provides a complementary tool to
commonly used techniques based on two-point statistics. Furthermore, it is
independent of linear bias as well as the Gaussian variance on the modulus of
the density field and thus may also prove to be advantageous compared to the
bispectrum or similar higher-order statistics for certain cases. For future
applications it is vital, though, to be able to account for observational
effects that cause anisotropies in the distribution of galaxies. Based on a
number of numerical studies, we find that our ALCF is well suited to accomplish
this task and we demonstrate how the Alcock-Paczynski effect and kinematical
redshift-space distortions can in principle be measured via the ALCF.

the reliability of our fitted periods is a complicated function of the period,

in agreement with previous density estimates. For 5-20km diameters, S types
rotate faster and have lower amplitudes than C types. If both populations share

challenge of assembling supermassive black holes by $z>6$ to explain the bright
quasars observed at this epoch. The formation of a DCBH seed with $\rm
M_{BH}\sim10^{4-5}\ \rm M_{\odot}$ requires a pristine atomic-cooling halo to
be illuminated by an external radiation field that is sufficiently strong to
entirely suppress H$_{2}$ cooling in the halo. Many previous studies have
attempted to constrain the critical specific intensity that is likely required
to suppress H$_{2}$ cooling, denoted as $J_{\rm crit}$. However, these studies
have typically assumed that the incident external radiation field can be
modeled with a black-body spectrum. Under this assumption, it is possible to
derive a {unique} value for $J_{\rm crit}$ that depends only on the temperature
of the black-body. In this study we consider a more realistic spectral energy
distribution (SED) for the external source of radiation that depends entirely
on its star formation history and age. The rate of destruction of the species
responsible for suppressing molecular hydrogen cooling depends on the detailed
shape of the SED. Therefore the value of $J_{\rm crit}$ is tied to the shape of
the incident SED of the neighbouring galaxy. We fit a parametric form to the
rates of destruction of H$_2$ and H$^-$ that permit direct collapse. Owing to
this, we find that $J_{\rm crit}$ is not a fixed threshold but can lie anywhere
in the range $J_{\rm crit} \sim 0.5$--$10^{3}$, depending on the details of the
source stellar population.

show differences in the explosion sites of, in particular SNe types II and Ibc
(SNe II and SNe Ibc), suggesting differences in population ages. Of particular
interest is that SNe Ic are significantly more associated with H-alpha emission
than SNe Ib, implying shorter lifetimes for the former. In addition, such
studies have shown that the interacting SNe IIn do not explode in regions
containing the most massive stars, which suggests that at least a significant
fraction of their progenitors arise from the lower end of the core-collapse SN
mass range. Host HII region spectroscopy has been obtained for a significant
number of core-collapse events, however definitive conclusions have to-date
been elusive. Single stellar evolution models predict that the fraction of SNe
Ibc to SNe II should increase with increasing metallicity, due to the
dependence of mass-loss rates on progenitor metallicity. We present a
meta-analysis of host HII region oxygen abundances for CC SNe. It is concluded
that the SN II to SN Ibc ratio shows little variation with oxygen abundance,
with only a suggestion that the ratio increases in the lowest bin. Radial
distributions of different SNe are discussed, where a central excess of SNe Ibc
has been observed within disturbed galaxy systems, which is difficult to
ascribe to metallicity or selection effects. Environment studies are evolving
to enable studies at higher spatial resolutions than previously possible, while
in addition the advent of wide-field integral field unit instruments allows
galaxy-wide spectral analyses which will provide fruitful results to this
field. Some example contemporary results are shown in that direction.

this work is a precise characterization of when a variable ordering is
'semantically equivalent' to the variable ordering given by the input FAQ
expression. Then, we design an approximation algorithm to find an equivalent

idle (is inactive) with probability $1-p_k$. Whenever active, each node
performs an update by weight-averaging its solution estimate with the estimates
of its active neighbors, taking a negative gradient step with respect to its
local cost, and performing a projection onto the constraint set; inactive nodes
perform no updates. Assuming that nodes' local costs are strongly convex, with
Lipschitz continuous gradients, we show that, as long as activation probability
$p_k$ grows to one asymptotically, our algorithm converges in the mean square

i.e., as if all the nodes were active at all iterations. Moreover, when $p_k$
grows to one linearly, with an appropriately set convergence factor, the
algorithm has a linear MSS convergence, with practically the same factor as the
standard distributed gradient method. Simulations on both synthetic and real

anomaly term is observed and it is canceled within errors by the contribution
from the pseudoscalar term in the disconnected insertion in the heavy quark
region. On the other hand, net negative contributions are obtained for the
light and strange quarks in the disconnected insertion, since their quark
pseudoscalar terms are smaller than that of the heavy quark. Our results are

demonstrated recently in engineering and structural biology. Here, we focus on
synchronization over $\mathbb{Z}_2$, and consider the problem of identifying
communities in a multiplex network when the interaction between the nodes is
described by a signed (possibly weighted) measure of similarity, and when the
multiplex network has a natural partition into two communities. When one has
the additional information that certain subsets of nodes represent the same
unknown group element, we consider and compare several algorithms based on
spectral, semidefinite programming (SDP) and message passing algorithms. In
other words, all nodes within such a subset represent the same unknown group
element, and one has available noisy pairwise measurements between pairs of
nodes that belong to different non-overlapping subsets. Following a recent
analysis of the eigenvector method for synchronization over SO(2), we analyze
the robustness to noise of the eigenvector method for synchronization over
$\mathbb{Z}_2$, when the underlying graph of pairwise measurements is the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph, using results from the random matrix theory
literature. We also propose a message passing synchronization algorithm that
outperforms the existing eigenvector synchronization algorithm only for certain
classes of graphs and noise models, and enjoys the flexibility of incorporating
constraints that may not be easily accommodated by other spectral or SDP-based

for the need to explore the environment under limited visibility. We consider
both metrical and topological interactions. Moreover, a few special agents, the
leaders, not recognized as such by the crowd, are ""hidden"" in the crowd with a
special controlled dynamics. Next, relying on a Boltzmann approach, we derive a
mesoscopic model for a continuum density of followers, coupled with a
microscopic description for the leaders' dynamics. Finally, optimal control of
the crowd is studied. It is assumed that leaders exploit the herding effect in
order to steer the crowd towards the exits and reduce clogging. Locally-optimal
behavior of leaders is computed. Numerical simulations show the efficiency of
the optimization methods in both microscopic and mesoscopic settings. We also
perform a real experiment with people to study the feasibility of the proposed

Using the analytic solutions from Xue et al. (2013) and ignoring the effects of
the magnetic field configuration, we estimate the BZ and neutrino annihilation
luminosities as the functions of the disk masses and BH spin parameters to
contrast the observational jet luminosities of GRBs. The results show that,
although the neutrino annihilation processes could account for most of GRBs,
the BZ mechanism is more effective, especially for long-duration GRBs.
Actually, if the energy of afterglows and flares of GRBs is included, the
distinction between these two mechanisms is more significant. Furthermore,
massive disk mass and high BH spin are beneficial to power high luminosities of
GRBs. Finally, we discuss possible physical mechanisms to enhance the disk mass
or the neutrino emission rate of NDAFs and relevant difference between these

chains that form a generalized restless bandit system. First, an optimal
algorithm is derived for the case of one user. The algorithm maximizes
throughput subject to an average power constraint. Next, the one-user algorithm
is extended to a low complexity heuristic for the multi-user problem. The
heuristic uses a simple online index policy. In a special case with no
power-constraint, the multi-user heuristic is shown to be throughput optimal.
Simulations are used to demonstrate effectiveness of the heuristic in the
general case. For simple cases where the optimal solution can be computed
offline, the heuristic is shown to be near-optimal for a wide range of

local densities of photonic states, which are different from that in vacuum.
These modified density of states environments are known to control both the
rate and angular distribution of spontaneous emission. In the present study, we
ask the question whether the proximity to metallic and metamaterial surfaces
can affect other physical phenomena of fundamental and practical importance. We
show that the same substrates and the same nonlocal dielectric environments
that boost spontaneous emission, also inhibit F\""orster energy transfer between
donor and acceptor molecules doped into a thin polymeric film. This finding
correlates with the fact that in dielectric media, the rate of spontaneous
emission is proportional to the index of refraction n, while the rate of the
donor-acceptor energy transfer (in solid solutions with random distribution of
acceptors) is proportional to n^-1.5. This heuristic correspondence suggests
that other classical and quantum phenomena, which in regular dielectric media
depend on n, can also be controlled with custom-tailored metamaterials,
plasmonic structures, and cavities.

future networking. Although exciting progress has been made toward realizing
SDN, application of this new networking paradigm in the future Internet to
support end-to-end QoS provisioning faces some new challenges. The autonomous
network domains coexisting in the Internet and the diverse user applications
deployed upon the Internet call for a uniform Service Delivery Platform (SDP)
that enables high-level network abstraction and inter-domain collaboration for
end-to-end service provisioning. However, the currently available SDN
technologies lack effective mechanisms for supporting such a platform. In this
paper, we first present a SDP framework that applies the Network-as-a-Service
(NaaS) principle to provide network abstraction and orchestration for
end-to-end service provisioning in SDN-based future Internet. Then we focus our
study on two enabling technologies for such a SDP to achieve QoS guarantee;
namely a network abstraction model and an end-to-end resource allocation
scheme. Specifically we propose a general model for abstracting the service
capabilities offered by network domains and develop a technique for determining
the required amounts of bandwidth in network domains for end-to-end service
delivery with QoS guarantee. Both the analytical and numerical results obtained
in this paper indicate that the NaaS-based SDP not only simplifies SDN service
and resource management but also enhances bandwidth utilization for end-to-end
QoS provisioning.

magnetic-field decay in a superconductor (SC). Like as the mass acquirement of
photons in SC is the origin of the magnetic-field decay, the polymer earns
uncrossible intersections along the chain due to the preserved linking number,
which restricts the deviation of the transverse polymer current in the normal
direction. Interestingly, this picture is well incorporated with the most
successful phenomenological theory of the so called tube model, of which
researchers have long pursued its microscopic origin. The correspondence of our
equation of motion to the tube model claims that the confining tube potential
is a consequence of the topological constraint (linking number). The tube
radius is attributed to the decay length, and increasing the retracting force
at intersections or increasing the number of intersections (linking number),
the tube becomes narrow and tighter. It further shows that the probability of
the tube leakage decays exponentially with the decay length of tube radius.

perturbing the Schwarzschild data on $\Sigma_0$ and solving the Einstein vacuum
equations backwards in time. We obtain a local well-posedness result for small
perturbations lying in certain weighted Sobolev spaces. No symmetry assumptions
are imposed. The perturbed spacetimes all have a singularity at a ""collapsed""

metric match those of their Schwarzschild counterparts to a suitably high
order. As in the Schwarzschild backward evolution, the pinched initial
hypersurface $\Sigma_0$ `opens up' instantly, becoming a smooth spacelike
(cylindrical) hypersurface. This result thus yields classes of examples of
non-symmetric vacuum spacetimes, evolving forward-in-time from smooth initial

rely on a precise asymptotic analysis of the Schwarzschild geometry near the

  Wireless Systems","Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Physical layer multicasting with opportunistic user selection (OUS) is
examined for multicell multi-antenna wireless systems. By adopting a two-layer
encoding scheme, a rate-adaptive channel code is applied in each fading block
to enable successful decoding by a chosen subset of users (which varies over
different blocks) and an application layer erasure code is employed across
multiple blocks to ensure that every user is able to recover the message after
decoding successfully in a sufficient number of blocks. The transmit signal and
code-rate in each block determine opportunistically the subset of users that
are able to successfully decode and can be chosen to maximize the long-term
multicast efficiency. The employment of OUS not only helps avoid
rate-limitations caused by the user with the worst channel, but also helps
coordinate interference among different cells and multicast groups. In this
work, efficient algorithms are proposed for the design of the transmit
covariance matrices, the physical layer code-rates, and the target user subsets
in each block. In the single group scenario, the system parameters are
determined by maximizing the group-rate, defined as the physical layer
code-rate times the fraction of users that can successfully decode in each
block. In the multi-group scenario, the system parameters are determined by
considering a group-rate balancing optimization problem, which is solved by a
successive convex approximation (SCA) approach. To further reduce the feedback
overhead, we also consider the case where only part of the users feed back
their channel vectors in each block and propose a design based on the balancing
of the expected group-rates. In addition to SCA, a sample average approximation
technique is also introduced to handle the probabilistic terms arising in this
problem. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is demonstrated by computer
simulations.

large distances perpendicular to the plane out to projected distances of ~9-10
kpc away from the nucleus and ~13-14 kpc at the edge of the disk. A novel
technique, based on interactive profile fitting, was used to separate the main
disk gas from the anomalous (halo) gas. The rotation curve (RC) derived for the
HI disk confirms that it is declining in the outer parts, as seen in previous
optical Fabry-Perot measurements. As for the anomalous component, its RC has a
very shallow gradient in the inner parts and turns over at the same radius as
the disk, kinematically lagging by ~100 km/sec. The kinematics of the observed
extra planar gas is compatible with an outflow due to the central starburst and
galactic fountains in the outer parts. However, the gas kinematics shows no
evidence for inflow. Analysis of the near-IR WISE data, shows clearly that the
star formation rate (SFR) is compatible with the starburst nature of NGC 253.

more expensive than their counterparts in visible imaging. As a result,
high-resolution imaging in those spectrum remains beyond the reach of most
consumers. Over the last decade, compressive sensing (CS) has emerged as a
potential means to realize inexpensive short-wave infrared cameras. One
approach for doing this is the single-pixel camera (SPC) where a single
detector acquires coded measurements of a high-resolution image. A
computational reconstruction algorithm is then used to recover the image from
these coded measurements. Unfortunately, the measurement rate of a SPC is
insufficient to enable imaging at high spatial and temporal resolutions.
  We present a focal plane array-based compressive sensing (FPA-CS)
architecture that achieves high spatial and temporal resolutions. The idea is
to use an array of SPCs that sense in parallel to increase the measurement
rate, and consequently, the achievable spatio-temporal resolution of the
camera. We develop a proof-of-concept prototype in the short-wave infrared
using a sensor with 64$\times$ 64 pixels; the prototype provides a 4096$\times$

Universe at redshifts z=2-3.5 by measuring the cross-correlation of Lya surface
brightness with quasars in SDSS/BOSS. We use a million spectra targeting
Luminous Red Galaxies at z<0.8, after subtracting a best fit model galaxy
spectrum from each one, as an estimate of the high-redshift Lya surface
brightness. The quasar-Lya emission cross-correlation we detect has a shape
consistent with a LambdaCDM model with Omega_M =0.30^+0.10-0.07. The predicted
amplitude of this cross-correlation is proportional to the product of the mean
Lya surface brightness, <mu_alpha>, the amplitude of mass fluctuations, and the
quasar and Lya emission bias factors. Using known values, we infer
<mu_alpha>(b_alpha/3) = (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 10^-21 erg/s cm^-2 A^-1 arcsec^-2,
where b_alpha is the Lya emission bias factor. If the dominant sources of Lya
emission are star forming galaxies, we infer rho_SFR = (0.28 +/- 0.07)
(3/b_alpha) /yr/Mpc^3 at z=2-3.5. For b_alpha=3, this value is a factor of
21-35 above previous estimates from individually detected Lya emitters,
although consistent with the total rho_SFR derived from dust-corrected,
continuum UV surveys. 97% of the Lya emission in the Universe at these
redshifts is therefore undetected in previous surveys of Lya emitters. Our
measurement is much greater than seen from stacking analyses of faint halos
surrounding previously detected Lya emitters, but we speculate that it arises
from similar Lya halos surrounding all luminous star-forming galaxies. We also
detect redshift space anisotropy of the quasar-Lya emission cross-correlation,
finding evidence at the 3.0 sigma level that it is radially elongated,
consistent with distortions caused by radiative-transfer effects (Zheng et al.
(2011)). Our measurements represent the first application of the intensity
mapping technique to optical observations.

  via a Gaussian copula model","TO appear in CSDA",,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) refers to a family of inference
methods used in the Bayesian analysis of complex models where evaluation of the
likelihood is difficult. Conventional ABC methods often suffer from the curse
of dimensionality, and a marginal adjustment strategy was recently introduced
in the literature to improve the performance of ABC algorithms in
high-dimensional problems. The marginal adjustment approach is extended using a
Gaussian copula approximation. The method first estimates the bivariate
posterior for each pair of parameters separately using a 2-dimensional Gaussian
copula, and then combines these estimates together to estimate the joint
posterior. The approximation works well in large sample settings when the
posterior is approximately normal, but also works well in many cases which are
far from that situation due to the nonparametric estimation of the marginal
posterior distributions. If each bivariate posterior distribution can be well
estimated with a low-dimensional ABC analysis then this Gaussian copula method
can extend ABC methods to problems of high dimension. The method also results
in an analytic expression for the approximate posterior which is useful for
many purposes such as approximation of the likelihood itself. This method is
illustrated with several examples.

Mode Functions (IMFs). In the first energy preserving EMD (EPEMD) algorithm, a
signal is decomposed into linearly independent (LI), non orthogonal yet energy
preserving (LINOEP) IMFs and residue (EPIMFs). It is shown that a vector in an
inner product space can be represented as a sum of LI and non orthogonal
vectors in such a way that Parseval's type property is satisfied. From the set
of $n$ IMFs, through Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method (GSOM), $n!$ set of
orthogonal functions can be obtained. In the second algorithm, we show that if
the orthogonalization process proceeds from lowest frequency IMF to highest
frequency IMF, then the GSOM yields functions which preserve the properties of
IMFs and the energy of a signal. With the Hilbert transform, these IMFs yield
instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes as functions of time that reveal the
imbedded structures of a signal. The instantaneous frequencies and square of
amplitudes as functions of time produce a time-frequency-energy distribution,
referred as the Hilbert spectrum, of a signal. Simulations have been carried
out for the analysis of various time series and real life signals to show
comparison among IMFs produced by EMD, EPEMD, ensemble EMD and multivariate EMD
algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate the power of this proposed method.

institute. Hence, many educational institutes continuously improve their
service to produce a supportive learning environment to satisfy the student
need. For this reason, educational institutions collect student satisfaction
data to make decision about institutional quality, but till now it cannot be
determined because student satisfaction is a complex matter which is influenced
by variety of characteristics of students and institutions. There are many
studies have been performed to inspect student satisfaction in the form of
college services, programs, student accommodation facility, student-faculty
interaction, consulting hours etc. So, still we cannot have a standard method
to know what is going on about satisfaction in the case of a core course. In
this research we determined the attributes that heavily affect student
satisfaction in a core course of computer science and the current status of
other attributes as well.

  ""Gauge Theory and Differential Geometry"" published by Nova Editors.",,,,"math.DG math-ph math.AP math.MP physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1870, R. Clausius found the virial theorem which amounts to introduce the
trace of the stress tensor when studying the foundations of thermodynamics, as
a way to relate the absolute temperature of an ideal gas to the mean kinetic
energy of its molecules. In 1901, H. Poincar{\'e} introduced a duality
principle in analytical mechanics in order to study lagrangians invariant under
the action of a Lie group of transformations. In 1909, the brothers E. and F.
Cosserat discovered another approach for studying the same problem though using
quite different equations. In 1916, H. Weyl considered again the same problem
for the conformal group of transformations, obtaining at the same time the
Maxwell equations and an additional specific equation also involving the trace
of the impulsion-energy tensor. Finally, having in mind the space-time
formulation of electromagnetism and the Maurer-Cartan equations for Lie groups,
gauge theory has been created by C.N. Yang and R.L. Mills in 1954 as a way to
introduce in physics the differential geometric methods available at that time,
independently of any group action, contrary to all the previous approaches. The
main purpose of this paper is to revisit the mathematical foundations of
thermodynamics and gauge theory by using new differential geometric methods
coming from the formal theory of systems of partial differential equations and
Lie pseudogroups, mostly developped by D.C Spencer and coworkers around 1970.
In particular, we justify and extend the virial theorem, showing that the
Clausius/Cosserat/Maxwell/Weyl equations are nothing else but the formal
adjoint of the Spencer operator appearing in the canonical Spencer sequence for
the conformal group of space-time and are thus totally dependent on the group
action. The duality principle also appeals to the formal adjoint of a linear
differential operator used in differential geometry and to the extension
modules used in homological algebra.

terms of the bit-error-rate (BER) performance. However theoretically the

clear. In this paper, we set the theoretical framework to analyze the
performance of systematic polar codes. The exact evaluation of the BER of
systematic polar codes conditioned on the BER of non-systematic polar codes
involves in $2^{NR}$ terms where $N$ is the code block length and $R$ is the
code rate, resulting in a prohibitive number of computations for large block

successive-cancellation (SC) decoding process, we use a statistical model to
quantify the advantage of systematic polar codes over non-systematic polar
codes, so called the systematic gain in this paper. A composite model is
proposed to approximate the dominant error cases in the SC decoding process.
This composite model divides the errors into independent regions and coupled
regions, controlled by a coupling coefficient. Based on this model, the
systematic gain can be conveniently calculated. Numerical simulations are

conduction band originating from defective layers, an overlap between the
valence- and conduction-band edge states at the interface layers, and zone
folding with quantum confinement effects on the conduction band of
non-defective bulk-like Si. The fact that almost all structural portions of the

  In general, the resulting core radii are in good comparison with the current
literature values. However, our half-light radii are slightly lower than the
literature. The concentrations (and therefore also the tidal radii) are poorly
constrained mostly because of the limited radial extent of our imaging.
Therefore, we extensively discuss the effects of a limited field-of-view on the
derived parameters using mosaicked SDSS data, which do not suffer from this
restriction. We also illustrate how red giant branch (RGB) stars in cluster
cores can stochastically induce artificial peaks in the surface brightness
profiles. The issues related to these bright stars are scrutinised based on
both our photometry and simulated clusters. We also examine colour gradients
and find that the strongest central colour gradients are caused by central RGB
stars and thus not representative for the cluster light or colour distribution.
  We recover the known relation between the half-light radius and the
Galactocentric distance in the g-band, but find a lower slope for redder
filters. We did not find a correlation between the scatter on this relation and
other cluster properties. We find tentative evidence for a correlation between
the half-light radii and the [Fe/H], with metal-poor GCs being larger than
metal-rich GCs. However, we conclude that this trend is caused by the position
of the clusters in the Galaxy, with metal-rich clusters being more centrally
located.

observing interval. Prior to the year 2000, the source S4 0917+624 was one of
the most prominent IDV sources. Our new data indicate that the previous strong
IDV has ceased. We analyzed the long-term VLBI structural variability using
Gaussian model-fitting. From this we obtained the flux densities and the
deconvolved sizes of core and inner-jet components of the source. We studied
the properties such as core fraction, angular size, spectral index, and
brightness temperature of VLBI core for S4 0917+624, as well as the time delay
between 5 and 15 GHz variations, and compared them with the IDV properties of
S4 0917+624. The source shows ejection of several jet components that are
suspected to have partially reduced the IDV amplitude of S4 0917+624. However,
during 2005-2006, the VLBI core size was comparable to the size before the year
2000, but no strong IDV was detected in the period, suggesting that the
quenching effect due to source size changes may not be responsible for the lack
of strong IDV after the year 2000. The refractive scattering properties for the
strong IDV phase of S4 0917+624 before the year 2000 are discussed. The
disappearance of strong IDV in S4 0917+624 after the year 2000 is a mystery and
cannot be explained via the quenching effect by changes in the observable VLBI
structure. However, it may be caused by changes in the interstellar medium,
i.e. by interstellar weather, which induces changes in the scintillation
pattern on timescales of several years. Further coordinated multi-frequency
observations will be required to distinguish between the effect of
source-intrinsic variability and changing properties of the interstellar

that common, hexagonal (Ih) water ice is the archetype of a frustrated material
: a proton-bonded network in which protons satisfy strong local constraints -
the ""ice rules"" - but do not order. While this proton disorder is well
established, there is now a growing body of evidence that quantum effects may
also have a role to play in the physics of ice at low temperatures. In this
Article we use a combination of numerical and analytic techniques to explore
the nature of proton correlations in both classical and quantum models of ice
Ih. In the case of classical ice Ih, we find that the ice rules have two,
distinct, consequences for scattering experiments - singular ""pinch points"",
reflecting a zero-divergence condition on the uniform polarization of the
crystal, and broad, asymmetric features, coming from its staggered
polarisation. In the case of the quantum model, we find that the collective
quantum tunnelling of groups of protons can convert states obeying the ice
rules into a quantum liquid, whose excitations are birefringent, emergent
photons. We make explicit predictions for scattering experiments on both
classical and quantum ice Ih, and show how the quantum theory can explain the
""wings"" of incoherent inelastic scattering observed in recent neutron
scattering experiments [Bove et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 165901 (2009)].
These results raise the intriguing possibility that the protons in ice Ih could
form a quantum liquid at low temperatures, in which protons are not merely
disordered, but continually fluctuate between different configurations obeying
the ice rules.

cosmic rays (UHECRs) are different when dealing with hadron or photon
primaries. The current experiments combine two different techniques, an array
of surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The latter allow an almost
calorimetric measurement of the primary energy. Thus, hadron-initiated showers
detected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator
from the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance
from the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this
calibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high
energy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte
Carlo parametrizations are used instead.
  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of
hadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously
developed for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that
relate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum
development of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.
Then, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since
S(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed. Considering
a mixed sample of ultra-high energy proton and iron primaries and taking into
account the reconstruction uncertainties and shower to shower fluctuations, we
demonstrate that the primary energy may be determined with a systematic
uncertainty below 1% and resolution around 16% in the energy range from
10^{18.5} to 10^{19.6} eV. Several array geometries, the shape of the energy
error distributions and the uncertainties due to the unknown composition of the
primary flux have been analyzed as well.

atmospheric refraction under the condition of lower angles of elevation is

observational research of the atmospheric refraction at lower angles of
elevation has an important significance. It has been considered difficult to
measure the atmospheric refraction at lower angles of elevation. A new idea for
determining atmospheric refraction by utilizing differential measurement with
double fields of view is proposed. Taking the observational principle of
HIPPARCOS satellite as a reference, a schematic prototype with double fields of
view was developed. In August of 2013, experimental observations were carried
out and the atmospheric refractions at lower angles of elevation can be
obtained by the schematic prototype. The measured value of the atmospheric
refraction at the zenith distance of 78.8 degree is $240.23""\pm0.27""$, and the
feasibility of differential measurement of atmospheric refraction with double
fields of view was justified. The limitations of the schematic prototype such
as inadequate ability of gathering light, lack of accurate meteorological data
recording and lower automatic level of observation and data processing were
also pointed out, which need to be improved in subsequent work.

an Adaptive Optics (AO) system, the generation of the Deformable Mirror (DM)
control voltages from the Wavefront Sensor (WFS) measurements is usually
through the multiplication of the wavefront slopes with a predetermined
reconstructor matrix. The ability to access several hundred hard multipliers
and memories concurrently in an FPGA allows performance far beyond that of a
modern CPU or GPU for tasks with a well defined structure such as Adaptive
Optics control. The target of the current project is to generate a signal for a
real time wavefront correction, from the signals coming from a Wavefront
Sensor, wherein the system would be flexible to accommodate all the current
Wavefront Sensing techniques and also the different methods which are used for
wavefront compensation. The system should also accommodate for different data
transmission protocols (like Ethernet, USB, IEEE 1394 etc.) for transmitting
data to and from the FPGA device, thus providing a more flexible platform for
Adaptive Optics control. Preliminary simulation results for the formulation of
the platform, and a design of a fully scalable slope computer is presented.

$G$ consisting of two types of edges: a set $E' \subseteq E$ of $r(n)$
fault-resistant {\em reinforcement} edges, which are assumed to never fail, and
a (larger) set $E(H) \setminus E'$ of $b(n)$ fault-prone {\em backup} edges,
such that subsequent to the failure of a single fault-prone backup edge $e \in
E \setminus E'$, the surviving part of $H$ still contains an BFS spanning tree
for (the surviving part of) $G$, satisfying $dist(s,v,H\setminus \{e\}) \leq

establish the following tradeoff between $b(n)$ and $r(n)$: For every real
$\epsilon \in (0,1]$, if $r(n) = {\tilde\Theta}(n^{1-\epsilon})$, then $b(n) =
{\tilde\Theta}(n^{1+\epsilon})$ is necessary and sufficient.

good recovery of jointly sparse unknown signal vectors from the given multiple
measurement vectors which are different linear combinations of the same known
elementary vectors. This requires careful characterization of robust
complex-valued loss functions as well as Huber's criterion function for the
multivariate sparse regression problem. We devise a greedy algorithm based on
simultaneous normalized iterative hard thresholding (SNIHT) algorithm. Unlike
the conventional SNIHT method, our algorithm, referred to as HUB-SNIHT, is
robust under heavy-tailed non-Gaussian noise conditions, yet has a negligible
performance loss compared to SNIHT under Gaussian noise. Usefulness of the
method is illustrated in source localization application with sensor arrays.

work, we substantially develop further and apply a machinery of continuous

first present an extension of the tomographic possibilities of cMPS by showing
that reconstruction schemes do not need to be based on low-order correlation
functions only, but also on low-order counting probabilities. We show that
fermionic quantum transport settings can be formulated within the cMPS
framework. This allows us to present a reconstruction scheme based on the
measurement of low-order correlation functions that provides access to
quantities that are not directly measurable with present technology. Emblematic
examples are high-order correlations functions and waiting times distributions
(WTD). The latter are of particular interest since they offer insights into
short-time scale physics. We demonstrate the functioning of the method with
actual data, opening up the way to accessing WTD within the quantum regime.

force-constant model from which all possible electron-phonon couplings are

small-diameter CNTs, the mobility strongly depends on chirality, diameter, and

bit-commitment. We discuss how the semidefinite programming formulations of
cheating strategies can be reduced to optimizing a linear combination of
fidelity functions over a polytope. These turn out to be much simpler
semidefinite programs which can be modelled using second-order cone programming
problems. We then use these simplifications to construct their point games as
developed by Kitaev. We also study the classical version of these protocols and
use linear optimization to formulate optimal cheating strategies. We then
construct the point games for the classical protocols as well using the
analysis for the quantum case.
  We discuss the philosophical connections between the classical and quantum
protocols and their point games as viewed from optimization theory. In
particular, we observe an analogy between a spectrum of physical theories (from
classical to quantum) and a spectrum of convex optimization problems (from
linear programming to semidefinite programming, through second-order cone
programming). In this analogy, classical systems correspond to linear
programming problems and the level of quantum features in the system is
correlated to the level of sophistication of the semidefinite programming
models on the optimization side.
  Concerning security analysis, we use the classical point games to prove that
every classical protocol of this type allows exactly one of the parties to
entirely determine the coin-flip. Using the relationships between the quantum
and classical protocols, we show that only ""classical"" protocols can saturate
Kitaev's lower bound for strong coin-flipping. Moreover, if the product of
Alice and Bob's optimal cheating probabilities is 1/2, then one party can cheat
with probability 1. This rules out quantum protocols of this type from
attaining the optimal level of security.

near-infrared (NIR) spectra of the nuclear region of 12 nearby galaxies, mostly
spirals. The features detected in some or all of the galaxies in this sample
are the TiO (0.843 $\mu$m\ and 0.886 $\mu$m), VO (1.048 $\mu$m), CN (1.1
$\mu$m\ and 1.4 $\mu$m), H$\rm _2$O (1.4 $\mu$m\ and 1.9 $\mu$m) and CO (1.6
$\mu$m\ and 2.3 $\mu$m) bands. The C$\rm _2$ (1.17 $\mu$m\ and 1.76 $\mu$m)
bands are generally weak or absent, although C$\rm _2$ (1.76 $\mu$m) may be
weakly present in the mean galaxy spectrum. A deep feature near 0.93 $\mu$m,
likely caused by CN, TiO and/or ZrO, is also detected in all objects. Fitting a
combination of stellar spectra to the mean spectrum shows that the absorption
features are produced by evolved stars: cool giants and supergiant stars in the
early- or thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (E-AGB or TP-AGB) phases.
The high luminosity of TP-AGB stars, and the appearance of VO and ZrO features
in the data, suggest that TP-AGB stars dominate these spectral features.
However, a contribution from other evolved stars is also likely. Comparison
with evolutionary population synthesis models shows that models based on
empirical libraries that predict relatively strong NIR features provide a more
accurate description of the data. However, none of the models tested accurately
reproduces all of the features observed in the spectra. To do so, the models
will need to not only improve the treatment of TP-AGB stars, but also include
good quality spectra of red giant and E-AGB stars. The uninterrupted wavelength
coverage, high S/N, and quantity of features we present here will provide a
benchmark for the next generation of models aiming to explain and predict the
NIR properties of galaxies.

capacity can be reached if one uses a finite number of channels, which is a
topic of practical importance. In this paper, we study the capacity of Gaussian
communication, i.e., employing Gaussian states and Gaussian measurements to
encode and decode information under a single-channel use. We prove that the
optimal capacity of single-channel Gaussian communication is achieved by one of
two well-known protocols, i.e., coherent-state communication or squeezed-state
communication, depending on the energy (number of photons) as well as the
characteristics of the channel. Our result suggests that the coherent-state
scheme known to achieve the ultimate information-theoretic capacity is not a
practically optimal scheme for the case of using a finite number of channels.
We find that overall the squeezed-state communication is optimal in a
small-photon-number regime whereas the coherent-state communication performs
better in a large-photon-number regime.

Model, put stringent bounds on the parameters of our model and measure the
violation of Lorentz invariance. We investigate the canonical quantization of
this non-local model. Second quantization is carried out obtaining a well
defined particle concept. Additionally, we do a counting of the degrees of
freedom associated to the gauge bosons involved in this work, after Spontaneous
Symmetry Breaking has been realized. Violations of Lorentz invariance have been
predicted by several theories of Quantum Gravity \cite{amu}. It is a remarkable
possibility that the low energy effects of Lorentz violation induced by Quantum
Gravity could be contained in the non-local terms of the VSR EW SM.

This paper is devoted to defining urban and rural regions using ideas from
fractals. A basic postulate is that human geographical systems are of
self-similar patterns associated with recursive processes. Then multifractal
geometry can be employed to describe or define the urban and rural terrain with
the level of urbanization. A space-filling index of urban-rural region based on
the generalized correlation dimension is presented to reflect the degree of
geo-spatial utilization in terms of urbanization. The census data of America

follows. First, if the size distribution of cities in a geographical region
cannot be described with the one- or two-parameter model, maybe it can be
characterized by the three-parameter model with a scaling factor and a

meter diameter liquid mirror telescope (LMT) are compared with results of
spectra obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The main purpose of
this comparison is to verify whether observations taken with this novel type of

type of inexpensive telescope that are very useful for astronomical surveys,
particularly surveys in the time domain, and a validation of data taken with an
LMT, by comparison with data from a classical telescope, will validate their
reliability. We start from a published data analysis that classified only 206
of the 18,000 astronomical objects observed with the NODO liquid mirror
telescope as peculiar. A total of 29 of these 206 objects were found in the
SDSS. The reliability of the NODO data can be seen by the results of the
detailed analysis that, in practice, less than 0.3% of the 18,000 spectra were
incorrectly identified as peculiar objects, most probably because they are

  Constraint",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper analyzes the throughput of industrial communication networks under
a secrecy constraint. The proposed scenario is composed by sensors that measure
some relevant information of the plant that is first processed by aggregator
node and then sent to the control unit. The sensor measurements, their
communication with the aggregetor and the information processing are all
assumed perfect. To reach the control unit, the message may travel through
relay nodes, forming a multi-hop, wireless link. At every hop, eavesdropper
nodes attempt to acquire the messages transmitted through the legitimate link.
The communication design problem posed here is how to maximize the multi-hop
throughput from the aggregator to the control unit by finding the best
combination of relay positions (i.e. hop length: short or long) and coding
rates (i.e. high or low spectral efficiency) so that the secrecy constraint is
satisfied. Using a stochastic-geometry approach, we show that the optimal
choice of coding rate depends only on the path- loss exponent and is normally
high while greater number of shorter hops are preferable to smaller number of
longer hops. For the scenarios of interest, we prove that the optimal
throughput subject to the secrecy constraint achieves the unconstrained optimal
performance if a feasible solution exists.

Kepler Mission data set. The light curves of these pulsating stars have been
classified phenomenologically into stars with symmetric light curves and with
asymmetric light curves. In the same effective temperature ranges as the gamma
Dor and SPB stars, there are variable stars with downward light curves that
have been conjectured to be caused by spots. Among these phenomenological
classes of stars, some show `frequency groups' in their amplitude spectra that
have not previously been understood. While it has been recognised that
nonlinear pulsation gives rise to combination frequencies in a Fourier
description of the light curves of these stars, such combination frequencies
have been considered to be a only a minor constituent of the amplitude spectra.
In this paper we unify the Fourier description of the light curves of these
groups of stars, showing that many of them can be understood in terms of only a
few base frequencies, which we attribute to g mode pulsations, and combination
frequencies, where sometimes a very large number of combination frequencies
dominate the amplitude spectra. The frequency groups seen in these stars are
thus tremendously simplified. We show observationally that the combination
frequencies can have amplitudes greater than the base frequency amplitudes, and
we show theoretically how this arises. Thus for some gamma Dor and SPB stars
combination frequencies can have the highest observed amplitudes. Among the B
stars are pulsating Be stars that show emission lines in their spectra from
occasional ejection of material into a circumstellar disk. Our analysis gives
strong support to the understanding of these pulsating Be stars as rapidly
rotating SPB stars, explained entirely by g mode pulsations.

analytic homogeneous space of $\mathcal{U}_J$, and a connected component of
$\mathcal{Q}$. The relationship between $\mathcal{Q}$ and the set $\mathcal{E}$

also theoretically since the late 1980s. Only a few catalogues of them exist.
The bow shocks show emission along all the electromagnetic spectrum, but they
are detected more easily in infrared wavelengths. The release of new and
high-quality infrared data eases the discovery and subsequent study of new
objects. Aims. We search stellar bow-shock candidates associated with nearby
runaway stars, and gather them together with those found elsewhere, to enlarge
the list of the E-BOSS first release. We aim to characterize the bow-shock
candidates and provide a database suitable for statistical studies. We
investigate the low-frequency radio emission at the position of the bow-shock
features, that can contribute to further studies of high-energy emission from
these objects. Methods. We considered samples from different literature sources
and searched for bow-shaped structures associated with stars in the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) images. We looked for each bow-shock candidate
on centimeter radio surveys. Results. We reunited 45 bow-shock candidates and
generated composed WISE images to show the emission in different infrared
bands. Among them there are new sources, previously studied objects, and bow
shocks found serendipitously. Five bow shocks show evidence of radio emission.
Conclusions. Stellar bow shocks constitute an active field with open questions
and enormous amounts of data to be analyzed. Future research at all wavelengths
databases, and use of instruments like Gaia, will provide a more complete
picture of these objects. For instance, infrared spectral energy distributions
can give information about physical parameters of the bow shock matter. In
addition, dedicated high-sensitivity radio observations can help to understand
the radio-$\gamma$ connection.

momentum algebra with the Runge-Lenz vector. In the relativistic hydrogen atom
the accidental symmetry is partially lifted. Due to the Johnson-Lippmann
operator, which commutes with the Dirac Hamiltonian, some degeneracy remains.
When the non-relativistic hydrogen atom is put in a spherical cavity of radius
$R$ with perfectly reflecting Robin boundary conditions, characterized by a
self-adjoint extension parameter $\gamma$, in general the accidental $SO(4)$
symmetry is lifted. However, for $R = (l+1)(l+2) a$ (where $a$ is the Bohr

$\gamma = \infty$ or $\gamma = \frac{2}{R}$. In the relativistic case, we
consider the most general spherically and parity invariant boundary condition,
which is characterized by a self-adjoint extension parameter. In this case, the
remnant accidental symmetry is always lifted in a finite volume. We also
investigate the accidental symmetry in the context of the Pauli equation, which
sheds light on the proper non-relativistic treatment including spin. In that
case, again some degeneracy remains for specific values of $R$ and $\gamma$.

migration and breeding. In our model we accounted for both intra-species
competition (early individuals have a competitive advantage) and a disturbance
which strikes at a random time, killing a fraction $1-p$ of the population.
Disturbances include spells of bad weather, such as freezing or heavily raining
days. It has been shown in Iwasa and Levin (1995), that when $p=0$, then the
ESS is a mixed strategy, where individuals wait for a certain time and
afterwards start arriving (or breeding) every day. We remove the constraint
$p=0$ and show that if $0<p<1$ then the ESS still implies a mixed choice of
times, but strong competition may lead to a massive arrival at the earliest
time possible of a fraction of the population, while the rest will arrive
throughout the whole period during which the disturbance may occur. More
precisely, given $p$, there is a threshold for the competition parameter $a$,
above which massive arrivals occur and below which there is a behaviour as in
Iwasa and Levin (1995). We study the behaviour of the ESS and of the average
fitness of the population, depending on the parameters involved. We also
discuss how the population may be affected by climate change, in two respects:
first, how the ESS should change under the new climate and whether this change
implies an increase of the average fitness; second, which is the impact of the
new climate on a population that still follows the old strategy. We show that,
at least under some conditions, extreme weather events imply a temporary
decrease of the average fitness (thus an increasing mortality). If the
population adapts to the new climate, the survivors may have a larger fitness.

high fidelity polarization imaging with RadioAstron at this wavelength. A

The VLBI data also uncover a complex structure of the nuclear region, with two
prominent features possibly corresponding to the jet base and a strong

lasts only a few decades. The combination of jets and magnetic fields, the key
agents of PNe shaping, could give rise to synchrotron emission, but this has
never been observed before in any PNe, since free-free emission from the
ionized gas is expected to dominate its radio spectrum. In this paper we report
radio continuum observations taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array

2010-2011 show non-thermal emission compatible with synchrotron emission from
electrons accelerated at a shock with spectral index $\alpha \simeq -0.54$.
However, in 2012, the spectral index $\alpha \simeq -0.28$ is no longer
compatible with synchrotron emission in these types of processes. Several
hypothesis are discussed to explain this change. The more plausible ones are
related to the presence of the newly photoionized region in this young PN:
either energy loss of electrons due to Coulomb collisions with the plasma, or
selective suppression of synchrotron radiation due to the Razin effect. We
postulate that the observed flattening of non-thermal radio spectra could be a
hallmark identifying the beginning of the PN phase.

$\gamma_{\phi}$ is given. Based on this, the well-known quintessence cosmology
is studied with an exponential potential $V(\phi)=V_{0}\exp(-\lambda\phi)$.
Given observational data, the current state of universe could be pinpointed in
the phase diagrams, thus making the diagrams more informative. The scaling
solution of quintessence usually is not supposed to give the cosmic
accelerating expansion, but we prove it could educe the transient acceleration.
We also find that the differential equations of system used widely in study of
scalar field are incomplete, and then a numerical method is used to figure out
the range of application.

radioassays and material compositions, and tabulated (\alpha,n) yields and

consideration of additional reactions and materials and examination of the

performed that addresses an increased number of non-statistical uncertainties.
The referred omissions are seen to provide a net increase of 13$\%$ in the

Lipschitz function. Moreover, we also study the local approximation property of
the (p,q)-Kantorovich operators . We show comparisons and some illustrative

q-analogoue of Bernstein-Kantorovich operators, our generalization gives more
flexibility for the convergence of operators to a function.

braneworld with Granda-Oliveros infrared (IR) cutoff, $L=(\alpha \dot{H}+\beta
H^2)^{-1/2}$. With this choice for IR cutoff, we are able to derive evolution
of the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state and the
deceleration parameters, $w$ and $q$, as the functions of the redshift
parameter $z$. As far as we know, most previous models of HDE presented in the
literatures, do not gives analytically $\omega=\omega(z)$ and $q=q(z)$. We plot
the evolution of these parameters versus $z$ and discuss that the results are
compatible with the recent observations. With suitably choosing the parameters,
this model can exhibit a transition from deceleration to the acceleration
around $z\approx 0.6$. Then, we suggest a correspondence between the
quintessence and tachyon scalar fields and HDE in the framework of DGP
braneworld. This correspondence allows us to reconstruct the evolution of the
scalar fields and the scalar potentials. We also investigate stability of the
presented model by calculating the squared sound speed, $v^2_s$, whose sign
determines the stability of the model. Our study shows that $v^2_s$ could be
positive provided the parameters of the model are chosen suitably. In
particular, for $\alpha>1$, $\beta>0$, and $\alpha<1$, $\beta<0$, we have
$v^2_s>0$ during the history of the universe, and so the stable dark energy
dominated universe can be achieved. This is in contrast to the HDE in standard
cosmology, which is unstable against background perturbations and so cannot
lead to a stable dark energy dominated universe.

our daily life; it finds its abode not only with Facebook's auto photo tagging,

automatic face identification systems fail where the effects of aging come into
the picture. Little work exists in the literature on the subject of face
prediction that accounts for aging, which is a vital part of the computer face
recognition systems. In recent years, individual face components' (e.g. eyes,
nose, mouth) features based matching algorithms have emerged, but these
approaches are still not efficient. Therefore, in this work we describe a Face
Prediction Model (FPM), which predicts human face aging or growth related image
variation using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) learning techniques. The FPM captures the facial changes, which
occur with human aging and predicts the facial image with a few years of gap
with an acceptable accuracy of face matching from 76 to 86%.

optimization of the basic robot template to improve performance instead.
Presented here is a novel design description of the Cricket, an advanced robot
with a broader range of physical capabilities than traditional USAR robots. By
incorporating the tracked structure of earlier robots, appreciated for energy
efficiency and robustness, into a multi-limbed walking design, the Cricket
enables the use of advanced locomotion techniques. The ability to climb over
obstacles many times the height of the robot, ascend vertical shafts without
the assistance of a tether, and traverse rough and near vertical terrain
improves the Cricket's capability to successfully locate victims in confined
