that the Consistent Histories formulation of quantum mechanics does not solve
the measurement problem. In order to do so, we argue that satisfactory
solutions to the problem must not only not contain anthropomorphic terms (such
as measurement or observer) at the fundamental level, but also that
applications of the formalism to concrete situations (e.g., measurements)
should not require any input not contained in the description of the situation
at hand at the fundamental level. Our assertion is that the Consistent
Histories formalism does not meet the second criterion. We also argue that the
so-called second measurement problem, i.e., the inability to explain how an
experimental result is related to a property possessed by the measured system
before the measurement took place, is only a pseudo-problem. As a result, we
reject the claim, defended in [2], that the capacity of the Consistent
Histories formalism to solve it should count as an advantage over other
interpretations.

There is an active debate about whether these planets formed in situ or at
greater distances from the central star and migrated to their current position.
It has been shown that part of their observed properties (e.g., eccentricity
distribution) can be reproduced by N-body simulations of in situ formation
starting with a population of protoplanets of high masses and neglecting the
effects of the disk gas. We plan to reassess the in situ formation of close-in
super-Earths through more complete simulations. We performed N-body simulations
of a population of small planetary embryos and planetesimals that include the
effects of disk-planet interactions (e.g., eccentricity damping, type I
migration). In addition, we also consider the accretion of a primitive
atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. We find that planetary embryos grow very
quickly well before the gas dispersal, and thus undergo rapid inward migration,
which means that one cannot neglect the effects of a gas disk when considering
the in-situ formation of close-in super-Earths. Owing to their rapid inward
migration, super-Earths reach a compact configuration near the disk's inner
edge whose distribution of orbital parameters matches the observed close-in
super-Earths population poorly. On the other hand, simulations including
eccentricity damping, but no type I migration, reproduce the observed
distributions better. Including the accretion of an atmosphere does not help
reproduce the bulk architecture of observations. Interestingly, we find that
the massive embryos can migrate inside the disk edge while capturing only a
moderately massive hydrogen/helium atmosphere. By this process they avoid
becoming giant planets. The bulk of close-in super-Earths cannot form in situ,
unless type I migration is suppressed in the entire disk inside 1 AU.

further enhance performance of the system. Simulation results are shown for
uncoded and coded systems to illustrate the performance of the algorithm, which

that combines precoding and scheduling without using power control to exploit
the diversity inherent in a system with large number of users. We show that
this scheme achieves a sum-rate that scales almost logarithmically with the

alignment, which is asymmetric complex signaling restricted to a single complex

a common feature of intermediate-age star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds

multiple generations of stars with an age difference of a few hundred Myrs.
  However, while an eMSTO has been detected in a large number of clusters with
ages between ~1-2 Gyrs, several studies of young clusters in both MCs and in
nearby galaxies do not find any evidence for a prolonged star-formation
history, i.e. for multiple stellar generations. These results have suggested
alternative interpretation of the eMSTOs observed in intermediate-age star
clusters. The eMSTO could be due to stellar rotation mimicking an age spread or
to interacting binaries. In these scenarios, intermediate-age MC clusters would
be simple stellar populations, in close analogy with younger clusters.
  Here we provide the first evidence for an eMSTO in a young stellar cluster.
We exploit multi-band Hubble Space Telescope photometry to study the ~300-Myr
old star cluster NGC1856 in the Large Magellanic Cloud and detected a broadened
MSTO that is consistent with a prolonged star-formation which had a duration of
about 150 Myrs. Below the turn-off, the MS of NGC1856 is split into a red and
blue component, hosting 33+/-5% and 67+/-5% of the total number of MS stars,
respectively. We discuss these findings in the context of
multiple-stellar-generation, stellar-rotation, and interacting-binary

separated events (the horismos relation), we can construct in a natural way the
entire causal structure: causal and chronological relations, causal curves, and
a topology. By imposing a simple additional condition, the structure gains a
definite number of dimensions. This construction works both with continuous and
discrete spacetimes. The dimensionality is obtained also in the discrete case,
so this approach can be suited to prove the fundamental conjecture of causal
sets. Other simple conditions lead to a differentiable manifold with a
conformal structure (the metric up to a scaling factor) as in Lorentzian
manifolds. This structure provides a simple and general reconstruction of the
spacetime in relativistic theories of gravity, which normally requires
topological structure, differential structure, geometric structure (which
decomposes in the conformal structure, giving the causal relations, and the
volume element). Motivations for such a reconstruction come from relativistic
theories of gravity, where the conformal structure is important, from the
problem of singularities, and from Quantum Gravity, where various
discretization methods are pursued, particularly in the causal sets approach.

practice, it is infeasible for anyone but the owner of the network (if
existent) to monitor all nodes at all times. In this work we study the
constrained setting when the observer can only probe a small set of nodes at
each time step to check whether new pieces of information (items) have reached
those nodes.
  We formally define the problem through an infinite time generating process
that places new items in subsets of nodes according to an unknown probability
distribution. Items have an exponentially decaying novelty, modeling their
decreasing value. The observer uses a probing schedule (i.e., a probability
distribution over the set of nodes) to choose, at each time step, a small set
of nodes to check for new items. The goal is to compute a schedule that
minimizes the average novelty of undetected items. We present an algorithm,
WIGGINS, to compute the optimal schedule through convex optimization, and then
show how it can be adapted when the parameters of the problem must be learned
or change over time. We also present a scalable variant of WIGGINS for the
MapReduce framework. The results of our experimental evaluation on real social
networks demonstrate the practicality of our approach.

on the time scale of months-years. However, the most prominent candidate for
the ""hidden"" magnetars --- CXO J1852.6+0040 in Kes 79, -- shows constant
(within error bars) flux. This can be interpreted by lower variable crustal
activity than in typical magnetars. Alternatively, CXO J1852.6+0040 can be in a
high state of variable activity during the whole period of observations. Then
we consider the source 1E161348-5055 in RCW103 as another candidate. Employing
a simple 2D-modeling we argue that properties of the source can be explained by
the crustal activity of the magnetar type. Thus, this object may be
supplemented for the three known candidates for the ""hidden"" magnetars among

has strong overabundances of Fe-peak elements, along with extremely strong
overabundances of rare-earth elements; however, He, Al, and S are
underabundant. This implies that HR 2949 is a chemically peculiar star.
Variability is seen in all photospheric lines, likely due to abundance patches
as seen in many Ap/Bp stars. Longitudinal magnetic field variations measured
from different spectral lines yield different results, likely a consequence of
uneven sampling of the photospheric magnetic field by the abundance patches.
Analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data for both HR 2949 and its
companion star, HR 2948, suggests a revision of HR 2949's fundamental
parameters: in particular, it is somewhat larger, hotter, and more luminous
than previously believed. There is no evidence of optical or ultraviolet
emission originating in HR 2949's magnetosphere, despite its moderately strong
magnetic field and relatively rapid rotation; however, when calculated using
theoretical and empirical boundaries on the initial rotational velocity, the
spindown age is compatible with the stellar age. With the extensive phase

deep, high-resolution photometry of the young (age ~ 300 Myr) star cluster
NGC1856 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We compare the observed colour-magnitude
diagram (CMD), after having applied a correction for differential reddening,
with Monte Carlo simulations of simple stellar populations (SSPs) of various
ages. We find that the main sequence turn-off (MSTO) region is wider than that
derived from the simulation of a single SSP. Using constraints based on the
distribution of stars in the MSTO region and the red clump, we find that the
CMD is best reproduced using a combination of two different SSPs with ages
separated by 80 Myr (0.30 and 0.38 Gyr, respectively). However, we can not
formally exclude that the width of the MSTO could be due to a range of stellar
rotation velocities if the efficiency of rotational mixing is higher than
typically assumed. Using a King-model fit to the surface number density profile
in conjunction with dynamical evolution models, we determine the evolution of
cluster mass and escape velocity from an age of 10 Myr to the present age,
taking into account the possible effects of primordial mass segregation. We
find that the cluster has an escape velocity Vesc ~ 17 km/s at an age of 10
Myr, and it remains high enough during a period of ~ 100 Myr to retain material
ejected by slow winds of first-generation stars. Our results are consistent
with the presence of an age spread in NGC1856, in contradiction to the results
of Bastian & Silva-Villa (2013).

Although it is indistinguishable from cold dark matter in homogeneous,
isotropic cosmology, it encounters phenomenological problems in both
spherically symmetric configurations and cosmological perturbations.
Furthermore, inflationary considerations lead us to expect a tiny value for the
ponderable aether energy density today unless a sourcing effect is added to the

function (SFR DF), UV luminosity function (UV LF), galactic stellar mass
function (GSMF), and specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) of galaxies from the
latest version of the Munich semi-analytic model L-Galaxies. We find a good fit
to both the shape and normalisation of the SFR DF at $z=4-7$, apart from a
slight under-prediction at the low SFR end at $z=4$. Likewise, we find a good
fit to the faint number counts for the observed UV LF; at brighter magnitudes
our predictions lie below the observations, increasingly so at higher
redshifts. At all redshifts and magnitudes, the raw (unattenuated) number
counts for the UV LF lie above the observations. Because of the good agreement
with the SFR we interpret our under-prediction as an over-estimate of the
amount of dust in the model for the brightest galaxies, especially at
high-redshift. While the shape of our GSMF matches that of the observations, we
lie between (conflicting) observations at $z=4-5$, and under-predict at
$z=6-7$. The sSFRs of our model galaxies show the observed trend of increasing
normalisation with redshift, but do not reproduce the observed mass dependence.
Overall, we conclude that the latest version of L-Galaxies, which is tuned to
match observations at $z\leq3$, does a fair job of reproducing the observed
properties of galaxies at $z\geq4$. More work needs to be done on understanding
observational bias at high-redshift, and upon the dust model, before strong
conclusions can be drawn on how to interpret remaining discrepancies between
the model and observations.

measures the correlation between two-point functions of galaxy pairs within
different subvolumes, $\hat{\xi}({\rm r},{\rm r}_L)$, where ${\rm r}_L$ is the
location of a subvolume, and the corresponding mean overdensities,
$\bar{\delta}({\rm r}_L)$. This correlation, which we call the ""integrated
three-point function"", $i\zeta(r)=\langle\hat{\xi}({\rm r},{\rm

short- and one long-wavelength modes, and is generated by nonlinear
gravitational evolution and possibly also by the physics of inflation. The
$i\zeta(r)$ measured from the BOSS data lies within the scatter of those from
the mock galaxy catalogs in redshift space, yielding a ten-percent-level
determination of the amplitude of $i\zeta(r)$. The tree-level perturbation
theory in redshift space predicts how this amplitude depends on the linear and
quadratic nonlinear galaxy bias parameters ($b_1$ and $b_2$), as well as on the
amplitude and linear growth rate of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$ and $f$).
Combining $i\zeta(r)$ with the constraints on $b_1\sigma_8$ and $f\sigma_8$
from the global two-point correlation function and that on $\sigma_8$ from the
weak lensing signal of BOSS galaxies, we measure $b_2=0.41\pm0.41$ (68% C.L.)

over almost the entire visible wavelength range, and maps of the relevant
physical parameters, e.g. extinction, electron density, electron temperature,
line-of-sight velocity of the ionised and neutral gas are shown. In agreement
with previous authors, we find that the pillar tips are being ionised and
photo-evaporated by the massive members of the nearby cluster NGC 6611. They
display a stratified ionisation structure where the emission lines peak in a
descending order according to their ionisation energies. The IFU data allowed
us to analyse the kinematics of the photo-evaporative flow in terms of the
stratified ionisation structure, and we find that, in agreement with
simulations, the photo-evaporative flow is traced by a blueshift in the
position-velocity profile. The gas kinematics and ionisation structure have
allowed us to produce a sketch of the 3D geometry of the Pillars, positioning
the pillars with respect to the ionising cluster stars. We use a novel method
to detect a previously unknown bipolar outflow at the tip of the middle pillar
and suggest that it has an embedded protostar as its driving source.
Furthermore we identify a candidate outflow in the leftmost pillar. With the
derived physical parameters and ionic abundances, we estimate a mass loss rate
due to the photo-evaporative flow of 70 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ which yields an
expected lifetime of approximately 3 Myr.

content of the elliptical galaxy NGC 1407. Our strategy consists of solving the
spherical Jeans equations for three independent dynamical tracers: stars, blue
GCs and red GCs in a self-consistent manner. We adopt a maximum-likelihood
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo fitting technique in the attempt to constrain the
inner slope of the DM density profile (the cusp/core problem), and the stellar
initial mass function (IMF) of the galaxy. We find the inner logarithmic slope
of the DM density profiles to be $\gamma = 0.6\pm0.4$, which is consistent with
either a DM cusp ($\gamma = 1$) or with a DM core $(\gamma = 0)$. Our findings
are consistent with a Salpeter IMF, and marginally consistent with a Kroupa
IMF. We infer tangential orbits for the blue GCs, and radial anisotropy for red
GCs and stars. The modelling results are consistent with the virial
mass--concentration relation predicted by $\Lambda$CDM simulations. The virial
mass of NGC 1407 is $\log$ $M_{\rm vir} = 13.3 \pm 0.2 M_{\odot}$, whereas the
stellar mass is $\log M_* = 11.8 \pm 0.1 M_{\odot}$. The overall uncertainties
on the mass of NGC 1407 are only 5 per cent at the projected stellar effective
radius. We attribute the disagreement between our results and previous X-ray
results to the gas not being in hydrostatic equilibrium in the central regions
of the galaxy. The halo of NGC 1407 is found be DM dominated, with a dynamical
mass-to-light ratio of $M/L=260_{-100} ^{+174} M_{\odot}/L_{\odot, B}$.
However, this value can be larger up to a factor of 3 depending on the assumed

mass-complete sample of 59 cluster galaxies Spitler et al. (2012) and 478 field
galaxies with log(M)>9 using photometric redshifts from the ZFOURGE survey. We
compare the mass-size relation of field and cluster galaxies using measured
galaxy semi-major axis half-light radii ($r_{1/2,maj}$) from CANDELS HST/F160W
imaging. We find consistent mass normalized (log(M)=10.7) sizes for quiescent
field galaxies ($r_{1/2,maj}=1.81\pm0.29$ kpc) and quiescent cluster galaxies
($r_{1/2,maj}=2.17\pm0.63$ kpc). The mass normalized size of star-forming
cluster galaxies ($r_{1/2,maj}=4.00\pm0.26$ kpc ) is 12% larger (KS test
$2.1\sigma$) than star-forming field galaxies ($r_{1/2,maj}=3.57\pm0.10$ kpc).
From the mass-color relation we find that quiescent field galaxies with
9.7<log(M)<10.4 are slightly redder (KS test $3.6\sigma$) than quiescent
cluster galaxies, while cluster and field quiescent galaxies with log(M)>10.4
have consistent colors. We find that star-forming cluster galaxies are on
average 20% redder than star-forming field galaxies at all masses. Furthermore,
we stack galaxy images to measure average radial color profiles as a function
of mass. Negative color gradients are only present for massive star-forming
field and cluster galaxies with log(M)>10.4, the remaining galaxy masses and
types have flat profiles. Our results suggest given the observed differences in
size and color of star-forming field and cluster galaxies, that the environment
has begun to influence/accelerate their evolution. However, the lack of
differences between field and cluster quiescent galaxies indicates that the
environment has not begun to significantly influence their evolution at z~2.

holds key clues not only to their formation but also to the assembly histories
of galaxies. One of the most exciting possibilities is the use of stellar
abundance patterns as ""chemical tags"" to identify stars that were born in the
same molecular cloud. In this paper we assess the prospects of chemical tagging
as a function of several key underlying parameters. We show that in the
fiducial case of $10^4$ distinct cells in chemical space and $10^5-10^6$ stars
in the survey, one can expect to detect $\sim 10^2-10^3$ groups that are $\ge
5\sigma$ overdensities in the chemical space. However, we find that even very
large overdensities in chemical space do not guarantee that the overdensity is
due to a single set of stars from a common birth cloud. In fact, for our
fiducial model parameters, the typical $5\sigma$ overdensity is comprised of
stars from a wide range of clusters with the most dominant cluster contributing
only 25% of the stars. The most important factors limiting the identification
of disrupted clusters via chemical tagging are the number of chemical cells in
the chemical space and the survey sampling rate of the underlying stellar
population. Both of these factors can be improved through strategic
observational plans. While recovering individual clusters through chemical
tagging may prove challenging, we show, in agreement with previous work, that
different CMFs imprint different degrees of clumpiness in chemical space. These
differences provide the opportunity to statistically reconstruct the slope and
high mass cutoff of CMF and its evolution through cosmic time.

corona. Such a corona forms through irradiation of the outer disk by radiation
produced in the inner accretion flow. The same irradiation can produce a strong
outflow from the disk at sufficiently large radii. Outflowing gas has been
recently detected in several X-ray binaries via blue-shifted absorption lines.
However, the causal connection between winds produced by irradiation and the
blue-shifted absorption lines is problematic, particularly in the case of GRO
J1655-40. Observations of this source imply wind densities about two orders of
magnitude higher than theoretically predicted. This discrepancy does not mean
that these `thermal disk-winds' cannot explain blue-shifted absorption in other
systems, nor that they are unimportant as a sink of matter. Motivated by the
inevitability of thermal disk-winds and wealth of data taken with current
observatories such as Chandra, XMM-Newton and Suzaku, as well as the future
AstroH mission, we decided to investigate the requirements to produce very
dense winds. Using physical arguments, hydrodynamical simulations and
absorption line calculations, we found that modification of the heating and
cooling rates by a factor of a few results in an increase of the wind density
of up to an order of magnitude and the wind velocity by a factor of about two.
Therefore, the mass loss rate from the disk can be one, if not even two orders
of magnitude higher than the accretion rate onto the central object. Such a
high mass loss rate is expected to destabilize the disk and perhaps provides a
mechanism for state change.

of nuclear and star-formation activities. Despite being very bright in the
mid-IR band, ~30% of these quasars are not detected in the extremely deep 2 Ms

of the detected sources reveals that the majority (~67%) are obscured by column
densities N$_H$>10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$; this fraction reaches ~80% when including
the X-ray undetected sources (9 out of 33), which are likely to be the most
heavily-obscured, CT quasars. We constrain the fraction of CT quasars in our

host galaxies in terms of star-formation rates (SFRs) and morphological
distortions, as a sign of galaxy mergers/interactions, we do not find any

other hand, there is tentative evidence that the most heavily-obscured quasars
have, on average, more disturbed morphologies than the
unobscured/moderately-obscured quasar hosts, which preferentially live in
undisturbed systems. However, the fraction of quasars with disturbed morphology

galaxy mergers. ""Disky pseudobulges"" are diskier and more actively star-forming
(except in S0s) than are ellipticals. Theys are products of the slow
(""secular"") evolution of galaxy disks: bars and other nonaxisymmetries move
disk gas toward the center, where it starbursts and builds relatively flat,
rapidly rotating components. This secular evolution is a new area of galaxy
evolution work that complements hierarchical clustering. 2 - Disks of
high-redshift galaxies are unstable to the formation of mass clumps that sink
to the center and merge - an alternative channel for the formation of classical
bulges. I review successes and unsolved problems in the formation of
bulges+ellipticals and their coevolution (or not) with supermassive black
holes. I present an observer's perspective on simulations of dark matter galaxy
formation including baryons. I review how our picture of the quenching of star
formation is becoming general and secure at redshifts z < 1. The biggest
challenge is to produce realistic bulges+ellipticals and disks that overlap
over a factor of 10**3 in mass but that differ from each other as observed over
that whole range. Second, how does hierarchical clustering make so many giant,
bulgeless galaxies in field but not cluster environments? I argue that we rely
too much on AGN and star-formation feedback to solve these challenges.

source and background, we find that the hard (2-10 keV) flux of the putative
AGN has decreased by approximately an order of magnitude between the 2001
Chandra observation and exposures with XMM-Newton in 2004 and 2011. The
observed variability confirms that the emission is due to a single source. It
is unlikely that the variable flux is due to a supernova or ultraluminous X-ray
source, based on the observed long-term behavior of the X-ray and radio
emission, while the observed X-ray variability is consistent with the behavior
of well-studied AGNs.

independent of the DM halo velocity distribution have been developed which
present results in the $v_{min}-\tilde{g}$ plane, but these in turn require an
assumption on the dark matter mass. Here we present an extension of these
halo-independent methods for dark matter direct detection which does not
require a fiducial choice of the dark matter mass. With a change of variables
from $v_{min}$ to nuclear recoil momentum ($p_R$), the full halo-independent
content of an experimental result for any dark matter mass can be condensed
into a single plot as a function of a new halo integral variable, which we call
$\tilde{h}(p_R)$. The entire family of conventional halo-independent
$\tilde{g}(v_{min})$ plots for all DM masses are directly found from the single
$\tilde{h}(p_R)$ plot through a simple rescaling of axes. By considering
results in $\tilde{h}(p_R)$ space, one can determine if two experiments are
inconsistent for all masses and all physically possible halos, or for what
range of dark matter masses the results are inconsistent for all halos, without
the necessity of multiple $\tilde{g}(v_{min})$ plots for different DM masses.
We conduct a sample analysis comparing the CDMS II Si events to the null
results from LUX, XENON10, and SuperCDMS using our method and discuss how the

accurately reproduced with a cloudless model if vertical mixing and NH3
quenching are taken into account. T dwarf spectra still have some reddening in
e.g. J - H compared to cloudless models. This reddening can be reproduced by
slightly reducing the temperature gradient in the atmosphere. We propose that
this reduction of the stabilizing temperature gradient in these layers, leading
to cooler structures, is due to the onset of fingering convection, triggered by
the destabilizing impact of condensation of very thin dust.

nucleosynthesis is difficult to probe and largely unconstrained. This ignorance
profoundly limits our understanding of dark matter: we cannot calculate its
thermal relic abundance without knowing when the Universe became radiation
dominated. Fortunately, small-scale density perturbations provide a probe of
the early Universe that could break this degeneracy. If dark matter is a
thermal relic, density perturbations that enter the horizon during an early
matter-dominated era grow linearly with the scale factor prior to reheating.
The resulting abundance of substructure boosts the annihilation rate by several
orders of magnitude, which can compensate for the smaller annihilation cross
sections that are required to generate the observed dark matter density in
these scenarios. In particular, thermal relics with masses less than a TeV that
thermally and kinetically decouple prior to reheating may already be ruled out
by Fermi-LAT observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Although these
constraints are subject to uncertainties regarding the internal structure of
the microhalos that form from the enhanced perturbations, they open up the
possibility of using gamma-ray observations to learn about the reheating of the
Universe.

collapsing extra-planar gas clouds at the disk-halo interface, possibly as a

images taken with the \texit{Hubble Space Telescope} as part of the
Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT). We fit the color-magnitude
diagrams in ~9000 regions that are ~100 pc $\times$ 100 pc in projected size,
covering a 0.5 square degree area (~380 kpc$^2$, deprojected) in the NE
quadrant of M31. We show that the SFHs vary significantly on these small
spatial scales but that there are also coherent galaxy-wide fluctuations in the
SFH back to ~500 Myr, most notably in M31's 10-kpc star-forming ring. We find
that the 10-kpc ring is at least 400 Myr old, showing ongoing star formation
over the past ~500 Myr. This indicates the presence of molecular gas in the
ring over at least 2 dynamical times at this radius. We also find that the
ring's position is constant throughout this time, and is stationary at the
level of 1 km/s, although there is evidence for broadening of the ring due to
diffusion of stars into the disk. Based on existing models of M31's ring
features, the lack of evolution in the ring's position makes a purely
collisional ring origin highly unlikely. We find that the global SFR has been
fairly constant over the last ~500 Myr, though it does show a small increase at
50 Myr that is 1.3 times the average SFR over the past 100 Myr. During the last
~500 Myr, ~60% of all SF occurs in the 10-kpc ring. Finally, we find that in
the past 100 Myr, the average SFR over the PHAT survey area is $0.28\pm0.03$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with an average deprojected intensity of $7.3 \times
10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, which yields a total SFR of ~0.7
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ when extrapolated to the entire area of M31's disk. This
SFR is consistent with measurements from broadband estimates. [abridged]

mission data, we present a significant detection of baryons participating in
large-scale bulk flows around central galaxies (CGs) at redshift $z\approx
0.1$. We estimate the pairwise momentum of the kSZ temperature fluctuations at
the positions of the CGC (Central Galaxy Catalogue) samples extracted from
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (DR7) data. For the foreground-cleaned maps, we find
$1.8$-$2.5\sigma$ detections of the kSZ signal, which are consistent with the
kSZ evidence found in individual Planck raw frequency maps, although lower than
found in the WMAP-9yr W band ($3.3\sigma$). We further reconstruct the peculiar
velocity field from the CG density field, and compute for the first time the
cross-correlation function between kSZ temperature fluctuations and estimates
of CG radial peculiar velocities. This correlation function yields a
$3.0$-$3.7$$\sigma$ detection of the peculiar motion of extended gas on Mpc
scales, in flows correlated up to distances of 80-100 $h^{-1}$ Mpc. Both the
pairwise momentum estimates and kSZ temperature-velocity field correlation find
evidence for kSZ signatures out to apertures of 8 arcmin and beyond,
corresponding to a physical radius of $> 1$ Mpc, more than twice the mean
virial radius of halos. This is consistent with the predictions from hydro
simulations that most of the baryons are outside the virialized halos. We fit a
simple model, in which the temperature-velocity cross-correlation is
proportional to the signal seen in a semi-analytic model built upon N-body
simulations, and interpret the proportionality constant as an ""effective""
optical depth to Thomson scattering. We find $\tau_T=(1.4\pm0.5)\times
10^{-4}$; the simplest interpretation of this measurement is that much of the
gas is in a diffuse phase, which contributes little signal to X-ray or thermal
SZ observations.

the holonomy and the issue of confinement. We calculate the free energy as a
function of the holonomy and the dyon densities, using standard Metropolis
Monte Carlo and integration over parameter methods. We observe that as the
temperature decreases and the dyon density grows, its minimum indeed moves from
small holonomy to the value corresponding to confinement. We then report
various parameters of the self-consistent ensembles as a function of

bolometric luminosities of $L_\mathrm{bol}\sim10^2 - 10^3$ $L_\odot$. The maps
cover spatial scales of $\sim 10^4$ AU in several CO and H$_2$O lines located

about $100$ K lower than in high-mass protostars. Since the uncertainties in

intermediate and high-mass protostars, we cannot conclude whether the change in
rotational temperature occurs at a specific luminosity, or whether the change
is more gradual from low- to high-mass YSOs. Conclusions: Molecular excitation
in intermediate-mass protostars is comparable to the central $10^{3}$ AU of
low-mass protostars and consistent within the uncertainties with the high-mass
protostars probed at $3\cdot10^{3}$ AU scales, suggesting similar shock
conditions in all those sources.

of nuclear burning to the surface. Most of the carbon in the Universe is
believed to originate from stars with masses up to a few solar masses. Although
there is a chemical dichotomy between oxygen-rich and carbon-rich evolved
stars, the dredge-up itself has never been directly observed. In the last three
decades, however, a few stars have been shown to display both carbon- and
oxygen-rich material in their circumstellar envelopes. Two models have been
proposed to explain this dual chemistry: one postulates that a recent dredge-up
of carbon produced by nucleosynthesis inside the star during the Asymptotic
Giant Branch changed the surface chemistry of the star. The other model
postulates that oxygen-rich material exists in stable keplerian rotation around
the central star. The two models make contradictory, testable, predictions on
the location of the oxygen-rich material, either located further from the star
than the carbon-rich gas, or very close to the star in a stable disk. Using the
Faint Object InfraRed CAmera (FORCAST) instrument on board the Stratospheric
Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) Telescope, we obtained images of the
carbon-rich planetary nebula (PN) BD+30 3639 which trace both carbon-rich
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygen-rich silicate dust. With the
superior spectral coverage of SOFIA, and using a 3D photoionisation and dust
radiative transfer model we prove that the O-rich material is distributed in a
shell in the outer parts of the nebula, while the C-rich material is located in
the inner parts of the nebula. These observations combined with the model,
suggest a recent change in stellar surface composition for the double chemistry
in this object. This is evidence for dredge-up occurring ~1000yr ago.

transport in ultra-narrow armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) using
non-equilibrium Greens function (NEGF) simulation techniques. We specifically
focus on how different parts of the phonon spectrum are influenced by
geometrical confinement and line edge roughness. With the introduction of line
edge roughness, the phonon transmission is reduced, but non-uniformly
throughout the spectrum. We identify four distinct behaviors within the phonon
spectrum in the presence of disorder: i) the low-energy, low-wavevector
acoustic branches have very long mean-free-paths and are affected the least by
edge disorder, even in the case of ultra-narrow W=1nm wide GNRs; ii) energy
regions that consist of a dense population of relatively flat phonon modes
(including the optical branches) are also not significantly affected, except in
the case of the ultranarrow W=1nm GNRs, in which case the transmission is
reduced because of band mismatch along the phonon transport path; iii)
quasi-acoustic bands that lie within the intermediate region of the spectrum
are strongly affected by disorder as this part of the spectrum is depleted of
propagating phonon modes upon both confinement and disorder especially as the
channel length increases; iv) the strongest reduction in phonon transmission is
observed in energy regions that are composed of a small density of phonon
modes, in which case roughness can introduce transport gaps that greatly
increase with channel length. We show that in GNRs of widths as small as W=3nm,
under moderate roughness, both the low-energy acoustic modes and dense regions
of optical modes can retain semi-ballistic transport properties, even for
channel lengths up to L=1 um. Modes in the sparse regions of the spectrum fall
into the localization regime even for channel lengths as short as 10s of
nanometers.

role in determining the optical properties of excited excitons, especially the

and analysis of emission spectra from artificial atoms or quantum dots coupled
to structured photon reservoirs and acoustic phonons, when excited with
incoherent pump fields. As specific examples of structured reservoirs, we chose
a Lorentzian cavity and a coupled cavity waveguide, which are of current
experimental interest. For the case of optical cavities, we directly compare
and contrast the spectra from three distinct theoretical approaches to treat
electron-phonon coupling, including a Markovian polaron master equation, a
non-Markovian phonon correlation expansion technique and a semiclassical linear
susceptibility approach, and we point out the limitations of these models. For
the cavity-QED polaron master equation, we give closed form analytical
solutions to the phonon-assisted scattering rates in the weak excitation
approximation, fully accounting for temperature, cavity-exciton detuning and
cavity dot coupling. We show explicitly why the semiclassical linear
susceptibility approach fails to correctly account for phonon-mediated cavity
feeding. For weakly coupled cavities, we calculate the optical spectra using a
more general reservoir approach and explain its differences from the above
approaches in the low Q limit of a Lorentzian cavity. We subsequently use this
general reservoir to calculate the emission spectra from quantum dots coupled
to slow-light photonic crystal waveguides, which demonstrate a number of
striking photon-phonon coupling effects. Our quantum theory can be applied to a
wide range of photonic structures including photonic molecules and

galaxies is a powerful tool to probe the site of r-process since their
small-mass scale can sort out individual events producing r-process elements. A
merger of binary neutron stars is a promising candidate of this site. In faint,
or less massive dSph galaxies such as the Draco, a few binary neutron star
mergers are expected to have occurred at most over the whole past. We have
measured chemical abundances including Eu and Ba of three red giants in the
Draco dSph by Subaru/HDS observation. The Eu detection for one star with
[Fe/H]=-1.45 confirms a broadly constant [Eu/H] of ~-1.3 for stars with
[Fe/H]>-2. This feature is shared by other dSphs with similar masses, i.e., the
Sculptor and the Carina, and suggests that neutron star merger is the origin of
r-process elements in terms of its rarity. In addition, two very metal-poor
stars with [Fe/H]=-2.12 and -2.51 are found to exhibit very low Eu abundances
such as [Eu/H]<-2 with an implication of a sudden increase of Eu abundance by
more than 0.7 dex at [Fe/H] ~ -2.2 in the Draco dSph. In addition, the
detection of Ba abundances for these stars suggests that the r-process
enrichment initiated no later than the time when only a few % of stars in the
present-day Draco dSph was formed. Though an identification of the origin of an
early Eu production inside the Draco dSph should be awaited until more
abundance data of stars with [Fe/H]<-2 in the Draco as well as other faint
dSphs become available, the implied early emergence of Eu production event
might be reconciled with the presence of extremely metal-poor stars enriched by
r-process elements in the Galactic halo.

  Assuming that the MIMO channels are subject to Rayleigh fading, a simple and
compact closed-form outage probability expression has been derived. The key
assumption to derive this result is that the mutual information of each channel
could be well approximated by a Gaussian random variable. In order to obtain
the resultant outage probability, a new excellent accurate approximation has
been obtained for the sum of Wishart distributed complex random matrices.
  Numerical Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to validate our result.
These simulations have shown that, for low and medium interference regime, FD

increases, HD mode can outperforms FD mode.

[CII] has two emission peaks, one associated with the compressed WIM and the
other the molecular gas PDRs. When represented as a cut across the inner to

an audience inherently multicultural by the nature of scientific collaboration.
English is expected to be the lingua franca bridging the communication and

little research has been done to support this assumption. In this paper we
analyzed how integrated language communities are by analyzing the scholars'
tweets used in 26 Computer Science conferences over a time span of five years.
We found that although English is the most popular language used to tweet
during conferences, a significant proportion of people also tweet in other
languages. In addition, people who tweet solely in English interact mostly
within the same group (English monolinguals), while people who speak other
languages tend to show a more diverse interaction with other lingua groups.
Finally, we also found that the people who interact with other Twitter users
show a more diverse language distribution, while people who do not interact
mostly post tweets in a single language. These results suggest a relation
between the number of languages a user speaks, which can affect the interaction
dynamics of online communities.

relaxation of interacting many-particle quantum systems. We investigate this
physics by studying the center-of-mass oscillations of two species of fermionic
ultracold atoms in a harmonic trap. If their trap frequencies are equal, a
dynamical symmetry (spectrum generating algebra), closely related to Kohn's
theorem, prohibits the relaxation of center-of-mass oscillations. A small
detuning $\delta\omega$ of the trap frequencies for the two species breaks the
dynamical symmetry and ultimately leads to a damping of dipole oscillations
driven by inter-species interactions. Using memory-matrix methods, we calculate
the relaxation as a function of frequency difference, particle number,
temperature, and strength of inter-species interactions. When interactions
dominate, there is almost perfect drag between the two species and the
dynamical symmetry is approximately restored. The drag can either arise from
Hartree potentials or from friction. In the latter case (hydrodynamic limit),
the center-of-mass oscillations decay with a tiny rate, $1/\tau \propto
(\delta\omega)^2/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is a single particle scattering rate.

$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry. Therefore, the interaction of charge order and
quenched disorder due to potential scattering, can, in principle, be treated as
a random field Ising model. A numerical analysis of the ground state of such a
random field Ising model reveals local, glassy dynamics in both $2D$ and $3D$.
The glassy dynamics are treated as a heat bath which couple to the itinerant
electrons, leading to an unusual electronic non-Fermi liquid. If the dynamics
are strong enough, the electron spectral function has no quasiparticle peak and
the effective mass diverges at the Fermi surface, precluding quantum
oscillations. In contrast to charge density, $d$-density wave order (reflecting
staggered circulating currents) does not directly couple to potential disorder,
allowing it to support quantum oscillations. At fourth order in Landau theory,
there is a term consisting of the square of the $d$-density wave order
parameter, and the square of the charge order. This coupling could induce
parasitic charge order, which may be weak enough for the Fermi liquid behavior
to remain uncorrupted. Here, we argue that this distinction must be made clear,
as one interprets quantum oscillations in cuprates.

  the previous version (which was 77 pages) is completely rewritten",,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work is a mathematician's attempt to understand intuitionistic logic. It
can be read in two ways: as a research paper interspersed with lengthy
digressions into rethinking of standard material; or as an elementary (but
highly unconventional) introduction to first-order intuitionistic logic. For
the latter purpose, no training in formal logic is required, but a modest
literacy in mathematics, such as topological spaces and posets, is assumed.
  The main theme of this work is the search for a formal semantics adequate to
Kolmogorov's informal interpretation of intuitionistic logic (whose simplest
part is more or less the same as the so-called BHK interpretation). This search
goes beyond the usual model theory, based on Tarski's notion of semantic
consequence, and beyond the usual formalism of first-order logic, based on
schemata. Thus we study formal semantics of a simplified version of Paulson's
meta-logic, used in the Isabelle prover.
  By interpreting the meta-logical connectives and quantifiers constructively,
we get a generalized model theory, which covers, in particular,
realizability-type interpretations of intuitionistic logic. On the other hand,
by analyzing Kolmogorov's notion of semantic consequence (which is an
alternative to Tarski's standard notion), we get an alternative model theory.
By using an extension of the meta-logic, we further get a generalized
alternative model theory, which suffices to formalize Kolmogorov's semantics.
  On the other hand, we also formulate a modification of Kolmogorov's
interpretation, which is compatible with the usual, Tarski-style model theory.
Namely, it can be formalized by means of sheaf-valued models, which turn out to
be a special case of Palmgren's categorical models; intuitionistic logic is
complete with respect to this semantics.

known to be biased. This problem can be remedied by using the two-stage least
squares (TSLS) estimator, based on the availability of valid instrumental
variables (IVs). This reduction in bias, however, is offset by an increase in
variance. Under standard assumptions, the OLS has indeed a larger bias than the
TSLS estimator; and moreover, one can prove that the sample variance of the OLS
estimator is no greater than the one of the TSLS. Therefore, it is natural to
ask whether one could combine the desirable properties of the OLS and TSLS
estimators. Such a trade-off can be achieved through a convex combination of
these two estimators, thereby producing our proposed convex least squares (CLS)
estimator. The relative contribution of the OLS and TSLS estimators is here
chosen to minimize a sample estimate of the mean squared error (MSE) of their
convex combination. This proportion parameter is proved to be unique, whenever
the OLS and TSLS differ in MSEs. Remarkably, we show that this proportion
parameter can be estimated from the data, and that the resulting CLS estimator
is consistent. We also show how the CLS framework can incorporate other
asymptotically unbiased estimators, such as the jackknife IV estimator (JIVE).
The finite-sample properties of the CLS estimator are investigated using Monte
Carlo simulations, in which we independently vary the amount of confounding and
the strength of the instrument. Overall, the CLS estimator is found to
outperform the TSLS estimator in terms of MSE. The method is also applied to a
classic data set from econometrics, which models the financial return to
education.

new Hubble Space Telescope imaging and VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy of

one of these is spatially offset from its stars. The best-constrained offset is
1.62+/-0.48kpc, where the 68% confidence limit includes both statistical error
and systematic biases in mass modelling. Such offsets are not seen in field
galaxies, but are predicted during the long infall to a cluster, if dark matter

separation, it is difficult to definitively rule out astrophysical effects
operating exclusively in dense cluster core environments - but if interpreted

a fundamental role in combinatorial optimization, algorithmic game theory and

random examples, we consider the question of how well such functions can be
approximated by low-degree polynomials in $\ell_2$ norm over the uniform
distribution. This question is equivalent to understanding of the concentration
of Fourier weight on low-degree coefficients, a central concept in Fourier
analysis. We show that
  1. For any submodular function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow [0,1]$, there is a
polynomial of degree $O(\log (1/\epsilon) / \epsilon^{4/5})$ approximating $f$
within $\epsilon$ in $\ell_2$, and there is a submodular function that requires
degree $\Omega(1/\epsilon^{4/5})$.
  2. For any XOS function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow [0,1]$, there is a
polynomial of degree $O(1/\epsilon)$ and there exists an XOS function that
requires degree $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$.
  This improves on previous approaches that all showed an upper bound of
$O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for submodular and XOS functions. The best previous lower
bound was $\Omega(1/\epsilon^{2/3})$ for monotone submodular functions. Our
techniques reveal new structural properties of submodular and XOS functions and
the upper bounds lead to nearly optimal PAC learning algorithms for these

geometric phases, it is a conventional wisdom that quantum systems beyond two
levels are required, which is extremely difficult to fulfil for superconducting
qubits, appearing to be a main reason why only single qubit gates was
implemented in a recent experiment [A. A. Abdumalikov Jr \emph{et al}., Nature
496, 482 (2013)]. Here we propose to realize non-adiabatic holonomic quantum
computation in decoherence-free subspace on circuit QED, where one can use only
the two levels in transmon qubits, a usual interaction, and a minimal resource
for the decoherence-free subspace encoding. In particular, our scheme not only
overcomes the difficulties encountered in previous studies, but also can still
achieve considerably large effective coupling strength, such that high fidelity
quantum gates can be achieved. Therefore, the present scheme makes it very
promising way to realize robust holonomic quantum computation with
superconducting circuits.

number (the nondimensional shear stress at the top of the bed) and particle
Reynolds number (the ratio of particle inertia to viscous damping), we explore
how variations of the fluid flow rate, particle inertia, and fluid viscosity
affect the onset and cessation of bed motion. For low to moderate particle
Reynolds numbers, a critical boundary separates mobile and static states.
Transition times between these states diverge as this boundary is approached
both from above and below. At high particle Reynolds number, inertial effects
become dominant, and particle motion can be sustained well below flow rates at
which mobilization of a static bed occurs. We also find that the onset of bed
motion (for both low and high particle Reynolds numbers) is described by
Weibullian weakest-link statistics, and thus is crucially dependent on the
packing structure of the granular bed, even deep beneath the surface.

This direction is opposite to mean surface winds simulated by Global Climate
Models (GCMs), which are oriented westward at these latitudes, similar to trade
winds on Earth. Different hypotheses have been proposed to address this
apparent contradiction, involving Saturn's gravitational tides, large scale
topography or wind statistics, but none of them can explain a global eastward
dune propagation in the equatorial band. Here we analyse the impact of
equinoctial tropical methane storms developing in the superrotating atmosphere
(i.e. the eastward winds at high altitude) on Titan's dune orientation. Using
mesoscale simulations of convective methane clouds with a GCM wind profile
featuring superrotation, we show that Titan's storms should produce fast
eastward gust fronts above the surface. Such gusts dominate the aeolian
transport, allowing dunes to extend eastward. This analysis therefore suggests
a coupling between superrotation, tropical methane storms and dune formation on
Titan. Furthermore, together with GCM predictions and analogies to some
terrestrial dune fields, this work provides a general framework explaining
several major features of Titan's dunes: linear shape, eastward propagation and
poleward divergence, and implies an equatorial origin of Titan's dune sand.

space and the direct sum of the centers of the group algebra of the symmetric

elements gives $\tau$-functions of hypergeometric type, for which the expansion
over products of Schur functions is diagonal, with coefficients of {\em content

$S_n$ group algebra is determined by forming symmetric functions
multiplicatively from a weight generating function $G(z)$ and evaluating on the
Jucys-Murphy elements of the group algebra. The resulting central elements act
diagonally on the basis of orthogonal idempotents and the eigenvalues
$r^{G(z)}_\lambda$ are the {\em content product} coefficients appearing in the
double Schur function expansion. Both the geometrical meaning of weighted
Hurwitz numbers, as weighted sums over $n$-sheeted branched coverings, and the
combinatorial one, as weighted enumeration of paths in the Cayley graph of

an image is first encoded as a vector of hand-engineering visual features,

In this paper, we propose a deep architecture for supervised hashing, in which
images are mapped into binary codes via carefully designed deep neural
networks. The pipeline of the proposed deep architecture consists of three
building blocks: 1) a sub-network with a stack of convolution layers to produce
the effective intermediate image features; 2) a divide-and-encode module to
divide the intermediate image features into multiple branches, each encoded
into one hash bit; and 3) a triplet ranking loss designed to characterize that

simultaneous feature learning and hash coding pipeline brings substantial

considered in the paper are based on fully distributed consensus algorithms,
where all of the nodes exchange information only with their neighbors in the
absence of a fusion center. In such networks, we characterize the negative
effect of Byzantines on the steady-state and transient detection performance of
the conventional consensus based detection algorithms. To address this issue,
we study the problem from the network designer's perspective. More
specifically, we first propose a distributed weighted average consensus
algorithm that is robust to Byzantine attacks. We show that, under reasonable
assumptions, the global test statistic for detection can be computed locally at
each node using our proposed consensus algorithm. We exploit the statistical
distribution of the nodes' data to devise techniques for mitigating the
influence of data falsifying Byzantines on the distributed detection system.
Since some parameters of the statistical distribution of the nodes' data might
not be known a priori, we propose learning based techniques to enable an
adaptive design of the local fusion or update rules.

tensor decomposition, and study the SOS-rank of SOS tensor decomposition. We
first show that several classes of even order symmetric structured tensors
available in the literature have SOS tensor decomposition. These include
positive Cauchy tensors, weakly diagonally dominated tensors, $B_0$-tensors,
double $B$-tensors, quasi-double $B_0$-tensors, $MB_0$-tensors, $H$-tensors,
absolute tensors of positive semi-definite $Z$-tensors and extended
$Z$-tensors. We also examine the SOS-rank of SOS tensor decomposition and the
SOS-width for SOS tensor cones. The SOS-rank provides the minimal number of
squares in the SOS tensor decomposition, and, for a given SOS tensor cone, its
SOS-width is the maximum possible SOS-rank for all the tensors in this cone. We
first deduce an upper bound for general tensors that have SOS decomposition and
the SOS-width for general SOS tensor cone using the known results in the
literature of polynomial theory. Then, we provide an explicit sharper estimate
for the SOS-rank of SOS tensor decomposition with bounded exponent and identify
the SOS-width for the tensor cone consisting of all tensors with bounded
exponent that have SOS decompositions. Finally, as applications, we show how
the SOS tensor decomposition can be used to compute the minimum $H$-eigenvalue
of an even order symmetric extended $Z$-tensor and test the positive
definiteness of an associated multivariate form. Numerical experiments are also
provided to show the efficiency of the proposed numerical methods ranging from
small size to large size numerical examples.

They recursively partition the feature space into disjoint sub-regions until
each sub-region becomes homogeneous with respect to a particular class. The
basic Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm partitions the
feature space using axis parallel splits. When the true decision boundaries are
not aligned with the feature axes, this approach can produce a complicated
boundary structure. Oblique decision trees use oblique decision boundaries to
potentially simplify the boundary structure. The major limitation of this
approach is that the tree induction algorithm is computationally expensive. In
this article we present a new decision tree algorithm, called HHCART. The
method utilizes a series of Householder matrices to reflect the training data
at each node during the tree construction. Each reflection is based on the
directions of the eigenvectors from each classes' covariance matrix.
Considering axis parallel splits in the reflected training data provides an
efficient way of finding oblique splits in the unreflected training data.
Experimental results show that the accuracy and size of the HHCART trees are
comparable with some benchmark methods in the literature. The appealing feature
of HHCART is that it can handle both qualitative and quantitative features in
the same oblique split.

nanometer range, this device can exhibit superior performances in terms of (i)
high modulation depth, (ii) ultra-broadband performance, (iii) ultra-low

to V838 Mon. Our observations were obtained in 2009 and 2012, i.e. months and
years after the eruption of V1309 Sco, and illustrate severe changes in the
remnant, mainly in its circumstellar surroundings. In addition to atomic gas
observed in earlier epochs, we identified molecular bands of TiO, VO, H$_2$O,
ScO, AlO, and CrO. The infrared bands of CrO we analyse are the first
astronomical identification of the features. Over the whole period covered by
our data, the remnant was associated with a cool ($\lesssim$1000 K) outflow
with a terminal velocity of about 200 km/s. Signatures of warmer atomic gas,
likely to be still dissipating the energy of the 2008 outburst, dramatically
decreased their brightness between 2009 and 2012. In addition, the source of
optical continuum disappeared sometime before 2012, likely owing to the
formation of new dust. The final stage of V1309 Sco's evolution captured by our
spectra is an object remarkably similar to an older red transient, V4332 Sgr.
In addition to providing a detailed view on the settling of the eruptive
object, the observations presented here reinforce the conclusion that all the
Galactic red transients are a manifestation of the same phenomenon, i.e. a
stellar merger. The late spectra of V1309 Sco also suggest peculiarities in the
chemical composition of the remnant, which still need to be explored.

degradation is caused by the relative phase offset between received signals

investigates an NCMA system with multiple receive antennas at the access point

designs on software-defined radio. Our experimental results show that the
throughput of QPSK MIMO-NCMA is double that of both BPSK NCMA and QPSK MUD at

We recently identified a correction for C IV $\lambda$1549-based scaling
relationships used to estimate quasar black hole masses that relies on the
continuum-subtracted peak flux ratio of the ultraviolet emission-line blend Si
IV + OIV] (the $\lambda$1400 feature) to that of C IV. This parameter
correlates with the suite of associated quasar spectral properties collectively
known as ""Eigenvector 1"" (EV1). Here we use a sample of 85 quasars with
quasi-simultaneous optical-ultraviolet spectrophotometry to demonstrate how
biases in the average EV1 properties can create systematic biases in C IV-based
black hole mass scaling relationships. This effect results in nearly an order
of magnitude moving from objects with small $<$ peak $\lambda$1400/C IV $>$,
which have overestimated black hole masses, to objects with large $<$ peak
$\lambda1400$/C IV $>$, which have underestimated values. We show that existing
reverberation-mapped samples of quasars with ultraviolet spectra -- used to
calibrate C IV-based scaling relationships -- have significant EV1 biases that
result in predictions of black hole masses nearly 50\% too high for the average
quasar. We offer corrections and suggestions to account for this bias.

$\mbb C^2$ that are fibered over a compact metric space $M$. The problem
reduces to understanding the dynamical behavior of the composition of a
pseudo-random sequence of H\'{e}non mappings. In analogy with the dynamics of
the iterates of a single H\'{e}non map, it is possible to construct fibered
Green's functions that satisfy suitable invariance properties and the
corresponding stable and unstable currents. This analogy is carried forth in
two ways: it is shown that the successive pullbacks of a suitable current by
the skew H\'{e}non maps converges to a multiple of the fibered stable current
and secondly, this convergence result is used to obtain a lower bound on the
topological entropy of the skew product in some special cases. The other class
of maps that are studied are skew products of holomorphic endomorphisms of
$\mbb P^k$ that are again fibered over a compact base. We define the fibered
basins of attraction and show that they are pseudoconvex and Kobayashi
hyperbolic.

planet migration in viscous discs affected by photoevaporation driven by either
pure EUV or soft X-ray radiation (XEUV). We show that the final exoplanet
distributions are strongly dependant on the choice of the photoevaporation
model. In particular, we find that XEUV is more efficient than pure EUV
radiation at parking planets at approximately 1-2 AU distance from their
central star, hence roughly reproducing the observed peak in the exoplanets
semi-major axis distributions. We note however that a more quantitative
comparison with the observations is hindered by the oversimplified treatment of
planetary accretion, which severely affects migration rates. For this reason,
caution should be used when using these models to constrain details of disc
clearing and/or migration from the observations. Nevertheless our results
indicate that disc dispersal by photoevaporation may be the main driver of the
features in the exoplanets semi-major axis distribution observed by recent

recent years. In this Letter, we demonstrate that in addition to generating
thermal pressure, thermal atoms enhance the repulsiveness of the

effect and further stabilize the Bose gases. Consequently, we find that, as a
precursor of instability, the compressibility develops an anomalous structure
as a function of scattering length and is drastically reduced compared with the
mean-field value. Furthermore, the density profile of a Bose gas in a harmonic
trap is found to develop a flat top near the center. This is due to the
anomalous behavior of compressibility and can be a potential smoking gun for
probing such an effect.

research attention due to its wide applications. While most of single-mode
lasers in coupled microdisks or microrings have been qualitatively explained by
either Vernier effect or inversed Vernier effect, none of them have been
experimentally confirmed. Here, we studied the mechanism for single-mode
operation in coupled microdisks. We found that the mode numbers had been
significantly reduced to nearly single-mode within a large pumping power range
from threshold to gain saturation. The detail laser spectra showed that the
largest gain and the first lasing peak were mainly generated by one disk and
the laser intensity was proportional to the frequency detuning. The
corresponding theoretical analysis showed that the experimental observations
were dominated by internal coupling within one cavity, which was similar to the
recently explored inversed Vernier effect in two coupled microrings. We believe
our finding will be important for understanding the previous experimental

shown remarkable denoising results which are equivalent or better than those of

after each iteration. Currently, this noise is estimated by using the filtered
noise in the previous iteration without considering the geometric structure of
the given image. This estimate may be affected in the presence of moderate and
severe levels of noise. To obtain a more reliable estimate of residual noise,
we propose a modified algorithm (GWNNM) which includes the contribution of the
geometric structure of an image to the existing noise estimation. Furthermore,
the proposed algorithm exploits the difference of large and small singular
values to enhance the edges and textures during the denoising process.
Consequently, the proposed modifications achieve significant improvements in
the denoising results of the existing low rank optimization algorithms.

the schemes based on the skyline of efficiency and utility, i.e., based on
whether a method is dominated on both aspects or not. Using exhaustive
experiments on four real datasets with different characteristics, we conclude
that there are always trade-offs in terms of utility and efficiency. We
demonstrate that the schemes derived from our novel block combinations provide
the best trade-offs for time critical applications. Our work can serve as a
guide to help practitioners engineer a differentially private histogram scheme

tool to study low-energy fission in nuclei far away from the beta-stability
line, especially for nuclei which do not fission spontaneously. Purpose: The
aim of this paper is to investigate systematic trends in bDF partial
half-lives. Method: A semi-phenomenological framework was developed to
systematically account for the behavior of bDF partial half-lives. Results: The
bDF partial half-life appears to exponentially depend on the difference between
the Q value for beta decay of the parent nucleus and the fission-barrier energy
of the daughter (after beta decay) product. Such dependence was found to arise
naturally from some simple theoretical considerations. Conclusions: This
systematic trend was confirmed for experimental bDF partial half-lives spanning
over 7 orders of magnitudes when using fission barriers calculated from either
the Thomas-Fermi or the liquid-drop fission model. The same dependence was also
observed, although less pronounced, when comparing to fission barriers from the
finite-range liquid-drop model or the Thomas-Fermi plus Strutinsky Integral
method.

the maximisation of the total rewards for the society without paying the

the reward probabilities of the options for the exploitation of past knowledge
and generate random fluctuations for the exploration of new knowledge. Our
results suggest that to optimise the social rewards, the utilisation of

role in finance. The availability of high frequency intraday data enables the
modeling of the realized covariance matrix directly. However, most models in

we propose a factor model with a diagonal CAW model for the factor realized

In an extensive empirical analysis, we find that the number of parameters can

Furthermore, at a low temperature, the nature of the tunneling behavior is
ascertained by the current-voltage dependency that helps us feature direct
tunneling at a low bias and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling at a high bias for a
Pd-MoS2 contact due to the effective barrier shape modulation by biasing. In
contrast, only direct tunneling is observed for a Cr-MoS2 contact over the
entire applied bias range. In addition, simple analytical calculations were
carried out to extract Rc at the gating range, and the results are consistent

smaller than gravitational free fall. We aim to study the observational
evidence of the formation of coronal rain and to trace the detailed dynamics of
individual blobs. We used time series of the 171 \AA\, and 304 \AA\, spectral
lines obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar
Dynamic Observatory (SDO) above active region AR 11420 on February 22, 2012.
Observations show that a coronal loop disappeared in the 171 \AA\ channel and
appeared in the 304 \AA\ line$\text{}\text{}$ more than one hour later, which
indicates a rapid cooling of the coronal loop from 1 MK to 0.05 MK. An energy
estimation shows that the radiation is higher than the heat input, which
indicates so-called catastrophic cooling. The cooling was accompanied by the
formation of coronal rain in the form of falling cold plasma. We studied two
different sequences of falling blobs. The first sequence includes three
different blobs. The mean velocities of the blobs were estimated to be 50 km
s$^{-1}$, 60 km s$^{-1}$ and 40 km s$^{-1}$. A polynomial fit shows the
different values of the acceleration for different blobs, which are lower than
free-fall in the solar corona. The first and second blob move along the same
path, but with and without acceleration, respectively. We performed simple
numerical simulations for two consecutive blobs, which show that the second
blob moves in a medium that is modified by the passage of the first blob.
Therefore, the second blob has a relatively high speed and no acceleration, as
is shown by observations. The second sequence includes two different blobs with
mean velocities of 100 km s$^{-1}$ and 90 km s$^{-1}$, respectively.

Using a dynamical systems method, we determine the asymptotic future of plane
symmetric Bianchi type I spacetimes with a viscous mathematical fluid, keeping
track of the magnitude of the relative dissipative fluxes, which determines the
applicability of the Israel-Stewart theory. We consider the situations where
the dissipative mechanisms of shear and bulk viscosity are involved separately
and simultaneously. It is demonstrated that the only case in the given model
when the fluid asymptotically approaches local thermal equilibrium, and the
underlying assumptions of the Israel-Stewart theory are therefore not violated,
is that of a dissipative fluid with vanishing bulk viscosity. The truncated
Israel-Stewart equations for shear viscosity are found to produce solutions
which manifest pathological dynamical features and, in addition, to be strongly
sensitive to the choice of initial conditions. Since these features are
observed already in the case of an oversimplified mathematical fluid model, we
have no reason to assume that the truncation of the Israel-Stewart transport
equations will produce relevant results for physically more realistic fluids.
The possible role of bulk and shear viscosity in cosmological evolution is also
discussed.

principles to families of similar implementation variants as appearing in
product line engineering. Our proposed product line testing theory relies on
Modal Interface Automata (MIA) as behavioral specification formalism. MIA
enrich I/O-labeled transition systems with may/must modalities to distinguish
mandatory from optional behavior, thus providing a semantic notion of intrinsic
behavioral variability. In particular, MIA constitute a restricted, yet fully
expressive subclass of I/O-labeled modal transition systems, guaranteeing
desirable refinement and compositionality properties. The resulting modal-ioco
relation defined on MIA is preserved under MIA refinement, which serves as
variant derivation mechanism in our product line testing theory. As a result,
modal-ioco is proven correct in the sense that it coincides with traditional
ioco to hold for every derivable implementation variant. Based on this result,
a family-based product line conformance testing framework can be established.

$\pm$ 0.03 and find no evidence for a metallicity spread. This metallicity
makes NGC 4372 one of the most metal-poor galactic globular clusters. We also
find an {\alpha}-enhancement typical of halo globular clusters at this
metallicity. Significant spreads are observed in the abundances of light
elements. In particular we find a Na-O anti-correlation. Abundances of O are
relatively high compared with other globular clusters. This could indicate that
NGC 4372 was formed in an environment with high O for its metallicity. A Mg-Al
spread is also present which spans a range of more than 0.5 dex in Al
abundances. Na is correlated with Al and Mg abundances at a lower significance
level. This pattern suggests that the Mg-Al burning cycle is active. This
behavior can also be seen in giant stars of other massive, metal-poor clusters.

takes EMF data models as input and generates Web APIs following the REST
principles and relying on well-known libraries and standards, thus facilitating
its comprehension and maintainability. Additionally, EMF-REST integrates model

powered heterogeneous networks (HetNets). In this paper, focusing on
backhaul-aware joint user association and resource allocation for this type of
HetNets, we formulate an online optimization problem to maximize the network
utility reflecting proportional fairness. Since user association and resource
allocation are tightly coupled not only on resource consumption of the base
stations (BSs), but also in the constraints of their available energy and
backhaul, the closed-form solution is quite difficult to obtain. Thus, we solve
the problem distributively via employing some decomposition methods.
Specifically, at first, by adopting primal decomposition method, we decompose
the original problem into a lower-level resource allocation problem for each
BS, and a higher-level user association problem. For the optimal resource
allocation, we prove that a BS either assigns equal normalized resources or
provides equal long-term service rate to its served users. Then, the user
association problem is solved by Lagrange dual decomposition method, and a
completely distributed algorithm is developed. Moreover, applying results of
the subgradient method, we demonstrate the convergence of the proposed
distributed algorithm. Furthermore, in order to efficiently and reliably apply
the proposed algorithm to the future wireless networks with an extremely dense
BS deployment, we design a virtual user association and resource allocation
scheme based on the software-defined networking architecture. Lastly, numerical
results validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and the significant
improvement on network utility, load balancing and user fairness.

attention in the areas of graphics, image retrieval, and computer vision.
Almost always in state of the art approaches a large amount of ""best views"" are

these 2D projections of 3D models using predefined features.
  We argue that this two stage approach (view selection -- matching) is
pragmatic but also problematic because the ""best views"" are subjective and
ambiguous, which makes the matching inputs obscure. This imprecise nature of
matching further makes it challenging to choose features manually. Instead of
relying on the elusive concept of ""best views"" and the hand-crafted features,
we propose to define our views using a minimalism approach and learn features
for both sketches and views. Specifically, we drastically reduce the number of
views to only two predefined directions for the whole dataset. Then, we learn
two Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), one for the views and one for
the sketches. The loss function is defined on the within-domain as well as the
cross-domain similarities. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method is significantly better than state of the art
approaches, and outperforms them in all conventional metrics.

non-singular density distribution in the centre. If highly eccentric orbits are
locked near the centre, the characteristic growth rate of the instability is
much less than the Jeans and dynamic frequencies of the stars (slow modes). The
instability occurs only for even spherical harmonics and the perturbations are
purely growing (aperiodic). On the contrary, if all orbits nearly reach the
outer radius of the sphere, both even and odd harmonics are unstable. Unstable
odd modes oscillate having characteristic frequencies of the order of the

aperiodic mode and several oscillatory modes, the aperiodic mode being the most
unstable.
  The question of the nature of the radial orbit instability (ROI) is

lack of velocity dispersion of stars in the transverse direction. The second

replace the conventionally assumed high-resolution ADCs. The
information-theoretic tool of generalized mutual information (GMI) is exploited
to analyze the achievable data rates of the proposed system architecture and an
array of analytical results of engineering interest are obtained. For fixed
single input multiple output (SIMO) channels, a closed-form expression of the
GMI is derived, based on which the linear combiner is optimized. The analysis
is then extended to ergodic fading channels, for which tight lower and upper
bounds of the GMI are obtained. Impacts of dithering and imperfect channel
state information (CSI) are also investigated, and it is shown that dithering
can remarkably improve the system performance while imperfect CSI only
introduces a marginal rate loss. Finally, the analytical framework is applied
to the multi-user access scenario. Numerical results demonstrate that the
mixed-ADC architecture with a relatively small number of high-resolution ADCs
is able to achieve a large fraction of the channel capacity of conventional
architecture, while reduce the energy consumption considerably even compared
with antenna selection, for both single-user and multi-user scenarios.

The basic inputs are the Hess diagram built with the photometric measurements

metallicity. In short, each isochrone is shifted in apparent distance modulus
and colour excess until it crosses over the maximum possible Hess density.
Repeating this step for all available isochrones leads to the construction of
the solution map, in which the optimum values of age and metallicity - as well

colors, we can also realize three-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to the
Ising model, the $q$-state Potts models or the RSOS models. One can actually
assign colors to simplices of any dimensions (tetrahedra, triangles, edges and

broadening and forms the area like a ring shape from 3 to 15-minute
oscillations as function of height. These made a distinct boundary of umbrae
and penumbrae which suggest the comb structure, and indicate that the
oscillations could propagate along the inclined magnetic flux tubes from below.
The 3-minute strongly appeared in the broadly inclined penumbrae magnetic filed
lines and gave the clear light-bridge. The well known 5-minute was dominated in
the umbrae-penumbrae region boundary, the long 7-minute one was transparent in
the H$\alpha$ blue wing, but this was the same with 10 and 15-minute, it was
concentrated in the inner-penumbrae, as seen in the H$\alpha$ line center. From
these findings we propose a picture on the role of fibril as the fabric of
interaction between the layers, also the related activites around the active
region under investigation.

two kinds of methods, namely, the Proximal Gradient Method (PGM) and the

unifying framework provides tools to analyze the convergence of PGMs and CGMs
for non-smooth, (weakly) smooth, and further for structured problems such as

benefits of peer assistance can be limited by various obstacle factors such as
ISP friendliness - requiring peers to be within the same ISP, bitrate
stratification - the need to match peers with others needing similar bitrate,
and partial participation - some peers choosing not to redistribute content.
  This work relates potential gains from peer assistance to the average number
of users in a swarm, its capacity, and empirically studies the effects of these
obstacle factors at scale, using a month-long trace of over 2 million users in
London accessing BBC shows online. Results indicate that even when P2P swarms
are localised within ISPs, up to 88% of traffic can be saved. Surprisingly,
bitrate stratification results in 2 large sub-swarms and does not significantly
affect savings. However, partial participation, and the need for a minimum
swarm size do affect gains. We investigate improvements to gain from increasing
content availability through two well-studied techniques: content bundling -
combining multiple items to increase availability, and historical caching of
previously watched items. Bundling proves ineffective as increased server
traffic from larger bundles outweighs benefits of availability, but simple
caching can considerably boost traffic gains from peer assistance.

excitations to free formation, binding, and migration energies of defects is
illustrated in the case of bcc-Fe. First of all, the ground state properties of
the vacancy, the foreign atoms Cu, Y, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, V, Mo, Si, Al, Co, O, and
the O-vacancy pair are determined under constant volume (CV) as well as zero
pressure (ZP) conditions. Second, the phonon contribution to defect free
energies is calculated within the harmonic approximation using the equilibrium
atomic positions determined in the ground state under CV and ZP conditions.
Additionally, quasi-harmonic corrections are applied to the ZP-based data. A
simple transformation similar to the quasi-harmonic approach is found between
the CV- and ZP-based frequencies. Therefore, it is not necessary to calculate
these quantities and the corresponding defect free energies separately. In
contrast to ground state energetics the CV- and ZP-based defect free energies
do not become equal with increasing supercell size. Third, it was found that
the contribution of electron excitations to the defect free energy can lead to
an additional deviation of the total free energy from the ground state value or
can compensate the deviation caused by the phonon contribution. Finally,
self-diffusion via the vacancy mechanism is investigated. The ratio of the
respective CV- and ZP-based results for the vacancy diffusivity is nearly equal
to the reciprocal of that for the equilibrium concentration. This behaviour
leads to almost identical CV- and ZP-based values for the self-diffusion
coefficient. Obviously, this agreement is accidental. The consideration of the
temperature dependence of the magnetization yields self-diffusion data in very
good agreement with experiments.

features which accurately classify the regular from covert traffic in cloud and
estimates difference in distribution of data under analysis by means of scores.
It then adds context to the signature and finally using machine learning

The results show that the framework proposed is high in accuracy while being

belongs to a special class of multiferroic materials, whose properties are
predetermined by the rotoinversion symmetry. Unlike inversion, the
rotoinversion symmetry can be easily destroyed by the magnetization. Moreover,
due to specific structural pattern, the magnetic structure of Ba2CoGe2O7 is
relatively soft. Altogether, this leads to the rich variety of multiferroic
properties, where the magnetic structure can be easily deformed by the magnetic
field, inducing the electric polarization in the direction, which depends on
the direction of the magnetic field. In this paper, we show that all these
properties can be successfully explained on the basis of realistic low-energy
model, derived from the first-principles electronic structure calculations for
the magnetically active Co 3d bands, and the Berry-phase theory of electric
polarization. Particularly, we argue that the magnetization induced electric
polarization in Ba2CoGe2O7 is essentially local and expressed via the
expectation values of some dipole matrices, calculated in the Wannier basis of
the model, and the site-diagonal density matrices of the magnetic Co sites.
Thus, the basic aspects of the behavior of Ba2CoGe2O7 can be understood already
in the atomic limit, where both magnetic anisotropy and magnetoelectric
coupling are specified by density matrix. Then, the macroscopic polarization
can be found as a superposition of electric dipoles of the individual Co sites.
We discuss the behavior of interatomic magnetic interactions, main
contributions to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the spin canting, as
well as the similarities and differences of the proposed picture from the
phenomenological model of spin-dependent p-d hybridization.

operation of distribution networks, the results of which enables the operator
to have a thorough observation of the system. Thus, most distribution
management systems (DMS) include a single-phase state estimator. Due to
non-convexity of the SE problem, heuristic and Newton methods do not guarantee
the global solution. In contrast, SDP based SE is more promising to guarantee
the globally optimal solution since it represents and solves the problem in a
convex format. However, the observability of the power system is highly
vulnerable to the set of measurements while employing the SDP-based SE, which
is addressed in this report. An algorithm is proposed to generate additional
measurements using the measurement data already gathered. The SDP-based SE is
very sensitive to the level of noise in large power networks. Also, bad data
detection algorithms proposed for Newton methods do not work for the SDP-based
SE method due to larger number of state variables in SDP representation of
power network. In this report, an algorithm is proposed to generate additional
measurements using the measurement data already gathered in order to solve the
observability issue. A network separation algorithm is developed to solve the
entire problem for smaller sub-networks which include micro-PMUs to mitigate
the adverse effects of noise for huge networks. An algorithm based on
redundancy test is also developed for bad data detection. The algorithms are
tested on single phase and multiphase test systems. The algorithms are applied

policy determines for each user a subset of steps the user is allowed to
perform. Other security requirements, such as separation-of-duty, impose
constraints on which subsets of users may perform certain subsets of steps. The
\emph{workflow satisfiability problem} (WSP) is the problem of determining
whether there exists an assignment of users to workflow steps that satisfies
all such authorizations and constraints. An algorithm for solving WSP is
important, both as a static analysis tool for workflow specifications, and for
the construction of run-time reference monitors for workflow management
systems. Given the computational difficulty of WSP, it is important,
particularly for the second application, that such algorithms are as efficient
as possible.
  We introduce class-independent constraints, enabling us to model scenarios
where the set of users is partitioned into groups, and the identities of the
user groups are irrelevant to the satisfaction of the constraint. We prove that
solving WSP is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) for this class of constraints
and develop an FPT algorithm that is useful in practice. We compare the
performance of the FPT algorithm with that of SAT4J (a pseudo-Boolean SAT
solver) in computational experiments, which show that our algorithm
significantly outperforms SAT4J for many instances of WSP. User-independent
constraints, a large class of constraints including many practical ones, are a
special case of class-independent constraints for which WSP was proved to be
FPT (Cohen {\em et al.}, J. Artif. Intel. Res. 2014). Thus our results
considerably extend our knowledge of the fixed-parameter tractability of WSP.

(WGC) for general models of large-field inflation with a large number of axions
$N$. We first show that, from the bottom-up perspective, such models admit a
variety of different regimes for the enhancement of the effective axion decay
constant, depending on the amount of alignment and the number of instanton
terms that contribute to the scalar potential. This includes regimes of no
enhancement, power-law enhancement and exponential enhancement with respect to
$N$. As special cases, we recover the Pythagorean enhancement of $N$-flation,
the $N$ and $N^{3/2}$ enhancements derived by Bachlechner, Long and McAllister
and the exponential enhancement by Choi, Kim and Yun. We then analyze which
top-down constraints are put on such models from the requirement of consistency
with quantum gravity. In particular, the WGC appears to imply that the
enhancement of the effective axion decay constant must not grow parametrically
with $N$ for $N \gg 1$. On the other hand, recent works proposed that axions
might be able to violate this bound under certain circumstances. Our general
expression for the enhancement allows us to translate this possibility into a
condition on the number of instantons that couple to the axions. We argue that,
at large $N$, models consistent with quantum gravity must either allow
super-Planckian field excursions or have an enormous, possibly even
exponentially large, number of dominant instanton terms in the scalar
potential.

involving heat transfer, ranging from energy and microelectronics to food
processing and textiles. The theory and modeling of crystalline materials is in
some sense a solved problem, where one can now calculate the thermal
conductivity of any crystalline line compound from first principles [1,2] using
expressions based on the phonon gas model (PGM)[3,4]. However, modeling of
amorphous materials still has many open questions, because the PGM itself
becomes questionable when one cannot rigorously define the phonon velocities.
New theories and methods are therefore needed to understand phonon transport in
amorphous materials. In this letter, we used our recently developed Green-Kubo
modal analysis (GKMA) method to study amorphous silica (a-SiO2). The predicted
thermal conductivities exhibit excellent agreement with experiments at all
temperatures and anharmonic effects are included in the thermal conductivity
calculation for all types of modes in a-SiO2 for the first time. Previously,
localized modes (locons) have been thought to have a negligible contribution to
thermal conductivity, due to their highly localized nature, which conceptually
should prevent them from moving energy to another location. However, in a-SiO2
our results indicate that locons contribute more than 10% to the total thermal
conductivity from 400K to 800K and they are largely responsible for the
increase in thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 above room temperature. This is an
effect that cannot be explained by previous methods and therefore offers new
insight into the nature of phonon transport in amorphous/glassy materials.

region undergoing dramatic changes in its optical/near/mid-infrared brightness
by 2-4 mag. We present new multi-band photometry and near-infrared spectra,
combined with a synopsis of the existing literature data. Based on the
spectroscopy, the source is confirmed as a mid M dwarf, with evidence for
ongoing accretion. The near-infrared lightcurves show large-scale variations,
with 2-4 mag amplitude in the bands IJHK, with the object generally being bluer
when faint. Near its brightest state, the object shows colour changes
consistent with variable extinction of dAV~7 mag. High-cadence monitoring at
3.6mu reveals quasi-periodic variations with a typical timescale of 1-2 weeks.
The best explanation for these characteristics is a low-mass star seen through
circumstellar matter, whose complex variability is caused by changing
inhomogeneities in the inner parts of the disk. When faint, the direct stellar
emission is blocked; the near-infrared radiation is dominated by scattered
light. When bright, the emission is consistent with a photosphere strongly
reddened by circumstellar dust. Based on the available constraints, the
inhomogeneities have to be located at or beyond ~0.1 AU distance from the star.
If this scenario turns out to be correct, a major portion of the inner disk has
to be clumpy, structured, and/or in turmoil. In its observational
characteristics, this object resembles other types of YSOs with variability
caused in the inner disk. Compared to other objects, however, ISO-Oph-50 is
clearly an extreme case, given the large amplitude of the brightness and colour
changes combined with the erratic behaviour. ISO-Oph-50 has been near its
brightest state since 2013; further monitoring is highly encouraged.

sensing, actuation, and communication issues. At the local level, continuous
measurement and actuation is only approximated by the use of digital mechanisms
that measure and process information in order to compute and update new control
input values at discrete time instants. Interaction with other agents or
subsystems takes place, in general, through a digital communication channel
with limited bandwidth where transmission of continuous-time signals is not
possible. Additionally, communication channels may be subject to other
imperfections such as time-varying delays. This paper considers the problem of
consensus (or synchronization of state trajectories) of multi-agent systems
that are described by general linear dynamics and are connected using
undirected graphs. An event-triggered consensus protocol is proposed, where
each agent implements discretized and decoupled models of the states of its
neighbors. This approach not only avoids the need for continuous communication
between agents but also provides a decentralized method for transmission of
information in the presence of time-varying communication delays where each
agent decides its own broadcasting time instants based only on local
information. This method gives more flexibility for scheduling information
broadcasting compared to periodic and sampled-data implementations. The use of
discretized models by each agent allows for a periodic event-triggered strategy
where continuous actuation and continuous measurement of the states are not
necessary.

physics of fractional quantum Hall states on a lattice without an overall
magnetic field. The notion of Floquet fractional Chern insulators refers to the
potential possibilities to generate the underlying topological bandstructure by
means of Floquet engineering. In these schemes, a highly controllable and
strongly interacting system is periodically driven by an external force at a
frequency such that double tunneling events during one forcing period become
important and contribute to shaping the required effective energy bands. We
show that in the described circumstances it is necessary to take into account
also third order processes combining two tunneling events with interactions.
Referring to the obtained contributions as micromotion-induced interactions, we
find that those interactions tend to have a negative impact on the stability of
of fractional Chern insulating phases and discuss implications for future

in the pattern of information flow between subsystems of a complex network.
Methods: The presence of redundancy and/or synergy in multivariate time series
data renders difficult to estimate the neat flow of information from each
driver variable to a given target. We show that adopting an unnormalized
definition of Granger causality one may put in evidence redundant multiplets of
variables influencing the target by maximizing the total Granger causality to a
given target, over all the possible partitions of the set of driving variables.
Consequently we introduce a pairwise index of synergy which is zero when two
independent sources additively influence the future state of the system,
differently from previous definitions of synergy. Results: We report the
application of the proposed approach to resting state fMRI data from the Human
Connectome Project, showing that redundant pairs of regions arise mainly due to
space contiguity and interhemispheric symmetry, whilst synergy occurs mainly
between non-homologous pairs of regions in opposite hemispheres. Conclusions:
Redundancy and synergy, in healthy resting brains, display characteristic
patterns, revealed by the proposed approach. Significance: The pairwise synergy
index, here introduced, maps the informational character of the system at hand
into a weighted complex network: the same approach can be applied to other
complex systems whose normal state corresponds to a balance between redundant
and synergetic circuits.

of state (EoS) on both sides of the interface, i.e. for both the ash
(up-down-strange quark phase) and the fuel (up-down quark phase). It also
allows the user to explore strange quark seeding produced by different
processes including DM annihilation inside neutron stars. The simulations
provide a physical window to diagnose whether the combustion process will
simmer quietly and slowly, lead to a transition from deflagration to detonation
or a (quark) core-collapse explosion. Such an energetic phase transition (a
Quark-Nova) would have consequences in high-energy astrophysics and could aid
in our understanding of many still enigmatic astrophysical transients.
Furthermore, having a precise understanding of the phase transition dynamics
for different EoSs could aid further in constraining the nature of the
non-perturbative regimes of QCD in general. We hope that Burn-UD will evolve

  This research proposes a novel outlier detection algorithm based on special

with frequent-low volume covers MTS items whilst a second accounts for high
volumes which is dedicated to MTO items. The third cluster resides between the
previous two with its elements being assigned to either the MTO or MTS class.
The algorithm can be applied to a variety of time series such as stationary and
non-stationary ones.

  memory","36 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, book chapter",,,,"q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How do mammalian cells that share the same genome exist in notably distinct
phenotypes, exhibiting differences in morphology, gene expression patterns, and
epigenetic chromatin statuses? Furthermore how do cells of different phenotypes
differentiate reproducibly from a single fertilized egg? These are fundamental
problems in developmental biology. Epigenetic histone modifications play an
important role in the maintenance of different cell phenotypes. The exact
molecular mechanism for inheritance of the modification patterns over cell
generations remains elusive. The complexity comes partly from the number of
molecular species and the broad time scales involved. In recent years
mathematical modeling has made significant contributions on elucidating the
molecular mechanisms of DNA methylation and histone covalent modification
inheritance. We will pedagogically introduce the typical procedure and some
technical details of performing a mathematical modeling study, and discuss
future developments.

4$ can be written as the sum of the square of a prime and a square-free number.
This makes explicit a theorem of Erd\H{o}s that every sufficiently large
integer of this type may be written in such a way. Our proof requires us to
construct new explicit results for primes in arithmetic progressions. As such,
we use the second author's numerical computation regarding GRH to extend the
explicit bounds of Ramar\'e-Rumely.

than the class of regularly varying (RV) functions, is proposed. This index is
the tail index of RV functions and this estimator is thus a new one on the
class of RV functions. This estimator satisfies, assuming suitable conditions,
strong consistency. Asymptotic normality of this estimator is proved for a
large class of RV functions, showing a better performance than some well-known
estimators. Illustrations with simulated and real life datasets are provided.
