equilibrium densities. The length of the critical influence zone is under
debate because for some properties, like shear viscosity, the extension is only
a few degrees, while for others, such as the density order parameter, the
critical influence zone range covers up to hundreds of degrees below the
critical temperature. Here we show that for a simple molecular potential of
ethane, the critical influence zone covers a wide zone of tens of degrees
(below the critical temperature) down to a transition temperature, at which the
apparent critical influence zone vanishes and the transition temperature can be
predicted through a pressure analysis of the coexisting bulk liquid phase. The
liquid phases within the apparent critical influence zone show low densities,
making them behave internally like their corresponding vapor phases. Therefore,
the experimentally observed wide extension of the critical influence zone is
due to a vapor-like effect due to low bulk liquid phase densities.

The global roughness scales with the film thickness $t$ as $W \sim

0.2$ is the growth exponent consistent with Villain-Lai-Das Sarma (VLDS)

apparent anomalous scaling for very low temperatures ($R\leq {10}^2$), which is
a consequence of large scaling corrections to asymptotic normal scaling. The
scaling variable $R^{3/2}\left( \epsilon + a\right)$ also represents the
temperature effects in the scaling of the correlation length and appears in the
dynamic scaling relation of the local roughness, which gives dynamic exponent
$z\approx 3.3$ also consistent with the VLDS class.

numerically. We find out that for a variety of specific values of parameters
the system may exhibit quite interesting dynamic behaviour. In particular, we
demonstrate that the system exhibits two different kinds of shear flow
instabilities: (a)~when the wave vectors evolve exponentially, the ion sound
modes become unstable as well; while, (b)~on the other hand, one can find areas
in a parametric space where, when the wave vectors vary periodically, the
physical system is subject to a strongly pronounced parametric instability. We
also show the possibility of the generation of beat wave phenomena,
characterized by a noteworthy quasi-periodic temporal behaviour. In the
conclusion, we discuss the possible areas of applications and further

developed a metric (termed ""Spectral Coherence,"" SC) based on the Fourier
frequency spectrum of motion in the SI direction, and analyzed the ability of
SC to predict motion-based errors and classify patients according to motion
characteristics. The amplitude of daily motion exceeded the predictions of
pre-treatment 4DCT imaging by an average of 3.0 mm, 2.3 mm, and 3.5 mm in the
AP, LR, and SI directions. SC was correlated with daily motion differences and
tumor dose coverage. In a simulated adaptive protocol, target margins were
adjusted based on SC, resulting in significant increases in mean target D95,
D99, and minimum dose. Our Fourier-based approach differentiates between
consistent and inconsistent motion characteristics of respiration and
correlates with daily motion deviations from pre-treatment 4DCT. The
feasibility of an SC-based adaptive protocol was demonstrated, and this
patient-specific respiratory information was used to improve target dosimetry

emerging as a lead alternative for main memory technology. While PCM achieves
low energy due to various technology-specific advantages, PCM is significantly
slower than DRAM (especially for writes) and can endure far fewer writes before
wearing out. Previous work has proposed to use a large, DRAM-based hardware
cache to absorb writes and provide faster access. However, due to ineffectual
caching where blocks are evicted before sufficient number of accesses, hardware
caches incur significant overheads in energy and bandwidth, two key but scarce
resources in modern multicores. Because using hardware for detecting and
removing such ineffectual caching would incur additional hardware cost and
complexity, we leverage the OS virtual memory support for this purpose. We
propose a DRAM-PCM hybrid memory architecture where the OS migrates pages on
demand from the PCM to DRAM. We call the DRAM part of our memory as
MigrantStore which includes two ideas. First, to reduce the energy, bandwidth,
and wear overhead of ineffectual migrations, we propose migration hysteresis.
Second, to reduce the software overhead of good replacement policies, we
propose recently- accessed-page-id (RAPid) buffer, a hardware buffer to track
the addresses of recently-accessed MigrantStore pages.

concentration of simulated dark matter halos using Voronoi tessellation.
TesseRACt is tested on idealized N-body halos that are axisymmetric, triaxial,
and contain substructure and compared to traditional least-squares fitting as
well as two non-parametric techniques that assume spherical symmetry. TesseRACt
recovers halo concentrations within 0.3% of the true value regardless of
whether the halo is spherical, axisymmetric, or triaxial. Traditional fitting
and non-parametric techniques that assume spherical symmetry can return
concentrations that are systematically off by as much as 10% from the true
value for non-spherical halos. TesseRACt also performs significantly better
when there is substructure present outside $0.5R_{200}$. Given that
cosmological halos are rarely spherical and often contain substructure, we
discuss implications for studies of halo concentration in cosmological N-body
simulations including how choice of technique for measuring concentration might
bias scaling relations.

quadrupole, skew-quadrupole, dipole, and solenoidal components, as well as
torsion of the fiducial orbit and variation of beam energy is parameterized
using a generalized Courant-Snyder (CS) theory, which extends the original CS
theory for one degree of freedom to higher dimensions. The envelope function is
generalized into an envelope matrix, and the phase advance is generalized into
a 4D symplectic rotation, or an U(2) element. The 1D envelope equation, also
known as the Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation in quantum mechanics, is generalized
to an envelope matrix equation in higher dimensions. Other components of the
original CS theory, such as the transfer matrix, Twiss functions, and CS
invariant (also known as the Lewis invariant) all have their counterparts, with
remarkably similar expressions, in the generalized theory. The gauge group
structure of the generalized theory is analyzed. By fixing the gauge freedom
with a desired symmetry, the generalized CS parameterization assumes the form
of the modified Iwasawa decomposition, whose importance in phase space optics
and phase space quantum mechanics has been recently realized. This gauge fixing
also symmetrizes the generalized envelope equation and express the theory using
only the generalized Twiss function \beta.The generalized phase advance
completely determines the spectral and structural stability properties of a
general focusing lattice. For structural stability, the generalized CS theory
enables application of the Krein-Moser theory to greatly simplify the stability
analysis. The generalized CS theory provides an effective tool to study coupled
dynamics and to discover more optimized lattice design in the larger parameter
space of general focusing lattices.

In this paper, a new operating framework, called packetized direct load control
(PDLC), is proposed based on the notion of quantization of energy demand. This
control protocol is built on top of two communication protocols that carry
either complete or binary information regarding the operation status of the
appliances. We discuss the optimal demand side operation for both protocols and
analytically derive the performance differences between the protocols. We
propose an optimal reservation strategy for traditional and renewable energy
for the PDLC in both day-ahead and real time markets. In the end we discuss the
fundamental trade-off between achieving controllability and endowing
flexibility.

only indirect information about the gluon Sivers function through the relation
with the quark-gluon and tri-gluon Qiu-Sterman functions, current data from
hadronic collisions at RHIC have not yet been translated into a solid

deuteron data, allow for a gluon Sivers contribution that is of the natural
size expected from large $N_c$ arguments, which is ${\cal O}(1/N_c)$ times the
nonsinglet quark Sivers contribution. Several very promising processes to
measure the gluon Sivers effect directly have been put forward, which apart
from ongoing and future investigations at RHIC, would strongly favor
experiments at AFTER@LHC and a possible future Electron-Ion Collider. Due to
the inherent process dependence of TMDs, the gluon Sivers TMD probed in the
various processes are not necessarily the same, but rather can be different
linear combinations of two universal gluon Sivers functions that have different
behavior under charge conjugation and that therefore satisfy different
theoretical constraints. For this reason both hadronic and DIS type of

research. Deploying commercial wireless communication services in radar bands
give wireless operators the much needed additional spectrum to meet the growing

fundamentally different systems interference concerns must be addressed. In
order to assess interference concerns we design a three-dimensional (3D)

uses a two-dimensional (2D) antenna array and the BS uses a one-dimensional
(1D) antenna array. We formulate a line-of-sight (LoS) channel and then propose
an algorithm that mitigates radar interference to BSs. We extend the previously
proposed null space projection algorithm for 2D channels to 3D channels and
show that effective nulls can be placed by utilizing both the azimuth and
elevation angle information of BSs. This results in effective interference
mitigation. In addition we show that the 3D channel model allows us to
accurately classify the size of radar's search space when null space projection
algorithm is used for interference mitigation.

diffeomorphism invariance. New complications arise here: in particular, the
kinetic term of the fluctuations can change sign somewhere along the instanton.
We show that in this case the mode functions remain non-singular, and the
tunnelling negative mode continues to exist. Moreover, the eigenvalues vary
continuously when the potential is varied such that the kinetic term of the

additional existence of an infinite tower of negative modes, whose significance

will likely be used in more scenarios such as battlefields and emergency

question; what if the computer systems for these robots are attacked, taken
over and even turned into weapons? Our work seeks to answer this question by
systematically analyzing possible cyber security attacks against Raven II, an
advanced teleoperated robotic surgery system. We identify a slew of possible
cyber security threats, and experimentally evaluate their scopes and impacts.
We demonstrate the ability to maliciously control a wide range of robots
functions, and even to completely ignore or override command inputs from the
surgeon. We further find that it is possible to abuse the robot's existing
emergency stop (E-stop) mechanism to execute efficient (single packet) attacks.
We then consider steps to mitigate these identified attacks, and experimentally
evaluate the feasibility of applying the existing security solutions against
these threats. The broader goal of our paper, however, is to raise awareness
and increase understanding of these emerging threats. We anticipate that the
majority of attacks against telerobotic surgery will also be relevant to other
teleoperated robotic and co-robotic systems.

bispectrum generated at late-times by gravitational instability. We parametrize
the evolution of the first and second-order equations of motion as proposed by

the linear growth rate have much higher signal-to-noise than bispectrum
measurements, this indicates that for Horndeski models which reproduce the
expansion history and the linear growth rate as predicted by GR the dark matter
bispectrum kernel can be effectively modelled as the standard GR one. On the
other hand, an observation of a large bispectrum deviation that can not be
explained in terms of bias would imply either that the evolution of
perturbations is strongly different than the evolution predicted by GR or that
the theory of gravity is exotic (e.g., breaks the weak equivalence principle)

supports solitary waves and another one (with mass ratio 0.55) supports
nonstationary pulses which preserve their identity only on relatively short

amplitude tails generated by oscillating small mass particles. Pulse
attenuation in experiments in the chain with mass ratio 0.55 was faster at the
same number of the particles from the entrance than in the chain with mass

faster attenuation than chain with mass ratio 0.55 due to the fact that the

velocities of neighboring particles. The investigated chains demonstrated
different wave structure at zero dissipation and at intermediate damping
coefficients and the similar behavior at large damping.

one or another particular investigation, in contact with an unpredictable
environment. From the practical uses of clocks, we abstract a clock enlivened
with the computational capacity of a Turing machine, modified to transmit and
to receive numerical communications. Such ""live clocks"" phase the steps of
their computations to mesh with the arrival of transmitted numbers. We lift
this phasing, known in digital communications, to a principle of \emph{logical
synchronization}, distinct from the synchronization defined by Einstein in
special relativity.
  Logical synchronization elevates digital communication to a topic in physics,
including applications to biology. One explores how feedback loops in clocking
affect numerical signaling among entities functioning in the face of
unpredictable influences, making the influences themselves into subjects of
investigation. The formulation of communications networks in terms of live
clocks extends information theory by expressing the need to actively maintain
communications channels, and potentially, to create or drop them.
  We show how networks of live clocks are presupposed by the concept of
coordinates in a spacetime. A network serves as an organizing principle, even
when the concept of the rigid body that anchors a special-relativistic
coordinate system is inapplicable, as is the case, for example, in a generic

for exploring rare dynamical behaviors of complex systems in an unbiased way.
Carrying out this sampling, however, requires an ability to propose changes to
dynamical pathways that are substantial, yet sufficiently modest to obtain
reasonable acceptance rates. Satisfying this requirement becomes very
challenging in the case of long trajectories, due to the characteristic
divergences of chaotic dynamics. Here we examine schemes for addressing this
problem, which engineer correlation between a trial trajectory and its
reference path, for instance using artificial forces. Our analysis is
facilitated by a modern perspective on Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling,
inspired by non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, which clarifies the types of
sampling strategies that can scale to long trajectories. Viewed in this light,
the most promising such strategy guides a trial trajectory by manipulating the
sequence of random numbers that advance its stochastic time evolution, as done
in a handful of existing methods. In cases where this ""noise guidance""
synchronizes trajectories effectively, as the Glauber dynamics of a
two-dimensional Ising model, we show that efficient path sampling can be
achieved even for very long trajectories.

nested-grids and achieves a resolution of one Jupiter's radius in the
circumplanetary disk. The code models solids as individual particles.
Planetesimals are subjected to gravitational forces by the star and the planet,
drag force by the gas, disruption via ram pressure, and mass loss through
ablation. The mass evolution of solids is calculated self-consistently with
their temperature, velocity, and position. We consider icy and icy/rocky bodies
of radius 0.1-100km, initially deployed on orbits around the star within a few
Hill radii (Rhill) of the planet's orbit. Planetesimals are scattered inward,
outward, and toward disk regions of radius r>>a_p. Scattering can relocate
significant amounts of solids, provided that regions |r-a_p|~ 3Rhill are
replenished with planetesimals. Scattered bodies can be temporarily captured on
planetocentric orbits. Ablation consumes nearly all solids at gas temperatures
> ~220K. Super-keplerian rotation around and beyond the outer edge of the gas
gap can segregate < ~0.1km bodies, producing solid gap edges at size-dependent
radial locations. Capture, break-up, and ablation of solids result in a
dust-laden circumplanetary disk with low surface densities of km-size
planetesimals, implying relatively long timescales for satellite formation.
After a giant planet acquires most of its mass, accretion of solids is unlikely
to alter significantly its heavy-element content. The luminosity generated by
solids' accretion can be of a similar order of magnitude to the contraction
luminosity.

investigate the robustness of the standard relation between the logarithmic

significantly from the standard expression for isothermal gases. Our main
result is a new density variance - Mach number relation that takes the

provides good fits for b*M <= 1. A theoretical model based on the
Rankine-Hugoniot shock jump conditions is derived, sigma_s^2 = ln
{1+(gamma+1)*b^2*M^2/[(gamma-1)*b^2*M^2+2]}, and provides good fits also for

softened, while constraints from all other astrophysical and cosmological

between 1% and 25%, being higher for groups with higher mass and/or more recent

infall, and their distances and velocities relative to the group center become
statistically similar to the overall satellite population after 4-8 Gyr. We
quantify the likelihood that satellites were associated with an LMC-mass group
as a function of both distance and velocity relative to the LMC at z=0. The
close proximity in distance of the nine Dark Energy Survey candidate dwarf
galaxies to the LMC suggest that ~2-4 are likely associated with the LMC.
Furthermore, if several of these dwarfs are genuine members, then the LMC-group
probably fell into the MW very recently, <2 Gyr ago. If the connection with the

correct fraction of galaxies in each population and with g-r colours within 0.1
magnitudes of those observed. Luminosity functions from UV to NIR wavelengths
differ from observations at a level comparable to systematic shifts resulting
from a choice between Petrosian and Kron photometric apertures. Despite the
generally good agreement there are clear discrepancies with observations. The
blue cloud of EAGLE galaxies extends to somewhat higher luminosities than in

to connect the emission from stellar populations, dust attenuation and dust
emission in a physically consistent way. We derive statistically and physically
robust estimates of the photometric redshifts and physical parameters for the
ALESS SMGs. We find that they have a median stellar mass
$M_\ast=(8.9\pm0.1)\times10^{10} M_\odot$, SFR$=280\pm70 M_\odot$/yr, overall
V-band dust attenuation $A_V=1.9\pm0.2$ mag, dust mass
$M_\rm{dust}=(5.6\pm1.0)\times10^8 M_\odot$, and average dust temperature
Tdust~40 K. The average intrinsic SED of the ALESS SMGs resembles that of local
ULIRGs in the IR range, but the stellar emission of our average SMG is brighter
and bluer, indicating lower dust attenuation, possibly because they are more
extended. We explore how the average SEDs vary with different parameters, and
we provide a new set of SMG templates. To put the ALESS SMGs into context, we
compare their stellar masses and SFRs with those of less actively star-forming
galaxies at the same redshifts. At z~2, about half of the SMGs lie above the
star-forming main sequence, while half are at the high-mass end of the
sequence. At higher redshifts (z~3.5), the SMGs tend to have higher SFR and
Mstar, but the fraction of SMGs that lie significantly above the main sequence
decreases to less than a third.

the neutron richness at the high temperatures predicted by the hydrodynamic
simulation. Circumventing the complexities of modelling three-dimensional
neutrino transport, (anti)neutrino captures are parameterized in terms of
prescribed neutrino luminosities and mean energies, guided by published results
and assumed as constant in time. Depending sensitively on the adopted
neutrino-antineutrino luminosity ratio, neutrino processes increase Y_e to
values between 0.25 and 0.40, still allowing for a successful r-process
compatible with the observed solar abundance distribution and a significant
fraction of the ejecta consisting of r-process nuclei. If the electron neutrino
luminosities and mean energies are relatively large compared to the
antineutrino properties, the mean Y_e might reach values >0.40 so that neutrino
captures seriously compromise the success of the r-process. In this case, the
r-abundances remain compatible with the solar distribution, but the total
amount of ejected r-material is reduced to a few percent, because the
production of iron-peak elements is favored. Proper neutrino physics, in
particular also neutrino absorption, have to be included in BNSM simulations
before final conclusions can be drawn concerning r-processing in this

peak brightness and color temperature are sensitive to the

Our starting point is the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) family of ghost free
massive gravities and using a simple model of this family, we are able to
express this action and these equations of motion in terms of a single metric
in which the graviton propagates, hence removing in particular the need for a
""reference metric"" which is present in the non perturbative formulation. We
show further how 5 covariant constraints can be obtained including one which
leads to the tracelessness of the graviton on flat space-time and removes the
Boulware-Deser ghost. This last constraint involves powers and combinations of
the curvature of the background metric. The 5 constraints are obtained for a
background metric which is unconstrained, i.e. which does not have to obey the
background field equations. We then apply these results to the case of Einstein
space-times, where we show that the 5 constraints become trivial, and
Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker space-times, for which we correct in

derive several non trivial identities, syzygies, involving the graviton fields,
its derivatives and the background metric curvature. These identities have
their own interest. We also discover that there exist backgrounds for which the

diffusion through the borders of the countries. The physical capital is
considered an important variable for the economic growth of a country. Here we
use an extension of the economic Solow model to describe how the smuggling
affects the economic growth of the countries. In this study we rely on a
production function that is non-concave instead of the classical Cobb-Douglas
production function. In order to model the physical capital diffusion through
the borders of the country, we developed a model based on a parabolic partial
differential equation that describes the dynamics of physical capital and
boundary conditions of Neumann type. Smuggling is present in many borders
between countries and may include fuel, machinery and food. This smuggling
through the borders is a problematic issue for the country's economies. The
smuggling problem usually is related mainly to a non-official exchange rate
that is different than the official rate or subsides. Numerical simulations are
obtained using an explicit finite difference scheme that shows how the physical
capital diffusion through the border of the countries. The study of physical
capital is a paramount issue for the economic growth of many countries for the
next years. The results show that the dynamics of the physical capital when
boundary conditions of Neumann type are different than zero differ from the
classical economic behavior observed in the classical spatial Solow model
without physical capital flux through the borders of countries. Finally, it can
be concluded that avoiding the smuggling through the frontiers is an important
factor that affects the economic growth of the countries.

emerging patterns similar to those formed in observations, e.g. the inverted
polarity against Hale's law, the curvilinear motion of the spot, strong
transverse field with highly sheared magnetic and velocity fields at the PIL.
Strong current builds up at the PIL, giving rise to reconnection, which
produces a complex coronal magnetic connectivity with non-potential fields in

undervariability, indicating that these ensembles do not sample a wide enough

first performs a deterministic step (computation of the gradient of the

stochastic steps. The process is repeated a few times with the last iterate
becoming the new starting point. The novelty of our method is in introduction
of mini-batching into the computation of stochastic steps. In each step,
instead of choosing a single function, we sample $b$ functions, compute their
gradients, and compute the direction based on this. We analyze the complexity
of the method and show that it benefits from two speedup effects. First, we
prove that as long as $b$ is below a certain threshold, we can reach any
predefined accuracy with less overall work than without mini-batching. Second,
our mini-batching scheme admits a simple parallel implementation, and hence is
suitable for further acceleration by parallelization.

variety of outstanding physical phenomena. Examples range from the existence of
multiferroics, to current induced spin orbit torques (SOT) and the formation of
topological magnetic structures. In this letter we bring into light a novel
effect of the structural inversion asymmetry (SIA): a chiral damping mechanism.
This phenomenon is evidenced by measuring the field driven domain wall (DW)
motion in perpendicularly magnetized asymmetric Pt/Co/Pt trilayers. The
difficulty in evidencing the chiral damping is that the ensuing DW dynamics
exhibit identical spatial symmetry to those expected from the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Despite this fundamental resemblance,
the two scenarios are differentiated by their time reversal properties: while
DMI is a conservative effect that can be modeled by an effective field, the
chiral damping is purely dissipative and has no influence on the equilibrium
magnetic texture. When the DW motion is modulated by an in-plane magnetic
field, it reveals the structure of the internal fields experienced by the DWs,
allowing to distinguish the physical mechanism. The observation of the chiral
damping, not only enriches the spectrum of physical phenomena engendered by the
SIA, but since it can coexists with DMI it is essential for conceiving DW and
skyrmion devices.

and coronal temperatures at very high resolution which reveal essential
characteristics of thermally unstable plasmas. Coronal rain is found to be a
highly multi-thermal phenomenon with a high degree of co-spatiality in the
multi-wavelength emission. EUV darkening and quasi-periodic intensity
variations are found to be strongly correlated to coronal rain showers.
Progressive cooling of coronal rain is observed, leading to a height dependence
of the emission. A fast-slow two-step catastrophic cooling progression is
found, which may reflect the transition to optically thick plasma states. The
intermittent and clumpy appearance of coronal rain at coronal heights becomes
more continuous and persistent at chromospheric heights just before impact,
mainly due to a funnel effect from the observed expansion of the magnetic
field. Strong density inhomogeneities on spatial scales of 0.2""-0.5"" are found,
in which TR to chromospheric temperature transition occurs at the lowest
detectable scales. The shape of the distribution of coronal rain widths is
found to be independent of temperature with peaks close to the resolution limit
of each telescope, ranging from 0.2"" to 0.8"". However we find a sharp increase
of clump numbers at the coolest wavelengths and especially at higher
resolution, suggesting that the bulk of the rain distribution remains
undetected. Rain clumps appear organised in strands in both chromospheric and
TR temperatures, suggesting an important role of thermal instability in the
shaping of fundamental loop substructure. We further find structure reminiscent
of the MHD thermal mode. Rain core densities are estimated to vary between
2x10^{10} cm^{-3} and 2.5x10^{11} cm^{-3} leading to significant downward mass
fluxes per loop of 1-5x10^{9} g s^{-1}, suggesting a major role in the

constraint- handling strategy is needed. This paper focuses on the class of
constraint-handling strategies that repair infeasible solutions by bringing
them back into the search space and explicitly preserve feasibility of the
solutions. Several existing constraint-handling strategies are studied, and two
new single parameter constraint-handling methodologies based on parent-centric
and inverse parabolic probability (IP) distribution are proposed. The existing

GAs, and simulation results on four scalable test-problems under different

constraint-handling methods exhibit robustness in terms of performance and also
succeed on search spaces comprising up-to 500 variables while locating the
optimum within an error of 10$^{-10}$. The working principle of the IP based

electricity market, a novel control scheme is developed based on discrete-time
model predictive control (MPC) to ensure the optimal operation of the BESS in

policy to sell more energy at peak demand times and store it at off-peaks in
compliance with the Australian National Electricity Market rules. The
performance of the control system is assessed under different scenarios using
actual wind farm and electricity price data in simulation environment. The
second part considers the control of overhead crane systems for automatic

minimum load swings, a new modeling approach is developed based on independent
joint control strategy which considers actuators as the main plant. The
nonlinearities of overhead crane dynamics are treated as disturbances acting on

swing control is also designed based on passivity-based control to suppress

state feedback control to track reference trajectories along with a feedforward
control to compensate for disturbances using computed torque control and a
novel disturbance observer. The practical results on an experimental overhead

\emph{sub linearly} as $\mathcal{O} \left( \frac{N}{P} \right)$, where $N$ is

support massive content delivery over wireless networks. However, existing
scheduling designs do not make full use of the advantages of the two
approaches. In this paper, we consider the optimal dynamic multicast scheduling
to jointly minimize the average delay, power, and fetching costs for
cache-enabled content-centric wireless networks. We formulate this stochastic
optimization problem as an infinite horizon average cost Markov decision
process (MDP). It is well-known to be a difficult problem due to the curse of
dimensionality, and there generally only exist numerical solutions. By using
relative value iteration algorithm and the special structures of the request
queue dynamics, we analyze the properties of the value function and the
state-action cost function of the MDP for both the uniform and nonuniform
channel cases. Based on these properties, we show that the optimal policy,
which is adaptive to the request queue state, has a switch structure in the
uniform case and a partial switch structure in the nonuniform case. Moreover,
in the uniform case with two contents, we show that the switch curve is
monotonically non-decreasing. Then, by exploiting these structural properties
of the optimal policy, we propose two low-complexity optimal algorithms.
Motivated by the switch structures of the optimal policy, to further reduce the
complexity, we also propose a low-complexity suboptimal policy, which possesses
similar structural properties to the optimal policy, and develop a
low-complexity algorithm to compute this policy.

that can be carried by any quantum system. On the one hand, Holevo bound rules
out the possibility to encode more information in a quantum system than in its
classical counterpart, comprised of perfectly distinguishable states. On the
other hand, when states are uniformly distributed in the state space, the
so-called subentropy lower bound is saturated. How uniform quantum systems are
can be naturally quantified by characterizing them as $t$-designs, with $t =
\infty$ corresponding to the uniform distribution. Here we show the existence
of a trade-off between the uniformity of a quantum system and the amount of
information it can carry. To this aim, we derive a hierarchy of informational
bounds as a function of $t$ and prove their tightness for qubits and qutrits.
By deriving asymptotic formulae for large dimensions, we also show that the
statistics generated by any $t$-design with $t > 1$ contains no more than a
single bit of information, and this amount decreases with $t$. Holevo and
subentropy bounds are recovered as particular cases for $t = 1$ and $t =

lengths vanishes away if one premises that they have discovered a way to
generate linear waves analogous to compressional sound. These can be used to
detect length at either large or small scales using echo timing and fringe
counting. It is shown that suitable linear chemical potential waves can, in
fact, be manufactured by tuning to criticality conventional reaction-diffusion
with a small number substances. Min oscillations in E. coli are cited as
precedent resonant length measurement using chemical potential waves analogous
to laser detection. Mitotic structures in eucaryotes are identified as
candidates for such an effect at higher frequency. The engineering principle is
shown to be very general and functionally the same as that used by hearing
organs.
  PNAS Significance Statement: This paper invokes physical principles to
address the question of how living things might use reaction-diffusion to
measure out and regulate the many thousands of lengths required to make their
body parts and internal organs. It argues that two ideas have been missing. One
is that oscillation is necessary to achieve the necessary design stability and
plasticity. The other is that the system must be tuned to criticality to
stabilize the propagation velocity, thus enabling clocks to function as meter
sticks. The broader significance is twofold: First, a fundamental piece of the
machinery of life is probably invisible to present-day biochemical methods
because they are too slow. Second, the simplicity of growth and form identified
a century ago by D'Arcy Thompson is probably a symptom of biological
engineering strategies, not primitive law.

transportation management, etc., average travel speed for a road means the
average speed of vehicles travelling through this road in a given time
duration. Traditional ways for collecting travel-speed oriented traffic data
always depend on dedicated sensors and supporting infrastructures, and are
therefore financial costly. Differently, vehicular crowdsensing as an
infrastructure-free way, can be used to collect data including real-time
locations and velocities of vehicles for road travel speed estimation, which is
a quite low-cost way. However, vehicular crowdsensing data is always
coarse-grained. This coarseness can lead to the incompleteness of travel
speeds. Aiming to handle this problem as well as estimate travel speed
accurately, in this paper, we propose an approach named STC that exploits the
spatial-temporal correlation among travel speeds for roads by introducing the
time-lagged cross correlation function. The time lagging factor describes the
time consumption of traffic feature diffusion along roads. To properly
calculate cross correlation, we novelly make the determination of the time
lagging factor self-adaptive by recording the locations of vehicles at
different roads. Then, utilizing the local stationarity of cross correlation,
we further reduce the problem of single-road travel speed vacancy completion to
a minimization problem. Finally, we fill all the vacancies of travel speed for
roads in a recursive way using the geometric structure of road net. Elaborate
experiments based on real taxi trace data show that STC can settle the
incompleteness problem of vehicle crowdsensing data based travel speed
estimation and ensure the accuracy of estimated travel speed better, in
comparison with representative existing methods such as KNN, Kriging and ARIMA.

propose a strategy to create giant splitting of the valley degeneracy by
proximity-induced Zeeman effect. As a demonstration, our first principles
calculations of monolayer MoTe$_2$ on a EuO substrate show that valley
splitting over 300 meV can be generated. The proximity coupling also makes
interband transition energies valley dependent, enabling valley selection by
optical frequency tuning in addition to circular polarization. The valley
splitting in the heterostructure is also continuously tunable by rotating

processes to simulate dwarf galaxies in sufficient details. Accurate numerical
simulations of individual dwarf galaxies are thus still in demand. We aim at
(i) studying in detail the coupling between stars and gas in a galaxy,
exploiting the so-called stellar hydrodynamical approach, and (ii) studying the
chemo-dynamical evolution of individual galaxies starting from
self-consistently calculated initial gas distributions. We present a novel
chemo-dynamical code in which the dynamics of gas is computed using the usual
hydrodynamics equations, while the dynamics of stars is described by the
stellar hydrodynamics approach, which solves for the first three moments of the
collisionless Boltzmann equation. The feedback from stellar winds and dying
stars is followed in detail. In particular, a novel and detailed approach has
been developed to trace the aging of various stellar populations, which enables
an accurate calculation of the stellar feedback depending on the stellar age.
We build initial equilibrium models of dwarf galaxies that take gas
self-gravity into account and present different levels of rotational support.
Models with high rotational support develop prominent bipolar outflows; a
newly-born stellar population in these models is preferentially concentrated to
the galactic midplane. Models with little rotational support blow away a large
fraction of the gas and the resulting stellar distribution is extended and
diffuse. The stellar dynamics turns out to be a crucial aspect of galaxy
evolution. If we artificially suppress stellar dynamics, supernova explosions
occur in a medium heated and diluted by the previous activity of stellar winds,
thus artificially enhancing the stellar feedback (abridged).

of variable objects has become the main objective of time-domain astronomy.
Classification of irregularly sampled time series is particularly difficult
because the data cannot be represented naturally as a vector which can be
directly fed into a classifier. In the literature, various statistical features
serve as vector representations. In this work, we represent time series by a
density model. The density model captures all the information available,
including measurement errors. Hence, we view this model as a generalisation to
the static features which directly can be derived, e.g., as moments from the
density. Similarity between each pair of time series is quantified by the
distance between their respective models. Classification is performed on the
obtained distance matrix. In the numerical experiments, we use data from the
OGLE and ASAS surveys and demonstrate that the proposed representation performs
up to par with the best cur- rently used feature-based approaches. The density
representation preserves all static information present in the observational
data, in contrast to a less complete description by features. The density
representation is an upper boundary in terms of information made available to
the classifier. Consequently, the predictive power of the proposed
classification depends on the choice of similarity measure and classifier,
only. Due to its principled nature, we advocate that this new approach of
representing time series has potential in tasks beyond classification, e.g.,
unsupervised learning.

node sending some common information to a group of closely located users, where
each link is subject to certain packet erasures. To ensure reliable information
reception by all users, the conventional approach generally requires repeated
transmission by the source until all the users are able to decode the
information, which is inefficient in many practical scenarios. In this paper,
by exploiting the close proximity among the users, we propose a novel two-phase
wireless broadcasting protocol with user cooperations based on an efficient
batched network code, known as batched sparse (BATS) code. In the first phase,
the information packets are encoded into batches with BATS encoder and
sequentially broadcasted by the source node until certain terminating criterion
is met. In the second phase, the users cooperate with each other by exchanging
the network-coded information via peer-to-peer (P2P) communications based on
their respective received packets. A fully distributed and light-weight
scheduling algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency of the P2P
communication in the second phase. The performance of the proposed two-phase
protocol is analyzed and the channel rank distribution at the instance of
decoding is derived, based on which the optimal BATS code is designed.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly
outperforms the existing schemes. Lastly, the performance of the proposed
scheme is further verified via testbed experiments.

This phenomenon, which extends the linear Lax-Mizohata theorem, was explained
by G. M\'etivier in [{\it Remarks on the well-posedness of the nonlinear Cauchy

transition from hyperbolicity to non-hyperbolicity, that is the limiting case

we prove that even a weak defect of hyperbolicity implies a strong Hadamard

order effects in electroweak interactions. One specific class of processes is
the penguin-like diagram. Such class of diagrams involves the neutral change of
quark flavours accompanied by the emission of a gluon (gluon penguin), a photon
(photon penguin), a gluon and a photon (gluon-photon penguin), a Z-boson (Z

tree level in the Standard Model. They are, however, induced by one-loop
effects. In this paper, we present an exact calculation of the penguin diagram
vertices in the tHooft-Feynman gauge. Renormalization of the vertex is effected
by a prescription by Chia and Chong which gives an expression for the counter
term identical to that obtained by employing Ward-Takahashi identity. The
on-shell vertex functions for the penguin diagram vertices are obtained. The
various penguin diagram vertex functions are related to one another via
Ward-Takahashi identity. From these, a set of relations is obtained connecting
the vertex form factors of various penguin diagrams. Explicit expressions for

intend to find new cases of post-AGB stars and PNe with water maser emission,
including water fountains or water-maser-emitting PNe. We observed water maser
emission in a sample of 133 objects, with a significant fraction being post-AGB
and young PN candidate sources with strong obscuration. We detected this
emission in 15 of them, of which seven are reported here for the first time. We
identified three water fountain candidates: IRAS 17291-2147, with a total
velocity spread of ~96 km/s in its water maser components and two sources (IRAS
17021-3109 and IRAS 17348-2906) that show water maser emission outside the
velocity range covered by OH masers. We have also identified IRAS 17393-2727 as
a possible new water-maser-emitting PN. The detection rate is higher in
obscured objects (14%) than in those with optical counterparts (7%), consistent
with previous results. Water maser emission seems to be common in objects that
are bipolar in the near-IR (43% detection rate). The water maser spectra of
water fountain candidates like IRAS 17291-2147 show significantly less maser
components than others (e.g., IRAS 18113-2503). We speculate that most
post-AGBs may show water maser emission with wide enough velocity spread (> 100
km/s) when observed with enough sensitivity and/or for long enough periods of
time. Therefore, it may be necessary to single out a special group of ""water
fountains"", probably defined by their high maser luminosities. We also suggest
that the presence of both water and OH masers in a PN is a better tracer of its
youth, rather than the presence of just one of these species.

comparative morphologies and of interest to the micro-air-vehicle (MAV)
community. Recent studies, however, show apparently contradictory results of
either some significant extra lift or power savings, or zero ground effect.
Here we present a numerical study of fruitfly sized insect takeoff with a
specific focus on the significance of leg thrust and wing kinematics.
Flapping-wing takeoff is studied using numerical modelling and high performance
computing. The aerodynamic forces are calculated using a three-dimensional
Navier--Stokes solver based on a pseudo-spectral method with volume
penalization. It is coupled with a flight dynamics solver that accounts for the
body weight, inertia and the leg thrust, while only having two degrees of
freedom: the vertical and the longitudinal horizontal displacement. The natural
voluntary takeoff of a fruitfly is considered as reference. The parameters of
the model are then varied to explore possible effects of interaction between
the flapping-wing model and the ground plane. These modified takeoffs include
cases with decreased leg thrust parameter, and/or with periodic wing
kinematics, constant body pitch angle. The results show that the ground effect
during natural voluntary takeoff is negligible. In the modified takeoffs, when
the rate of climb is slow, the difference in the aerodynamic forces due to the
interaction with the ground is up to 6%. Surprisingly, depending on the
kinematics, the difference is either positive or negative, in contrast to the
intuition based on the helicopter theory, which suggests positive excess lift.
This effect is attributed to unsteady wing-wake interactions. A similar effect
is found during hovering.

accommodated via a covariance function for the former and a neighborhood
structure for the latter. In both cases the resulting spatial structure is a
consequence of implicit spatial grouping in that observations near in space are
assumed to behave similarly. It would be desirable to develop spatial methods
that explicitly model the partitioning of spatial locations providing more
control over resulting spatial structures and being able to better balance
global vs local spatial dependence. To this end, we extend product partition
models to a spatial setting so that the partitioning of locations into
spatially dependent clusters is explicitly modeled. We explore the spatial
structures that result from employing a spatial product partition model and
demonstrate its flexibility in accommodating many types of spatial
dependencies. We illustrate the method's utility through simulation studies and

modelling of stars. In the case of slowly pulsating B-type (SPB) pulsators, the
simple zero-rotation approach so far used for mode identification is usually
not valid because pulsational frequencies are often of the order of the
rotational frequency. Moreover, this approach allows us to determine only the
spherical harmonic degree, $\ell$, while the azimuthal order, $m$, is beyond
its reach. On the other hand, because of the density of oscillation spectra of
SPB stars, knowledge of $m$ is indispensable if one wants to assign the radial
order, $n$, to the observed frequency peaks. Including the effects of rotation
via the traditional approximation, we perform identification of the mode
angular numbers ($\ell,~m$) for 31 SPB stars with available multicolour time
series photometry. Simultaneously, constraints on the rotational velocity,
$V_{\rm rot}$, and the inclination angle, $i$, are determined assuming uniform
rotation and a constant value of $V_{\rm rot}\sin i$. Dependence of the results
on the adopted model is tested using HD\,21071 as an example. Despite some
model uncertainties and limitations of the method, our studies show the correct
approach to identifying the low-frequency oscillation modes.

that, given the labels of two nodes and no other information regarding the
graph, it is possible to determine the distance between the two nodes. The
challenge in such a distance labeling scheme is primarily to minimize the
maximum label lenght and secondarily to minimize the time needed to answer
distance queries (decoding). Previous schemes have offered different trade-offs
between label lengths and query time. This paper presents a simple algorithm
with shorter labels and shorter query time than any previous solution, thereby
improving the state-of-the-art with respect to both label length and query time
in one single algorithm. Our solution addresses several open problems
concerning label length and decoding time and is the first improvement of label
length for more than three decades.
  More specifically, we present a distance labeling scheme with label size (log
3)/2 + o(n) (logarithms are in base 2) and O(1) decoding time. This outperforms
all existing results with respect to both size and decoding time, including
Winkler's (Combinatorica 1983) decade-old result, which uses labels of size
(log 3)n and O(n/log n) decoding time, and Gavoille et al. (SODA'01), which
uses labels of size 11n + o(n) and O(loglog n) decoding time. In addition, our
algorithm is simpler than the previous ones. In the case of integral edge
weights of size at most W, we present almost matching upper and lower bounds
for label sizes. For r-additive approximation schemes, where distances can be
off by an additive constant r, we give both upper and lower bounds. In
particular, we present an upper bound for 1-additive approximation schemes
which, in the unweighted case, has the same size (ignoring second order terms)
as an adjacency scheme: n/2. We also give results for bipartite graphs and for
exact and 1-additive distance oracles.

interaction induces a Bose-like condensation of these preformed pairs leading
to the superconducting (SC) state. Below $T_c$, both the condensation energy
and the pair-pair interaction $\beta$ are proportional to the condensate
density $N_{oc}(T)$, whereas the usual Fermi-level spectral gap $\Delta_p$ is
independent of temperature. The new order parameter $\beta(T)$, can be followed
as a function of temperature, carrier concentration and disorder - i.e. the

System (GPS), are among the most important sensors for movement analysis. GPS
is widely used to record the trajectories of vehicles, animals and human
beings. However, all GPS movement data are affected by both measurement and
interpolation error. In this article we show that measurement error causes a
systematic bias in distances recorded with a GPS: the distance between two
points recorded with a GPS is -- on average -- bigger than the true distance
between these points. This systematic `overestimation of distance' becomes
relevant if the influence of interpolation error can be neglected, which is the
case for movement sampled at high frequencies. We provide a mathematical
explanation of this phenomenon and we illustrate that it functionally depends
on the autocorrelation of GPS measurement error ($C$). We argue that $C$ can be
interpreted as a quality measure for movement data recorded with a GPS. If
there is strong autocorrelation any two consecutive position estimates have
very similar error. This error cancels out when average speed, distance or
direction are calculated along the trajectory.
  Based on our theoretical findings we introduce a novel approach to determine
$C$ in real-world GPS movement data sampled at high frequencies. We apply our
approach to a set of pedestrian and a set of car trajectories. We find that the
measurement error in the data is strongly spatially and temporally
autocorrelated and give a quality estimate of the data. Finally, we want to
emphasize that all our findings are not limited to GPS alone. The systematic
bias and all its implications are bound to occur in any movement data collected
with absolute positioning if interpolation error can be neglected.

dissemination (DD) in random wireless networks under the generalized physical
model (GphyM). This is truly not a new topic. Our motivation to readdress this
issue is two-fold: Firstly, we aim to propose a more general result to unify
the network capacity for general homogeneous random models by investigating the
impacts of different parameters of the system on the network capacity.
Secondly, we target to close the open gaps between the upper and the lower
bounds on the network capacity in the literature. The generality of this work
lies in three aspects: (1) We study the homogeneous random network of a general
node density $\lambda \in [1,n]$, rather than either random dense network (RDN,
$\lambda=n$) or random extended network (REN, $\lambda=1$) as in the
literature. (2) We address the general deterministic dissemination sessions,
\ie, the general multicast sessions, which unify the capacities for unicast and
broadcast sessions by setting the number of destinations for each session as a
general value $n_d\in[1,n]$. (3) We allow the number of sessions to change in
the range $n_s\in(1,n]$, instead of assuming that $n_s=\Theta(n)$ as in the
literature. We derive the general upper bounds on the capacity for the
arbitrary case of $(\lambda, n_d, n_s)$ by introducing the Poisson Boolean
model of continuum percolation, and prove that they are tight according to the
existing general lower bounds constructed in the literature.

whether comets are pristine planetesimals or collisionally evolved objects. We
investigate the collisional evolution experienced by the precursors of current
comet nuclei during the early stages of the Solar System, in the context of the
so-called ""Nice Model"". We consider two environments for the collisional
evolution: (1) the trans-planetary planetesimal disk, from the time of gas
removal until the disk was dispersed by the migration of the ice giants, and
(2) the dispersing disk during the time that the scattered disk was formed.
Simulations have been performed, using different methods in the two cases, to
find the number of destructive collisions typically experienced by a comet
nucleus of 2km radius. In the widely accepted scenario, where the dispersal of
the planetesimal disk occurred at the time of the Late Heavy Bombardment about
4Gy ago, comet-sized planetesimals have a very small chance to survive against
destructive collisions in the disk. On the extreme assumption that the disk was
dispersed directly upon gas removal, there is a chance for a significant
fraction of the planetesimals to remain intact. However, these survivors would
still bear the marks of many non-destructive impacts. Thus, the Nice Model of
Solar System evolution predicts that typical km-sized comet nuclei are
predominantly fragments resulting from collisions experienced by larger parent
bodies. An important goal for further research is to investigate, whether the
observed properties of comet nuclei are compatible with such a collisional
origin.

  Computing, in Monticello, IL, USA, Sep 2015",,"10.1109/ITWF.2015.7360762",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coding schemes for discrete memoryless multicast networks (DM-MN) with
rate-limited feedback from the receivers and relays to the transmitter are
proposed. The schemes improve over the noisy network coding proposed by Lim et
al.. For the single relay channel with relay-transmitter feedback, our coding
schemes recover Gabbai and Bross's results, and strictly improve on noisy
network coding, distributed decode-forward coding proposed by Lim et al., and
all known lower bounds on the achievable rates proposed for the setup without
feedback.
  The coding schemes are based on block-Markov coding, superposition coding,
sliding-window/backward decoding and hybrid relaying strategies. In our Scheme
1A, the relays and receivers use compress-forward strategy and send the
compression indices to the transmitter through the feedback pipes. After
obtaining the compression indices through feedback, the transmitter sends them
together with the source message. Each receiver uses backward decoding to
jointly decode the source message and all compression indices. Our Scheme 1B is
similar, except that here each relay not only uses compress forward to compress
its channel outputs, but also performs partial decode forward to decode a
common part of source message. Our Scheme 1C allows different relays to decode
different parts of the source message (in Scheme 1A, no relay decodes any part
of the source message; in Scheme 1B, all relays decode the same part of source
message), which can achieve higher rates than Scheme 1A and Scheme 1B.
  Motivated by the feedback coding scheme, we propose a new coding scheme for
DM-MN without feedback, where the transmitter decodes the compression indices
instead of obtaining them directly through feedback. It is shown that the
scheme still improves noisy network coding and distributed decode-forward
coding for some channels.

interstellar dust. Model galaxies selected at $850$ $\mu$m reside in dark
matter halos of mass $M_{\rm halo}\sim10^{11.5}-10^{12}$ $h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$,
independent of redshift (for $0.2\lesssim z\lesssim4$) or flux (for
$0.25\lesssim S_{850\mu\rm m}\lesssim4$ mJy). At $z\sim2.5$, the brightest
galaxies ($S_{850\mu\rm m}>4$ mJy) exhibit a correlation length of
$r_{0}=5.5_{-0.5}^{+0.3}$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, consistent with observations. We show
that these galaxies have descendants with stellar masses $M_{\star}\sim10^{11}$
$h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ occupying halos spanning a broad range in mass $M_{\rm
halo}\sim10^{12}-10^{14}$ $h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$. The FIR emissivity at shorter

again independent of redshift (for $0.5\lesssim z\lesssim5$). We compare our
predictions for the angular power spectrum of cosmic infra-red background
anisotropies at these wavelengths with observations, finding agreement to
within a factor of $\sim2$ over all scales and wavelengths, an improvement over
earlier versions of the model. Simulating images at $850$ $\mu$m, we show that
confusion effects boost the measured angular correlation function on all scales
by a factor of $\sim4$. This has important consequences, potentially leading to
inferred halo masses being overestimated by an order of magnitude.

potential in fields ranging from spintronics to quantum computation. In the
ongoing scientific effort to demonstrate controlled manipulation of their
electronic structure by external means, stoichiometric variation and surface
decoration are two effective approaches that have been followed. In ARPES
experiments, both approaches are seen to lead to electronic band structure
changes. Such approaches result in variations of the energy position of bulk
and surface-related features and the creation of two-dimensional electron
gases.The data presented here demonstrate that a third manipulation handle is
accessible by utilizing the amount of illumination a topological insulator
surface has been exposed to under typical experimental ARPES conditions. Our
results show that this new, third, knob acts on an equal footing with
stoichiometry and surface decoration as a modifier of the electronic band
structure, and that it is in continuous competition with the latter. The data
clearly point towards surface photovoltage and photo-induced desorption as the
physical phenomena behind modifications of the electronic band structure under
exposure to high-flux photons. We show that the interplay of these phenomena
can minimize and even eliminate the adsorbate-related surface band bending on
typical binary, ternary and quaternary Bi-based topological insulators.
Including the influence of the sample temperature, these data set up a
framework for the external control of the electronic band structure in
topological insulator compounds in an ARPES setting. Four external knobs are
available: bulk stoichiometry, surface decoration, temperature and photon
exposure. These knobs can be used in conjunction to tune the band energies near
the surface and consequently influence the topological properties of the
relevant electronic states.

lifetimes of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We focus on the cloud population
between the two main spiral arms in M51 (the inter-arm region) where cloud
destruction via shear and star formation feedback dominates over formation
processes. By monitoring the change in GMC number densities and properties from
one side of the inter-arm to the other, we estimate the lifetime as a fraction
of the inter-arm travel time. We find that GMC lifetimes in M51's inter-arm are
finite and short, 20 to 30 Myr. Such short lifetimes suggest that cloud
evolution is influenced by environment, in which processes can disrupt GMCs
after a few free-fall times. Over most of the region under investigation shear
appears to regulate the lifetime. As the shear timescale increases with
galactocentric radius, we expect cloud destruction to switch primarily to star
formation feedback at larger radii. We identify a transition from shear- to
feedback-dominated disruption through a change in the behavior of the GMC
number density. The signature suggests that shear is more efficient at
completely dispersing clouds, whereas feedback transforms the population, e.g.
by fragmenting high mass clouds into lower mass pieces. Compared to the
characteristic timescale for molecular hydrogen in M51, our short lifetimes
suggest that gas can remain molecular while clouds disperse and reassemble. We
propose that galaxy dynamics regulates the cycling of molecular material from
diffuse to bound (and ultimately star-forming) objects, contributing to long
observed molecular depletion times in normal disk galaxies. We also speculate
that, in more extreme environments such as elliptical galaxies and concentrated
galaxy centers, star formation can be suppressed when the shear timescale
becomes so short that some clouds can not survive to collapse and form stars.

that the somewhat higher expected disk temperatures in $\rho$ Oph play a direct
role in decreasing the CN abundance. Warmer dust temperatures contribute to
convert CN into less volatile forms. In such a young region, CN is no longer a

rotational evolution starting with a realistic range of initial rotation rates.
  Methods. We derive evolutionary tracks of X-ray radiation based on a
rotational evolution model for solar mass stars and the rotation-activity
relation. We compare these tracks to X-ray luminosity distributions of stars in
clusters with different ages.
  Results. We find agreement between the evolutionary tracks derived from
rotation and the X-ray luminosity distributions from observations. Depending on
the initial rotation rate, a star might remain at the X-ray saturation level
for very different time periods, approximately from 10 Myr to 300 Myr for slow
and fast rotators, respectively.
  Conclusions. Rotational evolution with a spread of initial conditions leads
to a particularly wide distribution of possible X-ray luminosities in the age
range of 20 to 500 Myrs, before rotational convergence and therefore X-ray
luminosity convergence sets in. This age range is crucial for the evolution of
young planetary atmospheres and may thus lead to very different planetary
evolution histories.

structure, feature learning and regression are integrated into one optimization
process, which leads to a more effective model for estimating scene
illumination. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a standard
dataset of RAW images. Preliminary experiments on images with spatially varying
illumination demonstrate the stability of the local illuminant estimation
ability of our CNN.

carried out by using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) coupled with
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and satellite imagery which in turn
reduced cost and time and increased the accuracy of the final outcome. The
layers of cloud cover, digital elevation model, artificial lights, precipitable
water vapor, aerosol optical thickness and wind speed were studied in the GIS
system. In conclusion of MCDA, the most suitable regions were found to be
located in a strip crossing from southwest to northeast including also a
diverted region in southeast of Turkey. These regions are thus our prime
candidate locations for future on-site testing. In addition to this major
outcome, this study has also been applied to locations of major observatories
sites. Since no goal is set for \textit{the best}, the results of this study is
limited with a list of positions. Therefore, the list has to be further
confirmed with on-site tests. A national funding has been awarded to produce a
prototype of an on-site test unit (to measure both astronomical and
meteorological parameters) which might be used in this list of locations.

excitations in a coaxial quantum well embedded in a core-multishell GaAs/AlGaAs
nanowire. The complex composition, the hexagonal cross section and the remote
doping of typical samples are explicitly included, and the free electron gas is
obtained by a DFT approach. Inelastic light scattering cross sections due to
charge and spin collective excitations belonging to quasi-1D and quasi-2D
states, which coexist in such radial heterostructures, are predicted in the
non-resonant approximation from a fully three-dimensional multi-subband TDDFT
formalism. We show that collective excitations can be classified in azimuthal,
radial and longitudinal excitations, according to the associated density
fluctuations, and we suggest that their character can be exposed by specific
spectral dispersion of inelastic light scattering along different planes of the
heterostructure.

Using Bennett clocking mechanism, information can propagate through an array of
strain-mediated multiferroic nanomagnets exploiting the dipolar coupling
between the magnets without having to physically interconnect them. Here we
perform a critical analysis of switching failures, i.e., error in information
propagation due to thermal fluctuations through a chain of such straintronic
devices. We solved stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation considering
room-temperature thermal perturbations and show that magnetization switching
may fail due to inherent magnetization dynamics accompanied by thermally
broadened switching delay distribution. Avenues available to circumvent such
issue are proposed.

imaginary forward scattering amplitude, which consequently vanishes at the
diffractive minima. We extended the model to arbitrarily large real parts in a
way that constraints from unitarity are satisfied. The resulting model is able
to describe elastic $pp$ scattering not only at the lower ISR energies but also
at $\sqrt{s}=$7~TeV in a statistically acceptable manner, both in the
diffractive cone and in the region of the first diffractive minimum. The total
cross-section as well as the differential cross-section of elastic
proton-proton scattering is predicted for the future LHC energies of
$\sqrt{s}=$13, 14, 15~TeV and also to 28~TeV. A non-trivial, significantly
non-exponential feature of the differential cross-section of elastic
proton-proton scattering is analyzed and the excitation function of the
non-exponential behavior is predicted. The excitation function of the shadow
profiles is discussed and related to saturation at small impact parameters.
