established for harmonic coordinates on polytopes in two and three dimensions.
First we derive interpolation error estimates over convex polygons that depend
on the geometric quality of the triangles in the constrained Delaunay
triangulation of the polygon. This characterization is sharp in the sense that
families of polygons with poor quality triangles in their constrained Delaunay
triangulations are shown to produce large error when interpolating a basic
quadratic function. Non-convex polygons exhibit a similar limitation: large
constrained Delaunay triangles caused by vertices approaching a non-adjacent
edge also lead to large interpolation error. While this relationship is
generalized to convex polyhedra in three dimensions, the possibility of sliver
tetrahedra in the constrained Delaunay triangulation prevent the analogous
estimate from sharply reflecting the actual interpolation error. Non-convex
polyhedra are shown to be fundamentally different through an example of a
family of polyhedra containing vertices which are arbitrarily close to
non-adjacent faces yet the interpolation error remains bounded.

estimated means and standard deviations from the selected studies are required
in order to obtain an overall estimate of the mean effect and its confidence
interval. If these quantities are not directly reported in the publications,
they need to must be estimated from other reported summary statistics, such as
the median, the minimum, the maximum, and quartiles. Methods: We propose a
simulation-based estimation approach using the Approximate Bayesian Computation
(ABC) technique for estimating mean and standard deviation based on various
sets of summary statistics found in published studies. We conduct a simulation
study to compare the proposed ABC method with the existing methods of Hozo et
al. (2005), Bland (2015), and Wan et al. (2014). Results: In the estimation of
the standard deviation, our ABC method performs best in skewed or heavy-tailed
distributions. The average relative error (ARE) approaches zero as sample size
increases. In the normal distribution, our ABC performs well. However, the Wan
et al. method is best since it is based on the normal distribution assumption.
When the distribution is skewed or heavy-tailed, the ARE of Wan et al. moves
away from zero even as sample size increases. In the estimation of the mean,
our ABC method is best since the AREs converge to zero. Conclusion: ABC is a
flexible method for estimating the study-specific mean and standard deviation
for meta-analysis, especially with underlying skewed or heavy-tailed
distributions. The ABC method can be applied using other reported summary
statistics such as the posterior mean and 95% credible interval when Bayesian
analysis has been employed.

that a correct PCO-based algorithm to compute scattering amplitudes must be
based on piecing together local descriptions. Recently, ""vertical integration""

adopted in several applications, such as encrypted storage or access control
systems. Recently, researchers argued about the non acceptable performance of
ABE when implemented on mobile devices. Indeed, the non feasibility of ABE on
mobile devices would hinder the deployment of novel protocols and
services--that could instead exploit the full potential of such devices.
However, we believe the conclusion of non usability was driven by a not-very
efficient implementation.
  In this paper, we want to shine a light on this concern by studying the
feasibility of applying ABE on smartphone devices. In particular, we
implemented AndrABEn, an ABE library for Android operating system. Our library
is written in the C language and implements two main ABE schemes:
Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption, and Key- Policy Attribute-Based
Encryption. We also run a thorough set of experimental evaluation for AndrABEn,
and compare it with the current state-of-the-art (considering the same
experimental setting). The results confirm the possibility to effectively use
ABE on smartphone devices, requiring an acceptable amount of resources in terms
of computations and energy consumption. Since the current state-of-the-art
claims the non feasibility of ABE on mobile devices, we believe that our study
(together with the AndrABEn library that we made available online) is a key
result that will pave the way for researchers and developers to design and

capacitated graph (directed or undirected), a sink node $t$ and a set of
demands that we want to send to the sink. Here demand $i$ is located at a node
$s_i$ and requests an amount $d_i$ of flow capacity in order to route
successfully. Two standard objectives are to maximise (i) the number of demands
(cardinality) and (ii) the total demand (throughput) that can be routed subject
to the capacity constraints. Furthermore, we examine these maximisation
problems for three specialised types of network flow: unsplittable, confluent
and priority flows.
  In the {\em unsplittable flow} problem (UFP), we have edge capacities, and
the demand for $s_i$ must be routed on a single path. In the {\em confluent
flow} problem, we have node capacities, and the final flow must induce a tree.
Both of these problems have been studied extensively, primarily in the
single-sink setting. However, most of this work imposed the {\em no-bottleneck
assumption} (that the maximum demand $d_{max}$ is at most the minimum capacity
$u_{min}$). Given the no-bottleneck assumption (NBA), there is a factor
$4.43$-approximation algorithm due to Dinitz et al. for the unsplittable flow
problem. Under the stronger assumption of uniform capacities, there is a factor
$3$-approximation algorithm due to Chen et al. for the confluent flow problem.
However, unlike the UFP, we show that a constant factor approximation algorithm
cannot be obtained for the single-sink confluent flows even {\bf with} the NBA.
  Without NBA, we show that maximum cardinality single-sink UFP is hard to
approximate to within a factor $n^{.5-\epsilon}$ even when all demands lie in a
small interval $[1,1+\Delta]$ where $\Delta>0$ (but has polynomial input size).
This is very sharp since when $\Delta=0$, this becomes a maximum flow problem.

covalently linked acene dimers. As in the acene crystals, singlet fission in
the polyenes is a multichromophoric phenomenon, with the well-known
2$^1$A$_g^-$ playing no direct role. Intermolecular charge-transfer is
essential for singlet fission in both acenes and polyenes, but because of
subtle differences in the natures and orderings of the aggregate excited
states, the mechanisms of singlet fission are slightly different in the two
classes. We are thus able to give qualitative physical reasoning for the slower
singlet fission in the polyenes, relative to that in crystalline pentacene. Our
work also gives new insight into the complex exciton dynamics in tetracene

demonstrates a novel active tractor beam for multiple fully immersed objects

3D trapping. Continuous and stable long distance levitation, controlled
rotation and 3D trapping are demonstrated with a single optical set-up by using
two coaxial, or even non-coaxial, superimposed non-diffracting higher order
Bessel beams of reverse helical nature and different frequencies. The
superimposed beam has periodic intensity variations both along and around the
beam-axis because of the difference in longitudinal wave-vectors and beam
orders, respectively. The difference in frequencies of two laser beams makes
the intensity pattern move along and around the beam-axis in a continuous way
without manual ramping of phase, which allows for either linear motion (forward
or backward) or angular movement (clockwise or anticlockwise) of fully immersed
multiple particles. As a major contribution, the condition for increasing the
target binding regions is also proposed to manipulate multiple immersed objects
of different sizes and shapes.

inefficient due to decaying power with distance, antenna polarization, etc.
Consequently, idle charging needs to be minimized to reduce already large costs
of providing energy to the receivers and at the same time reduce the carbon
footprint of WPTNs. In turn, energy saving in a WPTN can be boosted by simply
switching off the energy transmitter when the received energy is too weak for

two ""green"" protocols for the control plane of static charger/mobile receiver
WPTN aimed at optimizing the charger workflow to make WPTN green. Those
protocols are: 'beaconing', where receivers advertise their presence to WPTN,
and 'probing' exploiting the receiver feedback from WTPN on the level of
received energy. We demonstrate that both protocols reduce the unnecessary WTPN
uptime, however trading it for the reduced energy provision, compared to the
base case of 'WPTN charger always on'. For example, our system (in our
experiments) saves at most approx. 80% of energy and increases 5.5 times the
efficiency with only approx. 17% less energy possibly harvested.

relatively cold (17-21 K), while some local clumps have a dust temperature up
to 25-47 K. All the filaments are located within <~60 pc from the Galactic
mid-plane. Comparing the filaments to a recent spiral arm model incorporating
the latest parallax measurements, we find that 7/9 of them reside within arms,

the Galactic scale height and therefore are not simply part of a grander
turbulent cascade.

Its pulse times of arrival are well modeled by a comprehensive pulsar binary
model including its three-dimensional orbit and a noise model that incorporates
correlated noise such as jitter and red noise. Its timing residuals have
weighted root mean square $\sim 92$ ns. The new dataset allows us to update and
improve previous measurements of the system properties, including the masses of
the neutron star ($1.31\pm0.11$ $M_{\odot}$) and the companion white dwarf
($0.286\pm0.012$ $M_{\odot}$) and the parallax distance $1.15\pm0.03$ kpc. We
measured the intrinsic change in orbital period, $\dot{P}^{\rm Int}_{\rm b}$,
is $-0.20\pm0.17$ ps s$^{-1}$, which is not distinguishable from zero. This
result, combined with the measured $\dot{P}^{\rm Int}_{\rm b}$ of other
pulsars, can place a generic limit on potential changes in the gravitational
constant $G$. We found that $\dot{G}/G$ is consistent with zero
[$(-0.6\pm1.1)\times10^{-12}$ yr$^{-1}$, 95\% confidence] and changes at least
a factor of $31$ (99.7\% confidence) more slowly than the average expansion
rate of the Universe. This is the best $\dot{G}/G$ limit from pulsar binary
systems. The $\dot{P}^{\rm Int}_{\rm b}$ of pulsar binaries can also place
limits on the putative coupling constant for dipole gravitational radiation
$\kappa_D=(-0.9\pm3.3)\times10^{-4}$ (95\% confidence). Finally, the nearly
circular orbit of this pulsar binary allows us to constrain statistically the
strong-field post-Newtonian parameters $\Delta$, which describes the violation

breaking of both Lorentz invariance in gravitation and conservation of

(q->1) RSK correspondences (the latter ones are sometimes also called
tropical).
  For 0<q<1 our correspondences are randomized, i.e., the result of an
insertion is a certain probability distribution on semistandard Young tableaux.
Because of this randomness, we use the language of discrete time Markov
dynamics on two-dimensional interlacing particle arrays (these arrays are in a
natural bijection with semistandard tableaux). Our dynamics act nicely on a
certain class of probability measures on arrays, namely, on q-Whittaker
processes (which are t=0 versions of Macdonald processes). We present four
Markov dynamics which for q=0 reduce to the classical row or column RSK
correspondences applied to a random input matrix with independent geometric or
Bernoulli entries.
  Our new two-dimensional discrete time dynamics generalize and extend several
known constructions: (1) The discrete time q-TASEPs arise as one-dimensional
marginals of our ""column"" dynamics. In a similar way, our ""row"" dynamics lead
to discrete time q-PushTASEPs - new integrable particle systems in the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. We employ these new one-dimensional
discrete time systems to establish a Fredholm determinantal formula for the
two-sided continuous time q-PushASEP conjectured by Corwin-Petrov (2013). (2)
In a certain Poisson-type limit (from discrete to continuous time), our
two-dimensional dynamics reduce to the q-randomized column and row
Robinson-Schensted correspondences introduced by O'Connell-Pei (2012) and
Borodin-Petrov (2013), respectively. (3) In a scaling limit as q->1, two of our
four dynamics on interlacing arrays turn into the geometric RSK correspondences
associated with log-Gamma or strict-weak directed random polymers.

evolution of over 6000 subhalos in the Via Lactea II simulation, from infall to

lower mass subhalos, which are not strongly affected by dynamical friction,
exhibit behaviors qualitatively different from those found previously for more
massive ones. Furthermore, there is a clear trend of subhalos that fell into
the host earlier being less concentrated. We show that the concentration at
infall characterizes various aspects of subhalo evolution. In particular, tidal
effects truncate the growth of less concentrated subhalos at larger distances
from the host; subhalos with smaller concentrations have larger infall radii.
The concentration at infall is further shown to be a determining factor for the

for which we present new near-IR [Fe II] spectra obtained with the FIRE
spectrograph at Magellan Observatory. Earlier H{\alpha} and near-IR [Fe II]
imaging revealed that the two emission lines trace substantially different
morphologies in the inner ~40"" of the outflow. H{\alpha} traces a broad cocoon
that surrounds the collimated [Fe II] jet that extends throughout the parent
dust pillar. New spectra show that this discrepancy extends to their
kinematics. Near-IR [Fe II] emission traces steady, fast velocities of +/- 200
km/s from the eastern and western limbs of the jet. We compare this to a
previously published H{\alpha} spectrum that reveals a Hubble-flow velocity
structure near the jet-driving source. New, second-epoch HST/ACS H{\alpha}
images reveal the lateral spreading of the H{\alpha} outflow lobe away from the
jet axis. H{\alpha} proper motions also indicate a sudden increase in the
mass-loss rate ~1000 yr ago, while steady [Fe II] emission throughout the inner
jet suggests that the burst is ongoing. An accretion burst sustained for ~1000
yr is an order of magnitude longer than expected for FU Orionis outbursts, but
represents only a small fraction of the total age of the HH 666 outflow.
Altogether, available data suggests that [Fe II] traces the highly collimated
protostellar jet while H{\alpha} traces the entrained and irradiated outflow.
HH 666 appears to be a missing link between bare jets seen in H II regions and
entrained molecular outflows seen from embedded protostars in more quiescent
regions.

nonzero three-point correlation function, or bispectrum in Fourier space. Of
the several possibilities for this bispectrum, the most commmon is the
local-model bispectrum, which can be described as a spatial modulation of the
small-scale (large-wavenumber) power spectrum by long-wavelength density
fluctuations. While the local model predicts this spatial modulation to be
scale-independent, many variants have some scale-dependence. Here we note that
this scale dependence can be probed with measurements of frequency-spectrum
distortions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), in particular
highlighting Compton-$y$ distortions. Dissipation of primordial perturbations
with wavenumbers $50\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim 10^4\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$
give rise to chemical-potential ($\mu$) distortions, while those with
wavenumbers $1\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim 50\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ give
rise to Compton-$y$ distortions. With local-model non-Gaussianity, the
distortions induced by this dissipation can be distinguished from those due to
other sources via their cross-correlation with the CMB temperature $T$. We show
that the relative strengths of the $\mu T$ and $yT$ correlations thus probe the
scale-dependence of non-Gaussianity and estimate the magnitude of possible

When protogalaxies hosted by dark matter halos with a virial temperature of ~
10^4 K collide with a relative velocity > 200 km/s, the gas is shock-heated to
~ 10^6 K and subsequently cools isobarically via free-free emission and He^+,
He, and H line emission. Since the gas density (> 10^4 cm^{-3}) is high enough
to destroy H_2 molecules by collisional dissociation, the shocked gas never
cools below ~ 10^4 K. Once a gas cloud of ~ 10^5 Msun reaches this temperature,
it becomes gravitationally unstable and forms a SMS which will rapidly collapse
into a super massive black hole (SMBH) via general relativistic instability. We
perform a simple analytic estimate of the number density of direct-collapse

N-body simulations) and find n_{DCBH} ~ 10^{-9} Mpc^{-3} (comoving) by z = 10.

neutrinos on large scale structure. However, using Boltzmann codes to compute
the smoothed density contrast on Mpc scales, we find that dark matter halos
form abundantly for $m_\nu \gtrsim 10$ eV. This finding rules out an anthropic
origin of $m_\nu$, unless a different catastrophic boundary can be identified.
Here we argue that galaxy formation becomes inefficient for $m_\nu \gtrsim 10$

cluster scales, as in a top-down scenario. This is catastrophic: baryonic gas
will cool too slowly to form stars in an abundance comparable to our universe.

covering a range of stellar masses and compactness in a narrow redshift range
$\mathit{z \approx 1.0}$. This allows us to exclude systematic effects on the

affected previous studies. We confirm that mass discrepancy scales with galaxy
compactness. We use the stellar mass plane ($M_\star$, $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$,
$r_\mathrm{e}$) populated by our sample to constrain a generic evolution
mechanism. We find that the simulations of the growth of massive ellipticals

massive object comprises an important fundamental test of quantum theory. These
quantum states are extremely fragile and tend to quickly decay into incoherent
mixtures due to the environmental decoherence. Experimental setups considered
up to date address this threat in a conceptually straightforward way -- by
eliminating the environment, i.e. by isolating an object in a sufficiently high
vacuum. We show that another option exists: decoherence is suppressed in the
presence of a strongly interacting environment if this environment is
superfluid. Indeed, as long as an object immersed in a pure superfluid at zero
temperature moves with a velocity below the critical one, it does not create,
absorb or scatter any excitations of the superfluid. Hence, in this idealized
situations the decoherence is absent. In reality the decoherence will be
present due to thermal excitations of the superfluid and impurities
contaminating the superfluid. We examine various decoherence channels in the
superfluid $^4$He. It is shown that the total decoherence time can be as large
as tens of seconds for a $10^6$ amu nanoparticle delocalized over $300$ nm in

generalization relates the second eigenvalue to the edge expansion and the
vertex expansion of the graph G, $\lambda_2 = \Omega(\phi^V(G) \phi(G))$, where
$\phi^V(G)$ denotes the robust vertex expansion of G and $\phi(G)$ denotes the

the edge expansion and the expansion profile of G, for all $k \ge 2$,
$\lambda_2 = \Omega(\phi_k(G) \phi(G) / k)$, where $\phi_k(G)$ denotes the
k-way expansion of G. These show that the spectral partitioning algorithm has
better performance guarantees when $\phi^V(G)$ is large (e.g. planted random
instances) or $\phi_k(G)$ is large (instances with few disjoint non-expanding
sets). Both bounds are tight up to a constant factor.
  Our approach is based on a method to analyze solutions of Laplacian systems,
and this allows us to extend the results to local graph partitioning
algorithms. In particular, we show that our approach can be used to analyze
personal pagerank vectors, and to give a local graph partitioning algorithm for
the small-set expansion problem with performance guarantees similar to the
generalizations of Cheeger's inequality. We also present a spectral approach to
prove similar results for the truncated random walk algorithm. These show that
local graph partitioning algorithms almost match the performance of the
spectral partitioning algorithm, with the additional advantages that they apply
to the small-set expansion problem and their running time could be sublinear.
Our techniques provide common approaches to analyze the spectral partitioning
algorithm and local graph partitioning algorithms.

approximated by its conformal limit expression. At terrestrially accessible
energy scales, the twist-two and pseudoscalar twist-three PDAs differ
significantly from those functions commonly associated with their forms in
QCD's conformal limit. In all amplitudes studied, SU(3) flavour-symmetry
breaking is typically a 13% effect. This scale is determined by nonperturbative
dynamics; namely, the current-quark-mass dependence of dynamical chiral
symmetry breaking. The heavier-quark is favoured by this distortion, for
example, support is shifted to the s-quark in the negative kaon. It appears,
therefore, that at energy scales accessible with existing and foreseeable
facilities, one may obtain reliable expectations for experimental outcomes by
using these ""strongly dressed"" PDAs in formulae for hard exclusive processes.
Following this procedure, any discrepancies between experiment and theory will
be significantly smaller than those produced by using the conformal-limit PDAs.
Moreover, the magnitude of any disagreement will either be a better estimate of
higher-order, higher-twist effects or provide more realistic constraints on the
Standard Model.

  Because compact, oriented derived manifolds have virtual classes, this means
that proper, oriented $-2$-shifted symplectic derived $\mathbb C$-schemes have
virtual classes, in either homology or bordism. This is surprising, as
conventional algebro-geometric virtual cycle methods fail in this case. Our
virtual classes have half the expected dimension, and from purely complex

  Now derived moduli schemes of coherent sheaves on a Calabi-Yau 4-fold are
expected to be $-2$-shifted symplectic (this holds for stacks). We propose to
use our virtual classes to define new Donaldson-Thomas style invariants

important role in social interactions. Previous studies of email were largely
based on surveys and limited to relatively small populations of email users
within organizations. In this paper, we report results of a large-scale study
of more than 2 million users exchanging 16 billion emails over several months.
We quantitatively characterize the replying behavior in conversations within
pairs of users. In particular, we study the time it takes the user to reply to
a received message and the length of the reply sent. We consider a variety of
factors that affect the reply time and length, such as the stage of the
conversation, user demographics, and use of portable devices. In addition, we
study how increasing load affects emailing behavior. We find that as users
receive more email messages in a day, they reply to a smaller fraction of them,
using shorter replies. However, their responsiveness remains intact, and they
may even reply to emails faster. Finally, we predict the time to reply, length
of reply, and whether the reply ends a conversation. We demonstrate
considerable improvement over the baseline in all three prediction tasks,
showing the significant role that the factors that we uncover play, in
determining replying behavior. We rank these factors based on their predictive
power. Our findings have important implications for understanding human
behavior and designing better email management applications for tasks like
ranking unread emails.

that the shocks formed beyond 2 to 3 Rs. In one case, there was a metric type
II burst with low starting frequency indicating a shock formation height of
about 2 Rs. The FE-associated SEP events did have softer spectra (spectral

find a diminished role for flares and complex type III burst durations in these

past decade, at which rate the 2005 Congressional mandate to find 90% of 140m
NEAs will not be met before 2030. Meanwhile, characterization is falling
farther behind: Fewer than 10% of NEAs are well characterized in terms of size,
rotation periods, and spectra, and at current rates of follow-up it will take
about a century to determine them even for the known population. Over 60% of
NEAs have an orbital uncertainty parameter, U >= 4, making reacquisition more
than a year following discovery difficult; for H > 22 this fraction is over
90%. We argue that rapid follow-up will be essential to characterize
newly-discovered NEAs. Most new NEAs are found within 0.5mag of peak brightness
and fade quickly, typically by 0.5/3.5/5mag after 1/4/6 weeks. About 80% have
synodic periods of <3 years that bring them close to Earth several times a
decade. However, follow-up observations on subsequent apparitions will be near
impossible for the bulk of new discoveries, as these will be H > 22 NEAs that
tend to return 100 times fainter. We show that for characterization to keep
pace with discovery would require: Visible spectroscopy within days with a

a >4m telescope; and fast-cadence (<min) lightcurves obtained within days with

that the magnetized star would have the prolate and the large internal toroidal

the Lorentz force is a cross product of current density and magnetic field, the
prolate shaped configurations and the large toroidal magnetic fields in stars
require a special relation between current density and the Lorentz force. We
have analyzed simple analytical solutions and found that the prolate and the
toroidal dominant configuration require non force-free toroidal current density
that flows in the opposite direction with respect to the bulk current within
the star. Such current density results in the Lorentz force which makes the
stellar shape prolate. Satisfying this special relation between the current

sufficiently large (compared to the scale of inhomogeneities) and are averaged
over different directions on the sky. This presumption does not hold when
considering the effect of the gravitational redshift caused by our local
gravitational potential, which alters light coming from all distances and

gravitational redshift gives rise to noticeable effects in cosmological
inference using SN Ia data. Assuming conservative prior knowledge of the local
potential given by sampling a range of gravitational potentials at locations of

ignoring the gravitational redshift effect in a standard data analysis leads to

appear in four major polytypes depending on the stacking order, except for the

odd-number $\beta$-type GaS, GaSe, and InSe crystals are noncentrosymmetric.
The spin splittings of the UVB and the LCB near the $\Gamma$-point in the
Brillouin zone are finite, but still smaller than those in a zinc-blende
semiconductor such as GaAs. On the other hand, the spin splitting is zero in
centrosymmetric bulk and even-number few-layer $\beta$-type GaS, GaSe, and
InSe, owing to the constraint of spatial inversion symmetry. By contrast, GaTe
exhibits zero spin splitting because it is centrosymmetric down to a single
layer. In these monochalcogenide semiconductors, the separation of the
non-degenerate conduction and valence bands from adjacent bands results in the
suppression of Elliot-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism. Therefore, the electron-
and hole-spin relaxation times in these systems with zero or minimal spin
splittings are expected to exceed those in GaAs when the D'yakonov-Perel' spin
relaxation mechanism is also suppressed.

the context of finite difference is proposed. Depending on the smoothness of
the large stencil used in the reconstruction of the numerical flux, a parameter
$\theta$ is set adaptively to switch the scheme between a 5th-order upwind and
6th-order central discretization. A new indicator $\tau^{\theta}$ measuring the
smoothness of the large stencil is chosen among two candidates which are
devised based on the possible highest-order variations of the reconstruction
polynomials in $L^2$ sense. In addition, a new set of smoothness indicators
$\tilde{\beta}_k$'s of the sub-stencils is introduced. These are constructed in
a central sense with respect to the Taylor expansions around the point $x_{j}$.
  Numerical results show that the new scheme combines good properties of both

supernovae (SNe Ia). This lensing magnification allows for weak lensing
measurement independent of cosmic shear. It is free of shape measurement errors
associated with cosmic shear and can therefore be used to diagnose and
calibrate multiplicative error. Although this lensing magnification is
difficult to measure accurately in auto correlation, its cross correlation with
cosmic shear and galaxy distribution in overlapping area can be measured to
significantly higher accuracy. Therefore these cross correlations can put
useful constraint on multiplicative error, and the obtained constraint is free
of cosmic variance in weak lensing field. We present two methods implementing
this idea and estimate their performances. We find that, with $\sim 1$ million
SNe Ia that can be achieved by the proposed D2k survey with the LSST telescope
(Zhan et al. 2008), multiplicative error of $\sim 0.5\%$ for source galaxies at
$z_s\sim 1$ can be detected and larger multiplicative error can be corrected to
the level of $0.5\%$. It is therefore a promising approach to control the
multiplicative to the sub-percent level required for stage IV projects. The
combination of the two methods even has the potential to diagnose and calibrate
galaxy intrinsic alignment, which is another major systematic error in cosmic

topological insulators, and its band structure--two conical bands touching at a
single point--has also been realized for photons in waveguide arrays, atoms in
optical lattices, and through accidental degeneracy. Deformations of the Dirac
cone often reveal intriguing properties; an example is the quantum Hall effect,
where a constant magnetic field breaks the Dirac cone into isolated Landau
levels. A seemingly unrelated phenomenon is the exceptional point, also known
as the parity-time symmetry breaking point, where two resonances coincide in
both their positions and widths. Exceptional points lead to counter-intuitive
phenomena such as loss-induced transparency, unidirectional transmission or
reflection, and lasers with reversed pump dependence or single-mode operation.
These two fields of research are in fact connected: here we discover the
ability of a Dirac cone to evolve into a ring of exceptional points, which we
call an ""exceptional ring."" We experimentally demonstrate this concept in a
photonic crystal slab. Angle-resolved reflection measurements of the photonic
crystal slab reveal that the peaks of reflectivity follow the conical band
structure of a Dirac cone from accidental degeneracy, whereas the complex
eigenvalues of the system are deformed into a two-dimensional flat band
enclosed by an exceptional ring. This deformation arises from the dissimilar
radiation rates of dipole and quadrupole resonances, which play a role
analogous to the loss and gain in parity-time symmetric systems. Our results
indicate that the radiation that exists in any open system can fundamentally
alter its physical properties in ways previously expected only in the presence
of material loss and gain.

faithfully preserve the intrinsic structures of data, where the intrinsic
structures are estimated using all the input features of data. However, the
estimated intrinsic structures are unreliable/inaccurate when the redundant and
noisy features are not removed. Therefore, we face a dilemma here: one need the
true structures of data to identify the informative features, and one need the
informative features to accurately estimate the true structures of data. To
address this, we propose a unified learning framework which performs structure
learning and feature selection simultaneously. The structures are adaptively
learned from the results of feature selection, and the informative features are
reselected to preserve the refined structures of data. By leveraging the
interactions between these two essential tasks, we are able to capture accurate

periodic isometric immersions of hyperbolic surfaces in the small slope regime.
We extend these solutions to exact isometric immersions through resummation of
a formal asymptotic expansion. In the disc geometry we construct self-similar
fractal-like isometric immersions for disks with constant negative curvature.
The solutions in both the strip and disc geometry qualitatively resemble the
patterns observed experimentally and numerically in torn elastic sheets, leaves

patterns are thus possible within the class of finite bending energy isometric

two-point correlation function as a function of angle, $\xi(\mu)$, is measured
at different redshifts. Assuming an incorrect cosmological model to convert
galaxy redshifts to distances, the shape of $\xi(\mu)$ appears anisotropic due
to the AP effect, and the amplitude shifted by the change in comoving volume.
Due to the redshift dependence of the AP and volume effect, both the shape and
amplitude of $\xi(\mu)$ exhibit redshift dependence. Similar to Li et.al
(2014), we find the redshift-space distortions (RSD) caused by galaxy peculiar
velocities, although significantly distorts $\xi(\mu)$, exhibit much less
redshift evolution compared to the AP and volume effects. By focusing on the
redshift dependence of $\xi(\mu)$, we can correctly recover the cosmological
parameters despite the contamination of RSD. The method is tested by using the
Horizon Run 3 N-body simulation, from which we made a series of $1/8$-sky mock
surveys having 8 million physically self-bound halos and sampled to have
roughly a uniform number density in $z=0-1.5$. We find the AP effect results in
tight, unbiased constraints on the density parameter and dark energy equation
of state, with 68.3% CL intervals $\delta \Omega_m\sim0.03$ and $\delta
w\sim0.1$, and the volume effect leads to much tighter constraints of $\delta

transition strength densities, we have derived formulas for lower order
bivariate moments of the strength densities generated by a variety of

representation for Hamiltonian and an independent EGUE($t$) representation for

derived, for the first time, for the transition strength densities. Formulas

Aluminum ZMWs are important structures thanks to their commercial availability

the lower losses of aluminum in the green spectral region provide larger
fluorescence brightness enhancement factors. For both aluminum and gold ZMWs,

players in o(n)-time, and minimize the damage to the rest of the players. All
currently known algorithms require Omega(n)-time, even when assigning a portion
to just one player, and it is nontrivial to revise these algorithms to run in
$o(n)$-time since many of the remaining players, who have not been asked any
queries, may not be satisfied with the remaining cake. To challenge this
problem, we begin by providing a framework for solving the cake-cutting problem
in sublinear-time. Generally speaking, solving a problem in sublinear-time
requires the use of approximations. However, in our framework, we introduce the
concept of ""eps n-victims,"" which means that eps n players (victims) may not
get fair portions, where 0< eps =< 1 is an arbitrary constant. In our
framework, an algorithm consists of the following two parts: In the first
(Preassigning) part, it distributes fair portions to r < n players in
o(n)-time. In the second (Completion) part, it distributes fair portions to the
remaining n-r players except for the eps n victims in poly}(n)-time. There are
two variations on the r players in the first part. Specifically, whether they
can or cannot be designated. We will then present algorithms in this framework.
In particular, an O(r/eps)-time algorithm for r =< eps n/127 undesignated
players with eps n-victims, and an O~(r^2/eps)-time algorithm for r =< eps
e^{{sqrt{ln{n}}}/{7}} designated players and eps =< 1/e with eps n-victims are
presented.

recently acquired knowledge on wire packing in rigid spheres breaks down. We
find that unlike in rigid cavities, friction plays a key role by giving rise to
the emergence of two distinct packing patterns. At low friction, the wire
densely coils into an ordered toroidal bundle with semi-ellipsoidal
cross-section, while at high friction, it packs into a highly disordered,
hierarchic structure. These two morphologies are shown to be separated by a
continuous phase transition. Our findings demonstrate the dramatic impact of

Rule-of-Thumb (ExROT) for bandwidth selection in Kernel Density Estimation
(KDE). There are existing various bandwidth selection rules achieving
minimization of the Asymptotic Mean Integrated Square Error (AMISE) between the
estimated probability density function (PDF) and the actual PDF. The rules
differ in a way to estimate the integration of the squared second order
derivative of an unknown PDF $(f(\cdot))$, identified as the roughness
$R(f''(\cdot))$. The simplest Rule-of-Thumb (ROT) estimates $R(f''(\cdot))$
with an assumption that the density being estimated is Gaussian. Intuitively,
better estimation of $R(f''(\cdot))$ and consequently better bandwidth
selection rules can be derived, if the unknown PDF is approximated through an
infinite series expansion based on a more generalized density assumption. As a
demonstration and verification to this concept, the ExROT derived in the
article uses an extended assumption that the density being estimated is near
Gaussian. This helps use of the GCA expansion as an approximation to the
unknown near Gaussian PDF. The ExROT for univariate KDE is extended to that for
multivariate KDE. The required multivariate AMISE criteria is re-derived using
elementary calculus of several variables, instead of Tensor calculus. The
derivation uses the Kronecker product and the vector differential operator to
achieve the AMISE expression in vector notations. There is also derived ExROT
for kernel based density derivative estimator.

Periodicity detection hinges on the estimation of the false alarm probability
(FAP) of the extremum of the periodogram of the time series. We consider the
problem of its estimation with two main issues in mind. First, for a given
number of observations and signal-to-noise ratio, the rate of correct
periodicity detections should be constant for all realized cadences of
observations regardless of the observational time patterns, in order to avoid
sky biases that are difficult to assess. Second, the computational loads should
be kept feasible even for millions of time series. Using the Gaia case, we
compare the $F^M$ method (Paltani 2004, Schwarzenberg-Czerny 2012), the Baluev
method (Baluev 2008) and the GEV method (S\""uveges 2014), as well as a method
for the direct estimation of a threshold. Three methods involve some unknown
parameters, which are obtained by fitting a regression-type predictive model
using easily obtainable covariates derived from observational time series. We
conclude that the GEV and the Baluev methods both provide good solutions to the
issues posed by a large-scale processing. The first of these yields the best
scientific quality at the price of some moderately costly pre-processing. When
this pre-processing is impossible for some reason (e.g. the computational costs
are prohibitive or good regression models cannot be constructed), the Baluev
method provides a computationally inexpensive alternative with slight biases in
regions where time samplings exhibit strong aliases.

density operators of boundary driven locally interacting quantum chains, where
driving is implemented via Markovian dissipation channels attached to the
chain's ends. We discuss explicit solutions in three different classes of
quantum chains, specifically, the paradigmatic (anisotropic) Heisenberg
spin-1/2 chain, the Fermi-Hubbard chain, and the Lai-Sutherland spin-1 chain,
and discuss universal concepts which characterize these solutions, such as
matrix product ansatz and a more structured walking graph state ansatz. The
central theme is the connection between the matrix product form of
nonequilibrium states and the integrability structures of the bulk Hamiltonian,
such as the Lax operators and the Yang-Baxter equation.
  However, there is a remarkable distinction with respect to the conventional
quantum inverse scattering method, namely addressing nonequilibrium steady
state density operators requires non-unitary irreducible representations of
Yang-Baxter algebra which are typically of infinite dimensionality. Such
constructions result in non-Hermitian, and often also non-diagonalisable
families of commuting transfer operators which in turn result in novel
conservation laws of the integrable bulk Hamiltonians. For example, in the case
of anisotropic Heisenberg model, quasi-local conserved operators which are odd
under spin reversal (or spin flip) can be constructed, whereas the conserved
operators stemming from orthodox Hermitian transfer operators (via logarithmic
differentiation) are all even under spin reversal.

novel techniques: key splitting and local load estimation. In so doing, it
achieves better load balancing than key grouping while being more scalable than
shuffle grouping. We test PKG on several large datasets, both real-world and

using on-board sensors or external instruments. These direct methods have in
turn guided studies of software techniques to reduce energy consumption via

hampered by the low power sampling frequency of power sensors. The coarse
granularity of power sensing limits our understanding of how power is allocated
in systems and our ability to optimize energy efficiency via workload
allocation.
  We present ALEA, a tool to measure power and energy consumption at the

  Node Placement in Wireless Sensor Networks","11 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Delay Constrained Relay Node Placement (DCRNP) problem in Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSNs) aims to deploy minimum relay nodes such that for each sensor
node there is a path connecting this sensor node to the sink without violating
delay constraint. As WSNs are gradually employed in time-critical applications,
the importance of the DCRNP problem becomes noticeable. For the NP-hard nature
of DCRNP problem, an approximation algorithm-Set-Covering-based Relay Node
Placement (SCA) is proposed to solve the DCRNP problem in this paper. The
proposed SCA algorithm deploys relay nodes iteratively from sink to the given
sensor nodes in hops, i.e., in the $k$th iteration SCA deploys relay nodes at
the locations that are $k$ hops apart from the sink. Specifically, in each
iteration, SCA first finds the candidate deployment locations located within 1
hop to the relay nodes and sensor nodes, which have already been connected to
the sink. Then, a subset of these candidate deployment locations, which can
guarantee the existence of paths connecting unconnected sensor nodes to the
sink within delay constraint, is selected to deploy relay nodes based on the
set covering method. As the iteration of SCA algorithm, the sensor nodes are
gradually connected to the sink with satisfying delay constraint.
  The elaborated analysis of the approximation ratio of SCA algorithm is given
out, and we also prove that the SCA is a polynomial time algorithm through
rigorous time complexity analysis. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
SCA algorithm, extensive simulations are implemented, and the simulation
results show that the SCA algorithm can significantly save the deployed relay
nodes comparing to the existing algorithms, i.e., at most 31.48% deployed relay
nodes can be saved due to SCA algorithm.

Continuous photometric observations, with the cadence of typically a day to one
week, were acquired with the 1-2m class telescopes in the LCOGT network, ARIES
telescopes in India and various other telescopes around the globe. The light
curve and spectra suggest that the SN is a normal type IIP event with a plateau
duration of $ \sim80 $ days with mid plateau absolute visual magnitude of
-16.7, although with a steeper decline during the plateau (0.92 mag 100 d$

The velocity profile of SN 2013ab shows striking resemblance with those of SNe
1999em and 2012aw. Following the Rabinak & Waxman (2011) prescription, the
initial temperature evolution of the SN emission allows us to estimate the

roll parameter $\epsilon$ depends on $\xi$, reaching maximally $\epsilon=2$

results are found in the Einstein frame (E), with $H_E=1/(\epsilon_E t)$, but
now $\epsilon_E \rightarrow 4/3$ as $\xi\rightarrow -\infty$. Therefore in the
presence of a nonminimally coupled scalar de Sitter is not any more an
attractor, but instead (when $\xi<-1/2$) the Universe settles in a decelerating

factor >2 on timescales of hours to days in 5 sources. One of these flaring
sources, OHC-E, has been detected for the first time. We conclude that the
radio emission arises from: i) highly-variable non-thermal gyrosynchrotron
emission produced by electrons accelerated in the magnetospheres of pre-main
sequence stars; ii) thermal emission from ionized gas and/or heated dust around
massive objects and proplyds. Combining our sample with other radio monitoring
and a X-ray catalog, we have studied the properties of 51 radio/X-ray stars. We
have found severals hints of a direct relation between the X-ray activity and
the mechanisms responsible for (at least some fraction of) the radio emission.
We have estimated a radio flaring rate of 0.14 flares day-1 in the densest

CO and its isotopes $^{13}$CO(2-1) and C$^{18}$O(2-1), together with the dense
gas tracers, HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0). A systematic study of the observed peak
temperatures with non-LTE equilibrium simulations shows that the detected lines
trace dense regions with n$_{H_2}$ in the range 2.5 $10^4 - 5.6 10^5$

10$^{-2}$. This is compatible with the dust mass derived from the far-infrared
emission, assuming a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01 with a typical clump size
of 2 pc. We also show that the gas is optically thin in all lines except for
$^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(2-1), CO lines are close to their thermal
equilibrium condition at 17.5-20 K, the molecular hydrogen density is larger
than critical and HCN and HCO+ lines have a subthermal excitation temperature
of 9 K with a density smaller than critical. The average $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO
line ratio is high (~21), and close to the $^{12}$CO/C$^{18}$O ratio (~30) that

  couple-stresses and complete traction boundary conditions",,,,,"math-ph math.AP math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we venture a new look at the linear isotropic indeterminate
couple stress model in the general framework of second gradient elasticity and
we propose a new alternative formulation which obeys Cauchy-Boltzmann's axiom
of the symmetry of the force stress tensor. For this model we prove the
existence of solutions for the equilibrium problem. Relations with other
gradient elastic theories and the possibility to switch from a {4th order}
(gradient elastic) problem to a 2nd order micromorphic model are also discussed
with a view of obtaining symmetric force-stress tensors. It is shown that the
indeterminate couple stress model can be written entirely with symmetric
force-stress and symmetric couple-stress. The difference of the alternative
models rests in specifying traction boundary conditions of either rotational
type or strain type. If rotational type boundary conditions are used in the
partial integration, the classical anti-symmetric nonlocal force stress tensor
formulation is obtained. Otherwise, the difference in both formulations is only
a divergence--free second order stress field such that the field equations are
the same, but the traction boundary conditions are different. For these results
we employ a novel integrability condition, connecting the infinitesimal
continuum rotation and the infinitesimal continuum strain. Moreover, we provide
the complete, consistent traction boundary conditions for both models.

different species of dark matter particles that separately couple to the two

internal $U(1)$ vector field, and some effective composite metric built out of
the two metrics. Among possible models only certain classes of kinetic and
interaction terms are allowed without invoking ghost degrees of freedom. Along
these lines we explore the number of allowed kinetic terms in the theory and
point out the presence of ghosts in a previous model. Finally, we propose a
promising class of ghost-free candidate theories that could provide the MOND
phenomenology at galactic scales while reproducing the standard cold dark
matter (CDM) model at cosmological scales.

27-day variation of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity in the period of
1995-1997 (Apos) than in 1985-1987 (Aneg). Subsequently, different ranges of
the heliolongitudinal asymmetry of the solar wind speed jointly with equally
important corresponding drift effect are general causes of the polarity
dependence of the amplitudes of the 27-day variation of the GCR intensity. At
the same time, we show that the polarity dependence is feeble for the last
unusual minimum epoch of solar activity 2007-2009 (Aneg); the amplitude of the
27-day variation of the GCR intensity shows only a tendency of the polarity
dependence. We present a three dimensional (3-D) model of the 27-day variation
of GCR based on the Parkers transport equation. In the 3-D model is implemented
a longitudinal variation of the solar wind speed reproducing in situ
measurements and corresponding divergence-free interplanetary magnetic field
(IMF) derived from the Maxwells equations. We show that results of the proposed
3-D modeling of the 27-day variation of GCR intensity for different polarities
of the solar magnetic cycle are in good agreement with the neutron monitors

allow large-scale simulations. The Gillespie algorithm can be used for fast
simulation of stochastic processes, and variants of it have been applied to
simulate dynamical processes on static networks. However, its adaptation to
temporal networks remains non-trivial. We here present a temporal Gillespie
algorithm that solves this problem. Our method is applicable to general Poisson
(constant-rate) processes on temporal networks, stochastically exact, and up to
multiple orders of magnitude faster than traditional simulation schemes based
on rejection sampling. We also show how it can be extended to simulate
non-Markovian processes. The algorithm is easily applicable in practice, and as
an illustration we detail how to simulate both Poissonian and non-Markovian
models of epidemic spreading. Namely, we provide pseudocode and its
implementation in C++ for simulating the paradigmatic
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered models and
a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with non-constant recovery rates. For
empirical networks, the temporal Gillespie algorithm is here typically from 10

measured more than once. The main goal of the stroboscopic tomography is to
determine when one can reconstruct the initial density matrix $\rho(0)$ on the

assuming a viable power-law $f(T)$ and shape function models. For the first

other is for $f(T)$ gravity. The normal matter violates the weak energy
condition for first case while there exist a possibility for micro physically
acceptable wormhole solution. There exist a physically acceptable wormhole
solution for the power-law $b(r)$ model. Also, we check the equilibrium

optimal play involves choosing bids from some probability distribution that
will guarantee a minimum probability of winning. In this manner, all-pay
bidding games wed the underlying concepts of economic and combinatorial games.
We present several results on the structures of optimal strategies in these

small nonadsorbing dissolved polymers create a depletion attraction, we
introduce an effective colloid-colloid potential closely related to the
Asakura-Oosawa model but that does not have any discontinuities. In
simulations, this model straightforwardly allows the calculation of the
pressure from the Virial formula, and the phase transition in the bulk from the
liquid to crystalline solid can be accurately located from a study where a
stable coexistence of a crystalline slab with a surrounding liquid phase
occurs. For this model, crystalline nuclei surrounded by fluid are studied both
by identifying the crystal-fluid interface on the particle level (using
suitable bond orientational order parameters to distinguish the phases) and by
""thermodynamic"" means. I.e., the latter method amounts to compute the
enhancement of chemical potential and pressure relative to their coexistence
values. We show that the chemical potential can be obtained from simulating
thick films, where one wall with a rather long range repulsion is present,
since near this wall the Widom particle insertion method works, exploiting the
fact that the chemical potential in the system is homogeneous. Finally, the
surface excess free energy of the nucleus is obtained, for a wide range of
nuclei volumes. From this method, it is established that classical nucleation
theory works, showing that for the present model the anisotropy of the
interface excess free energy of crystals and their resulting nonspherical shape
has only a very small effect on the barrier.
