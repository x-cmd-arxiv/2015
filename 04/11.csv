exchange of weak gauge bosons, charged leptons and quarks can mediate a
coupling to the photon field beyond tree level. Inside a relativistically
strong laser field nonlinear effects in the laser amplitude can play an
important role, as electrons and positrons interact nonperturbatively with the
coherent part of the photon field. Here, we calculate for the first time the
leading-order contribution to the axial-vector--vector current-coupling tensor
inside an arbitrary plane-wave laser field (which is taken into account exactly
by employing the Furry picture). The current-coupling tensor appears in the
calculation of various electroweak processes inside strong laser fields like
photon emission or trident electron-positron pair production by a neutrino.
Moreover, as we will see below, the axial-vector--vector current-coupling
tensor contains the Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly. This occurrence renders
the current-coupling tensor also interesting from a fundamental point of view,
as it is the simplest Feynman diagram in an external field featuring this kind
of anomaly.

and Seyferts using near-IR IFS. This study extends to the near-IR the
well-known optical and mid-IR emission line diagnostics used to classify
activity in galaxies. Based on the spatially resolved spectroscopy of
prototypes, we identify in the [FeII]1.64/Br$\gamma$ - H_2 1-0S(1)/Br$\gamma$
plane regions dominated by the different heating sources, i.e. AGNs, young MS
massive stars, and evolved stars i.e. supernovae. The ISM in LIRGs occupy a
wide region in the near-IR diagnostic plane from -0.6 to +1.5 and from -1.2 to
+0.8 (in log units) for the [FeII]/Br$\gamma$ and H_2/Br$\gamma$ line ratios,
respectively. The corresponding median(mode) ratios are +0.18(0.16) and
+0.02(-0.04). Seyferts show on average larger values by factors ~2.5 and ~1.4
for the [FeII]/Br$\gamma$ and H_2/Br$\gamma$ ratios, respectively. New areas
and relations in the near-IR diagnostic plane are defined for the compact, high
surface brightness regions dominated by AGN, young ionizing stars, and SNe
explosions, respectively. In addition, the diffuse regions affected by the AGN
radiation field cover an area similar to that of Seyferts, but with high values
in [FeII]/Br$\gamma$ that are not as extreme. The extended, non-AGN diffuse
regions cover a wide area in the diagnostic diagram that overlaps that of
individual excitation mechanisms (i.e. AGN, young stars, and SNe), but with its
mode value to that of the young SF clumps. This indicates that the excitation
conditions of the diffuse ISM are likely due to a mixture of the different
ionization sources. The integrated line ratios in LIRGs show higher excitation
conditions i.e. towards AGNs, than those measured by the spatially resolved
spectroscopy. If this behaviour is representative, it would have clear
consequences when classifying high-z, SF galaxies based on their near-IR
integrated spectra.

its reflectivity for $\lambda <$ 0.5 $\mu$m, producing baseline decreases of
$\sim$ 20% in a clear atmosphere and $\sim$ 10% in a hazy atmosphere. Here we
present the first radiation transfer algorithm that includes both polarization
and Raman scattering and facilitates computation of spatially resolved spectra.
New calculations show that Cochran and Trafton's (1978, Astrophys. J. 219,
756-762) suggestion that light reflected in the deep CH$_4$ bands is mainly
Raman scattered is not valid for current estimates of the CH$_4$vertical
distribution, which implies only a 4% Raman contribution. Comparisons with IUE,
HST, and groundbased observations confirm that high altitude haze absorption is
reducing Neptune's geometric albedo by $\sim$6% in the 0.22-0.26 $\mu$m range
and by $\sim$13% in the 0.35-0.45 $\mu$m range. We used accurate calculations
to evaluate several approximations of Raman scattering. The Karkoschka (1994,
Icarus 111, 174-192) method of removing Raman effects from observed spectra is
shown to have limited applicability and to undercorrect the depths of weak
CH$_4$ absorption bands. The Wallace (1972, Astrophys. J. 176, 249-257)
approximation produces geometric albedo values $\sim$5% low as originally
proposed, but can be much improved by adding scattering contributions from the
vibrational transition. The Pollack et al. (1986, Icarus 65, 442-466)
approximation is inaccurate and unstable, but can also be improved greatly by
several simple modifications. A new approximation provides low errors for
zenith angles below 70\deg in a clear atmosphere, although intermediate clouds
present problems at longer wavelengths.

for all models the Replica Symmetric (RS) phase is the region determined by the

that the conjectured phase boundary is exactly the phase boundary in the plane

protoplanetary disk seen edge on around an A star, Gomez's Hamburger (GoHam),
using VISIR at the Very Large Telescope. A compact region situated at a
projected distance of $350\pm50$ AU south of the central star is found to have
a reduced emission.This asymmetry is fully consistent with the presence of a
cold density structure, or clump, identified in earlier CO observations, and we
derive physical characteristics consistent with those observations: a mass of
0.8-11.4 Jupiter masses (for a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01), a radius of
about 10$^2$ astronomical units, and a local density of about $10^{7}$

on jammed static configurations of frictional ellipsoids, obtained by

conclusions that a ``perfect liquid'' is formed in heavy ion collisions at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). However, conventional $v_2$ methods
based on one-dimensional (1D) azimuth correlations give inconsistent results

inconsistent with hydrodynamic interpretations. In this study we distinguish
several components of 2D angular correlations and isolate a nonjet (NJ) azimuth
quadrupole denoted by $v_2\{\text{2D}\}$. We establish systematic variations of
the NJ quadrupole on $y_t$, centrality and collision energy. We adopt
transverse rapidity $y_t$ as both a velocity measure and as a logarithmic
alternative to transverse momentum $p_t$. Based on NJ quadrupole trends we
derive a completely factorized universal parametrization of quantity
$v_2\{\text{2D}\}(y_t,b,\sqrt{s_{NN}})$ which describes the centrality, $y_t$
and energy dependence. From $y_t$-differential $v_2(y_t)$ data we isolate a
quadrupole spectrum and infer a quadrupole source boost having unexpected
properties. NJ quadrupole $v_2$ trends obtained with 2D model fits are
remarkably simple. The centrality trend appear to be uncorrelated with a sharp
transition in jet-related structure that may indicate rapid change of Au-Au
medium properties. The lack of correspondence suggests that the NJ quadrupole
may be insensitive to such a medium. Several quadrupole trends have interesting
implications for hydro interpretations.

of WPV3-associated paralysis in Nigeria in November 2012. At the time of
writing, the most recent case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Nigeria
occurred in July 2014, and WPV1 has not been seen in Africa since a case in
Somalia in August 2014. No cases associated with circulating vaccine-derived
type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2) have been detected in Nigeria since November 2014.
Has WPV1 been eliminated from Africa? Has WPV3 been eradicated globally? Has
Nigeria interrupted cVDPV2 transmission? These questions are difficult because
polio surveillance is based on paralysis and paralysis only occurs in a small
fraction of infections.
  This report provides estimates for the probabilities of poliovirus
elimination in Nigeria given available data as of March 31, 2015. It is based
on a model of disease transmission that is built from historical polio
incidence rates and is designed to represent the uncertainties in transmission
dynamics and poliovirus detection that are fundamental to interpreting long
time periods without cases.
  The model estimates that, as of March 31, 2015, the probability of WPV1
elimination in Nigeria is 84%, and that if WPV1 has not been eliminated, a new
case will be detected with 99% probability by the end of 2015. The probability
of WPV3 elimination (and thus global eradication) is >99%. However, it is
unlikely that the ongoing transmission of cVDPV2 has been interrupted; the
probability of cVDPV2 elimination rises to 83% if no new cases are detected by
April 2016.
  Added July 10, 2015: On June 26, a cVDPV2 case was confirmed by the Global
Polio Laboratory Network. The date of paralysis was May 16. The case provides
new information about cVDPV2 prevalence that is useful for assessing the
accuracy of previous predictions and informing an updated forecast for the time
to cVDPV2 elimination.

by combining the use of deep brain stimulation and L-DOPA medication. We
develop two main feature-based representations of such signals, which are
obtained by considering (i) the long-term correlations and multifractal
properties, and (ii) the power spectra. The feature-based representations are
initially utilized for the purpose of characterizing the subjects under
different settings. In agreement with previous studies, we show that deep brain
stimulation does not significantly characterize neither of the two groups,

effect yields statistically significant differences in both high- and

three different classification problems, involving the recognition of (i) the

show that the use of medication can be discriminated with higher accuracy,

such as Mount Wilson and McIntosh have been effective in relating an active
region large scale magnetic configuration to its ability to produce eruptive
events. However, their qualitative nature prevents systematic studies of an
active region's evolution for example. We introduce a new clustering of active
regions that is based on the local geometry observed in Line of Sight
magnetogram and continuum images. We use a reduced-dimension representation of
an active region that is obtained by factoring the corresponding data matrix
comprised of local image patches. Two factorizations can be compared via the
definition of appropriate metrics on the resulting factors. The distances
obtained from these metrics are then used to cluster the active regions. We
find that these metrics result in natural clusterings of active regions. The
clusterings are related to large scale descriptors of an active region such as
its size, its local magnetic field distribution, and its complexity as measured
by the Mount Wilson classification scheme. We also find that including data
focused on the neutral line of an active region can result in an increased
correspondence between our clustering results and other active region
descriptors such as the Mount Wilson classifications and the $R$ value. We
provide some recommendations for which metrics, matrix factorization
techniques, and regions of interest to use to study active regions.

misclassifications and their effects are critical. However, if no problem
specific cost function is defined, there are no established measures to assess
the performance of such classifiers. We introduce a set of desired properties
for performance measures for classifiers with rejection, based on which we
propose a set of three performance measures for the evaluation of the
performance of classifiers with rejection that satisfy the desired properties.
The nonrejected accuracy measures the ability of the classifier to accurately
classify nonrejected samples; the classification quality measures the correct
decision making of the classifier with rejector; and the rejection quality
measures the ability to concentrate all misclassified samples onto the set of
rejected samples. From the measures, we derive the concept of relative
optimality that allows us to connect the measures to a family of cost functions
that take into account the trade-off between rejection and misclassification.
We illustrate the use of the proposed performance measures on classifiers with
rejection applied to synthetic and real-world data.

quadruple system formed by two widely separated binaries of pre-main-sequence
(PMS) stars: ABDor A/C and ABDor Ba/Bb. The pair ABDor A/C has been extensively
studied and its dynamical masses have been determined with high precision, thus
making of ABDor C a benchmark for calibrating PMS stellar models. If the orbit
and dynamical masses of the pair ABDor Ba/Bb can be determined, they could not
only play a similar role to that of ABDor C in calibrating PMS models, but
would also help to better understand the dynamics of the whole ABDoradus
system. Aims. We aim to determine the individual masses of the pair ABDor Ba/Bb
using VLBI observations and archive infrared data, as part of a larger program
directed to monitor binary systems in the ABDoradus moving group. Methods. We
observed the system ABDor B between 2007 and 2013 with the Australian Long
Baseline Array (LBA), at a frequency of 8.4 GHz in phase-reference mode.
Results. We detected, for the first time, compact radio emission from both
stars in the binary, ABDor Ba and ABDor Bb. This result allowed us to determine
the orbital parameters of both the relative and absolute orbits and,
consequently, their individual dynamical masses: 0.28+/-0.05 Msun and
0.25+/-0.05 Msun, respectively. Conclusions. Comparisons of the dynamical
masses with the prediction of PMS evolutionary models show that the models
underpredict the dynamical masses of the binary components Ba and Bb by 10-30%
and 10-40%, respectively, although they all still agree at the 2-sigma level.
Some of stellar models considered favour an age between 50 and 100 Myr for this
system, meanwhile others predict older ages. We also discuss the evolutionary
status of ABDor Ba/Bb in terms of an earlier double-double star scenario that
might explain the strong radio emission detected in both components.

evident as a sag below the expected diagonal line of the P-P plot showing the
fraction of signals found within a certain significance level versus that
significance level. It would be hoped that recently proposed techniques for
accounting for model uncertainties in parameter estimation would, to some
extent, alleviate this problem. Here we demonstrate that this is indeed the
case. We derive an analytic approximation to the P-P plot obtained when using
an incorrect signal model to perform parameter estimation. This approximation
is valid in the limit of high signal-to-noise ratio and nearly correct waveform
models. We show how the P-P plot changes if a Gaussian process likelihood that
allows for model errors is used to analyse the data. We demonstrate
analytically and using numerical simulations that the bias is always reduced in
this way. These results provide a way to quantify bias in inference on
populations and demonstrate the importance of utilising methods to mitigate
this bias.

repulsive triangle interactions have infinite range as well and depend on the
underlying geometry and thus are a first step towards studying phase
transitions for geometry-dependent multi-body systems. Our approach involves a
Delaunay random-cluster representation analogous to the Fortuin-Kasteleyn

observed at larger angles they appear as radio-galaxies, and we expect to
observe an analogue parent population for beamed NLS1s. However, the number of
known NLS1s with the jet viewed at large angles is not enough. Therefore, we
tried to understand the origin of this deficit. Current hypotheses about the
nature of parent sources are steep-spectrum radio-loud NLS1s, radio-quiet NLS1s
and disk-hosted radio-galaxies. To test these hypotheses we built three samples
of candidate sources plus a control sample, and calculated their black hole
mass and Eddington ratio using their optical spectra. We then performed a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test to investigate the compatibility of our
different samples with a beamed population. Our results indicate that, when the
inclination angle increases, a beamed source appears as a steep-spectrum
radio-loud NLS1, or possibly even as a disk-hosted radio-galaxy with low black
hole mass and high Eddington ratio. Further investigations, involving larger
complete samples and observations at radio frequency, are needed to understand
the incidence of disk-hosted radio-galaxies in the parent population, and to
assess whether radio-quiet NLS1s can play a role, as well.

E-type galaxies is a factor of 2, 4 and 5 larger than the mass in the
satellites of S0, Sa and Sb/c types, respectively. If these satellites would
eventually infall into the host galaxies, for all the morphological types, the
merger channel will be largely dominated by satellites with a mass ratio
satellite-host $\mu$ > 0.1. The fact that massive elliptical galaxies have a
significant larger number of satellites than massive spirals could point out
that elliptical galaxies inhabit heavier dark matter haloes than equally
massive galaxies with later morphological types. If this hypothesis is correct,
the dark matter haloes of late-type spiral galaxies are a factor ~2-3 more
efficient on producing galaxies with the same stellar mass than those dark
matter haloes of early-type galaxies.

allows us to model and calibrate the shear measurement process using image
simulations from the Ultra Fast Image Generator (UFig; Berge et al. 2013). We
apply this framework to a subset of the data taken during the Science
Verification period (SV) of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We calibrate the UFig
simulations to be statistically consistent with DES images. We then perform
tolerance analyses by perturbing the simulation parameters and study their
impact on the shear measurement at the one-point level. This allows us to
determine the relative importance of different input parameters to the
simulations. For spatially constant systematic errors and six simulation
parameters, the calibration of the simulation reaches the weak lensing
precision needed for the DES SV survey area. Furthermore, we find a sensitivity
of the shear measurement to the intrinsic ellipticity distribution, and an
interplay between the magnitude-size and the pixel value diagnostics in
constraining the noise model. This work is the first application of the
$\textit{MCCL}$ framework to data and shows how it can be used to methodically
study the impact of systematics on the cosmic shear measurement.

allowed to propagate in the bulk. In this context, a slightly broken flavor
symmetry imposed universally on all fermion fields, without distinction, can
generate the full flavor structure of the SM, including quarks, charged leptons
and neutrinos. For quarks and charged leptons, the exponential sensitivity of
their wave-functions to small flavor breaking effects yield naturally
hierarchical masses and mixing as it is usual in warped models with fermions in
the bulk. In the neutrino sector, the exponential wave-function factors can be
flavor-blind and thus insensitive to the small flavor symmetry breaking
effects, directly linking their masses and mixing angles to the flavor
symmetric structure of the 5D neutrino Yukawa couplings. The Higgs must be
localized in the bulk and the model is naturally more successful in generalized
warped scenarios where the metric background solution is different than
$AdS_5$. We study these features in two simple frameworks, flavor
complimentarily, and flavor democracy, which provide specific predictions and

the range z= 1.36-2.59 and high S/N measurements of, or upper limits on, the
H-alpha and H-beta emission lines obtained with Keck/MOSFIRE. We construct
composite SEDs of galaxies in bins of specific SFR and Balmer optical depth in
order to directly constrain the dust attenuation curve from the UV through
near-IR for typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Our results imply
an attenuation curve that is very similar to the SMC extinction curve at
wavelengths redward of 2500 Angstroms. At shorter wavelengths, the shape of the
curve is identical to that of the Calzetti relation, but with a lower
normalization (R_V). Hence, the new attenuation curve results in SFRs that are
~20% lower, and log stellar masses that are 0.16 dex lower, than those obtained
with the Calzetti attenuation curve. Moreover, we find that the difference in
the reddening---and the total attenuation---of the ionized gas and stellar
continuum correlates strongly with SFR, such that for dust-corrected SFRs
larger than 20 Msun/yr assuming a Chabrier IMF, the nebular emission lines
suffer an increasing degree of obscuration relative to the continuum. A simple
model that can account for these trends is one in which the UV through optical
stellar continuum is dominated by a population of less reddened stars, while
the nebular line and bolometric luminosities become increasingly dominated by
dustier stellar populations for galaxies with large SFRs, as a result of the
increased dust enrichment that accompanies such galaxies. Consequently, UV- and
SED-based SFRs may underestimate the total SFR at even modest levels of ~20
Msun/yr. [Abridged]

produces an inflaton excursion greater than the axion scales in the potential.
We show that, starting from a general potential of two axions with two aligned
potential terms, the effective theory for the resulting light direction is
characterized by four parameters: an effective potential scale, an effective
axion constant, and two extra parameters (related to ratios of the axion scales
and the potential scales in the $2-$field theory). For all choices of these
extra parameters, the model can support inflation along valleys (in the
$2-$field space) that end in minima of the potential. This leads to a
phenomenology similar to that of single field Natural Inflation. For a
significant range of the extra two parameters, the model possesses also higher
altitude inflationary trajectories passing through saddle points of the
$2-$field potential, and disconnected from any minimum. These plateaus end when
the heavier direction becomes unstable, and therefore all of inflation takes
place close to the saddle point, where - due to the higher altitude - the
potential is flatter (smaller $\epsilon$ parameter). As a consequence, a
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = {\rm O } \left( 10^{-4} - 10^{-2} \right)$ can be
easily achieved in the allowed $n_s$ region, well within the latest $1 \sigma$

numerical simulations to investigate the effects of confinement and non-uniform

incorporating a detailed treatment of boundary conditions within a simple
kinetic model where the configuration of the suspension is described using a
conservation equation for the probability distribution function of particle
positions and orientations, and where particle-particle and particle-wall
hydrodynamic interactions are neglected. Based on this model, we first
investigate the effects of confinement in the absence of flow, in which case
the dynamics is governed by a swimming Peclet number, or ratio of the
persistence length of particle trajectories over the channel width, and a
second swimmer-specific parameter whose inverse measures the strength of
propulsion. In the limit of weak and strong propulsion, asymptotic expressions
for the full distribution function are derived. For finite propulsion,
analytical expressions for the concentration and polarization profiles are also
obtained using a truncated moment expansion of the distribution function. In
agreement with experimental observations, the existence of a
concentration/polarization boundary layer in wide channels is reported and
characterized, suggesting that wall accumulation in active suspensions is
primarily a kinematic effect which does not require hydrodynamic interactions.
Next, we show that application of a pressure-driven Poiseuille flow leads to
net upstream swimming of the particles relative to the flow, and an analytical
expression for the mean upstream velocity is derived in the weak flow limit. In

  Most approaches to computing channel capacity are either efficient and return
only (possibly very loose) upper bounds, or alternatively are inefficient but
precise; few target realistic programs. In this thesis, we present a novel
approach to the problem by reducing it to a model counting problem on
first-order logic, which we name Model Counting Modulo Theories or #SMT for
brevity.
  For quantitative security, our contribution is twofold. First, on the
theoretical side we establish the connections between measuring confidentiality
leaks and fundamental verification algorithms like Symbolic Execution, SMT
solvers and DPLL. Second, exploiting these connections, we develop novel
#SMT-based techniques to compute channel capacity, which achieve both accuracy
and efficiency. These techniques are scalable to real-world programs, and
illustrative case studies include C programs from Linux kernel, a Java program
from a European project and anonymity protocols.
  For formal verification, our contribution is also twofold. First, we
introduce and study a new research problem, namely #SMT, which has other
potential applications beyond computing channel capacity, such as returning
multiple-counterexamples for Bounded Model Checking or automated test
generation. Second, we propose an alternative approach for Bounded Model
Checking using classical Symbolic Execution, which can be parallelised to

materials displaying a rich phase-diagram of metallic and insulating phases
associated with charge and magnetic order. Being in the charge transfer regime,
Ni$^{3+}$ in octahedral coordination displays a strong hybridization with
oxygen to form $3d$ - $2p$ mixed states, which results in a strong admixture of
$3d^8\underline{L}$ into $3d^7$, where $\underline{L}$ denotes a hole on the
oxygen. To understand the nature of this strongly hybridized ground state, we
present a detailed study of the Ni and O electronic structure using
high-resolution soft X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). Through a comparison
of the evolution of the XAS line-shape at Ni L- and O K-edges across the phase
diagram, we explore the changes in the electronic signatures in connection with
the insulating and metallic phases that support the idea of hybridization
playing a fundamental role.

to invert the photometric measurements of asteroids collected by the European
Space Agency Gaia mission. To do that, we performed several sets of simulations
for 10 000 asteroids having different spin axis orientations, rotational
periods and shapes. The observational epochs used for each simulation were
extracted from the Gaia mission simulator developed at the Observatoire de la
C\^{o}te d'Azur, while the brightness was generated using a Z-buffer standard
graphic method. We also explored the influence on the inversion results of
contaminating the data set with Gaussian noise with different $\sigma$ values.
The research enabled us to determine a correlation between the reliability of
the inversion method and the asteroid's pole latitude. In particular, the
results are biased for asteroids having quasi-spherical shapes and low pole
latitudes. This effect is caused by the low lightcurve amplitude observed under
such circumstances, as the periodic signal can be lost in the photometric
random noise when both values are comparable, causing the inversion to fail.
Such bias might be taken into account when analysing the inversion results, not
to mislead it with physical effects such as non-gravitational forces. Finally,
we studied what impact on the inversion results has combining a full lightcurve
and Gaia photometry collected simultaneously. Using this procedure we have
shown that it is possible to reduce the number of wrong solutions for asteroids
having less than 50 data points. The latter will be of special importance for
planning ground-based observations of asteroids aiming to enhance the
scientific impact of Gaia on Solar system science.

detect a loss of lactobacilli and acquisition of anaerobes. This diagnostic
does not reflect the microbiota composition accurately as lactobacilli can
assume different morphotypes, and assigning BV associated morphotypes to
specific organisms is challenging. Using an untargeted metabolomics approach we
identify novel biomarkers for BV in a cohort of 131 Rwandan women, and
demonstrate that metabolic products in the vagina are strongly associated with
bacterial diversity. Metabolites associated with high diversity and clinical BV
include 2-hydroxyisovalerate and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), but not the
anaerobic end-product succinate. Low diversity, and high relative abundance of
lactobacilli, is characterized by lactate and amino acids. Biomarkers
associated with diversity and BV are independent of pregnancy status, and were
validated in a blinded replication cohort from Tanzania (n=45), in which we
predicted clinical BV with 91% accuracy. Correlations between the metabolome

of quantum cosmology is that decoherence requires subsystems, and cosmology is
the study of the whole Universe. Consistent histories gave a possible answer to
this conundrum, by phrasing decoherence as loss of interference between
alternative histories of closed systems. When one can apply Boolean logic to a
set of histories, it is deemed 'consistent'. However, the vast majority of the
sets of histories that are merely consistent are blatantly nonclassical in
other respects, and further constraints than just consistency need to be
invoked. In this paper, I attempt to give an alternative answer to the issues
faced by consistent histories, by exploring a timeless interpretation of
quantum mechanics of closed systems. This is done solely in terms of path
integrals in non-relativistic, timeless, configuration space. What prompts a
fresh look at such foundational problems in this context is the advent of
multiple gravitational models in which Lorentz symmetry is not fundamental, but
only emergent. And what allows this approach to overcome previous barriers to a
timeless, conditional probabilities interpretation of quantum mechanics is the
new notion of records -- made possible by an inherent asymmetry of
configuration space. I outline and explore consequences of this approach for
foundational issues of quantum mechanics, such as the natural emergence of the
Born rule, conservation of probabilities, and the Sleeping Beauty paradox.

function of the Ising model on a planar trivalent graph and the generating
series of the spin network evaluations on the same graph. We provide
respectively a fermionic and a bosonic Gaussian integral formulation for each
of these functions and we show that they are the inverse of each other (up to
some explicit constants) by exhibiting a supersymmetry relating the two
formulations. We investigate three aspects and applications of this duality.
First, we propose higher order supersymmetric theories which couple the
geometry of the spin networks to the Ising model and for which supersymmetric
localization still holds. Secondly, after interpreting the generating function
of spin network evaluations as the projection of a coherent state of loop
quantum gravity onto the flat connection state, we find the probability
distribution induced by that coherent state on the edge spins and study its
stationary phase approximation. It is found that the stationary points
correspond to the critical values of the couplings of the 2D Ising model, at
least for isoradial graphs. Third, we analyze the mapping of the correlations
of the Ising model to spin network observables, and describe the phase
transition on those observables on the hexagonal lattice. This opens the door
to many new possibilities, especially for the study of the coarse-graining and
continuum limit of spin networks in the context of quantum gravity.

areas, such as the word co-occurrence in the sentences, friends co-occurrence
in social networks and products co-occurrence in commercial transaction data,
etc, which contains rich correlation and clustering information about the
items. In this paper, we study co-occurrence data using a general energy-based
probabilistic model, and we analyze three different categories of energy-based
model, namely, the $L_1$, $L_2$ and $L_k$ models, which are able to capture
different levels of dependency in the co-occurrence data. We also discuss how
several typical existing models are related to these three types of energy
models, including the Fully Visible Boltzmann Machine (FVBM) ($L_2$), Matrix
Factorization ($L_2$), Log-BiLinear (LBL) models ($L_2$), and the Restricted
Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model ($L_k$). Then, we propose a Deep Embedding Model
(DEM) (an $L_k$ model) from the energy model in a \emph{principled} manner.
Furthermore, motivated by the observation that the partition function in the
energy model is intractable and the fact that the major objective of modeling
the co-occurrence data is to predict using the conditional probability, we
apply the \emph{maximum pseudo-likelihood} method to learn DEM. In consequence,
the developed model and its learning method naturally avoid the above
difficulties and can be easily used to compute the conditional probability in
prediction. Interestingly, our method is equivalent to learning a special
structured deep neural network using back-propagation and a special sampling
strategy, which makes it scalable on large-scale datasets. Finally, in the
experiments, we show that the DEM can achieve comparable or better results than
state-of-the-art methods on datasets across several application domains.

found to convert the solitons either to undular bores or to shock-like waves

But the compactons tend to vanish due to viscous effects. The local oscillatory

self-assembled networks of memristive devices and demonstrations of their
computational capability through reservoir computing. Reservoir computing is an
approach that takes advantage of collective system dynamics for real-time
computing. A dynamical system, called a reservoir, is excited with a
time-varying signal and observations of its states are used to reconstruct a
desired output signal. However, such a monolithic assembly limits the
computational power due to signal interdependency and the resulting correlated
readouts. Here, we introduce an approach that hierarchically composes a set of
interconnected memristive networks into a larger reservoir. We use signal
amplification and restoration to reduce reservoir state correlation, which
improves the feature extraction from the input signals. Using the same number
of output signals, such a hierarchical composition of heterogeneous small
networks outperforms monolithic memristive networks by at least 20% on waveform
generation tasks. On the NARMA-10 task, we reduce the error by up to a factor
of 2 compared to homogeneous reservoirs with sigmoidal neurons, whereas single
memristive networks are unable to produce the correct result. Hierarchical
composition is key for solving more complex tasks with such novel nano-scale

behavior satisfies a finite-word linear-time temporal objective while incurring

constructed from finite partitions of the state and input spaces by solving
optimization problems. A sequence of suboptimal controllers is obtained by
considering a sequence of uniformly refined partitions. The abstract system
satisfies the condition that the cost of the optimal control on the abstract
system provides an upper bound on the cost of the optimal control for the
original system. Furthermore, each suboptimal controller gives trajectories
that have the cost upper bounded by the cost of the optimal control on the
corresponding abstract system. In fact, the costs achieved by the sequence of
suboptimal controllers converge to the optimal cost for the piecewise linear

attraction between atoms is sufficiently strong. Here we present a theory of
collapse for condensates with the interatomic attraction and spin-orbit
coupling. We consider two realizations of spin-orbit coupling: the axial Rashba
coupling and balanced, effectively one-dimensional, Rashba-Dresselhaus one. In
both cases spin-dependent ""anomalous"" velocity, proportional to the spin-orbit
coupling strength, plays a crucial role. For the Rashba coupling, this velocity
forms a centrifugal component in the density flux opposite to that arising due
to the attraction between particles and prevents the collapse at a sufficiently
strong coupling. For the balanced Rashba-Dresselhaus coupling, the
spin-dependent velocity can spatially split the initial state in one dimension
and form spin-projected wavepackets, reducing the total condensate density.
Depending on the spin-orbit coupling strength, interatomic attraction, and the
initial state, this splitting either prevents the collapse or modifies the
collapse process. These results show that the collapse can be controlled by a
spin-orbit coupling, thus, extending the domain of existence of condensates of
attracting atoms.

classification problems that can be used when a small number of instances are
incrementally added or removed. For quickly updating the classifier in such a
situation, incremental learning algorithms have been intensively studied in the
literature. Although they are much more efficient than solving the optimization
problem from scratch, their computational complexity yet depends on the entire
training set size. It means that, if the original training set is large,
completely solving an incremental learning problem might be still rather
expensive. To circumvent this computational issue, we propose a novel framework
that allows us to make an inference about the updated classifier without
actually re-optimizing it. Specifically, the proposed framework can quickly
provide a lower and an upper bounds of a quantity on the unknown updated
classifier. The main advantage of the proposed framework is that the
computational cost of computing these bounds depends only on the number of
updated instances. This property is quite advantageous in a typical sensitivity
analysis task where only a small number of instances are updated. In this paper
we demonstrate that the proposed framework is applicable to various practical
sensitivity analysis tasks, and the bounds provided by the framework are often
sufficiently tight for making desired inferences.

$G$ and $H$ one is to check whether $G$ is a subgraph of $H$. Despite its
simple definition, the Subgraph Isomorphism problem turns out to be very broad,
as it generalizes problems such as Clique, $r$-Coloring, Hamiltonicity, Set
Packing and Bandwidth. However, for all of the mentioned problems
$2^{\mathcal{O}(n)}$ time algorithms exist, so a natural and frequently asked
question in the past was whether there exists a $2^{\mathcal{O}(n)}$ time
algorithm for Subgraph Isomorphism. In the monograph of Fomin and Kratsch
[Springer'10] this question is highlighted as an open problem, among few
others.
  Our main result is a reduction from 3-SAT, producing a subexponential number
of sublinear instances of the Subgraph Isomorphism problem. In particular, our
reduction implies a $2^{\Omega(n \sqrt{\log n})}$ lower bound for Subgraph
Isomorphism under the Exponential Time Hypothesis. This shows that there exist
classes of graphs that are strictly harder to embed than cliques or Hamiltonian
cycles.
  The core of our reduction consists of two steps. First, we preprocess and
pack variables and clauses of a 3-SAT formula into groups of logarithmic size.
However, the grouping is not arbitrary, since as a result we obtain only a
limited interaction between the groups. In the second step, we overcome the
technical hardness of encoding evaluations as permutations by a simple, yet
fruitful scheme of guessing the sizes of preimages of an arbitrary mapping,
reducing the case of arbitrary mapping to bijections. In fact, when applying
this step to a recent independent result of Fomin et al.[arXiv:1502.05447
(2015)], who showed hardness of Graph Homomorphism, we can transfer their
hardness result to Subgraph Isomorphism, implying a nearly tight lower bound of
$2^{\Omega(n \log n / \log \log n)}$.

describe the evolution of the Lorenz system in geometric terms, by considering
it as a geodesic in a Finsler space. By associating a non-linear connection and
a Berwald type connection, five geometrical invariants are obtained, with the

RRS is shown to be superior to PRS with respect to the end-to-end symbol error

3.3 +/- 0.7 km/s. The mass-to-light ratio of Ret II within its half-light
radius is 470 +/- 210 Msun/Lsun, demonstrating that it is a strongly dark
matter-dominated system. Despite its spatial proximity to the Magellanic
Clouds, the radial velocity of Ret II differs from that of the LMC and SMC by
199 and 83 km/s, respectively, suggesting that it is not gravitationally bound
to the Magellanic system. The likely member stars of Ret II span 1.3 dex in
metallicity, with a dispersion of 0.28 +/- 0.09 dex, and we identify several
extremely metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] < -3. In combination with its
luminosity, size, and ellipticity, these results confirm that Ret II is an
ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. With a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.65 +/- 0.07,
Ret II matches Segue~1 as the most metal-poor galaxy known. Although Ret II is
the third-closest dwarf galaxy to the Milky Way, the line-of-sight integral of
the dark matter density squared is log J = 18.8 +/- 0.6 Gev^2/cm^5 within 0.2

states of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), which can be formulated as an
energy minimization problem with a spherical constraint. The energy functional
and constraint are discretized by either the finite difference, or sine or
Fourier pseudospectral discretization schemes and thus the original infinite
dimensional nonconvex minimization problem is approximated by a finite
dimensional constrained nonconvex minimization problem. Then an initial
solution is first constructed by using a feasible gradient type method, which
is an explicit scheme and maintains the spherical constraint automatically. To
accelerate the convergence of the gradient type method, we approximate the
energy functional by its second-order Taylor expansion with a regularized term
at each Newton iteration and adopt a cascadic multigrid technique for selecting
initial data. It leads to a standard trust-region subproblem and we solve it
again by the feasible gradient type method. The convergence of the regularized
Newton method is established by adjusting the regularization parameter as the
standard trust-region strategy. Extensive numerical experiments on challenging
examples, including a BEC in three dimensions with an optical lattice potential
and rotating BECs in two dimensions with rapid rotation and strongly repulsive
interaction, show that our method is efficient, accurate and robust.

matter and radiation enclosed by the dynamical apparent horizon with the
Hawking temperature. For two viable f(G) models, we first numerically solve the
set of differential equations governing the dynamics of f(G)-gravity. Then, we
obtain the evolutions of the Hubble parameter, the Gauss-Bonnet curvature
invariant term, the density and equation of state parameters as well as the
deceleration parameter. In addition, we check the energy conditions for both
models and finally examine the validity of the GSL. For the selected f(G)
models, we conclude that both models have a stable de Sitter attractor. The
equation of state parameters behave quite similar to those of the LCDM model in
the radiation/matter dominated epochs, then they enter the phantom region
before reaching the de Sitter attractor with w=-1. The deceleration parameter
starts from the radiation/matter dominated eras, then transits from a cosmic
deceleration to acceleration and finally approaches a de Sitter regime at late
times, as expected. Furthermore, the GSL is respected for both models during
the standard radiation/matter dominated epochs. Thereafter when the universe
becomes accelerating, the GSL is violated in some ranges of scale factor. At
late times, the evolution of the GSL predicts an adiabatic behavior for the
