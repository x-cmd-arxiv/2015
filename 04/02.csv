hosts presumes that changes in host and virus fate require the initiation of
infection of a host by a virus. That is, first virus particles diffuse randomly
outside of host cells, then the virus genome enters the target host cell, and
only then do intracellular dynamics and regulation of virus and host cell fate
unfold. Intracellular dynamics may lead to the death of the host cell and
release of viruses, to the elimination of the virus genome through cellular
defense mechanisms, or the integration of the virus genome with the host as a
chromosomal or extra-chromosomal element. Here we revisit this canonical view,
inspired by recent experimental findings of Bautista and colleagues (mBio,
2015) in which the majority of target host cells can be induced into a dormant
state when exposed to either active or de-activated viruses, even when viruses
are present at low relative titer. We propose that both the qualitative
phenomena and the quantitative time-scales of dormancy induction can be
reconciled given the hypothesis that cellular physiology can be altered by
contact on the surface of host cells rather than strictly by infection. We
develop a biophysical model of contact-mediated dynamics involving virus
particles and target cells. We show how in this model virus particles can
catalyze - extracellularly - cellular transformations amongst many cells, even
if they ultimately infect only one (or none). We discuss implications of the
present biophysical model relevant to the study of virus-microbe interactions

evolve for six orbits. We find that small constraint violations can have large
dynamical effects, but these can be removed by using a constraint-damping
system like the conformal covariant formulation of the Z4 system. We find
agreement between the subsequent numerical spacetime and the predictions of
post-Newtonian theory for the waveform and inspiral rate that is within the

highlight the crucial role quantum confinement can have in producing a wide

the highest priorities in the field is to search for new 2D crystalline systems
with structural and electronic properties that can be exploited for device
development. In this letter, we report on the unusual quantum transport
properties of the 2D ternary transition metal chalcogenide - Nb3SiTe6. We show
that the micaceous nature of Nb3SiTe6 allows it to be thinned down to
one-unit-cell thick 2D crystals using microexfoliation technique. When the
thickness of Nb3SiTe6 crystal is reduced below a few unit-cells thickness, we
observed an unexpected, enhanced weak-antilocalization signature in
magnetotransport. This finding provides solid evidence for the long-predicted
suppression of electron-phonon interaction caused by the crossover of phonon

However, estimating the evidence and Bayes' factors (BFs) for these models

importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo methods for estimating BFs that
use simulation to circumvent the evaluation of the intractable likelihood, and
compares them to existing methods. In some cases we observe an advantage in the

to perform either hill-climbing local search or Markov chain Monte Carlo across

subtree-prune-regraft (SPR) moves that remove a subtree and reattach it
somewhere else via the cut edge of the subtree. Phylogenetic trees and such
moves naturally form the vertices and edges of a graph, such that tree search
algorithms perform a (potentially stochastic) traversal of this SPR graph.
Despite the centrality of such graphs in phylogenetic inference, rather little
is known about their large-scale properties. In this paper we learn about the
rooted-tree version of the graph, known as the rSPR graph, by calculating the
Ricci-Ollivier curvature for pairs of vertices in the rSPR graph with respect
to two simple random walks on the rSPR graph. By proving theorems and direct
calculation with novel algorithms, we find a remarkable diversity of different
curvatures on the rSPR graph for pairs of vertices separated by the same
distance. We confirm using simulation that degree and curvature have the
expected impact on mean access time distributions, demonstrating relevance of
these curvature results to stochastic tree search. This indicates significant
structure of the rSPR graph beyond that which was previously understood in
terms of pairwise distances and vertex degrees; a greater understanding of
curvature could ultimately lead to improved strategies for tree search.

  Sum-of-squares-based Small-feedback Approach","14 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The two main contributions of this paper are a proof of concept of the recent
novel idea in the area of long-time average cost control, and a new method of
overcoming the well-known difficulty of non-convexity of simultaneous
optimization of a control law and an additional tunable function. A
recently-proposed method of obtaining rigorous bounds of long-time average cost
is first outlined for the uncontrolled system with polynomials of system state
on the right-hand side. In this method the polynomial constraints are relaxed
to be sum-of-squares and formulated as semi-definite programs. It was proposed
to use the upper bound of long-time average cost as the objective function
instead of the time-average cost itself in controller design. In the present
paper this suggestion is implemented for a particular system and is shown to
give good results. Designing the optimal controller by this method requires
optimising simultaneously both the control law and a tunable function similar
to the Lyapunov function. The new approach proposed and implemented in this
paper for overcoming the inherent non-convexity of this optimisation is based
on a formal assumption that the amplitude of control is small. By expanding the
tunable function and the bound in the small parameter, the long-time average
cost is reduced by minimizing the respective bound in each term of the series.
The derivation of all the polynomial coefficients in controller is given in
terms of the solvability conditions of state-dependent linear and bilinear
inequalities. The resultant sum-of-squares problems are solved in sequence,
thus avoiding the non-convexity in optimization. The proposed approach is
implemented for a simple model of oscillatory vortex shedding behind a
cylinder.

hydrodynamic equations are used to investigate the relative velocity between
axion DM and baryons, and the moving-background perturbation theory (MBPT)
derived. Axions massive enough to be all of the DM do not affect the coherence
length of the relative velocity, but the MBPT equations are modified by the
inclusion of the axion effective sound speed. These MBPT equations are
necessary for accurately modelling the effects of axion DM on the formation of
the first cosmic structures, and suggest that the 21cm power spectrum could
improve constraints on axion mass by up to four orders of magnitude with
respect to the current best constraints. A further application of these results

future magnetic data storage. It is a fundamental question, relevant for both
basic research and application, if a ferroelectric (FE) polarization can be
associated with their magnetic texture and if these objects can be manipulated
by electric fields. Here, we study the interplay between magnetism and electric
polarization in the lacunar spinel GaV4S8, which undergoes a structural
transition associated with orbital ordering at 44 K and reveals a complex
magnetic phase diagram below 13 K, including a ferromagnetic (FM), cycloidal,
and N\'eel-type skyrmion lattice (SkL) phase. We found that the orbitally
ordered phase of GaV4S8 is FE with a sizable polarization of ~1 {\mu}C/cm2.
Moreover, we observed spin-driven excess polarizations in all magnetic phases
and, hence, GaV4S8 hosts three different multiferroic phases with coexisting
polar and magnetic order. These include the SkL phase where we predict a strong
spatial modulation of the FE polarization close to the skyrmion cores. By
taking into account the crystal symmetry and spin patterns of the magnetically
ordered phases, we identify the exchange striction as the main microscopic
mechanism behind the spin-driven FE polarization in each multiferroic phase.
Since GaV4S8 is unique among the known SkL host materials due to its polar
crystal structure and the observed strong magnetoelectric effect, this study is
an important step towards the non-dissipative electric-field control of
skyrmions.

surrounded by a retrograde accretion disk. Assuming the disk is exactly in the
binary plane and transfers energy and angular momentum to the binary via direct
gas accretion, we calculate the time evolution of the binary's semi-major axis
$a$ and eccentricity $e$. Because the gas is predominantly transferred when the
binary is at apocenter, we find the eccentricity grows rapidly while
maintaining constant $a(1+e)$. After accreting only a fraction of the
secondary's mass, the eccentricity grows to nearly unity; from then on,
gravitational wave emission dominates the evolution, preserving constant
$a(1-e)$. The high-eccentricity waveforms redistribute the peak gravitational
wave power from the nHz to $\mu$Hz bands, substantially affecting the signal
that might be detected with pulsar timing arrays. We also estimate the torque
coupling binaries of arbitrary eccentricity with obliquely aligned circumbinary
disks. If the outer edge of the disk is not an extremely large multiple of the
binary separation, retrograde accretion can drive the binary into the
gravitational wave-dominated state before these torques align the binary with
the angular momentum of the mass supply.

directly produced quarkonia in pp collisions at next-to-leading order (NLO),
namely up to alpha_s^3, within nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD). Our analysis is
based on the idea that the P_T-integrated and the P_T-differential cross
sections can be treated as two different observables. The colour-octet NRQCD
parameters needed to predict the P_T-integrated yield can thus be extracted
from the fits of the P_T-differential cross sections at mid and large P_T. For
the first time, the total cross section is evaluated in NRQCD at full NLO
accuracy using the recent NLO fits of the P_T-differential yields at RHIC, the
Tevatron and the LHC. Both the normalisation and the energy dependence of the
J/psi, psi' and Upsilon(1S), we obtained, are in disagreement with the data
irrespective of the fit method. The same is true if one uses CEM-like
colour-octet NRQCD parameters. If, on the contrary, one disregards the
colour-octet contribution, the existing data in the TeV range are well
described by the alpha_s^3 contribution in the colour-singlet model --which, at
alpha_s^4, however shows an unphysical energy dependence. A similar observation
is made for eta(c,b). This calls for a full NNLO or for a resummation of the
initial-state radiation in this channel. In any case, past claims that
colour-octet transitions are dominantly responsible for low-P_T quarkonium
production are not supported by our results. This may impact the interpretation
of quarkonium suppression in high-energy proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus
collisions.

widespread exchange of ideas and collaboration. At that moment, co-authorship
networks show the analog of a percolation phenomenon, developing a giant

framework for analyzing finite, evolving networks in which each scientific

find evidence for universality near criticality implying that, as various
fields approach the topological transition, they do so with the same set of
critical exponents consistent with an effective dimensionality $d \simeq 1$.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been related with the events detected by IceCube.
These neutrinos, produced by hadronic interactions of Fermi-accelerated protons
with thermal photons and hadrons in internal shocks, are the only signature
when jet has not broken out or failed. Taking into account that the photon
field is thermalized at keV energies and the standard assumption that the
magnetic field maintains a steady value throughout the shock region (with a
width of $10^{10} - 10^{11}$ cm in the observed frame), we study the effect of
thermal and magnetized plasma generated in internal shocks on the neutrino
oscillations. We calculate the neutrino effective potential generated by this
plasma, the effects of the envelope of the star, and the vacuum on the path to
Earth. By considering these three effects, the two (solar, atmospheric and
accelerator parameters) and three neutrino mixing, we show that although GeV -
TeV neutrinos can oscillate resonantly from one flavor to another, a
nonsignificant deviation of the standard flavor ratio (1:1:1) could be expected
on Earth.

only two free parameters, namely the typical coupling $g_D$ and the scale $f_D$

used to determine the spectral function; challenges facing any kind of
deconvolution are discussed in detail with the aim of developing intuition for
when deconvolution is possible. Significant changes to the quarkonium spectral
function in the $1S$ channel are found, suggesting that any description of

type transforms, where integration is done over a family of conical surfaces.
We call them \emph{cone transforms} (in 2D they are also called \emph{V-line}
or \emph{broken ray} transforms). Most prominently, they are present in the so
called Compton camera imaging that arises in medical diagnostics, astronomy,
and lately in homeland security applications. Several specific incarnations of
the cone transform have been considered separately. In this paper, we address
the most general (and overdetermined) cone transform, obtain integral relations
between cone and Radon transforms in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and a variety of inversion
formulas. In many applications (e.g., in homeland security), the signal to
noise ratio is very low. So, if overdetermined data is collected (as in the
case of Compton imaging), attempts to reduce the dimensionality might lead to
essential elimination of the signal. Thus, our main concentration is on
obtaining formulas involving overdetermined data.

The latter correspond to soft-core potentials with an additional hard-core
onsite interaction. Using exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that
the low temperature phases for weak and strong interactions following a
temperature quench are a homogeneous superfluid and a glass, respectively. The
latter is an insulating phase characterized by inhomogeneity in the density
distribution and structural disorder. Remarkably, we find that for intermediate
interaction strengths a {\it superglass} occurs in an extended region of the
phase diagram, where glassy behavior coexists with a sizable finite superfluid
fraction. This glass phase is obtained in the absence of geometrical
frustration or external disorder and is a result of the competition of quantum
fluctuations and cluster formation in the corresponding classical ground state.
For high enough temperature, the glass and superglass turn into a floating
stripe solid and a supersolid, respectively. Given the simplicity and
generality of the model, these phases should be directly relevant for
state-of-the-art experiments with Rydberg-dressed atoms in optical lattices.

Relativity a density perturbation behaves locally (i.e. on scales much smaller
than the wavelength of the mode) as a separate universe with different
background density and curvature. We prove this conjecture for a spherical
compensated tophat density perturbation of arbitrary amplitude and radius in
$\Lambda$CDM. We then use Conformal Fermi Coordinates to generalize this result
to scalar perturbations of arbitrary configuration and scale. In this case, the
separate universe conjecture holds for the isotropic part of the perturbations.
The anisotropic part on the other hand is exactly captured by a tidal field in
the Newtonian form. We show that the separate universe picture is restricted to
scales larger than the sound horizons of all fluid components. We then derive
an expression for the locally measured matter bispectrum induced by a
long-wavelength mode of arbitrary wavelength. We show that nonlinear
gravitational dynamics does not generate observable contributions that scale
like local-type non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, and hence does not
contribute to a scale-dependent galaxy bias $\Delta b \propto k^{-2}$ on large
scales; rather, the locally measurable long-short mode coupling assumes a form
essentially identical to subhorizon perturbation theory results, once the
long-mode density perturbation is replaced by the synchronous-comoving gauge
density perturbation. Apparent $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$-type contributions arise
through projection effects on photon propagation, which depend on the specific
large-scale structure tracer and observable considered, and are in principle
distinguishable from the local mode coupling induced by gravity. We conclude
that any observation of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ beyond these projection effects
signals a departure from standard single-clock inflation.

sample and show that the sample stretches out as a plane in the 3D logarithmic
space created by bolometric luminosity, radio luminosity and black hole mass.
We reproduce the established Fundamental Plane of Black Hole activity in

hole sample alone and the X-ray binaries agrees to the found relation. We also
discuss radio loudness of various classes of low-luminosity AGN in view of our

nature and timing of cosmic reionization events, but its inference from the
Ly-alpha forest is degenerate with the 3-D structure of the IGM on ~100 kpc
scales, where, analogous to the classical Jeans argument, the pressure of the
T~$10^4$ K gas supports it against gravity. We simulate the IGM using smoothed
particle hydrodynamics, and find that, at z < 6, the gas density power spectrum
does not exhibit the expected Jeans filtering cutoff, because dense gas in
collapsed halos dominates the small-scale power masking pressure smoothing
effects. We introduce a new statistic, the real-space Ly-alpha flux,
$F_\mathrm{real}$, which naturally suppresses dense gas, and is thus robust
against the poorly understood physics of galaxy formation, revealing pressure
smoothing in the diffuse IGM. The $F_\mathrm{real}$ power spectrum is
accurately described by a simple fitting function with cutoff at $\lambda_F$,
allowing us to rigorously quantify the filtering scale for the first time: we
find $\lambda_F$ = 79 kpc (comoving) at z=3 for our fiducial thermal model.
This statistic has the added advantage that it directly relates to observations
of correlated Ly-alpha forest absorption in close quasar pairs, recently
proposed as a method to measure the filtering scale. Our results enable one to
quantify the filtering scale in simulations, and ask meaningful questions about
its dependence on reionization and thermal history. Accordingly, the standard
description of the IGM in terms of the amplitude $T_0$ and slope $\gamma$ of
the temperature-density relation $T = T_0\Delta^{\gamma-1}$ should be augmented
with a third filtering scale parameter $\lambda_F$.

the black hole horizon. It is also well-known that a freely falling observer
takes finite time to reach the horizon from an outside point. However, the
usual assumption is that such an observer resides in a frame of reference
(spaceship) of infinitesimal size. This assumption is justified as long as the
coordinates are continuous enough to assume that the observer's frame is small
compared to the variations of the metric from a local flat metric. Such an
assumption may be invalid when the coordinate system has not only a
discontinuity but a singularity like the one at the horizon. Hence, here, the
characteristics of a finite frame (a spaceship) near a black hole horizon is
discussed. It is shown that clocks placed at the front and rear ends have
different time scales even in the limit when they reach the horizon at the same
time. This renders such a frame physically meaningless. It is also argued that
the forces that are expected to keep a realistic frame (like a spaceship) in
one piece tend to zero near the horizon. So, a physical spaceship is expected
to fall apart near the horizon.

only angstrom-size and physically vulnerable to high energy interactions, which
has prevented crystals from being applied to high power accelerators.
Carbon-based nano-crystals such as carbon-nanotubes (CNTs) and graphenes have a
large degree of dimensional flexibility and thermo-mechanical strength, which
could be suitable for channeling acceleration of MW beams. Nano-channels of the

  Complexity",,,,"SAFARI Technical Report No. 2015-004","cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a multicore system, applications running on different cores interfere at
main memory. This inter-application interference degrades overall system
performance and unfairly slows down applications. Prior works have developed
application-aware memory schedulers to tackle this problem. State-of-the-art
application-aware memory schedulers prioritize requests of applications that
are vulnerable to interference, by ranking individual applications based on
their memory access characteristics and enforcing a total rank order.
  In this paper, we observe that state-of-the-art application-aware memory
schedulers have two major shortcomings. First, such schedulers trade off
hardware complexity in order to achieve high performance or fairness, since
ranking applications with a total order leads to high hardware complexity.
Second, ranking can unfairly slow down applications that are at the bottom of
the ranking stack. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose the Blacklisting
Memory Scheduler (BLISS), which achieves high system performance and fairness
while incurring low hardware complexity, based on two observations. First, we
find that, to mitigate interference, it is sufficient to separate applications
into only two groups. Second, we show that this grouping can be efficiently
performed by simply counting the number of consecutive requests served from
each application.
  We evaluate BLISS across a wide variety of workloads/system configurations
and compare its performance and hardware complexity, with five state-of-the-art
memory schedulers. Our evaluations show that BLISS achieves 5% better system
performance and 25% better fairness than the best-performing previous scheduler
while greatly reducing critical path latency and hardware area cost of the
memory scheduler (by 79% and 43%, respectively), thereby achieving a good
trade-off between performance, fairness and hardware complexity.

Initial Submission: Mar. 2015",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Empirical Centroid Fictitious Play (ECFP) is a generalization of the
well-known Fictitious Play (FP) algorithm designed for implementation in
large-scale games. In ECFP, the set of players is subdivided into equivalence
classes with players in the same class possessing similar properties. Players
choose a next-stage action by tracking and responding to aggregate statistics
related to each equivalence class. This setup alleviates the difficult task of
tracking and responding to the statistical behavior of every individual player,
as is the case in traditional FP. Aside from ECFP, many useful modifications
have been proposed to classical FP, e.g., rules allowing for network-based
implementation, increased computational efficiency, and stronger forms of
learning. Such modifications tend to be of great practical value; however,
their effectiveness relies heavily on two fundamental properties of FP:
robustness to alterations in the empirical distribution step size process, and
robustness to best-response perturbations. The main contribution of the paper
is to show that similar robustness properties also hold for the ECFP algorithm.
This result serves as a first step in enabling practical modifications to ECFP,
similar to those already developed for FP.

The oxygen isotope record in sedimentary chert and the compelling case for a
near constant isotopic oxygen composition of seawater over geologic time
support thermophilic surface temperatures prevailing in the Archean, with some
support for hot conditions lasting until about 1.5 billion years ago, aside
from lower temperatures including glacial episodes at 2.1-2.4 Ga and possibly
an earlier one at 2.9 Ga. Other evidence includes the following: 1) Melting
temperatures of proteins resurrected from sequences inferred from robust
molecular phylogenies give paleotemperatures at emergence consistent with a
very warm early climate. 2) High atmospheric pCO2 levels in the Archean are
consistent with high climatic temperatures near the triple point of primary
iron minerals in banded iron formations, the formation of Mn-bicarbonate
clusters leading to oxygenic photosynthesis and generally higher weathering
intensities on land. These higher weathering intensities would not have
occurred if seafloor weathering dominated the carbon sink, pulling down the
temperature, hence this empirical evidence supports a hot climate and high
carbon dioxide levels. 3) The inferred viscosity of seawater at 2.7 Ga is
consistent with a hot Archean climate. 5) A cold Archean is hard to explain
taking into account the higher outgassing rates of carbon dioxide,
significantly smaller land areas and weaker biotic enhancement of weathering
than present in the context of the long-term carbon cycle, taking into account
the fainter Archean sun in climate modeling. This evidence points to an
important conclusion regarding biological evolution, namely to the critical
role of a temperature constraint holding back the emergence of major organismal
groups, starting with phototrophs, culminating with metazoans in the latest
Precambrian.

in the two-dimensional three-color Ashkin-Teller model by means of large-scale
Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that the first-order phase transition
is rounded by the disorder and turns into a continuous one. Using a careful
finite-size-scaling analysis, we provide strong evidence for the emerging
critical behavior of the disordered Ashkin-Teller model to be in the clean
two-dimensional Ising universality class, accompanied by universal logarithmic
corrections. This agrees with perturbative renormalization-group predictions by
Cardy. As a byproduct, we also provide support for the strong-universality
scenario for the critical behavior of the two-dimensional disordered Ising
model. We discuss consequences of our results for the classification of
disordered phase transitions as well as generalizations to other systems.

structure called a conformal crystal which preserves the six-fold ordering of
the original lattice but contains a gradient in the pinning density. Here we
use numerical simulations to show that vortices in type-II superconductors
driven with an ac drive over gradient pinning arrays produce the most
pronounced ratchet effect over a wide range of parameters for a conformal
array, while square gradient or random gradient arrays with equivalent pinning
densities give reduced ratchet effects. In the conformal array, the larger
spacing of the pinning sites in the direction transverse to the ac drive
permits easy funneling of interstitial vortices for one driving direction,
producing the enhanced ratchet effect. In the square array, the transverse
spacing between pinning sites is uniform, giving no asymmetry in the funneling
of the vortices as the driving direction switches, while in the random array,
there are numerous easy-flow channels present for either direction of drive. We
find multiple ratchet reversals in the conformal arrays as a function of vortex
density and ac amplitude, and correlate the features with a reversal in the
vortex ordering, which is greater for motion in the ratchet direction. The
enhanced conformal pinning ratchet effect can also be realized for colloidal
particles moving over a conformal array, indicating the general usefulness of
conformal structures for controlling the motion of particles.

element model of contracting muscle. The model was based on continuum theory
for fibre-reinforced composite materials. Here we simulated contractions for an
idealized medial gastrocnemius muscle in man, using the model. Simulations were
performed to test the force-length relation of the whole muscle, to evaluate
the changes in internal fascicle geometry during contractions, and to assess
the importance of material formulations for the aponeurosis and tendon. The
simulation results were compared to previously published experimental values.
The force-length profile for the whole muscle showed a realistic profile. As
the muscle contracted the fascicles curved into S-shaped trajectories and
curled around 3D paths, both of which matched previous experimental findings.
As the fascicles shortened they increased in their cross-sectional area, but
this increase was asymmetric with the smaller increase occurring within the
fascicle-plane: the Poisson's ratio in this plane matched that previously shown
from ultrasound imaging. The distribution of strains in the aponeurosis and
tendon was shown to be a function of their material properties. This study
demonstrated that the model could replicate realistic patterns of whole
muscle-force, and changes to the internal muscle geometry, and so will be
useful for testing mechanisms that affect the structural changes within
contracting muscle.

free energy on the sign of the solute charge--quantifies the asymmetric

CHA are critical for understanding hydration effects ubiquitous in chemistry
and biology. However, measuring hydration energies of charged species is
fraught with significant difficulties, which lead to unacceptably large (up to
300%) variation in the available estimates of the CHA effect. We circumvent
these difficulties by developing a framework which allows us to extract and
accurately estimate the intrinsic propensity of water to exhibit CHA from
accurate experimental hydration free energies of neutral polar molecules.
Specifically, from a set of 504 small molecules we identify two pairs that are
analogous, with respect to CHA, to the K+/F- pair--a classical probe for the
effect. We use these ""CHA-conjugate"" molecule pairs to quantify the intrinsic
charge-asymmetric response of water to the microscopic charge perturbations:
the asymmetry of the response is strong, ~50% of the average hydration free
energy of these molecules. The ability of widely used classical water models to
predict hydration energies of small molecules correlates with their ability to
predict CHA.

optimized nonnegative matrices and has been widely used for unsupervised
learning tasks such as product recommendation based on a rating matrix.
However, although networks between nodes with the same nature exist, standard
NMF overlooks them, e.g., the social network between users. This problem leads
to comparatively low recommendation accuracy because these networks are also
reflections of the nature of the nodes, such as the preferences of users in a
social network. Also, social networks, as complex networks, have many different
structures. Each structure is a composition of links between nodes and reflects
the nature of nodes, so retaining the different network structures will lead to
differences in recommendation performance. To investigate the impact of these
network structures on the factorization, this paper proposes four multi-level
network factorization algorithms based on the standard NMF, which integrates
the vertical network (e.g., rating matrix) with the structures of horizontal
network (e.g., user social network). These algorithms are carefully designed
with corresponding convergence proofs to retain four desired network
structures. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed algorithms are
able to preserve the desired network structures as designed. Experiments on
real-world data show that considering the horizontal networks improves the
accuracy of document clustering and recommendation with standard NMF, and
various structures show their differences in performance on these two tasks.
These results can be directly used in document clustering and recommendation
systems.

observations and theoretical models of meridional circulation do not indicate a
single-celled flow pattern. We examine the role of complex multi-cellular
circulation patterns in a Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo in advection- and
diffusion-dominated regimes. We show from simulations that presence of a weak,
second, high-latitude reverse cell speeds up the cycle and slightly enhances
the poleward branch in butterfly diagram, whereas the presence of a second cell
in depth reverses the tilt of butterfly wing to an anti-solar type. A butterfly
diagram constructed from middle of convection zone yields a solar-like pattern,
but this may be difficult to realize in the Sun because of magnetic buoyancy
effects. Each of the above cases behaves similarly in higher and lower magnetic
diffusivity regimes. However, our dynamo with a meridional circulation
containing four cells in latitude behaves distinctly differently in the two
regimes, producing solar-like butterfly diagrams with fast cycles in the higher
diffusivity regime, and complex branches in butterfly diagrams in the lower
diffusivity regime. We also find that dynamo solutions for a four-celled
pattern, two in radius and two in latitude, prefer to quickly relax to
quadrupolar parity if the bottom flow-speed is strong enough, of similar order
of magnitude as the surface flow-speed.

privacy when the privacy level is subject to change over time. Existing work
assumes that privacy level is determined by the system designer as a fixed
value before sensitive data is released. For certain applications, however,
users may wish to relax the privacy level for subsequent releases of the same
data after either a re-evaluation of the privacy concerns or the need for
better accuracy. Specifically, given a database containing sensitive data, we
assume that a response $y_1$ that preserves $\epsilon_{1}$-differential privacy
has already been published. Then, the privacy level is relaxed to $\epsilon_2$,
with $\epsilon_2 > \epsilon_1$, and we wish to publish a more accurate response
$y_2$ while the joint response $(y_1, y_2)$ preserves $\epsilon_2$-differential
privacy. How much accuracy is lost in the scenario of gradually releasing two
responses $y_1$ and $y_2$ compared to the scenario of releasing a single
response that is $\epsilon_{2}$-differentially private? Our results show that
there exists a composite mechanism that achieves \textit{no loss} in accuracy.
We consider the case in which the private data lies within $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
with an adjacency relation induced by the $\ell_{1}$-norm, and we focus on
mechanisms that approximate identity queries. We show that the same accuracy
can be achieved in the case of gradual release through a mechanism whose
outputs can be described by a \textit{lazy Markov stochastic process}. This
stochastic process has a closed form expression and can be efficiently sampled.
Our results are applicable beyond identity queries. To this end, we demonstrate
that our results can be applied in several cases, including Google's RAPPOR

The design objective is to minimize the aggregate transmit power across all the
BSs subject to satisfying the user signal to interference noise ratio (SINR)
constraints. The algorithm requires the BSs to exchange parameters which can be
computed solely based on the channel statistics rather than the instantaneous
CSI. We make use of tools from random matrix theory to formulate the
decentralized algorithm. We also characterize a lower bound on the set of

is feasible. We further show that the performance of our algorithm
asymptotically matches the performance of the centralized algorithm with full

the individual BS transmit power constraints. Finally, we investigate the
impact of imperfect CSI and pilot contamination effect on the performance of
the decentralized algorithm, and propose a heuristic extension of the algorithm

UCHII regions are still accreting matter. The peak column densities and masses
of the infall candidates, in general, display a increasing trend with
progressing evolutionary stages. However, the rough estimates of the mass

solving the equation of motion in the analytically expressed electromagnetic
turbulences. These consist of primary SLSW and isotropically distributed
secondary electromagnetic waves. Under the dominance of the secondary waves,
all electrons gain nearly equal energy. On the other hand, when the primary
wave is dominant, selective acceleration occurs. The phase of the primary wave
felt by the electrons moving nearly along the wavevector changes very slowly
compared to the oscillation of the wave, which is called ""phase locked"", and
such electrons are continuously accelerated. This acceleration by SLSWs may
play a crucial role in the pre-acceleration for the shock acceleration. In
general, the radiation from the phase-locked population is different from the
synchro-Compton radiation. However, when the amplitude of the secondary waves
is not extremely weaker than that of the primary wave, the typical frequency
can be estimated from the synchro-Compton theory by using the secondary waves.
The primary wave does not contribute to the radiation, because the SLSW
accelerates electrons almost linearly. This radiation can be observed as a
radio knot at the upstream of the termination shock of the pulsar wind nebulae
without counter parts in higher frequency range.

vectors from a basis for the kernel of the linear map between the true and

Schofield and Bonner (2015) showed that a strict basis was sufficient for some

Markov basis can be difficult or impossible to compute for even moderate sized
studies. We address these issues by extending the LMM to separately model the

stacking clusters we determined how the disk-to-spheroid flux ratio varies with

problems, we introduce a multi-scale Monte Carlo method, where ions inside a

implicitly using continuum theory. Using the method of Debye charging, we
explicitly derive the effective interactions between ions inside the cavity,
arising due to the fluctuations of ions outside. We find that these effective
interactions consist of two types: 1) a constant cavity potential due to the
asymmetry of the electrolyte, and 2) a reaction potential that depends on the
positions of all ions inside. Combining the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC)

perform a multi-scale Monte Carlo simulation of symmetric electrolytes, and
compare it with other simulation methods, including PBC+GCMC method, as well as

conveyed to voters. Our voting model is constructed by using two types of
voters--herders and independents--and two candidates. Independents conduct
voting based on their fundamental values; on the other hand, herders base their
voting on the number of previous votes. Hence, herders vote for the majority
candidates and obtain information relating to previous votes from their
networks. We discuss the difference between the phases on which the networks
depend. Two kinds of phase transitions, an information cascade transition and a
super-normal transition, were identified. The first of these is a transition
between a state in which most voters make the correct choices and a state in
which most of them are wrong. The second is a transition of convergence speed.
The information cascade transition prevails when herder effects are stronger
than the super-normal transition. In the BA and fitness models, the critical
point of the information cascade transition is the same as that of the random
network model. However, the critical point of the super-normal transition
disappears when these two models are used. In conclusion, the influence of
networks is shown to only affect the convergence speed and not the information
cascade transition. We are therefore able to conclude that the influence of
hubs on voters' perceptions is limited.

us to study the Schwinger effect in the confining phase as well. A remarkable
feature of the Schwinger effect in the confining phase is to exhibit another
kind of the critical value, below which the pair production cannot occur and
the vacuum of the system is non-perturbatively stable. The critical value is
tantamount to the confining string tension. We computed the pair production

systems, all containing planets on ~ 1 AU orbits. We place bounds on the
locations in the circumbinary protoplanetary disk, where these planets could
have formed through collisional agglomeration starting from small (km-sized or
less) planetesimals. We first present a model of secular planetesimal dynamics
that accounts for the (1) perturbation due to the eccentric precessing binary,
as well as the (2) gravity and (3) gas drag from a precessing eccentric disk.
Their simultaneous action leads to rich dynamics, with (multiple) secular
resonances emerging in the disk. We derive analytic results for size-dependent
planetesimal eccentricity, and demonstrate the key role of the disk gravity for
circumbinary dynamics. We then combine these results with a simple model for
collisional outcomes and find that in systems like Kepler 16, planetesimal
growth starting with 10-100 m planetesimals is possible outside a few AU. The
exact location exterior to which this happens is sensitive to disk
eccentricity, density and precession rate, as well as to the size of the first
generation of planetesimals. Strong perturbations from the binary in the inner
part of the disk, combined with a secular resonance at a few AU inhibit the
growth of km-sized planetesimals within 2 - 4 AU of the binary. In situ
planetesimal growth in the Kepler circumbinary systems is possible only
starting from large (few-km-sized) bodies in a low-mass disk with surface

variants of the Allan deviation (ADEV) in dependence on the averaging time are
well established tools to analyse the fluctuation properties and frequency
instability of an oscillatory signal. It is often supposed that the statistical
uncertainty of a measured average frequency is given by the ADEV at a well
considered averaging time. However, this approach requires further mathematical
justification and refinement, which has already been done regarding the
original ADEV for certain noise types. Here we provide the necessary background
to use the modified Allan deviation (modADEV) and other two-sample deviations
to determine the uncertainty of weighted frequency averages. The type of
two-sample deviation used to determine the uncertainty depends on the method
used for determination of the average. We find that the modADEV, which is
connected with $\Lambda$-weighted averaging, and the two sample deviation
associated to a linear phase regression weighting (parADEV) are in particular
advantageous for measurements, in which white phase noise is dominating.
Furthermore, we derive a procedure how to minimize the uncertainty of a
measurement for a typical combination of white phase and frequency noise by
adaptive averaging of the data set with different weighting functions. Finally,
some aspects of the theoretical considerations for real-world frequency
measurement equipment are discussed.

scale vanishes or becomes smaller than the gravitational radius, the mechanism
should be absent. At the other extreme, if the Vainshtein scale is finite or
infinite, then the mechanism can operate. For consistency, if we define the
Vainshtein scale as an invariant, then we should expect the effective graviton

free to propagate. For clarity, here I analyze the effective mass behavior for

Filamentation (beam-Weibel) instabilities give rise to the growth of strong

Hitherto, the effects imposed by a spatial non-uniformity on filamentation
instabilities have remained unexplored. We examine the interaction between
spatially uniform background electrons and a minuscule cloud of electrons and
positrons. A square micro-cloud of equally dense electrons and positrons
impinges in our particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation on a spatially uniform plasma
at rest. The mean speed of the micro-cloud corresponds to a relativistic factor
of 15, which is relevant for laboratory experiments and for relativistic
astrophysical outflows. The spatial distributions of the leptons and of the
electromagnetic fields are examined at several times. A filamentation
instability develops between the magnetic field carried by the micro-cloud and
the background electrons. The electromagnetic fields, which grow from noise
levels, redistribute the electrons and positrons within the cloud, which boosts
the peak magnetic field amplitude. The current density and the moduli of the
electromagnetic fields grow aperiodically in time and steadily along the
direction that is anti-parallel to the cloud's velocity vector. The micro-cloud
remains conjoined during the simulation. The instability induces an
electrostatic wakefield in the background plasma.

susceptibility is highly correlated to nodes' influence, the topological
indicator k-shell can better identify highly susceptible individuals,
outperforming degree, betweenness centrality and PageRank. In contrast, in

is a manifestation of the modification of inertia at small accelerations.
Consistent with the Tully-Fisher relation, dynamics in the small acceleration
domain may originate from a quartic (cubic) velocity-dependence of energy
(momentum) whereas gravitational potentials remain linear with respect to mass.
The natural framework for this interpretation is Finsler geometry. The simplest
static isotropic Finsler metric of a gravitating mass that incorporates the
Tully-Fisher relation at small acceleration is associated with a spacetime
interval that is either a homogeneous quartic root of polynomials of local
displacements or a simple root of a rational fraction thereof. We determine the
low energy gravitational equation and find that Finsler spacetimes that produce
a Tully-Fisher relation require that the gravitational potential be modified.
For an isolated mass, Newton's potential $Mr^{-1}$ is replaced by $Ma_0\log
(r/r_0)$ where $a_0$ is MOND's acceleration scale and $r_0$ is a yet
undetermined distance scale. Orbital energy is linear with respect to mass but
angular momentum is proportional to $ M^{3/4}$. Asymptotic light deflection
resulting from time curvature is similar to that of a singular isothermal
sphere implying that space curvature must be the main source of deflection in
static Finsler spacetimes possibly through the presence of the distance scale
$r_0$ that appears in the asymptotic form of the gravitational potential. The
quartic nature of the Finsler metric hints at the existence of an underlying
area-metric that describes the effective structure of spacetime.

quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is currently unknown. Nevertheless, it is possible
to infer indirect information about these quantities. In this paper we
demonstrate an approach for constraining the form of spectral densities

expansion of the spectral representation with the operator product expansion
(OPE) of the propagators. As an application of this procedure we analyse the
scalar propagator in $\phi^4$-theory and the quark propagator in QCD, and show
that constraints are obtained on the spectral densities and the OPE

non-perturbative contributions to the quark condensate in QCD can be
decomposed, and that the non-perturbative contributions are related to the
structure of the continuum component of the scalar spectral density.

averaged the raw FITS files using a dedicated software. In this way we obtained
spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio, used to study the variation of the
CaII H&K lines and to have radial velocity values free from stellar
oscillations, without losing the oscillations information. We developed a
dedicated software to build a new custom mask that we used to refine the radial

time span of our observations. The correlation between the chromospheric
activity and the planetary orbital phase remains unclear. Solar-like

attention due to its utmost practical values in applications. Despite that
several individual-level diffusion data have been investigated, we still lack
the detailed understanding of the spreading pattern of information. Here, by
comparing information flows and social links in a blog community, we find that
the diffusion processes are induced by three different spreading mechanisms:
social spreading, self-promotion and broadcast. Although numerous previous
studies have employed epidemic spreading models to simulate information
diffusion, we observe that such models fail to reproduce the realistic
diffusion pattern. In respect to users behaviors, strikingly, we find that most
users would stick to one specific diffusion mechanism. Moreover, our
observations indicate that the social spreading is not only crucial for the
structure of diffusion trees, but also capable of inducing more subsequent
individuals to acquire the information. Our findings suggest new directions for
modeling of information diffusion in social systems and could inform design of
efficient propagation strategies based on users behaviors.

planetary atmospheric processes including thermal emission and reflected light,
while the impact of non-atmospheric (i.e. gravitational) processes, including
beaming (Doppler boosting) and tidal ellipsoidal distortion, is negligible.
Therefore, those systems allow a direct view of their atmospheres without being
hampered by the approximations used in the inclusion of both atmospheric and
non-atmospheric processes when modeling the phase curve shape. Here we analyze
Kepler-12b and Kepler-41b atmosphere based on their Kepler phase curve, while
the analysis of Kepler-7b was presented elsewhere. The model we used
efficiently computes reflection and thermal emission contributions to the phase
curve, including inhomogeneous atmospheric reflection due to longitudinally
varying cloud coverage. We confirm Kepler-12b and Kepler-41b show a westward
phase shift between the brightest region on the planetary surface and the
substellar point, similar to Kepler-7b. We find that reflective clouds located
on the west side of the substellar point can explain the phase shift. The
existence of inhomogeneous atmospheric reflection in all 3 of our targets,
selected due to their atmosphere-dominated Kepler phase curve, suggests this
phenomenon is common. Therefore it is likely to be present also in planetary
phase curves that do not allow a direct view of the planetary atmosphere as
they contain additional orbital processes. We discuss the implications of a
bright-spot shift on the analysis of phase curves where both atmospheric and
gravitational processes appear. We also discuss the potential detection of
non-transiting but otherwise similar planets, whose mass is too small to show a

the amplifying effect of excitable sensor networks, our method can better
detect small-scale spreading processes. At the same time, it can also
distinguish large-scale diffusion instances due to the self-inhibition effect
of excitable elements. Through simulations of diverse spreading dynamics on
typical real-world social networks (facebook, coauthor and email social

and ranking spreading processes in a much wider range of influence than other

coefficients relevant for a metal-free gas influence our ability to determine
the critical ultraviolet field strength required to suppress H2 cooling in
high-redshift atomic cooling halos. The suppression of H2 cooling is a
necessary prerequisite for the gas to undergo direct collapse and form an
intermediate mass black hole. These black holes can then act as seeds for the
growth of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z \sim
6$. The viability of this model for SMBH formation depends on the critical
ultraviolet field strength, Jcrit: if this is too large, then too few seeds
will form to explain the observed number density of SMBHs. We show in this
paper that there are five key chemical reactions whose rate coefficients are
uncertain enough to significantly affect Jcrit. The most important of these is
the collisional ionization of hydrogen by collisions with other hydrogen atoms,
as the rate for this process is very poorly constrained at the low energies
relevant for direct collapse. The total uncertainty introduced into Jcrit by
this and the other four reactions could in the worst case approach a factor of
five. We also show that the use of outdated or inappropriate values for the
rates of some chemical reactions in previous studies of the direct collapse
mechanism may have significantly affected the values of Jcrit determined by

Hinode, RHESSI, STEREO, and SDO, we can sample many solar layers from the
photosphere to the corona. A filament eruption was observed above a region of
previous flux emergence, which possibly led to a change in magnetic field
configuration, causing the X-flare. This was concluded from the timing and
location of the hard X-ray emission, which started to increase slightly less
than a minute after the filament accelerated. The filament showed Doppler
velocities of $\sim$2-5 km s$^{-1}$ at chromospheric temperatures for at least
one hour before the flare occurred, mostly blueshifts, but also redshifts near
its footpoints. 15 minutes before the flare, its chromospheric Doppler shifts
increased to $\sim$6-10 km s$^{-1}$ and plasma heating could be observed,
before it lifted off with at least 600 km s$^{-1}$, as seen in IRIS data.
Compared to previous studies, this acceleration ($\sim$3-5 km s$^{-2}$) is very
fast, while the velocities are in the common range for coronal mass ejections.
An interesting feature was a low-lying twisted second filament near the
erupting filament, which did not seem to participate in the eruption. After the
flare ribbons started on each of the second filament's sides, it seems to have
untangled and vanished during the flare. These observations are some of the
highest resolution data of an X-class flare to date and reveal some small-scale
features yet to be explained.

interpolation methods, an annihilating filter based low-rank Hankel matrix
approach (ALOHA) is proposed as a general framework for sparsity-driven k-space
interpolation method which unifies pMRI and CS-MRI. Specifically, our framework
is based on the fundamental duality between the transform domain sparsity in
the primary space and the low-rankness of weighted Hankel matrix in the
reciprocal space, which converts pMRI and CS-MRI to a k-space interpolation
problem using structured matrix completion. Using theoretical results from the
latest compressed sensing literatures, we showed that the required sampling
rates for ALOHA may achieve the optimal rate. Experimental results with in vivo
data for single/multi-coil imaging as well as dynamic imaging confirmed that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art pMRI and CS-MRI.

usually a difficult problem. Regularization techniques, such as the mapping to
complex coordinates or the addition of Complex Absorbing Potentials are
typically employed, as they render resonant wavefunctions localized and
therefore normalizable. Physically relevant metastable states have energies
that do not depend on the chosen regularization method. Their identification
therefore involves cumbersome comparisons between multiple regularised
calculations, often performed graphically, which require fine-tuning and
specific intuition to avoid approximated, if not wrong, results. In this
Letter, we define an operator that explicitly measures such invariance, valid
for any arbitrary mapping of spatial coordinates. Resonant states of the system
can eventually simply be identified evaluating the expectation value of this
operator. Our method eases the extraction of resonant states even for numerical
potentials that are difficult to scale to complex coordinates, and avoids the
need for ad hoc complex absorbing potentials. We provide explicit evidence of
our findings discussing one-dimensional case-studies,also in the presence of
external electric fields.

analyze a greedy HOOI, which updates each factor matrix by selecting from the

existence of a block-nondegenerate limit point, we establish its global
convergence through the so-called Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property. In

block-nondegenerate globally optimal solution, the greedy HOOI produces a
sequence convergent to a globally optimal solution. Relating the iterate
sequence by the original HOOI to that by the greedy HOOI, we then show that the
same convergence results hold for the original HOOI and thus positively address

consider diffusion-like paths that are explored by a particle moving via a
conservative force while being in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.
Instead of considering diffusion (Brownian dynamics), we use a Metropolis
algorithm to derive an OM-like functional. Through the lens of the Metropolis
algorithm, we are able to elucidate the errors made when using a nonzero time
increment.
  Of particular interest are transition paths that transverse an energy barrier
that is large (but not too large) compared to the typical thermal energy. These
transitions have probabilities that are only small and yet not so small as to
be considered a violation of thermodynamics. As such, we turn our attention to
the ""double-ended"" problem, where the OM functional can be interpreted as a
""thermodynamic"" action and employed to sample paths that start and end at
predetermined points. We find that sampling the continuous-time limit of the OM
functional, i.e., the Ito-Girsanov form, produces unphysical paths due to
thermodynamic inconsistency arising from the singular nature of the limit.
These unphysical effects are due to the correlation between the particles
position and the random fluctuating noise that is introduced in the limiting
process. Such a correlation is a direct consequence of the form of the
Ito-Girsanov functional, does not originate from numerical inaccuracies, and is
a violation of thermodynamics as embodied by Seifert's Integral Fluctuation
Theorem.

success story of recent NLP research. However, developing models that learn
useful representations of phrases and sentences has proved far harder. We
propose using the definitions found in everyday dictionaries as a means of
bridging this gap between lexical and phrasal semantics. Neural language
embedding models can be effectively trained to map dictionary definitions
(phrases) to (lexical) representations of the words defined by those
definitions. We present two applications of these architectures: ""reverse

description and general-knowledge crossword question answerers. On both tasks,
neural language embedding models trained on definitions from a handful of
freely-available lexical resources perform as well or better than existing
commercial systems that rely on significant task-specific engineering. The
results highlight the effectiveness of both neural embedding architectures and
definition-based training for developing models that understand phrases and

aspects : high speed, infortainment, intelligence in driving, and so on. In

high speed amongst several techno-savvy countries is becoming severe. To
achieve high speed, engines or motors are distributed over multiple vehicles of
train to provide increased motive power, while a single engine or motor has
been mostly used for conventional trains. Increased speed and more complicated
powertrain system naturally incur much higher chance of massive accidents. From
this perspective, importance of proactive safety control before accident takes
place cannot be over-emphasized. To implement proactive safety control requires
situation-aware integration and transmission of safety information obtained
from IoT sensors. Types of critical IoT sensors depend on situational
conditions. Thus, integration and transmission of safety information should be
performed with IoT sensors providing the safety information proper for faced

single-letter characterization of the optimal rate region is established, and
for several important special cases, closed-form solutions are given, including
the scenario of uniformly distributed user requests. In this case, it is shown
that the optimal caching strategy is closely related to total correlation and

three two-user scenarios admitting single-letter characterization are
considered, which draw connections to existing source coding problems in the

bioinformatics pipelines. As a consequence, the sensitivity and precision of
the mapping tool, applied with certain parameters to certain data, can
critically affect the accuracy of produced results (e.g., in variant calling
applications). Therefore, there has been an increasing demand of methods for
comparing mappers and for measuring effects of their parameters.
  Read simulators combined with alignment evaluation tools provide the most
straightforward way to evaluate and compare mappers. Simulation of reads is
accompanied by information about their positions in the source genome. This
information is then used to evaluate alignments produced by the mapper.
Finally, reports containing statistics of successful read alignments are
created.
  In default of standards for encoding read origins, every evaluation tool has
to be made explicitly compatible with the simulator used to generate reads. In
order to solve this obstacle, we have created a generic format RNF (Read Naming
Format) for assigning read names with encoded information about original
positions.
  Futhermore, we have developed an associated software package RNF containing
two principal components. MIShmash applies one of popular read simulating tools
(among DwgSim, Art, Mason, CuReSim etc.) and transforms the generated reads
into RNF format. LAVEnder evaluates then a given read mapper using simulated
reads in RNF format. A special attention is payed to mapping qualities that
serve for parametrization of ROC curves, and to evaluation of the effect of
read sample contamination.

analysis of the electrohydrodynamic flow (EHD) for the problem of
electroconvection in the strong injection region. Convective cells are formed
by Coulomb force in an insulating liquid residing between two plane electrodes
subject to unipolar injection. Besides pure electroconvection, we also consider
the case where a cross-flow is present, generated by a streamwise pressure
gradient, in the form of a laminar Poiseuille flow. The effect of charge
diffusion, often neglected in previous linear stability analyses, is included
in the present study and a transient growth analysis, rarely considered in EHD,
is carried out. In the case without cross-flow, a non-zero charge diffusion
leads to a lower linear stability threshold and thus to a more unstable low.
The transient growth, though enhanced by increasing charge diffusion, remains
small and hence cannot fully account for the discrepancy of the linear
stability threshold between theoretical and experimental results. When a
cross-flow is present, increasing the strength of the electric field in the
high-$Re$ Poiseuille flow yields a more unstable flow in both modal and
nonmodal stability analyses. Even though the energy analysis and the
input-output analysis both indicate that the energy growth directly related to
the electric field is small, the electric effect enhances the lift-up
mechanism. The symmetry of channel flow with respect to the centerline is
broken due to the additional electric field acting in the wall-normal
direction. As a result, the centers of the streamwise rolls are shifted towards
the injector electrode, and the optimal spanwise wavenumber achieving maximum
transient energy growth increases with the strength of the electric field.

study variability over multiple timescales. We calculate accretion rates for
each epoch of observations using the STIS spectra and find that those separated
by one week had similar accretion rates (~1E-8 solar masses/yr) while the epoch
obtained 3 months later had a substantially lower accretion rate (~4E-9 solar
masses/yr). We find that the decline in accretion rate is caused by lower
densities of material in the accretion flows, as opposed to a lower surface
coverage of the accretion columns. During the low accretion rate epoch we also
observe lower fluxes at both far UV (FUV) and IR wavelengths, which trace
molecular gas and dust in the disk, respectively. We find that this can be
explained by a lower dust and gas mass in the inner disk. We attribute the
observed variability to inhomogeneities in the inner disk, near the corotation
radius, where gas and dust may co-exist near the footprints of the
magnetospheric flows. These FUV--NIR data offer a new perspective on the
structure of the inner disk, the stellar magnetosphere, and their interaction.

magnitude is comparable to the YORP effect due to the global shape. We solve a
three-dimensional heat diffusion equation in a boulder and its surroundings by
the finite element method, using the FreeFem++ code. The contribution to the
total torque is inferred from the computed temperature distribution. Our
general approach allows us to compute the torque induced by a realistic
irregular boulder. For an idealized boulder, our result is consistent with an
existing one-dimensional model. We also estimated (and extrapolated) a size
distribution of boulders on (25143) Itokawa from close-up images of its

systematically: we consider the moduli space of curves $C$ with a line bundle
$L$ such that $L^{\otimes\ell}\cong\omega_C^{\otimes k}$. New loci of canonical

kiloparsec-scale jets associated with powerful quasars in which the X-ray
fluxes are observed to be much higher than the expected level based on the
radio-optical synchrotron spectrum. The most popular explanation for the
anomalously high and hard X-ray fluxes is that these jets do not decelerate
significantly by the kiloparsec scale, but rather remain highly relativistic
(Lorentz factors $\Gamma\approx$10). By adopting a small angle to the
line-of-sight, the X-rays can thus be explained by inverse Compton upscattering
of CMB photons (IC/CMB), where the observed emission is strongly Doppler
boosted. Using over six years of Fermi monitoring data, we show that the
expected hard, steady gamma-ray emission implied by the IC/CMB model is not
seen in PKS 0637-752, the prototype jet for which this model was first
proposed. IC/CMB emission is thus ruled out as the source of the X-rays,
joining recent results for the jets in 3C 273 (using the same method; Meyer et
al. 2014) and PKS 1136-135 (using UV polarization; Cara et al., 2013). We
further show that the Fermi observations give an upper limit of $\delta<$6.5
for the four brightest X-ray knots of PKS 0637-752, and derive an updated limit
of $\delta<$7.8 for knots A and B1 of 3C 273 (assuming equipartition). Finally,
we discuss the fact that high levels of synchrotron X-ray emission in a slow
jet will unavoidably lead to a level of angle-integrated TeV emission which
exceeds that of the TeV BL Lac class.

Ocean. Turbulence at this location is strongly affected by the semidiurnal
tidal wave. Mean stratification is stable in the entire dataset. We compute
structure functions, of order up to 10, of the distributions of temperature
increments. Strong intermittency is observed, in particular, during the
downslope phase of the tide, and farther from the solid bottom. In the lower
half of the mooring during the upslope phase, the temperature statistics are
consistent with those of a passive scalar. In the upper half of the mooring,
the temperature statistics deviate from those of a passive scalar, and evidence
of turbulent convective activity is found. The downslope phase is generally
thought to be more shear-dominated, but our results suggest on the other hand
that convective activity is present. High-order moments also show that the
turbulence scaling behaviour breaks at a well-defined scale (of the order of
the buoyancy length scale), which is however dependent on the flow state (tidal
phase, height above the bottom). At larger scales, wave motions are dominant.
We suggest that our results could provide an important reference for laboratory
and numerical studies of mixing in geophysical flows.

optimized linac and recirculation lattice to a dramatically better optimum.
  The prime accelerator science motivation for C$\beta$ is proving that the
FFAG-ERL concept works. This is an important milestone for the Brookhaven
National Laboratory (BNL) plans to build a major Nuclear Physics facility,
eRHIC, based on producing 21 GeV electron beams to collide with the RHIC ion
beams. A consequence of the C$\beta$ work would be the availability of
significantly better, cost-effective, compact CW high-brightness electron beams
for a plethora of scientific investigations and applications, such as X-ray
sources, dark-matter and dark-energy searches, and industrial high-power
Free-Electron Laser (FEL) applications.
  C$\beta$ brings together the resources and expertise of a large DOE National
Laboratory, BNL, and a leading research university, Cornell. C$\beta$ will be
built in an existing building at Cornell, for the most part using components
that have been developed under previous R&D programs, including a fully
commissioned world-leading photoemission electron injector, a large SRF
accelerator module, and a high-power beam stop. The only elements that require
design and construction from scratch is the FFAG magnet transport lattice.
  This white paper describes a project that promises to propel high-power,
high-brightness electron beam science and applications to an exciting new
level.

whose dynamics, represented by time series of activity, is more strongly
correlated internally than with the rest of the system. Recent studies have
shown that the binary projections of various financial and neural time series
exhibit nontrivial dynamical features that resemble those of the original data.
This implies that a significant piece of information is encoded into the binary
projection (i.e. the sign) of such increments. Here, we explore whether the
binary signatures of multiple time series can replicate the same complex
community organization of the financial market, as the original weighted time
series. We adopt a method that has been specifically designed to detect
communities from cross-correlation matrices of time series data. Our analysis
shows that the simpler binary representation leads to a community structure
that is almost identical with that obtained using the full weighted

parallelism. Modern big-data problems are often well suited for stream
processing's throughput-oriented nature. Realization of efficient stream
processing requires monitoring and optimization of multiple communications
links. Most techniques to optimize these links use queueing network models or
network flow models, which require some idea of the actual execution rate of
each independent compute kernel within the system. What we want to know is how
fast can each kernel process data independent of other communicating kernels.
This is known as the ""service rate"" of the kernel within the queueing
literature. Current approaches to divining service rates are static. Modern
workloads, however, are often dynamic. Shared cloud systems also present
applications with highly dynamic execution environments (multiple users,
hardware migration, etc.). It is therefore desirable to continuously re-tune an
application during run time (online) in response to changing conditions. Our
approach enables online service rate monitoring under most conditions,
obviating the need for reliance on steady state predictions for what are
probably non-steady state phenomena. First, some of the difficulties associated
with online service rate determination are examined. Second, the algorithm to
approximate the online non-blocking service rate is described. Lastly, the
algorithm is implemented within the open source RaftLib framework for
validation using a simple microbenchmark as well as two full streaming

are detected in the rest-frame UV (280 nm), regardless of their star-formation
activity, because evolved stellar populations produce a modest amount of UV
light that traces the relatively smooth, symmetric, and centrally peaked
stellar distribution seen in the near infrared. Ultraviolet morphologies among
the BCGs with strong UV excesses exhibit distinctive knots, multiple elongated
clumps, and extended filaments of emission that distinctly differ from the
smooth profiles of the UV-quiet BCGs. These structures, which are similar to
those seen in the few star-forming BCGs observed in the UV at low redshift, are
suggestive of bi-polar streams of clumpy star formation, but not of spiral arms
or large, kpc-scale disks. Based on the number of streams and lack of culprit
companion galaxies, these streams are unlikely to have arisen from multiple
collisions with gas-rich galaxies. These star-forming UV structures are
morphologically similar to the cold-gas structures produced in simulations of
precipitation-driven AGN feedback in which jets uplift low-entropy gas to
greater altitudes, causing it to condense. Unobscured star-formation rates
estimated from CLASH UV images using the Kennicutt relation range up to 80

roots is generated by a system of real polynomials having only real roots and

co-workers have shown that the real radical ideal of real polynomial systems
with finitely many real solutions can be determined by a combination of
semi-definite programming (SDP) and geometric involution techniques. A
conjectured extension of such methods to positive dimensional polynomial
systems has been given recently by Ma, Wang and Zhi.
  We show that regularity in the form of the Slater constraint qualification
(strict feasibility) fails for the resulting SDP feasibility problems. Facial
reduction is then a popular technique whereby SDP problems that fail strict
feasibility can be regularized by projecting onto a face of the convex cone of
semi-definite problems.
  In this paper we introduce a framework for combining facial reduction with
such SDP methods for analyzing $0$ and positive dimensional real ideals of real
polynomial systems. The SDP methods are implemented in MATLAB and our geometric
involutive form is implemented in Maple. We use two approaches to find a
feasible moment matrix. We use an interior point method within the CVX package
for MATLAB and also the Douglas-Rachford (DR) projection-reflection method.
  Illustrative examples show the advantages of the DR approach for some
problems over standard interior point methods. We also see the advantage of
facial reduction both in regularizing the problem and also in reducing the
dimension of the moment matrices. Problems requiring more than one facial
reduction are also presented.

the conventional cross-correlation coefficient. We demonstrate the advantage of
the DPXA coefficients over the DCCA coefficients by analyzing contaminated
bivariate fractional Brownian motions. We calculate the DPXA coefficients and
use them to extract the intrinsic cross-correlation between crude oil and gold
futures by taking into consideration the impact of the US dollar index. We
develop the multifractal DPXA (MF-DPXA) method in order to generalize the DPXA
method and investigate multifractal time series. We analyze multifractal
binomial measures masked with strong white noises and find that the MF-DPXA
method quantifies the hidden multifractal nature while the MF-DCCA method
fails.

  in dilated polygons",,,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $C$ be a convex $d$-dimensional body. If $\rho$ is a large positive
number, then the dilated body $\rho C$ contains $\rho^{d}\left\vert
C\right\vert +\mathcal{O}\left( \rho^{d-1}\right) $ integer points, where
$\left\vert C\right\vert $ denotes the volume of $C$. The above error estimate
$\mathcal{O}\left( \rho^{d-1}\right) $ can be improved in several cases. We are
interested in the $L^{2}$-discrepancy $D_{C}(\rho)$ of a copy of $\rho C$
thrown at random in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. More precisely, we consider \[
D_{C}(\rho):=\left\{ \int_{\mathbb{T}^{d}}\int_{SO(d)}\left\vert
\textrm{card}\left( \left( \rho\sigma(C)+t\right) \cap\mathbb{Z}^d\right) -
\rho^{d}\left\vert C\right\vert \right\vert ^{2}d\sigma dt\right\} ^{1/2}\ , \]
where $\mathbb{T}^{d}=$ $\mathbb{R}^{d}/\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ is the $d$-dimensional
flat torus and $SO\left( d\right) $ is the special orthogonal group of real
orthogonal matrices of determinant $1$.
  An argument of D. Kendall shows that $D_{C}(\rho)\leq c\ \rho^{(d-1)/2}$. If
$C$ also satisfies the reverse inequality $\ D_{C}(\rho)\geq c_{1} \
\rho^{(d-1)/2}$, we say that $C$ is $L^{2}$\emph{-regular}. L. Parnovski and A.
Sobolev proved that, if $d>1$, a $d$-dimensional unit ball is $L^{2}% $-regular
if and only if $d\not \equiv 1\ (\operatorname{mod}4)$.
  In this paper we characterize the $L^{2}$-regular convex polygons. More
precisely we prove that a convex polygon is not $L^{2}$-regular if and only if
it can be inscribed in a circle and it is symmetric about the centre.
