stability of the resulting feature extractor. The purpose of this paper is to
develop Mallat's theory further by allowing for different and, most
importantly, general semi-discrete frames (such as, e.g., Gabor frames,
wavelets, curvelets, shearlets, ridgelets) in distinct network layers. This
allows to extract wider classes of features than point singularities resolved
by the wavelet transform. Our generalized feature extractor is proven to be
translation-invariant, and we develop deformation stability results for a
larger class of deformations than those considered by Mallat. For Mallat's
wavelet-based feature extractor, we get rid of a number of technical
conditions. The mathematical engine behind our results is continuous frame
theory, which allows us to completely detach the invariance and deformation
stability proofs from the particular algebraic structure of the underlying
frames.

information is available at the transmitter side (delayed CSIT). Recent works
have proposed schemes that achieve increasing DoF values, but at the cost of

strategies, formulated in such a way that the achievable DoF can be derived as
a function of the transmission delay, thus elucidating its achievable DoF-delay

and built upon three main ingredients: delayed CSIT precoding, user scheduling,
and redundancy transmission. In this respect, the interference alignment is
realized by exploiting delayed CSIT in order to align the interference at the
non-intended receivers along the space-time domain. Finally, the latter part of
this work settles that all the proposed strategies work also for constant
channels, except for SISO. In such a case, the schemes can be made feasible by
resorting to asymmetric complex signaling concepts. This conclusion removes the

bispectrum. On the other hand, the primordial trispectra characterized by
$g_{\rm NL} ^{\dot{\sigma}^2 (\partial \sigma)^2}$ and $g_{\rm NL} ^{(\partial

With such purpose the paper describes how to implement an Artificial Neural

described in detail, and the challenge was how to implement a computational
demanding algorithm in a simple architecture with very few hardware resources.

configuration space $\overline\Gamma$, formed by the field vectors and the
velocity of the medium, which satisfy the Minkowski constitutive relations. It
should be emphasized that the 3-dimensional vector formulae for the components
of the energy-momentum tensor were obtained by Abraham only on
$\overline\Gamma$, and the task of their extension to the whole unconditional
configuration space $\Gamma$ was not posed. In order to accomplish the

one to treat the explicitly covariant formula as a unique consistent extension

question concerning the relativistic covariance of the original 3-dimensional
Abraham formulae defined on $\overline\Gamma$ is solved positively. We discuss

impose growing requirements over Quality of Service (QoS), including bandwidth,
delay, jitter, etc. Meanwhile, networks are expected to be load-balanced,
energy-efficient, and resilient to some degree of failures. It is observed that
the above requirements could be better met with multiple disjoint QoS paths
than a single one. Let $G=(V,\, E)$ be a digraph with nonnegative integral cost
and delay on every edge, $s,\, t\in V$ be two specified vertices, and
$D\in\mathbb{Z}_{0}^{+}$ be a delay bound (or some other constraint), the
\emph{$k$ Disjoint Restricted Shortest Path} ($k$\emph{RSP})\emph{ Problem} is
computing $k$ disjoint paths between $s$ and $t$ with total cost minimized and
total delay bounded by $D$. Few efficient algorithms have been developed
because of the hardness of the problem.
  In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms with provable performance
guarantees for the $k$RSP problem. We first present a pseudo-polynomial-time
approximation algorithm with a bifactor approximation ratio of $(1,\,2)$, then
improve the algorithm to polynomial time with a bifactor ratio of
$(1+\epsilon,\,2+\epsilon)$ for any fixed $\epsilon>0$, which is better than
the current best approximation ratio $(O(1+\gamma),\, O(1+\frac{1}{\gamma})\})$
for any fixed $\gamma>0$ \cite{orda2004efficient}. To the best of our

obeys the constraint for the $k$RSP problem.

to efficient action recognition and detection. We first propose to improve the
popular dense trajectory features by explicit camera motion estimation. More
specifically, we extract feature point matches between frames using SURF
descriptors and dense optical flow. The matches are used to estimate a
homography with RANSAC. To improve the robustness of homography estimation, a
human detector is employed to remove outlier matches from the human body as
human motion is not constrained by the camera. Trajectories consistent with the
homography are considered as due to camera motion, and thus removed. We also
use the homography to cancel out camera motion from the optical flow. This
results in significant improvement on motion-based HOF and MBH descriptors. We
further explore the recent Fisher vector as an alternative feature encoding
approach to the standard bag-of-words histogram, and consider different ways to
include spatial layout information in these encodings. We present a large and
varied set of evaluations, considering (i) classification of short basic
actions on six datasets, (ii) localization of such actions in feature-length
movies, and (iii) large-scale recognition of complex events. We find that our
improved trajectory features significantly outperform previous dense

we aim to study therefore, how local phase perturbations which may be caused by

from nonlinear power balance equations and map them to complex linear wave
equations, yielding stationary solutions with phases $\varphi_i$ at generator
and consumer sites $i$. Next, we study deviations from these stationary
solutions. Starting with an initially localized perturbation, it is found to
spread in a periodic grid diffusively throughout the grid. We derive the
parametric dependence of diffusion constant $D$. We apply the same solution
strategy to general grid topologies and analyse their stability against local
perturbations. The perturbation remains either localized or becomes
delocalized, depending on grid topology, power capacity and distribution of
consumers and generators $P_i$. Delocalization is found to increase the
lifetime of perturbations and thereby their influence on grid stability, while
localization results in an exponentiallyfast decay of perturbations at all grid
sites. These results may therefore lead to new strategies to control the

defined by a purely type-theoretic contractibility condition which replaces the
standard, category-theoretic universal property involving the existence and
uniqueness of appropriate morphisms. Our main result characterises the types
that are equivalent to W-types as homotopy-initial algebras.

is thrown into a black hole a long time after an early infalling string. Light
cone gauge calculations, taken at face value, indicate a detectable level of
root-mean-square longitudinal spreading of the initial string as measured by
the late infaller. This results from the large relative boost between the
string and detector in the near horizon region, which develops automatically
despite their modest initial energies outside the black hole and the weak
curvature in the geometry. We subject this scenario to basic consistency
checks, using these to obtain a relatively conservative criterion for its
detectability. In a companion paper, we exhibit longitudinal nonlocality in
well-defined gauge-invariant S-matrix calculations, obtaining results
consistent with the predicted spreading albeit not in a direct analogue of the
black hole process. We discuss applications of this effect to the firewall
paradox, and estimate the time and distance scales it predicts for new physics

Using wavepackets to localize the asymptotic states, we compute the peak
trajectories followed by the incoming and outgoing strings, determined by the
phases in the amplitudes. These trajectories trace back in all dimensions such
that the incoming strings deflect directly into corresponding outgoing ones, as
expected from a Reggeon analysis. Bremsstrahlung radiation at five points
emerges from the deflection point, corroborating this picture. An explicit
solution for the intermediate state produced at four points in the $s$-channel
exists, with endpoints precisely following the corresponding geometry and a
periodicity which matches the series of time delays predicted by the amplitude.
We find a nonzero peak impact parameter for this process, and show that it
admits an interpretation in terms of longitudinal-spreading induced string
joining, at the scale expected from light cone calculations, and does not
appear to admit a straightforward interpretation purely in terms of the
well-established transverse spreading. At five points, we exhibit a regime with
advanced emission of one of the deflected outgoing strings. This strongly
suggests early interaction induced by longitudinal nonlocality. In a companion

each prediction in a set of predictions to other predictions in the set at a
later time. TD networks can represent and apply TD learning to a much wider
class of predictions than has previously been possible. Using a random-walk
example, we show that these networks can be used to learn to predict by a fixed
interval, which is not possible with conventional TD methods. Secondly, we show
that if the inter-predictive relationships are made conditional on action, then
the usual learning-efficiency advantage of TD methods over Monte Carlo

demonstrate that TD networks can learn predictive state representations that
enable exact solution of a non-Markov problem. A very broad range of
inter-predictive temporal relationships can be expressed in these networks.

scenario consists of adopting the magnetic flux function as the basic dynamical
variable. Such a representation of the dynamics allows to make account of the
co-rotation theorem as a fundamental feature of the ideal plasma equilibrium,
evaluating its impact on the perturbation evolution too. According to the
Alfvenic nature of the Magneto-rotational instability, we consider an
incompressible plasma profile and perturbations propagating along the
background magnetic field. Furthermore, we develop a local perturbation
analysis, around fiducial coordinates of the background configuration and
dealing with very small scale of the linear dynamics in comparison to the
background inhomogeneity size. The main issue of the present study is that the
condition for the emergence of unstable modes is the same in the stratified
plasma disk, as in the case of a thin configuration. Such a feature is the
result of the cancelation of the vertical derivative of the disk angular
frequency from the dispersion relation, which implies that only the radial
profile of the differential rotation is responsible for the trigger of growing
modes.

general metric spaces and Euclidean space. We present the first polylogarithmic
space $O(1)$-approximation to the metric $k$-median and metric $k$-means
problems in the sliding window model, answering the main open problem posed by
Babcock, Datar, Motwani and O'Callaghan, which has remained unanswered for over
a decade. Our algorithm uses $O(k^3 \log^6 n)$ space and
$\operatorname{poly}(k, \log n)$ update time. This is an exponential
improvement on the space required by the technique due to Babcock, et al. We
introduce a data structure that extends smooth histograms as introduced by
Braverman and Ostrovsky to operate on a broader class of functions. In
particular, we show that using only polylogarithmic space we can maintain a
summary of the current window from which we can construct an $O(1)$-approximate
clustering solution.
  Merge-and-reduce is a generic method in computational geometry for adapting
offline algorithms to the insertion-only streaming model. Several well-known
coreset constructions are maintainable in the insertion-only streaming model
using this method, including well-known coreset techniques for the $k$-median,
$k$-means in both low-and high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Previous work has
adapted these techniques to the insertion-deletion model, but translating them
to the sliding window model has remained a challenge. We give the first
algorithm that, given an insertion-only streaming coreset construction of space
$s$, maintains a $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximate coreset in the sliding window
model using $O(s^2\epsilon^{-2}\log n)$ space.
  For clustering problems, our results constitute the first significant step
towards resolving problem number 20 from the List of Open Problems in Sublinear

that the antiproton flux from the wino annihilation can explain the observed

particularly well compared to the case without the annihilation for the thermal

photoevaporation rates predicted by models differ by up to two orders of
magnitude, resulting in uncertain time scales for the final stages of disk
clearing. Photoevaporation theories predict that the final stages of
disk-clearing progress in objects that have ceased accretion but still posses
considerable material at radii far from the star. Weak-line T Tauri stars
(WTTS) with infrared excess are likely in this configuration. We aim to provide
observational constraints on theories of disk-clearing by measuring the dust
masses and CO content of a sample of young (1.8-26.3 Myr) WTTS. We used ALMA
Band 6 to obtain continuum and 12 CO(2-1) line fluxes for a sample of 24 WTTS
stars with known infrared excess. We detect continuum emission in only four of
24 WTTS, and no 12 CO(2-1) emission in any. For those WTTS where no continuum
was detected, their ages and derived upper limits suggest they are debris
disks, which makes them some of the youngest debris disks known. Of those where
continuum was detected, three are possible photoevaporating disks, although the
lack of CO detection suggests a severely reduced gas-to-dust ratio. The low
fraction of continuum detections implies that, once accretion onto the star
stops, the clearing of the majority of dust progresses very rapidly. Most WTTS
with infrared excess are likely not in transition but are instead young debris
disks, whose dust is either primordial and has survived disk-clearing, or is of
second-generation origin.

adaptive multicarrier quadrature division (AMQD) scheme. We define direct GQI
(DGQI), and prove that it achieves a theoretical minimal magnitude error. We
introduce the terms statistical secret key rate and statistical private
classical information, which quantities are derived purely by the statistical
functions of GQI. We prove the secret key rate formulas for a multiple access
multicarrier CVQKD via the AMQD-MQA (multiuser quadrature allocation) scheme.
The GQI and DGQI frameworks can be established in an arbitrary CVQKD protocol
and measurement setting, and are implementable by standard low-complexity
statistical functions, which is particularly convenient for an experimental
CVQKD scenario.

test masses nearly in free fall is at the heart of gravitational wave
detection. It is envisaged that the derivative of the frequency shift is in
fact limited by differential forces acting on those test masses. We calculate
the derivative of the frequency shift with a fully covariant, gauge-independent
and coordinate-free method. This method is general and does not require a
congruence of nearby beams' null geodesics as done in previous work. We show
that the derivative of the parallel transport is the only means by which
gravitational effects shows up in the frequency shift. This contribution is
given as an integral of the Riemann tensor --the only physical observable of
curvature-- along the beam's geodesic. The remaining contributions are: the
difference of velocities, the difference of non-gravitational forces, and
finally fictitious forces, either locally at the test masses or non-locally
integrated along the beam's geodesic. As an application relevant to
gravitational wave detection, we work out the frequency shift in the local
Lorentz frame of nearby geodesics.

(so-called galactic conformity) have been observed for projected separations up
to 4 Mpc, an effect not predicted by current semi-analytic models. We
investigate correlations between the mass accretion rates (dMvir/dt) of nearby
halos as a potential physical origin for this effect. We find that pairs of
host halos ""know about"" each others' assembly histories even when their
present-day separation is greater than thirty times the virial radius of either
halo. These distances are far too large for direct interaction between the
halos to explain the correlation in their dMvir/dt. Instead, halo pairs at
these distances reside in the same large-scale tidal environment, which
regulates dMvir/dt for both halos. Larger halos are less affected by external
forces, which naturally gives rise to a mass dependence of the halo conformity
signal. SDSS measurements of galactic conformity exhibit a qualitatively
similar dependence on stellar mass, including how the signal varies with
distance. Based on the expectation that halo accretion and galaxy SFR are
correlated, we predict the scale-, mass- and redshift-dependence of large-scale
galactic conformity, finding that the signal should drop to undetectable levels
by z > 1. These predictions are testable with current surveys to z ~ 1;
confirmation would establish a strong correlation between dark matter halo
accretion rate and central galaxy SFR.

studies have historically selected samples of galaxies using a physical
quantity, such as stellar mass, either above a constant limit or at a constant
cumulative number density. Investigation into the efficacy of these selection

based on the output of the Millennium Simulation, we find that selecting
galaxies at a constant number density (in the range $-4.3 < \log\ n\
[\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}\ h^{3}] < -3.0$) is superior to a constant stellar mass
selected sample, although it still has significant limitations. Recovery of the
average stellar mass, stellar mass density and average star-formation rate is
highly dependent on the choice of number density but can all be recovered to
within $<50\%$ at the commonly employed choice of $\log\ n\ [\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}\

observation of one of these transients, SN 2012hn, to place weak upper limits
on the detonator mass of this system that include all intermediate-mass BHs
(IMBHs). As these transients are preferentially in the stellar haloes of
galaxies, we discuss the possibility that these transients are tidal
detonations of WDs caused by random flyby encounters with IMBHs in dwarf
galaxies or globular clusters. This possibility has been already suggested in
the literature but without connection to the calcium-rich gap transients. In
order for the random flyby cross-section to be high enough, these events would
have to be occurring inside these dense stellar associations. However, there is
a lack of evidence for IMBHs in these systems, and recent observations have
ruled out all but the very faintest dwarf galaxies and globular clusters for a
few of these transients. Another possibility is that these are tidal
detonations caused by three-body interactions, where a WD is perturbed toward
the detonator in isolated multiple star systems. We highlight a number of ways
this could occur, even in lower-mass systems with stellar-mass BHs or neutron

formation shuts off in the tails as the gas is used up or dispersed. There are
a few clusters in each tail with estimated ages that are older than the modeled

ratio (C/O $>$ 1), suggesting it had a different formation pathway than is
commonly assumed for giant planets. Here we report a precise near-infrared
transmission spectrum for WASP-12b based on six transit observations with the
Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3. We bin the data in 13
spectrophotometric light curves from 0.84 - 1.67 $\mu$m and measure the transit
depths to a median precision of 51 ppm. We retrieve the atmospheric properties
using the transmission spectrum and find strong evidence for water absorption
(7$\sigma$ confidence). This detection marks the first high-confidence,
spectroscopic identification of a molecule in the atmosphere of WASP-12b. The
retrieved 1$\sigma$ water volume mixing ratio is between $10^{-5}-10^{-2}$,
which is consistent with C/O $>$ 1 to within 2$\sigma$. However, we also
introduce a new retrieval parameterization that fits for C/O and metallicity
under the assumption of chemical equilibrium. With this approach, we constrain
C/O to $0.5^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ at $1\,\sigma$ and rule out a carbon-rich atmosphere
composition (C/O$>1$) at $>3\sigma$ confidence. Further observations and
modeling of the planet's global thermal structure and dynamics would aid in
resolving the tension between our inferred C/O and previous constraints. Our
findings highlight the importance of obtaining high-precision data with
multiple observing techniques in order to obtain robust constraints on the

65% of known lenses, while the new candidates show a richer variety compared to
those found by the two robots. This detection rate could be increased to 80% by
only using classifications performed by expert volunteers (albeit at the cost
of a lower purity), indicating that the training and performance calibration of
the citizen scientists is very important for the success of Space Warps. In

investigate whether disk wind models that produce realistic UV line profiles

continuum emission in the optical waveband. We also test whether outflows may
be responsible for the single-peaked emission line profiles often seen in
high-state CVs and for the weakness of the Balmer absorption edge (relative to
simple models of optically thick accretion disks). We find that a standard disk
wind model that is successful in reproducing the UV spectra of CVs also leaves
a noticeable imprint on the optical spectrum, particularly for systems viewed
at high inclination. The strongest optical wind-formed recombination lines are
H$\alpha$ and He II $\lambda4686$. We demonstrate that a higher-density outflow
model produces all the expected H and He lines and produces a recombination
continuum that can fill in the Balmer jump at high inclinations. This model
displays reasonable verisimilitude with the optical spectrum of RW Trianguli.
No single-peaked emission is seen, although we observe a narrowing of the
double-peaked emission lines from the base of the wind. Finally, we show that
even denser models can produce a single-peaked H$\alpha$ line. On the basis of

density contrast $\Delta$ relative to a reference (mean or critical) density.
We argue that a more physical boundary of halos is the radius at which accreted
matter reaches its first orbital apocenter after turnaround. This splashback
radius, $R_{sp}$, manifests itself as a sharp density drop in the halo
outskirts, at a location that depends upon the mass accretion rate. We present
calibrations of $R_{sp}$ and the enclosed mass, $M_{sp}$, as a function of the
accretion rate and alternatively peak height. We find that $R_{sp}$ varies
between $\approx0.8-1R_{200m}$ for rapidly accreting halos and
$\approx1.5R_{200m}$ for slowly accreting halos. The extent of a halo and its
associated environmental effects can thus extend well beyond the conventionally
defined ""virial"" radius. We show that $M_{sp}$ and $R_{sp}$ evolve relatively
strongly compared to other commonly used definitions. In particular, $M_{sp}$
evolves significantly even for the smallest dwarf-sized halos at $z=0$. We also
contrast $M_{sp}$ with the mass enclosed within four scale radii of the halo
density profile, $M_{<4rs}$, which characterizes the inner halo. During the
early stages of halo assembly, $M_{sp}$ and $M_{<4rs}$ evolve similarly, but in
the late stages $M_{<4rs}$ stops increasing while $M_{sp}$ continues to grow
significantly. This illustrates that halos at low $z$ can have ""quiet""
interiors while continuing to accrete mass in their outskirts. We discuss
potential observational estimates of the splashback radius and show that it may
already have been detected in galaxy clusters.

of typical FastSound H$\alpha$ emitters, which have H$\alpha$ luminosities of
$10^{41.8}$-$10^{43.3}$ erg/s, SFRs of 20--500 $M_\odot$/yr, and stellar masses
of $10^{10.0}$--$10^{11.3}$ $M_\odot$. The 3D distribution maps for the four
fields of CFHTLS W1--4 are presented, clearly showing large scale clustering of
galaxies at the scale of $\sim$ 100--600 comoving Mpc. Based on 1,105 galaxies
with detections of multiple emission lines, we estimate that contamination of
non-H$\alpha$ lines is about 4% in the single-line emission galaxies, which are
mostly [OIII]$\lambda$5007. This contamination fraction is also confirmed by
the stacked spectrum of all the FastSound spectra, in which H$\alpha$,
[NII]$\lambda \lambda$6548,6583, [SII]$\lambda \lambda$6717, 6731, and
[OI]$\lambda \lambda$6300,6364 are seen.

straightforwardly generalizes to multiple U(1)s. We study the flops of such

Furthermore, we carry out a universal study of the U(1)-charged GUT singlets,

detection due to its velocity being similar to gas in the disk. This is
achieved using synthetic observations of the CGM in a simulated MW-mass galaxy
that shows similar CGM kinematics to the MW and external L$\sim$L$_*$ galaxies.
As viewed by a mock observer at a location similar to the Sun, only 50$\%$ (by
mass) of the gas moves at high velocity ($|v_{\rm LSR}|\geq$100 km s$^{-1}$ or
$|v_{\rm DEV}|\geq$50 km s$^{-1}$) in the simulated CGM and would be
observable. The low velocity gas is thermodynamically similar to the high
velocity gas, indicating the 50$\%$ observable fraction is applicable to
spectral lines from the radio to the ultraviolet. We apply the observable mass
fraction (50$\%$) to current estimates of the MW's CGM, and find a corrected
total mass of 2.8$\times$10$^{8} M_{\odot}$ for gas below 10$^6$K within
$\sim15$ kpc (this excludes the Magellanic System). This is less than the total
mass of the CGM extending out to $\sim$150 kpc in other L$\sim$L$_*$ galaxies.
However, we find similar OVI column densities when the discrepancy in path
length between the MW and external galaxies is considered. The coherent spatial
and kinematic distribution of low velocity gas in the simulated CGM suggests
that current HI observations of the MW's CGM may miss large low velocity HI
complexes. In addition, current mass estimates of the MW's CGM based on
high-velocity line observations with distance constraints may miss a
non-negligible fraction of gas in the outer halo which can be obscured if it
moves at a velocity similar to the gas in the lower halo.

between broad-line radio galaxies (BLRG) and steep spectrum radio quasars
(SSRQ). On pc-scales PKS 0521-36 shows a knotty structure similar to misaligned
AGN. The core dominance and the gamma-ray properties are similar to those
estimated for other SSRQ and BLRG detected in gamma rays, suggesting an
intermediate viewing angle with respect to the observer. In this context the
flaring activity detected from this source by Fermi-LAT between 2010 June and
2012 February is very intriguing. We discuss the gamma-ray emission of this
source in the framework of the structured jet scenario, comparing the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of the flaring state in 2010 June with that of a low
state. We present three alternative models corresponding to three different
choices of the viewing angles theta_v = 6, 15, and 20 deg. We obtain a good fit
for the the first two cases, but the SED obtained with theta_v = 15 deg if
observed at a small angle does not resemble that of a typical blazar since the
synchrotron emission should dominate by a large factor (about 100) the inverse
Compton component. This suggests that a viewing angle between 6 and 15 deg is
preferred, with the rapid variability observed during gamma-ray flares
favouring a smaller angle. However, we cannot rule out that PKS 0521-36 is the

lensing maps using the Planck 2013 and 2015 data and the 154 deg^2
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). This measurement
probes large-scale structure at intermediate redshifts ~0.9, between the high-
and low-redshift peaks of the CMB and CFHTLenS lensing kernels, respectively.
Using the noise properties of these data sets and standard Planck 2015 LCDM
cosmological parameters, we forecast a signal-to-noise ratio ~4.6 for the
cross-correlation. We find that the noise level of our actual measurement
agrees well with this estimate, but the amplitude of the signal lies well below
the theoretical prediction. The best-fit amplitudes of our measured
cross-correlations are $A_{2013}=0.48\pm0.26$ and $A_{2015}=0.44\pm0.22$ using
the 2013 and 2015 Planck CMB lensing maps, respectively, where $A=1$
corresponds to the fiducial Planck 2015 LCDM prediction. Due to the low
measured amplitude, the detection significance is moderate (~2$\sigma$) and the
data are in tension with the theoretical prediction (~2-$2.5\sigma$). The
tension is reduced somewhat when compared to predictions using WMAP9
parameters, for which we find $A_{2013}=0.56\pm0.30$ and
$A_{2015}=0.52\pm0.26$. We consider various systematic effects, finding that
photometric redshift uncertainties, contamination by intrinsic alignments, and
effects due to the masking of galaxy clusters in the Planck 2015 CMB lensing
reconstruction are able to help resolve the tension at a significant level
(~10% each). An overall multiplicative bias in the CFHTLenS shear data could
also play a role, which can be tested with existing data. We close with
forecasts for measurements of this cross-correlation using ongoing and future
weak lensing surveys, which will definitively test the significance of the
tension in our results with respect to LCDM.

liquid drop model in the studies of the structure of highly compressed nuclear
matter found in the crust of neutron stars, and, more broadly, is a paradigm
for energy-driven pattern forming systems in which spatial order arises as a
result of the competition of short-range attractive and long-range repulsive
forces. Here we investigate the large volume behavior of minimizers in the low
volume fraction regime, in which one expects the formation of a periodic
lattice of small droplets of the minority phase in a sea of the majority phase.
Under periodic boundary conditions, we prove that the considered energy
$\Gamma$-converges to an energy functional of the limit ""homogenized"" measure
associated with the minority phase consisting of a local linear term and a
non-local quadratic term mediated by the Coulomb kernel. As a consequence,
asymptotically the mass of the minority phase in a minimizer spreads uniformly
across the domain. Similarly, the energy spreads uniformly across the domain as
well, with the limit energy density minimizing the energy of a single droplets
per unit volume. Finally, we prove that in the macroscopic limit the connected
components of the minimizers have volumes and diameters that are bounded above
and below by universal constants, and that most of them converge to the
minimizers of the energy divided by volume for the whole space problem.

the signal along the line-of-sight which is known as the ""light-cone effect"".
We model this effect by post-processing a dark matter $N-$body simulation with
an 1-D radiative transfer code. We find that the effect is much stronger and
dramatic in presence of inhomogeneous heating and Ly$\alpha$ coupling compared
to the case where these processes are not accounted for. One finds increase
(decrease) in the spherically averaged power spectrum up to a factor of 3 (0.6)
at large scales ($k \sim 0.05\, \rm Mpc^{-1}$) when the light-cone effect is
included, though these numbers are highly dependent on the source model. The
effect is particularly significant near the peak and dip-like features seen in
the power spectrum. The peaks and dips are suppressed and thus the power
spectrum can be smoothed out to a large extent if the width of the frequency
band used in the experiment is large. We argue that it is important to account
for the light-cone effect for any 21-cm signal prediction during cosmic dawn.

radii cannot be reproduced by models in which star formation is quenched in
infalling field galaxies only once they pass within r200 of the cluster, but is
consistent with some of them being first pre-processed within galaxy groups.
Despite the increasing f_SF-radius trend, the surface density of star-forming
galaxies actually declines steadily with radius, falling ~15x from the core to
2r200. This requires star-formation to survive within recently accreted spirals
for 2--3Gyr to build up the apparent over-density of star-forming galaxies
within clusters. The velocity dispersion profile of the star-forming galaxy
population shows a sharp peak of 1.44-sigma_v at 0.3r500, and is 10--35% higher

infalling population, but one that must also survive ~0.5--2Gyr beyond passing

between the useful signal and the interference. Furthermore, we demonstrate an

groups according to the techniques involved: proofs that rely on real or
complex analysis, algebraic proofs, and topological proofs. Algebraic proofs
make use of the fact that odd-degree real polynomials have real roots. This
assumption, however, requires analytic methods, namely, the intermediate value
theorem for real continuous functions. In this paper, we develop the idea of
algebraic proof further towards a purely algebraic proof of the intermediate
value theorem for real polynomials. In our proof, we neither use the notion of
continuous function nor refer to any theorem of real and complex analysis.
Instead, we apply techniques of modern algebra: we extend the field of real
numbers to the non-Archimedean field of hyperreals via an ultraproduct
construction and explore some relationships between the subring of limited
hyperreals, its maximal ideal of infinitesimals, and real numbers.

of 84 tomato accessions and related wild species representative for the
Lycopersicon, Arcanum, Eriopersicon, and Neolycopersicon groups. We present a
reconstruction of three new reference genomes in support of our comparative
genome analyses. Sequence diversity in commercial breeding lines appears
extremely low, indicating the dramatic genetic erosion of crop tomatoes. This
is reflected by the SNP count in wild species which can exceed 10 million i.e.
20 fold higher than in crop accessions. Comparative sequence alignment reveals
group, species, and accession specific polymorphisms, which explain
characteristic fruit traits and growth habits in tomato accessions. Using gene
models from the annotated Heinz reference genome, we observe a bias in dN/dS
ratio in fruit and growth diversification genes compared to a random set of
genes, which probably is the result of a positive selection. We detected highly
divergent segments in wild S. lycopersicum species, and footprints of
introgressions in crop accessions originating from a common donor accession.
Phylogenetic relationships of fruit diversification and growth specific genes
from crop accessions show incomplete resolution and are dependent on the
introgression donor. In contrast, whole genome SNP information has sufficient
power to resolve the phylogenetic placement of each accession in the four main
groups in the Lycopersicon clade using Maximum Likelihood analyses.
Phylogenetic relationships appear correlated with habitat and mating type and
point to the occurrence of geographical races within these groups and thus are
of practical importance for introgressive hybridization breeding. Our study
illustrates the need for multiple reference genomes in support of tomato
comparative genomics and Solanum genome evolution studies.

caused by circularly symmetric impurity gradients in the silicon of the
sensors. They effectively modify the pixel area and shift the photogenerated
charge around, displacing the observed photon positions. The displacement
distribution generates distortions that cause spurious shears correlated with
the tree-rings patterns, potentially biasing cosmic shear measurements. In this
paper we quantify the amplitude of the spurious shear caused by the tree rings
on the LSST candidate sensors, and calculate its 2-point correlation function.
We find that 2-point correlation function of the spurious shear on an area
equivalent to the LSST field of view is order of about $10^{-13}$, providing a
negligible contribution to the 2-point correlation of the cosmic shear signal.

a noteworthy group of researchers has used some notions of oppositeness to

evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement agents, and neural networks have been
reportedly extended into their opposition-based version to become faster and/or
more accurate. However, most works still use a simple notion of opposites,
namely linear (or type- I) opposition, that for each $x\in[a,b]$ assigns its
opposite as $\breve{x}_I=a+b-x$. This, of course, is a very naive estimate of
the actual or true (non-linear) opposite $\breve{x}_{II}$, which has been
called type-II opposite in literature. In absence of any knowledge about a
function $y=f(\mathbf{x})$ that we need to approximate, there seems to be no
alternative to the naivety of type-I opposition if one intents to utilize
oppositional concepts. But the question is if we can receive some level of
accuracy increase and time savings by using the naive opposite estimate
$\breve{x}_I$ according to all reports in literature, what would we be able to
gain, in terms of even higher accuracies and more reduction in computational
complexity, if we would generate and employ true opposites? This work
introduces an approach to approximate type-II opposites using evolving fuzzy
rules when we first perform opposition mining. We show with multiple examples
that learning true opposites is possible when we mine the opposites from the
training data to subsequently approximate $\breve{x}_{II}=f(\mathbf{x},y)$.

a strong dependence of the integral SHG intensity on the film thickness. The
integral SHG intensity was determined by area integration of the SHG rotational
anisotropy patterns measured for different input-output light polarization
geometries. A ~100-fold enhancement of the integral SHG intensity with
decreasing film thickness has been suggested to result from the
DC-electric-field-induced SHG (EFISHG) effects. Two sources of dynamically
created DC electric field were proposed: (i) the capacitor-type DC electric
field that gradually increases with decreasing film thickness from 40 to 6 nm
due to a dynamical imbalance of photoexcited long-lived carriers between the
opposite-surface Dirac surface states and (ii) an DC electric field associated
with a nonlinearly excited Dirac plasmon, which is responsible for the resonant
enhancement of the integral SHG intensity for the 10 nm thick film with a
Lorentz-shaped resonance of ~1.6 nm full width at half maximum. Additionally to
the general SHG enhancement trends with decreasing film thickness, a relative
decrease of the out-of-plane contribution with respect to the in-plane
contribution was observed. Using a theoretical treatment of the measured SHG
rotational anisotropy patterns, this effect has been suggested to result from
the joint contributions of the linear and quadratic DC electric field effects

parameterization algorithm that is able to fit a closed curve to a set of

vision applications where misclassification of features may lead to outliers.
The algorithm starts by fitting ellipses to numerous five point subsets from
the source data. The closed curve is parameterized by determining the median
perimeter of the set of ellipses. The resulting curve is not an ellipse,
allowing arbitrary closed contours to be parameterized. The use of the modal
perimeter rather than the median perimeter is also explored. A detailed
comparison is made between the proposed curve fitting algorithm and existing
robust ellipse fitting algorithms. Finally, the utility of the algorithm for
computer vision applications is demonstrated through the parameterization of
the boundary of fuel droplets during combustion. The performance of the
proposed algorithm and the performance of existing algorithms are compared to a
ground truth segmentation of the fuel droplet images, which demonstrates
improved performance for both area quantification and edge deviation.

proposed that this can be carried out via the precisely measuring the cross
section of ZH associated production up to $0.4\%$. In this paper, we example
the possible heavy pollution from Higgs-top anomalous coupling. Our numerical
results show that the pollution is small for $\sqrt{s}_{e^+e^-}= 240 GeV$.
However for the higher energy collider, pollution is sizable, which should be
taken into account. We further explored the possibility to measure CP-violated
Higgs top coupling, via the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ for the process
$e^+e^- \rightarrow ZH$. The asymmetry can reach $0.7\%$ which is comparable to
the precision of cross section measurement.

show that the first-order symmetric SSPP mode has zero transmission in the MBG

exposed some votes to complete compromise of privacy and integrity. At least
one parliamentary seat was decided by a margin much smaller than the number of

including vote verification that was itself susceptible to manipulation. This

important as smartphones have recently replaced the role of traditional
computers. Smartphones are subject to traditional computer network covert
channel techniques. Smartphones also introduce new sets of covert channel
techniques as they add more capabilities and multiple network connections. This
work presents a new network covert channel in smartphones. The research studies
the ability to leak information from the smartphones applications by reaching
the cellular voice stream, and it examines the ability to employ the cellular
voice channel to be a potential medium of information leakage through carrying
modulated speech-like data covertly. To validate the theory, an Android
software audio modem has been developed and it was able to leak data
successfully through the cellular voice channel stream by carrying modulated
data with a throughput of 13 bps with 0.018% BER. Moreover, Android security
policies are investigated and broken in order to implement a user-mode rootkit
that opens the voice channels by stealthily answering an incoming voice call.
Multiple scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
covert channel. This study identifies a new potential smartphone covert
channel, and discusses some security vulnerabilities in Android OS that allow
the use of this channel demonstrating the need to set countermeasures against
this kind of breach.

only with $\Omega(n^{\beta})$ query complexity (for constant $\beta > 0$), and
there were several, quite different, constructions known.
  Our codes are based on a general distance-amplification method of Alon and

correctors and testers, and obtain our main results by applying it to suitably

  Along the way, we also construct LCCs and LTCs over large alphabets, with the
same query complexity $\exp(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log n}))$, which additionally have
the property of approaching the Singleton bound: they have almost the
best-possible relationship between their rate and distance. This has the
surprising consequence that asking for a large alphabet error-correcting code
to further be an LCC or LTC with $\exp(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log n}))$ query
complexity does not require any sacrifice in terms of rate and distance! Such a

improved by increasing $M$ and $K$ (i.e. massive MIMO regime). For example, for
a fixed $K$ and a fixed training length, the required per-user radiated power
during uplink training decreases as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}$ with increasing $M$.

functions, and is computationally efficient for spatial prediction via fixed
rank kriging. However, the success of this model depends on an appropriate set
of basis functions. In this research, we propose a class of basis functions
extracted from thin-plate splines. These functions are ordered in terms of
their degrees of smoothness with a higher-order function corresponding to
larger-scale features and a lower-order one corresponding to smaller-scale
details, leading to a parsimonious representation for a nonstationary spatial
covariance function. Consequently, only a small to moderate number of functions
are needed in a spatial random-effects model. The proposed class of basis
functions has several advantages over commonly used ones. First, we do not need
to concern about the allocation of the basis functions, but simply select the
total number of functions corresponding to a resolution. Second, only a small
number of basis functions is usually required, which facilitates computation.
Third, estimation variability of model parameters can be considerably reduced,
and hence more precise covariance function estimates can be obtained. Fourth,
the proposed basis functions depend only on the data locations but not the
measurements taken at those locations, and are applicable regardless of whether
the data locations are sparse or irregularly spaced. In addition, we derive a
simple close-form expression for the maximum likelihood estimates of model

even in small networks, the corresponding constrained stochastic control
problems with continuous spaces suffer from curses of dimensionality, and are
intractable in general settings. For large networks, no efficient algorithm is
known to give optimal or near-optimal performance. This paper provides an

generalized storage is a unifying dynamic model for many components of the grid

The BSs cooperatively transmit contents, which are either stored in the local

challenges in physics and physical chemistry, due to the prohibitively large
computational resources that would be required by using classical computers. A
solution has been foreseen by directly simulating the time evolution through
sequences of quantum gates applied to arrays of qubits, i.e. by implementing a
digital quantum simulator. Superconducting circuits and resonators are emerging
as an extremely-promising platform for quantum computation architectures, but a
digital quantum simulator proposal that is straightforwardly scalable,
universal, and realizable with state-of-the-art technology is presently
lacking. Here we propose a viable scheme to implement a universal quantum
simulator with hybrid spin-photon qubits in an array of superconducting
resonators, which is intrinsically scalable and allows for local control. As
representative examples we consider the transverse-field Ising model, a spin-1
Hamiltonian, and the two-dimensional Hubbard model; for these, we numerically
simulate the scheme by including the main sources of decoherence. In addition,
we show how to circumvent the potentially harmful effects of inhomogeneous
broadening of the spin systems.

(SoU) is a well-studied problem. There are, however, a number of problems of
theoretical and practical interest where a designer may have a different
objective than maximization of the SoU. One motivation for this is the desire
for more equitable allocation of resources among agents. A second, more subtle,
motivation is the fact that a fairer allocation indirectly implies less
variation in taxes which can be desirable in a situation where (implicit)
individual agent budgetary constraints make payment of large taxes unrealistic.
In this paper we study a family of social utilities that provide fair
allocation (with SoU being subsumed as an extreme case) and derive conditions
under which Bayesian and Dominant strategy implementation is possible.
Furthermore, it is shown how a simple modification of the above mechanism can
guarantee full Bayesian implementation. Through a numerical example it is shown
that the proposed method can result in significant gains both in allocation
fairness and tax reduction.

noise are included in our model. We then generate realistic mock weak lensing
catalogs to test the accuracy of our analytic model. To this end, we perform
full-sky ray-tracing simulations that allow us to have multiple realizations of
a large continuous area. We model the masked regions on the sky using the
actual positions of bright stars, and generate 200 mock weak lensing catalogs
with sky coverage of ~1000 squared degrees. We show that our theoretical model
agrees well with the ensemble average of statistics and their covariances
calculated directly from the mock catalogues. With a typical selection
threshold, ignoring shape noise correction causes overestimation of the
clustering of weak lensing selected clusters with a level of about 10%, and
shape noise correction boosts the cluster abundance by a factor of a few. We
calculate the cross-covariances using the halo model with accounting for the
effective reduction of the survey area due to masks. The covariance of the
cosmic shear auto power spectrum is affected by the mode-coupling effect that
originates from sky masking. Our model and the results can be readily used for

more opportunities for quantum phase control. Our result also indicates the

such as relay terminals in their vicinities, this shared resource may not be
always available for every user, and it is critical for transmitting terminals
to know whether other users have access to that common resource in order to
better utilize it. Failing to learn this critical piece of information may
cause severe issues in the design of such cooperative systems. In this paper,
we address this problem by investigating a two-pair two-way relay channel with
an intermittently available relay. In the model, each pair of users need to
exchange their messages within their own pair via the shared relay. The shared
relay, however, is only intermittently available for the users to access. The
accessing activities of different pairs of users are governed by independent
Bernoulli random processes. Our main contribution is the characterization of
the capacity region to within a bounded gap in a symmetric setting, for both
delayed and instantaneous state information at transmitters. An interesting
observation is that the bottleneck for information flow is the quality of state
information (delayed or instantaneous) available at the relay, not those at the
end users. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first result regarding
how the shared intermittent relay should cooperate with multiple pairs of users
in such a two-way cooperative network.

meson in terms of derivative operator over the extra bulk coordinate. The
effective mass found in this way coincides with the one obtained from finding
of poles of the two-point correlation function. In order to avoid introducing
distinguished infrared boundaries in the quantisation formula for the different
mesons from the same isotriplet we introduce extra action terms at this
boundary, which reduces distinguished values of this boundary to the same
value. Profile function solutions and effective mass expressions were found for
the in-medium $\rho$, $a_1$ and $\pi$ mesons.

approach incorporating both hadronic and partonic phases -- the
Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD). In the present work, four extensions are
introduced compared to our previous calculations: (i) going beyond the
soft-photon approximation (SPA) in the calculation of the bremsstrahlung
processes $meson+meson\to meson+meson+\gamma$, (ii) quantifying the suppression
due to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) coherence effect, (iii) adding the
additional channels $V+N\to N+\gamma$ and $\Delta\to N+\gamma$ and (iv)
providing predictions for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. The
first issue extends the applicability of the bremsstrahlung calculations to
higher photon energies in order to understand the relevant sources in the
region $p_T=0.5-1.5$ GeV, while the LPM correction turns out to be important
for $p_T<0.4$ GeV in the partonic phase. The results suggest that a large
elliptic flow $v_2$ of the direct photons signals a significant contribution of
photons produced in interactions of secondary mesons and baryons in the late
(hadronic) stage of the heavy-ion collision. In order to further differentiate
the origin of the direct photon azimuthal asymmetry (late hadron interactions
vs electromagnetic fields in the initial stage), we provide predictions for the
triangular flow $v_3(p_T)$ of direct photons. Additionally, we illustrate the
magnitude of the photon production in the partonic and hadronic phases as
functions of time and local energy density. Finally, the 'cocktail' method for
an estimation of the background photon elliptic flow, which is widely used in
the experimental works, is supported by the calculations within the PHSD
transport approach.

are expected in and above the post-flare loops. To understand the dynamics of
post-flare loops, a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (2D MHD) simulation of
a solar flare has been carried out. We found new shock structures in and above
the post-flare loops, which were not resolved in the previous work by Yokoyama
and Shibata 2001. To study the dynamics of flows along the reconnected magnetic
field, kinematics and energetics of the plasma are investigated along selected
field lines. It is found that shocks are crucial to determine the thermal and
flow structures in the post-flare loops. On the basis of the 2D MHD simulation,
we have developed a new post-flare loop model which we call the pseudo-2D MHD
model. The model is based on the 1D MHD equations, where all the variables
depend on one space dimension and all the three components of the magnetic and
velocity fields are considered. Our pseudo-2D model includes many features of
the multi-dimensional MHD processes related to magnetic reconnection
(particularly MHD shocks), which the previous 1D hydrodynamic models are not
able to include. We compare the shock formation and energetics of a specific
field line in the 2D calculation with those in our pseudo-2D MHD model, and we
found that they give similar results. This model will allow us to study the
evolution of the post-flare loops in a wide parameter space without expensive
computational cost and without neglecting important physics associated with
magnetic reconnection.

study the parameter space of the initial conditions to quantify the mass loss
from the debris disk and its lifetime under the influence of the planet. We
find that when the planet orbits closer to the star than about 50 AU and with
low inclination relative to the disk (less than about 10 degrees), more disk
material is perturbed outside than inside the region constrained by
observations on timescales shorter than 1 Myr. Considering the age of the
system, such a short lifetime of the disk is incompatible with the timescale
for planet--planet scattering which is one of the scenarios suggested to
explain the wide separation of the planet. For some configurations when the
planet's orbit is inclined with respect to the disk, the latter will start to
wobble. We argue that this wobbling is caused by a mechanism similar to the
Kozai--Lidov oscillations. We also observe various resonant structures (such as

convex quadratic problems arising in many engineering applications. When it is
difficult to project on the primal feasible set, we use the (augmented)
Lagrangian relaxation to handle the complicated constraints and then, we apply
dual first order algorithms based on inexact dual gradient information for
solving the corresponding dual problem. The iteration complexity analysis is
based on two types of approximate primal solutions: the primal last iterate and
an average of primal iterates. We provide computational complexity estimates on
the primal suboptimality and feasibility violation of the generated approximate
primal solutions. Then, these algorithms are implemented in the programming
language C in DuQuad, and optimized for low iteration complexity and low memory
footprint. DuQuad has a dynamic Matlab interface which make the process of
testing, comparing, and analyzing the algorithms simple. The algorithms are
implemented using only basic arithmetic and logical operations and are suitable
to run on low cost hardware. It is shown that if an approximate solution is
sufficient for a given application, there exists problems where some of the
implemented algorithms obtain the solution faster than state-of-the-art
commercial solvers.

Extremely reddened AGB stars lose mass at high rates of >10^-5
Msun/yr. This is the very last stage of AGB evolution, in which stars in the
mass range 2.0--4.0 Msun (for solar metallicity) should have been converted to
C stars already. The extremely reddened AGB stars in the Galactic bulge are
however predominantly O-rich, implying that they might be either low-mass stars
or stars at the upper end of the AGB mass range. Aims. To determine the mass
range of the most reddened AGB stars in the Galactic bulge. Methods. Using
Virtual Observatory tools, we constructed spectral energy distributions of a
sample of 37 evolved stars in the Galactic bulge with extremely red IRAS
colours. We fitted DUSTY models to the observational data to infer the
bolometric fluxes. Applying individual corrections for interstellar extinction
and adopting a common distance, we determined luminosities and mass-loss rates,
and inferred the progenitor mass range from comparisons with AGB evolutionary
models. Results. The observed spectral energy distributions are consistent with
a classification as reddened AGB stars, except for two stars, which are
proto-planetary nebula candidates. For the AGB stars, we found luminosities in
the range 3000--30,000 Lsun and mass-loss rates 10^-5--3x10^-4 Msun/yr. The
corresponding mass range is 1.1--6.0 Msun assuming solar metallicity.
Conclusions. Contrary to the predictions of the evolutionary models, the
luminosity distribution is continuous, with many O-rich AGB stars in the mass
range in which they should have been converted into C stars already. We suspect
that bulge AGB stars have higher than solar metallicity and therefore may avoid
the conversion to C-rich. The presence of low-mass stars in the sample shows
that their termination of the AGB evolution also occurs during a final phase of
very high mass-loss rate, leading to optically thick circumstellar shells.

this work, we focus on how basin stability depends on the coupling strength
between nodes. We use the Chilean power grid as a case study. In general, basin
stability goes from zero to one as coupling strength increases. However, this
transition does not happen at the same value for different nodes. By
understanding the transition for individual nodes, we can further characterize
their role in the power-transmission dynamics. We find that nodes with an
exceptionally large transition window also have a low community consistency. In
other words, they are hard to classify to one community when applying a
community detection algorithm. This also gives an efficient way to identify
nodes with a long transition window (which is computationally time consuming).
Finally, to corroborate these results, we present a stylized example network

elements of network theory, we constructed an agent-based model that obeys the

economic environment confounded with adverse selection, a form of latent moral
hazard may cause a regime shift from a high to a low loan repayment
probability. An after-the-fact recovery, when possible, required the economic
environment to improve beyond that which led to the shift in the first place.
These findings suggest a small set of measurable quantities for mapping
microfinance credit risk and, consequently, for balancing the requirements to
reasonably price loans and to operate on a fully self-financed basis. We
illustrate how the proposed mapping works using a 10-year monthly data set from
one of the best-known microfinance representatives, Grameen Bank in Bangladesh.
Finally, we discuss an entirely new perspective for managing microfinance
credit risk based on enticing spontaneous cooperation by building social

along the genome has proved to be an effective strategy to identify possible
causes of transcriptional deregulation in cancer. It has been successfully used
to illustrate the role of mechanisms such as copy number variation (CNV) or
epigenetic alterations as factors that may significantly alter expression in
large chromosomic regions (gene silencing or gene activation).
  Results: The identification of correlated regions requires segmenting the
gene expression correlation matrix into regions of homogeneously correlated
genes and assessing whether the observed local correlation is significantly
higher than the background chromosomal correlation. A unified statistical
framework is proposed to achieve these two tasks, where optimal segmentation is
efficiently performed using dynamic programming algorithm, and detection of
highly correlated regions is then achieved using an exact test procedure. We
also propose a simple and efficient procedure to correct the expression signal
for mechanisms already known to impact expression correlation. The performance
and robustness of the proposed procedure, called SegCorr, are evaluated on
simulated data. The procedure is illustrated on cancer data, where the signal
is corrected for correlations possibly caused by copy number variation. The
correction permitted the detection of regions with high correlations linked to
DNA methylation.
  Availability and implementation: R package SegCorr is available on the CRAN.

first erasing the block that contains them. The lifetime of the flash is a
function of the number of block erasures and can be as small as several
thousands. To reduce the number of block erasures, pages, which are the
smallest write unit, are rewritten out-of-place in the memory. A Write-once
memory (WOM) code is a coding scheme which enables to write multiple times to
the block before an erasure. However, these codes come with significant rate
loss. For example, the rate for writing twice (with the same rate) is at most
0.77.
  In this paper, we study WOM codes and their tradeoff between rate loss and
reduction in the number of block erasures, when pages are written uniformly at
random. First, we introduce a new measure, called erasure factor, that reflects
both the number of block erasures and the amount of data that can be written on
each block. A key point in our analysis is that this tradeoff depends upon the
specific implementation of WOM codes in the memory. We consider two systems
that use WOM codes; a conventional scheme that was commonly used, and a new
recent design that preserves the overall storage capacity. While the first
system can improve the erasure factor only when the storage rate is at most
0.6442, we show that the second scheme always improves this figure of merit.

of pandemic spread. Macro-level descriptors of the topology of the World
Airline Network (WAN) explains middle and late stage dynamics of pandemic
spread mediated by this network, but necessarily regard early stage variation
as stochastic. We propose that much of early stage variation can be explained
by appropriately characterizing the local topology surrounding the debut
location of an outbreak. We measure for each airport the expected force of
infection (AEF) which a pandemic originating at that airport would generate. We
observe, for a subset of world airports, the minimum transmission rate at which
a disease becomes pandemically competent at each airport. We also observe, for
a larger subset, the time until a pandemically competent outbreak achieves
pandemic status given its debut location. Observations are generated using a
highly sophisticated metapopulation reaction-diffusion simulator under a
disease model known to well replicate the 2009 influenza pandemic. The
robustness of the AEF measure to model misspecification is examined by
degrading the network model. AEF powerfully explains pandemic risk, showing
correlation of 0.90 to the transmission level needed to give a disease pandemic
competence, and correlation of 0.85 to the delay until an outbreak becomes a
pandemic. The AEF is robust to model misspecification. For 97% of airports,
removing 15% of airports from the model changes their AEF metric by less than
1%. Appropriately summarizing the size, shape, and diversity of an airport's
local neighborhood in the WAN accurately explains much of the macro-level
stochasticity in pandemic outcomes.

describe a new phase-occulting (PO) interferometric nulling coronagraphy (NC)
approach. The PO-NC approach employs beamwalk and freeform optical surfaces
internal to the interferometer cavity to introduce a radially dependent plate
scale difference between each interferometer arm (optical path) that nulls the
central star at high contrast while transmitting the off-axis field. The design
is readily implemented on segmented-mirror telescope architectures, utilizing a
single nulling interferometer to achieve high throughput, a small inner working
angle (IWA), sixth-order or higher starlight suppression, and full off-axis
discovery space, a combination of features that other coronagraph designs
generally must trade. Unlike previous NC approaches, the PO-NC approach does
not require pupil shearing; this increases throughput and renders it less
sensitive to on-axis common-mode telescope errors, permitting relief of the
observatory stability required to achieve contrast levels of $\leq10^{-10}$.
Observatory operations are also simplified by removing the need for multiple
telescope rolls and shears to construct a high contrast image. The design goals
for a PO nuller are similar to other coronagraphs intended for direct detection
of habitable zone (HZ) exoEarth signal: contrasts on the order of $10^{-10}$ at
an IWA of $\leq3\lambda/D$ over $\geq10$% bandpass with a large ($>10$~m)

the large time scale spin relaxation is non-exponential. We argue that the
non-exponential relaxation of the magnetic moment is related to the spin of
electrons in the slow-relaxing traps. Interestingly the traps can significantly

underlie rapport, empathy and even team performance. Inspired by the model of
interpersonal synergy, we critically investigate the presence, temporal
development, possible mechanisms and impact of shared interpersonal heart rate
dynamics during individual and collective creative LEGO construction tasks. In
Study 1 we show how shared HR dynamics are driven by a plurality of sources
including task constraints and behavioral coordination. Generally, shared HR
dynamics are more prevalent in individual trials (involving participants doing
the same things) than in collective ones (involving participants taking turns
and performing complementary actions). However, when contrasted against virtual
pairs, collective trials display more stable shared HR dynamics suggesting that
online social interaction plays an important role. Furthermore, in contrast to
individual trials, shared HR dynamics are found to increase across collective
trials. Study 2 investigates which aspects of social interaction might drive
these effects. We show that shared HR dynamics are statistically predicted by
interpersonal speech and building coordination. In Study 3, we explore the
relation between HR dynamics, behavioral coordination, and self-reported
measures of rapport and group competence. While behavioral coordination
predicts rapport and group competence, shared HR dynamics do not. Although
shared physiological dynamics were reliably observed in our study, our results
warrant not to consider HR dynamics a general driving mechanism of social
coordination. Behavioral coordination - on the other hand - seems to be more
informative of both shared physiological dynamics and collective experience.

to accurately describe a physical system of interest. In such cases, Monte
Carlo algorithms are remarkably flexible and extremely powerful approaches to
solve such inference problems. However, in the presence of a high-dimensional
and/or multimodal posterior distribution, it is widely documented that standard
Monte-Carlo techniques could lead to poor performance. In this paper, the study
is focused on a Sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) sampler framework, a more robust
and efficient Monte Carlo algorithm. Although this approach presents many
advantages over traditional Monte-Carlo methods, the potential of this emergent
technique is however largely underexploited in signal processing. In this work,
we aim at proposing some novel strategies that will improve the efficiency and
facilitate practical implementation of the SMC sampler specifically for signal
processing applications. Firstly, we propose an automatic and adaptive strategy
that selects the sequence of distributions within the SMC sampler that
minimizes the asymptotic variance of the estimator of the posterior
normalization constant. This is critical for performing model selection in
modelling applications in Bayesian signal processing. The second original
contribution we present improves the global efficiency of the SMC sampler by
introducing a novel correction mechanism that allows the use of the particles
generated through all the iterations of the algorithm (instead of only
particles from the last iteration). This is a significant contribution as it
removes the need to discard a large portion of the samples obtained, as is
standard in standard SMC methods. This will improve estimation performance in
practical settings where computational budget is important to consider.

humans and automated systems, because haptics facilitate mutual communication.
A methodology for sharing a given task is important to achieve effective shared
control. Therefore, the appropriate cooperative relationship between a human
operator and automated system should be considered. This paper proposes a
methodology to evaluate the cooperative status between the operator and the
automated system in the haptic shared control of a steering operation using a
pseudo-power pair of torque from each agent and the vehicle lateral velocity as
each agent's contribution to vehicle motion. This method allows us to estimate
cooperative status based on two axes: the initiative holder and the intent
consistency between the two agents. A control method for a lane-keeping assist
system (LKAS) that enables drivers to change lanes smoothly is proposed based
on the estimated cooperative status. A gain-tuning control method based on the
estimated cooperative status is proposed to decrease the assistance system's

that these methods perform well as long as a suitable, problem-dependent
parameter is chosen. This parameter is used in a threshold which decides
whether or not to detect an element as a troubled cell. Until now, these
parameters could not be chosen automatically. The choice of the parameter has
impact on the approximation: it determines the strictness of the troubled-cell
indicator. An inappropriate choice of the parameter will result in detection
(and limiting) of too few or too many elements. The optimal parameter is chosen
such that the minimal number of troubled cells is detected and the resulting
approximation is free of spurious oscillations. In this paper we will see that
for each troubled-cell indicator the sudden increase or decrease of the
indicator value with respect to the neighboring values is important for
detection. Indication basically reduces to detecting the outliers of a vector
(one dimension) or matrix (two dimensions). This is done using Tukey's boxplot
approach to detect which coefficients in a vector are straying far beyond
others (Tukey, 1977). We provide an algorithm that can be applied to various
troubled-cell indication variables. Using this technique the problem-dependent

"1504.05800","Uri Stemmer","Kobbi Nissim, Uri Stemmer","On the Generalization Properties of Differential Privacy","This paper was merged with another manuscript and is now subsumed by
  arXiv:1511.02513",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new line of work, started with Dwork et al., studies the task of answering
statistical queries using a sample and relates the problem to the concept of
differential privacy. By the Hoeffding bound, a sample of size $O(\log
k/\alpha^2)$ suffices to answer $k$ non-adaptive queries within error $\alpha$,
where the answers are computed by evaluating the statistical queries on the
sample. This argument fails when the queries are chosen adaptively (and can
hence depend on the sample). Dwork et al. showed that if the answers are
computed with $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy then $O(\epsilon)$
accuracy is guaranteed with probability $1-O(\delta^\epsilon)$. Using the
Private Multiplicative Weights mechanism, they concluded that the sample size
can still grow polylogarithmically with the $k$.
  Very recently, Bassily et al. presented an improved bound and showed that (a
variant of) the private multiplicative weights algorithm can answer $k$
adaptively chosen statistical queries using sample complexity that grows
logarithmically in $k$. However, their results no longer hold for every
differentially private algorithm, and require modifying the private
multiplicative weights algorithm in order to obtain their high probability
bounds.
  We greatly simplify the results of Dwork et al. and improve on the bound by
showing that differential privacy guarantees $O(\epsilon)$ accuracy with
probability $1-O(\delta\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon)$. It would be tempting to
guess that an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private computation should
guarantee $O(\epsilon)$ accuracy with probability $1-O(\delta)$. However, we
show that this is not the case, and that our bound is tight (up to logarithmic
factors).

the initial state is the tensor product of $n$ copies of a tripartite state
$\rho^{ABC}$, and is transformed to a quantum Markov chain conditioned by $B^n$
with a small error, using a random unitary operation on $A^n$. In an asymptotic
limit of infinite copies and vanishingly small error, we analyze the
Markovianizing cost, that is, the minimum cost of randomness per copy required
for Markovianization. For tripartite pure states, we derive a single-letter
formula for the Markovianizing costs. Counterintuitively, the Markovianizing
cost is not a continuous function of states, and can be arbitrarily large even
if the state is close to a quantum Markov chain. Our results have an
application in analyzing the cost of resources for simulating a bipartite
unitary gate by local operations and classical communication.

of 99 L_K_sun/(pc**2) with an uncertainty of approximately 10 %. This
corresponds to a mass-to-light ratio for the solar cylinder of M/L_K = 0.34

larger than the local value despite the fact that the local population has a
much larger contribution of young stars. It turns out that the effective scale

of the giants, which are dominating the NIR light. The corresponding colour for
the solar cylinder is V-K=2.89 mag compared to the local value of V-K = 2.46

coupling limit of Yang-Mills theory can be understood in terms of the dynamics
of a higher-rank abelian gauge field, namely, the 3-form dual to the
Chern-Simons topological current. Building on this result, we show that the
field theoretical interpretation of the Chern-Simons term, as opposed to its
topological interpretation, also leads to the analytic form of the confinement
potential that arises in the large distance limit of $QCD$. In fact, for a
$(3+1)$-dimensional generalization of the Schwinger model, we explicitly
compute the interaction energy. This generalization is due to the presence of
the topological gauge field $A_{\mu\nu\rho}$. Our results show that the static
potential profile contains a linear term leading to the confinement of static

different cross sections on solar nuclei as well as the case where the capture

dark matter. Since the captured number of particles are competitive with
asymmetric dark matter models in a large range of parameter space, one may
expect solar physics to be altered by the capture of Dirac dark matter. It is

next-generation experiments of the neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu 2\beta$)
decay. The effective mass term of this process, $\langle m\rangle^{}_{ee}$, may
be contaminated by new physics. So how to interpret a discovery or null result
of the $0\nu 2\beta$ decay in the foreseeable future is highly nontrivial. In
this paper we introduce a novel three-dimensional description of $|\langle
m\rangle_{ee}^{}|$, which allows us to see its sensitivity to the lightest
neutrino mass and two Majorana phases in a transparent way. We take a look at
to what extent the free parameters of $|\langle m\rangle_{ee}^{}|$ can be well
constrained provided a signal of the $0\nu 2\beta$ decay is observed someday.
To fully explore lepton number violation, all the six effective Majorana mass
terms $\langle m\rangle_{\alpha\beta}^{}$ (for $\alpha, \beta = e, \mu, \tau$)
are calculated and their lower bounds are illustrated with the two-dimensional
contour figures. The effect of possible new physics on the $0\nu 2\beta$ decay
is also discussed in a model-independent way. We find that the result of
$|\langle m\rangle_{ee}^{}|$ in the normal (or inverted) neutrino mass ordering
case modified by the new physics effect may somewhat mimic that in the inverted
(or normal) mass ordering case in the standard three-flavor scheme. Hence a
proper interpretation of a discovery or null result of the $0\nu 2\beta$ decay
may demand extra information from some other measurements.

Within the BCS theory this is understood to result from the fact that the
pairing of electrons takes place only close to the usually two-dimensional
Fermi surface residing at a finite chemical potential. Because of this, the
critical temperature is exponentially suppressed compared to the microscopic
energy scales. On the other hand, pairing electrons around a dispersionless
(flat) energy band leads to very strong superconductivity, with a mean-field
critical temperature linearly proportional to the microscopic coupling
constant. The prize to be paid is that flat bands can generally be generated
only on surfaces and interfaces, where high-temperature superconductivity would
show up. The flat-band character and the low dimensionality also mean that
despite the high critical temperature such a superconducting state would be
subject to strong fluctuations. Here we discuss the topological and
non-topological flat bands discussed in different systems, and show that
graphite is a good candidate for showing high-temperature flat-band interface
superconductivity.

either different acceleration processes for protons and electrons or as the
presence of a proton population accelerated during the impulsive phase of the

particle measurements by GOES and STEREO (High Energy Telescope, HET) shows
that five of these {\gamma}-events were not accompanied by SEP events at 1 AU,

through the mechanism of triadic closure. Using the Journal Citation Reports
2011, 2012, and 2013, we analyze triad formation as indicators of integration
(specialty growth) and disintegration (restructuring). The strongest
integration is found among the large journals that report on studies in
different scientific specialties, such as PLoS ONE, Nature Communications,
Nature, and Science. This tendency towards large-scale integration has not yet
stabilized. Using the Islands algorithm, we also distinguish 51 local maxima of
integration. We zoom into the cited articles that carry the integration for:
(i) a new development within high-energy physics and (ii) an emerging interface
between the journals Applied Mathematical Modeling and the International
Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology. In the first case, integration is
brought about by a specific communication reaching across specialty boundaries,
whereas in the second, the dyad of journals indicates an emerging interface
between specialties. These results suggest that integration picks up
substantive developments at the specialty level. An advantage of the bottom-up
method is that no ex ante classification of journals is assumed in the dynamic
analysis.

electrodynamics (matter) and gravity sectors, characterise the features of our
analytical solutions. Black holes or naked singularities are found to arise,
depending on the values of $b^2$ and $\kappa$, as well as charge and mass.
Several such solutions are classified and understood through the analysis of
the associated metric functions for fixed $\kappa$, varying $b^2$ and
vice-versa. Further, we also compare the new metric functions with those for
the known $b^2\rightarrow \infty$ (Maxwell) and the $\kappa \rightarrow 0$
(geonic black hole) cases. Interestingly, for a particular relation between
these two parameters, $b^2=1/{4\kappa},\, \kappa >0$, we obtain a solution
resembling the well-known Reissner-Nordstr\"" om line element, albeit some
modifications. Using this particular solution as the background spacetime, we
study null geodesics for Born-Infeld photons and also, gravitational lensing.
Among interesting features we note $(i)$ an increase in the radius of the
photon sphere with increasing $\kappa$ and $(ii)$ a net positive contribution
in the leading order correction term involving $\kappa$, in the weak lensing
formula for the deflection angle. We also investigate the effective potential
and light propagation for various other solutions through numerics and plots.
In summary, our work is the first attempt towards figuring out how Born-Infeld
structures in both the matter and gravity sectors can influence the nature and
character of resulting gravitational fields.

we transform the multi-label recognition problem into a multi-class
multi-instance learning problem. Then, in addition to extracting the typical
CNN feature representation from each proposal, we propose to make use of
ground-truth bounding box annotations (strong labels) to add another level of
local information by using nearest-neighbor relationships of local regions to
form a multi-view pipeline. The proposed multi-view multi-instance framework
utilizes both weak and strong labels effectively, and more importantly it has
the generalization ability to even boost the performance of unseen categories
by partial strong labels from other categories. Our framework is extensively

Gent and Peter Nightingale","Generalized Support and Formal Development of Constraint Propagators",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Constraint programming is a family of techniques for solving combinatorial
problems, where the problem is modelled as a set of decision variables
(typically with finite domains) and a set of constraints that express relations
among the decision variables. One key concept in constraint programming is
propagation: reasoning on a constraint or set of constraints to derive new
facts, typically to remove values from the domains of decision variables.
Specialised propagation algorithms (propagators) exist for many classes of
constraints.
  The concept of support is pervasive in the design of propagators.
Traditionally, when a domain value ceases to have support, it may be removed
because it takes part in no solutions. Arc-consistency algorithms such as
AC2001 make use of support in the form of a single domain value. GAC algorithms
such as GAC-Schema use a tuple of values to support each literal. We generalize
these notions of support in two ways. First, we allow a set of tuples to act as
support. Second, the supported object is generalized from a set of literals
(GAC-Schema) to an entire constraint or any part of it.
  We design a methodology for developing correct propagators using generalized
support. A constraint is expressed as a family of support properties, which may
be proven correct against the formal semantics of the constraint. Using
Curry-Howard isomorphism to interpret constructive proofs as programs, we show
how to derive correct propagators from the constructive proofs of the support
properties. The framework is carefully designed to allow efficient algorithms
to be produced. Derived algorithms may make use of dynamic literal triggers or
watched literals for efficiency. Finally, two case studies of deriving
efficient algorithms are given.

Detailed
numerical simulations and detailed asymptotic analysis of the process reveal a
self-similar structure both for the velocity field and the pressure field. The
latter is shown to exhibit a maximum not near the impact point, but rather at
the contact line. The motion of the contact line is furthermore shown to
exhibit a 'tank treading' motion. These observations are apprehended at the
light of a variant of Wagner theory for liquid impact. This framework offers a
simple analogy where the fluid motion within the impacting drop may be viewed
as the flow induced by a flat rising expanding disk. The theoretical
predictions are found to be in very close agreement both qualitatively and
quantitatively with the numerical observations for about three decades in time.
Interestingly the inviscid self-similar impact pressure and velocities are
shown to depend solely on the self-similar variables $(r/\sqrt{t},z/\sqrt{t})$.
The structure of the boundary layer developing along the wet substrate is
investigated as well, and is proven to be formally analogous to that of the
boundary layer growing in the trail of a shockwave. Interestingly, the boundary
layer structure only depends on the impact self-similar variables. This allows
to construct a seamless uniform analytical solution encompassing both impact
and viscous effects. The depiction of the different dynamical fields enables to
quantitatively predict observables of interest, such as the evolution of the
integral viscous shearing force and of the net normal force.

antennae to absorb further photons whilst retaining the excitations from those

peak power enhancement by up to a factor of 35 under ambient conditions owing
to a combination of ratcheting and the prevention of emission through
dark-state population. In the slow extraction limit the achievable power
enhancement due to ratcheting alone exceeds 20%.

guarded semantics, and for its packed n--variable fragments. Both are modal
fragments of L_n. As a sample, we show that if there exists a finite relation
algebra with a so--called strong l--blur, and no m--dimensional relational
basis, then there exists a countable, atomic and complete L_n theory T and type
\Gamma, such that \Gamma is realizable in every so--called m--square model of

$m$--square model M of T gives a form of clique guarded semantics, where the
parameter m, measures how locally well behaved M is. Every ordinary model is
k--square for any n<k<\omega, but the converse is not true. Any model M is
\omega--square, and the two notions are equivalent if M is countable.
  Such relation algebras are shown to exist for certain values of l and m like

m=\omega gives that the omitting types theorem fails for L_n with respect to
(usual) Tarskian semantics: There is an atomic countable L_n theory T for which
the single non--principal type consisting of co--atoms cannot be omitted in any
model M of T.
  For n<\omega, positive results on omitting types are obained for L_n by
imposing extra conditions on the theories and/or the types omitted. Positive

instantaneous feedback on their performance, as well as to calibrate a model of
the system that provides dynamical updates to the probability that a classified

constant volume, pressure, and total emissivity are expressed in terms of the
polylogarithm functions. The general expressions for the thermal radiative and
thermodynamic functions are applied for the study of thermal radiation of
liquid and solid zirconium carbide. These functions are calculated using
experimental data for the frequency dependence of the normal spectral
emissivity in the visible-near infrared range at the melting (freezing) point.
The gaps between the thermal radiative and thermodynamic functions of liquid
and solid zirconium carbide are observed. The general analytical expressions
obtained can easily be presented in wavenumber domain.

limits on rocket technology, but all have their own problems. A
Low-Earth-Orbit, LEO, rotovator-based space-elevator version called
'sling-on-a-ring' may overcome them. This mass-lifting system uses the spatial
stability of an orbital ring, accessorized for transfer and storage of momentum
and electrical power. A high-tensile-strength equatorial circum-terra loop of
colossal-carbon tube, CCT, fiber has solar-power and station-keeping units and
rotating sling modules. Long sling assemblies, ~600 km, periodically descend
into the atmosphere to ~13 km. At perigee, the sling rotational tip velocity
almost cancels the orbital-ring velocity relative to Earth surface.
Split-second timing detaches a ~10 ton payload from an ordinary aircraft and
jerks it into space by sling momentum, with the proven specific strength of
CCTs now under development. This system eliminates the immense mass in space of
other space-elevator systems, but needs extremely long (~100km) compressive
members. Conceptual analysis for mass reduction of these structures is the
subject of this paper.
