a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel similarity index,
which is efficient and parameter free, based on clustering ability. Here
clustering ability is defined as average clustering coefficient of nodes with
the same degree. The motivation of our idea is that common-neighbors are able
to contribute to the likelihood of forming a link because they own some ability
of clustering their neighbors together, and then clustering ability defined
here is a measure for this capacity. Experimental numerical simulations on both
real-world networks and modeled networks demonstrated the high accuracy and
high efficiency of the new similarity index compared with three well-known
common-neighbor based similarity indices: CN, AA and RA.

investigates the scaling behavior of the minimum total power needed to
communicate over AWGN channels as the target bit-error-probability tends to
zero. We focus on regular-LDPC codes and iterative message-passing decoders. We
analyze scaling behavior under two VLSI complexity models of decoding. One
model abstracts power consumed in processing elements (""node model""), and
another abstracts power consumed in wires which connect the processing elements
(""wire model""). We prove that a coding strategy using regular-LDPC codes with
Gallager-B decoding achieves order-optimal scaling of total power under the
node model. However, we also prove that regular-LDPC codes and iterative
message-passing decoders cannot meet existing fundamental limits on total power
under the wire model. Further, if the transmit energy-per-bit is bounded, total
power grows at a rate that is worse than uncoded transmission. Complementing
our theoretical results, we develop detailed physical models of decoding
implementations using post-layout circuit simulations. Our theoretical and
numerical results show that approaching fundamental limits on total power
requires increasing the complexity of both the code design and the
corresponding decoding algorithm as communication distance is increased or
error-probability is lowered.

earns the profit by reselling these units in an external consumer market. The
paper looks at three scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we look at unit
capacity sellers where per unit valuation is private information of each seller
and the revenue curve is concave. For this setting, we define two benchmarks.
We show that no randomized prior free auction can be constant competitive
against any of these two benchmarks. However, for a lightly constrained
benchmark we design a prior-free auction PEPA (Profit Extracting Procurement
Auction) which is 4-competitive and we show this bound is tight. Second, we
study a setting where the sellers have non-unit capacities that are common
knowledge and derive similar results. In particular, we propose a prior free
auction PEPAC (Profit Extracting Procurement Auction with Capacity) which is
truthful for any concave revenue curve. Third, we obtain results in the
inherently harder bi-dimensional case where per unit valuation as well as
capacities are private information of the sellers. We show that PEPAC is
truthful and constant competitive for the specific case of linear revenue
curves. We believe that this paper represents the first set of results on
single dimensional and bi-dimensional profit maximizing prior-free multi-unit

flat spacetime. In the physical Einstein frame we obtain an effective
Lagrangian of ""k-essence"" type with quadratic dependence on the scalar
""dilaton"" kinetic term X, with a remarkable effective potential possessing two
infinitely large flat regions as well as with nontrivial effective gauge
coupling constants running with the ""dilaton"" $\varphi$. Corresponding to the
each of the two flat regions we find ""vacuum"" configurations of the following
types: (i) $\varphi = const$ and a non-zero gauge field vacuum $\sqrt{-F^2}\neq
0$, which corresponds to a charge confining phase; (ii) X = const (""kinetic

sciences to reduce complex problems into a series of simpler subproblems. Since
1950s, these schemes have been widely used to solve problems in PDE and
control. Recently, large-scale optimization problems in machine learning,
signal processing, and imaging have created a resurgence of interest in
operator-splitting based algorithms because they often have simple
descriptions, are easy to code, and have (nearly) state-of-the-art performance
for large-scale optimization problems. Although operator splitting techniques
were introduced over 60 years ago, their importance has significantly increased
in the past decade.
  This paper introduces a new operator-splitting scheme for solving a variety
of problems that are reduced to a monotone inclusion of three operators, one of
which is cocoercive. Our scheme is very simple, and it does not reduce to any
existing splitting schemes. Our scheme recovers the existing forward-backward,
Douglas-Rachford, and forward-Douglas-Rachford splitting schemes as special
cases.
  Our new splitting scheme leads to a set of new and simple algorithms for a
variety of other problems, including the 3-set split feasibility problems,
3-objective minimization problems, and doubly and multiple regularization
problems, as well as the simplest extension of the classic ADMM from 2 to 3

modifications and enhancements that can improve the convergence rate in
practice, including an acceleration that achieves the optimal rate of
convergence for strongly monotone inclusions. Finally, we evaluate the
algorithm on several applications.

first chooses an action, then the follower plays his best response. The goal of

the leader's optimal strategy in certain Stackelberg games where the follower's
utility function (and thus the subsequent best response of the follower) is
unknown.
  Stackelberg games capture, for example, the following interaction between a
producer and a consumer. The producer chooses the prices of the goods he
produces, and then a consumer chooses to buy a utility maximizing bundle of
goods. The goal of the seller here is to set prices to maximize his
profit---his revenue, minus the production cost of the purchased bundle. It is
quite natural that the seller in this example should not know the buyer's
utility function. However, he does have access to revealed preference
feedback---he can set prices, and then observe the purchased bundle and his own
profit. We give algorithms for efficiently solving, in terms of both
computational and query complexity, a broad class of Stackelberg games in which
the follower's utility function is unknown, using only ""revealed preference""
access to it. This class includes in particular the profit maximization
problem, as well as the optimal tolling problem in nonatomic congestion games,

angle and expand it into a power series with respect to a small angle. The
first term of the expansion gives the TME minimum emittance while the
high-order terms are responsible for its modification. On the contrary of the
vague and entangled closed-form solution, the coefficients of the power series
are simple and clearly indicate conditions and limitations for emittance
reduction below the TME value. With the help of analytical predictions we
design a lattice cell with longitudinally varied bends demonstrating the
emittance less than that for the TME structure of the same bending angle.

low-dimensional linear/affine subspaces. It is the mathematical abstraction of
many important problems in computer vision, image processing and machine
learning. A line of recent work (4, 19, 24, 20) provided strong theoretical
guarantee for sparse subspace clustering (4), the state-of-the-art algorithm
for subspace clustering, on both noiseless and noisy data sets. It was shown
that under mild conditions, with high probability no two points from different
subspaces are clustered together. Such guarantee, however, is not sufficient
for the clustering to be correct, due to the notorious ""graph connectivity
problem"" (15). In this paper, we investigate the graph connectivity problem for
noisy sparse subspace clustering and show that a simple post-processing
procedure is capable of delivering consistent clustering under certain ""general
position"" or ""restricted eigenvalue"" assumptions. We also show that our
condition is almost tight with adversarial noise perturbation by constructing a
counter-example. These results provide the first exact clustering guarantee of

essential for improving performance as well as energy and spectral efficiency
in multichannel wireless systems. This problem has been a subject of extensive
study in the past decade, and the resulting dynamic and opportunistic channel
access schemes can bring potentially significant improvement over traditional
schemes. However, a common and severe limitation of these dynamic schemes is
that they almost always require some form of a priori knowledge of the channel
statistics. A natural remedy is a learning framework, which has also been
extensively studied in the same context, but a typical learning algorithm in
this literature seeks only the best static policy, with performance measured by
weak regret, rather than learning a good dynamic channel access policy. There
is thus a clear disconnect between what an optimal channel access policy can
achieve with known channel statistics that actively exploits temporal, spatial
and spectral diversity, and what a typical existing learning algorithm aims
for, which is the static use of a single channel devoid of diversity gain. In
this paper we bridge this gap by designing learning algorithms that track known
optimal or sub-optimal dynamic channel access and transmission scheduling
policies, thereby yielding performance measured by a form of strong regret, the
accumulated difference between the reward returned by an optimal solution when
a priori information is available and that by our online algorithm. We do so in
the context of two specific algorithms that appeared in [1] and [2],
respectively, the former for a multiuser single-channel setting and the latter
for a single-user multichannel setting. In both cases we show that our
algorithms achieve sub-linear regret uniform in time and outperforms the
standard weak-regret learning algorithms.

with the isotropic equivalent fireball energy, E_fb, as estimated within the
fireball model framework from X-ray afterglow observations of these bursts. The
uncertainty in E_gamma, which spans the range of ~10^51 erg to ~10^53.5 erg, is
approximately 25% on average, due mainly to the extrapolation from the BAT
detector band to the 15-2000 keV band. The uncertainty in E_fb is approximately
a factor of 2, due mainly to the X-ray measurements' scatter. We find E_gamma
and E_fb to be tightly correlated. The average(std) of {\eta}^11hr_gamma is
approximately log_10(E_gamma/(3{\epsilon} _eE^11hr_fb)) are -0.34(0.60), and
the upper limit on the intrinsic spread of {\eta}_gamma is approximately 0.5
({\epsilon}_e is the fraction of shocked plasma energy carried by electrons and
E^x hr_fb is inferred from the X-ray flux at x hours). We also find that E_fb
inferred from X-ray observations at 3 and 11 hours are similar, with an
average(std) of log_10(E^3hr_fb/E^11hr_fb) of 0.04(0.28). The small variance of
{\eta}_gamma implies that burst-to-burst variations in {\epsilon}_e and in the
efficiency of fireball energy conversion to gamma-rays are small, and suggests
that both are of order unity. The small variance of {\eta}_gamma and the
similarity of E^3hr_fb and E^11hr_fb further imply that {\epsilon}_e does not
vary significantly with shock Lorentz factor, and that for most bursts the
modification of fireball energy during the afterglow phase, by processes such
as radiative losses or extended duration energy injection, are not significant.
Finally, our results imply that if fireballs are indeed jets, then the jet
opening angle satisfies {\theta}>0.1 for most cases. [abridged]

nanoelectromechanical resonators based on black phosphorus crystals.
Facilitated by a highly efficient dry transfer technique, crystalline black
phosphorus flakes are harnessed to enable drumhead resonators vibrating at high
and very high frequencies (HF and VHF bands, up to ~100MHz). We investigate the
resonant vibrational responses from the black phosphorus crystals by devising
both electrical and optical excitation schemes, in addition to measuring the
undriven thermomechanical motions in these suspended nanostructures. Flakes
with thicknesses from ~200nm down to ~20nm clearly exhibit elastic
characteristics transitioning from the plate to the membrane regime. Both
frequency- and time-domain measurements of the nanomechanical resonances show
that very thin black phosphorus crystals hold interesting promises for moveable
and vibratory devices, and for semiconductor transducers where high-speed
mechanical motions could be coupled to the attractive electronic and
optoelectronic properties of black phosphorus.

$A$ is the set of its large Fourier coefficients. Known combinatorial results
on the structure of spectrum, such as Chang's theorem, become trivial in the
regime $|A| = |G|^\alpha $ whenever $\alpha \le c$, where $c \ge 1/2$ is some
absolute constant. On the other hand, there are statistical results, which
apply only to a noticeable fraction of the elements, which give nontrivial
bounds even to much smaller sets. One such theorem (due to Bourgain) goes as
follows. For a noticeable fraction of pairs $\gamma_1,\gamma_2 $ in the
spectrum, $\gamma_1+\gamma_2$ belongs to the spectrum of the same set with a
smaller threshold. Here we show that this result can be made combinatorial by
restricting to a large subset. That is, we show that for any set $A$ there
exists a large subset $A'$, such that the sumset of the spectrum of $A'$ has
bounded size. Our results apply to sets of size $|A| = |G|^{\alpha}$ for any

describing the mechanical resonant responses in free-standing black P
structures, by using a combination of analytical modeling and numerical
simulation. We find that thicker devices (>100nm) operating in the elastic
plate regime exhibit pronounced signatures of mechanical anisotropy, and can
lead to new multimode resonant characteristics in terms of mode sequences,
shapes, and orientational preferences that are unavailable in nanomechanical
resonators made of isotropic materials. In addition, through investigating
devices with different geometries, we identify the resonant response's
dependence on crystal orientation in asymmetric devices, and evaluate the
effects from the degree of anisotropy. The results suggest a pathway towards
harnessing the mechanical anisotropy in black P for building novel 2D
nanomechanical devices and resonant transducers with engineerable multimode

set of n items given a set of inconsistent and incomplete pairwise comparisons

applications in data analysis (e.g., ranking teams in sports data), computer
vision, and machine learning. We formulate the above problem of ranking with
incomplete noisy information as an instance of the group synchronization
problem over the group SO(2) of planar rotations, whose usefulness has been
demonstrated in numerous applications in recent years. Its least squares
solution can be approximated by either a spectral or a semidefinite programming
(SDP) relaxation, followed by a rounding procedure. We perform extensive
numerical simulations on both synthetic and real-world data sets, showing that
our proposed method compares favorably to other algorithms from the recent
literature. Existing theoretical guarantees on the group synchronization
problem imply lower bounds on the largest amount of noise permissible in the
ranking data while still achieving exact recovery. We propose a similar
synchronization-based algorithm for the rank-aggregation problem, which
integrates in a globally consistent ranking pairwise comparisons given by
different rating systems on the same set of items. We also discuss the problem
of semi-supervised ranking when there is available information on the ground
truth rank of a subset of players, and propose an algorithm based on SDP which
recovers the ranks of the remaining players. Finally, synchronization-based
ranking, combined with a spectral technique for the densest subgraph problem,
allows one to extract locally-consistent partial rankings, in other words, to
identify the rank of a small subset of players whose pairwise comparisons are
less noisy than the rest of the data, which other methods are not able to
identify.

outperforming maximum likelihood estimation, which does not use this

probability of failure $P>0$, we ask: what is the minimal value of $m$ so that
there is a distribution over $m \times n$ matrices $A$ with the property that
for any $x$, given $Ax$, we can recover a $k$-sparse approximation to $x$ in
the given norm with probability at least $1-P$? We give a partial answer to

the optimal number of measurements $m$ is closely related to the doubling

rigorously that, under certain stability assumptions, its asymptotic

us to empirically validate the key assumptions of the analysis.

introducing meV-resolved IXS in Japan, including designing and helping to build
two IXS beamlines, spectrometers and associated instrumentation, performing

is followed by a brief discussion of calculations and then a longer section on
spectrometer design, concepts, and implementation, including a brief
introduction to dynamical diffraction and a survey of presently available

joint multiple symbol differential detection (MSDD) and channel decoding scheme
for noncoherent differential ultra-wideband impulse radio (UWB-IR) systems.
MSDD is an effective means to improve the performance of noncoherent
differential UWB-IR systems. To optimize the overall detection and decoding
performance, in this paper, we propose a novel soft-in soft-out (SISO) MSDD
scheme and its integration with SISO channel decoding for noncoherent
differential UWB-IR. we first propose a new auto-correlation receiver (AcR)
architecture to sample the received UWB-IR signal. The proposed AcR can exploit
the dependencies (imposed by the differential modulation) among data symbols
throughout the whole packet. The signal probabilistic model has a hidden Markov
chain structure. We use a factor graph to represent this hidden Markov chain.
Then, we apply BP message passing algorithm on the factor graph to develop a
SISO MSDD scheme, which has better performance than the previous MSDD scheme
and is easy to be integrated with SISO channel decoding to form a joint MSDD
and channel decoding scheme. Simulation results indicate the performance
advantages of our MSDD scheme and joint MSDD and channel decoding scheme.

spectrum, whereas circular polarization leads to an isotropic gapped one. As a
consequence, the stationary (dc) electronic transport in graphene strongly
depends on parameters of the dressing field: A circularly polarized field
monotonically decreases the isotropic conductivity of graphene, whereas a
linearly polarized one results in both giant anisotropy of conductivity (which
can reach thousands of percents) and the oscillating behavior of the

some finite separation are employed to predict the di-gamma, di-leptonic and

AGNs, we estimate the fraction of non-stellar light by comparing the nuclear
equivalent width of the stellar 2.3 micron CO absorption feature with the
intrinsic value for each galaxy. We compare this fraction to that derived from
a spectral decomposition of the integrated light in the central arc second and
find them to be consistent with each other. Using our estimates of the near-IR
AGN light, we find a strong correlation with presumably isotropic AGN tracers.
We show that a significant offset exists between type 1 and type 2 sources in
the sense that type 1 sources are 7 (10) times brighter in the near-IR at log
L_MIR = 42.5 (log L_X = 42.5). These offsets only becomes clear when treating
infrared type 1 sources as type 1 AGNs.
  All AGNs have very red near-to-mid-IR dust colors. This, as well as the range
of observed near-IR temperatures, can be explained with a simple model with
only two free parameters: the obscuration to the hot dust and the ratio between
the warm and hot dust areas. We find obscurations of A_V (hot) = 5 - 15 mag for
infrared type 1 sources and A_V (hot) = 15 - 35 mag for type 2 sources. The
ratio of hot dust to warm dust areas of about 1000 is nicely consistent with
the ratio of radii of the respective regions as found by infrared
interferometry.

> 20 times hotter X-ray temperatures and > 10 times higher X-ray luminosities
than normal. This group of Be stars, dubbed Gamma-Cas analogs, contains about
10 known objects. The origin of this bizarre behavior has been extensively
debated in the past decades. Two mechanisms have been put forward, accretion of
circumstellar disk matter onto an orbiting white dwarf, or magnetic field
interaction between the star and the circumstellar disk (Smith & Robinson
1999). We show here that the X-ray and optical emissions of the prototype of
the class, Gamma-Cas, are very well correlated on year time scales with no
significant time delay. Since the expected migration time from internal disk
regions that emit most of the optical flux to the orbit of the companion star
is of several years, the simultaneity of the high energy and optical fluxes
variations indicates that X-ray emission arises from close to the star. The
systematic lack of magnetic field detection reported in recent
spectro-polarimetric surveys of Be stars is consistent with the absence of
strong magnetic wind braking in these fast spinning stars but put strong
constraints on the possible origin of the magnetic field. We propose that in
Gamma-Cas the magnetic field emerges from equatorially condensed subsurface
convecting layers the thickness of which steeply increases with rotation rate
and that Gamma-Cas and its analogs are the most massive and closest to critical
rotation Be stars

observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Global Oscillation
Network Group (GONG) are carried out to analyze the two filaments on 2013
August 17-20 and September 29. The first event showed that the main body of the
filament was separated into two parts when an active region (AR) emerged with a
maximum magnetic flux of about 6.4*10^21 Mx underlying the filament. The close
neighborhood and common direction of the bright threads in the filament and the
open AR fan loops suggest similar magnetic connectivity of these two flux
systems. The equilibrium of the filament was not destroyed within 3 days after
the start of the emergence of the AR. To our knowledge, similar observations
have never been reported before. In the second event, the emerging flux
occurred nearby a barb of the filament with a maximum magnetic flux of
4.2*10^20 Mx, about one order of magnitude less than that of the first event.
The emerging flux drove the convergence of two patches of parasitic polarity in
the vicinity of the barb, and resulted in cancellation between the parasitic
polarity and nearby network fields. About 20 hours after the onset of the
emergence, the filament was entirely erupted. Our findings imply that the
location of emerging flux within the filament channel is probably crucial to
filament evolution. If the flux emergence appears nearby the barbs, flux
cancellation of emerging flux with the filament magnetic fields is prone to
occur, which probably causes the filament eruption. The comparison of the two
events shows that the emergence of an entire AR may still not be enough to
disrupt the stability of a filament system and the actual eruption does occur
only after the flux cancellation sets in.

Moreover, a scattering operator can be defined if the $\lambda$ values admit
advanced and retarded Green operators. In general, however, the Cauchy-problem

explained that potential terms arising from non-commutative products on

transport systems and wave propagation on networks is robust with respect to
variations of the lengths of the edges of the network preserving their rational

exponentially stable if and only if the network is a tree and the damping is

evaluated must also be used to learn the database-vector. The algorithm only
has access to a binary oracle $\mathcal{O}$ that answers whether a particular
linear function of the database-vector plus random noise is larger than a
threshold, which is specified by the algorithm. We note that we allow for a
significant $O(D)$ amount of noise to be added while other works focused on the
low noise $o(\sqrt{D})$-setting. For a stream of $T$ queries our algorithm
achieves an average error $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ by filtering out
random noise, adapting threshold values given to the oracle based on its
previous answers and, as a consequence, recovering with high precision a
projection of a database-vector $w^{*}$ onto the manifold defining the
query-space.

  clustering approach",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ranking is one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning with
applications in many branches of computer science such as: information
retrieval systems, recommendation systems, machine translation and
computational biology. Ranking objects based on possibly conflicting
preferences is a central problem in voting research and social choice theory.
In this paper we present a new simple combinatorial ranking algorithm adapted
to the preference-based setting. We apply this new algorithm to the well-known
scenario where the edges of the preference tournament are determined by the
majority-voting model. It outperforms existing methods when it cannot be
assumed that there exists global ranking of good enough quality and applies
combinatorial techniques that havent been used in the ranking context before.
Performed experiments show the superiority of the new algorithm over existing
methods, also over these that were designed to handle heavily perturbed
statistics. By combining our techniques with those presented in \cite{mohri},
we obtain a purely combinatorial algorithm that answers correctly most of the
queries in the heterogeneous scenario, where the preference tournament is only
locally of good quality but is not necessarily pseudotransitive. As a byproduct
of our methods, we obtain the algorithm solving clustering problem for the
directed planted partition model. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first
purely combinatorial algorithm tackling this problem.

many applications in computer science. In this paper we study coloring
tournaments. A chromatic number of a random tournament is of order
$\Omega(\frac{n}{\log(n)})$. The question arises whether the chromatic number
can be proven to be smaller for more structured nontrivial classes of
tournaments. We analyze the class of tournaments defined by a forbidden
subtournament $H$. This paper gives a first quasi-polynomial algorithm running
in time $e^{O(\log(n)^{2})}$ that constructs colorings of $H$-free tournaments
using only $O(n^{1-\epsilon(H)}\log(n))$ colors, where $\epsilon(H) \geq
2^{-2^{50|H|^{2}+1}}$ for many forbidden tournaments $H$. To the best of our
knowledge all previously known related results required at least
sub-exponential time and relied on the regularity lemma. Since we do not use
the regularity lemma, we obtain the first known lower bounds on $\epsilon(H)$
that can be given by a closed-form expression. As a corollary, we give a
constructive proof of the celebrated open Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture with
explicitly given lower bounds on the EH coefficients for all classes of prime
tournaments for which the conjecture is known. Such a constractive proof was
not known before. Thus we significantly reduce the gap between best lower and
upper bounds on the EH coefficients from the conjecture for all known prime
tournaments that satisfy it. We also briefly explain how our methods may be
used for coloring $H$-free tournaments under the following conditions: $H$ is
any tournament with $\leq 5$ vertices or: $H$ is any but one tournament of six
vertices.

investigate how to associate them across time. This is done by propagating
labels on a set of graphs, each graph capturing how either the spatio-temporal
or the appearance cues promote the assignment of identical or distinct labels
to a pair of detections. The graph construction is motivated by a locally
linear embedding of the detection features. Interestingly, the neighborhood of
a node in appearance graph is defined to include all the nodes for which the
appearance feature is available (even if they are temporally distant). This
gives our framework the uncommon ability to exploit the appearance features
that are available only sporadically. Once the graphs have been defined,
multi-object tracking is formulated as the problem of finding a label
assignment that is consistent with the constraints captured each graph, which
results into a difference of convex (DC) program. We propose to decompose the
global objective function into node-wise sub-problems. This not only allows a
computationally efficient solution, but also supports an incremental and
scalable construction of the graph, thereby making the framework applicable to
large graphs and practical tracking scenarios. Moreover, it opens the
possibility of parallel implementation.

Higgs boson decay $h\to\mu\tau$, as observed by the CMS collaboration recently,
can be explained by a certain class of two-Higgs doublet models that allow
controllable flavor-changing neutral current with minimal number of free
parameters. We postulate that (i) the alignment limit is maintained, which
means the lightest neutral scalar ($h$) has identical couplings to that of the
Standard Model Higgs boson and (ii) the signal comes from two other neutral
scalars, the CP-even $H$ and the CP-odd $A$, almost degenerate with $h$ at 125
GeV. We also show that (i) it is entirely possible that these scalars are
hidden, apart from this LFV signal; (ii) the signal strengths of $b\bar{b}$,
$\tau^+\tau^-$ and $\gamma\gamma$ around 125 GeV put severe constraints on the
parameter space of such models; (iii) the constraint is further enhanced by the
non-observation of processes like $\mu\to e\gamma$, and we predict that the
branching ratio of $\mu\to e\gamma$ cannot be even an order below the present
experimental limit, highlighting the role it plays in forcing $H$ and $A$ to be
near-degenerate; (iv) an enhancement in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ production
cross-section at around 125 GeV is expected in the gluon fusion channel, and
should be observed during the next run of the LHC; (v) the branching ratio in
the $e\tau$ channel is enhanced and is expected to be at least about $2\%$. The
constrained parameter space and minimum number of free parameters, along with
such strong predictions, make this model easily testable and falsifiable.

WISE data, the MIRDD, we compare narrow emission-line galaxies (NELGs) that
exhibit different activity types (star-forming galaxies, SFGs, and AGNs,
i.e.,LINERs, Sy2s and TOs), with broad-line AGNs (QSOs and Sy1s) and BL Lac
objects at low redshift ($z \le 0.25$). We show that the BL Lac objects occupy
in the MIRDD the same region as the LINERs, whereas the QSOs and Sy1s occupy an
intermediate region, between the LINERs and the Sy2s.In the MIRDD these
galaxies trace a sequence that can be reproduced by a power law, $F_\nu =
\nu^{\alpha}$, where the spectral index, $\alpha$, varies from 0 to $-2$, which
is similar to what is observed in the optical-ultraviolet part of the spectra
of AGNs with different luminosities.
  For the NELGs, we perform a stellar population synthesis analysis,
demonstrating that the ${\rm W}2-{\rm W}3$ color is tightly correlated with the
level of star formation in their host galaxies. A comparison of their MIR
colors with the colors yielded by energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies with
different activity types, shows that the SED of the LINERs is similar to the
SEDs of the QSOs and Sy1s, consistent with AGN galaxies with mild star
formation, whereas the SEDs of the Sy2s and TOs are consistent with AGN
galaxies with strong star formation components. For the BL Lac objects, we can
only fit a SED that has no star formation component, consistent with AGNs in
elliptical-type galaxies.
  From their similarities in MIR colors and SEDs, we infer that, in the nearby
universe, the level of star formation activity most probably increases in the
host galaxies of emission-line galaxies with different activity types along the
sequence BL

comparing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models and their hydrodynamic (HD)
counterparts in the broad range of rotation rate and in varying initial
rotation profile. Fully-compressible MHD simulations of rotating penetrative
convection are performed in a full-spherical shell geometry. Critical
conditions for the transition of the differential rotation between faster
equator (solar-type) and slower equator (anti-solar type) are explored with
focusing on the ""Rossby number (${\rm Ro}$)"" and the ""convective Rossby number
(${\rm Ro}_{\rm conv}$)"". It is confirmed that the transition is more gradual
and the critical value for it is higher in the MHD model than the HD model in
the view of the ${\rm Ro}_{\rm conv}$-dependence. The rotation profile shows,
as observed in earlier studies, the bistability near the transition in the HD
model, while it disappears when allowing the growth of magnetic fields except
for the model with taking anti-solar type solution as the initial condition. We
find that the transition occurs at ${\rm Ro} \simeq 1$ both in the MHD and HD
models independently of the hysteresis. Not only the critical value, the
sharpness of the transition is also similar between the two models in the view
of the ${\rm Ro}$-dependence. The influences of the dynamo-generated magnetic
field and/or the hysteresis on convective motion are reflected in the ${\rm
Ro}$. This would be the reason why the transition is unified in the view of the
${\rm Ro}$-dependence. We finally discuss the ${\rm Ro}$-dependence of magnetic
dynamo activities with emphasis on its possible relation to the kinetic
helicity profile.

simple geometric model. For two twins in a closed space, a real paradox seems
to emerge when the traveling twin is moving uniformly along a geodesic and
returns to the starting point without turning back. Accordingly, the reference
frames (RF) of both twins seem to be equivalent, which makes the twin paradox
irresolvable: each twin can claim to be at rest and therefore to have aged more
than the partner upon their reunion. In reality, the paradox has the resolution
in this case as well. Apart from distinction between the two RF with respect to
actual forces in play, they can be distinguished by clock synchronization. A
closed space singles out a truly stationary RF with single-valued global time;
in all other frames, time is not a single-valued parameter. This implies that
even uniform motion along a spatial geodesic in a compact space is not truly
inertial, and there is an effective force on an object in such motion.
Therefore, the traveling twin will age less upon circumnavigation than the
stationary one, just as in flat space-time. Ironically, Relativity in this case
emerges free of paradoxes at the price of bringing back the pre-Galilean
concept of absolute rest.
  An example showing the absence of paradoxes is also considered for a more
realistic case of a time-evolving closed space.
