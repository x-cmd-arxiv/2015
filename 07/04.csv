hierarchies in a model-independent way. Guided by the existence of such
relations in the quark sector, we first consider all the mixing angles, both in
charged lepton and neutrino sectors to be related to the respective mass
ratios. This allows us to calculate the leptonic mixing angles observed in
neutrino oscillations as functions of the lightest neutrino mass. We show that
for both normal and inverted hierarchical neutrino masses, this scenario does
not give rise to correct leptonic mixing angles. We then show that correct
leptonic mixing angles can be generated with normal hierarchical neutrino
masses if the relation between mixing angle and mass ratio is restricted to 1-2
and 1-3 mixing in both charged lepton and neutrino sectors leaving the 2-3
mixing angles as free parameters. We then restrict the lightest neutrino mass
as well as the difference between 2-3 mixing angles in charged lepton and
neutrino sectors from the requirement of producing correct leptonic mixing
angles. We constrain the lightest neutrino mass to be around $0.002$ eV and
leptonic Dirac CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ such that
$\sin^2{\delta_{CP}}\sim(0.35-0.50)$. We also construct the leptonic mass
matrices in terms of $2-3$ mixing angles and lightest neutrino mass and briefly
comment on the possibility of realizing texture zeros in the neutrino mass
matrix.

the sub-channels associated with them as being vacant. Analytical and

techniques to calibrate a relation between galaxy star formation rate (SFR) and
host halo mass M$_{h}$ by mapping the shape of the observed SFRFs at z~4-8 to
that of the halo mass function. The resulting scaling law remains roughly
constant over this redshift range. We apply the average SFR-M$_{h}$ relation to
reproduce the observed SFR functions at 4 <= z <= 8 and also derive the
expected UV LFs at higher redshifts. At z~9 and z~10 these model LFs are in
excellent agreement with current observed estimates. Our predicted number
densities and UV LFs at z>10 indicate that JWST will be able to detect galaxies
out to z~15 with an extensive treasury sized program. We also derive the
redshift evolution of the star formation rate density and associated
reionization history by galaxies. Models which integrate down to the current
HUDF12/XDF detection limit (M$_{UV}$ ~ -17.7 mag) result in a SFRD that
declines as (1+z)$^{-10.4\pm0.3}$ at high redshift and fail to reproduce the
observed CMB electron scattering optical depth, $\tau$ ~ 0.066, to within
1$\sigma$. On the other hand, we find that the inclusion of galaxies with SFRs
well below the current detection limit (M$_{UV}$ < -5.7 mag) leads to a fully

consistent with the recently derived Planck value at the 1$\sigma$ level.

two different contributions: a flux originated by known astrophysical sources

component where the most energetic neutrinos come from the leptophilic
three-body decays of dark matter particles with a mass of few PeV. Differently
from other approaches, we provide two examples of elementary particle models
that do not require extremely tiny coupling constants. We find the
compatibility of the theoretical predictions with the IceCube results when the
astrophysical flux has a cutoff of the order of 100 TeV (broken power law). In
this case the most energetic part of the spectrum (PeV neutrinos) is due to an
extra component such as the decay of a very massive dark matter component. Due
to the low statistics at our disposal we have considered for simplicity the
equivalence between deposited and neutrino energy, however such approximation
does not affect dramatically the qualitative results. Of course, a purely
astrophysical origin of the neutrino flux (no cutoff in energy below the PeV
scale - unbroken power law) is still allowed. If future data will confirm the
presence of a sharp cutoff above few PeV this would be in favor of a dark
matter interpretation.

bright GHz-band millisecond pulses of unknown origin. Proposed explanations
cover a broad range from exotic processes at cosmological distances to
atmospheric and terrestrial sources. Loeb et al. have previously suggested that
FRB sources could be nearby flare stars, and pointed out the presence of a
W-UMa-type contact binary within the beam of one out of three FRB fields that
they examined. Using time-domain optical photometry and spectroscopy, we now
find possible flare stars in additional FRB fields, with one to three such
cases among eight FRB fields studied. We evaluate the chance probabilities of
these possible associations to be in the range 0.1% to 9%, depending on the
input assumptions. Further, we re-analyze the probability that two FRBs
recently discovered 3 years apart within the same radio beam are unrelated.
Contrary to other claims, we conclude with 99% confidence that the two events
are from the same repeating source. The different dispersion measures between
the two bursts then rule out a cosmological origin for the dispersion measure,
but are consistent with the flare-star scenario with a varying plasma blanket
between bursts. Finally, we review some theoretical objections that have been

experimentally test a largely simplified scheme in which the Gaussian

asymptotically secure against collective attacks, and considers asymmetric

the need for a costly amplitude modulator unnecessary, and thus facilitates
commercialization of continuous-variable quantum key distribution.

investigation of any such relation with molecular gas content. In this work, we
assemble a sample of 221 galaxies from a variety of surveys in the redshift

against both molecular and total gas mass. We then employ a principle component
analysis technique to explore secondary dependences in the mass-metallicity
relation, finding that the secondary dependence with gas mass is significantly
stronger than with star formation rate, and as such the underlying `Fundamental
Metallicity Relation' is between stellar mass, metallicity, and gas mass. In
particular, the metallicity dependence on SFR is simply a byproduct of the
dependence on the molecular gas content, via the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation.
Finally, we note that our principle component analysis finds essentially no
connection between gas-phase metallicity and the efficiency of star formation.

the uncertainty in the reddening distribution along each line of sight, as well
as stellar distances, reddenings and classifications for 800 million stars

In particular, we find agreement with the Planck 353 GHz optical depth-based

systematics at reddenings less than E(B-V) ~ 0.08 mag. We validate our per-star

that have not been previously applied to the drag-coupled dust problem and
which are particularly relevant to self-gravitating protoplanetary discs. Our
tests demonstrate several key requirements for accurate simulations of gas-dust

solution, even when the gas density is well reproduced. The use of integral
gradients, a Wendland kernel and a large number of neighbours can control this,
albeit at a greater computational cost. Secondly, when it is necessary to limit
the artificial viscosity we recommend using the Cullen & Dehnen (2010) switch,
since the alternative, using ${\alpha} \sim 0.1$, can generate a large velocity
noise up to ${{\sigma}_v} \lesssim 0.3 c_s$ in the dust particles. Thirdly, we
find that an accurate dust density estimate requires $>400$ neighbours, since,
unlike the gas, the dust particles do not feel regularization forces. This
density noise applies to all particle-based two-fluid implementations of dust,
irrespective of the hydro solver and could lead to numerically induced
fragmentation. Although our tests show accurate dusty gas simulations are
possible, care must be taken to minimize the contribution from numerical noise.

successes of the LambdaCDM model on cosmological scales while simultaneously
reproducing the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) phenomenology on galactic
scales. The DM and MOND components have a common origin, representing different
phases of a single underlying substance. DM consists of axion-like particles
with mass of order eV and strong self-interactions. The condensate has a
polytropic equation of state P~rho^3 giving rise to a superfluid core within
galaxies. Instead of behaving as individual collisionless particles, the DM
superfluid is more aptly described as collective excitations. Superfluid
phonons, in particular, are assumed to be governed by a MOND-like effective
action and mediate a MONDian acceleration between baryonic matter particles.
Our framework naturally distinguishes between galaxies (where MOND is
successful) and galaxy clusters (where MOND is not): due to the higher velocity
dispersion in clusters, and correspondingly higher temperature, the DM in
clusters is either in a mixture of superfluid and normal phase, or fully in the
normal phase. The rich and well-studied physics of superfluidity leads to a
number of observational signatures: array of low-density vortices in galaxies,
merger dynamics that depend on the infall velocity vs phonon sound speed;
distinct mass peaks in bullet-like cluster mergers, corresponding to superfluid
and normal components; interference patters in super-critical mergers.
Remarkably, the superfluid phonon effective theory is strikingly similar to
that of the unitary Fermi gas, which has attracted much excitement in the cold
atom community in recent years. The critical temperature for DM superfluidity
is of order mK, comparable to known cold atom Bose-Einstein condensates.

finite automaton $M_L$ that after each finite execution tells whether (1) every
possible extension of the execution is in $L$, or (2) every possible extension

`soft' uncompressed grains in a granular chain where the grains interact via
the intrinsically nonlinear Hertz force. It is well known that such a chain
supports the formation of solitary waves (SWs). Here, however, the system
response to the material properties of the grains and boundaries is further
explored. In particular, we examine the details of the transition of the system
from a SW phase to an equilibrium-like (or quasi-equilibrium) phase and for
this reason we ignore the effects of dissipation in this study. We find that
the soft walls slow the reflection of SWs at the boundaries of the system,
which in turn slows the journey to quasi-equilibrium. Moreover, the increased
grain-wall compression as the boundaries are softened results in fewer average
grain-grain contacts at any given time in the quasi-equilibrium phase. These
effects lead to increased kinetic energy fluctuations in the short term in
softer systems. We conclude with a toy model which exploits the results of
soft-wall systems. This toy model supports the formation of breather-like
entities and may therefore be useful for localizing energy in desired places in
the granular chain.

processes. In this thesis, rat brain and red bone marrow images are acquired
using iMQCs (intermolecular multiple quantum coherences) between intermediate
separated spins. As an important application, iMQCs images in different
directions can be used for anisotropy mapping and tissue microstructure
analysis. At the same time, the simulations prove that the dipolar field from
the overall shape only has small contributions to the experimental iMQC signal.
Besides magnitude of iMQCs, phase of iMQCs should be studied as well. The phase
anisotropy maps built by our method can clearly show susceptibility information
in rat brain. It may provide meaningful diagnostic information. To deeply study
susceptibility, the modified-crazed sequence is developed. Combining phase data

two-stage algorithmic implementation of the local linear approximation to a
family of folded concave penalized quasi-likelihood. The first stage solves a
convex program with a crude precision tolerance to obtain a coarse initial
estimator, which is further refined in the second stage by iteratively solving
a sequence of convex programs with smaller precision tolerances. Theoretically,
we establish a phase transition: the first stage has a sublinear iteration
complexity, while the second stage achieves an improved linear rate of
convergence. Though this framework is completely algorithmic, it provides
solutions with optimal statistical performances and controlled algorithmic
complexity for a large family of nonconvex optimization problems. The iteration
effects on statistical errors are clearly demonstrated via a contraction
property. Our theory relies on a localized version of the sparse/restricted
eigenvalue condition, which allows us to analyze a large family of loss and
penalty functions and provide optimality guarantees under very weak assumptions
(For example, I-LAMM requires much weaker minimal signal strength than other
procedures). Thorough numerical results are provided to support the obtained

places no restrictions on the length scales of the viscous and thermal boundary
layer thicknesses $\delta_\mathrm{s}$ and $\delta_\mathrm{t}$ relative to the

the acoustic wavelength $\lambda$. This is the limit relevant to scattering of
sound and ultrasound waves from micrometer-sized particles. For particles of

Bayesian control chart used to compare two processes. The chart monitors the
ratio of the percentiles of a key characteristic associated with the processes.
The variability of such a characteristic is modeled via the Weibull
distribution and a practical Bayesian approach to deal with Weibull data is
adopted. The percentiles of the two monitored processes are assumed to be
independent random variables. The Weibull distributions of the key
characteristic of both processes are assumed to have the same and stable shape
parameter. This is usually experienced in practice because the Weibull shape
parameter is related to the main involved factor of variability. However, if a
change of the shape parameters of the processes is suspected, the involved
distributions can be used to monitor their stability. We first tested the
effects of the number of the training data on the responsiveness of the chart.
Then we tested the robustness of the chart in spite of very poor prior
information. To this end, the prior values were changed to reflect a 50% shift
in both directions from the original values of the shape parameter and the
percentiles of the two monitored processes. Finally, various combinations of
shifts were considered for the sampling distributions after the Phase I, with
the purpose of estimating the diagnostic ability of the charts to signal an
out-of-control state. The traditional approach based on the Average Run Length,
empirically computed via a Monte Carlo simulation, was adopted.

Kp is the best single parameter to specify the statistical ULF wave power

interest but a quantitative theoretical description is still lacking. We
present and validate a minimal continuum theory for this new class of active

account for the experimentally observed spontaneous buckling of motor-driven

published data and predicts a regime of antipolar order. Our analysis implies
that ALCs are governed by the same generic ordering principles that determine
the non-equilibrium dynamics of dense bacterial suspensions and elastic bilayer

nanodroplets within a vacuum, using molecular dynamics simulation techniques.
Programs written in MATLAB and C are utilized in tandem to facilitate computer
experimentation that achieves this goal. The most expensive computation, that
of collision simulation, is handled by a HPC cluster `ALICE' at the University
of Leicester.
  Colliding droplets are modelled as roughly spherical collections of points,
cut from a simple cubic lattice, obeying a modified Lennard-Jones potential,
with average velocities initialized to ensure a `head-on' collision. These
point-sets are then allowed to collide within a cuboid region, designed to take
advantage of the observed angular distribution of post-collision fragmentation
(favoring a plane orthogonal to `collision axis').
  To implement the developed theoretical model, an existing C script by D. C.
Rapaport, for modelling a homogeneous liquid state, is edited by the author to
fit the given, highly heterogeneous scenario. To do analysis on the resulting
positions and velocities of points in time, a precise definition of `droplet'
was required. An object is defined, from the perspective of metric space, to
satisfy this need. An existing cluster analysis algorithm, DBSCAN, is used to
apply this definition to the points in simulation.
  The results presented here focus on three distinct properties of
post-collision droplets, these being size, speed and temperature; for collision
speed varying across ten equidistant averages chosen based on visual
examination of collisions. Quantitative evidence of post-collision droplet
speed being inversely proportional to droplet radius is presented, droplet
temperature distribution post-collision is noted, and qualitative change in
collision behavior across a certain threshold of collision speed is observed.

Then, we formulate the CFM optimization as a semidefinite programming problem
and propose an efficient optimization procedure with Hazan's algorithm. A key
advantage of CFM over existing FMs is that it can find a globally optimal
solution, while FMs may get a poor locally optimal solution since the objective
function of FMs is non-convex. In addition, the proposed algorithm is simple
yet effective and can be implemented easily. Finally, CFM is a general
factorization method and can also be used for other factorization problems
including including multi-view matrix factorization and tensor completion
problems. Through synthetic and movielens datasets, we first show that the
proposed CFM achieves results competitive to FMs. Furthermore, in a
toxicogenomics prediction task, we show that CFM outperforms a state-of-the-art
tensor factorization method.

change in the polarization direction is experimentally demonstrated in weakly

electrodynamics (QED) in strong electromagnetic fields. The scattering of
linearly polarized incident probe photons into a perpendicularly polarized mode
provides a distinct signature of the optical activity of the quantum vacuum and
thus offers an excellent opportunity for a precision test of non-linear QED.
Precision tests require accurate predictions and thus a theoretical framework
that is capable of taking the detailed experimental geometry into account. We
derive analytical solutions for vacuum birefringence which include the
spatio-temporal field structure of a strong optical pump laser field and an
x-ray probe. We show that the angular distribution of the scattered photons
depends strongly on the interaction geometry and find that scattering of the
perpendicularly polarized scattered photons out of the cone of the incident
probe x-ray beam is the key to making the phenomenon experimentally accessible
with the current generation of FEL/high-field laser facilities.

a system of $N$ two-dimensional Brownian particles interacting through a
singular attractive kernel in the drift term. In the very subcritical case
$\chi\textless{}2\pi$, the diffusion strongly dominates this singular drift: we
obtain existence for the particle system and prove that its flow of empirical
measures converges, as $N\to\infty$ and up to extraction of a subsequence, to a
weak solution of the Keller-Segel equation. We also show that for any $N\ge 2$

positive probability: the singularity of the drift is indeed visited.
Nevertheless, when $\chi\textless{}2\pi N$, it is possible to control the drift

three particles collide. We check that this time is a.s. infinite, so that
global existence holds for the particle system, if and only if $\chi\leq

the difference between the two positions provides a natural two-dimensional

finite group presentations, can be considered in several fashions, depending on
the way these objects are represented and on the distribution assumed on these
representations: here we assume that they are represented by tuples of reduced
words (generators of a subgroup) or of cyclically reduced words (relators).
Classical models consider fixed size tuples of words (e.g. the few-generator
model) or exponential size tuples (e.g. Gromov's density model), and they
usually consider that equal length words are equally likely. We generalize both
the few-generator and the density models with probabilistic schemes that also
allow variability in the size of tuples and non-uniform distributions on words
of a given length.Our first results rely on a relatively mild prefix-heaviness
hypothesis on the distributions, which states essentially that the probability
of a word decreases exponentially fast as its length grows. Under this
hypothesis, we generalize several classical results: exponentially generically
a randomly chosen tuple is a basis of the subgroup it generates, this subgroup
is malnormal and the tuple satisfies a small cancellation property, even for
exponential size tuples. In the special case of the uniform distribution on
words of a given length, we give a phase transition theorem for the central
tree property, a combinatorial property closely linked to the fact that a tuple
freely generates a subgroup. We then further refine our results when the
distribution is specified by a Markovian scheme, and in particular we give a
phase transition theorem which generalizes the classical results on the
densities up to which a tuple of cyclically reduced words chosen uniformly at
random exponentially generically satisfies a small cancellation property, and
beyond which it presents a trivial group.

  Aims. We search for the microlensing effect in the gamma-ray band using the
signal from a gravitationally lensed blazar B0218+357.
  Methonds. We develop a method of deconvolution of contributions of two images
of the source into the gamma-ray band flaring lightcurve. We use this method to
study the evolution of the magnification factor ratio between the two images
throughout the flaring episodes. We interpret the time variability of the ratio
as a signature of the microlensing effect and derive constraints on the
physical parameters of the gamma-ray source by comparing the observed
variability properties of the magnification factor ratio with those derived
from numerical simulations of the microlensing caustics networks.
  Results. We find that the magnification factor ratio has experienced a change
characteristic for a microlensing caustic crossing event during a 100 d flaring
period in 2012. It has further changed between 2012 and a recent flaring
episode in 2014. We use the measurement of the maximal magnification and
duration of the caustic crossing event to derive an estimate of the projected
size of the gamma-ray emission region in B0218+357, $R_\gamma \sim 10^{14}$ cm.
This estimate is compatible with a complementary estimate found from the
minimal variability time scale. The microlensing / minimal variability time
scale measurements of the source size suggest that the gamma-ray emission is
produced at the base of the blazar jet, in the direct vicinity of the central
supermassive black hole.

Lifshitz transitions induced by pressure and zero point lattice fluctuations.
It is known that pressure could induce changes of the topology of the Fermi
surface, called Lifshitz transitions, but were neglected in previous papers on
the H$_3$S superconductivity issue. Here we propose that H3S is a multi-gap
superconductor with a first condensate in the BCS regime (in the large Fermi
surface with high Fermi energy) which coexists with a second condensates in the
BCS-BEC crossover regime (located on a small Fermi surface spots with small
Fermi energy) near the $\Gamma$ and M point. We discuss the need of
Bianconi-Perali-Valletta (BPV) superconductivity theory for superconductivity
in H3S. It includes both the correction of the chemical potential due to
pairing and the configuration interaction between different condensates,
neglected by the Eliashberg theory. Here the shape resonance in superconducting
gaps, similar to Feshbach resonance in ultracold gases, gives a relevant
contribution to amplify the critical temperature. Therefore this work provides
some key tools needed in the search for new room temperature superconductors.

problem, which seeks to simultaneously find an assignment and allocation that
maximizes the total utility of the threads. Assigning and allocating the
threads together can result in substantially better overall utility than
performing the steps separately, as is traditionally done. We model each thread
by a utility function giving its performance as a function of its assigned
resources. We first prove that the AA problem is NP-hard. We then present a $2
(\sqrt{2}-1) > 0.828$ factor approximation algorithm for concave utility
functions, which runs in $O(mn^2 + n (\log mC)^2)$ time for $n$ threads and $m$
servers with $C$ amount of resources each. We also give a faster algorithm with
the same approximation ratio and $O(n (\log mC)^2)$ time complexity. We then
extend the problem to two more general settings. First, we consider threads
with nonconcave utility functions, and give a 1/2 factor approximation
algorithm. Next, we give an algorithm for threads using multiple types of
resources, and show the algorithm achieves good empirical performance. We
conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of our algorithms on
threads with both synthetic and realistic utility functions, and find that they
achieve over 92\% of the optimal utility on average. We also compare our
algorithms with a number of practical heuristics, and find that our algorithms

paramagnetic phases at temperature $T^*$, which linearly increases with $q$.
Moreover, we show that for $q=3$ the phase transition is continuous and
discontinuous for larger values of $q$. For $q>3$ the hysteresis exhibits
oscillatory behavior -- expanding for even values of $q$ and shrinking for odd
values of $q$. If only simulation results were taken into account, this
phenomenon could be mistakenly interpreted as switching from discontinuous to
continuous phase transitions or even as evidence of the so-called mixed phase
transitions. Due to the mean-field like nature of the model we are able to
calculate analytically not only the stationary value of the order parameter but
also precisely determine the hysteresis and the effective potential showing
stable, unstable and metastable steady states. The main message is that in case
of non-equilibrium systems the hysteresis can behave in an odd way and computer
simulations alone may mistakenly lead to incorrect conclusions.

fluctuations in ferroelectric phase of ferroics with local disordering sources.
Within Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach we obtained analytical expressions
for the generalized susceptibility and phonon dispersion relations in the
ferroelectric phase. Unexpectedly, the joint action of static and dynamic
flexoelectric effect induces non-diagonal components of generalized
susceptibility, which amplitude is proportional to the convolution of the
spontaneous polarization with flexocoupling constants. The flexocoupling
essentially broaden the k-spectrum of generalized susceptibility and so
decreases the correlation radii, as well as leads to the additional ""pushing
away"" of the optical and acoustic soft mode phonon branches. The contribution
of spontaneous polarization via ferroelectric nonlinearity and electrostriction
mechanisms can lead to both broadening and narrowing on the susceptibility
k-spectrum. Due to the joint action of flexoelectric coupling and spontaneous
polarization the degeneration of the transverse optic and acoustic modes
disappears in the soft phonon spectrum in a ferroelectric phase in comparison
with the spectra in a paraelectric phase. These effects have been studied
quantitatively for ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate using realistic values
of static and dynamic flexocouplings and cubic symmetry approximation for the
elastic properties. Also we derived general expressions for correlation
function for arbitrary symmetry, elastic and electrostrictive anisotropy.

non-deterministically, although uniformly, in all possible worlds. We then
represent this within action model logic in order to give a sound and complete

well-suited laboratories for investigating the influence of magnetic fields on
the stellar surface because they produce abundance inhomogeneities (spots),
which results in photometric variability that is explained in terms of the
oblique rotator model. CP stars exhibiting this phenomenon are normally
classified as alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. It is important to
increase the sample of known rotational periods among CP stars by discovering
new ACV variables. The ASAS-3 data were cross-correlated with the Catalogue of
Ap, HgMn, and Am stars in order to analyse the light curves of bona fide CP and
related stars. The light curves were downloaded and cleaned of outliers and
data points with a flag indicating bad quality. Promising candidates showing a
larger scatter than observed for constant stars in the corresponding magnitude
range were searched for periodic signals using a standard Fourier technique. In
total, we found 323 variables, from which 246 are reported here for the first
time, and 77 were probably wrongly classified before. The observed variability
pattern of most stars is in accordance with an ACV classification. For some
cases, it is difficult to distinguish between the light curves of double-waved
ACVs and the variability induced by orbital motion (ellipsoidal
variables/eclipsing variables), especially for objects exhibiting very small
amplitudes and/or significant scatter in their light curves. Thus, some
eclipsing or rotating ellipsoidal variables might be present. However, we are
confident that the given periods are the correct ones. There seems to be a
possible weak correlation between the rotational period and colour, in the
sense that cooler magnetic CP stars rotate more slowly. However, this
correlation seems to disappear when correcting for the interstellar reddening.

The rates were obtained through the change of the total number of aggregates of

Simulation (ESS). Two different models were implemented in order to mimic the
dependence of the surface excess of the surfactant on the salt concentration.
Experimental measurements of kFC were also made, based on the change of the

between theory and experiment is only attained if the model of surfactant
adsorption accounts for the balance between the salting out of the surfactant
solution and the partial screening of the surface charge of the drops induced
by the increase of the ionic strength of the continuous phase. The observed
behavior cannot be justified on the grounds of the

also supports electronics. Here we report the first demonstration of
quantum-correlated photon pair generation in a device fabricated in an
unmodified advanced (sub-100nm) complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
process, alongside millions of working transistors. The microring resonator
photon pair source is formed in the transistor layer structure, with the
resonator core formed by the silicon layer typically used for the transistor
body. With ultra-low continuous-wave on-chip pump powers ranging from 5 $\mu$W

liquid phase, at low temperatures and high pressures, the quantum effects
become relevant. At extremely low temperature and pressure the first component
to show superfluidity is the helium in the vapor phase.

R^2\to\Bbb R^2$ given by two polynomials of two variables. Such a
transformation is called quadratic if the degrees of its polynomials are not
greater than two. In the present paper an exhaustive description of invertible
quadratic transformations of the real plane is given. Their application to the
perfect cuboid problem is discussed.

inviscid Euler equations for incompressible fluid flow, is solved exactly for
rotationally symmetric initial conditions. This exact solution shows that the
vortex strength for a pair of point vortices can either remain stable or blow
up in finite time, depending on the initial data.

Instead, we are in a new age where software is developed by a networked
community of individuals and organizations, which base their relations to each
other on mutual interest. Paradoxically, recent research suggests that software
development can actually be jointly-developed by rival firms. For instance, it
is known that the mobile-device makers Apple and Samsung kept collaborating in
open source projects while running expensive patent wars in the court. Taking a
case study approach, we explore how rival firms collaborate in the open source
arena by employing a multi-method approach that combines qualitative analysis
of archival data (QA) with mining software repositories (MSR) and Social
Network Analysis (SNA). While exploring collaborative processes within the
OpenStack ecosystem, our research contributes to Software Engineering research
by exploring the role of groups, sub-communities and business models within a
high-networked open source ecosystem. Surprising results point out that
competition for the same revenue model (i.e., operating conflicting business
models) does not necessary affect collaboration within the ecosystem. Moreover,
while detecting the different sub-communities of the OpenStack community, we
found out that the expected social tendency of developers to work with
developers from same firm (i.e., homophily) did not hold within the OpenStack
ecosystem. Furthermore, while addressing a novel, complex and unexplored open
source case, this research also contributes to the management literature in
coopetition strategy and high-tech entrepreneurship with a rich description on
how heterogeneous actors within a high-networked ecosystem (involving
individuals, startups, established firms and public organizations)
joint-develop a complex infrastructure for big-data in the open source arena.
