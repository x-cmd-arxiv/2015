are several potential applications for the proposed model, for example,
developing personalized marketing strategies and monitoring members' needs.
Furthermore, the results from the model can complement and can be integrated
with other existing models.
  The proposed model, named Dynamic Propensity Model, is a latent variable time
series model that utilizes both marketing and purchase histories of a customer.
The latent variable in the model represents the customer's propensity to buy a
product. The propensity derives from purchases and other observable responses.
Marketing touches increase a member's propensity, and propensity score
attenuates and propagates over time as governed by data-driven parameters. To
estimate the parameters of the model, a new statistical methodology has been
developed. This methodology makes use of particle methods with a stochastic
gradient descent approach, resulting in fast estimation of the model
coefficients even from big datasets. The model is validated using six months'
marketing records from one of the largest insurance companies in the U.S.
Experimental results indicate that the effects of marketing touches vary
depending on both channels and products. We compare the predictive performance
of the proposed model with lagged variable logistic regression. Limitations and
extensions of the proposed algorithm are also discussed.

to strengthening the position of the HPC community in an increasingly

extended here and applied to the Einstein equations of general relativity.
Specifically, we establish the nonlinear stability of Minkowski spacetime for
self-gravitating massive scalar fields, while existing methods only apply to
massless scalar fields. First of all, by analyzing the structure of the
Einstein equations in wave coordinates, we exhibit a nonlinear
wave-Klein-Gordon model defined on a curved background, which is the focus of
the present paper. For this model, we prove here the existence of
global-in-time solutions to the Cauchy problem, when the initial data have
sufficiently small Sobolev norms. A major difficulty comes from the fact that
the class of conformal Killing fields of Minkowski space is significantly
reduced in presence of a massive scalar field, since the scaling vector field
is not conformal Killing for the Klein-Gordon operator. Our method relies on
the foliation (of the interior of the light cone) of Minkowski spacetime by
hyperboloidal hypersurfaces and uses Lorentz-invariant energy norms. We
introduce a frame of vector fields adapted to the hyperboloidal foliation and
we establish several key properties: Sobolev and Hardy-type inequalities on
hyperboloids, as well as sup-norm estimates which correspond to the sharp time
decay for the wave and the Klein-Gordon equations. These estimates allow us to
control interaction terms associated with the curved geometry and the massive
field, by distinguishing between two levels of regularity and energy growth and
by a successive use of our key estimates in order to close a bootstrap
argument.

10^{23}\;{\rm WHz^{-1}}$. At these luminosities, both the star forming galaxies
and the cold mode AGN have hosts with stellar luminosities about a factor of
two lower than those of hot mode AGN, which continue to reside in only the most
massive hosts. We show that out to at least $z\sim 2$, galaxies with stellar

This is consistent with there being a sufficient number of radio sources that
radio-mode feedback could play a role in galaxy evolution.

encode diversity between the points of a given realization, through a positive
definite kernel $K$. DPPs possess desirable properties, such as exact sampling
or analyticity of the moments, but learning the parameters of kernel $K$
through likelihood-based inference is not straightforward. First, the kernel
that appears in the likelihood is not $K$, but another kernel $L$ related to
$K$ through an often intractable spectral decomposition. This issue is
typically bypassed in machine learning by directly parametrizing the kernel
$L$, at the price of some interpretability of the model parameters. We follow
this approach here. Second, the likelihood has an intractable normalizing
constant, which takes the form of a large determinant in the case of a DPP over
a finite set of objects, and the form of a Fredholm determinant in the case of
a DPP over a continuous domain. Our main contribution is to derive bounds on
the likelihood of a DPP, both for finite and continuous domains. Unlike
previous work, our bounds are cheap to evaluate since they do not rely on
approximating the spectrum of a large matrix or an operator. Through usual
arguments, these bounds thus yield cheap variational inference and moderately
expensive exact Markov chain Monte Carlo inference methods for DPPs.

online auctions in which we generally require optimizing an objective function
over the space of stopping rules for an allocation process under uncertainty.
Perhaps the most classic problems of stopping theory are the prophet inequality
problem and the secretary problem. The classical prophet inequality states that
by choosing the same threshold OPT/2 for every step, one can achieve the tight
competitive ratio of 0.5. On the other hand, for the basic secretary problem,
the optimal strategy achieves the tight competitive ratio of 1/e.
  In this paper, we introduce Prophet Secretary, a natural combination of the
prophet inequality and the secretary problems. An example motivation for our
problem is as follows. Consider a seller that has an item to sell on the market
to a set of arriving customers. The seller knows the types of customers that
may be interested in the item and he has a price distribution for each type:
the price offered by a customer of a type is anticipated to be drawn from the
corresponding distribution. However, the customers arrive in a random order.
Upon the arrival of a customer, the seller makes an irrevocable decision
whether to sell the item at the offered price. We address the question of
finding a strategy for selling the item at a high price.
  We show that by using a uniform threshold one cannot break the 0.5 barrier.
However, we show that i) using n distinct non-adaptive thresholds one can
obtain a competitive ratio that goes to (1-1/e) as n grows; and ii) no online
algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than 0.75. Our results improve
the (asymptotic) approximation guarantee of single-item sequential posted
pricing mechanisms from 0.5 to (1-1/e) when the order of agents (customers) is
chosen randomly.

it requires further investigation. For this purpose, we introduce a notion to
describe the degree of oscillation of an oscillatory function based on the

this new notion, we construct structured oscillatory spaces with oscillatory
structures. The structured spaces with a specific oscillatory structure can
capture the oscillatory components of the solutions of Fredholm integral
equations with oscillatory kernels. We then further propose oscillation
preserving Galerkin methods for solving the equations by incorporating the
standard approximation subspace of spline functions with a finite number of
oscillatory functions which capture the oscillation of the exact solutions of
the integral equations. We prove that the proposed methods have the optimal
convergence order uniformly with respect to the wavenumber and they are
numerically stable. A numerical example is presented to confirm the theoretical

intriguing spin-velocity locked conducting edge states and insulating
properties in the bulk. In the edge states, the electrons with opposite spins

recurrence free providing initial phase points in velocity space are set
randomly. Naturally, less filtering of fine-structures (arising from grid
spacing) is possible as there is now a smaller scale than the grid spacing that
is average distance between two phase points. Its interpolation scheme is very
simple in form and carried out with less operations. In our previous report,
the simplest model (immobile ions) was considered to merely demonstrate the
important features. Now, a hybrid model is introduced that solves the coupled
Vlasov-Fluid-Poisson system self-consistently. A possible application of the
code is the study of ion-acoustic (IA) soliton attributes. To this end, a
collisionless plasma with hot electrons and cold positive ions is considered.
For electrons, the collisionless Vlasov equation is solved by following
collisionless phase point trajectories in phase space while ions obey the fluid
equations. The periodic boundary conditions are assumed. Both, the
characteristic equations of the Vlasov equation and the fluid equations are
solved using the Leapfrog-Trapezoidal method. However, to obtain the first
half-time step of the Leapfrog, the Euler-Trapezoidal scheme, is employed. The
presented scheme conveniently couples the two well-known grids in the Leapfrog
method. The first test of the model is an stationary IA soliton. Trapping of
electrons is considered and the associated phase space hole is shown. Then as a
non-stationary test, the IA soliton generation from a localized initial profile
is examined. Conservation laws are the other benchmark tests.

Widefield Array (MWA) with the ionosphere as inferred from Global Positioning

position shift of the observed sources across an MWA field of view. These
effects can be computed from global ionosphere maps provided by GPS analysis
centres, namely the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE), using data
from globally distributed GPS receivers. However, for the more accurate local
ionosphere estimates required for precision radio astronomy applications, data
from local GPS networks needs to be incorporated into ionospheric modelling.
For GPS observations, the ionospheric parameters are biased by GPS receiver
instrument delays, among other effects, also known as receiver Differential
Code Biases (DCBs). The receiver DCBs need to be estimated for any non-CODE GPS
station used for ionosphere modelling, a requirement for establishing dense GPS
networks in arbitrary locations in the vicinity of the MWA. In this work,
single GPS station-based ionospheric modelling is performed at a time
resolution of 10 minutes. Also the receiver DCBs are estimated for selected
Geoscience Australia (GA) GPS receivers, located at Murchison Radio Observatory
(MRO1), Yarragadee (YAR3), Mount Magnet (MTMA) and Wiluna (WILU). The
ionospheric gradients estimated from GPS are compared with the ionospheric
gradients inferred from radio source position shifts observed with the MWA. The
ionospheric gradients at all the GPS stations show a correlation with the

energy. The studies of other authors are based on the use of input data from
atmospheric reanalysis or a downscaling of such reanalysis. Instead of
reanalysis data, we use input data from the operational limited area numerical
weather prediction model ALADIN. We showed that the estimations of the Black
Sea wave energy based on reanalyses deviate significantly from the real
potential. We showed also that the highest values of the mean annual wave power
flux is between 4.5 and 5.0 kW/m2 and the near shore areas with the highest
wave energy potential are the southernmost Bulgarian coast and the coast of
Turkey north of Istanbul. While we showed that the wind data from the
reanalysis are not useful for the estimation of the actual wave energy
potential, we claimed that the reanalysis data is useful to study the long term
changes of the wave energy of the Black Sea. We used the 10m winds from the
recent ERA-20C reanalysis, which covers the period 1901-2010. We performed a
110 years hindcast with these winds using the SWAN wave model. The results for
the area with the highest mean annual wave energy showed that there was an
increase during the first half of the XX century followed by a small decrease
and again a period with elevated wave energy during the seventies. After 1980
there is a steady decrease of the Black Sea wave energy.

generic Yukawa structure, we show that $|A_\Gamma^{f}|\lesssim \mathcal{O}

$A_{\Gamma}^f$ can be as large as $|A_{\Gamma}^f|\lesssim\mathcal{O} (10^{-5})$

limited by the availability of coherent sources at the required wavelength and
of appropriate power. This work investigates state-insensitive trapping of
caesium atoms for which the required wavelength of 935.6 nm is inconvenient in

proposed to overcome the lack of suitable laser sources. We first consider
pairs of laser wavelengths in the ratio 1:2 and 1:3, as obtained via second-

931.8-1863.6 nm and 927.5-2782.5 nm are suitable for state-insensitive trapping

form game has a Nash equilibrium, provided that players are allowed to use
randomized (mixed) strategies. However, in practice, humans are known to be bad
at generating random-like sequences, and true random bits may be unavailable.
Even if the players have access to enough random bits for a single instance of
the game their randomness might be insufficient if the game is played many
times.
  In this work, we ask whether randomness is necessary for equilibria to exist
in finitely repeated games. We show that for a large class of games containing
arbitrary two-player zero-sum games, approximate Nash equilibria of the
$n$-stage repeated version of the game exist if and only if both players have
$\Omega(n)$ random bits. In contrast, we show that there exists a class of
games for which no equilibrium exists in pure strategies, yet the $n$-stage
repeated version of the game has an exact Nash equilibrium in which each player
uses only a constant number of random bits.
  When the players are assumed to be computationally bounded, if cryptographic
pseudorandom generators (or, equivalently, one-way functions) exist, then the
players can base their strategies on ""random-like"" sequences derived from only
a small number of truly random bits. We show that, in contrast, in repeated
two-player zero-sum games, if pseudorandom generators \emph{do not} exist, then
$\Omega(n)$ random bits remain necessary for equilibria to exist.

superconductivity at low temperatures. Proposals in which the normal ground
state is characterised by small Fermi surface pockets that exist in the absence
of symmetry breaking have been superseded by models based on the existence of a
superlattice that breaks the translational symmetry of the underlying lattice.
Recently, a charge superlattice model that positions a small electron-like
Fermi pocket in the vicinity of the nodes (where the superconducting gap is
minimum) has been proposed a replacement for the prevalent superlattice models
that position the Fermi pocket in the vicinity of the pseudogap at the
antinodes (where the superconducting gap is maximum). Although some ingredients
of symmetry breaking have been recently revealed by crystallographic studies,

of research in computer science and mathematics, with many well-studied
constructions of infinite families of expanders. In some applications, though,
an infinite family is not enough: we need expanders which are ""close"" to each
other. We study the following question: Construct an an infinite sequence of
expanders $G_0,G_1,\dots$, such that for every two consecutive graphs $G_i$ and
$G_{i+1}$, $G_{i+1}$ can be obtained from $G_i$ by adding a single vertex and
inserting/removing a small number of edges, which we call the expansion cost of
transitioning from $G_i$ to $G_{i+1}$. This question is very natural, e.g., in
the context of datacenter networks, where the vertices represent racks of
servers, and the expansion cost captures the amount of rewiring needed when
adding another rack to the network. We present an explicit construction of
$d$-regular expanders with expansion cost at most $5d/2$, for any $d\geq 6$.
Our construction leverages the notion of a ""2-lift"" of a graph. This operation
was first analyzed by Bilu and Linial, who repeatedly applied 2-lifts to
construct an infinite family of expanders which double in size from one
expander to the next. Our construction can be viewed as a way to ""interpolate""
between Bilu-Linial expanders with low expansion cost while preserving good
edge expansion throughout.
  While our main motivation is centralized (datacenter networks), we also get
the best-known distributed expander construction in the ""self-healing"" model.

call parsimonious labeling. Specifically, our energy functional consists of
unary potentials and high-order clique potentials. While the unary potentials
are arbitrary, the clique potentials are proportional to the {\em diversity} of
set of the unique labels assigned to the clique. Intuitively, our energy
functional encourages the labeling to be parsimonious, that is, use as few
labels as possible. This in turn allows us to capture useful cues for important
computer vision applications such as stereo correspondence and image denoising.
Furthermore, we propose an efficient graph-cuts based algorithm for the
parsimonious labeling problem that provides strong theoretical guarantees on
the quality of the solution. Our algorithm consists of three steps. First, we
approximate a given diversity using a mixture of a novel hierarchical $P^n$
Potts model. Second, we use a divide-and-conquer approach for each mixture
component, where each subproblem is solved using an effficient
$\alpha$-expansion algorithm. This provides us with a small number of putative
labelings, one for each mixture component. Third, we choose the best putative
labeling in terms of the energy value. Using both sythetic and standard real
datasets, we show that our algorithm significantly outperforms other graph-cuts
based approaches.

  Fulk and Jain (Approximate inference and scientific method. Information and

  The subsequent study is dedicated to the question how these findings
generalise to the learning of r.e. languages from positive data. Here three

Following the line of Fulk and Jain's research, further investigations provide

inverse square-root dependence excellently (but using two free fitting
parameters for each dataset), it is also consistent with a dependence on the
simple inverse of grain size (with one free fitting parameter for each
dataset). There have been difficulties, recognised for half-a-century, in
explaining the inverse square-root expression. A Bayesian analysis shows that
the data strongly supports the simple inverse expression proposed. Since this
expression derives from underlying theory, it is also more readily explicable.
It is concluded that the Hall-Petch effect is not to be explained by the

persistent controversy between the various measurements and models in terms of
the wavelength dependence of the variation over the solar cycle, with
repercussions on our understanding of the influence of UV solar irradiance
variability on the stratosphere. We review the measurement and modelling of UV
solar irradiance variability over the period of satellite observation. The
SATIRE-S reconstruction is consistent with spectral solar irradiance
observations where they are reliable. It is also supported by an independent,
empirical reconstruction of UV spectral solar irradiance based on UARS/SUSIM
measurements from an earlier study. The weaker solar cycle variability produced
by NRLSSI between 300 and 400 nm is not evident in any available record. We
show that although the method employed to construct NRLSSI is principally

computational point of view, when a distance between cracks is small as
compared with their sizes, the system becomes ill-conditioned and numerical
results deteriorate. The physical consequence of the interaction consists in
decreasing of the crack opening and even greater decrease of conductivity. Then
the resistance to fluid flow grows what results in the propagation of only
those fractures, the distance between which is large enough.
  The research aims to suggests a means to overcome the computational
difficulty and to improve numerical simulation of hydraulic fractures in
shales. Numerical experiments are carried out for a 2D problem by using the
complex variable hypersingular boundary element method of higher order
accuracy. The condition number of the main matrix of a system, the opening of
cracks, the stress intensity factors, effective conductivity and resistance of
a cluster are calculated and analysed. The results imply that to avoid
computational instability, it is possible to replace a cluster of cracks by a
single properly located crack. The results also evidently confirm that the
propagation of distant individual fractures rather than of an array of closely

has a fermion doubling problem. To obtain this result, we couple loop quantum
gravity to a free massless scalar and a chiral fermion field, gauge fixing the
many fingered time gauge invariance by interpreting the scalar field as a
physical clock. We expand around a quantum gravity state based on a regular
lattice and consider the limit where the bare cosmological constant is large
but the fermonic excitations have energies low in Planck units. We then make
the case for identifying the energy spectrum in this approximation with that of
a model of lattice fermion theory which is known to double.

processes $\{X_n\}$ and $\{Y_n\}$ via the plug-in (or maximum-likelihood)
estimator is considered. When the joint process $\{(X_n,Y_n)\}$ is a Markov
chain of a given memory length, the plug-in estimator is shown to be
asymptotically Gaussian and to converge at the optimal rate $O(1/\sqrt{n})$
under appropriate conditions; this is the first estimator that has been shown
to achieve this rate. An important connection is drawn between the problem of
estimating the directed information rate and that of performing a hypothesis
test for the presence of causal influence between the two processes. Under
fairly general conditions, the null hypothesis, which corresponds to the
absence of causal influence, is equivalent to the requirement that the directed
information rate be equal to zero. In that case a finer result is established,
showing that the plug-in converges at the faster rate $O(1/n)$ and that it is
asymptotically $\chi^2$-distributed. This is proved by showing that this
estimator is equal to (a scalar multiple of) the classical likelihood ratio
statistic for the above hypothesis test. Finally it is noted that these results
facilitate the design of an actual likelihood ratio test for the presence or
absence of causal influence.

problem in cosmology or what we call cosmic logic. We describe a simple
computational model of cosmic logic suitable for analysis of, for example,
discretized cosmological systems. The construction is based on a particular
model of computation, developed by Alan Turing, with cosmic observers (CO),
cosmic measures (CM) and cosmic symmetries (CS) described by Turing machines.
CO machines always start with a blank tape and CM machines take CO's Turing
number (also known as description number or G{\"" o}del number) as input and
output the corresponding probability. Similarly, CS machines take CO's Turing
number as input, but output either one if the CO machines are in the same
equivalence class or zero otherwise. We argue that CS machines are more
fundamental than CM machines and, thus, should be used as building blocks in
constructing CM machines. We prove the non-computability of a CS machine which
discriminates between two classes of CO machines: mortal that halts in finite
time and immortal that runs forever. In context of eternal inflation this
result implies that it is impossible to construct CM machines to compute
probabilities on the set of all CO machines using cut-off prescriptions. The
cut-off measures can still be used if the set is reduced to include only
machines which halt after a finite and predetermined number of steps.

to building a winning team. To deal with such challenges, basketball managers,
scouts and coaches are increasingly turning to analytics. Objective evaluation
of players and teams has always been the top goal of basketball analytics.
Typical statistical analytics mainly focuses on the box score and has developed
various metrics. In spite of the more and more advanced methods, metrics built
upon box score statistics provide limited information about how players
interact with each other. Two players with similar box scores may deliver
distinct team plays. Thus professional basketball scouts have to watch real
games to evaluate players. Live scouting is effective, but suffers from
inefficiency and subjectivity. In this paper, we go beyond the static box score
and model basketball games as dynamic networks. The proposed Continuous-time
Stochastic Block Model clusters the players according to their playing style
and performance. The model provides cluster-specific estimates of the
effectiveness of players at scoring, rebounding, stealing, etc, and also
captures player interaction patterns within and between clusters. By clustering
similar players together, the model can help basketball scouts to narrow down
the search space. Moreover, the model is able to reveal the subtle differences
in the offensive strategies of different teams. An application to NBA
basketball games illustrates the performance of the model.

variables were mechanisms underlying SWB increase in subjects participating in
RMT group. Methods. A total of 273 subjects (54 males and 219 females, mean age
was 37.3(SD=10.5) years) were selected at random in nonclinical population and
assessed with the appropriate surveys and questionnaires. The RMT program was
proposed to the 105 subjects (24 males, 81 females, and mean age 37.6(SD=11.7)
years) with very low, low and medium SWB level. Control group was included.
Findings. Results revealed that: a) substantial changes in SWB and underlying
psychological state were observed among the participants as a result of RMT
intervention; b) RFSWB model predicts the changes in SWB after RMT intervention
satisfactorily and can help to identify the reliable predictors of success.

customers by providing relevant products is questionable. Here we introduce a
model to examine the benefit of recommender systems for users, and found that
recommendations from the system can be equivalent to random draws if one relies
too strongly on the system. Nevertheless, with sufficient information about
user preferences, recommendations become accurate and an abrupt transition to
this accurate regime is observed for some algorithms. On the other hand, we
found that a high accuracy evaluated by common accuracy metrics does not
necessarily correspond to a high real accuracy nor a benefit for users, which
serves as an alarm for operators and researchers of recommender systems. We
tested our model with a real dataset and observed similar behaviors. Finally, a
recommendation approach with improved accuracy is suggested. These results
imply that recommender systems can benefit users, but relying too strongly on
the system may render the system ineffective.
