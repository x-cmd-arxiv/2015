theory with linear inflaton potential in the Einstein frame. It follows that
all these quasi scale-invariant models have the same relation between the
tensor-to-scalar ratio and the scalar spectral index, which is also consistent
with the current data. Thus, they form a family of attractors, which is sharply
distinct from the recently discovered $\alpha$-attractors of Kallosh, Linde et

consists of a set system F over a finite universe U and an integer t; the
question is whether there is a set of t elements that intersects every set in
F. The Hitting Set problem parameterized by the size of the solution is a
well-known W[2]-complete problem in parameterized complexity theory. In this
paper we investigate the complexity of Hitting Set under various structural
parameterizations of the input. Our starting point is the folklore result that
Hitting Set is polynomial-time solvable if there is a tree T on vertex set U
such that the sets in F induce connected subtrees of T. We consider the case
that there is a treelike graph with vertex set U such that the sets in F induce
connected subgraphs; the parameter of the problem is a measure of how treelike
the graph is. Our main positive result is an algorithm that, given a graph G
with cyclomatic number k, a collection P of simple paths in G, and an integer
t, determines in time 2^{5k} (|G| +|P|)^O(1) whether there is a vertex set of
size t that hits all paths in P. It is based on a connection to the 2-SAT
problem in multiple valued logic. For other parameterizations we derive
W[1]-hardness and para-NP-completeness results.

sources for the appearance of a negative Casimir entropy. We show that the
dissipative contribution familiar from the plane-plane geometry appears also in
the plane-sphere and the sphere-sphere geometries and adds to the negative
Casimir entropy known to exist in these geometries even for perfectly
reflecting objects. Taking the sphere-sphere geometry as an example, we carry
out a scattering-channel analysis which allows to distinguish between the
contributions of different polarizations. We demonstrate that dissipation and
geometry share a common feature making possible negative values of the Casimir
entropy. In both cases there exists a scattering channel whose contribution to
the Casimir free energy vanishes in the high-temperature limit. While the
mode-mixing channel is associated with the geometric origin, the transverse
electric channel is associated with the dissipative origin of the negative
Casimir entropy. By going beyond the Rayleigh limit, we find even for large
distances that negative Casimir entropies can occur also for Drude-type metals
provided the dissipation strength is sufficiently small.

quickly as possible, the most profitable option from a set of options that
gives stochastic rewards. These decisions are made as dictated by each volume
of precipitated Ag atoms, which is moved in a manner similar to the
fluctuations of a rigid body in a tug-of-war game. The ""tug-of-war (TOW)

We show analytical calculations that validate the statistical reasons for the
ASDM dynamics to produce such high performance, despite its simplicity. These
results imply that various physical systems, in which some conservation law
holds, can be used to implement efficient ""decision-making objects."" Efficient
MAB solvers are useful for many practical applications, because MAB abstracts a
variety of decision-making problems in real- world situations where an
efficient trial-and-error is required. The proposed scheme will introduce a new

concern in many fields involving the management of risks stemming from multiple
sources, e.g. portfolio monitoring, insurance, environmental risk management
and anomaly detection. One convenient (non-parametric) characterization of
extremal dependence in the framework of multivariate Extreme Value Theory (EVT)
is the angular measure, which provides direct information about the probable
'directions' of extremes, that is, the relative contribution of each
feature/coordinate of the 'largest' observations. Modeling the angular measure
in high dimensional problems is a major challenge for the multivariate analysis
of rare events. The present paper proposes a novel methodology aiming at
exhibiting a sparsity pattern within the dependence structure of extremes. This
is done by estimating the amount of mass spread by the angular measure on
representative sets of directions, corresponding to specific sub-cones of
$R^d\_+$. This dimension reduction technique paves the way towards scaling up
existing multivariate EVT methods. Beyond a non-asymptotic study providing a
theoretical validity framework for our method, we propose as a direct
application a --first-- anomaly detection algorithm based on multivariate EVT.
This algorithm builds a sparse 'normal profile' of extreme behaviours, to be
confronted with new (possibly abnormal) extreme observations. Illustrative
experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our
approach.

whose bispectrum has an angle dependence between the three wavevectors that is
characterized by Legendre polynomials $\mathcal{P}_L$ and expansion
coefficients $c_L$. We provide forecasts for measurements of galaxy power
spectrum, finding that Large-Scale Structure (LSS) data could allow
measurements of primordial non-Gaussianity competitive or improving upon
current constraints set by CMB experiments, for all the shapes considered. We
argue that the best constraints will come from the possibility to assign
redshift information to radio galaxy surveys, and investigate a few possible
scenarios for the EMU and SKA surveys. A realistic (futuristic) modeling could
provide constraints of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} \approx 1 (0.5)$ for the local
shape, $f_{\rm NL}$ of $\mathcal{O}(10) (\mathcal{O}(1))$ for the orthogonal,
equilateral and folded shapes, and $c_{L=1} \approx 80 (2)$, $c_{L=2} \approx
400 (10)$ for angle-dependent non-Gaussianity. The more futuristic forecasts
show the potential of LSS analyses to considerably improve current constraints
on non-Gaussianity, and so on models of the primordial Universe. Finally, we
find the minimum requirements that would be needed to reach
$\sigma(c_{L=1})=10$, which can be considered as a typical (lower) value

It is now well known that a p-wave superconducting wire can sustain, in its
topological non-trivial phase, Majorana quasi-particles at its ends. Since this
type of superconductor is not found in nature, many methods have been devised
to implement it. Most of them rely on the spin-orbit interaction. In this paper
we study the superconducting properties of a two-band system in the presence of
antisymmetric hybridization. We consider inter-band attractive interactions and
also an attractive interaction in one of the bands. We show that
superconducting fluctuations with p-wave character are induced in the
non-interacting band due to the combined effects of inter-band coupling and
hybridization. In the case of a wire, this type of induced superconductivity
gives rise to four Majorana modes at its ends. The long range correlation
between the different charge states of these modes offers new possibilities for
the implementation of protected q-bits.

Four model- or machine learning-based photometric redshift methods -- ANNZ2,
BPZ calibrated against BCC-Ufig simulations, SkyNet, and TPZ -- are analysed.
For training, calibration, and testing of these methods, we construct a
catalogue of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies matched against DES SV data.
The performance of the methods is evaluated against the matched spectroscopic
catalogue, focusing on metrics relevant for weak lensing analyses, with
additional validation against COSMOS photo-zs. From the galaxies in the DES SV
shear catalogue, which have mean redshift $0.72\pm0.01$ over the range
$0.3<z<1.3$, we construct three tomographic bins with means of $z=\{0.45, 0.67,
1.00\}$. These bins each have systematic uncertainties $\delta z \lesssim 0.05$
in the mean of the fiducial SkyNet photo-z $n(z)$. We propagate the errors in
the redshift distributions through to their impact on cosmological parameters
estimated with cosmic shear, and find that they cause shifts in the value of
$\sigma_8$ of approx. 3%. This shift is within the one sigma statistical errors
on $\sigma_8$ for the DES SV shear catalog. We further study the potential
impact of systematic differences on the critical surface density,
$\Sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}$, finding levels of bias safely less than the
statistical power of DES SV data. We recommend a final Gaussian prior for the
photo-z bias in the mean of $n(z)$ of width $0.05$ for each of the three
tomographic bins, and show that this is a sufficient bias model for the
corresponding cosmology analysis.

shock. Here we present a robust detection of a time-resolved pre-transit, as
well as in-transit, absorption signature around the hot Jupiter exoplanet HD
189733b using high spectral resolution observations of several hydrogen Balmer
lines. The line shape of the pre-transit feature and the shape of the time
series absorption provide the strongest constraints on the morphology and
physical characteristics of extended structures around an exoplanet. The
in-transit measurements confirm the previous exospheric H-alpha detection
although the absorption depth measured here is ~50% lower. The pre-transit
absorption feature occurs 125 minutes before the predicted optical transit, a
projected linear distance from the planet to the stellar disk of 7.2 planetary
radii. The absorption strength observed in the Balmer lines indicates an
optically thick, but physically small, geometry. We model this signal as the
early ingress of a planetary bow shock. If the bow shock is mediated by a
planetary magnetosphere, the large standoff distance derived from the model
suggests a large equatorial planetary magnetic field strength of 28 G. Better
knowledge of exoplanet magnetic field strengths is crucial to understanding the
role these fields play in planetary evolution and the potential development of
life on planets in the habitable zone.

on such formula is sensitive to the manner in which the given pseudo-Boolean

encoding (GTE), which is an arc-consistency preserving extension of the
Totalizer encoding to pseudo-Boolean constraints. Unlike some other encodings,

MicroGrids (MGs), carried out without a dedicated modem, but by using power
electronics that interface the common bus. The information is transmitted by
modulating the parameters of the primary control, incurring subtle power
deviations that can be detected by other units. In this paper, we develop power
talk communication strategies for DC MG systems with arbitrary number of
control units that carry out all-to-all communication. We investigate two
multiple access strategies: 1) TDMA, where only one unit transmits at a time,
and 2) full duplex, where all units transmit and receive simultaneously. We
introduce the notions of signaling space, where the power talk symbol
constellations are constructed, and detection space, where the demodulation of
the symbols is performed. The proposed communication technique is challenged by
the random changes of the bus parameters due to load variations in the system.
To this end, we employ a solution based on training sequences, which
re-establishes the signaling and detection spaces and thus enables reliable
information exchange. The presented results show that power talk is an
effective solution for reliable communication among units in DC MG systems.

of 651 starless cores, ~60% of which are gravitationally bound prestellar
cores, and they will likely form stars in the future. We also detect 58
protostellar cores. The core mass function (CMF) derived for the prestellar
cores is very similar in shape to the stellar initial mass function (IMF),
supporting the earlier view that there is a close physical link between the IMF
and the CMF. The global shift in mass scale observed between the CMF and the
IMF is consistent with a typical star formation efficiency of ~40%. By
comparing the numbers of starless cores to the number of young stellar objects,
we estimate that the lifetime of prestellar cores is ~1 Myr. We find a strong
correlation between the spatial distribution of prestellar cores and the
densest filaments. About 90% of the Herschel-identified prestellar cores are
located above a background column density corresponding to A_V~7, and ~75% of
them lie within filamentary structures with supercritical masses per unit
length >~16 M_sun/pc. These findings support a picture wherein the cores making
up the peak of the CMF (and probably responsible for the base of the IMF)
result primarily from the gravitational fragmentation of marginally
supercritical filaments. Given that filaments appear to dominate the mass
budget of dense gas at A_V>7, our findings also suggest that the physics of
prestellar core formation within filaments is responsible for a characteristic
""efficiency"" SFR/M_dense ~5+-2 x 10^-8 yr^-1 for the star formation process in

whether $p$ belongs to some class of distributions $\mathcal{C}$ versus $p$
being far from every distribution in $\mathcal{C}$? This fundamental question
has received tremendous attention in statistics, focusing primarily on
asymptotic analysis, and more recently in information theory and theoretical
computer science, where the emphasis has been on small sample size and
computational complexity. Nevertheless, even for basic properties of
distributions such as monotonicity, log-concavity, unimodality, independence,
and monotone-hazard rate, the optimal sample complexity is unknown.
  We provide a general approach via which we obtain sample-optimal and
computationally efficient testers for all these distribution families. At the
core of our approach is an algorithm which solves the following problem: Given
samples from an unknown distribution $p$, and a known distribution $q$, are $p$
and $q$ close in $\chi^2$-distance, or far in total variation distance?
  The optimality of our testers is established by providing matching lower
bounds with respect to both $n$ and $\varepsilon$. Finally, a necessary
building block for our testers and an important byproduct of our work are the
first known computationally efficient proper learners for discrete log-concave

GeV by the Fermi LAT during the 4-year 3FGL catalog period partly because of an
instrumental selection effect, and partly due to their lower Doppler boosting
factors. Blazars with synchrotron peaks in their spectral energy distributions
located below $10^{13.4}$ Hz also tend to have high-energy peaks that lie below
the 0.1 GeV threshold of the LAT, and are thus less likely to be detected by
Fermi. The non-detected AGN in the 1.5 Jy sample also have significantly lower
15 GHz radio modulation indices and apparent jet speeds, indicating that they
have lower than average Doppler factors. Since the effective amount of
relativistic Doppler boosting is enhanced in gamma-rays (particularly in the
case of external inverse-Compton scattering), this makes them less likely to
appear in the 3FGL catalog. Based on their observed properties, we have
identified several bright radio-selected blazars that are strong candidates for
future detection by Fermi.

require that the dangerous couplings are forbidden at leading order, and when
re-generated by singlet vevs, lie within the experimental bounds. We scan over

to model and remove the pulsation signal from the light curves, isolating the

represented by a simple blackbody emission, without the need for more
sophisticated atmospheric models with temperature inversions. Although our data
cannot rule out models with or without a temperature inversion, they do confirm
a high brightness temperature for the planet at short wavelengths. WASP-33b is
one of the hottest exoplanets known till date, and its equilibrium temperature

M-theory, which are necessary to obtain a compactification with non-abelian
gauge symmetry or massless charged particles. This is more difficult than for
Calabi-Yau compactifications, due to the absence of calibrated two-cycles that
would have allowed for direct control of W-boson masses as a function of
moduli. Instead, we study the relationship between gauge enhancement and
singular limits in $G_2$ moduli space where an associative or coassociative
submanifold shrinks to zero size; this involves the physics of topological
defects and sometimes gives indirect control over particle masses, even though
they are not BPS. We show how a lemma of Joyce associates the class of a
three-cycle to any $U(1)$ gauge theory in a smooth $G_2$ compactification. If
there is an appropriate associative submanifold in this class then in the limit
of nonabelian gauge symmetry it may be interpreted as a gauge theory
worldvolume and provides the location of the singularities associated with
non-abelian gauge or matter fields. We identify a number of gauge enhancement
scenarios related to calibrated submanifolds, including Coulomb branches and
non-isolated conifolds, and also study examples that realize them.

extinctions on Earth. Due to the higher event rate of GRBs at higher redshifts,
it has been speculated that life as we know it may not survive above a certain
redshift (e.g. $z>0.5$). We examine the duty cycle of lethal (life-threatening)
GRBs in the solar neighborhood, in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies
and GRB host galaxies, with the dependence of the long GRB rate on star
formation and metallicity properly taken into account. We find that the number
of lethal GRBs attacking Earth within the past 500 Myr ($\sim$ epoch of the
Ordovician mass extinction) is $0.93$. The number of lethal GRBs hitting a
certain planet increases with redshift, thanks to the increasing star formation
rate and decreasing metallicity in high-$z$ galaxies. Taking 1 per 500 Myr as a
conservative duty cycle for life to survive, as evidenced by our existence, we
find that there are still a good fraction of SDSS galaxies beyond $z=0.5$ where
the GRB rate at half-mass radius is lower than this value. We derive the
fraction of such benign galaxies as a function of redshift through Monte Carlo
simulations, and find that the fraction is $\sim 50\%$ at $z\sim 1.5$ and $\sim
10\%$ even at $z \sim 3$. The mass distribution of benign galaxies is dominated
by Milky-Way-like ones, thanks to their commonness, relatively large mass, and
low star formation rate. GRB host galaxies are among the most dangerous ones.

Measurements of the ultra-violet (UV) are modelled within the context of

and stellar properties: the youngest and often most massive stars are the
strongest accretors, and there is an almost 1:1 relationship between the
accretion luminosity and stellar luminosity. Despite these overall trends of
increased accretion rates in HAeBes when compared to classical T Tauri stars,
we also find noticeable differences in correlations when considering the Herbig
Ae and Herbig Be subsets. This, combined with the difficulty in applying a
magnetospheric accretion model to some of the Herbig Be stars, could suggest
that another form of accretion may be occurring within the Herbig Be mass

far many details remain elusive about their rhythmic structures and how these

spontaneous cortical-subcortical networks, such as delta, spindle, gamma,
high-gamma and sharp wave ripple bands in different brain regions, are genuine
chaotic time series which can be reconstructed as chaotic attractors through
appropriately selected embedding delay and dimension. The reconstructed

precision short-term prediction. Simultaneously recorded oscillatory activities
in multiple brain regions differ greatly in term of temporal phase and

explore the possibility that positively skewed scale-dependent non-Gaussian

they produce more low-mass halos at high redshift, thus altering the production
of metals and ultra-violet flux, believed to be important factors in BH
formation. Additionally, a higher number of progenitors and of nearly
equal-mass halo mergers would boost the mass increase provided by BH-BH mergers
and merger-driven accretion. We use a set of two cosmological simulations, with
either Gaussian or scale-dependent non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations to
perform a proof-of-concept experiment to estimate how BH formation and growth
are altered. We estimate the BH number density and the fraction of halos where
BHs form, for both simulations and for two popular scenarios of BH formation
(remnants of the first generation of stars and direct collapse in the absence
of metals and molecular hydrogen). We find that the fractions of halos where
BHs form are almost identical, but that non-Gaussian primordial perturbations
increase the total number density of BHs for the both BH formation scenarios.

that non-Gaussianities increase both the BH masses and the number of the most

systems produced by radio AGN. We find high elemental abundances projected
preferentially along the cavities of 16 clusters. The metal-rich plasma was
apparently lifted out of the BCGs with the rising X-ray cavities (bubbles) to
altitudes between twenty and several hundred kiloparsecs. A relationship
between the maximum projected altitude of the uplifted gas (the ""iron radius"")
and jet power is found with the form $R_{\rm Fe} \propto P_{\rm jet}^{0.45}$.
The estimated outflow rates are typically tens of solar masses per year but
exceed $100 ~\rm M_\odot ~yr^{-1}$ in the most powerful AGN. The outflow rates
are 10% to 20% of the cooling rates, and thus alone are unable to offset a
cooling inflow. Nevertheless, hot outflows effectively redistribute the cooling
gas and may play a significant role at regulating star formation and AGN
activity in BCGs and presumably in giant elliptical galaxies. The metallicity
distribution overall can be complex, perhaps due to metal rich gas returning in
circulation flows or being blown around in the hot atmospheres. Roughly 15% of
the work done by the cavities is expended lifting the metal-enriched gas,
implying their nuclear black holes have increased in mass by at least $\sim
10^7$ M$_\odot$ to $10^9$ M$_\odot$. Finally, we show that hot outflows can
account for the broad, gas-phase metallicity distribution compared to the

scales, the shear maps from both surveys suffer from significant systematic
effects that prohibit a measurement of the shear power spectrum from either

cross-correlating the two surveys is unbiased.
  We measure an E-mode power spectrum from the data that is inconsistent with
zero signal at the 99\% confidence (~2.7{\sigma}) level. The odd-parity B-mode
signal and the EB cross- correlation are both found to be consistent with zero
(within 1{\sigma}). These constraints are obtained after a careful error
analysis that accounts for uncertainties due to cosmic variance, random galaxy
shape noise and shape measurement errors, as well as additional errors
associated with the observed large-scale systematic effects in the two surveys.
Our constraints are consistent with the expected signal in the concordance
cosmological model assuming recent estimates of the cosmological parameters
from the Planck satellite, and literature values for the median redshifts of
the SDSS and FIRST galaxy populations.

for the production of elliptical and early-type galaxies. In the process, the
system becomes an (ultra) luminous infrared galaxy, or (U)LIRG, that morphs to
a quasar, to a K+A galaxy, and finally to an early-type galaxy. The time scales
for this metamorphosis are only loosely constrained by observations. In
particular, the K+A phase should follow immediately after the QSO phase during
which the dust and gas remaining from the (U)LIRG phase are expelled by the
AGN. An intermediate class of QSOs with K+A spectral signatures, the
post-starburst QSOs or PSQ, may represent the transitional phase between QSOs
and K+As. We have compiled a sample of 72 {bona fide} $z<0.5$ PSQ from the SDSS
DR7 QSO catalogue. We find the intermediate age populations in this sample to
be on average significantly weaker and metal poorer than their putative
descendants, the K+A galaxies. The typical spectral energy distribution of PSQ
is well fitted by three components: starlight; an obscured power-law; and a hot
dust component required to reproduce the mid-IR fluxes. From the slope and
bolometric luminosity of the power-law component we estimate typical masses and
accretion rates of the AGN, but we find little evidence of powerful radio-loud
or strong X-ray emitters in our sample. This may indicate that the power-law
component originates in a nuclear starburst rather than in an AGN, as expected
if the bulk of their young stars are still being formed, or that the AGN is
still heavily enshrouded in dust and gas. We find that both alternatives are
problematic and that more and better optical, X-ray, and mm-wave observations
are needed to elucidate the evolutionary history of PSQ.

concept of a Laurent vertex is introduced and it is shown that the minimal
graded left ideals of L are generated by Laurent vertices and/or line points

complete characterization is obtained of the Leavitt path algebras over which
every graded irreducible representation is finitely presented. A useful result
is that the irreducible representation V_[p] induced by infinite path
tail-equivalent to an infinite path p is graded if and only if p is an
irrational infinite path. We also show that every one-sided ideal of L is
graded if and only if the graph E contains no cycles. Supplementing a theorem
of one of the co-authors that every Leavitt path algebra is graded von Neumann

2011. We find that in mid 2005, a year and a half after a giant flare (GF), the
torques on the star increased to the largest value yet seen, with a long term
average rate between 2005 and 2011 of
$\lvert\dot{\nu}\rvert\approx1.35\times10^{-11}$ Hz s$^{-1}$, an order of
magnitude larger than its historical level measured in 1995. The pulse
morphology of the source is complex in the observations following the GF, while
its pulsed-fraction remained constant at about $7\%$ in all observations.
Spectrally, the combination of a black-body (BB) and power-law (PL) components
is an excellent fit to all observations. The BB and PL fluxes increased by a
factor of 2.5 and 4, respectively, while the spectra hardened, in concordance
with the 2004 major outburst that preceded the GF. The fluxes decayed
exponentially back to quiescence with a characteristic time-scale of
$\tau\sim1.5$ yrs, although they did not reach a constant value until at least
3.5 years later (2009). The long-term timing and spectral behavior of the
source point to a decoupling between the mechanisms responsible for their
respective behavior. We argue that low level seismic activity causing small
twists in the open field lines can explain the long lasting large torques on
the star, while the spectral behavior is due to a twist imparted onto closed
field lines after the 2004 large outburst.

the required number of RF chains, by performing antenna selection. While this
approach is not a very effective strategy for theoretical independent Rayleigh
fading channels, a substantial reduction in the number of RF chains can be
achieved for real massive MIMO channels, without significant performance loss.
We evaluate antenna selection performance on measured channels at 2.6 GHz,
using a linear and a cylindrical array, both having 128 elements. Sum-rate
maximization is used as the criterion for antenna selection. A selection scheme
based on convex optimization is nearly optimal and used as a benchmark. The
achieved sum-rate is compared with that of a very simple scheme that selects
the antennas with the highest received power. The power-based scheme gives
performance close to the convex optimization scheme, for the measured channels.
This observation indicates a potential for significant reductions of massive

In certain real-world scenarios -like in the analysis of a disease propagating
through plants- the shape of the plots and fields where the host of the disease
is located may play a fundamental role on the propagation dynamics. Here we
consider a generalization of the RGG to account for the variation of the shape

analytical results we conclude that (ceteris paribus) the elongation of the
plot/field in which the nodes are distributed makes the network more resilient
to the propagation of a disease due to the fact that the epidemic threshold
increases with the elongation of the rectangle. These results agree with
accumulated empirical evidence and simulation results about the propagation of
diseases on plants in plots/fields of the same area and different shapes.

field from its large postinflationary value to the minimum of the effective

During this epoch, the time-dependent Higgs condensate can create an effective

Electroweak sphalerons redistribute this asymmetry between leptons and baryons.

\partial u(x,t)/\partial t = \kappa\Delta u(x,t) + \xi(x,t)u(x,t), x\in\Z^d,
t\geq 0, where \kappa \in [0,\infty) is the diffusion constant, \Delta is the
discrete Laplacian, and \xi is a dynamic random environment that drives the
equation. The initial condition u(x,0)=u_0(x), x\in\Z^d, is taken to be
non-negative and bounded. The solution of the parabolic Anderson equation
describes the evolution of a field of particles performing independent simple
random walks with binary branching: particles jump at rate 2d\kappa, split into
two at rate \xi \vee 0, and die at rate (-\xi) \vee 0. Our focus is on the
Lyapunov exponents \lambda_p(\kappa) = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{t} \log
\E([u(0,t)]^p)^{1/p}, p \in \N, and \lambda_0(\kappa) = \lim_{t\to\infty}
\frac{1}{t}\log u(0,t). We investigate what happens when \kappa\Delta is
replaced by \Delta^\cK, where \cK = \{\mathcal{K}(x,y)\colon\,x,y\in\Z^d,\,x
\sim y\} is a collection of random conductances between neighbouring sites
replacing the constant conductances \kappa in the homogeneous model. We show
that the associated annealed Lyapunov exponents are given by the formula
\lambda_p(\cK) = \sup\{\lambda_p(\kappa) \colon\,\kappa\in\Supp(\cK)\}, where
\Supp(\cK) is the set of values taken by the \cK-field. We also show that for
the associated quenched Lyapunov exponent this formula only provides a lower
bound. Our proof is valid for three classes of reversible \xi, and for all \cK
satisfying a certain clustering property, namely, there are arbitrarily large
balls where \cK is almost constant and close to any value in \Supp(\cK). What
our result says is that the Lyapunov exponents are controlled by those pockets
of \cK where the conductances are close to the value that maximises the growth
in the homogeneous setting.

transportation systems using GPS data from taxis. The granularity of the GPS
data necessary for this analysis is relatively coarse; it only requires
coordinates for the beginning and end of trips, the metered distance, and the
total travel time. The method works by computing the historical distribution of
pace (normalized travel times) between various regions of a city and measuring
the pace deviations during an unusual event. This method is applied to a
dataset of nearly 700 million taxi trips in New York City, which is used to
analyze the transportation infrastructure resilience to Hurricane Sandy. The
analysis indicates that Hurricane Sandy impacted traffic conditions for more
than five days, and caused a peak delay of two minutes per mile. Practically,
it identifies that the evacuation caused only minor disruptions, but
significant delays were encountered during the post-disaster reentry process.
Since the implementation of this method is very efficient, it could potentially
be used as an online monitoring tool, representing a first step toward
quantifying city scale resilience with coarse GPS data.

luminosity for a 1.4 Msol compact object, poses a challenge for accretion
physics. In order to better understand the nature of this source and its duty
cycle, and in the light of several physical models that have been subsequently
published, we conduct a spectral and temporal analysis of the 0.5-8 keV X-ray
emission from this source from 15 years of Chandra observations. We fit the
Chandra spectra of the pulsar with a power-law model and a disk black body
model, subjected to interstellar absorption in M82. We carefully assess for the
effect of pile-up in our observations, where 4/19 observations have a pile-up
fraction >10%, which we account for during spectral modeling with a convolution
model. When fitted with a power-law model, the average photon index when the
source is at high luminosity (L_X>10^39 ergs s^-1) is Gamma=1.33+/-0.15. For
the disk black body model, the average temperature is T=3.24+/-0.65 keV,
consistent with other luminous X-ray pulsars. We also investigated the
inclusion of a soft excess component and spectral break, finding that the
spectra are also consistent with these features common to luminous X-ray
pulsars. In addition, we present spectral analysis from NuSTAR over the 3-50
keV range where we have isolated the pulsed component. We find that the pulsed
emission in this band is best fit by a power-law with a high-energy cut-off,

been identified as a transient, we find from our longer-baseline study that it
has been remarkably active over the 15-year period, where for 9/19 (47%)

depends on input parameters estimated from finite real-world data, and the
finiteness of data brings input uncertainty into the system. The quantification
of the impact of input uncertainty on output response has been extensively
studied. Most of the existing literature focuses on providing inferences on the
mean response at the true but unknown input parameter, including point
estimation and confidence interval construction. Risk quantification of mean
response under input uncertainty often plays an important role in system
evaluation and control, because it provides inferences on extreme scenarios of
mean response in all possible input models. To the best of our knowledge, it
has rarely been systematically studied in the literature. In this paper, first
we introduce risk measures of mean response under input uncertainty, and
propose a nested Monte Carlo simulation approach to estimate them. Then we
develop asymptotical properties such as consistency and asymptotic normality
for the proposed nested risk estimators. We further study the associated budget
allocation problem for efficient nested risk simulation, and finally use a

other $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ bidoublet axial vector boson $a$ would cancel
all deviations of electroweak obervables induced by $\rho$ even if the SM
fermions mix with some heavy vector like (composite) fermions which couple to
$\rho$ (""non-universally partially composite""), therefore allows arbitrary
couplings between each SM fermion and $\rho$. We present our model in the
""General Composite Higgs"" framework with $SO(5) \times U(1)_X \rightarrow SO(4)

positive gauge boson form factors as the theoretical constraints. We find that
our model can fit the diboson excess very well if the left-handed SM light
quarks, charged leptons and tops have zero, zero/moderately small and
moderate/large composite components for reasonable values of $g_\rho$ and $f$.
The correlation between tree level $S$ parameter and the $h \rightarrow Z

indeed a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ effect in our parameter space which provides a strong

described. The basic equations are ion and electron fluid equations and the
Maxwell equations without displacement current. The neglect of displacement
current is consistent with the assumption of charge neutrality. It thus reduces
to the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the long wavelength limit,
but the two-fluid effect appearing at ion and electron inertial scales is fully
taken into account. It is shown that the basic equations may be rewritten in a
form that has formally the same structure as the MHD equations. The total mass,
momentum, and energy are all written in the conservative form. A new
three-dimensional numerical simulation code has been developed for the QNTF
equations. The HLL (Harten-Lax-van Leer) approximate Riemann solver combined
with the upwind constrained transport (UCT) scheme is applied. The method was
originally developed for MHD (Londrillo & Del Zanna, 2004), but works quite
well for the present model as well. The simulation code is able to capture
sharp multidimensional discontinuities as well as dispersive waves arising from
the two-fluid effect at small scales without producing $\nabla \cdot
\mathbf{B}$ errors. It is well known that conventional Hall-MHD codes often
suffer a numerical stability issue associated with short wavelength whistler
waves. On the other hand, since finite electron inertia introduces an upper
bound to the phase speed of whistler waves in the present model, our code is
free from the issue even without explicit dissipation terms or implicit time
integration. Numerical experiments have confirmed that there is no need to
resolve characteristic time scales such as plasma frequency or cyclotron
frequency for numerical stability. Consequently, the QNTF model offers a better
alternative to the Hall-MHD or fully electromagnetic two-fluid models.

function is its sensitivity to the used data sets quality. This limitation is
due to the existence of noisy, silence or redundant data. This paper proposes a
novel consensus function of cluster ensembles based on Multilayer networks
technique and a maintenance database method. This maintenance database approach
is used in order to handle any given noisy speech and, thus, to guarantee the

a crucial role in post-Moore era. Besides applications on electronic devices,
graphene has shown great potential for nano-electromechanical systems. While
interlayer interactions play a key role in modifying the electronic structures
of layered materials, no attention has been given to their impact on
electromechanical properties. Here we report the positive piezoconductive
effect observed in suspended bi- and multi-layer graphene. The effect is highly
layer number dependent and shows the most pronounced response for tri-layer
graphene. The effect, and its dependence on the layer number, can be understood
as resulting from the strain-induced competition between interlayer coupling
and intralayer transport, as confirmed by the numerical calculations based on
the non-equilibrium Green's function method. Our results enrich the
understanding of graphene and point to layer number as a powerful tool for
tuning the electromechanical properties of graphene for future applications.

Specifically, we use a scaled-up model to study the motion of suspended

possible depending on the orientation of the driving acceleration with respect
to the array of posts (forcing angle). We focus on the fractionation of binary
suspensions and measure the separation resolution at the outlet of the device
for different forcing angles. We found excellent resolution at intermediate
forcing angles, when large particles are locked to move at small migration
angles but smaller particles follow the forcing angle more closely. Finally, we
show that reducing the initial concentration (number) of particles, approaching
the dilute limit of single particles, leads to increased resolution in the

to the binding energies per Li atom increase with the increasing number of

band gap is enlarged with the increasing number of intercalated Li atoms, up to
160 meV with nine Li; hence these results suggest an efficient way to tune the

Jlow<90. About 30 per cent of these lines are unblended or weakly blended and
can be partially or entirely fitted with a code developed to model the mid-IR
emission of a spherically symmetric circumstellar envelope composed of
expanding gas and dust. The observed lines trace the envelope at distances to
the star <35R* (~0.7 arcsec). The fits are compatible with an expansion
velocity of 1+2.5(r/R*-1) km/s between 1 and 5R*, 11 km/s between 5 and 20R*,
and 14.5 km/s outwards. The derived abundance profile of 28Si32S with respect
to H2 is 4.9e-6 between the stellar photosphere and 5R*, decreasing linearly to
1.6e-6 at 20R* and to 1.3e-6 at 50R*. 28Si32S seems to be rotationally under
LTE in the region of the envelope probed with our observations and
vibrationally out of LTE in most of it. There is a red-shifted emission excess
in the 28Si32S lines of band v=1-0 that cannot be found in the lines of bands

Gor'kov equations. Here $M$ is the internal degrees of freedom in the bands
crossing the Fermi energy and $N$ is the degree of freedom in a model. Our
framework naturally includes inter-band off-diagonal elements of Green's

equations are similar to the single-band ones, except for multi-band effects.
The multi-band effects can exhibit the non-locality and the anisotropy in the
mapped systems. Our framework can be applied to an arbitrary Hamiltonian (e.g.
a tight-binding Hamiltonian derived by the first-principle calculation). As
examples, we use our framework in various kinds of systems, such as

fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems coupling incompressible flows with
thin elastic structures undergoing finite deformations. The new AMP scheme is
fully second-order accurate and stable, without sub-time-step iterations, even
for very light structures when added-mass effects are strong. The fluid,
governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, is solved in
velocity-pressure form using a fractional-step method; large deformations are
treated with a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian approach on deforming composite grids.
The motion of the thin structure is governed by a generalized Euler-Bernoulli
beam model, and these equations are solved in a Lagrangian frame using two
approaches, one based on finite differences and the other on finite elements.
Special treatment of the AMP condition is required to couple the finite-element
beam solver with the finite-difference-based fluid solver, and two coupling
approaches are described. A normal-mode stability analysis is performed for a
linearized model problem involving a beam separating two fluid domains, and it
is shown that the AMP scheme is stable independent of the ratio of the mass of
the fluid to that of the structure. A traditional partitioned (TP) scheme using
a Dirichlet-Neumann coupling for the same model problem is shown to be
unconditionally unstable if the added mass of the fluid is too large. A series
of benchmark problems of increasing complexity are considered to illustrate the
behavior of the AMP algorithm, and to compare the behavior with that of the TP
scheme. The results of all these benchmark problems verify the stability and
accuracy of the AMP scheme. Results for one benchmark problem modeling blood
flow in a deforming artery are also compared with corresponding results

The first algorithm presented, DMaxWalkSat, is a constraint solver specialized
for solving dynamic, weighted constraint satisfaction problems. The second
algorithm, RDMaxWalkSat, is a derivative of DMaxWalkSat that has been modified
into an anytime algorithm, and hence support realtime constraint satisfaction.
DMaxWalkSat is shown to offer performance advantages in terms of solution
quality and runtime over its parent constraint solver, MaxWalkSat. RDMaxWalkSat
is shown to support anytime operation. The introduction of these algorithms
brings another tool to the areas of computer science that naturally represent
problems as constraint satisfaction problems, an example of which is the robust
coherence algorithm.

  While the energy scale of such strongly Lorentz symmetry-violating physics is

expect tests of LLI violating physics in the electron-photon sector to reach
levels of $10^{-23}$, five orders of magnitude more sensitive than the current

of the localization of the d orbitals of Ca pseudopotential has been included.
The Hubbard U corrected d-orbital for Ca sites are playing a role assisting the
charge transfer from p orbitals of S site to the Ca site, giving both localized
electron and hole states within the band gap, with an energy interval of
1.2~1.4 eV. This corresponds to the localized excitonic levels below the
conduction band edge for the optical absorption. The electronic properties and
formation energies of native point defects have been discussed. We found the
neutral S vacancy has the lowest energy of 0.62 eV under Ca-rich limit. The
Schottky defect pair defect is another dominant defect with cost of 1.51 eV per
defect site from S-rich to Ca-rich chemical potential limits. The defect
formation energy further summarized that the doubly positive S vacancy and
doubly negative Ca vacancy are both the most stable donor-type and
acceptor-type defects respectively coexisting in CaS. We also summarized a
narrow doping limit energy which has been determined as 1.33 eV constantly in
CaS independent to different chemical potential limits. But such doping allowed
range entirely shifts from valence band vicinity toward the conduction band
edge from S-rich to Ca-rich limits. Under S-rich limit, the dopable range for
EF shifting corresponds to Eu2+ doping experiments, the luminescence wavelength
limit is predicted to be 659 nm (1.88 eV) remarkably close to the reported
results 650 nm. This gives a solid theoretical reference for the lanthanide
ions doping experiments in CaS. We conclude that the defect levels combined
with formation energy is an accessible way to suggest the doping energy range
and an assistant to explain the activation stage of photostimulated
luminescence (PSL) mechanism in lanthanide ions doped crystal materials.

approaches for parameterising these models with experimental data. The process
of building a Markov model that integrates various sources of experimental data
is illustrated using two recent examples, the model by Ullah et al. and the
""Park-Drive"" model by Siekmann et al., the only models that account for all
sources of data currently available. Finally, it is demonstrated that the
essential features of the Park-Drive model in different models of calcium
dynamics are preserved after reducing it to a two-state model that only
accounts for the switching between the inactive ""park"" and the active ""drive""
mode. This highlights the fact that modal gating is the most important
mechanism of ligand regulation in the IPR. It also emphasises that data-driven
models of ion channels do not necessarily have to lead to detailed models but
can be constructed so that relevant data is selected to represent ion channels
at the appropriate level of complexity for a given application.

shown that quark matter may exist at the extreme densities in the cores of
high-mass neutron stars. It has also been shown that a phase transition from
hadronic matter to quark matter would result in an extended mixed phase region
that would segregate phases by net charge to minimize the total energy of the
phase, leading to the formation of a crystalline lattice. The existence of
quark matter in the core of a neutron star may have significant consequences
for its thermal evolution, which for thousands of years is facilitated
primarily by neutrino emission. In this work we investigate the effect a
crystalline quark-hadron mixed phase can have on the neutrino emissivity from
the core. To this end we calculate the equation of state using the relativistic
mean-field approximation to model hadronic matter and a nonlocal extension of
the three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for quark matter. Next we determine
the extent of the quark-hadron mixed phase and its crystalline structure using
the Glendenning construction, allowing for the formation of spherical blob,
rod, and slab rare phase geometries. Finally we calculate the neutrino
emissivity due to electron-lattice interactions utilizing the formalism
developed for the analogous process in neutron star crusts. We find that the
contribution to the neutrino emissivity due to the presence of a crystalline
quark-hadron mixed phase is substantial compared to other mechanisms at fairly
low temperatures ($\lesssim 10^9$ K) and quark fractions ($\lesssim 30\%$), and
that contributions due to lattice vibrations are insignificant compared to
static-lattice contributions.

computationally expensive features, such as segment neural networks or other

by beam pruning in a single pass or by beam pruning to generate a lattice

that beam search is not suitable for learning rescoring models in this

germanium, host extremely mobile carriers, which give rise to quantum
oscillations detectable in relatively low magnetic fields. The small Fermi
energy in these dilute metals quantifies the depth of the Fermi sea. When the
carrier density exceeds a threshold, accessible thanks to the long Bohr radius
of the parent insulator, the local seafloor is carved by distant dopants. In
such conditions, with a random distribution of dopants, the probability of
finding an island or a trench depends on on the effective Bohr radius,
a$_{B}^{*}$ and the carrier density, n. This picture yields an expression for
electron mobility with a random distribution of dopants: $\mu_{RD}\propto
$(a$_{B}^{*})^{1/2}$ n$^{-5/6}$, in reasonable agreement with the magnitude and
concentration dependence of the low-temperature mobility in three dilute metals
whose insulating parents are a wide-gap (SrTiO$_{3}$), a narrow-gap (PbTe) and

Galactic CRs are accelerated in SNR shocks is the maximum energy at which

to the knee. Here we discuss the non-resonant version of this instability
which, with its faster growth and larger value of the amplified field,
increases the achievable maximum energy. Because of their higher explosion
rate, we focus on type II SNe expanding in their red supergiant wind and we
find that the transition between Ejecta Dominated (ED) and Sedov-Taylor (ST)
phases takes place at very early times. In this environment, the accelerated
particle spectrum shows no high energy exponential cut-off but a spectral break
at the maximum energy (EM). Moreover, the maximum energy of protons can easily
reach PeV energies. With this model, we tried to fit KASCADE Grande and ARGO

criticality. Experimentally, quantum critical points have been identified and
studied in a growing list of heavy fermion compounds. Theoretically, Kondo
destruction has provided a means to characterize a class of unconventional
quantum critical points that goes beyond the Landau framework of
order-parameter fluctuations. Among the prominent evidence for such local
quantum criticality have been measurements in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. A rapid crossover
is observed at finite temperatures in the isothermal field dependence of the
Hall coefficient and other transport and thermodynamic quantities, which
specifies a $T^*(B)$ line in the temperature ($T$)-magnetic field ($B$) phase
diagram. Here, we discuss what happens when temperature is raised, by analyzing
the ratio of the crossover width to the crossover position. With this ratio
approaching unity at $T \gtrsim 0.5$ K, YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ at zero magnetic field
belongs to the quantum-critical fluctuation regime, where the single-particle
spectral function has significant spectral weight at both the small and large
Fermi surfaces. This implies that, in this temperature range, any measurements
sensitive to the Fermi surface will also see a significant spectral weight at
the large Fermi surface. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
experiments recently reported for YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ at $T>1$ K are consistent with
this expectation, and therefore support the association of the $T^*(B)$ line
with the physics of Kondo destruction.

checking for regressions. However, there are two issues that may be the
barriers for its powerfulness. First, the bias term in its liming null
distribution causes the test not to well control type I error and thus Monte
Carlo approximation for critical value determination is required. Second, it
severely suffers from the curse of dimensionality due to the use of
multivariate nonparametric function estimation. The purpose of this paper is
thus two-fold: a bias-correction is suggested to this test and a dimension
reduction-based model-adaptive enhancement is recommended to promote the power
performance. The proposed test still possesses the Wilks phenomenon, and the
test statistic can converge to its limit at a much faster rate and is much more
sensitive to alternative models than the original nonparametric generalized
likelihood ratio test as if the dimension of covariates were one. Simulation
studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance and to compare

merit-order dispatch in electricity markets with uncertain supply. For this, we
consider a power system whose operation is driven by a two-stage electricity
market, with a forward and a real-time market. We analyze two different
clearing mechanisms: a conventional one, whereby the forward and the balancing
markets are independently cleared following a merit order, and a stochastic
one, whereby both market stages are co-optimized with a view to minimizing the
expected aggregate system operating cost. We first derive analytical formulae
to determine the dispatch rule prompted by the co-optimized two-stage market
for a stylized power system with flexible, inflexible and stochastic power
generation and infinite transmission capacity. This exercise sheds light on the
conditions for the stochastic market-clearing mechanism to break the merit
order. We then introduce and characterize two enhanced variants of the
conventional two-stage market that result in either price-consistent or
cost-efficient merit-order dispatch solutions, respectively. The first of these
variants corresponds to a conventional two-stage market that allows for virtual
bidding, while the second requires that the stochastic power production be
centrally dispatched. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of our
analytical results and illustrate our conclusions through examples.

captures the emergence of system-level dynamics close to the onset of socially
relevant collective phenomena. The framework is validated against a detailed
empirical analysis of five case studies. In particular, we identify a change in
the characteristic time-scale of the information transfer that flags the onset
of information-driven collective phenomena. Furthermore, our approach
identifies an order-disorder transition in the directed network of influence
between social sub-units. In the absence of a clear exogenous driving, social
collective phenomena can be represented as endogenously-driven structural
transitions of the information transfer network. This study provides results
that can help define models and predictive algorithms for the analysis of
societal events based on open source data.

With the input-output process of photons, two-photon polarization-spatial
hyperentangled Bell states can be generated in a deterministic way and their
complete nondestructive analysis can be achieved. These schemes can be
generalized to generate and analyze hyperentangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
states of multi-photon systems as well. Compared with previous works, these two
schemes relax the difficulty of their implementation in experiment as it is not
difficult to obtain the $\pi$ phase shift in single-sided NV-cavity systems.
Moreover, our schemes do not require that the transmission for the uncoupled
cavity is balanceable with the reflectance for the coupled cavity. Our
calculations show that these schemes can reach a high fidelity and efficiency
with current technology, which may be a benefit to long-distance high-capacity
quantum communication with two DOFs of photon systems.

requirement of a likelihood evaluation for the full data set in each iteration.
Payne and Mallick (2015) propose to speed up the algorithm by a delayed
acceptance approach where the acceptance decision proceeds in two stages. In
the first stage, an estimate of the likelihood based on a random subsample
determines if it is likely that the draw will be accepted and, if so, the
second stage uses the full data likelihood to decide upon final acceptance.
Evaluating the full data likelihood is thus avoided for draws that are unlikely
to be accepted. We propose a more precise likelihood estimator which
incorporates auxiliary information about the full data likelihood while only
operating on a sparse set of the data. We prove that the resulting delayed
acceptance MH is more efficient compared to that of Payne and Mallick (2015).
The caveat of this approach is that the full data set needs to be evaluated in
the second stage. We therefore propose to substitute this evaluation by an
estimate and construct a state-dependent approximation thereof to use in the
first stage. This results in an algorithm that (i) can use a smaller subsample
m by leveraging on recent advances in Pseudo-Marginal MH (PMMH) and (ii) is
provably within $O(m^{-2})$ of the true posterior.

fundamental properties (formulated for covectors) together lead to the natural
notion of ""conditional oriented matroid"" (abbreviated COM). These novel

generalizing the familiar characterization for oriented matroids. We describe a
binary composition scheme by which every COM can successively be erected as a
certain complex of oriented matroids, in essentially the same way as a lopsided

represented by a hyperplane arrangement restricted to an open convex set. Among
these are the examples formed by linear extensions of ordered sets,
generalizing the oriented matroids corresponding to the permutohedra. Relaxing

estimating dynamic discrete choice models. The method, which can accommodate
lagged dependent variables, serially correlated errors, unobserved variables,
and many alternatives, builds on the ideas of indirect inference. The main
difficulty in implementing indirect inference in discrete choice models is that
the objective surface is a step function, rendering gradient-based optimization
methods useless. To overcome this obstacle, this paper shows how to smooth the
objective surface. The key idea is to use a smoothed function of the latent
utilities as the dependent variable in the auxiliary model. As the smoothing
parameter goes to zero, this function delivers the discrete choice implied by
the latent utilities, thereby guaranteeing consistency. We establish conditions
on the smoothing such that our estimator enjoys the same limiting distribution
as the indirect inference estimator, while at the same time ensuring that the
smoothing facilitates the convergence of gradient-based optimization methods. A
set of Monte Carlo experiments shows that the method is fast, robust, and
nearly as efficient as maximum likelihood when the auxiliary model is
sufficiently rich.

the Majorana mode decays exponentially fast. By the inclusion of strong
disorder, where the closed system enters a many-body localized phase, we find
that the Majorana mode can be stabilized substantially. The decay of the
Majorana converts into a stretched exponential form for particle losses or
gains occuring in the bulk. In particular, for pure loss dynamics we find a
universal exponent $\alpha \simeq 2/3$. We show that this holds both in the

to stabilize edge states even in the presence of symmetry-breaking

evanescent operators and fields modify the leading ultraviolet divergence in
pure gravity. To analyze the divergence, we compute the two-loop
identical-helicity four-graviton amplitude and determine the coefficient of the
associated (non-evanescent) R^3 counterterm studied long ago by Goroff and
Sagnotti. We compare two pairs of theories that are dual in D=4: gravity
coupled to nothing or to three-form matter, and gravity coupled to zero-form or
to two-form matter. Duff and van Nieuwenhuizen showed that, curiously, the
one-loop conformal anomaly --- the coefficient of the Gauss-Bonnet operator ---
changes under p-form duality transformations. We concur, and also find that the
leading R^3 divergence changes under duality transformations. Nevertheless, in

the pressure tensor, and of the heat current in a fluid maintained in a
non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) with a fixed temperature gradient, a
system where the non-equilibrium correlations are especially long ranged. For
this particular NESS our results show that (1) The mean-squared fluctuations in
non-equilibrium differ markedly in their system size scaling compared to their
equilibrium counterparts and (2) There are large, nonlocal, correlations of the
normal stress in this NESS. These terms provide important corrections to the
fluctuating normal stress in linearized Landau-Lifshitz fluctuating
hydrodynamics.

satellites. In fact, contrary to their central (most massive) galaxy of a
group/cluster, satellite galaxies are stripped of their gas and stars, and have
their star formation quenched by their environment. Large galaxy surveys like
SDSS now permit us to investigate in detail environment-driven transformation
processes by comparing centrals and satellites. In this paper I summarize what

prevalence of high-dimensional streaming data, there are relatively few
algorithms for dynamic filtering of time-varying sparse signals. Of the
existing algorithms, fewer still provide strong performance guarantees. This
paper examines two algorithms for dynamic filtering of sparse signals that are
based on efficient l1 optimization methods. We first present an analysis for
one simple algorithm (BPDN-DF) that works well when the system dynamics are
known exactly. We then introduce a novel second algorithm (RWL1-DF) that is
more computationally complex than BPDN-DF but performs better in practice,
especially in the case where the system dynamics model is inaccurate.
Robustness to model inaccuracy is achieved by using a hierarchical
probabilistic data model and propagating higher-order statistics from the
previous estimate (akin to Kalman filtering) in the sparse inference process.
We demonstrate the properties of these algorithms on both simulated data as
well as natural video sequences. Taken together, the algorithms presented in
this paper represent the first strong performance analysis of dynamic filtering
algorithms for time-varying sparse signals as well as state-of-the-art
performance in this emerging application.

Instead of removing individual weights one at a time as done in previous works,
we remove one neuron at a time. We show how similar neurons are redundant, and

effect of non-zero spin leaving an indelible imprint on the space-time closest

orbits are affected both in terms of stability and precession, which impacts on

down-up). The study of alternating words avoiding classical permutation
patterns was initiated by the authors in~\cite{GKZ}, where, in particular, it
was shown that 123-avoiding up-down words of even length are counted by the
Narayana numbers.
  However, not much was understood on the structure of 123-avoiding up-down
words. In this paper, we fill in this gap by introducing the notion of a
cut-pair that allows us to subdivide the set of words in question into
equivalence classes. We provide a combinatorial argument to show that the
number of equivalence classes is given by the Catalan numbers, which induces an
alternative (combinatorial) proof of the corresponding result in~\cite{GKZ}.
  Further, we extend the enumerative results in~\cite{GKZ} to the case of
alternating words avoiding a vincular pattern of length 3. We show that it is
sufficient to enumerate up-down words of even length avoiding the consecutive
pattern $\underline{132}$ and up-down words of odd length avoiding the
consecutive pattern $\underline{312}$ to answer all of our enumerative
questions. The former of the two key cases is enumerated by the Stirling

investigated the dependence of disk structure on the mass of the central object
in the substellar regime based on a homogeneous analysis of Herschel data from
flux density measurements to spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. A
systematic comparison between the derived disk properties and those of sun-like
stars shows that the disk flaring of BDs and very low mass stars is generally
smaller than that of their higher mass counterparts, the disk mass is orders of
magnitude lower than the typical value found in T Tauri stars, and the disk
scale heights are comparable in both sun-like stars and BDs. We further divided
our sample into an early-type brown dwarf (ETBD) group and a late-type brown
dwarf (LTBD) group by using spectral type (=M8) as the border criterion. We
systematically compared the modeling results from Bayesian analysis between
these two groups, and found the trends of flaring index as a function of
spectral type also present in the substellar regime. The spectral type
independence of the scale height is also seen between high-mass and very
low-mass BDs. However, both the ETBD and LTBD groups feature a similar median
disk mass of 10^{-5}Msun and no clear trend is visible in the distribution,
probably due to the uncertainty in translating the far-IR photometry into disk
mass, the detection bias and the age difference among the sample. Unlike
previous studies, our analysis is completely homogeneous in Herschel/PACS data
reduction and modeling with a statistically significant sample. Therefore, we
present evidence of stellar-mass-dependent disk structure down to the
substellar mass regime, which is important for planet formation models.

which translates into the evolution of the survival function of the transient

CMEs with those in cycle 23. We found that the CME speeds in the sky plane were
similar, but almost all those cycle-24 CMEs were halos. A significant fraction
of (16%) of the frontside SEP events were associated with eruptive prominence
events. CMEs associated with filament eruption events accelerate slowly and
attain peak speeds beyond the typical GLE release heights. When we considered
only western hemispheric events that had good connectivity to the CME nose,
there were only 8 events that could be considered as GLE candidates. One turned
out to be the first GLE event of cycle 24 (2012 May 17). In two events, the
CMEs were very fast (>2000 km/s) but they were launched into a tenuous medium
(high Alfven speed). In the remaining five events, the speeds were well below
the typical GLE CME speed (~2000 km/s). Furthermore, the CMEs attained their
peak speeds beyond the typical heights where GLE particles are released. We
conclude that several factors contribute to the low rate of high-energy SEP
events in cycle 24: (i) reduced efficiency of shock acceleration (weak
heliospheric magnetic field), (ii) poor latitudinal and longitudinal
connectivity), and (iii) variation in local ambient conditions (e.g., high
Alfven speed).

non-thermal production of axinos in the context of the MSSM with ten free
parameters. We identify the ranges of the axino mass and the reheating
temperature allowed by the LHC and other particle physics data in different
models of axino interactions. We confront these limits with cosmological
constraints coming the observed dark matter density, large structures formation
and big bang nucleosynthesis. We find a number of differences in the
phenomenologically acceptable values of the axino mass and the reheating
temperature relative to previous studies. In particular, an upper bound on the
axino mass becomes dependent on T_R, reaching a maximum value at T_R~10^2 GeV.

map is subjected to small perturbations. The changes may include births and/or
deaths of zeros. The qualitative properties are defined as the invariances of
an appropriate equivalence relation. The occurrence of a qualitative change in
the zero structures is called a bifurcation and the map is named a singularity.
The local bifurcation analysis of singularities has been extensively studied in
singularity theory and many powerful algebraic tools have been developed for
their study. However, there does not exist any symbolic computer-library for
this purpose. We suitably generalize some powerful tools from algebraic
geometry for correct implementation of the results from singularity theory. We
provide some required criteria along with rigorous proofs for efficient and
cognitive computer-implementation. We have accordingly developed a Maple
end-user friendly library, named Singularity, for an efficient and complete
local bifurcation analysis of real zeros of scalar smooth maps. We have further
written a comprehensive user-guide for Singularity. The main features of
Singularity are briefly illustrated along with a few examples.

in a background of complex resonances and chaotic motion; yet, the precise
dynamical character of these phenomena remains elusive. Recent studies have
shown that the occurrence and nature of the resonances driving these dynamics
depend chiefly on the frequencies of nodal and apsidal precession and the rate
of regression of the Moon's nodes. Woven throughout the inclination and
eccentricity phase space is an exceedingly complicated web-like structure of
lunisolar secular resonances, which become particularly dense near the
inclinations of the navigation satellite orbits. A clear picture of the
physical significance of these resonances is of considerable practical interest
for the design of disposal strategies for the four constellations. Here we
present analytical and semi-analytical models that accurately reflect the true
nature of the resonant interactions, and trace the topological organization of
the manifolds on which the chaotic motions take place. We present an atlas of
FLI stability maps, showing the extent of the chaotic regions of the phase
space, computed through a hierarchy of more realistic, and more complicated,
models, and compare the chaotic zones in these charts with the analytical
estimation of the width of the chaotic layers from the heuristic Chirikov
resonance-overlap criterion. As the semi-major axis of the satellite is
receding, we observe a transition from stable Nekhoroshev-like structures at
three Earth radii, where regular orbits dominate, to a Chirikov regime where
resonances overlap at five Earth radii. From a numerical estimation of the
Lyapunov times, we find that many of the inclined, nearly circular orbits of
the navigation satellites are strongly chaotic and that their dynamics are
unpredictable on decadal timescales.

added flexibility and requires novel computational approaches.
  To address this challenge we propose a generative probabilistic model that
accurately relates latent imaging conditions to observed camera responses.
While principled, realtime inference in the model turns out to be infeasible,
and we propose to employ efficient non-parametric regression trees to
approximate the model outputs. As a result we are able to provide, for each

albedo, and ambient light intensity. These results we present are
state-of-the-art in depth imaging.
  The flexibility of our approach allows us to easily enrich our generative

two-path model, capable of describing some multipath effects. The new model is
seamlessly integrated in the system at no additional computational cost.
  Our work also addresses the important question of optimal exposure design in
pulsed TOF systems. Finally, for benchmark purposes and to obtain realistic
empirical priors of multipath and insights into this phenomena, we propose a

that the relaxation of the state of the system occurs through the scenario of
self-organized criticality (SOC). The process is characterized by the
expectation of a fluctuation necessary for overcoming a local energy barrier of
the metastable state with the subsequent rapid hydrodynamic extrusion of the
liquid under the action of the surface buoyancy forces of the nonwetting
framework. In this case, the dependence of the interaction between local
configurations on the number of filled pores belonging to the infinite
percolation cluster of filled pores serves as an internal feedback initiating
the SOC process. The calculations give a power-law time dependence of the
relative volume of the confined liquid. The developed model of the relaxation

created in 2008. Bitcoin nodes continuously generate and propagate
blocks---collections of newly approved transactions that are added to Bitcoin's
ledger. Block creation requires nodes to invest computational resources, but
also carries a reward in the form of bitcoins that are paid to the creator.
While the protocol requires nodes to quickly distribute newly created blocks,
strong nodes can in fact gain higher payoffs by withholding blocks they create
and selectively postponing their publication. The existence of such selfish
mining attacks was first reported by Eyal and Sirer, who have demonstrated a
specific deviation from the standard protocol (a strategy that we name SM1).
  In this paper we extend the underlying model for selfish mining attacks, and
provide an algorithm to find $\epsilon$-optimal policies for attackers within
the model, as well as tight upper bounds on the revenue of optimal policies. As
a consequence, we are able to provide lower bounds on the computational power
an attacker needs in order to benefit from selfish mining. We find that the
profit threshold -- the minimal fraction of resources required for a profitable
attack -- is strictly lower than the one induced by the SM1 scheme. Indeed, the
policies given by our algorithm dominate SM1, by better regulating
attack-withdrawals.
  Using our algorithm, we show that Eyal and Sirer's suggested countermeasure
to selfish mining is slightly less effective than previously conjectured. Next,
we gain insight into selfish mining in the presence of communication delays,
and show that, under a model that accounts for delays, the profit threshold
vanishes, and even small attackers have incentive to occasionally deviate from
the protocol. We conclude with observations regarding the combined power of
selfish mining and double spending attacks.

improving the energy efficiency, according to the packet loss rate of the

structures to have mutable security labels, i.e., labels that can change over
the course of the computation. This feature is often used to boost the
permissiveness of the IFC monitor, by rejecting fewer runs of programs, and to
reduce the burden of explicit label annotations. However, adding flow-sensitive
constructs (e.g., references or files) to a dynamic IFC system is subtle and
may also introduce high-bandwidth covert channels. In this work, we extend
LIO---a language-based floating-label system---with flow-sensitive references.
The key insight to safely manipulating the label of a reference is to not only
consider the label on the data stored in the reference, i.e., the reference
label, but also the label on the reference label itself. Taking this into
consideration, we provide an upgrade primitive that can be used to change the
label of a reference in a safe manner. We additionally provide a mechanism for
automatic upgrades to eliminate the burden of determining when a reference
should be upgraded. This approach naturally extends to a concurrent setting,
which has not been previously considered by dynamic flow-sensitive systems. For
both our sequential and concurrent calculi we prove non-interference by
embedding the flow-sensitive system into the original, flow-insensitive LIO
calculus---a surprising result on its own.

import quantum probabilities to the reduced sheaf quantum theory. The first is
done by means of a functor that selects some expedient contexts. It defines a
Grothendieck topology on the category consisting of all contexts, hence,
induces a sheaf topos on which we construct a downsized quantum theory. Also,
we show that the sheaf quantum theory can be replaced by an equivalent, more
manageable presheaf quantum theory. Quantum probabilities are imported by means
of a Grothendieck topology that is defined on a category consisting of
probabilities and enables to regard them as intuitionistic truth-values. From
these topologies, we construct another Grothendieck topology that is defined on
the product of the context category and the probability category and reflects
the selection of contexts and the identification of probabilities with
truth-values. We construct a quantum theory equipped with quantum probabilities

candidates are interviewed, one at a time, at a random order, and one has to
decide on the spot, whether to hire a candidate or continue interviewing. It is
well known that the best candidate can be hired with a probability of 1/e
(Dynkin, 1963). Recent works extend this problem to settings in which multiple
candidates can be hired, subject to some constraint. Here, one wishes to hire a
set of candidates maximizing a given set function.
  Almost all extensions considered in the literature assume the objective set
function is either linear or submodular. Unfortunately, real world functions
might not have either of these properties. Consider, for example, a scenario
where one hires researchers for a project. Indeed, it can be that some
researchers can substitute others for that matter. However, it can also be that
some combinations of researchers result in synergy (see, e.g, Woolley et al.,
Science 2010, for a research about collective intelligence). The first
phenomenon can be modeled by a submoudlar set function, while the latter
cannot.
  In this work, we study the secretary problem with an arbitrary non-negative
monotone function, subject to a general matroid constraint. It is not difficult
to prove that, generally, only very poor results can be obtained for this class
of objective functions. We tackle this hardness by combining the following:
1.Parametrizing our algorithms by the supermodular degree of the objective
function (defined by Feige and Izsak, ITCS 2013), which, roughly speaking,
measures the distance of a function from being submodular. 2.Suggesting an
(arguably) natural model that permits approximation guarantees that are
polynomial in the supermodular degree (as opposed to the standard model which
allows only exponential guarantees).

phase-transformation devices, such as the bubble chamber, and charge-transfer
devices like the Geiger-Mueller tube. Quantum measurements are seen to involve
transitions from a long-lived metastable state (e. g., superheated liquid or a
gas of atoms between charged capacitor plates) to a thermodinamically stable
condition. A detector is then a specially prepared object undergoing a
metastable-to-stable transformation that is significantly enhanced by the
presence of the measured particle, which behaves, in some sense, as the seed of
a process of heterogeneous nucleation. Based on this understanding of the
operation of a conventional detector, and using results of
orthogonality-catastrophe theory, we argue that, in the thermodynamic limit,
the pre-measurement Hamiltonian is not the same as that describing the detector
during or after the interaction with a particle and, thus, that superpositions
of pointer states (Schroedinger cats) are unphysical because their time
evolution is ill defined. Examples of particle-induced changes in the

are susceptible to radiation damage, but are not modified by the interaction

allows us to use them to explore the properties of old populations, like the
Galactic halo. We present a population synthesis study of the luminosity
function of halo white dwarfs, aimed at investigating which information can be
derived from the currently available observed data. We employ an up-to-date
population synthesis code based on Monte Carlo techniques, that incorporates
the most recent and reliable cooling sequences for metal poor progenitors as
well as an accurate modeling of the observational biases. We find that because
the observed sample of halo white dwarfs is restricted to the brightest stars
only the hot branch of the white dwarf luminosity function can be used for such
purposes, and that its shape function is almost insensitive to the most
relevant inputs, like the adopted cooling sequences, the initial mass function,
the density profile of the stellar spheroid, or the adopted fraction of
unresolved binaries. Moreover, since the cut-off of the observed luminosity has
not been yet determined only lower limits to the age of the halo population can
be placed. We conclude that the current observed sample of the halo white dwarf

resonance energy transfer (FRET), notably by the local density of optical
states (LDOS), we study an analytic model system wherein a pair of ideal dipole
emitters - donor and acceptor - exhibit energy transfer in the vicinity of an
ideal mirror. The FRET rate is controlled by the mirror up to distances
comparable to the donor-acceptor distance, that is, the few-nanometer range.
For vanishing distance, we find a complete inhibition or a four-fold
enhancement, depending on dipole orientation. For mirror distances on the
wavelength scale, where the well-known `Drexhage' modification of the
spontaneous-emission rate occurs, the FRET rate is constant. Hence there is no
correlation between the Foerster (or total) energy transfer rate and the LDOS.
At any distance to the mirror, the total energy transfer between a
closely-spaced donor and acceptor is dominated by Foerster transfer, i.e., by
the static dipole-dipole interaction that yields the characteristic
inverse-sixth-power donor-acceptor distance dependence in homogeneous media.
Generalizing to arbitrary inhomogeneous media with weak dispersion and weak
absorption in the frequency overlap range of donor and acceptor, we derive two
main theoretical results. Firstly, the spatially dependent Foerster energy
transfer rate does not depend on frequency, hence not on the LDOS. Secondly the
FRET rate is expressed as a frequency integral of the imaginary part of the
Green function. This leads to an approximate FRET rate in terms of the LDOS
integrated over a huge bandwidth from zero frequency to about 10 times the
donor emission frequency, corresponding to the vacuum-ultraviolet. Even then,
the broadband LDOS hardly contributes to the energy transfer rates. We discuss
practical consequences including quantum information processing.

angiogenesis: a phenomenon named tip cell overtaking. It is still unclear to
what extent tip cell overtaking is a side effect of sprouting or to what extent
a biological function. To address this question, we studied tip cell overtaking
in two existing cellular Potts models of angiogenic sprouting. In these models
angiogenic sprouting-like behavior emerges from a small set of plausible cell
behaviors and the endothelial cells spontaneously migrate forwards and
backwards within sprouts, suggesting that tip cell overtaking might occur as a
side effect of sprouting. In accordance with experimental observations, in our
simulations the cells' tendency to occupy the tip position can be regulated
when two cell lines with different levels of Vegfr2 expression are contributing
to sprouting (mosaic sprouting assay), where cell behavior is regulated by a
simple VEGF-Dll4-Notch signaling network. Our modeling results suggest that tip
cell overtaking occurs spontaneously due to the stochastic motion of cells
during sprouting. Thus, tip cell overtaking and sprouting dynamics may be
interdependent and should be studied and interpreted in combination.
VEGF-Dll4-Notch can regulate the ability of cells to occupy the tip cell
position, but only when cells in the simulation strongly differ in their levels
of Vegfr2. We propose that VEGF-Dll4-Notch signaling might not regulate which
cell ends up at the tip, but assures that the cell that randomly ends up at the

Med. 8, 496-502 (2016)",,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Thanks to its immunity to the detection loophole, the Clauser-Horne/Eberhard
inequality plays an important role in tests of locality and in certification of
quantum information protocols based on entanglement. I describe a local model
that violates the inequality using a plausible mechanism relying upon a
parameter of the apparatus, the source emission rate. The effect is generated
through the analysis of time-tagged data using a standard windowed coincidence
counting method. Significantly, the detection times here are not functions of
the measurement settings, i.e., the fair coincidences assumption is satisfied.
This finding has implications for the design and interpretation of experiments
and for quantum information protocols, as it shows that the coincidence window
mechanism cannot be eliminated by a demonstration of independence of the
detection times and settings. The paper describes a reliable coincidence
counting method and shows that it delivers an accurate count of true
coincidences. Recent experimental tests of local realism based on the
Clauser-Horne/Eberhard inequality are considered and it is shown that in one
case (Christensen et al.) the emission rate is appropriately limited to ensure
valid counting, and the data supports locality; in a second case (Giustina et

via their decays into electron and muon pairs in $p+$Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurements are
made using data corresponding to integrated luminosities of 29.4 nb$^{-1}$ and
28.1 nb$^{-1}$ for $Z \rightarrow ee$ and $Z \rightarrow \mu\mu$, respectively.
The results from the two channels are consistent and combined to obtain a cross
section times the $Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$ branching ratio, integrated over the
rapidity region $|y^{*}_{Z}|<3.5$, of 139.8 $\pm$ 4.8 (stat.) $\pm$ 6.2 (syst.)
$\pm$ 3.8 (lumi.) nb. Differential cross sections are presented as functions of
the $Z$ boson rapidity and transverse momentum, and compared with models based
on parton distributions both with and without nuclear corrections. The
centrality dependence of $Z$ boson production in $p+$Pb collisions is measured
and analyzed within the framework of a standard Glauber model and the model's
extension for fluctuations of the underlying nucleon-nucleon scattering cross
section.

Chandra X-ray observatories, we show that five point X-ray sources with
approximately identical fluxes in the 2-10 keV energy band are detected in the
error circle of the object under study. In addition, significant absorption at
low energies has been detected in the spectra of all these sources. Based on
data from the VVV (VISTA/ESO) infrared Galactic Bulge Survey, we have
unambiguously identified three of the five sources, determined the J, H and K
magnitudes of the corresponding stars, and obtained upper limits on the fluxes
for the remaining two sources. Analysis of the color-magnitude diagrams has
shown that one of these objects most likely belongs to a class of rarely
encountered objects, symbiotic binary systems (several tens are known with
certainty), i.e., low-mass binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red
giant. Note that all our results were obtained using improved absorption values
and an extinction law differing in this direction from the standard one.

we consider a mathematical model of vascularized tumor growth and the
corresponding effector cell recruitment dynamics. Bifurcation analysis allows
for the exploration of model's dynamic behavior and the determination of these
parameter regimes that result in immune-mediated tumor control. Here, we focus
on a particular tumor evasion regime that involves tumor and effector cell
concentration oscillations of slowly increasing and decreasing amplitude,
respectively. Considering a temporal multiscale analysis, we derive an
analytically tractable mapping of model solutions onto a weakly negatively
damped harmonic oscillator. Based on our analysis, we propose a theory-driven
intervention strategy involving immunostimulating and immunosuppressive phases
to induce long-term tumor control.

elastic bonds in solids, composed of bonded particles is presented. The model
can be applied for a description of elastic deformation of rocks, ceramics,
concrete, nanocomposites, aerogels and other materials with structural elements
interacting via forces and torques. A material is represented as a set of
particles (rigid bodies) connected by elastic bonds. Vectors rigidly connected
with particles are used for description of particles orientations. Simple
expression for potential energy of a bond is proposed. Corresponding forces and
torques are calculated. Parameters of the potential are related to
longitudinal, transverse (shear), bending, and torsional stiffnesses of the
bond. It is shown that fitting parameters of the potential allows one to
satisfy any values of stiffnesses. Therefore, the model is applicable to bonds
with arbitrary length/thickness ratio. Bond stiffnesses are expressed in terms
of geometrical and elastic properties of the bonds using three models:
Bernoulli-Euler beam, Timoshenko beam, and short elastic cylinder. An approach
for validation of numerical implementation of the model is presented.
Validation is carried out by a comparison of numerical and analytical solutions
of four test problems for a pair of bonded particles. Benchmark expressions for
forces and torques in the case of pure tension/compression, shear, bending and
torsion of a single bond are derived. This approach allows one to minimize the
time required for a numerical implementation of the model.

Ohmic decay related to the scattering from phonons, or due to the Hall cascade
which reaches the Hall attractor. According to our analysis the first
possibility seems to be more reliable. So, we attribute the discovered field
decay mainly to the Ohmic decay on phonons which is saturated at the age
few$\times 10^5$~yrs, when a NS cools down to the critical temperature below
which the phonon scattering does not contribute much to the resistivity of the
crust. Some role of the Hall effect and attractor is not excluded, and will be
analysed in our further studies.

and entanglement-based two-system von Neumann measurement protocols in quantum
theory can be made equivalent by considering the second part of the two-system
scheme to be a Dirac-type negative sea filling up the first system. Based on
this equivalence, and by considering the universe as a computational process,
the choice of the apparatus state in the two-system protocol can be identified
with the choice of the observable in the single-system scheme as negative sea
filling up the observable universe. In particular, the measuring party's state
is considered to be evolving backwards in time to the big bang as a
nondeterministic computational process, which chooses the acceptable path as a
time-reversal process of irreversible computation. The suggested model proposes
that the prepared microstate of the universe, or reality, corresponds to the
observer's choice, therefore, subjective reality. Thus, this effectively
provides a specific description of the subjective universe model previously
proposed, which is based on the symmetry breakdown between the Schrodinger and
the Heisenberg pictures of quantum theory.
