AGC 226067. Originally identified as an ultra-compact high velocity cloud and
candidate Local Group galaxy, AGC 226067 is spatially and kinematically
coincident with the Virgo cluster, and the identification by multiple groups of
an optical counterpart with no resolved stars supports the interpretation that
this systems lies at the Virgo distance (D=17 Mpc). The combined observations
reveal that the system consists of multiple components: a central HI source
associated with the optical counterpart (AGC 226067), a smaller HI-only
component (AGC 229490), a second optical component (AGC 229491), and extended
low surface brightness HI. Only ~1/4 of the single-dish HI emission is
associated with AGC 226067; as a result, we find M_HI/L_g ~ 6 Msun/Lsun, which
is lower than previous work. At D=17 Mpc, AGC 226067 has an HI mass of 1.5 x
10^7 Msun and L_g = 2.4 x 10^6 Lsun, AGC 229490 (the HI-only component) has
M_HI = 3.6 x 10^6 Msun, and AGC 229491 (the second optical component) has L_g =
3.6 x 10^5 Lsun. The nature of this system of three sources is uncertain: AGC
226067 and AGC 229490 may be connected by an HI bridge, and AGC 229490 and AGC
229491 are separated by only 0.5'. The current data do not resolve the HI in
AGC 229490 and its origin is unclear. We discuss possible scenarios for this
system of objects: an interacting system of dwarf galaxies, accretion of
material onto AGC 226067, or stripping of material from AGC 226067.

in the class of \emph{connected} surfaces with prescribed area which are
confined to a small container. We propose a phase field approximation based on
De Giorgi's diffuse Willmore functional to this variational problem. Our main
contribution is a penalisation term which ensures connectedness in the sharp
interface limit. The penalisation of disconnectedness is based on a geodesic
distance chosen to be small between two points that lie on the same connected
component of the transition layer of the phase field.
  We prove that in two dimensions, sequences of phase fields with uniformly
bounded diffuse Willmore energy and diffuse area converge uniformly to the
zeros of a double-well potential away from the support of a limiting measure.
In three dimensions, we show that they converge $\mathcal{H}^1$-almost
everywhere on curves. This enables us to show $\Gamma$-convergence to a sharp
interface problem that only allows for connected structures. The results also
imply Hausdorff convergence of the level sets in two dimensions and a similar
result in three dimensions.
  We furthermore present numerical evidence of the effectiveness of our model.
The implementation relies on a coupling of Dijkstra's algorithm in order to
compute the topological penalty to a finite element approach for the Willmore
term.

of magnification from weak gravitational lensing, using a comparison of number
counts in an arbitrary region of space to the expected unmagnified number
counts. We show that when equivalent lens and source samples are used, this
estimator is simply related to the optimally-weighted correlation function
estimator used in past work and vice-versa, but this method has the benefits
that it can calculate errors with significantly less computational time, that
it can handle overlapping lens and source samples, and that it can easily be
extended to mass-mapping. We present a proof-of-principle test of this method
on data from the CFHTLenS, showing that its calculated magnification signals
agree with predictions from model fits to shear data. Finally, we investigate
how magnification data can be used to supplement shear data in determining the
best-fit model mass profiles for galaxy dark matter haloes. We find that at
redshifts greater than z ~ 0.6, the inclusion of magnification can often
significantly improve the constraints on the components of the mass profile
which relate to galaxies' local environments relative to shear alone, and in
high-redshift, low- and medium-mass bins, it can have a higher signal-to-noise
than the shear signal.

that demandance offers an approach to one of the persistent mysteries of the

variant of the multi-objective simplex (Evans-Steuer) algorithm [12]. Different
from it, the proposed algorithm works in the parameter space and does not aim
to find the set of all efficient solutions. Instead, it finds a solution in the
sense of Loehne [16], that is, it finds a subset of efficient solutions that
allows to generate the whole frontier. In that sense, it can also be seen as a
generalization of the parametric self-dual simplex algorithm, which originally
is designed for solving single objective linear optimization problems, and is
modified to solve two objective bounded LVOPs with the positive orthant as the
ordering cone in Ruszczynski and Vanderbei [21]. The algorithm proposed here
works for any dimension, any solid pointed polyhedral ordering cone C and for
bounded as well as unbounded problems. Numerical results are provided to
compare the proposed algorithm with an objective space based LVOP algorithm
(Benson algorithm in [13]), that also provides a solution in the sense of [16],
and with Evans-Steuer algorithm [12]. The results show that for non-degenerate
problems the proposed algorithm outperforms Benson algorithm and is on par with
Evan-Steuer algorithm. For highly degenerate problems Benson's algorithm [13]
excels the simplex-type algorithms; however, the parametric simplex algorithm
is for these problems computationally much more efficient than Evans-Steuer
algorithm.

battery systems in electric vehicles (EVs). Charging is crucial for the battery
performance and life as well as a contributory factor to a user's confidence in
or anxiety about EVs. For the existing practices and methods, many run with a
lack of battery health awareness during charging, and none includes the user
needs into the charging loop. To remedy such deficiencies, we propose to
perform charging that, for the first time, allows the user to specify charging
objectives and accomplish them through dynamic control, in addition to
suppressing the charging-induced negative effects on battery health. Two
charging strategies are developed using the linear quadratic control theory.
Among them, one is based on control with fixed terminal charging state, and the
other on tracking a reference charging path. They are computationally
competitive, without requiring real-time constrained optimization as needed in
most charging techniques available in the literature. A simulation-based study
demonstrates their effectiveness and potential. It is anticipated that charging
with health awareness and user involvement guaranteed by the proposed
strategies will bring major improvements to not only the battery longevity but
also the EV user satisfaction.

that exhibit a modular structure characterized by one large bank community,
some small ones and isolated banks. There exist compact structures that have
synchronized dynamics. Many groups of banks merge together creating a financial
network topology that converges to a unique big cluster at a relatively low
leverage dependence level. Finally, we propose a model that includes corporate

networks similar to the empirical ones. Moreover, we find that faster-growing

structure accounts for magnetic free energy storage and solar eruptions. Up to
the present, the extrapolation of magnetic field from boundary data is the
primary way to obtain fully three-dimensional magnetic information of the
corona. As a result, the ability of reliable recovering coronal magnetic flux
rope is important for coronal field extrapolation. In this paper, our coronal
field extrapolation code (CESE-MHD-NLFFF, Jiang & Feng 2012) is examined with
an analytical magnetic flux rope model proposed by Titov & Demoulin (1999),
which consists of a bipolar magnetic configuration holding an semi-circular
line-tied flux rope in force-free equilibrium. By using only the vector field
in the bottom boundary as input, we test our code with the model in a
representative range of parameter space and find that the model field is
reconstructed with high accuracy. Especially, the magnetic topological
interfaces formed between the flux rope and the surrounding arcade, i.e., the
""hyperbolic flux tube"" and ""bald patch separatrix surface"", are also reliably
reproduced. By this test, we demonstrate that our CESE-MHD-NLFFF code can be
applied to recovering magnetic flux rope in the solar corona as long as the
vector magnetogram satisfies the force-free constraints.

Symb. Comput. 2003; Babai, Codenotti & Qiao, ICALP 2012) imply that GpI reduces
to the following: given groups G, H with characteristic subgroups of the same
type and isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$, and given the coset of isomorphisms
$Iso(G/\mathbb{Z}_p^d, H/\mathbb{Z}_p^d)$, compute Iso(G, H) in time poly(|G|).
Babai & Qiao (STACS 2012) solved this problem when a Sylow p-subgroup of
$G/\mathbb{Z}_p^d$ is trivial. In this paper, we solve the preceding problem in
the so-called ""tame"" case, i.e., when a Sylow p-subgroup of $G/\mathbb{Z}_p^d$
is cyclic, dihedral, semi-dihedral, or generalized quaternion. These cases
correspond exactly to the group algebra
$\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[G/\mathbb{Z}_p^d]$ being of tame type, as in the
celebrated tame-wild dichotomy in representation theory. We then solve new
cases of GpI in polynomial time.
  Our result relies crucially on the divide-and-conquer strategy proposed
earlier by the authors (CCC 2014), which splits GpI into two problems, one on
group actions (representations), and one on group cohomology. Based on this
strategy, we combine permutation group and representation algorithms with new
mathematical results, including bounds on the number of indecomposable
representations of groups in the tame case, and on the size of their cohomology
groups.
  Finally, we note that when a group extension is not tame, the preceding
bounds do not hold. This suggests a precise sense in which the tame-wild
dichotomy from representation theory may also be a dividing line between the
(currently) easy and hard instances of GpI.

vehicle capable of flight and underwater navigation. However, a fully
functional vehicle has not yet been realized. We present the first fully
functional vehicle platform operating in air and underwater with seamless
transition between both mediums. These unique capabilities combined with the
hovering, high maneuverability and reliability of multirotor vehicles, results
in a disruptive technology for both civil and military application including
air/water search and rescue, inspection, repairs and survey missions among
others. The invention was built on a bio-inspired locomotion force analysis
that combines flight and swimming. Three main advances in the present work has
allowed this invention. The first is the discovery of a seamless transition
method between air and underwater. The second is the design of a multi-medium
propulsion system capable of efficient operation in air and underwater. The
third combines the requirements for lift and thrust for flight (for a given
weight) and the requirements for thrust and neutral buoyancy (in water) for
swimming. The result is a careful balance between lift, thrust, weight, and
neutral buoyancy implemented in the vehicle design. A fully operational
prototype demonstrated the flight, and underwater navigation capabilities as
well as the rapid air/water and water/air transition.

estimate Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs). We show the graph selection
consistency of this method in the sense that the posterior probability of the
true model converges to one. When there are multiple groups of data available,
instead of estimating the networks independently for each group, joint
estimation of the networks may utilize the shared information among groups and
lead to improved estimation for each individual network. Our method is extended
to jointly estimate GGMs in multiple groups of data with complex structures,
including spatial data, temporal data and data with both spatial and temporal
structures. Markov random field (MRF) models are used to efficiently
incorporate the complex data structures. We develop and implement an efficient
algorithm for statistical inference that enables parallel computing. Simulation
studies suggest that our approach achieves better accuracy in network
estimation compared with methods not incorporating spatial and temporal
dependencies when there are shared structures among the networks, and that it
performs comparably well otherwise. Finally, we illustrate our method using the
human brain gene expression microarray dataset, where the expression levels of
genes are measured in different brain regions across multiple time periods.

instability, they grow in mass by accretion of supersonic flows. These flows
partially dissipate into heat through a complex network of large-scale shocks
[1], while residual transonic flows create giant turbulent eddies and cascades

magnetic energy by way of dynamo action [5-8]. However, the pattern regulating
the transformation of gravitational energy into kinetic, thermal, turbulent and

the intra-cluster medium are ordered according to a permanent hierarchy, in
which the ratio of thermal to turbulent to magnetic energy densities remains
virtually unaltered throughout the cluster's history, despite evolution of each
individual component and the drive towards equipartition of the turbulent
dynamo. This result revolves around the approximately constant efficiency of
turbulence generation from the gravitational energy that is freed during mass
accretion, revealed by our computational model of cosmological structure
formation [3,9]. The permanent character of this hierarchy reflects yet another

number-density in time, one can infer the evolution of their properties, such

the presence of galaxy mergers or when rank ordering is broken owing to
variable stellar growth rates. We present an analysis of the evolving comoving

primary results are as follows: 1) The inferred average stellar mass evolution
obtained via a constant comoving number density assumption is systematically
biased compared to the merger tree results at the factor of $\sim$2(4) level
when tracking galaxies from redshift $z=0$ out to redshift $z=2(3)$; 2) The
median number density evolution for galaxy populations tracked forward in time
is shallower than for galaxy populations tracked backward in time; 3) A similar
evolution in the median number density of tracked galaxy populations is found
regardless of whether number density is assigned via stellar mass, stellar
velocity dispersion, or dark matter halo mass; 4) Explicit tracking reveals a
large diversity in galaxies' assembly histories that cannot be captured by
constant number-density analyses; 5) The significant scatter in galaxy linking
methods is only marginally reduced by considering a number of additional

novel analytical models of systems in chemical equilibrium that include carbon

equilibrium constants of the chemical reactions to temperature and pressure via
the tabulated Gibbs free energies. We prove that such chemical systems may be
described by a quintic equation for the mixing ratio of methane. By examining
the abundances of these molecules across a broad range of temperatures
(spanning equilibrium temperatures from 600 to 2500 K), pressures (via
temperature-pressure profiles that explore albedo and opacity variations) and
carbon-to-oxygen ratios, we conclude that carbon dioxide is subdominant

conclusion if carbon dioxide is subdominant everywhere in the atmosphere.
Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide may attain comparable abundances if the
metallicity is greatly enhanced, but this property is negated by temperatures
above 1000 K. For hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, our generic result has the
implication that retrieval studies may wish to set the subdominance of carbon
dioxide as a prior of the calculation and not let its abundance completely roam
free as a fitting parameter, because it directly affects the inferred value of
the carbon-to-oxygen ratio and may produce unphysical conclusions. We discuss

place lower limits on the cloud sizes (l>0.4 kpc) for these absorbers given the

value of the circular velocity attained by a subhalo while it satisfies a
relaxation criterion, is the subhalo property that correlates most strongly
with galaxy stellar mass ($M_{\rm star}$). Using this parameter in SHAM, we
retrieve the real-space clustering of EAGLE to within our statistical
uncertainties on scales greater than $2$ Mpc for galaxies with
$8.77<\log_{10}(M_{\rm star}[M_\odot])<10.77$. Conversely, clustering is
overestimated by $30\%$ on scales below $2$ Mpc for galaxies with
$8.77<\log_{10}(M_{\rm star}[M_\odot])<9.77$ because SHAM slightly overpredicts
the fraction of satellites in massive haloes compared to EAGLE. The agreement
is even better in redshift-space, where the clustering is recovered to within
our statistical uncertainties for all masses and separations. Additionally, we
analyse the dependence of galaxy clustering on properties other than halo mass,
i.e. the assembly bias. We demonstrate assembly bias alters the clustering in
EAGLE by $20\%$ and that $V_{\rm relax}$ captures its effect to within $15\%$.
We trace small differences in the clustering to the failure of SHAM as
typically implemented, i.e. the $M_{\rm star}$ assigned to a subhalo does not
depend on i) its host halo mass, ii) whether it is a central or a satellite. In
EAGLE we find that these assumptions are not completely satisfied.

measurements are the results of a long-term survey that includes data from
seven telescopes with observations for some stars spanning over 40 years. For
narrow-lined stars, RVs are measured with precisions ranging from about 0.1 to
0.8 km/s. The combined stellar sample reaches from the brightest giants in the
cluster down to about 4 magnitudes below the main-sequence turnoff (V = 16.5),
covering a mass range of about 1.34 MSun to 0.76 MSun. Spatially, the sample
extends to a radius of 30 arcmin (7.4 pc in projection at a distant of 850 pc

internal precision of +/- 0.03 km/s). For stars with >=3 measurements, we
derive RV membership probabilities and identify RV variables, finding 562
cluster members, 142 of which show significant RV variability. We use these
cluster members to construct a color-magnitude diagram and identify a rich
sample of stars that lie far from the standard single star isochrone, including
the well-known blue stragglers, sub-subgiants and yellow giants. These exotic
stars have a binary frequency of (at least) 80%, more than three times that
detected for stars in the remainder of the sample. We confirm that the cluster
is mass segregated, finding the binaries to be more centrally concentrated than
the single stars in our sample at the 99.8% confidence level. The blue
stragglers are centrally concentrated as compared to the solar-type
main-sequence single stars in the cluster at the 99.7% confidence level.
Accounting for both measurement precision and undetected binaries, we derive a
RV dispersion in M67 of 0.59 +0.07 -0.06 km/s, which yields a virial mass for

fiducial assumptions about the timescale for cloud shredding from
high-resolution simulations (which neglect magnetic fields) we show that cool
clouds with temperature from $T_{c}\sim 10^{2}-10^{4}$ K seen in emission and
absorption in galactic winds cannot be accelerated to observed velocities by
the ram pressure of a hot wind. Taking into account both the radial structure
of the hot flow and gravity, we show that this conclusion holds over a wide
range of galaxy, cloud, and hot wind properties. This finding calls into
question the prevailing picture whereby the cool atomic gas seen in galactic
winds is entrained and accelerated by the hot flow. Given these difficulties
with ram pressure acceleration, we discuss alternative models for the origin of
high velocity cool gas outflows. Another possibility is that magnetic fields in
cool clouds are sufficiently important that they prolong the cloud's life. For
$T_{c}=10^{3}$\,K and $10^{4}$\,K clouds, we show that if conductive
evaporation can be neglected, the cloud shredding timescale must be $\sim15$

Here we investigate its power when using general extreme value statistics which

caused by galaxy clusters, large-scale structures and observational noise.
Doing so, we further improve the method in the regime of high signal-to-noise

those counts into the surrounding shear caused by large scale structures. We
derive the extreme value and order statistics for both over-densities (positive
peaks) and under-densities (negative peaks) and provide an optimized criterion
to split a wide field survey into sub-fields in order to sample the
distribution of extreme values such that the expected objects causing the

our model predictions with a ray-tracing $N$-body simulation. For a Euclid-like

the voltages of the MTDC grid, asymptotically minimizing a quadratic cost
function of the deviations from the nominal DC voltages. The results are valid

systems of arbitrary number of synchronous machines, each modeled by the swing

This conjecture states that, for any RG flow from one conformal fixed point to
another, $\tilde F_{\rm UV} > \tilde F_{\rm IR}$, where $\tilde F=\sin (\pi

a specific example of the Wilson-Fisher $O(N)$ model and define this CFT on the
sphere $S^{4-\epsilon}$, paying careful attention to the beta functions for the
coefficients of curvature terms. This allows us to develop the $\epsilon$
expansion of $\tilde F$ up to order $\epsilon^5$. Pade extrapolation of this
series to $d=3$ gives results that are around $2-3\%$ below the free field

types of cancers this leads, even in the presence of oxygen, to the secretion
of carbon equivalents (usually in the form of lactate) in the cell's
surroundings, a feature known as the Warburg effect. While the molecular basis
of this phenomenon are still to be elucidated, it is clear that the spilling of
energy resources contributes to creating a peculiar microenvironment for
tumors, possibly characterized by a degree of toxicity. This suggests that
mechanisms for recycling the fermentation products (e.g. a lactate shuttle) may
be active, effectively inducing a mutually beneficial metabolic coupling
between aberrant and non-aberrant cells. Here we analyze this scenario through
a large-scale in silico metabolic model of interacting human cells. By going
beyond the cell-autonomous description, we show that elementary
physico-chemical constraints indeed favor the establishment of such a coupling

of a rheological model for suspensions. The model is solved by means of three
different but complementary routes, two of them being theoretical (Grad's
moment method applied to the corresponding Boltzmann equation and an exact
solution of a kinetic model adapted to granular suspensions) and the other
being computational (Monte Carlo simulations of the Boltzmann equation). Unlike
in previous studies on granular sheared suspensions, we include in our Grad's

the performance of terminated SC-LDPC codes by random shortening of tail-biting
SC-LDPC codes. We find the minimum required rate-loss in order to achieve the
same performance than terminated codes. We additionally study the use of
tail-biting SC-LDPC codes for transmission over parallel channels (e.g.,
bit-interleaved-coded-modulation (BICM)) and investigate how the distribution
of the coded bits between two parallel channels can change the performance of
the code. We show that a tail-biting SC-LDPC code can be used with BP decoding
almost anywhere within the achievable region of MAP decoding. The optimization
comes with a mandatory buffer at the encoder side. We evaluate different
distributions of coded bits in order to reduce this buffer length.

flexibility, scalability, and utilization of computational assets. However, the
performance depends critically on how the limited data processing resources are

processing load imposed by each device depends on its allocated transmission
rate and channel quality, the rate-allocation aspect of the scheduling should
take into account the available computing. In this paper, two computationally
aware schedulers are proposed that have the objective of maximizing the
sum-rate of the system while satisfying a constraint on the offered
computational load. The first scheduler optimally allocates resources and is
implemented according to a water-filling algorithm. The second scheduler is
suboptimal, but uses a simpler and intuitive complexity-cut-off approach. The
performance of both schedulers is evaluated using an LTE-compliant system level
simulator. It is found that both schedulers avoid outages that are caused by an
overflow of computational load (i.e., computational outages) at the cost of a
slight loss of sum-rate.

suggested a higher metallicity of [Fe/H] = -4.3 due to the CaII K line blending
with a CH feature which is a common issue related to the search for the most
iron-poor stars. This star joins several other, similar stars with [Fe/H] <

Other elemental abundances of SD 1313-0019 follow that of more metal-rich halo
stars. From fitting the abundance pattern with yields of Population III

with 20 - 30 M_sun that must have undergone a mixing and fallback episode.
Overall, there are now five stars known with [Fe/H] < -5.0 (1D LTE abundances).
This population of second-generation stars strongly suggests massive first
stars that almost exclusively produced large amounts of carbon through stellar

their natal clouds -- presumably some early minihalo structures -- contained
ample amounts of carbon and oxygen that likely facilitated the formation of

in the ~ TeV to ~ EeV rest-mass range, possibly associated with new physics at
high-energy scales. The process of dilution can give the sterile neutrinos the
appropriate relic densities, but it also alters their energy spectra so that
they could act like cold dark matter, despite relatively low rest masses as
compared to conventional dark matter candidates. Moreover, since the model does
not rely on active-sterile mixing for producing the relic density, the mixing
angles can be small enough to evade current x-ray or lifetime constraints.

Because of the small encounter distance and the high relative velocity, the
goal of successfully observing C/2013 A1 from the Mars orbiting spacecrafts
posed strict accuracy requirements on the comet's ephemerides. These
requirements were hard to meet, as comets are known for being highly
unpredictable: astrometric observations can be significantly biased and
nongravitational perturbations affect comet trajectories. Therefore, even prior
to the encounter, we remeasured a couple of hundred astrometric images obtained
with ground-based and Earth-orbiting telescopes. We also observed the comet
with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's High Resolution Imaging Science
Experiment (HiRISE) camera on 2014 October 7. In particular, these HiRISE
observations were decisive in securing the trajectory and revealed that
out-of-plane nongravitational perturbations were larger than previously
assumed. Though the resulting ephemeris predictions for the Mars encounter
allowed observations of the comet from the Mars orbiting spacecrafts,
post-encounter observations show a discrepancy with the pre-encounter
trajectory. We reconcile this discrepancy by employing the Rotating Jet Model,
which is a higher fidelity model for nongravitational perturbations and
provides an estimate of C/2013 A1's spin pole.

(formerly P/2014 S4) taken over the five month interval from 2014 October to

in two different orbits, a property that is naturally explained by the
sublimation of near surface ice but which is difficult to reconcile with other
activity mechanisms. We find that the mass loss peaks near 1 kg s$^{-1}$ in
October and then declines over the subsequent months by about a factor of five,
at nearly constant heliocentric distance. This decrease is too large to be
caused by the change in heliocentric distance during the period of observation.
However, it is consistent with sublimation from an ice patch shadowed by local
topography, for example in a pit like those observed on the nuclei of
short-period comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. While no unique interpretation is
possible, a simple self shadowing model shows that sublimation from a pit with
depth to diameter ratio near 1/2 matches the observed rate of decline of the
activity, while deeper and shallower pits do not. We estimate the nucleus
radius to be 700$\pm$100 m (geometric albedo 0.05 assumed). Measurements of the
spatial distribution of the dust were obtained from different viewing
geometries. They show that dust was ejected continuously not impulsively, that
the effective particle size is large, $\sim$50 $\mu m$, and that the ejection
speed is $\sim$2.5 m s$^{-1}$. The total dust mass ejected is $\sim$10$^7$ kg,
corresponding to $\sim$10$^{-5}$ of the nucleus mass. The observations are
consistent with partially shadowed sublimation from $\sim$10$^4$ m$^2$ of ice,

that although each value of the coupling does not produce synchronization,
switching between the two at a high frequency stabilizes the synchronization

to develop a randomized primal-dual gradient (RPDG) method, which needs to

to use different broad-band chaotic phase shifts, generated by electro-optic

information-bearing quantum signals coming from different users, and then
recover the masked quantum signals at the receiver side by imposing opposite
chaotic phase shifts. The chaotic phase shifts given to different pairs of
users are almost uncorrelated due to the randomness of chaos and thus the
quantum signals from different pair of users can be distinguished even when
they are sent via the same quantum channel. It is shown that two
maximally-entangled states can be generated between two pairs of users by our
method mediated by bright coherent lights, which can be more easily implemented
in experiments compared with single-photon lights. Our method is robust under
the channel noises if only the decay rates of the information-bearing fields

temperatures using simulations of the coarse-grained Self-Organized-Polymer

variations with pH, is in excellent agreement with scattering experiments. At
$T_m$ Ub folds in a two-state manner at low and neutral pH. Clustering analysis
of the conformations sampled in equilibrium folding trajectories at $T_m$, with
multiple transitions between the folded and unfolded states, show a network of
metastable states connecting the native and unfolded states. At low and neutral
pH, Ub folds with high probability through a preferred set of conformations
resulting in a pH-dependent dominant folding pathway. Folding kinetics reveal
that Ub assembly at low pH occurs by multiple pathways involving a combination
of nucleation-collapse and diffusion collision mechanism. The mechanism by
which Ub folds is dictated by the stability of the key secondary structural
elements responsible for establishing long range contacts and collapse of Ub.
Nucleation collapse mechanism holds if the stability of these elements are
marginal, as would be the case at elevated temperatures. If the lifetimes
associated with these structured microdomains are on the order of hundreds of
$\mu sec$ then Ub folding follows the diffusion-collision mechanism with
intermediates many of which coincide with those found in equilibrium. Folding
at neutral pH is a sequential process with a populated intermediate resembling
that sampled at equilibrium. The transition state structures, obtained using a
$P_{fold}$ analysis, are homogeneous and globular with most of the secondary
and tertiary structures being native-like. Many of our findings are not only in
agreement with experiments but also provide missing details not resolvable in

WiggleZ and BOSS DR11, and JLA compilation of Type Ia supernova observations,
is adopted to confine the parameters. Within the context of the $\phi$CDM model
under consideration, the joint sample determines the cosmological parameters to
high precision. It turns out that $\alpha <4.995$ at 95% CL for the $\phi$CDM
model. And yet, the $\Lambda$CDM scenario corresponding to $\alpha = 0$ is not
ruled out at 95% CL. Moreover, we get $\Sigma m_{\nu}< 0.262$ eV at 95% CL for
the $\phi$CDM model, while the corresponding one for the $\Lambda$CDM model is
$\Sigma m_{\nu} < 0.293$ eV. The allowed scale of $\Sigma m_\nu$ in the
$\phi$CDM model is a bit smaller than that in the $\Lambda$CDM model. It is
consistent with the qualitative analysis, which reveals that the increases of
$\alpha$ and $\Sigma m_\nu$ both can result in the suppression of the matter
power spectrum. As a consequence, when $\alpha$ is larger, in order to avoid
suppressing the matter power spectrum too much, the value of $\Sigma m_\nu$
should be smaller.

accuracy of simultaneous measurement of non-commuting observables as stating
that canonically conjugate observables can be measured simultaneously only with
the constraint that the product of their mean errors should be no less than a
limit set by Planck's constant. However, Heisenberg with the subsequent
completion by Kennard has long been credited only with a constraint for state
preparation represented by the product of the standard deviations. Here, we
show that Heisenberg actually proved the constraint for the accuracy of
simultaneous measurement but assuming an obsolete postulate for quantum
mechanics. This assumption, known as the repeatability hypothesis, formulated
explicitly by von Neumann and Schr\""{o}dinger, was broadly accepted until the
1970s, but abandoned in the 1980s, when completely general quantum measurement
theory was established. We also survey the author's recent proposal for a
universally valid reformulation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle under the
most general assumption on quantum measurement.

estimates the weights by recursively updating its posterior distribution. For a
specified class of loss functions, we show that it is possible to formulate a
suitably defined likelihood function and hence use the posterior distribution
as an approximation to the global empirical loss minimizer. If the stream of
training data is sampled from a stationary process, we can also show that our

properties that have traditionally have been assumed to be true. Among other
features, their results do not satisfy the postulates of thermodynamics
originally proposed by Tisza and Callen. In their theory, differences in the
temperatures of two objects cannot determine the direction of heat flow when
they are brought into thermal contact. They deny that negative temperatures are
possible. We disagree with most of their assertions, and we present arguments
in favor of a more traditional interpretation of thermodynamics. We show
explicitly that it is possible to deduce the thermodynamic entropy for a
paramagnet along the lines of classical thermodynamics and that it agrees with
Boltzmann entropy in equilibrium. A Carnot engine with efficiency larger than
one is a matter of definition and is possible for inverted energy
distributions, regardless of whether negative temperatures are used in the
analysis. We elaborate on Penrose's argument that an adiabatic and reversible
process connecting systems with Hamiltonian $H$ to $-H$ is possible, thus
negative temperatures logically must exist. We give a demonstration that the
Boltzmann temperature determines the direction of heat flow while Gibbs
temperature does not, for sufficiently large systems.

the con- cept of unimodality to multidimensions and allows for certain types of
saddle points, which are a known hurdle for first-order optimization methods
such as gradient descent. Locally-Lipschitz functions are only required to be
Lipschitz in a small region around the optimum. This assumption circumvents
gradient explosion, which is another known hurdle for gradient descent
variants. Interestingly, unlike the vanilla SGD algorithm, the stochastic
normalized gradient descent algorithm provably requires a minimal minibatch
size.

chemical evolution of stars. Therefore, momentum exchanges between waves
propagating in stars, differential rotation, and meridional circulation must be
carefully evaluated. In this work, we study axisymmetric mean flows in rapidly
and initially uniformly rotating massive stars driven by small amplitude
non-axisymmetric $\kappa$-driven oscillations. We treat them as perturbations
of second-order of the oscillation amplitudes and derive their governing
equations as a set of coupled linear ordinary differential equations. This
allows us to compute 2-D zonal and meridional mean flows driven by low
frequency $g$- and $r$-modes in slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars and $p$-modes in
$\beta$ Cephei stars. Oscillation-driven mean flows usually have large
amplitudes only in the surface layers. In addition, the kinetic energy of the
induced 2-D zonal rotational motions is much larger than that of the meridional
motions. In some cases, meridional flows have a complex radial and latitudinal
structure. For SPB stars, we find that there are low frequency retrograde
$g$-modes and $r$-modes that drive mean flows with positive velocity components
in the radial and azimuthal directions at the stellar surface. This suggests
that low frequency retrograde modes can transport angular momentum to the
surface layers, which may help to form a circumstellar gaseous disc. Moreover,
pulsation-driven and rotation-driven meridional flows can have similar
amplitudes. These results show the importance of taking wave-- mean flow
interactions into account when studying the evolution of massive stars.

the key factors impacting the network energy consumption and the system
overhead. In this paper, a novel connectivity-aware approximation algorithm for
relay node placement in WSNs is proposed to offer a major step forward in
saving system overhead. Specifically, a unique Local Search Approximation
Algorithm (LSAA) is introduced to solve the Relay Node Single Cover (RNSC)
problem. In this proposed LSAA approach, the sensor nodes are allocated into
groups and then a local Set Cover (SC) for each group is achieved by a local
search algorithm. The union set of all local SCs constitutes a SC of the RNSC
problem. The approximation ratio and the time complexity of the LSAA are
analyzed by rigorous proof. Additionally, the LSAA approach has been extended
to solve the relay node double cover problem. Then, a Relay Location Selection
Algorithm (RLSA) is proposed to utilize the resulting SC from LSAA in combining
RLSA with the minimum spanning tree heuristic to build the high-tier
connectivity. As the RLSA searches for a nearest location to the sink node for
each relay node, the high-tier network built by RLSA becomes denser than that
by existing works. As a result, the number of added relay nodes for building
the connectivity of the high-tier WSN can be significantly saved. Simulation
results clearly demonstrate that the proposed LSAA outperforms the approaches
reported in literature and the RLSA-based algorithm can noticeably save relay
nodes newly deployed for the high-tier connectivity.

Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as filter banks in place of PCA. This is
motivated by the fact that 2D DCT basis is indeed a good approximation for high
ranked eigenvectors of PCA. Both 2D DCT and PCA resemble a kind of modulated
sine-wave patterns, which can be perceived as a bandpass filter bank. DCTNet is
free from learning as 2D DCT bases can be computed in advance. Besides that, we
also proposed an effective method to regulate the block-wise histogram feature
vector of DCTNet for robustness. It is shown to provide surprising performance
boost when the probe image is considerably different in appearance from the

from the graph except the trivial one. The fixing number of a graph $G$,
denoted by $fix(G)$, is the smallest cardinality of a fixing set of $G$. In
this paper, we study the fixing number of composition product, $G_1[G_2]$ and
corona product, $G_1 \odot G_2$ of two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ with orders $m$
and $n$ respectively. We show that for a connected graph $G_1$ and an arbitrary
graph $G_2$ having $l\geq 1$ components $G_2^1$, $G_2^2$, ... $G_2^l,$
$mn-1\geq fix(G_1[G_2])\geq m\left(\sum \limits_{i=1}^{l} fix(G_2^i )\right)$.
For a connected graph $G_1$ and an arbitrary graph $G_2$, which are not
asymmetric, we prove that $fix(G_1\odot G_2)=m fix( G_2)$. Further, for an
arbitrary connected graph $G_{1}$ and an arbitrary graph $G_{2}$ we show that
$fix(G_1\odot G_2)= max\{fix(G_1), m fix(G_2)\}$.

photometry, we develop a photometric calibration for estimating the stellar
metallicity from $u-g$ and $g-r$ colors by using the SDSS spectra of 32,542 F-
and G-type main sequence stars, which cover almost $3700$ deg$^{2}$ in the
south Galactic cap. The rms scatter of the photometric metallicity residuals
relative to spectrum-based metallicity is $0.14$ dex when $g-r<0.4$, and $0.16$
dex when $g-r>0.4$. Due to the deeper and more accurate magnitude of SCUSS $u$
band, the estimate can be used up to the faint magnitude of $g=21$. This
application range of photometric metallicity calibration is wide enough so that
it can be used to study metallicity distribution of distant stars. In this
study, we select the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream and its neighboring field halo
stars in south Galactic cap to study their metallicity distribution. We find
that the Sgr stream at the cylindrical Galactocentric coordinate of $R\sim 19$
kpc, $\left| z\right| \sim 14$ kpc exhibits a relative rich metallicity
distribution, and the neighboring field halo stars in our studied fields can be
modeled by two-Gaussian model, with peaks respectively at [Fe/H]$=-1.9$ and
[Fe/H]$=-1.5$.

stars and clusters. This second study of W3 within the HOBYS Key Program
provides a comparative analysis of subfields within W3 to further constrain the
processes leading to the observed structures and stellar population.
Probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative mass distributions (CMDs)
were created from dust column density maps, quantified as extinction Av. The
shape of the PDF, typically represented with a lognormal function at low Av
""breaking"" to a power-law tail at high Av, is influenced by various processes
including turbulence and self-gravity. The breaks can also be identified, often
more readily, in the CMDs. The PDF break from lognormal (Av(SF)= 6-10 mag)
appears to shift to higher Av by stellar feedback, so that high-mass
star-forming regions tend to have higher PDF breaks. A second break at Av > 50
mag traces structures formed or influenced by a dynamic process. Because such a
process has been suggested to drive high-mass star formation in W3, this second
break might then identify regions with potential for hosting high-mass
stars/clusters. Stellar feedback appears to be a major mechanism driving the
local evolution and state of regions within W3. A high initial star formation
efficiency in a dense medium could result in a self-enhancing process, leading
to more compression and favourable star-formation conditions (e.g., colliding
flows), a richer stellar content, and massive stars. This scenario would be
compatible with the ""convergent constructive feedback"" model introduced in our
previous Herschel study.

been attracting increasing interest also from the viewpoint of possible
applications in astrophysics and cosmology, where spacetime curvature cannot be
neglected. Nonetheless the interplay between Planck-scale effects and spacetime
curvature is still poorly understood, particularly in cases where curvature is
not constant. These challenges have been so far postponed by relying on an
ansatz, first introduced by Jacob and Piran. We here propose a general strategy
of analysis of the effects of modifications of dispersion relation in FRW
spacetimes, applicable both to cases where the relativistic equivalence of
frames is spoiled (""preferred-frame scenarios"") and to the alternative
possibility of ""DSR-relativistic theories"", theories that are fully
relativistic but with relativistic laws deformed so that the modified
dispersion relation is observer independent. We show that the Jacob-Piran
ansatz implicitly assumes that spacetime translations are not affected by the
Planck-scale, while under rather general conditions the same Planck-scale
quantum-spacetime structures producing modifications of the dispersion relation
also affect translations. Through the explicit analysis of one of the effects
produced by modifications of the dispersion relation, an effect amounting to
Planck-scale corrections to travel times, we show that our concerns are not
merely conceptual but rather can have significant quantitative implications.

We used archival GALEX (FUV and NUV) and SDSS images, as well as Hyperleda and

that UGC 7639 inner regions are composed mostly by young stellar populations.
In addition, we used smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with
chemo-photometric implementation to account for its formation and evolution.
UGC 7639 is an example of blue dwarf galaxy whose global properties are well
matched by our multi-wavelength and multi-technique approach, that is also a
suitable approach to highlight the evolution of these galaxies as a class. We
found that the global properties of UGC 7639, namely its total absolute B-band
magnitude, its whole spectral energy distribution (SED), and its morphology are
well-matched by an encounter with a system four times more massive than our
target. Moreover, the current star formation rate (SFR) of the simulated dwarf,
~0.03 M_sun yr-1, is in good agreement with our UV-based estimate. For UGC
7639, we estimated a galaxy age of 8.6 Gyr. Following our simulation, the
ongoing star formation will extinguish within 1.6 Gyr, thus leaving a red dwarf

and supersedes previous versions of the Planck compact source catalogues. It
consists of compact sources, both Galactic and extragalactic, detected over the
entire sky. Compact sources detected in the lower frequency channels are
assigned to the PCCS2, while at higher frequencies they are assigned to one of
two sub-catalogues, the PCCS2 or PCCS2E, depending on their location on the
sky. The first of these catalogues covers most of the sky and allows the user
to produce subsamples at higher reliabilities than the target 80% integral
reliability of the catalogue. The PCCS2E contains sources detected in sky
regions where the diffuse emission makes it difficult to quantify the
reliability of the detections. Both the PCCS2 and PCCS2E include polarization
measurements, in the form of polarized flux densities, or upper limits, and
orientation angles for all seven polarization-sensitive Planck channels. The
improved data-processing of the full-mission maps and their reduced noise
levels allow us to increase the number of objects in the catalogue, improving
its completeness for the target 80 % reliability as compared with the previous

the presence of significant other causes of light variation, in particular
non-radial pulsations. We apply a low-frequency filtering procedure to separate
out some of this additional light variation. Whilst the derived eccentricity

initial values or guesses to achieve convergence to the desired solution, which
typically is a global minimum of some cost function. Unfortunately, however,
other stable solutions (e.g., local minima) may exist and provide suboptimal or
even wrong estimates. Here we demonstrate for a 9-dimensional Lorenz-96 model
how to characterize the basin size of the global minimum when applying some
particular optimization based estimation algorithm. We compare three different
strategies for generating suitable initial guesses and we investigate the
dependence of the solution on the given trajectory segment (underlying the
measured time series). To address the question of how many state variables have
to be measured for optimal performance, different types of multivariate time
series are considered consisting of 1, 2, or 3 variables. Based on these time
series the local observability of state variables and parameters of the
Lorenz-96 model is investigated and confirmed using delay coordinates. This
result is in good agreement with the observation that correct state and
parameter estimation results are obtained if the optimization algorithm is
initialized with initial guesses close to the true solution. In contrast,
initialization with other exact solutions of the model equations (different
from the true solution used to generate the time series) typically fails, i.e.
the optimization procedure ends up in local minima different from the true
solution. Initialization using random values in a box around the attractor
exhibits success rates depending on the number of observables and the available
time series (trajectory segment).

damping due to resonant interaction with the shear Alfv\'{e}n continuum. This
continuum damping can make a significant contribution to the overall
growth/decay rate of shear Alfv\'{e}n eigenmodes, with consequent implications
for fast ion transport. One method for calculating continuum damping is to
solve the MHD eigenvalue problem over a suitable contour in the complex plane,
thereby satisfying the causality condition. Such an approach can be implemented
in three-dimensional ideal MHD codes which use the Galerkin method. Analytic
functions can be fitted to numerical data for equilibrium quantities in order
to determine the value of these quantities along the complex contour. This
approach requires less resolution than the established technique of calculating
damping as resistivity vanishes and is thus more computationally efficient. The
complex contour method has been applied to the three-dimensional finite element
ideal MHD code CKA . In this paper we discuss the application of the complex
contour technique to calculate the continuum damping of global modes in tokamak
as well as torsatron, W7X and H1-NF stellarator cases. To the authors'
knowledge these stellarator calculations represent the first calculation of
continuum damping for eigenmodes in fully three-dimensional equilibria. The
continuum damping of global modes in W7X and H1-NF stellarator configurations

However, current postprocessing approaches are often univariate and apply to a

univariately postprocessed ensemble forecasts using dependence patterns from
past observations. Specifically, the observations are taken from historical

easy to use, visual-inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping approach
that leverages cost-efficient, paper printable artificial landmarks, socalled
fiducials. Results show that by fusing visual and inertial data, the system
provides accurate estimates and is robust against fast motions and changing
lighting conditions. Tight integration of the estimation of sensor and fiducial
pose as well as extrinsics ensures accuracy, map consistency and avoids the
requirement for precalibration. By providing an open source implementation and
various datasets, partially with ground truth information, we enable community
members to run, test, modify and extend the system either using these datasets
or directly running the system on their own robotic setups.

  Model of Physics Teacher Preparation",,,,,"physics.ed-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose the DHAC conceptual model of teacher preparation (Development of
Habits through Apprenticeship in a Community), which builds on the contemporary
literature on teacher preparation in physics and other disciplines and strives
to provide a better understanding of the process of teacher formation. Extant
literature on teacher preparation suggests that pre-service teachers learn best
when they are immersed in a community that allows them to develop dispositions,
knowledge, and practical skills and share with the community a strong vision of
what good teaching entails. However, despite having developed the requisite
dispositions, knowledge, and skills in pursuing the shared vision of good
teaching, the professional demands on a teacher's time are so great out of and
so complex during class time that if every decision requires multiple
considerations and deliberations with oneself, the productive decisions might
not materialize. We therefore argue that the missing link between intentional
decision-making and actual teaching practice are the teacher's habits
(spontaneous responses to situational cues). Teachers unavoidably develop
habits with practical experience and under the influence of knowledge and
belief structures that in many ways condition the responses of teachers in
their practical work. To steer new teachers away from developing unproductive
habits directed towards ""survival"" instead of student learning, we argue that
any teacher preparation program (e.g., physics) should strive to develop in
pre-service teachers strong habits of mind and practice that will serve as an
underlying support structure for beginning teachers. These habits form the core
of the conceptual model described in the paper. We provide examples of habits,
which physics teachers need to develop before starting teaching and propose
mechanisms for the development of such habits.

topological strings on toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. In this paper we develop in
detail this correspondence for mirror curves of higher genus, which display
many new features as compared to the genus one case studied so far. Given a
curve of genus g, our quantization scheme leads to g different trace class
operators. Their spectral properties are encoded in a generalized spectral
determinant, which is an entire function on the Calabi-Yau moduli space. We
conjecture an exact expression for this spectral determinant in terms of the
standard and refined topological string amplitudes. This conjecture provides a
non-perturbative definition of the topological string on these geometries, in
which the genus expansion emerges in a suitable 't Hooft limit of the spectral
traces of the operators. In contrast to what happens in quantum integrable
systems, our quantization scheme leads to a single quantization condition,
which is elegantly encoded by the vanishing of a quantum-deformed theta
function on the mirror curve. We illustrate our general theory by analyzing in
detail the resolved C3/Z5 orbifold, which is the simplest toric Calabi-Yau
manifold with a genus two mirror curve. By applying our conjecture to this
example, we find new quantization conditions for quantum mechanical operators,
in terms of genus two theta functions, as well as new number-theoretic
properties for the periods of this Calabi-Yau.

absorption parameter $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$. Multigrid approximations of
this equation with $\varepsilon \not= 0$ are commonly used as preconditioners
for the pure Helmholtz case ($\varepsilon = 0$). However a rigorous theory for
such (so-called ""shifted Laplace"") preconditioners, either for the pure
Helmholtz equation, or even the absorptive equation ($\varepsilon \not=0$), is
still missing. We present a new theory for the absorptive equation that
provides rates of convergence for (left- or right-) preconditioned GMRES, via
estimates of the norm and field of values of the preconditioned matrix. This
theory uses a $k$- and $\varepsilon$-explicit coercivity result for the
underlying sesquilinear form and shows, for example, that if $|\varepsilon|\sim
k^2$, then classical overlapping additive Schwarz will perform optimally for
the absorptive problem, provided the subdomain and coarse mesh diameters are
carefully chosen. Extensive numerical experiments are given that support the
theoretical results. The theory for the absorptive case gives insight into how
its domain decomposition approximations perform as preconditioners for the pure
Helmholtz case $\varepsilon = 0$. At the end of the paper we propose a

for the solution of the delay Lyapunov equation. Our method is based on the
fact that the delay Lyapunov equation can be expressed as a linear system of
equations, whose unknown is the value $U(\tau/2)\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$,
i.e., the delay Lyapunov matrix at time $\tau/2$. This linear matrix equation
with $n^2$ unknowns is solved by adapting a preconditioned iterative method
such as GMRES. The action of the $n^2\times n^2$ matrix associated to this
linear system can be computed by solving a coupled matrix initial-value
problem. A preconditioner for the iterative method is proposed based on solving
a T-Sylvester equation $MX+X^TN=C$, for which there are methods available in
the literature. We prove that the preconditioner is effective under certain
assumptions. The efficiency of the approach is illustrated by applying it to a
time-delay system stemmingfrom the discretization of a partial differential
equation with delay. Approximate solutions to this problem can be obtained for
problems of size up to $n\approx 1000$, i.e., a linear system with $n^2\approx

elementary fermions with different baryon or lepton number should stem from
different 27 representations of E_6. We present a six-dimensional orbifold GUT
model in which the E_6 gauge symmetry is broken to the SM gauge group so that
the appropriate splitting of the bulk 27-plets takes place. In this model the
strongly coupled sector is localised on one of the branes and possesses an
SU(6) global symmetry that contains the SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y
subgroup. In this case the approximate gauge coupling unification can be
attained if the right-handed top quark is a composite state and the elementary
sector involves extra exotic matter beyond the SM which ensures anomaly
cancellation. The breakdown of the approximate SU(6) symmetry at low energies
in this model results in a set of the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone states which
include a Higgs doublet and scalar colour triplet. We discuss the generation of
the masses of the SM fermions in the E6CHM. The presence of the TeV scale
vector-like exotic quarks and scalar colour triplet may provide spectacular new
physics signals that can be observed at the LHC.

is how to identify key nodes, for which purpose a number of centrality measures
have been developed. This paper proposes a new parametric family of centrality
measures called generalized degree. It is based on the idea that a relationship
to a more interconnected node contributes to centrality in a greater extent
than a connection to a less central one. Generalized degree improves on degree
by redistributing its sum over the network with the consideration of the global
structure. Application of the measure is supported by a set of basic
properties. A sufficient condition is given for generalized degree to be rank
monotonic, excluding counter-intuitive changes in the centrality ranking after
certain modifications of the network. The measure has a graph interpretation
and can be calculated iteratively. Generalized degree is recommended to apply
besides degree since it preserves most favourable attributes of degree, but
better reflects the role of the nodes in the network and has an increased
ability to distinguish among their importance.

spectral features originating in these regions. These denser atmospheric

coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Nevertheless, it was called in question recently
whether all two-ribbon flares are eruptive. In this paper, we investigate a two
ribbon-like white-light (WL) flare that is associated with a failed magnetic
flux rope (MFR) eruption on 2015 January 13, which has no accompanying CME in
the WL coronagraph. Observations by \textit{Optical and Near-infrared Solar
Eruption Tracer} and \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} reveal that, with the
increase of the flare emission and the acceleration of the unsuccessfully
erupting MFR, two isolated kernels appear at the WL 3600 {\AA} passband and
quickly develop into two elongated ribbon-like structures. The evolution of the
WL continuum enhancement is completely coincident in time with the variation of
\textit{Fermi} hard X-ray 26--50 keV flux. Increase of continuum emission is
also clearly visible at the whole FUV and NUV passbands observed by
\textit{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph}. Moreover, in one WL kernel, the
\ion{Si}{4}, \ion{C}{2}, and \ion{Mg}{2} h/k lines display significant
enhancement and non-thermal broadening. However, their Doppler velocity pattern
is location-dependent. At the strongly bright pixels, these lines exhibit a
blueshift; while at moderately bright ones, the lines are generally redshifted.
These results show that the failed MFR eruption is also able to produce a
two-ribbon flare and high-energy electrons that heat the lower atmosphere,
causing the enhancement of the WL and FUV/NUV continuum emissions and
chromospheric evaporation.

forcing ion species to stream through the neutral gas ahead of the shock front.
This magnetic precursor heats the gas sufficiently to create a large, warm

collide with ion species in a thin hot slab that closely resembles an ordinary
gas dynamic shock.

violates the Bell inequalities by violating Measurement Independence. Despite
this, IS theory is not fine tuned, is not conspiratorial, does not constrain

these claims are discussed in this paper. These arise from properties not found

the p-adic metric encapulates the physics of the Cosmological Invariant Set

when when $p$ is set equal to infinity. Since it is based around a top-down
constraint from cosmology, IS theory suggests that gravitational and quantum

minimal integral equations of elements of $B$ over $A$. It is an invariant that
lies in between ${\rm d}_K(L)$ and $\mu_A(B)$, the minimal number of generators
of the $A$-module $B$. Our purpose is to study this invariant. We prove that it
is sub-multiplicative and upper-semicontinuous in the following three cases: if
$A\subset B$ is simple; if $A\subset B$ is projective and finite and $K\subset
L$ is a simple algebraic field extension; or if $A$ is integrally closed.
Furthermore, ${\rm d}$ is semicontinuous if $A$ is noetherian of dimension $1$
and with finite integral closure. In general, however, ${\rm d}$ is neither
sub-multiplicative nor upper-semicontinuous.

with a proton is calculated using the conventional surface-integral formula
$J_{\textrm{surf}}[\varphi]$, the volume-integral formula of the
symmetry-adapted perturbation theory $J_{\textrm{SAPT}}[\varphi]$, and a
variational volume-integral formula $J_{\textrm{var}}[\varphi]$. The
calculations are based on the multipole expansion of the wave function
$\varphi$, which is divergent for any internuclear distance $R$. Nevertheless,
the resulting approximations to the leading coefficient $j_0$ in the large-$R$
asymptotic series $J(R) = 2 e^{-R-1} R ( j_0 + j_1 R^{-1} + j_2 R^{-2} +\cdots
) $ converge, with the rate corresponding to the convergence radii equal to 4,
2, and 1 when the $J_{\textrm{var}}[\varphi]$, $J_{\textrm{surf}}[\varphi]$,
and $J_{\textrm{SAPT}}[\varphi]$ formulas are used, respectively. Additionally,
we observe that also the higher $j_k$ coefficients are predicted correctly when
the multipole expansion is used in the $J_{\textrm{var}}[\varphi]$ and
$J_{\textrm{surf}}[\varphi]$ formulas. The SAPT formula
$J_{\textrm{SAPT}}[\varphi]$ predicts correctly only the first two
coefficients, $j_0$ and $j_1$, gives a wrong value of $j_2$, and diverges for
higher $j_n$. Since the variational volume-integral formula can be easily
generalized to many-electron systems and evaluated with standard basis-set
techniques of quantum chemistry, it provides an alternative for the
determination of the exchange splitting and the exchange contribution of the
interaction potential in general.

Schmeja et al. applied photometric filters to the 2MASS to find new cluster
candidates that were subsequently confirmed or rejected by the MWSC pipeline.
To further extend the MWSC census, we aimed at discovering new clusters by
conducting an almost global search in proper motion catalogues as a starting
point. METHODS: We first selected high-quality samples from the PPMXL and UCAC4
for comparison and verification of the proper motions. For 441 circular proper
motion bins (radius 15 mas/yr) within $\pm$50 mas/yr, the sky outside a thin
Galactic plane zone ($|b|$$<$5$^{\circ}$) was binned in small areas ('sky
pixels') of 0.25$\times$0.25 deg$^2$. Sky pixels with enhanced numbers of stars
with a certain common proper motion in both catalogues were considered as
cluster candidates. After visual inspection of the sky images, we built an
automated procedure that combined these representations of the sky for
neighbouring proper motion subsamples after a background correction. RESULTS:
About half of our 692 candidates overlapped with known clusters (46 globular
and 68 open clusters in the Galaxy, about 150 known clusters of galaxies) or
the Magellanic Clouds. About 10% of our candidates turned out to be 63 new open
clusters confirmed by the MWSC pipeline. They occupy predominantly the two
inner Galactic quadrants and have apparent sizes and numbers of high-probable
members slightly larger than those of the typically small MWSC clusters,
whereas their other parameters (ages, distances, tidal radii) fall in the
typical ranges. As our search aimed at finding compact clusters, we did not
find new very nearby (extended) clusters. (abridged)

show that the performance of the group is strongly affected by the strength of

for the multipartite GHZ states. However, the elegant GHZ argument for Bell's
nonlocality does not go through for bipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)

extraction of spin energy from a black hole endowed with a magnetic field
supported by electric currents in a surrounding disk (Blandford & Znajek 1977).
A generic feature of this mechanism is that, under certain fairly general
assumptions, the energy loss rate decays exponentially. In this work, we are
looking precisely for such exponential decay in the lightcurves of long
duration GRBs observed with the XRT instrument on the Swift satellite. We found
out that almost 30 % of XRT lightcurves show such behavior before they reach
the afterglow plateau. According to Blandford & Znajek, the duration of the
burst depends on the magnetic flux accumulated on the event horizon. This
allows us to estimate the surface magnetic field of a possible progenitor. Our
estimations are consistent with magnetic fields observed in Wolf-Rayet stars.

provide a formalism for modeling structured variation of visual features.
Conventionally, latent variables are de- fined on the variation of the
foreground (positive) class. In this work we augment LVMs to include negative
latent variables corresponding to the background class. We formalize the
scoring function of such a generalized LVM (GLVM). Then we discuss a framework
for learning a model based on the GLVM scoring function. We theoretically
showcase how some of the current visual recognition methods can benefit from
this generalization. Finally, we experiment on a generalized form of Deformable
Part Models with negative latent variables and show significant improvements on
two different detection tasks.

complicated cascade of association and dissociation steps, the great majority
of which cannot be directly experimentally observed. This has made capsid
assembly a rich field for computational models to attempt to fill the gaps in
what is experimentally observable. Nonetheless, accurate simulation predictions
depend on accurate models and there are substantial obstacles to model
inference for such systems. Here, we describe progress in learning parameters
for capsid assembly systems, particularly kinetic rate constants of coat-coat
interactions, by computationally fitting simulations to experimental data. We
previously developed an approach to learn rate parameters of coat-coat
interactions by minimizing the deviation between real and simulated light
scattering data monitoring bulk capsid assembly in vitro. This is a difficult
data-fitting problem, however, because of the high computational cost of
simulating assembly trajectories, the stochastic noise inherent to the models,
and the limited and noisy data available for fitting. Here we show that a newer
classes of methods, based on derivative-free optimization (DFO), can more
quickly and precisely learn physical parameters from static light scattering
data. We further explore how the advantages of the approaches might be affected
by alternative data sources through simulation of a model of time-resolved mass
spectrometry data, an alternative technology for monitoring bulk capsid
assembly that can be expected to provide much richer data. The results show
that advances in both the data and the algorithms can improve model inference,
with rich data leading to high-quality fits for all methods, but DFO methods
showing substantial advantages over less informative data sources better
representative of the current experimental practice.

However, in literature no work is specifically tailored to streams of graphs.
Motivated by the fact that the size of the feature space representation of many
state-of-the-art graph kernels is relatively small and thus it is explicitly
computable, we study whether executing kernel algorithms in the feature space
can be more effective than the classical dual approach. We study three

and efficacy of the proposed approaches are experimentally assessed on
relatively large graph streams exhibiting concept drift. It turns out that,
when strict memory budget constraints have to be enforced, working in feature

viable alternative to dual approaches, both in terms of speed and

recognition in still images. However, for action recognition in videos, the
improvement of deep convolutional networks is not so evident. We argue that
there are two reasons that could probably explain this result. First the
current network architectures (e.g. Two-stream ConvNets) are relatively shallow
compared with those very deep models in image domain (e.g. VGGNet, GoogLeNet),
and therefore their modeling capacity is constrained by their depth. Second,
probably more importantly, the training dataset of action recognition is
extremely small compared with the ImageNet dataset, and thus it will be easy to
over-fit on the training dataset.
  To address these issues, this report presents very deep two-stream ConvNets
for action recognition, by adapting recent very deep architectures into video
domain. However, this extension is not easy as the size of action recognition
is quite small. We design several good practices for the training of very deep
two-stream ConvNets, namely (i) pre-training for both spatial and temporal
nets, (ii) smaller learning rates, (iii) more data augmentation techniques,
(iv) high drop out ratio. Meanwhile, we extend the Caffe toolbox into Multi-GPU
implementation with high computational efficiency and low memory consumption.
We verify the performance of very deep two-stream ConvNets on the dataset of
UCF101 and it achieves the recognition accuracy of $91.4\%$.

This implies that the $D$-term is an inherent part of corresponding generalized

their host galaxies, as long as we can assume them to be fragile structures
that are disrupted during merger events. In this work we investigate the
fragility of NSDs by means of N-body simulations reproducing the last phases of
a galaxy encounter, when the nuclear regions of the two galaxies merge. For
this, we exposed a NSD set in the gravitational potential of the bulge and
supermassive black hole of a primary galaxy to the impact of the supermassive
black hole from a secondary galaxy. We explored merger events of different mass
ratios, from major mergers with a 1:1 mass ratio to intermediate and minor
interactions with 1:5 and 1:10 ratios, while considering various impact
geometries. We analyse the end results of such mergers from different viewing
angles and looked for possible photometric and kinematic signatures of the
presence of a disc in the remnant surface density and velocity maps, while
adopting detection limits from real observations. Our simulations show that
indeed NSDs are fragile against major mergers, which leave little trace of NSDs
both in images and velocity maps, while signatures of a disc can be found in
the majority of the intermediate to minor-merger remnants and in particular

pulsations in the lightcurves of solar flares. Their periods and damping times
play an important role in seismologically diagnosing key parameters like the
magnetic field strength in regions where flare energy is released. Usually such
applications are based on theoretical results neglecting unresolved fine
structures in magnetized loops. However, the existence of fine structuring is
suggested on both theoretical and observational grounds. Adopting the framework
of cold magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we model coronal loops as magnetized
cylinders with a transverse equilibrium density profile comprising a monolithic
part and a modulation due to fine structuring in the form of concentric shells.
The equation governing the transverse velocity perturbation is solved with an
initial-value-problem approach, and the effects of fine structuring on the
periods $P$ and damping times $\tau$ of global, leaky, standing sausage modes
are examined. A parameter study shows that fine structuring, be it periodically
or randomly distributed, brings changes of only a few percent to $P$ and $\tau$
when there are more than about ten shells. The monolithic part, its steepness
in particular, plays a far more important role in determining $P$ and $\tau$.
We conclude that when measured values of $P$ and $\tau$ of sausage modes are
used for seismological purposes, it is justified to use theoretical results
where the effects due to fine structuring are neglected.

computational methods to rapidly compute the correlated random velocities of
Brownian particles. In the overdamped limit where both particle and fluid
inertia are ignored, one must also account for a Brownian drift term in order
to successfully update the particle positions. In this paper, we present an
efficient computational method for the dynamic simulation of Brownian
suspensions with fluctuating hydrodynamics that handles both computations and
provides a similar approximation as Stokesian Dynamics for dilute and
semidilute suspensions. This advancement relies on combining the fluctuating
force-coupling method (FCM) with a new midpoint time-integration scheme we
refer to as the drifter-corrector (DC). The DC resolves the drift term for
fluctuating hydrodynamics-based methods at a minimal computational cost when
constraints are imposed on the fluid flow to obtain the stresslet corrections
to the particle hydrodynamic interactions. With the DC, this constraint need
only be imposed once per time step, reducing the simulation cost to nearly that
of a completely deterministic simulation. By performing a series of
simulations, we show that the DC with fluctuating FCM is an effective and
versatile approach as it reproduces both the equilibrium distribution and the

types of substructures. However, in some cases they have similar predictive
performances, probably because the substructures can be interpreted as
approximations of the subgraphs they induce. In this paper, we propose to
associate to each feature a piece of information about the context in which the
feature appears in the graph. A substructure appearing in two different graphs
will match only if it appears with the same context in both graphs. We propose
a kernel based on this idea that considers trees as substructures, and where
the contexts are features too. The kernel is inspired from the framework in
[6], even if it is not part of it. We give an efficient algorithm for computing
the kernel and show promising results on real-world graph classification

towards the positions of embedded massive star formation. We have identified a
total of 115 distinct clumps, approximately two-thirds of which are associated

others are classified as quiescent. There is a strong spatial correlation
between the peak NH3 emission and the presence of embedded objects. We derive
the spatial distribution of the kinetic gas temperatures, line widths, and
NH$_3$ column densities from these maps, and by combining these data with dust
emission maps we estimate clump masses, H$_2$ column densities and ammonia
abundances. The clumps have typical masses of ~1000 Msun and radii ~0.5 pc,
line widths of ~2 km/s and kinetic temperatures of ~16-20 K. We find no
significant difference between the sizes and masses of the star forming and
quiescent subsamples; however, the distribution maps reveal the presence of
temperature and line width gradients peaking towards the centre for the star
forming clumps while the quiescent clumps show relatively uniform temperatures
and line widths throughout. Virial analysis suggests that the vast majority of
clumps are gravitationally bound and are likely to be in a state of global free
fall in the absence of strong magnetic fields. The similarities between the
properties of the two subsamples suggest that the quiescent clumps are also
likely to form massive stars in the future, and therefore provide a excellent
opportunity to study the initial conditions of massive pre-stellar and
protostellar clumps.

is widely used in science and engineering. A plethora of algorithms have been
developed to tackle NMF, but due to the non-convex nature of the problem, there
is little guarantee on how well these methods work. Recently a surge of
research have focused on a very restricted class of NMFs, called separable NMF,
where provably correct algorithms have been developed. In this paper, we
propose the notion of subset-separable NMF, which substantially generalizes the
property of separability. We show that subset-separability is a natural
necessary condition for the factorization to be unique or to have minimum
volume. We developed the Face-Intersect algorithm which provably and
efficiently solves subset-separable NMF under natural conditions, and we prove
that our algorithm is robust to small noise. We explored the performance of
Face-Intersect on simulations and discuss settings where it empirically
outperformed the state-of-art methods. Our work is a step towards finding
provably correct algorithms that solve large classes of NMF problems.

of cellular networks reside at the edge between two cells; these users
typically receive poor service as a result of the relatively weak signal and
strong interference. Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) with Joint Transmission
(JT) is a cellular networking technique allowing multiple Base Stations (BSs)
to jointly transmit to a single user. This improves the users' reception
quality and facilitates better service to cell-edge users. We consider a
CoMP-enabled network, comprised of multiple BSs interconnected via a backhaul
network. We formulate the OFDMA Joint Scheduling (OJS) problem of determining a
subframe schedule and deciding if and how to use JT in order to maximize some
utility function. We show that the OJS problem is NP-hard. We develop optimal
and approximation algorithms for specific and general topologies, respectively.
We consider a time dimension and study a queueing model with packet arrivals in
which the service rates for each subframe are obtained by solving the OJS
problem. We prove that when the problem is formulated with a specific utility
function and solved optimally in each subframe, the resulting scheduling policy
is throughput-optimal. Via extensive simulations we show that the bulk of the
gains from CoMP with JT can be achieved with low capacity backhaul. Moreover,
our algorithms distribute the network resources evenly, increasing the
inter-cell users' throughput at only a slight cost to the intra-cell users.
This is the first step towards a rigorous, network-level understanding of the
impact of cross-layer scheduling algorithms on CoMP networks.

account for some amount of the radiation we observe today, in addition to the
possibility of explaining the present speed up of the universe. We start
introducing and reviewing cosmological reconstruction methods for metric $f(R)$
theories of gravity that can be considered as one of the straightforward
modifications of Einstein's gravity as soon as $f(R)\neq R$. We then take into
account two possible $f(R)$ models which could give rise to (dark) radiation.
Constraints on the models are found by using the Planck Collaboration 2015 data
within a cosmographic approach and by obtaining the matter power spectrum of
those models. The conclusion is that $f(R)$ gravity can only contribute
minimally to the (dark) radiation to avoid departures from the observed matter
power spectrum at the smallest scales (of the order of $0.01$Mpc$^{-1}$), i.e.,
precisely those scales that exited the horizon at the radiation dominated
epoch. This result could strongly contribute to select reliable $f(R)$ models.

force gives the system a momentum transverse in the direction to the
displacement. We show that Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in long channels
with vortices exhibit a quantization of the current response with respect to
the spatial vortex distribution. The quantization originates from the
well-known topological property of the phase around a vortex --- it is an
integer multiple of $ 2 \pi $. In a similar way to the integer quantum Hall
effect, the current along the channel is related to this topological phase, and
can be extracted from two experimentally measurable quantities: the total
momentum of the BEC and the spatial distribution. The quantization is in units
of $ m/2h $, where $ m $ is the mass of the atoms and $ h $ is Planck's
constant. We derive an exact vortex momentum-displacement relation for BECs in
long channels under general circumstances. Our results presents the possibility
that the configuration described here can be used as a novel way of measuring
the mass of the atoms in the BEC using a topological invariant of the system.
If an accurate determination of the plateaus are experimentally possible, this
gives the possibility of a topological quantum mass standard and precise
determination of the fine structure constant.

that the linearly-solvable row sum (score), generalized row sum, and least
squares methods have favourable axiomatic properties.
  Two chess team European championships are analysed as case studies. Final
rankings are compared by their distances and visualized with multidimensional
scaling (MDS). Differences to the official ranking are revealed by the
decomposition of the least squares method. Rankings are evaluated by prediction
power, retrodictive performance, and stability. The paper argues for the use of
least squares method with a results matrix favouring match points on the basis
of its relative insensitivity to the choice between match and board points,
retrodictive accuracy, and robustness.
