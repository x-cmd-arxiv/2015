exact reasoning about qualitative preferences in popular ceteris paribus
preference languages such as CP-nets, TCP-nets, CP-theories, etc. The tool uses
a model checking engine to translate preference specifications and queries into
appropriate Kripke models and verifiable properties over them respectively. The
distinguishing features of the tool are: (1) exact and provably correct query
answering for testing dominance, consistency with respect to a preference
specification, and testing equivalence and subsumption of two sets of
preferences; (2) automatic generation of proofs evidencing the correctness of
answer produced by CRISNER to any of the above queries; (3) XML inputs and
outputs that make it portable and pluggable into other applications. We also
describe the extensible architecture of CRISNER, which can be extended to new
reference formalisms based on ceteris paribus semantics that may be developed
in the future.

superconducting orders that may occur in graphene-like systems, assuming
dominant nearest-neighbor attraction: the gapless hidden superconducting order,
which renormalizes the Fermi velocity, and the Kekule order, which opens a
superconducting gap. We perform an analysis within the mean-field theory for
Dirac electrons, at finite-temperature and finite chemical potential, as well
as at half filling and zero-temperature, first excluding the possibility of the
coexistence of the two orders. In that case, we find the dependence of the
critical (more precisely, crossover) temperature and the critical interaction
on the chemical potential. As a result of this analysis, we find that the
Kekule order is preferred over the hidden order at both finite temperature and
finite chemical potential. However, when the coexistence of the two
superconducting orders is allowed, using the coupled mean-field gap equations,
we find that above a critical value of the attractive interaction a mixed phase
sets in, in which these orders coexist. We show that the critical value of the
interaction for this transition is greater than the critical coupling for the
hidden superconducting state in the absence of the Kekule order, implying that
there is a region in the phase diagram where the Kekule order is favored as a
result of the competition with the hidden superconducting order. The latter,
however, eventually sets in and coexists with the Kekule state. According to
our mean-field calculations, the transition from the Kekule to the mixed phase
is of the second order, but it may become first order when fluctuations are
considered. Finally, we investigate whether these phases could be possible in
honeycomb superlattices of self-assembled semiconducting nanocrystals, which

optimization in statistics, signal processing and machine learning. A
well-known class of MC methods are Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.
In order to foster better exploration of the state space, specially in
high-dimensional applications, several schemes employing multiple parallel MCMC
chains have been recently introduced. In this work, we describe a novel
parallel interacting MCMC scheme, called {\it orthogonal MCMC} (O-MCMC), where
a set of ""vertical"" parallel MCMC chains share information using some
""horizontal"" MCMC techniques working on the entire population of current
states. More specifically, the vertical chains are led by random-walk
proposals, whereas the horizontal MCMC techniques employ independent proposals,
thus allowing an efficient combination of global exploration and local
approximation. The interaction is contained in these horizontal iterations.
Within the analysis of different implementations of O-MCMC, novel schemes in
order to reduce the overall computational cost of parallel multiple try
Metropolis (MTM) chains are also presented. Furthermore, a modified version of
O-MCMC for optimization is provided by considering parallel simulated annealing
(SA) algorithms. Numerical results show the advantages of the proposed sampling
scheme in terms of efficiency in the estimation, as well as robustness in terms
of independence with respect to initial values and the choice of the
parameters.

However from the radiation reaction formula, while the component of the

radiative losses, the parallel component does not undergo any change during
radiation. Therefore there is a change in the ratio of the two components,
implying a change in the pitch angle. We derive the exact formula for the
change in energy of radiating electrons by taking into account the change of

kinematic data for a population of tracer stars. The Jeans equation in the
$z$-direction is integrated to yield an equation that gives the velocity
dispersion as a function of the total mass density, tracer density, and the
tilt term that describes the coupling of vertical and radial motions. We then
fit a dark matter mass profile to tracer density and velocity dispersion data
to derive credible regions on the vertical dark matter density profile. Our
method avoids numerical differentiation, leading to lower numerical noise, and
is able to deal with the tilt term while remaining one dimensional. In this
study we present the method and perform initial tests on idealised mock data.
We also demonstrate the importance of dealing with the tilt term for tracers
that sample $\gtrsim 1$ kpc above the disc plane. If ignored, this results in a
systematic underestimation of the dark matter density.

unsupervised scheme, an unsupervised ensemble model (UnsEnM) by iteratively

94, 173602 (2005)], by measuring the output-state entanglement for a balanced
lossless beam splitter, one can quantify the input-state nonclassicality. These
measures of nonclassicality (referred to as entanglement potentials) can be
based, in principle, on various entanglement measures, leading to the
negativity (NP) and concurrence (CP) potentials, and the potential for the
relative entropy of entanglement (REEP). We search for the maximal
nonclassicality, which can be achieved by comparing two entanglement measures
for arbitrary two-qubit states and those which can be generated from a
photon-number qubit via a balanced lossless beam-splitter, where the qubit
basis states are the vacuum and single-photon states. Surprisingly, we find
that the maximal nonclassicality, measured by the REEP for a given value of the
NP, can be increased (if NP<0.527) by using either a tunable beam splitter or
by amplitude damping of the output state of the balanced beam splitter. We also
show that the maximal nonclassicality, measured by the NP for a given value of
the REEP, can be increased by dephasing. The entanglement itself is not
increased by these local losses, but the possible ratios of different measures
are affected. Moreover, we show that partially-mixed states can be more
nonclassical than both pure states and completely-mixed states, by comparing
the NP for a given value of the REEP. This implies that not all entanglement
measures can be used as entanglement potentials. Alternatively, a single
balanced lossless beam splitter is not always transferring the whole
nonclassicality of its input state into the entanglement of its output modes.
Applying a lossy beam splitter can solve this problem at least for the cases
analyzed in this paper.

architecture for integrated photonics to control the propagation of light on a

quantum photonic networks operating at the single photon level come within
reach. Towards large-scale quantum photonic networks, selective dynamic control
of individual components and deterministic interactions between different
constituents are of paramount importance. This indeed calls for switching
speeds ultimately on the system's native timescales. For example, manipulation
via electric fields or all-optical means have been employed for switching in
nanophotonic circuits and cavity quantum electrodynamics studies. Here, we
demonstrate dynamic control of the coherent interaction between two coupled
photonic crystal nanocavities forming a photonic molecule. By using an
electrically generated radio frequency surface acoustic wave we achieve
optomechanical tuning, demonstrate operating speeds more than three orders of
magnitude faster than resonant mechanical approaches. Moreover, the tuning
range is large enough to compensate for the inherent fabrication-related cavity
mode detuning. Our findings open a route towards nanomechanically gated

the substrates of the two films induce similar anchoring influences on the long
axes of the liquid crystal molecules (viz. planar orientation at one end and
perpendicular, or homeotropic, orientations at the other), they differ in their
coupling with the minor axes of the molecules. In Type-A film the substrates do
not interact with the minor axes at all (which is experimentally relatively
more amenable), while in Type-B, the orientations of the molecular axes at the
surface layer are influenced as well by their biaxial coupling with the
surface. Both films exhibit expected bending of the director associated with
ordering of the molecular long axes due to surface anchoring. Simulation
results indicate that the Type-A film hosts stable and noise free director
structures in the biaxial nematic phase of the LC medium, resulting from
dominant ordering of one of the minor axes in the plane of the substrates. High
degree of this stable order thus developed could be of practical interest for
in-plane switching applications with an external field. Type-B film, on the
other hand, experiences competing interactions among the minor axes, due to
incompatible anchoring influences at the bounding substrates, apparently
leading to frustration, and hence to noisy equilibrium director structures.

become an indispensable tool for statistical inference in many fields of

approach suitable even for models of very high dimensionality. We further
derive that for linear models, a one dimensional combination of statistics per

we demonstrate that our method readily scales to models of very high

effective population size, the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations

lack of pre-packaged options for model fitting makes it difficult to compare
new methodology in nonstationary modeling with other existing methods, and as a
result most new models are simply compared to stationary models. Using a
convolution-based approach, we present a new nonstationary covariance function
for spatial Gaussian process models that allows for efficient computing in two
ways: first, by representing the spatially-varying parameters via a discrete
mixture or ""mixture component"" model, and second, by estimating the mixture
component parameters through a local likelihood approach. In order to make
computation for a convolution-based nonstationary spatial model readily

The nonstationary model is fit to both a synthetic data set and a real data

the package.

factor-of-two uncertainty in the modeling of the relevant nuclear matrix
elements, it will be possible to measure the total mass itself, the effective
Majorana mass and the effective electron mass with an accuracy (at 95\% C.L.)

magnetosphere via the X-ray emission produced by magnetically confined wind
shocks. Our main findings are:
  (i) The observed spectrum of NGC 1624-2 is hard, similar to the magnetic
O-type star Theta 1 Ori C, with only a few photons detected below 0.8 keV. The
emergent X-ray flux is 30% lower at the Halpha minimum phase.
  (ii) Our modelling indicated that this seemingly hard spectrum is in fact a
consequence of relatively soft intrinsic emission, similar to other magnetic
Of?p stars, combined with a large amount of local absorption (~1-3 x 10^22
cm^-2). This combination is necessary to reproduce both the prominent Mg and Si
spectral features, and the lack of flux at low energies. NGC 1624-2 is
intrinsically luminous in X-rays (log LX emission ~ 33.4) but 70-95% of the
X-ray emission produced by magnetically confined wind shocks is absorbed before
it escapes the magnetosphere (log LX ISM corrected ~ 32.5).
  (iii) The high X-ray luminosity, its variation with stellar rotation, and its
large attenuation are all consistent with a large dynamical magnetosphere with
magnetically confined wind shocks.

coherent mode representation of the cross spectral density matrix the two

of correlation properties from modern coherence theory are demonstrated to be
preserved under parametric down-conversion. Based on the generalised Siegert
relations and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality a measure of entanglement for the
two photon amplitude is proposed. Upper bounds for this measure are found in
terms of the \emph{golden ratio} for maximally entangled states. Two
inequalities are derived for the two photon amplitude for which there exist a
transition zone from super-Poisson statistics to sub-Poisson statistics for

upper bounds in a theoretically consistent manner can affect the allowed
parameter space of a DM model. Traditionally, the limits from DM direct
detection experiments on the elastic scattering cross section of DM particles
as a function of their mass are extracted under simplifying assumptions.
Relaxing the assumptions related to the DM particle nature, such as the neutron
to proton ratio of the interactions, or the possibility of having similar
contributions from the spin independent (SI) and spin dependent (SD)
interactions can vary significantly the upper limits. Furthermore, it is known
that astrophysical and nuclear uncertainties can also affect the upper bounds.
To exemplify the impact of properly including all these factors, we have
analysed two well motivated and popular DM scenarios: neutralinos in the NMSSM
and a Z' portal with Dirac DM. We have found that the allowed parameter space
of these models is subject to important variations when one includes both the
SI and SD interactions at the same time, realistic neutron to proton ratios, as
well as using different self-consistent speed distributions corresponding to
popular DM halo density profiles, and distinct SD structure functions. Finally,
we provide all the necessary information to include the upper bounds of
SuperCDMS and LUX taking into account all these subtleties in the investigation
of any particle physics model. The data for each experiment and example codes

disk lies at the heart of many questions posed by neutron stars in X-ray
binaries. We consider the opening of stellar magnetic flux due to differential
rotation along field lines coupling the star and disk, using a simple model for
the disk-opened flux, the torques exerted on the star by the magnetosphere, and
the power extracted by the electromagnetic wind. We examine the conditions
under which the system enters an equilibrium spin state, in which the accretion
torque is instantaneously balanced by the pulsar wind torque alone. For
magnetic moments, spin frequencies, and accretion rates relevant to accreting
millisecond pulsars, the spin-down torque from this enhanced pulsar wind can be
substantially larger than that predicted by existing models of the
disk-magnetosphere interaction, and is in principle capable of maintaining spin
equilibrium at frequencies less than 1 kHz. We speculate that this mechanism
may account for the non-detection of frequency increases during outbursts of
SAX J1808.4-3658 and XTE J1814-338, and may be generally responsible for
preventing spin-up to sub-millisecond periods. If the pulsar wind is collimated
by the surrounding environment, the resulting jet can satisfy the power
requirements of the highly relativistic outflows from Cir X-1 and Sco X-1. In
this framework, the jet power scales relatively weakly with accretion rate, L_j
~ Mdot^{4/7}, and would be suppressed at high accretion rates only if the
stellar magnetic moment is sufficiently low.

The theories we consider are the holographic duals to Einstein gravity coupled
to a scalar with an exponential potential. The coefficient in the exponent,
$X$, is the parameter that controls the deviation from the conformally
invariant case. For these models we obtain analytic solutions for the plasma
expansion in the late-time limit, under the assumption of boost-invariance, and
we determine the scaling behaviour of the energy density, pressure, and
temperature as a function of time. We find that the temperature decays as a
function of proper time as $T\sim \tau^{-s/4}$ with $s$ determined in terms of
the non-conformality parameter $X$ as $s=4(1-4X^2)/3$. This agrees with the
result of Janik and Peschanski, $s=4/3$, for the conformal plasmas and
generalizes it to non-conformal plasmas with $X\neq 0$. We also consider more
realistic potentials where the exponential is supplemented by power-law terms.
Even though in this case we cannot have exact solutions, we are able under

governed by turbulent, magnetized accretion disks. Understanding their secular
dynamics is of primary importance. Apart from enabling mass accretion via the
transport of angular momentum, the turbulence affects the long-term evolution
of the embedded magnetic flux, which in turn regulates the efficiency of the
transport. In this paper, we take a comprehensive next step towards an
effective mean-field model for turbulent astrophysical disks by systematically
studying the key properties of magnetorotational turbulence in
vertically-stratified, isothermal shearing boxes. This allows us to infer
emergent properties of the ensuing chaotic flow as a function of the shear
parameter as well as the amount of net-vertical flux. Using the test-field
method, we furthermore characterize the mean-field dynamo coefficients that
describe the long-term evolution of large-scale fields. We simultaneously infer
the vertical shape and the spectral scale dependence of these closure
coefficients, with the latter describing non-local contributions to the
turbulent electromotive force. Based on this, we infer a scale-separation ratio
of about ten for the large-scale dynamo. We finally determine scaling
properties of the mean-field dynamo coefficients. The relevant component of the
dynamo {\alpha} effect is found to scale linearly with the shear rate, as is
the corresponding turbulent diffusion, {\eta}. Together, these scalings allow
us to predict, in a quantitative manner, the cycle period of the well-known
butterfly diagram. This lends new support to the importance of the
{\alpha}{\Omega} mechanism in determining the evolution of large-scale magnetic
fields in turbulent accretion disks.

the narrow sense heritability explained by common single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) via linear mixed model approaches became widely used. As
in most GWASs, most of the heritability analyses are performed using univariate
approaches i.e. considering each phenotype independently. In this study, we
propose a Bayesian matrix-variate mixed model that takes into account the
genetic correlation between phenotypes in addition to the genetic correlation
between individuals which is usually modelled via a relatedness matrix. We
showed that when the relatedness matrix is estimated using all the genome-wide
SNPs, our model is equivalent to a matrix normal regression with matrix normal
prior on the effect sizes. Using real data we demonstrate that there is a boost
in the heritability explained when phenotypes are jointly modelled (25-35%
increase). In fact based on their standard error, the joint modelling provides
more accurate estimates of the heritability over the univariate modelling.
Moreover, our Bayesian approach provides slightly higher estimates of
heritability compared to the maximum likelihood method. On the other hand,
although our method performs less well in phenotype prediction, we note that an
initial imputation step relatively increases the prediction accuracy.

proposed \cite{Graham:2015cka}, where the hierarchy between weak scale physics
and any putative `cutoff' $M$ is translated into a parametrically large field
excursion for the so-called relaxion field, driving the Higgs mass to values
much less than $M$ through cosmological dynamics. In its simplest incarnation,
the relaxion mechanism requires nothing beyond the standard model other than an
axion (the relaxion field) and an inflaton. In this note, we critically
re-examine the requirements for successfully realizing the relaxion mechanism
and point out that parametrically larger field excursions can be obtained for a
given number of e-folds by simply requiring that the background break exact de
Sitter invariance. We discuss several corollaries of this observation,
including the interplay between the upper bound on the scale $M$ and the order
parameter $\epsilon$ associated with the breaking of dS symmetry, and entertain
the possibility that the relaxion could play the role of a curvaton. We find
that a successful realization of the mechanism is possible with as few as
$\mathcal O (10^3)$ e-foldings, albeit with a reduced cutoff $M \sim 10^6$ GeV
for a dark QCD axion and outline a minimal scenario that can be made consistent
with CMB observations.

important way of deriving the thermodynamical properties of black holes.
However, there are certain black hole models and some mathematically analog
mechanical models for which this method cannot be applied directly. This is due
to the fact that their action evaluated on a classical solution is not finite
and its first variation does not vanish for all consistent boundary conditions.
These problems can be dealt with by adding a counterterm to the classical
action, which is a solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
  In this work we study the effects of polymer quantization on a mechanical
model presenting the aforementioned difficulties and contrast it with the above
counterterm method. This type of quantization for mechanical models is
motivated by the loop quantization of gravity which is known to play a role in
the thermodynamics of black hole systems.
  The model we consider is a nonrelativistic particle in an inverse square
potential, and analyze two polarizations of the polymer quantization in which
either the position or the momentum is discrete. In the former case, Thiemann's
regularization is applied to represent the inverse power potential but we still
need to incorporate the Hamilton-Jacobi counterterm which is now modified by
polymer corrections. In the latter, momentum discrete case however, such
regularization could not be implemented. Yet, remarkably, owing to the fact
that the position is bounded, we do not need a Hamilton-Jacobi counterterm in
order to have a well-defined saddle point approximation. Further developments
and extensions are commented upon in the discussion.

that large structures contain smaller substructures. These subhalos will
enhance signatures of dark matter annihilation such as gamma rays. In the
literature, typical estimates of this boost factor assume a concentration-mass
relation for field halos, to calculate the luminosity of subhalos. However,
since subhalos accreted in the gravitational potential of their host loose mass
through tidal stripping and dynamical friction, they have a quite
characteristic density profile, different from that of the field halos of the
same mass. In this work, we quantify the effect of tidal stripping on the boost
factor, by developing a semi-analytic model that combines mass-accretion
history of both the host and subhalos as well as subhalo accretion rates. We
find that when subhalo luminosities are treated consistently, the boost factor
increases by a factor 2-5, compared to the typical calculation assuming a
field-halo concentration. This holds for host halos ranging from sub-galaxy to
cluster masses and is independent of the subhalo mass function or specific
concentration-mass relation. The results are particularly relevant for indirect
dark matter searches in the extragalactic gamma-ray sky.

It forms a perfect bare action giving the same renormalised trajectory. A bare

Milky Way Galaxy, presumably formed from the tidal disruption of globular
clusters. In integrable potentials---where all orbits are regular---tidal
debris phase-mixes close to the orbit of the progenitor system. However, the
Milky Way's dark matter halo is expected not to be fully integrable; an
appreciable fraction of orbits will be chaotic. This paper examines the
influence of chaos on the phase-space morphology of cold tidal streams. Streams
even in weakly chaotic regions look very different from those in regular
regions. We find that streams can be sensitive to chaos on a much shorter
time-scale than any standard prediction (from the Lyapunov or
frequency-diffusion times). For example, on a weakly chaotic orbit with a
chaotic timescale predicted to be $>$1000 orbital periods ($>$1000 Gyr), the
resulting stellar stream is, after just a few 10's of orbits, substantially
more diffuse than any formed on a nearby but regular orbit. We find that the
enhanced diffusion of the stream stars can be understood by looking at the
variance in orbital frequencies of orbit ensembles centered around the parent
(progenitor) orbit. Our results suggest that long, cold streams around our
Galaxy must exist only on regular (or very nearly regular) orbits; they
potentially provide a map of the regular regions of the Milky Way potential.
This suggests a promising new direction for the use of tidal streams to
constrain the distribution of dark matter around our Galaxy.

Unlike in other studies, Jupiter-mass planets are found to have their
eccentricities amplified --- provided their orbits start eccentric. We
disentangle the web of co-rotation, co-orbital, and external resonances to show
that this finite-amplitude instability is consistent with that predicted
analytically. Ellipticities can grow until they reach of order the disk's
aspect ratio, beyond which the external Lindblad resonances that excite
eccentricity are weakened by the planet's increasingly supersonic epicyclic
motion. Forcing the planet to still larger eccentricities causes catastrophic
eccentricity damping as the planet collides into gap walls. For standard
parameters, the range of eccentricities for instability is modest; the
threshold eccentricity for growth ($\sim$$0.04$) is not much smaller than the
final eccentricity to which orbits grow ($\sim$$0.07$). If this threshold
eccentricity can be lowered (perhaps by non-barotropic effects), and if the
eccentricity driving documented here survives in 3D, it may robustly explain

gas-to-stellar mass ratios (G/S) from galaxy colors and optional additional

finding that axial ratio is the best independent and physically meaningful
third parameter. We define a ""modified color"" from planar fits to G/S as a
function of both color and axial ratio. In the complete galaxy population,
upper limits on G/S bias linear and planar fits. We therefore model the entire
PGF probability density field, enabling iterative statistical modeling of upper

sensitivity for $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ by the NA62 experiment at CERN and for
$K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ by the KOTO experiment at J-PARC, we study them in the
simplest extensions of the SM in which stringent correlations between these two
decays and other flavour observables are present. We first consider simple
models with tree-level Z and Z' contributions in which either MFV or a $U(2)^3$
symmetry is imposed on the quark flavour-violating couplings. We then compare
the resulting correlations with those present in generic models in which the
latter couplings are arbitrary, subject to constraints from $\Delta F=2$
processes, electroweak and collider data. Of particular interest are the
correlations with $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ and $K_L\to\mu^+\mu^-$ which limit the
size of NP contributions to $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ and
$K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$, depending on the Dirac structure of couplings and the
relevant operators. But in MFV also the constraint from $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$
turns out to be important. We take into account the recent results from lattice
QCD and large N approach that indicate $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ in the SM to be
significantly below the data. While in many models the enhancement of
$\epsilon'/\epsilon$ implies a suppression of $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$, we

union of the $g$ and the $r$ filters, achieving an intrinsic photometric
dispersion of $0.05$ mag, and a systematic error of $0.05$ mag in the
zero-point. Since some detectors of the camera show significant non-linearity,
we use a linear correlation to fit the zero-points as a function of the
instrumental magnitudes, thus obtaining a good correction to the non-linear
behavior of these detectors. We obtain good photometry to an equivalent
limiting magnitude of $r\sim 20.5$. Studying the optical variability of X-ray
detected sources in the XMM-COSMOS field, we find that the survey is

general effective model. The use of a novel sum rule allows us to express the
band edge shift current in terms of a few model parameters and to show it
depends explicitly on wavefunctions via Berry connections in addition to
standard band structure. We use our approach to identify two new classes of
shift current photovoltaics, ferroelectric polymer films and single-layer
orthorhombic monochalcogenides such as GeS. We introduce tight-binding models
for these systems, and show that they exhibit the largest shift current
responsivities at the band edge reported so far. Moreover, exploring the
parameter space of these models we find photoresponsivities that can exceed
$100$ mA/W. Our results show how the study of the shift current via effective

imbalance and within the mean-field approximation, the non-adiabatic evolution
of the pairing amplitude in a collisionless regime can be found exactly by

given by $W_{n,j}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i=1}^nX_{ij}$, where the $X_{ij}$ are
independent. In particular, provided $g$ satisfies certain differentiability
and growth rate conditions, we obtain an order $n^{-(p-1)/2}$ bound, for smooth
test functions, if the first $p$ moments of the $X_{ij}$ agree with those of
the normal distribution. If $p$ is an even integer and $g$ is an even function,
this convergence rate can be improved further to order $n^{-p/2}$. These
convergence rates are shown to be of optimal order. We apply our general bounds
to some examples, which include the distributional approximation of
asymptotically chi-square distributed statistics; the approximation of
expectations of smooth functions of binomial and Poisson random variables;
rates of convergence in the delta method; and a quantitative variance-gamma
approximation of the $D_2^*$ statistic for alignment-free sequence comparison
in the case of binary sequences.

-- formerly relegated within the literature since the introduction of outward

including no outliers, dispersed outliers (the classical slippage alternative),
and clustered outliers (a case seldom considered). We advocate a density
mixture approach for detecting clustered outliers. Tests are found to be highly
sensitive to the correct specification of the main distribution
(Exponential/Pareto), exposing high potential for errors in inference. Further,
in five case studies -- financial crashes, nuclear power generation accidents,
stock market returns, epidemic fatalities, and cities within countries --
significant outliers are detected and related to the concept of ""Dragon King""

  We employ a recently developed microscopic approach, based on the
Boltzmann-Langevin transport equation, to investigate the role of mean-field
dynamics and phase-space fluctuations in these reactions.
  We find that the formation of few IMF's can be confused with asymmetric
fission when relying on yield observables, but it can not be assimilated to the
statistical decay of a compound nucleus when analysing the dynamics and
kinematic observables: it can be described as a fragmentation process initiated
by phase-space fluctuations, and successively frustrated by the mean-field
resilience. As an extreme situation, which corresponds to non-negligible
probability, the number of fragments in the exit channel reduces to two, so
that fission-like events are obtained by re-aggregation processes.
  This interpretation, inspired by nuclear-spallation experiments, can be
generalised to heavy-ion collisions from Fermi to relativistic energies, for
situations when the system is closely approaching the fragmentation threshold.

us to compute the transition amplitude between arbitrary initial and final

Consequently, the tasks assignment to workers is performed not only based on
the current location of the human workers and the tasks available in the
region, but also based on the availability of the workers during the specific
times that a given task should be accepted, processed, and completed. Having
the system determine the daily pattern of the workers (either by predefined
questionnaires when the workers register, or by archiving data from the
worker's mobile devices, or by on the road and real-time entered status data)
eliminates many unsuccessful task assignments and therefore significantly
increases the efficiency of the system. In the original Spatial Crowdsourcing
(SC) framework, the SC-server optimizes the task assignment locally at every
instance of time and whenever a new task, or a new worker, enters the system.
Our new framework (PSC), on the other hand, allows the users to enter their
daily routine, and temporal, spatial, and availability patterns a priori. This
makes the system much more stable and pattern-opportunistic. The PSC servers
can focus on receiving and archiving new entries (e.g., workers, tasks, and
their criteria) during busy times (e.g., when there are many new entries in the
system), and can focus on optimization and computations during quiet times
(e.g., when there are fewer new entries in the system). Having the task
optimization process happen during quiet times, and when there are few changes
to the system, makes the performance more stable and reliable. It also allows
the PSC system to have a global view of the system and and perform global
optimizations to improve the performance.

  In particular, we demonstrate the strength of our techniques by exhibiting a
lower bound of $2-\frac{1}{m}$ for the scheduling problem with unrelated
machines (formulated as a mechanism design problem in the seminal paper of
Nisan and Ronen on Algorithmic Mechanism Design). Our lower bound applies to
truthful randomized mechanisms (disregarding any computational assumptions on
the running time of these mechanisms). Moreover, it holds even for the weaker
notion of truthfulness for randomized mechanisms -- i.e., truthfulness in
expectation. This lower bound nearly matches the known $\frac{7}{4}$
(randomized) truthful upper bound for the case of two machines (a non-truthful
FPTAS exists). No lower bound for truthful randomized mechanisms in
multi-parameter settings was previously known.

  category of spaces",,,,,"math.AT math.CT math.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In [BaSc2], the author and Tomer Schlank introduced a much weaker homotopical
structure than a model category, which we called a ""weak cofibration category"".
We further showed that a small weak cofibration category induces in a natural
way a model category structure on its indcategory, provided the ind-category
satisfies a certain two out of three property. The main purpose of this paper
is to give sufficient intrinsic conditions on a weak cofibration category for
this two out of three property to hold. We consider an application to the
category of compact metrizable spaces, and thus obtain a model structure on its
ind-category. This model structure is defined on a category that is closely
related to a category of topological spaces and has many convenient formal
properties. A more general application of these results, to the (opposite)
category of separable $C^*$-algebras, appears in a paper by the author, Michael
Joachim and Snigdhayan Mahanta [BJM].

relating the dark matter density field to the expected halo or galaxy field.
Coherent redshift-space distortions are corrected in a Gibbs-sampling procedure
by moving the galaxies from redshift-space to real-space according to the
peculiar motions derived from the recovered density field using linear theory
with the option to include tidal field corrections from second order Lagrangian
perturbation theory. The virialised distortions are corrected by sampling
candidate real-space positions (being in the neighbourhood of the observations
along the line of sight), which are compatible with the bulk flow corrected
redshift-space position adding a random dispersion term in high density
collapsed regions. The latter are defined according to the eigenvalues of the
Hessian. This approach presents an alternative method to estimate the distances
to galaxies using the three dimensional spatial information, and assuming
isotropy. Hence the number of applications is very broad. In this work we show
the potential of this method to constrain the growth rate up to $k$ ~ 0.3 $h$

errors, and to obtain improved BAO reconstructions.

problem of interest. Classical work with smaller dimensional problems dating
back to Huber and Bickel has illustrated the benefits of efficient loss
functions. When the number of parameters $p$ is of the same order as the sample
size $n$, $p \approx n$, an efficiency pattern different from the one of Huber
was recently established. In this work, we consider the effects of model
selection on the estimation efficiency of penalized methods. In particular, we
explore whether sparsity, results in new efficiency patterns when $p > n$. In
the interest of deriving the asymptotic mean squared error for regularized
M-estimators, we use the powerful framework of approximate message passing. We
propose a novel, robust and sparse approximate message passing algorithm
(RAMP), that is adaptive to the error distribution. Our algorithm includes many
non-quadratic and non-differentiable loss functions. We derive its asymptotic
mean squared error and show its convergence, while allowing $p, n, s \to
\infty$, with $n/p \in (0,1)$ and $n/s \in (1,\infty)$. We identify new
patterns of relative efficiency regarding a number of penalized $M$ estimators,
when $p$ is much larger than $n$. We show that the classical information bound
is no longer reachable, even for light--tailed error distributions. We show
that the penalized least absolute deviation estimator dominates the penalized
least square estimator, in cases of heavy--tailed distributions. We observe
this pattern for all choices of the number of non-zero parameters $s$, both $s
\leq n$ and $s \approx n$. In non-penalized problems where $s =p \approx n$,
the opposite regime holds. Therefore, we discover that the presence of model

allocations for traffic engineering, current literature mostly focuses on
unicast communications. Compared to traffic engineering for multiple unicast
flows, multicast traffic engineering for multiple trees is very challenging not
only because minimizing the bandwidth consumption of a single multicast tree by
solving the Steiner tree problem is already NP-Hard, but the Steiner tree
problem does not consider the link capacity constraint for multicast flows and
node capacity constraint to store the forwarding entries in Group Table of
OpenFlow. In this paper, therefore, we first study the hardness results of
scalable multicast traffic engineering in SDN. We prove that scalable multicast
traffic engineering with only the node capacity constraint is NP-Hard and not
approximable within, which is the number of destinations in the largest
multicast group. We then prove that scalable multicast traffic engineering with
both the node and link capacity constraints is NP-Hard and not approximable
within any ratio. To solve the problem, we design an approximation algorithm,
named Multi-Tree Routing and State Assignment Algorithm (MTRSA), for the first
case and extend it to the general multicast traffic engineering problem. The
simulation and implementation results demonstrate that the solutions obtained
by the proposed algorithm outperform the shortest-path trees and Steiner trees.
Most importantly, MTRSA is computation-efficient and can be deployed in SDN
since it can generate the solution with numerous trees in a short time.

flowing through the visual system. In the neuronal hierarchy, the response
properties of single neurons are determined by neurons located one level below,
and in turn, determine the responses of neurons located one level above.
Therefore in modeling receptive fields, it is essential to ensure that the
response properties of neurons in a given level can be generated by combining
the response models of neurons in its input levels. However, existing response
models of neurons in the motion cortex do not inherently yield the temporal
frequency filtering gradient (TFFG) property that is known to emerge along the
primary visual cortex (V1) to middle temporal (MT) motion processing stream.
TFFG is the change from predominantly lowpass to predominantly bandpass
temporal frequency filtering character along the V1 to MT pathway (Foster et al
1985; DeAngelis et al 1993; Hawken et al 1996). We devised a new model, the
sinc wavelet model (Odaibo, 2014), which logically and efficiently generates
the TFFG. The model replaces the Gabor function's sine wave carrier with a sinc
(sin(x)/x) function, and has the same or fewer number of parameters as existing
models. Because of its logical consistency with the emergent network property
of TFFG, we conclude that the sinc wavelet is a better model for the receptive
fields of motion cortex neurons. This model will provide new physiological
insights into how the brain represents visual information.

properties resembling conditions in galaxy clusters. The flow is driven to
turbulence Mach number $\mathcal{M}_t \sim 1/2$ in an isothermal medium with an
initially very weak, uniform seed magnetic field ($\beta = P_g/P_B = 10^6$).
Since cluster turbulence is likely to result from a mix of sheared (solenoidal)
and compressive forcing processes, we examine the distinct turbulence
properties for both cases. In one set of simulations velocity forcing is
entirely solenoidal ($\nabla\cdot \delta {\vec u} = 0$), while in the other it
is entirely compressive ($\nabla\times \delta {\vec u} = 0$). Both cases
develop a mixture of solenoidal and compressive turbulent motions, since each
generates the other. The development of compressive turbulent motions leads to
shocks, even when the turbulence is solenoidally forced and subsonic. Shocks,
in turn, produce and amplify vorticity, which is especially important in
compressively forced turbulence. To clarify those processes we include a pair
of appendices that look in detail at vorticity evolution in association with
shocks. From our simulation analyses we find that magnetic fields amplified to
near saturation levels in predominantly solenoidal turbulence can actually
enhance vorticity on small scales by concentrating and stabilizing shear. The
properties, evolution rates and relative contributions of the kinetic and
magnetic turbulent elements depend strongly on the character of the forcing.
Specifically, shocks are stronger, but vorticity evolution and magnetic field
amplification are slower and weaker when the turbulence is compressively
forced. We identify a simple relation to estimate characteristic shock
strengths in terms of the turbulence Mach number and the character of the
forcing. Our results will be helpful in understanding flow motions in galaxy
clusters.

variable annuities with Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) is an
optimal stochastic control problem. The surrender feature available in marketed
products allows termination of the contract before maturity, making it also an
optimal stopping problem. Although the surrender feature is quite common in
variable annuity contracts, there appears to be no published analysis and
results for this feature in GMWB under optimal policyholder behaviour - results
found in the literature so far are consistent with the absence of such a
feature. Also, it is of practical interest to see how the much simpler
bang-bang strategy, although not optimal for GMWB, compares with optimal GMWB
strategy with surrender option.
  In this paper we extend our recently developed algorithm (Luo and Shevchenko
2015a) to include surrender option in GMWB and compare prices under different
policyholder strategies: optimal, static and bang-bang. Results indicate that
following a simple but sub-optimal bang-bang strategy does not lead to
significant reduction in the price or equivalently in the fee, in comparison
with the optimal strategy. We observed that the extra value added by the
surrender option could add very significant value to the GMWB contract. We also
performed calculations for static withdrawal with surrender option, which is
the same as bang-bang minus the ""no-withdrawal"" choice. We find that the fee
for such contract is only less than 1% smaller when compared to the case of
bang-bang strategy, meaning that th ""no-withdrawal"" option adds little value to
the contract.

the remaining level of Sgr B2 emission is still decreasing or has reached a

explained by XRN while a constant background emission can be best explained by
LECRp. In the XRN scenario, the 3-79 keV Sgr B2 spectrum can well constrain the

$\Gamma_{\rm QTCP}/J_1=4.10(5)$. We also show that the critical exponents of
the QTCP are identical to those of the MF theory because the QTCP in this model
is in the upper critical dimension. The QMC simulations reveal that
unconventional proximity effects of the ferromagnetic susceptibility appear
close to the antiferromagnetic QTCP, and the proximity effects survive for the
conventional quantum critical point. We suggest that the momentum dependence of

formulated by Knowles in 1976 and analytical solutions in general nonlinear
elasticity proposed by Gao since 1998. Based on minimum potential principle, a
well-determined fully nonlinear system is obtained for isochoric deformation,
which admits non-trivial states of finite anti-plane shear without ellipticity
constraint. By using canonical duality theory, a complete set of analytical
solutions are obtained for 3-D finite deformation problems governed by
generalized neo-Hookean model. Both global and local extremal solutions to the
nonconvex variational problem are identified by a triality theory. Connection
between challenges in nonconvex analysis and NP-hard problems in computational
science is revealed. It is proved that the ellipticity condition for general
fully nonlinear boundary value problems depends not only on differential
operators, but also sensitively on the external force field. The homogenous
hyper-elasticity for general anti-plane shear deformation must be governed by
the generalized neo-Hookean model. Knowles' over-determined system is simply
due to a pseudo-Lagrange multiplier and two extra equilibrium conditions in the
plane. The constitutive condition in his theorems is naturally satisfied with
$b = \lambda/2$. His ellipticity condition is neither necessary nor sufficient
for general homogeneous materials to admit nontrivial states of anti-plane
shear.

consider the inverse problem of decomposing the data matrix into its

Omitting the internal degrees of freedom (such as spins) of the physical rulers

frame is described by a bosonic non-linear sigma model (NLSM). We study the
quantum behavior of the system under approximations, and obtain (1) a
cosmological constant valued $(2/\pi)\rho_{c0}$ ($\rho_{c0}$ the critical
density at near current epoch) which is very close to the observations; (2) an
effective Einstein-Hilbert term; (3) the ratio of variance to mean-squared of
spacetime interval tends to a universal constant $2/\pi$ in the infrared
region. This effect is testable by observing a linear dependence between the
inherent quantum variance and mean-squared of the redshifts from cosmic distant
spectral lines. The proportionality is expected to be the observed percentage
of the dark energy. The equivalence principle is also generalized to the

demonstrate that the Fourier transform of the LDOS close to the Dirac points

demonstrate that such junctions are generally spin active, namely, they can
rotate the spin so that an incident electron which is spin polarized along some

of spin transport as the length of the ferromagnet increases; this is analogous
to the decaying behavior of superfluid spin transport but contrasts with the
exponential decay of magnon spin transport. We envision that similar spin
transport with algebraic decay may be implemented in materials with exotic spin
phases by exploiting topological characteristics and the associated conserved
quantities of their excitations.

technology today including applications such as catalysis, solar energy
harvesting, and energy storage. In many of these applications, the details of
their electronic structure near the Fermi level are critically important for
their properties. We propose a first-principles based computational methodology
for the accurate prediction of oxygen charge transfer in TM oxides and lithium
TM (Li-TM) oxides. To obtain accurate electronic structures, the
Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional is adopted and the amount of
exact Hartree-Fock exchange (mixing parameter) is adjusted to reproduce
reference band gaps. We show that the HSE06 functional with optimal mixing
parameter yields not only improved electronic densities of states but also
better energetics (Li-intercalation voltages) for LiCoO2 and LiNiO2 as compared
to GGA, GGA+U and standard HSE06. We find that the optimal mixing parameters
for TM oxides are system-specific and correlate with the covalency (ionicity)
of the TM species. Strong covalent (ionic) nature of TM-O bonding leads to
lower (higher) optimal mixing parameters. We find that optimized HSE06
functionals predict stronger hybridization of the Co 3d and O 2p orbitals than
GGA, resulting in a greater contribution from oxygen states to charge
compensation upon delithiation in LiCoO2. We also find that the band gaps of
Li-TM oxides increase linearly with the mixing parameter, enabling the
straightforward determination of optimal mixing parameters based on GGA
({\alpha} = 0.0) and HSE06 ({\alpha} = 0.25) calculations. Our results also
show that G0W0@GGA+U band gaps of TM oxides (MO, M = Mn, Co, Ni) and LiCoO2
agree well with experimental references, suggesting that G0W0 calculations can
be used as a reference for the calibration of the mixing parameter in case no
experimental band gap has been reported.

N_{H}, T_{d}, n_{H}, and G_{0}. By computing the mass of the cores and
comparing it to the Bonnor-Ebert mass, we determined that 29 of the 34 cores
are gravitationally unstable and undergoing collapse. In fact, we found that 6
cores are associated with at least one young stellar object, suggestive of
their proto-stellar nature. By investigating the physical conditions within
each core, we can shed light on the cm emission revealed (or not) by our CARMA
observations. Indeed, we find that only 3 of our cores have any significant
detectable cm emission. Using a spinning dust model, we predict the expected
level of spinning dust emission in each core and find that for all 34 cores,
the predicted level of emission is larger than the observed cm emission
constrained by the CARMA observations. Moreover, even in the cores for which we
do detect cm emission, we cannot, at this stage, discriminate between free-free
emission from young stellar objects and spinning dust emission. We emphasise
that, although the CARMA observations described in this analysis place
important constraints on the presence of spinning dust in cold, dense
environments, the source sample targeted by these observations is not
statistically representative of the entire population of Galactic cores.

microscopic model for a two-level atom interacting with the quantized EM field

Due to the two fold degeneracy of the ring cavity modes, the Rabi splitting
exhibits three rather than two resonant frequency peaks. We find that the
heights of the two side peaks show a sensitive linear dependence on the
rotating velocity. This high sensitivity can be utilized to detect the angular
velocity of the whole system.

Fellows et. al. (Discrete Optimization, 2011).
  In this paper, we give an improved kernel of $O(k^3)$ vertices for
Diamond-free Edge Deletion. Further, we give an $O(k^2)$ vertex kernel for a

NP-complete even for $K_4$-free graphs and can be solved neither in
subexponential time (i.e., $2^{o(|G|)}$) nor in parameterized subexponential

reliability, and reduce hydrocarbon emissions, there is a strong need to deploy
energy storage systems (ESSs), which can provide a control medium for peak hour
utility operations. ESSs are especially desired at the residential level, as
this sector has the most untapped demand response potential. However,
considering their high acquisition, operation, and maintenance costs,
individual ESS deployment is not economically viable. Hence, in this paper, we
propose a \emph{sharing-based} ESS architecture, in which the demand of each
customer is modeled stochastically and the aggregate demand is accommodated by
a combination of power drawn from the grid and the storage unit when the demand
exceeds grid capacity. Stochastic framework for analyzing the optimal size of
energy storage systems is provided. An analytical method is developed for a
group customers with \emph{single} type of appliances. Then, this framework is
extended to any network size with arbitrary number of customers and appliance
types. The analytical method provides a tractable solution to the ESS sizing
problem. Finally, a detailed cost-benefit analysis is provided, and the results
indicate that sharing-based ESSs are practical and significant savings in terms
of ESS size can be achieved.

deformable 3-dimensional bodies (referred as homogeneous deformations). They
preserve parallelism and are often used as an approximation to general

interface modeled by a surface, the parallelism is defined by the affine
connection of this surface. In this work we study the infinitesimally affine
time - dependent deformations (motions) after establishing formulas for the
variation of the connection, but in the more general context of hypersurfaces
of a Riemannian manifold. We prove certain equivalent formulas expressing the
variation of the connection in terms of geometrical quantities related to the
variation of the metric, as expected, or in terms of mechanical quantities
related to the kinematics of the moving continuum. The latter is achieved using
an adapted version of polar decomposition theorem, frequently used in continuum
mechanics to analyze the motion. Also, we apply our results to special motions
like tangential and normal motions. Further, we find necessary and sufficient
conditions for this variation to be zero (infinitesimal affine motions), giving
insight on the form of the motions and the kind of hypersurfaces that allow
such motions. Finally, we give some specific examples of mechanical interest

the slope of the initial mass function, or the fraction of white dwarfs with
hydrogen deficient atmospheres. We present a population synthesis study of the
white dwarf population of NGC 6397. In particular, we study the shape of the
color-magnitude diagram, and the corresponding magnitude and color
distributions. We do this using an up-to-date Monte Carlo code that
incorporates the most recent and reliable cooling sequences and an accurate
modeling of the observational biases. We find a good agreement between our
theoretical models and the observed data. In particular, we find that this
agreement is best for those cooling sequences that take into account residual
hydrogen burning. This result has important consequences for the evolution of
progenitor stars during the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase,
since it implies that appreciable third dredge-up in low-mass, low-metallicity
progenitors is not expected to occur. Using a standard burst duration of 1.0
Gyr, we obtain that the age of the cluster is 12.8+0.50-0.75 Gyr. Larger ages
are also compatible with the observed data, but then realistic longer durations
of the initial burst of star formation are needed to fit the luminosity
function. We conclude that a correct modeling of the white dwarf opulation of
globular clusters, used in combination with the number counts of main sequence

significantly smaller eccentricities than the eccentricities corresponding to

protoplanets that have migrated from outer region is considered, it is usually
considered that eccentricities of the merged bodies become comparable to those
of orbital crossing bodies, which are excited up to their escape eccentricities
by close scattering. However, the eccentricity evolution in the {\it in situ}
accretion model has not been studied in detail. Here, we investigate the
eccentricity evolution through {\it N}-body simulations. We have found that the
merged planets tend to have much smaller eccentricities than the escape
eccentricities due to very efficient collision damping. If the protoplanet
orbits are initially well separated and their eccentricities are securely
increased, an inner protoplanet collides at its apocenter with an outer
protoplanet at its pericenter. The eccentricity of the merged body is the
smallest for such configuration. Orbital inclinations are also damped by this
mechanism and planets tend to share a same orbital plane, which is consistent
with {\it Kepler} data. Such efficient collision damping is not found when we
start calculations from densely packed orbits of the protoplanets. If the
protoplanets are initially in the mean-motion resonances, which corresponds to
well separated orbits, the {\it in situ} accretion model well reproduces the
features of eccentricities and inclinations of multiple super-Earths/Earth

of Things (IIoT) advancement in the process control and manufacturing industry.
The emergence of IIoT opens great potential for the ubiquitous field device
connectivity and manageability with an integrated and standardized architecture
from low-level device operations to high-level data-centric application
interactions. This technological development requires software definability in
the key architectural elements of IIoT, including wireless field devices, IIoT
gateways, network infrastructure, and IIoT sensor cloud services. In this
paper, a novel software-defined IIoT (SD-IIoT) is proposed in order to solve
essential challenges in a holistic IIoT system, such as reliability, security,
timeliness scalability, and quality of service (QoS). A new IIoT system
architecture is proposed based on the latest networking technologies such as
WirelessHART, WebSocket, IETF constrained application protocol (CoAP) and
software-defined networking (SDN). A new scheme based on CoAP and SDN is
proposed to solve the QoS issues. Computer experiments in a case study are
implemented to show the effectiveness of the proposed system architecture.

insulating configurations which evolve into a trivial state with increasing
tensile strain or on-site Coulomb potential U. However, LDA+U calculations show
a stable antiferromagnetic solution for the $5d^8$ case at every U value, which
would break time reversal symmetry and could affect the topological properties
of the system. We also discuss the similarities with the buckled honeycomb

Initio Laser Theory (SALT), which is also built on a spectral method but makes
a more specific ansatz about the long-time dynamical evolution of the

only a narrow regime of pump powers the inversion is not stationary, and that
this, as pump power is further increased, triggers a synchronization transition
upon which the inversion becomes stationary again. We provide a detailed

CH3NH3PbI3 (alpha = 3.8 x 10^4 cm-1 at 2.0 eV) are comparable to those of
CuInGaSe2 and CdTe, and high alpha values reported in earlier studies are
overestimated seriously by extensive surface roughness of CH3NH3PbI3 layers.
The polarization-dependent DFT calculations show that CH3NH3+ interacts
strongly with the PbI3- cage, modifying the CH3NH3PbI3 dielectric function in
the visible region rather significantly. When the effect of CH3NH3+ on the
optical transition is eliminated in the DFT calculation, CH3NH3PbI3 dielectric
function deduced from DFT shows excellent agreement with the experimental
result. As a result, distinct optical transitions observed at E0 (Eg) = 1.61
eV, E1 = 2.53 eV, and E2 = 3.24 eV in CH3NH3PbI3 are attributed to the direct
semiconductor-type transitions at the R, M, and X points in the pseudo-cubic
Brillouin zone, respectively. We further perform the quantum efficiency (QE)
analysis for a standard hybrid-perovskite solar cell incorporating a mesoporous
TiO2 layer and demonstrate that the QE spectrum can be reproduced almost

even the recent and advanced PDP solutions that do deal with dynamic data, do
so in a limited manner, and for only the latest version of the data. A naive

tremendous overheads, and is undesirable. In this paper, we present algorithms
to achieve full persistence (all intermediate configurations are preserved and
are modifiable) for an optimized skip list (known as FlexList) so that
versioned data can be audited. The proposed scheme provides deduplication at
the level of logical, variable sized blocks, such that only the altered parts
of the different versions are kept, while the persistent data-structure
facilitates access (read) of any arbitrary version with the same storage and
process efficiency that state-of-the-art dynamic PDP solutions provide for only

upper bound of the loss function is approximated by the sparse codes and the
linear function parameter. To optimize this problem, we develop an iterative

quantum factoring. For general scalability, though, a different approach has to

Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) that are relevant to the 2015 release of the
Planck cosmological results, showing the robustness and consistency of our data
set, especially for polarization analysis. We use two complementary approaches:
(i) simulations based on measured data and physical models of the known
systematic effects; and (ii) analysis of difference maps containing the same
sky signal (""null-maps""). The LFI temperature data are limited by instrumental
noise. At large angular scales the systematic effects are below the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) temperature power spectrum by several orders of
magnitude. In polarization the systematic uncertainties are dominated by
calibration uncertainties and compete with the CMB $E$-modes in the multipole
range 10--20. Based on our model of all known systematic effects, we show that
these effects introduce a slight bias of around $0.2\,\sigma$ on the
reionization optical depth derived from the 70\,GHz $EE$ spectrum using the 30
and 353\,GHz channels as foreground templates. At 30\,GHz the systematic
effects are smaller than the Galactic foreground at all scales in temperature
and polarization, which allows us to consider this channel as a reliable
template of synchrotron emission. We assess the residual uncertainties due to
LFI effects on CMB maps and power spectra after component separation and show
that these effects are smaller than the CMB amplitude at all scales. We also
assess the impact on non-Gaussianity studies and find it to be negligible. Some
residuals still appear in null maps from particular sky survey pairs,
particularly at 30 GHz, suggesting possible straylight contamination due to an
imperfect knowledge of the beam far sidelobes.

connection to classical Markovian stochastic processes. Moreover, it is shown
that similar mathematical representations as those found for the original trace
distance based measure hold true for the associated, generalized measure for
quantum non-Markovianity. That is, we prove orthogonality of optimal states
showing a maximal information backflow and establish a local and universal
representation of the measure. We illustrate some properties of the generalized
criterion by means of examples.

probability distribution functions (PDFs) for three high-mass star-forming
regions (CepOB3, MonR2, NGC6334), obtained from dust emission observed with
Herschel. The low column density range can be fit with a lognormal
distribution. A first power-law tail starts above an extinction (Av) of ~6-14.
It has a slope of alpha=1.3-2 for the rho~r^-alpha profile for an equivalent
density distribution (spherical or cylindrical geometry), and is thus
consistent with free-fall gravitational collapse. Above Av~40, 60, and 140, we
detect an excess that can be fitted by a flatter power law tail with alpha>2.
It correlates with the central regions of the cloud (ridges/hubs) of size ~1 pc
and densities above 10^4 cm^-3. This excess may be caused by physical processes
that slow down collapse and reduce the flow of mass towards higher densities.
Possible are: 1. rotation, which introduces an angular momentum barrier, 2.
increasing optical depth and weaker cooling, 3. magnetic fields, 4. geometrical
effects, and 5. protostellar feedback. The excess/second power-law tail is
closely linked to high-mass star-formation though it does not imply a universal
column density threshold for the formation of (high-mass) stars.

We prove that $o(\mathcal S, \hat \mu)$ is related to a conditional entropy of

probabilities, the contractions of an IFS with overlaps $\mathcal S_\lambda$.
We prove that for all $\lambda \in (\frac 12, 1)$, there exists a relation

advertisers, is complicated as they rely exclusively on the detection
mechanisms deployed by video hosting portals. In this context, the development
of independent tools able to monitor and audit the fidelity of these systems
are missing today and needed by both industry and regulators.
  In this paper we present a first set of tools to serve this purpose. Using
our tools, we evaluate the performance of the audit systems of five major
online video portals. Our results reveal that YouTube's detection system
significantly outperforms all the others. Despite this, a systematic evaluation
indicates that it may still be susceptible to simple attacks. Furthermore, we
find that YouTube penalizes its videos' public and monetized view counters
differently, the former being more aggressive. This means that views identified
as fake and discounted from the public view counter are still monetized. We
speculate that even though YouTube's policy puts in lots of effort to
compensate users after an attack is discovered, this practice places the burden
of the risk on the advertisers, who pay to get their ads displayed.

software-based computer systems and IT services. However, software very often
changes and there are no strong regulations for software. These facts are main
two challenges to be addressed in software assurance cases. We propose a
development method of assurance cases by means of continuous revision at every
stage of the system lifecycle, including in-operation and service recovery in
failure cases. The quality of dependability arguments are improved by multiple
stakeholders who check with each other. This paper reported our experience of
the proposed method in a case of the ASPEN education service. The case study
demonstrate that the continuos updates create a significant amount of active
risk communications between stakeholders. This gives us a promising perspective
for the long-term improvement of service dependability with the lifecycle

activities, particularly of solar flares. Here, we develop a method to
construct thermodynamic spectrum (TDS) charts based on the EVE spectral lines.
This tool could be potentially useful to the EUV astronomy to learn the
eruptive activities on the distant astronomical objects. Through several cases,
we illustrate what we can learn from the TDS charts. Furthermore, we apply the
TDS method to 74 flares equal to or greater than M5.0-class, and reach the
following statistical results. First, EUV peaks are always behind the soft
X-ray (SXR) peaks and stronger flares tend to have a faster cooling rate. There
is a power law correlation between the peak delay times and the cooling rates,
suggesting a coherent cooling process of flares from SXR to EUV emissions.
Second, there are two distinct temperature drift patterns, called Type I and
Type II. For Type I flares, the enhanced emission drifts from high to low
temperature like a quadrilateral, whereas for Type II flares, the drift pattern
looks like a triangle. Statistical analysis suggests that Type II flares are
more impulsive than Type I flares. Third, for late-phase flares, the peak
intensity ratio of the late phase to the main phase is roughly correlated with
the flare class, and the flares with a strong late phase are all confined. We
believe that the re-deposition of the energy carried by a flux rope, that
unsuccessfully erupts out, into thermal emissions is responsible for the strong
late phase found in a confined flare. Besides, with some cases we illustrate
the signatures of the flare thermodynamic process in the chromosphere and
transition region in TDS charts. These results provide new clues to advance our
understanding of the thermodynamic processes of solar flares and associated
solar eruptions, e.g., coronal mass ejections.

all-dielectric metamaterials and introduce the concept of a phase diagram and
an order parameter for such structured materials, based on the physics of Mie
and Bragg resonances. We show that a periodic photonic structure transforms
into a metamaterial when the Mie gap opens up below the lowest Bragg bandgap
where the homogenization approach can be justified and the effective
permeability becomes negative. Our theoretical approach is confirmed by
detailed microwave experiments for a metacrystal composed of a square lattice
of glass tubes filled with heated water. This analysis yields deep insight into
the properties of periodic photonic structures, and it also provides a useful
tool for designing different classes of electromagnetic materials in a broad

paper, we report a modeling of the millimeter-wave polarization of the HL Tau

have a power-law size distribution. We change the maximum grain size with a
fixed dust composition in a fixed disk model to find the grain size to
reproduce the observed signature. We find that the direction of the
polarization vectors and the polarization degree can be explained with the
self-scattering. Moreover, the polarization degree can be explained only if the
maximum grain size is $\sim 150 {\rm~\mu m}$. The obtained grain size from the
polarization is different from a size of millimeter or larger that has been
previously expected from the spectral index of the dust opacity coefficient if
the emission is optically thin. We discuss that porous dust aggregates may
solve the inconsistency of the maximum grain size between the two constraints.

the standard Lennard-Jones interaction potential that is truncated at a finite
cut-off distance, as is typical of many computer simulations. We demonstrate
that the discontinuity at the cut-off distance in the first derivative of the
potential (corresponding to the interparticle force) leads to the appearance of
cut-off nonlinearities. These cut-off nonlinearities persist into the
very-low-temperature regime thereby affecting low-temperature thermal
vibrations, which leads to a breakdown of the harmonic approximation for many
eigen modes, particularly for low-frequency vibrational modes. Furthermore,
while expansion nonlinearities which are due to higher order terms in the
Taylor expansion of the interaction potential are usually ignored at low
temperatures and show up as the temperature increases, cut-off nonlinearities
can become most significant at the lowest temperatures. Anharmonic effects
readily show up in the elastic moduli which not only depend on the eigen
frequencies, but are crucially sensitive to the eigen vectors of the normal
modes. Whereas, those observables that rely mainly on static structural
information or just the eigen frequencies, such as the vibrational density of
states, total potential energy, and specific heat, show negligible dependence
on the presence of the cut-off. Similar aspects of nonlinear behavior have
recently been reported in model granular materials, where the constituent
particles interact through finite-range, purely-repulsive potentials. These
nonlinearities have been ascribed to the nature of the sudden cut-off at
contact in the force-law, thus we demonstrate that cut-off nonlinearities
emerge as a general feature of ordered and disordered solid state systems
interacting through truncated potentials.

With the use of an electric-field induced by a gate electrode, the molecule is

decoding with a certain order. Then, we establish the effective capacity region

maximize the effective capacity region. As for the decoding order at the

channel fading parameters for given power allocation policies. In order to
accomplish the aforementioned objectives, we make use of the relationship
between the minimum mean square error and the first derivative of the mutual

results, we display the impact of input signal distributions on the effective

distribution on a barrier represented as the unit line segment $[0,1]$. The
sensors have identical sensing radius, say $r$. When a sensor is displaced on
the line a distance equal to $d$ it consumes energy (in movement) which is
proportional to some (fixed) power $a > 0$ of the distance $d$ traveled. The
energy consumption of a system of $n$ sensors thus displaced is defined as the
sum of the energy consumptions for the displacement of the individual sensors.
  We focus on the problem of energy efficient displacement of the sensors so
that in their final placement the sensor system ensures coverage of the barrier
and the energy consumed for the displacement of the sensors to these final
positions is minimized in expectation. In particular, we analyze the problem of
displacing the sensors from their initial positions so as to attain coverage of
the unit interval and derive trade-offs for this displacement as a function of
the sensor range. We obtain several tight bounds in this setting thus
generalizing several of the results of [10] to any power $a >0$.

potentially low cost and renewable energy solution based on the future hydrogen

suitably chosen catalyst dramatically improves efficiency of the hydrogen
production driven by direct sunlight and allows it to happen even at zero
driving potential. Here, we suggest a new class of stable photo-catalysts and
the corresponding principle for catalytic water splitting in which infrared and
visible light play the main role in producing the photocurrent and hydrogen.
The new class of catalysts based on ionic binary metals with layered
graphite-like structures which effectively absorb visible and infrared light
facilitating the reaction of water splitting, suppress the inverse reaction of
ion recombination by separating ions due to internal electric fields existing
near alternating layers, provide the sites for ion trapping of both polarities,
and finally deliver the electrons and holes required to generate hydrogen and
oxygen gases. As an example, we demonstrate conversion efficiency of 27 percent
at bias voltage bias 0.5 V for magnesium di-boride working as a catalyst for
photo-induced water splitting. We discuss its advantages over some existing
materials and propose the underlying mechanism of photo-catalytic water
splitting by binary layered metals.

Because the computation of the Turing patterns is time consuming for different

using the discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM) with SIPG discretization. Due
to the local nature of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, the nonlinear

factors (TFs) and their cis promoters are assumed to be sufficient to direct
the development of organisms. Mutations in GRNs are assumed to be the primary
drivers for the evolution of multicellular life. Here it is proven that neither
of these assumptions is correct. They are inconsistent with fundamental
principles of combinatorics of bounded encoded networks. It is shown there are
inherent complexity and control capacity limits for any gene regulatory network
that is based solely on protein coding genes such as transcription factors.
This result has significant practical consequences for understanding
development, evolution, the Cambrian Explosion, as well as multi-cellular
diseases such as cancer. If the arguments are sound, then genes cannot explain
the development of complex multicellular organisms and genes cannot explain the
evolution of complex multicellular life.

low-Mach-number temperature stratified turbulence (i.e., for turbulent
convection or stably stratified turbulence), and show that turbulent flux of
entropy is given by ${\bf F}_s=\overline{\rho} \, \overline{{\bf u} s}$, where
$\overline{\rho}$ is the mean fluid density, $s$ are fluctuations of entropy
and overbars denote averaging over an ensemble of turbulent velocity field,
${\bf u}$. We demonstrate that the turbulent flux of entropy is different from
the turbulent convective flux, ${\bf F}_c=\overline{T} \, \overline{\rho} \,
\overline{{\bf u} s}$, of the fluid internal energy, where $\overline{T}$ is
the mean fluid temperature. This turbulent convective flux is well-known in the
astrophysical and geophysical literature, and it cannot be used as a turbulent
flux in the equation for the mean entropy. This result is exact for
low-Mach-number temperature stratified turbulence and is independent of the
model used. We also derive equations for the velocity-entropy correlation,
$\overline{{\bf u} s}$, in the limits of small and large Peclet numbers, using
the quasi-linear approach and the spectral tau approximation, respectively.
This study is important in view of different applications to the astrophysical
and geophysical temperature stratified turbulence.

pattern recognition on genome sequences. We apply HMM for identifying genes
encoding the Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) in the genomes of Trypanosoma
brucei (T. brucei) and other African trypanosomes. These are parasitic protozoa
causative agents of sleeping sickness and several diseases in domestic and wild
animals. These parasites have a peculiar strategy to evade the host's immune
system that consists in periodically changing their predominant cellular
surface protein (VSG). The motivation for using patterns recognition methods to
identify these genes, instead of traditional homology based ones, is that the
levels of sequence identity (amino acid and DNA sequence) amongst these genes
is often below of what is considered reliable in these methods. Among pattern
recognition approaches, HMM are particularly suitable to tackle this problem
because they can handle more naturally the determination of gene edges. We
evaluate the performance of the model using different number of states in the
Markov model, as well as several performance metrics. The model is applied
using public genomic data. Our empirical results show that the VSG genes on T.
brucei can be safely identified (high sensitivity and low rate of false
positives) using HMM.

as they play a part in improving productivity and business outcomes. However,
the deployment of these services fluctuates between success and failure. This
paper intends to assess their deployment and how they can contribute to value
creation in different industries. We investigate the relationship between the
services' functionalities and the organizational requirement of these services
represented by the coordination. We also consider the organizational
transformation driven by servitization and emphasize its impact on the act of
coordination. We highlight the tight correlation between the functionalities
and the requirement in organic forms which suggests a successful deployment in
such enterprises. We nonetheless find that, when the servitization is a
strategic intent in organizations with mechanistic characteristics, deploying
social and collaborative services can contribute to achieving this aim.
