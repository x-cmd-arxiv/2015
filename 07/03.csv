computing highly oscillatory integrals having integrable singularities and
stationary points. The first class of the quadrature rules has a polynomial
order of convergence and the second class has an exponential order of
convergence. We first modify the moment-free Filon-type method for the
oscillatory integrals without a singularity or a stationary point to accelerate
their convergence. We then consider the oscillatory integrals without a
singularity or a stationary point and then those with singularities and
stationary points. The composite quadrature rules are developed based on
partitioning the integration domain according to the wave number and the
singularity of the integrand. The integral defined on a subinterval has either
a weak singularity without rapid oscillation or oscillation without a
singularity. The classical quadrature rules for weakly singular integrals using
graded points are employed for the singular integral without rapid oscillation
and the modified moment-free Filon-type method is used for the oscillatory
integrals without a singularity. Unlike the existing methods, the proposed
methods do not have to compute the inverse of the oscillator. Numerical
experiments are presented to demonstrate the approximation accuracy and the
computational efficiency of the proposed methods. Numerical results show that
the proposed methods outperform methods published most recently.

36 % increase in the spin-down rate. Combining the persistent state braking
index measurement and different spin-down states, PSR B0540-69 is more powerful
than intermittent pulsars in constraining pulsar spin-down models. The pulsar
wind model is applied to explain the variable timing behavior of PSR B0540-69.
The persistent state braking index of PSR B0540-69 is the combined effect of
magnetic dipole radiation and particle wind. The particle density reflects the
magnetospheric activity in real-time and may be responsible for the changing
spin-down behavior. Corresponding to the 36 % increase in the spin-down rate of
PSR B0540-69, the relative increase in the particle density is 88 % in the
vacuum gap model. And the model calculated braking index in the new state is
n=1.79. Future braking index observation of PSR B0540-69 in the new spin-down
state will be very powerful in distinguishing between different pulsar

of computational power it is now possible to undertake TDHF calculations
without any symmetry assumptions and incorporate the major strides made by the
nuclear structure community in improving the energy density functionals used in
these calculations. In particular, time-odd and tensor terms in these
functionals are naturally present during the dynamical evolution, while being
absent or minimally important for most static calculations. The parameters of
these terms are determined by the requirement of Galilean invariance or local
gauge invariance but their significance for the reaction dynamics have not been
fully studied. This work addresses this question with emphasis on the tensor
force. Method: The full version of the Skyrme force, including terms arising
only from the Skyrme tensor force, is applied to the study of collisions within
a completely symmetry-unrestricted TDHF implementation. Results: We examine the
effect on fusion thresholds with and without the tensor force terms and find an
effect on the fusion threshold energy of the order several MeV. Details of the
distribution of the energy within terms in the energy density functional is
also discussed. Conclusions: Terms in the energy density functional linked to
the tensor force can play a non-negligible role in dynamic processes in nuclei,
including those in which the terms do not affect ground state properties.

solar active region (AR) 12192 from October 18 to 29. Among them, thirty
(including six X- and twenty-four M-class) flares originated from the AR core
and the other five M-flares appeared at the AR periphery. Four of the X-flares
exhibited similar flaring structures, indicating they were homologous flares
with analogous triggering mechanism. The possible scenario is: photospheric
motions of emerged magnetic fluxes lead to shearing of the associated coronal
magnetic field, which then yields a tether-cutting favorable configuration.
Among the five periphery M-flares, four were associated with jet activities.
The HMI vertical magnetic field data show that the photospheric fluxes of
opposite magnetic polarities emerged, converged and canceled with each other at
the footpoints of the jets before the flares. Only one M-flare from the AR
periphery was followed by a coronal mass ejection (CME). From October 20 to 26,
the mean decay index of the horizontal background field within the height range
of 40-105 Mm is below the typical threshold for torus instability onset. This

In this article, we explore the implications for existing scenarios of
baryogenesis. Many compelling models of baryogenesis rely on electroweak
sphalerons to relax a $(B+L)$ charge asymmetry. Depending on the sign of the
CP-violating parameter, it is shown that the erasure of positive $(B+L)$ will
proceed more or less quickly than the relaxation of negative $(B+L)$. This is a
higher order effect in the kinetic equation for baryon number, which we derive
here through order $n_{B+L}^2$. Its impact on known baryogenesis models
therefore seems minor, since phenomenologically $n_{B+L}$ is much smaller than
the entropy density. However, there remains an intriguing unexplored
possibility that baryogenesis could be achieved with the vacuum angle alone
providing the required CP-violation.

rounding is shown by proving that for any k={2,..., n} and constant
$\varepsilon > 0$, Max-k-Ordering has an LP integrality gap of 2 -
$\varepsilon$ for $n^{\Omega\left(1/\log\log k\right)}$ rounds of the
Sherali-Adams hierarchy.
  A further generalization of Max-k-Ordering is the restricted maximum acyclic
subgraph problem or RMAS, where each vertex v has a finite set of allowable
labels $S_v \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^+$. We prove an LP rounding based
$4\sqrt{2}/(\sqrt{2}+1) \approx 2.344$ approximation for it, improving on the
$2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828$ approximation recently given by Grandoni et al.
(Information Processing Letters, Vol. 115(2), Pages 182-185, 2015). In fact,
our approximation algorithm also works for a general version where the
objective counts the edges which go forward by at least a positive offset
specific to each edge.
  The minimization formulation of digraph ordering is DAG edge deletion or
DED(k), which requires deleting the minimum number of edges from an n-vertex
directed acyclic graph (DAG) to remove all paths of length k. We show that
both, the LP relaxation and a local ratio approach for DED(k) yield
k-approximation for any $k\in [n]$.

pursued both as an empirical study in its own right, as well as providing a
benchmark resource against which the outputs from numerical simulations can be
compared. GAMA has three particularly compelling aspects which set it apart:
completeness, selection, and panchromatic coverage. The very high redshift
completeness ($\sim 98$\%) allows for extremely complete and robust pair and
group catalogues; the simple selection ($r<19.8$mag) minimises the selection
bias and simplifies its management; and the panchromatic coverage, 0.2$\mu$m -

spatial dimension is compactified on the orbifold $S^1/(Z_2 \times Z_2')$,
leading to Pati-Salam gauge symmetry on the boundary where Yukawa interactions
are localised. The gauge symmetry breaking is completed by means of a rather
economic scalar sector, avoiding the doublet-triplet splitting problem. The
matter fields live in the bulk and their massless modes get exponential
profiles, which naturally explain the mass hierarchy of the different fermion
generations. Quarks and leptons properties are naturally reproduced by a
mechanism, first proposed by Kitano and Li, that lifts the SO(10) degeneracy of
bulk masses in terms of a single parameter. The model provides a realistic
pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles for large values of $\tan\beta$. It
favours normally ordered neutrino mass spectrum with the lightest neutrino mass
below 0.01 eV and no preference for leptonic CP violating phases. The right
handed neutrino mass spectrum is very hierarchical and does not allow for
thermal leptogenesis. We analyse several variants of the basic framework and
find that the results concerning the fermion spectrum are remarkably stable.

the distance between two slabs in the condensate and, decays exponentially in
the non-condensed state situated very close to the point of phase transition.
Most importently, this study enabled us to predict the shift of the density of
excited bosons due to mean field potential, and also the dimensional dependence
of the critical exponent. The form of the critical exponent is found to be
$\frac{1}{d-2}$ for the imperfect Bose gas. This leads to a value of critical

understanding how changes in the data affect the output of a view or standing
query. Example applications are explaining query results, propagating updates
through views, and anonymizing datasets. These applications usually rely on
understanding how interventions in a database impact the output of a query. An
important aspect of this analysis is the problem of deleting a minimum number
of tuples from the input tables to make a given Boolean query false. We refer
to this problem as ""the resilience of a query"" and show its connections to the
well-studied problems of deletion propagation and causal responsibility. In
this paper, we study the complexity of resilience for self-join-free
conjunctive queries, and also make several contributions to previous known
results for the problems of deletion propagation with source side-effects and
causal responsibility: (1) We define the notion of resilience and provide a
complete dichotomy for the class of self-join-free conjunctive queries with
arbitrary functional dependencies; this dichotomy also extends and generalizes
previous tractability results on deletion propagation with source side-effects.
(2) We formalize the connection between resilience and causal responsibility,
and show that resilience has a larger class of tractable queries than
responsibility. (3) We identify a mistake in a previous dichotomy for the
problem of causal responsibility and offer a revised characterization based on
new, simpler, and more intuitive notions. (4) Finally, we extend the dichotomy
for causal responsibility in two ways: (a) we treat cases where the input
tables contain functional dependencies, and (b) we compute responsibility for a
set of tuples specified via wildcards.

  We report here the discovery of the largest regular formation in the
observable Universe; a ring with a diameter of 1720 Mpc, displayed by 9 gamma
ray bursts (GRBs), exceeding by a factor of five the transition scale to the
homogeneous and isotropic distribution. The ring has a major diameter of $43^o$
and a minor diameter of $30^o$ at a distance of 2770 Mpc in the 0.78<z<0.86
redshift range, with a probability of $2\times 10^{-6}$ of being the result of
a random fluctuation in the GRB count rate.
  Evidence suggests that this feature is the projection of a shell onto the
plane of the sky. Voids and string-like formations are common outcomes of
large-scale structure. However, these structures have maximum sizes of 150 Mpc,
which are an order of magnitude smaller than the observed GRB ring diameter.
Evidence in support of the shell interpretation requires that temporal

  Stein","Temperatures in transient climates: improved methods for simulations
  with evolving temporal covariances","35 pages, 15 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Future climate change impacts depend on temperatures not only through changes
in their means but also through changes in their variability. General
circulation models (GCMs) predict changes in both means and variability;
however, GCM output should not be used directly as simulations for impacts
assessments because GCMs do not fully reproduce present-day temperature
distributions. This paper addresses an ensuing need for simulations of future
temperatures that combine both the observational record and GCM projections of
changes in means and temporal covariances. Our perspective is that such
simulations should be based on transforming observations to account for GCM
projected changes, in contrast to methods that transform GCM output to account
for discrepancies with observations. Our methodology is designed for simulating
transient (non-stationary) climates, which are evolving in response to changes
in CO$_2$ concentrations (as is the Earth at present). This work builds on
previously described methods for simulating equilibrium (stationary) climates.
Since the proposed simulation relies on GCM projected changes in covariance, we
describe a statistical model for the evolution of temporal covariances in a GCM
under future forcing scenarios, and apply this model to an ensemble of runs
from one GCM, CCSM3. We find that, at least in CCSM3, changes in the local
covariance structure can be explained as a function of the regional mean change
in temperature and the rate of change of warming. This feature means that the
statistical model can be used to emulate the evolving covariance structure of
GCM temperatures under scenarios for which the GCM has not been run. When
combined with an emulator for mean temperature, our methodology can simulate
evolving temperatures under such scenarios, in a way that accounts for
projections of changes while still retaining fidelity with the observational
record.

asymptotically fewer scalar operations than the classical algorithm, have been
considered primarily of theoretical interest. Apart from Strassen's original
algorithm, few fast algorithms have been efficiently implemented or used in
practical applications. However, there exist many practical alternatives to
Strassen's algorithm with varying performance and numerical properties. Fast
algorithms are known to be numerically stable, but because their error bounds
are slightly weaker than the classical algorithm, they are not used even in
cases where they provide a performance benefit.
  We argue in this paper that the numerical sacrifice of fast algorithms,
particularly for the typical use cases of practical algorithms, is not
prohibitive, and we explore ways to improve the accuracy both theoretically and
empirically. The numerical accuracy of fast matrix multiplication depends on
properties of the algorithm and of the input matrices, and we consider both
contributions independently. We generalize and tighten previous error analyses
of fast algorithms and compare their properties. We discuss algorithmic
techniques for improving the error guarantees from two perspectives:
manipulating the algorithms, and reducing input anomalies by various forms of
diagonal scaling. Finally, we benchmark performance and demonstrate our
improved numerical accuracy.

non-full-dimensionality of its corresponding P-face-a face of minimum dimension
that contains P-is the unique source of origin (problem Type I). Otherwise, the
occurrence of multiple WR-projections or, correspondingly, multiple P-faces
becomes the other additional source of origin (problem Type II). To the best of
our knowledge, while problem Type I has been correctly addressed in the
literature, the simultaneous occurrences of problems Types I and II have not
effectively been coped with. Motivated by this, we first show that problem Type
II can be circumvented by using a P-face containing all the P-faces. Based on

Cluster (NSC). Based on the inferred mass in the innermost parsec ($\sim 10^6$
solar masses), over $\sim 10^3$ -- $10^4$ neutron stars should move in the
sphere of gravitational influence of the SMBH. We estimate that a fraction of
them propagate through the denser, ionized medium concentrated mainly along the
three arms of the Minispiral. Based on the properties of the gaseous medium, we
discuss different interaction regimes of magnetised neutron stars passing
through this region. Moreover, we sketch expected observational effects of
these regimes. The simulation results may be applied to other galactic nuclei
hosting NSC, where the expected distribution of the interaction regimes is
different across different galaxy types.

discovered using IRAS data, and past studies have suggested a link between RGs
with overabundant Li and IR excesses, implying the ejection of circumstellar
shells or disks. We revisit the question of IR excesses around RGs using higher
spatial resolution IR data, primarily from WISE. Our goal was to elucidate the
link between three unusual RG properties: fast rotation, enriched Li, and IR
excess. We have 316 targets thought to be K giants, about 40% of which we take
to be Li-rich. In 24 cases with previous detections of IR excess at low spatial
resolution, we believe that source confusion is playing a role, in that either
(a) the source that is bright in the optical is not responsible for the IR
flux, or (b) there is more than one source responsible for the IR flux as
measured in IRAS. We looked for IR excesses in the remaining sources,
identifying 28 that have significant IR excesses by ~20 um (with possible
excesses for 2 additional sources). There appears to be an intriguing
correlation in that the largest IR excesses are all in Li-rich K giants, though
very few Li-rich K giants have IR excesses (large or small). These largest IR
excesses also tend to be found in the fastest rotators. There is no correlation
of IR excess with the carbon isotopic ratio, 12C/13C. IR excesses by 20 um,
though relatively rare, are at least twice as common among our sample of
Li-rich K giants. If dust shell production is a common by-product of Li
enrichment mechanisms, these observations suggest that the IR excess stage is
very short-lived, which is supported by theoretical calculations. Conversely,
the Li-enrichment mechanism may only occasionally produce dust, and an
additional parameter (e.g., rotation) may control whether or not a shell is
ejected.

a realistic assessment of the technique of using constant cumulative number

stellar mass of a population of galaxies selected from the same cumulative
number density bin to within $\sim 0.20$ dex. Over the stellar mass range we
probe ($10^{10.39}\leq M_s/M_\odot \leq 10^{10.75}$ at $z =$ 3 and
$10^{8.48}\leq M_s/M_\odot \leq 10^{9.55}$ at $z =$ 7) one can reduce this bias
by selecting galaxies based on an evolving cumulative number density. We find
the cumulative number density evolution exhibits a trend towards higher values
which can be quantified by simple linear formulations going as $-0.10\Delta z$
for descendants and $0.12\Delta z$ for progenitors. Utilizing such an evolving
cumulative number density increases the accuracy of descendant/progenitor
tracking by a factor of $\sim2$. This result is in excellent agreement, within
$0.10$ dex, with abundance matching results over the same redshift range.
However, we find that our more realistic cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
produce a much larger scatter in descendant/progenitor stellar masses than
previous studies, particularly when tracking progenitors. This large scatter
makes the application of either the constant cumulative number density or
evolving cumulative number density technique limited to average stellar masses
of populations only, as the diverse mass assembly histories caused by
stochastic physical processes such as gas accretion, mergers, and star
formation of individual galaxies will lead to a larger scatter in other

notion known as phase retrieval -- recovering a complex vector from modulus of
inner product with frame vectors. Phase retrieval is widely studied in many
areas of science but still there is a number of problems that remain to be

specify the conditions for the emergence of cooperation. We show that under
pure group scoring, that is, under the complete absence of image-scoring
information, cooperation is unsustainable. Away from this extreme case,

depends on the population size and is generally very small. We thus conclude

fiber with low focal ratio degradation is selected for the fiber-positioner and
fiber-slit components, minimizing the effects of fiber movements and fiber
bending. Fiber positioning will be performed by a positioner consisting of two

public Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy (VIKING)
surveys. These surveys are among the deeper wide-field surveys that can be used
to uncovered large numbers of z~6 quasars. This allows us to probe a more
common population of z~6 quasars that is fainter than the well-studied quasars
from the main Sloan Digital Sky Survey. From this first set of combined survey
catalogues covering ~250 deg^2 we selected point sources down to Z_AB=22 that
had a very red i-Z (i-Z>2.2) colour. After follow-up imaging and spectroscopy,
we discovered four new quasars in the redshift range 5.8<z<6.0. The absolute
magnitudes at a rest-frame wavelength of 1450 A are between -26.6 < M_1450 <
-24.4, confirming that we can find quasars fainter than M^*, which at z=6 has
been estimated to be between M^*=-25.1 and M^*=-27.6. The discovery of 4
quasars in 250 deg^2 of survey data is consistent with predictions based on the
z~6 quasar luminosity function. We discuss various ways to push the candidate
selection to fainter magnitudes and we expect to find about 30 new quasars down
to an absolute magnitude of M_1450=-24. Studying this homogeneously selected
faint quasar population will be important to gain insight into the onset of the
co-evolution of the black holes and their stellar hosts.

overestimate the measured H$\alpha$ escape fractions for all samples. The
interpretation of this result for dust-poor z ~ 0 galaxies is that regions with
ionizing stars have more dust than regions with nonionizing UV-emitting stars.
Dust distributions for these galaxies are nonuniform. The interpretation of the
overestimates for dusty galaxies at both redshifts is less clear. If the
attenuation formula is inapplicable to these galaxies, perhaps the
disagreements are unphysical; perhaps dust distributions in these galaxies are
uniform. If the attenuation formula does apply, then dusty galaxies have
nonuniform dust distributions; the distributions are more uniform than they are

pressurisation better, we investigate the effect of an ambient external
pressure on gas fragmentation and triggering of starburst activity by means of
hydrodynamical simulations. We find that moderate levels of over-pressurisation

important constraints to galaxy formation scenarios. Thanks to the area
covered, depth, excellent spatial resolution and seeing, the ESO Public optical
Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS), carried out with the VLT Survey Telescope (VST),
offers a unique opportunity to conduct a complete census of the most compact
galaxies in the Universe. This paper presents a first census of such systems
from the first 156 square degrees of KiDS. Our analysis relies on g-, r-, and
i-band effective radii ($R_{\rm e}$), derived by fitting galaxy images with
PSF-convolved S\'ersic models, high-quality photometric redshifts, $z_{\rm
phot}$, estimated from machine learning techniques, and stellar masses, $M_{\rm
\star}$, calculated from KiDS aperture photometry. After massiveness ($M_{\rm
\star} > 8 \times 10^{10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$) and compactness ($R_{\rm e} < 1.5
\, \rm kpc$ in g-, r- and i-bands) criteria are applied, a visual inspection of
the candidates plus near-infrared photometry from VIKING-DR1 are used to refine
our sample. The final catalog, to be spectroscopically confirmed, consists of
92 systems in the redshift range $z \sim 0.2-0.7$. This sample, which we expect
to increase by a factor of ten over the total survey area, represents the first
attempt to select massive super-compact ETGs (MSCGs) in KiDS. We investigate
the impact of redshift systematics in the selection, finding that this seems to
be a major source of contamination in our sample. A preliminary analysis shows
that MSCGs exhibit negative internal colour gradients, consistent with a
passive evolution of these systems. We find that the number density of MSCGs is
only mildly consistent with predictions from simulations at $z>0.2$, while no
such system is found at $z < 0.2$.

Galactic latitudes (b < 20 deg) and at low surface brightnesses (fainter than
29 mag arcsec^-2, in the V-band) currently limits our understanding of the
faintest limits of the galaxy luminosity function. This paper is a
proof-of-concept that groups of two or more RR Lyrae stars reveal MW dwarf
galaxies at d > 50 kpc in these unmined regions of parameter space, with only
modest contamination from interloper groups when large halo structures are
excluded. For example, a friends-of-friends (FOF) search with a linking length
of 500 pc could reveal dwarf galaxies more luminous than M_V = -3.2 mag and
with surface brightnesses as faint as 31 mag arcsec^-2 (or even fainter,
depending on RR Lyrae specific frequency). Although existing public RR Lyrae
catalogs are highly incomplete at d > 50 kpc and/or include <1% of the MW
halo's volume, a FOF search reveals two known dwarfs (Bootes I and Sextans) and
two dwarf candidate groups possibly worthy of follow-up. PanSTARRS 1 (PS1) may
catalog RR Lyrae to 100 kpc which would include ~15% of predicted MW dwarf
galaxies. Groups of PS1 RR Lyrae should therefore reveal very low surface
brightness and low Galactic latitude dwarfs within its footprint, if they
exist. With sensitivity to RR Lyrae to d >600 kpc, LSST is the only planned
survey that will be both wide-field and deep enough to use RR Lyrae to
definitively measure the Milky Way's dwarf galaxy census to extremely low
surface brightnesses, and through the Galactic plane.

the results for various subsamples of groups using a halo model framework which
accounts for the mis-centring of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (used as the
tracer of the group centre) with respect to the centre of the group's dark

and vortex artificial spin ice realizations allow creation of doping sites
through double occupation of individual traps. We find that doping square and
kagome ice geometries produces opposite effects. For square ice, doping creates
local excitations in the ground state configuration that produce a local
melting effect as the temperature is raised. In contrast, the kagome ice ground
state can absorb the doping charge without generating non-ground-state

is suppressed near the doping sites. These results indicate that in the square

fractions as high as $Y \approx 0.40$ (e.g., in $\omega$ Centauri). However,
the advanced evolution, chemical yields, and final fates of He-rich stars are
largely unexplored. We investigate the consequences of He-enhancement on the
evolution and nucleosynthesis of intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) models of 3, 4, 5, and 6 M$_\odot$ with a metallicity of $Z = 0.0006$
([Fe/H] $\approx -1.4$). We compare models with He-enhanced compositions
($Y=0.30, 0.35, 0.40$) to those with primordial He ($Y=0.24$). We find that the
minimum initial mass for C burning and super-AGB stars with CO(Ne) or ONe cores
decreases from above our highest mass of 6 M$_\odot$ to $\sim$ 4-5 M$_\odot$
with $Y=0.40$. We also model the production of trans-Fe elements via the slow
neutron-capture process (s-process). He-enhancement substantially reduces the
third dredge-up efficiency and the stellar yields of s-process elements (e.g.,
90% less Ba for 6 M$_\odot$, $Y=0.40$). An exception occurs for 3 M$_\odot$,
where the near-doubling in the number of thermal pulses with $Y=0.40$ leads to
$\sim$ 50% higher yields of Ba-peak elements and Pb if the $^{13}$C neutron
source is included. However, the thinner intershell and increased temperatures
at the base of the convective envelope with $Y=0.40$ probably inhibit the
$^{13}$C neutron source at this mass. Future chemical evolution models with our
yields might explain the evolution of s-process elements among He-rich stars in
$\omega$ Centauri.

  KiDS is an ESO Public Survey and dedicated to serving the astronomical
community with high-quality data products derived from the survey data, as well
as with calibration data. Public data releases will be made on a yearly basis,
the first two of which are presented here. For a total of 148 survey tiles

images have been released, accompanied by weight maps, masks, source lists, and
a multi-band source catalog.
  A dedicated pipeline and data management system based on the Astro-WISE

from a suspension of filamentous $\it{fd}$ viruses, which act as rods with

the constituent virus mixture lacks macroscopic chirality, change from a

  We introduce a new estimator that includes many existing ones as special

  * Diminishing proficiency of Field Technicians in discovering carcasses
  as they age;
  * Possibility that some (but not all) carcasses arriving in earlier search

effective models of somatic evolution where cell fate depends on an effective

of cells with the same receptor responding to specific antigens, or directly on
single cells with no regards for clones. We identify fluctuations in the
fitness acting specifically on clones as the essential ingredient leading to
the observed distributions. Combining our models with experiments we
characterize the scale of fluctuations in antigenic environments and we provide
tools to identify the relevant growth signals in different tissues and

profile differs significantly from the NFW form, leading to a $30\%$ bias in

depends on the specific line profile. We use this result to motivate
approximate analytic expressions to the total radial velocity uncertainty for a
stellar spectrum with a given photon noise, resolution, wavelength, effective
temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, macroturbulence, and stellar
rotation. We use these relations to determine the dominant contributions to the
statistical uncertainties in precision radial velocity measurements as a
function of effective temperature and mass for main-sequence stars. For stars
more than $\sim1.1\,M_\odot$ we find that stellar rotation dominates the
velocity uncertainties for moderate and high resolution spectra
($R\gtrsim30,000$). For less massive stars, a variety of sources contribute
depending on the spectral resolution and wavelength, with photon noise due to
decreasing bolometric luminosity generally becoming increasingly important for
low-mass stars at fixed exposure time and distance. In most cases, resolutions
greater than 60,000 provide little benefit in terms of statistical precision.

out-of-equilibrium processes of fractal pattern formation, important in many
areas of science and technology. Despite their simplicity, foundational models
such as diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) or ballistic aggregation (BA), have
contributed to reveal the most basic mechanisms that give origin to fractal
structures. Hitherto, it has been commonly accepted that, in the absence of
long-range particle-cluster interactions, the trajectories of aggregating
particles, carrying the entropic information of the growing medium, are the
main elements of the aggregation dynamics that determine the fractality and
morphology of the aggregates. However, when interactions are not negligible,
fractality is enhanced or emerges from the screening effects generated by the
aggregated particles, a fact that has led to believe that the main contribution
to fractality and morphology is of an energetic character only, turning the
entropic one of no special significance, to be considered just as an intrinsic
stochastic element. Here we show that, even when long-range attractive
interactions are considered, not only screening effects but also, in a very
significant manner, particle trajectories themselves are the two fundamental
ingredients that give rise to the fractality in aggregates. We found that,
while the local morphology of the aggregates is determined by the interactions,
their global aspect will exclusively depend on the particle trajectories. Thus,
by considering an effective aggregation range, we obtain a wide and versatile
generalization of the DLA and BA models. Furthermore, for the first time, we
show how to generate a vast richness of natural-looking branching clusters with
any prescribed fractal dimension, very precisely controlled.

simple straight crack is unstable. For velocities below the instability,
classic modeling using linear elasticity is valid. However, showing the
existence of the instability and calculating the dynamics post-instability
within the linear elastic framework is difficult and controversial. The
experimental results give several indications that the microbranching
phenomenon is basically a three-dimensional phenomenon. Nevertheless, the
theoretical effort has been focused mostly in two-dimensional modeling. In this
work we study the microbranching instability using three-dimensional atomistic
simulations, exploring the difference between the 2D and 3D models. We find
that the basic 3D fracture pattern shares similar behavior with the 2D case.
Nevertheless, we exhibit a clear 3D-2D transition as the crack velocity
increases, while as long as the microbranches are sufficiently small, the
behavior is pure 3D-behavior, while at large driving, as the size of the
microbranches increases, more 2D-like behavior is exhibited. In addition, in 3D
simulations, the quantitative features of the microbranches, separating the
regimes of steady-state cracks (mirror) and post-instability (mist-hackle) are
reproduced clearly, consistent with the experimental findings.

the quantum quench dynamics of the DW system subjected to a sudden change of
the Peierls phase. It is shown that strong pair tunneling evidently influences
the energy spectrum structure of the stationary states. For relatively weak
repulsive interatomic interactions, the dynamics of the DW system with a
maximal initial population difference evolves from Josephson oscillations to
quantum self-trapping as one increases the pair tunneling strength, while for
large repulsion the strong pair tunneling inhibits the quantum self-trapping.
In the case of attractive interatomic interactions, strong pair tunneling tends
to destroy the Josephson oscillations and quantum self-trapping, and the system
eventually enters a symmetric regime of zero population difference. Finally,
the effect of the Peierls phase on the quantum quench dynamics of the system is
analyzed and discussed. These new features are remarkably different from the
usual dynamical behaviors of a BEC in a DW potential.

system where uplink training is required and an active eavesdropper can attack
the training phase to cause pilot contamination at the transmitter. This forces
the precoder used in the subsequent downlink transmission phase to implicitly
beamform towards the eavesdropper, thus increasing its received signal power.
Assuming matched filter precoding and artificial noise (AN) generation at the
transmitter, we derive an asymptotic achievable secrecy rate when the number of
transmit antennas approaches infinity. For the case of a single-antenna active
eavesdropper, we obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal power
allocation policy for the transmit signal and the AN, and find the minimum
transmit power required to ensure reliable secure communication. Furthermore,
we show that the transmit antenna correlation diversity of the intended users
and the eavesdropper can be exploited in order to improve the secrecy rate. In
fact, under certain orthogonality conditions of the channel covariance
matrices, the secrecy rate loss introduced by the eavesdropper can be
completely mitigated.

representability theorem for maps to a topological champ (a.k.a. stack) and
whence an extremely convenient global atlas, i.e. the path space, which permits
an immediate importation of the familiar definitions of homotopy groups and
covering spaces as encountered in elementary text books. In the second place,
it provides the adjoint to Giraud's co-homology, i.e. the homotopy 2-group
$\Pi_2$, by way of the 2-Galois theory of covering champs. In the sufficiently
path connected case this is achieved by much the same construction employed in
constructing 1-covers, i.e. quotients of the path space by a groupoid. In the
general case,so inter alia the pro-finite theory appropriate for algebraic
geometry, the development parallels the axiomatic Galois theory of SGA1. The
resulting explicit description of the homotopy 2-type can be applied to prove
theorems in algebraic geometry: optimal generalisations to $\Pi_2$ (by a very
different method, which even gives improvements to the original case) of the
Lefschetz theorems (over a locally Noetherian base) of SGA2, and a
counterexample to the extension from co-homology to homotopy of the smooth base
change theorem. These limited goals are achieved, albeit arguably at the price
of obscuring the higher categorical structure, without leaving the 2-category

determine the frequency of such fields and their structure. We describe a very

Observations with ISIS at the WHT, and the Main Stellar Spectrograph at the
SAO, support the absence of a field at somewhat lower precision. The new method
is very efficient; it is shown that for suitable DA stars the integration time,

randomization strategies for allocating treatment optimally, by minimizing the
mean square error of the estimated average treatment effect. Analytical
decompositions of the mean square error, due both to the model and to the
randomization distribution, provide insights into aspects of the optimal
designs. In particular, the analysis suggests new notions of balance based on
specific network quantities, in addition to classical covariate balance. The
resulting balanced, optimal restricted randomization strategies are still
design unbiased, in situations where the model used to derive them does not

allocations that ignore the network structure, with extensive simulations.

interband SO coupling is comparable to that of the cubic Dresselhaus term as a
mechanism of the PSL decay. Near anticrossings, the interband-induced spin
mixing leads to unusual spin textures along the energy contours beyond those of

with simple epsilon-greedy methods. In this paper, we consider the challenging
Atari games domain, which requires processing raw pixel inputs and delayed

a neural network, we are able to develop a scalable and efficient approach to
exploration bonuses that can be applied to tasks with complex, high-dimensional
state spaces. In the Atari domain, our method provides the most consistent
improvement across a range of games that pose a major challenge for prior

interest to users. In many cases, users are interested in package
recommendations as collections of items. For example, a dietitian may wish to
derive a dietary plan as a collection of recipes that is nutritionally
balanced, and a travel agent may want to produce a vacation package as a
coordinated collection of travel and hotel reservations. Recent work has
explored extending recommendation systems to support packages of items. These
systems need to solve complex combinatorial problems, enforcing various
properties and constraints defined on sets of items. Introducing constraints on
packages makes recommendation queries harder to evaluate, but also harder to
express: Queries that are under-specified produce too many answers, whereas
queries that are over-specified frequently miss interesting solutions.
  In this paper, we study query relaxation techniques that target package
recommendation systems. Our work offers three key insights: First, even when
the original query result is not empty, relaxing constraints can produce
preferable solutions. Second, a solution due to relaxation can only be
preferred if it improves some property specified by the query. Third,
relaxation should not treat all constraints as equals: some constraints are
more important to the users than others. Our contributions are threefold: (a)
we define the problem of deriving package recommendations through query
relaxation, (b) we design and experimentally evaluate heuristics that relax
query constraints to derive interesting packages, and (c) we present a crowd
study that evaluates the sensitivity of real users to different kinds of
constraints and demonstrates that query relaxation is a powerful tool in
diversifying package recommendations.

four and five operators that mediate dangerously prompt DM decay into SM

effectively stable DM often carries baryon or lepton number, asymmetry sharing

baryon and lepton number violation with a spurion that parameterizes hard

spurions, a residual symmetry persists, maintaining the cosmological stability
of certain DM representations. Finally, we survey the phenomenology of
effectively stable DM as manifested in probes of direct detection, indirect

the evolution of massive stars. Their spectra show strong emission lines of
helium-burning products, in particular highly ionized carbon and oxygen. The
properties of WO stars can be used to provide unique constraints on the
(post-)helium burning evolution of massive stars, as well as their remaining
lifetime and the expected properties of their supernovae. Aims. We aim to
homogeneously analyse the currently known presumed-single WO stars to obtain
the key stellar and outflow properties and to constrain their evolutionary
state. Methods. We use the line-blanketed non-local thermal equilibrium
atmosphere code cmfgen to model the X-Shooter spectra of the WO stars and
deduce the atmospheric parameters. We calculate dedicated evolutionary models
to determine the evolutionary state of the stars. Results. The WO stars have
extremely high temperatures that range from 150 kK to 210 kK, and very low
surface helium mass fractions that range from 44% down to 14%. Their properties
can be reproduced by evolutionary models with helium zero-age main sequence
masses of $M_{\mathrm{He, ini}} = 15-25 M_{\odot}$ that exhibit a fairly strong
(on the order of a few times $10^{-5} M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), homogeneous

evolutionary stage of stars with estimated initial masses of $M_{\mathrm{ini}}
= 40-60 M_{\odot}$. They are post core-helium burning and predicted to explode
as type Ic supernovae within a few thousand years.

non-compact, generally leading to infinite integrals) with integration on
ellipsoids. Under certain conditions regarding the time orientations of the

Busemann-Hausdorff-type volume form can be constructed even if the metric
tensor is not defined or is degenerate along some directions - which is the

LSI+61303 during its outbursts by employing the available set of secondary
focus receivers of the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. Methods: The clear
periodicity of the system LSI+61303 allowed observations to be scheduled
covering the large radio outburst in March-April 2012. We observed LSI+61303 on
14 consecutive days at 2.6, 4.85, 8.35, 10.45, 14.3, 23, and 32 GHz with a
cadence of about 12 hours followed by two additional observations several days
later. Based on these observations we obtained a total of 24 quasi-simultaneous
broad-band radio spectra. Results: During onset, the main flare shows an almost
flat broad-band spectrum, most prominently seen on March 27, 2012, where - for
the first time - a flat spectrum (alpha=0.00+/-0.07, S nu^alpha) is observed up
to 32 GHz (9 mm wavelength). The flare decay phase shows superimposed
'sub-flares' with the spectral index oscillating between -0.4 and -0.1 in a
quasi-regular fashion. Finally, the spectral index steepens during the decay
phase, showing optically thin emission with values alpha $\sim$ -0.5 to -0.7.
Conclusions: The radio characteristics of LSI+61303 compare well with those of
the microquasars XTE J1752-223 and Cygnus X-3. In these systems the flaring
phase is actually also composed of a sequence of outbursts with clearly
different spectral characteristics: a first outburst with a flat/inverted

(GCs). We investigate how different star formation histories (SFHs) shape the
final mass distribution of star clusters. We assume that every star cluster
population forms during a formation epoch of length dt at a constant
star-formation rate (SFR). The mass distribution of such a population is
described by the embedded cluster mass function (ECMF), which is a pure power
law extending to an upper limit M_max. Since the SFR determines M_max, the ECMF
implicitly depends on the SFR. Starting with different SFHs, each SFH is
divided into formation epochs of length dt at different SFRs. The requested
mass function arises from the superposition of the star clusters of all
formation epochs. An improved optimal sampling technique is introduced that
allows generating number and mass distributions, both of which accurately agree
with the ECMF. Moreover, for each SFH the distribution function of all involved
SFRs, F(SFR), is computed. For monotonically decreasing SFHs, F(SFR) always
follows a power law. With F(SFR), we develope the theory of the integrated
galactic embedded cluster mass function (IGECMF). It describes the distribution
function of birth stellar masses of star clusters that accumulated over a
formation episode much longer than dt. The IGECMF indeed reproduces the mass
distribution of star clusters created according to the superposition principle.
Interestingly, all considered SFHs lead to a turn-down with increasing star
cluster mass in their respective IGECMFs. In the past, a turn-down at the
high-mass end has been observed for GC systems in different galaxy clusters and
in the cluster initial mass function. This behavior can be explained naturally
if the observed star cluster ensembles are superpositions of several individual
star cluster populations that formed at different times at different SFRs.

for estimating time of processing of an arbitrary partitioning. With each
partitioning we associate a point in the special finite search space. The
estimation of effectiveness of the particular partitioning is the value of
predictive function in the corresponding point of this space. The problem of
search for an effective partitioning can be formulated as a problem of
optimization of the predictive function. We use metaheuristic algorithms
(simulated annealing and tabu search) to move from point to point in the search
space. In our computational experiments we found partitionings for SAT
instances encoding problems of inversion of some cryptographic functions.
Several of these SAT instances with realistic predicted solving time were
successfully solved on a computing cluster and in the volunteer computing

measurements, using a variety of SiPMs, show an excess in signal far beyond the
physical limit of the number of SiPM microcells without indication of an
ultimate saturation. In this work I propose a solution to this problem.
Different measurements and theoretical models of avalanche propagation indicate
that multiple simultaneous primary avalanches produce an ever narrower and
faster signal. This is because of a speed-up of effective avalanche propagation
processes. It means that SiPMs, operated at their saturation regime, should
become faster the more light they detect. Therefore, signal extraction methods
that use the amplitude of the signal should see an over saturation effect.
Measurements with a commercial SiPM illuminated with bright picosecond pulses
in the saturation regime demonstrate that indeed the rising edge of the SiPM
signal gets faster as the light pulses get brighter. A signal extractor based
on the amplitude shows a nonlinear behavior in comparison to an integrating
charge extractor. This supports the proposed solution for the over saturation
effect. Furthermore I show that this effect can already be seen with a
bandwidth of 300MHz, which means that it should be taken into account for fast
sampling experiments.

also given, and the goal is to find a minimum weight set of arcs the removal of
which destroys every minimum $c$-cost $k$-union-arborescence. An equivalent
version of this problem is where the roots of the arborescences are fixed in
advance. In an earlier paper [A. Bern\'ath and Gy. Pap, \emph{Blocking optimal
arborescences}, Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization, Springer,
2013] we solved this problem for $k=1$. This work reports on other partial
results on the problem. We solve the case when both $c$ and $w$ are uniform --
that is, find a minimum size set of arcs that covers all
$k$-union-arbosercences. Our algorithm runs in polynomial time for this
problem. The solution uses a result of [M. B\'ar\'asz, J. Becker, and A. Frank,
\emph{An algorithm for source location in directed graphs}, Oper. Res. Lett.
\textbf{33} (2005)] saying that the family of so-called insolid sets (sets with
the property that every proper subset has a larger in-degree) satisfies the
Helly-property, and thus can be (efficiently) represented as a subtree
hypergraph. We also give an algorithm for the case when only $c$ is uniform but
$w$ is not. This algorithm is only polynomial if $k$ is not part of the input.

of single- and few-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) in the spectral range from
1.24 eV to 3.22 eV (385 nm to 1000 nm) by developing a hyperspectral imaging
technique that allows one to probe the optical properties with diffraction
limited spatial resolution. We find hyperspectral imaging very suited to study

high luminescence yield for direct gap semiconductors. Moreover, this work
opens the door to study the spatial variation of the optical properties of
other two-dimensional systems, including non-semiconducting materials where

hard X-ray detectors and to enable observing darker sources with high

detectors made of scintillator crystals such as BGO (Bi$_4$Ge$_3$O$_{12}$), and
the background signals are filtered out using anti-coincidence among them.
Japanese X-ray observing satellites ""Suzaku"" and ""ASTRO-H"" employed this
technique in their hard X-ray instruments observing at > 10 keV.
  In the next generation X-ray satellites, such as the NGHXT proposal, a single

X-rays for effectiveness. However, present active shielding is not optimized
for the soft X-ray band, 1-10 keV. For example, Bi and Ge, which are contained
in BGO, have their fluorescence emission lines around 10 keV. These lines
appear in the background spectra obtained by ASTRO-H Hard X-ray Imager, which

accelerators to compute interactions offloaded from the CPU. Here we evaluate
which hardware produces trajectories with GROMACS 4.6 or 5.0 in the most
economical way. We have assembled and benchmarked compute nodes with various
CPU/GPU combinations to identify optimal compositions in terms of raw
trajectory production rate, performance-to-price ratio, energy efficiency, and
several other criteria. Though hardware prices are naturally subject to trends
and fluctuations, general tendencies are clearly visible. Adding any type of
GPU significantly boosts a node's simulation performance. For inexpensive
consumer-class GPUs this improvement equally reflects in the
performance-to-price ratio. Although memory issues in consumer-class GPUs could
pass unnoticed since these cards do not support ECC memory, unreliable GPUs can
be sorted out with memory checking tools. Apart from the obvious determinants
for cost-efficiency like hardware expenses and raw performance, the energy
consumption of a node is a major cost factor. Over the typical hardware
lifetime until replacement of a few years, the costs for electrical power and
cooling can become larger than the costs of the hardware itself. Taking that
into account, nodes with a well-balanced ratio of CPU and consumer-class GPU

  In this work we give study what is the minimal amount of information that we

Standard Model (SM) fermions and all possible light beyond-the-standard-model

introduce a new symmetry, $U(1)_{\nu}$, for all new light fermionic states.
Anomaly cancellations mandate the existence of several new fermion fields with
nontrivial $U(1)_{\nu}$ charges. We develop a concrete model of this type, for
which we show that (i) some fermions remain massless after $U(1)_{\nu}$
breaking -- similar to SM neutrinos -- and (ii) accidental global symmetries
translate into stable massive particles -- similar to SM protons. These
ingredients provide a solution to the dark matter and neutrino mass puzzles
assuming one also postulates the existence of heavy degrees of freedom that act
as ""mediators"" between the two sectors. The neutrino mass mechanism described
here leads to parametrically small Dirac neutrino masses, and the model also
requires the existence of at least four Dirac sterile neutrinos. Finally, we
describe a general technique to write down chiral-fermions-only models that are
at least anomaly-free under a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry.

results of Mueller and Tribe [38], is to show that when space and time are
rescaled correctly, our biased voter model converges to a Wright-Fisher SPDE. A
simple extension of a result of Durrett and Restrepo [18] then shows that the
dual branching coalescing random walk converges to a branching Brownian motion
in which particles coalesce after an exponentially distributed amount of
intersection local time. Brunet et al. [8] have conjectured that genealogies in
models of this type are described by the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent, see
[39]. However, in the model we study there are no simultaneous coalescences.
Our third and most significant result concerns ""tracer dynamics"" in which some
of the initial particles in the biased voter model are labeled. We show that
the joint distribution of the labeled and unlabeled particles converges to the
solution of a system of stochastic partial differential equations. A new
duality equation that generalizes the one Shiga [44] developed for the
Wright-Fisher SPDE is the key to the proof of that result.

These estimators do not require to know in advance if $X$ is actually

\varepsilon}$ acting on smooth functions defined on $\mathbb R.$ Here $A$ is a
Strum-Liouville function with additional hypotheses and $\varepsilon\in \mathbb
R.$ For special pairs $(A,\varepsilon),$ we recover Dunkl's, Heckman's and
Cherednik's operators (in one dimension). The spectral problem for the
operators $\Lambda_{A, \varepsilon}$ is studied. In particular, we obtain
suitable growth estimates for the eigenfunctions of $\Lambda_{A, \varepsilon}$.
  As the operators $\Lambda_{A, \varepsilon}$ are mixture of $d/dx$ and
reflection operators, we prove the existence of an intertwining operator
$V_{A,\varepsilon}$ between $\Lambda_{A, \varepsilon}$ and the usual
derivative. The positivity of $V_{A,\varepsilon}$ is also established.
  Via the eigenfunctions of $\Lambda_{A,\varepsilon},$ we introduce a
generalized Fourier transform $\mathcal F_{A,\varepsilon}.$ An $L^p$-harmonic
analysis for $\mathcal F_{A,\varepsilon}$ is developed when $0<p\leq
{2\over{1+\sqrt{1-\varepsilon^2}}}$ and $-1\leq \varepsilon\leq 1.$ In
particular, an $L^p$-Schwartz space isomorphism theorem for $\mathcal
F_{A,\varepsilon}$ is proved.

lying in a set with commuting actions of the two gauge-groups. We determine the

basic invariant subspaces including unobservable, conditioned invariant and
unobservability subspaces of 1D systems to 2D models. These extensions have
been achieved and facilitated by representing a 2D model as an infinite

constructing algorithms that compute these subspaces in a \emph{finite and
known} number of steps. By utilizing the introduced subspaces the FDI problem
is formulated and necessary and sufficient conditions for its solvability are
provided. Sufficient conditions for solvability of the FDI problem for 2D
systems using both deadbeat and LMI filters are also developed. Moreover, the
capabilities and advantages of our proposed approach are demonstrated by
performing an analytical comparison with the currently available 2D geometric

orientational order patterns -- contrary to what has been suggested -- vanish
in this limit. In the found novel state, the SPR self-organize into a highly
dynamical, high-density, compact region - which we call aggregate - which is
surrounded by a disordered gas. Active stresses build inside aggregates as
result of the combined effect of local orientational order and active forces.
This leads to the most distinctive feature of these aggregates: constant
ejection of polar clusters of SPR. This novel phase-separated state represents
a novel state of matter characterized by large fluctuations in volume and
shape, related to mass ejection, and exhibits positional as well as
orientational local order. SPR systems display new physics unseen in other
active matter systems due to the coupling between density, active stresses, and
orientational order (such coupling cannot be reduced simply to a coupling

the immune system of a fetus is capable learning the limited set of self
antigens but unable to prepare itself for the unlimited variety of nonself
antigens. We have built a computational model that simulates the development of
the adaptive immune system. For simplicity, we concentrated on humoral immunity
and its major components: T cells, B cells, antibodies, interleukins,
non-immune self cells, and foreign antigens. Our model is a microscopic one,
similar to the interacting particle models of statistical physics and
agent-based models in immunology. Furthermore, our model is stochastic: events
are considered random and modeled by a continuous time, finite state Markov
process, that is, they are controlled by finitely many independent exponential
clocks.
  We investigate under what conditions can an immune memory be created that
results in a more effective immune response to a repeated infection. The
simulations show that our self-centered model is realistic. Moreover, in case
of a primary adaptive immune reaction, it can destroy infections more
efficiently than a classical nonself-centered model.
  Predictions of our theoretical model were clinically supported by
autoimmune-related adverse events in high-dose immune checkpoint inhibitor
immunotherapy trials and also by safe and successful low-dose immune checkpoint
inhibitor combination treatment of heavily pretreated stage IV cancer patients
who had exhausted all conventional treatments.

possibly in only one of the subjects covered, and therefore little background
knowledge is assumed. The first part is an introduction to classical and
quantum information theory (CIT, QIT): basic definitions and tools of CIT are
introduced, such as the information content of a random variable, the typical
set, and some principles of data compression. Some concepts and results of QIT
are then introduced, such as the qubit, the pure and mixed states, the Holevo
theorem, the no-cloning theorem, and the quantum complementarity. In the second
part, two applications of QIT to open problems in theoretical physics are
discussed. The black hole (BH) information paradox is related to the phenomenon
of the Hawking radiation (HR). Consid- ering a BH starting in a pure state,
after its complete evaporation only the Hawking radiation will remain, which is
shown to be in a mixed state. This either describes a non-unitary evolution of
an isolated system, contradicting the evolution postulate of quantum mechanics
and violating the no-cloning theorem, or it implies that the initial
information content can escape the BH, therefore contradicting general
relativity. The progress toward the solution of the paradox is discussed. The
renormalization group (RG) aims at the extraction of the macroscopic
description of a physical system from its microscopic description. This passage
from microscopic to macroscopic can be described in terms of several steps from
one scale to another, and is therefore formalized as the action of a group. The
c-theorem proves the existence, under certain conditions, of a function which
is monotonically decreasing along the group transformations. This result
suggests an interpretation of this function as entropy, and its use to study
the information flow along the RG transformations.

quasars using both the VLBA and EVN at 5 GHz. All the selected sources have
balnicity indices (BI) more than 0 and radio flux densities less than 80 mJy at
1.4 GHz. They are very compact with linear sizes of the order of a few tens of
parsecs and radio luminosities at 1.4 GHz above the FRI-FRII luminosity
threshold. Most of the observed objects have been resolved at 5 GHz showing
one-sided, probably core-jet structures, typical for quasars. We discuss in
detail their age and orientation based on the radio observations. We then used
the largest available sample of BAL quasars to study the relationships between
the radio and optical properties in these objects. We found that (1) the
strongest absorption (high values of the balnicity index BI) is connected with
the lower values of the radio-loudness parameter, logR_I<1.5, and thus probably
with large viewing angles; (2) the large span of the BI values in each bin of
the radio-loudness parameter indicates that the orientation is only one of the
factors influencing the measured absorption; (3) most of the radio-loud BAL
quasars are compact, low luminosity objects with a wide range of jet power
(although the highest values of BI seem to be associated with the lower values
of jet power). In addition, we suggest that the short lifetime postulated for
some compact AGNs could also explain the scarcity of the large-scale radio
sources among BAL quasars.

Xe 3d$_{5/2}$, Xe 3d$_{3/2}$, and F 1s subshells in the 660--740 eV range are
compared to explore effects of the F ligands. The Xe 3d - $\epsilon$f continuum
shape resonances dominate the photoionization cross sections of both the atom
and molecule, but prominent resonances appear in the XeF$_2$ cross section due
to nominal excitation of Xe 3d and F 1s electrons to the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO), a delocalized anti-bonding MO. The subshell
ionization thresholds, the LUMO resonance energies and their oscillator
strengths are calculated by relativistic coupled-cluster methods. Several
charge states and fragment ions are produced from the atom and molecule due to
alternative decay pathways from the inner-shell holes. Total and partial ion
yields vary in response to the shape resonances and LUMO resonances. Previous
calculations and measurements of atomic Xe 3d core-hole decay channels and our
calculated results for XeF$_2$ guide interpretations of the molecular ion
products. The partial ion yields of XeF$_2$ are dominated by Xe 3d core-hole
decays, but distinct ion products are measured at the F 1s - LUMO resonance. Xe
3d core-hole decays from XeF$_2$ produce lower charge states in comparison with
atomic Xe, and energetic F ions are produced by Coulomb explosions of the
molecular ions. The measurements support a model of molecular core-hole decay
that begins with a localized hole, stepwise Auger electron emission spreads
charge across neighboring atoms, and the system fragments energetically.

could be confirmed, e.g. the largest probability of margination of white blood
cells at an intermediate range of hematocrit values and a decreasing tendency
with increasing deformability. The consideration of inertia effects, which
become of relevance in small vessels, also shows a dependency and leads to less
pronounced margination of white blood cells with increasing Reynolds number.
