plasmas embedded in a magnetic field. For periodic systems with one degree of
freedom the Poincar\'e map provides a splitting of the phase space into regions
where particles have different kinds of motion: periodic, quasi-periodic or
chaotic. The boundaries of these regions are transport barriers; i.e., a
trajectory cannot cross such boundaries during the whole evolution of the
system. Lagrangian Coherent Structure (LCS) generalize this method to systems
with the most general time dependence, splitting the phase space into regions
with different qualitative behaviours. This leads to the definition of
finite-time transport barriers, i.e. trajectories cannot cross the barrier for
a finite amount of time. This methodology can be used to identify fast
recirculating regions in the dynamical system and to characterize the transport
between them.

need NLTE corrections even at the highest metallicities tested here. The 4554 A

spectrum of the optical flare light curves is dominated by a red-noise
component, typical of aperiodic activity in X-ray binaries. Simultaneous X-ray
and UV observations by the Swift satellite reveal strong correlations that are
consistent with X-ray reprocessing of the UV light, most likely in the outer
regions of the accretion disc. On some nights we also observe sharp-edged,
rectangular, flat-bottomed dips randomly distributed in orbital phase, with a
median duration of ~250 s and a median ingress/egress time of ~20 s. These
rectangular dips are similar to the mode-switching behaviour between disc
`active' and `passive' luminosity states, observed in the X-ray light curves of
other redback millisecond pulsars. This is the first time that the optical
analogue of the X-ray mode-switching has been observed. The properties of the
passive and active state light curves can be explained in terms of clumpy
accretion from a trapped inner accretion disc near the corotation radius,
resulting in rectangular, flat-bottomed optical and X-ray light curves.

detailed studies have yet been performed on the extent of snowlines in an
embedded accreting disk (Stage 0). Quantify the location of gas-phase volatiles
in embedded actively accreting disk system. Two-dimensional physical and
radiative transfer models have been used to calculate the temperature structure
of embedded protostellar systems. Gas and ice abundances of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and
CO are calculated using the density-dependent thermal desorption formulation.
The midplane water snowline increases from 3 to 55 AU for accretion rates
through the disk onto the star between $10^{-9}$-$10^{-4} \ M_{\odot} \ {\rm
yr^{-1}}$. CO$_2$ can remain in the solid phase within the disk for $\dot{M}
\leq 10^{-5} \ M_{\odot} \ {\rm yr^{-1}}$ down to $\sim 20$ AU. Most of the CO
is in the gas phase within an actively accreting disk independent of disk
properties and accretion rate. The predicted optically thin water isotopolog
emission is consistent with the detected H$_2^{18}$O emission toward the Stage
0 embedded young stellar objects, originating from both the disk and the warm
inner envelope (hot core). An accreting embedded disk can only account for
water emission arising from $R < 50$ AU, however, and the extent rapidly
decreases for low accretion rates. Thus, the radial extent of the emission can
be measured with ALMA observations and compared to this limit. Volatiles
sublimate out to 50 AU in young disks and can reset the chemical content
inherited from the envelope in periods of high accretion rates. A hot young
solar nebula out to 30 AU can only have occurred during the deeply embedded
Stage 0, not during the T-Tauri phase of our early solar system.

Cohen-Macaulayness of the algebra of $q,t$-deformed power sums defined by

universality, confirming that universality holds even in the high-frequency

faithfully reproduced from one protein to the next. We also characterize
fluctuations of the spectral density from the average, paving the way to a

the deviations in such ""outlier"" proteins. Since the method used for the
derivation of the vibrational modes (potential energy formulation, set of

orthonormal wavelet filter, we show that a quincunx tight framelet filter bank
$\{a;b_1,\ldots,b_L\}$ with $b_1$ taking the above canonical form must have
$L\ge 3$ high-pass filters. Thus, our family of symmetric double canonical
quincunx tight framelets has the minimum number of generators. Numerical
calculation indicates that this family of symmetric double canonical quincunx
tight framelets can be arbitrarily smooth. Using one-dimensional filters having
linear-phase moments, in this paper we also provide a second approach to
construct multiple canonical quincunx tight framelets with symmetry. In
particular, the second approach yields a family of $6$-multiple canonical
real-valued quincunx tight framelets in $L_2(R^2)$ and a family of double

energy driving the observed acceleration of the Universe on giga-parsec scales

experiments. To do that, we first introduce the idea that scalar fields could
be responsible for dark energy and show that in order to be compatible with
fifth force constraints these fields must have a screening mechanism which
hides their effects from us within the solar system. Particular emphasis is
placed on one such screening mechanism known as the chameleon effect where the
field's mass becomes dependent on the environment. The way the field behaves in
the presence of a spherical source is determined and we then go on to show how
in the presence of the kind of high vacuum associated with atom interferometry
experiments, and when the test particle is an atom, it is possible to use the
associated interference pattern to place constraints on the acceleration due to
the fifth force of the chameleon field - this has already been used to rule out
large regions of the chameleon parameter space and maybe one day will be able
to detect the force due to the dark energy field in the laboratory.

The Sun is an active source of radio emission that is often
associated with energetic phenomena ranging from nanoflares to coronal mass
ejections (CMEs). At low radio frequencies (<100 MHz), numerous millisecond
duration radio bursts have been reported, such as radio spikes or solar S
bursts (where S stands for short). To date, these have neither been studied
extensively nor imaged because of the instrumental limitations of previous
radio telescopes. Aims. Here, Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations were
used to study the spectral and spatial characteristics of a multitude of S
bursts, as well as their origin and possible emission mechanisms. Methods. We
used 170 simultaneous tied-array beams for spectroscopy and imaging of S
bursts. Since S bursts have short timescales and fine frequency structures,
high cadence (~50 ms) tied-array images were used instead of standard
interferometric imaging, that is currently limited to one image per second.
Results. On 9 July 2013, over 3000 S bursts were observed over a time period of
~8 hours. S bursts were found to appear as groups of short-lived (<1 s) and
narrow-bandwidth (~2.5 MHz) features, the majority drifting at ~3.5 MHz/s and a
wide range of circular polarisation degrees (2-8 times more polarised than the
accompanying Type III bursts). Extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic field
using the potential field source surface (PFSS) model suggests that S bursts
are associated with a trans-equatorial loop system that connects an active
region in the southern hemisphere to a bipolar region of plage in the northern
hemisphere. Conclusions. We have identified polarised, short-lived solar radio
bursts that have never been imaged before. They are observed at a height and
frequency range where plasma emission is the dominant emission mechanism,
however they possess some of the characteristics of electron-cyclotron maser
emission.

measurable levels. Typically, amplification mechanisms are considered at the
microscopic scales of individual molecules and their aggregates. Here we
demonstrate chirality amplification and visualization of structural handedness
in water solutions of organic molecules that extends over the scale of many
micrometers. The mechanism is rooted in the long-range elastic nature of
orientational order in lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) formed in
water solutions of achiral disc-like molecules. The nematic LCLC coexists with
its isotropic counterpart, forming elongated tactoids; spatial confinement
causes structural twist even when the material is nonchiral. Minute quantities
of chiral molecules such as amino acid L-alanine and limonene transform the
racemic array of left- and right-twisted tactoids into a homochiral set. The
left and right chiral enantiomers are readily distinguished from each other as
the induced structural handedness is visualized through a simple polarizing
microscope observation. The effect is important for developing our
understanding of chirality amplification mechanisms; it also might open new
possibilities in biosensing.

as well as a second, damped mode of this type between the two gap energies.
Both modes soften as the s + id phase is approached, and only a single
""mixed-symmetry Bardasis-Schrieffer mode"" below the pairbreaking continuum
propagates in the s + id phase itself. These modes coexist with a damped
Leggett mode with collective frequency between the two gap scales. In the pure

briefly discuss Raman scattering experiments and how they can be used to
identify an s + id state, and to track the evolution of competing s- and d-

symmetry except $\mathrm{C_{3i}}$. They have two classes of reflection
symmetry, with the mirror plane parallel to rotation axis and the mirror plane
perpendicular to rotation axis. In both cases two types of Dirac semimetals are
determined by four different reflection symmetries. The first type of Dirac
semimetals will appear through accidental band crossing (ABC). The second type
of Dirac semimetals have a Dirac point at a time reversal invariant momentum

can have stable Dirac points as ABC or TBC. We further discuss that Weyl line

observed -- the X-ray fluxes are found to vary in a stochastic or
quasi-periodic manner on roughly hour-long times-scales, and simultaneous UV
observations using the Optical Monitor on XMM for these sources show similar
variations in the UV flux. These data, together with previous studies, show
that X-ray emission is found only in fuvAGB stars. From modeling the spectra,
we find that the observed X-ray luminosities are ~(0.002-0.2 ) Lsun, and the
X-ray emitting plasma temperatures are ~(35-160) x 10^6 K. The high X-ray
temperatures argue against the emission arising in stellar coronae, or directly
in an accretion shock, unless it occurs on a WD companion. However, none of the
detected objects is a known WD-symbiotic star, suggesting that if WD companions
are present, they are relatively cool (<20,000 K). In addition, the high X-ray
luminosities specifically argue against emission originating in the coronae of
main-sequence companions. We discuss several models for the X-ray emission and
its variability and find that the most likely scenario for the origin of the
X-ray (and FUV) emission involves accretion activity around a companion star,
with confinement by strong magnetic fields associated with the companion and/or
an accretion disk around it.

fundamental physics, including the determination of fundamental constants, the
laboratory test for their possible variation, and the search for a possible
electric dipole moment of the electron. Optical clocks based on molecular ions
sensitive to some of these effects are expected to achieve uncertainties
approaching the $10^{-18}$ level. While the complexity of molecular structure
facilitates these applications, the absence of cycling transitions poses a
challenge for direct laser cooling, quantum state control, and detection.
Previously employed state detection techniques based on photo-dissociation or
chemical reactions are destructive and therefore inefficient. Here we
experimentally demonstrate non-destructive state detection of a single trapped
molecular ion through its strong Coulomb coupling to a well-controlled
co-trapped atomic ion. An algorithm based on a state-dependent optical dipole
force(ODF) changes the internal state of the atom conditioned on the internal
state of the molecule. We show that individual states in the molecule can be
distinguished by their coupling strength to the ODF and observe black-body
radiation-induced quantum jumps between rotational states. Using the detuning
dependence of the state detection signal, we implement a variant of quantum
logic spectroscopy and improve upon a previous measurement of the
$\mathrm{X}^1\Sigma^+(J=1)\rightarrow\mathrm{A}^1\Sigma^+(J=0)$ transition in
MgH, finding a frequency of 1067.74752(53)THz. We estimate that non-destructive
state detection with near 100% efficiency could take less than 10 ms. The
technique we demonstrate is applicable to a wide range of molecular ions,
enabling further applications in state-controlled quantum chemistry and
spectroscopic investigations of molecules serving as probes for interstellar

losses into a long-lived, highly-entangled many-body state that we characterize
analytically. In the weak coupling regime for large ensembles, we find
analytically the maximum spin squeezing that can be achieved by optimizing both
the coupling and the atom number. This squeezing is fundamentally limited by
spontaneous emission to a constant value, independent of the atom number.
Harnessing entanglement in many-body systems is of fundamental interest [1] and
is the key requirement for quantum enhanced technologies, in particular quantum
metrology [2]. In this respect, many efforts have been devoted to prepare
entangled states in atomic ensembles because of their high degree of coherence
and their potential for precision measurement. Spin squeezed states as well as
number states have been produced following methods based either on coherent
evolution in the presence of a non-linearity in the atomic field [3--5], or on
quantum non-demolition measurement [6--8]. Among methods of the first kind,
cavity feedback [5, 9] is one of the most promising: it has already allowed for
the creation of highly squeezed states [5] and the effective non-linearity
introduced by the atom-cavity coupling can be easily switched off, making it
very attractive for metrol-ogy applications. In this Letter, we analyze the
entangled states that can be produced by cavity feedback in different coupling
regimes from weak to strong, and derive the ultimate limits of the metrology
gain, extending the optimization of squeezing to unexplored domains of
parameters values. After optimization of both the coupling strength and the
atom number, we find a maximum squeezing limit that depends only on the atomic
structure.

magnetic field B applied parallel to the substrate. In the well-studied low

of B. At higher fields we predict a crossover to \reverse PSB"" in which current
is blockaded in the reverse direction due to the occupation of a spin singlet
as opposed to the traditional triplet blockade that occurs at low fields. The
onset of reverse PSB coincides with the development of a tail like feature in
the measured bias triangles and occurs when the Zeeman energy of the polarized
triplet equals the exchange energy in the (0,2) charge configuration. In Si

strong nonlinearities. In the case of athermal gels (such as collagen-I) the
nonlinearity has long been associated with a crossover from a bending dominated
to a stretching dominated regime of elasticity. The physics of this crossover
is related to the existence of a central-force isostatic point and to the fact
that for most gels the bending modulus is small. This crossover induces scaling
behavior for the elastic moduli. In particular, for linear elasticity such a
scaling law has been demonstrated [Broedersz et al. Nature Physics, 2011 7,
983]. In this work we generalize the scaling to the nonlinear regime with a
two-parameter scaling law involving three critical exponents. We test the
scaling law numerically for two disordered lattice models, and find a good
scaling collapse for the shear modulus in both the linear and nonlinear

discuss the applicability of our results to real systems.

Our outlier treatment has a significant impact on the distance scales to

Electroweak Scale due to finite temperature effects in the early universe. In
particular, there is a scalar with an approximate shift symmetry broken by a
technically natural small coupling to the Higgs, and a temperature dependent
potential. As the temperature of the universe drops, the scalar follows the
minimum of its potential altering the Higgs mass squared parameter. The scalar
also has a periodic potential with amplitude proportional to the Higgs
expectation value, which traps it in a vacuum with a small Electroweak Scale.
The required temperature dependence of the potential can occur through strong
coupling effects in a hidden sector that are suppressed at high temperatures.
Alternatively, it can be generated perturbatively from a one-loop thermal
potential. In both cases, for the scalar to be displaced, a hidden sector must
be reheated to temperatures significantly higher than the visible sector.
However this does not violate observational constraints provided the hidden
sector energy density is transferred to the visible sector without disrupting
big bang nucleosynthesis. We also study how the mechanism can be implemented
when the visible sector is completed to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model at a high scale. Models with a UV cutoff of 10 TeV and no fields taking

ETD areas. In contrast with this pathway the other ones shift the ETDs centers

par with data-intensive applications, the sheer size of linear regression

Fortunately, a significant percentage of the data accrued can be omitted while
maintaining a certain quality of statistical inference with an affordable
computational budget. The present paper introduces means of identifying and
omitting ""less informative"" observations in an online and data-adaptive
fashion, built on principles of stochastic approximation and data censoring.
First- and second-order stochastic approximation maximum likelihood-based
algorithms for censored observations are developed for estimating the
regression coefficients. Online algorithms are also put forth to reduce the
overall complexity by adaptively performing censoring along with estimation.
The novel algorithms entail simple closed-form updates, and have provable
(non)asymptotic convergence guarantees. Furthermore, specific rules are
investigated for tuning to desired censoring patterns and levels of
dimensionality reduction. Simulated tests on real and synthetic datasets
corroborate the efficacy of the proposed data-adaptive methods compared to
data-agnostic random projection-based alternatives.

evolves as alpha = -1.16 - 0.12 z over the redshift range z ~ 4.5 to 7.7, in
excellent agreement with observations from e.g., Hathi et al. (2010). However,
for redshifts z ~ 6 to 10.4, alpha(z) appears to display a shallower evolution,
alpha = -1.79 - 0.03 z. Augmenting the simulations with more detailed physics -
specifically stellar winds and supernovae (SN) - produces similar results. The
model shows an overproduction of galaxies, especially at faint magnitudes,
compared with the observations, although the discrepancy is reduced when dust
extinction is taken into account.

of highly-directive beams using low-profile devices. In this paper we provide a
solution to this problem by means of Huygens' metasurfaces (HMSs), based on the
equivalence principle. This principle states that a given excitation can be
transformed to a desirable aperture field by inducing suitable electric and
magnetic surface currents. Building on this concept, we propose and demonstrate
cavity-excited HMS antennas, where the single-source cavity excitation is
designed to optimize aperture illumination, while the HMS facilitates the
current distribution that ensures phase purity of aperture fields. The HMS
breaks the coupling between the excitation and radiation spectrum typical to
standard partially-reflecting surfaces, allowing tailoring of the aperture
properties to produce a desirable radiation pattern. As shown, a single
semianalytical formalism can be followed to achieve control of a variety of
radiation features, such as the direction of the main beam or the side lobe
level, by proper modification of the HMS and the source position. Relying on a
cavity excitation, this can be achieved without incurring edge-taper losses and
without any degradation of the aperture illumination for arbitrarily-large
apertures. With the recent demonstrations of Huygens' metasurfaces at
microwave, terahertz, and optical frequencies, the proposed low-profile design
may find its use in a myriad of applications across the electromagnetic
spectrum, from highly-directive antennas to highly-efficient quantum-dot
emitters, reaching near-unity aperture efficiencies.

since it exhibits a random porous network at different length-scales (from

inner porosity causes strong internal scattering. The key challenges were,
firstly, to optimize the beam parameters considering the inherent trade-off
between photon energy (penetration depth) and spatial resolution and, secondly,
to develop effective signal filtering algorithms. Despite the limited
signal-to-noise ratio detected, large volumes of PS-W could be reconstructed
with good image quality and micrometric resolution (voxel size = 1.4 {\mu}m).
As an important result, we report excellent image quality and higher
penetration depth by applying the same setup on a ferrous microstructure,
namely a 10%W/Steel MMC used as interlayer between PS-W and a
ferritic/martensitic steel substrate. The paper reports a detailed 3D
morphological analysis of all inclusion types in PS-W and W/Steel, which led to
disclosure of a complex connected porous network in both media. The analysis is
presented in terms of multiphase volume fraction, ratio of percolation and 3D
shape descriptors. 3D percolation patterns are analyzed in detail and
sensitivity towards segmentation threshold for the noise-affected PS-W region
is discussed. Remarkably, percolation of the porous phase was found throughout
the entire coating thickness of PS-W. In W-Steel MMC percolation was found in
the perpendicular plane and interpreted as onset of delamination caused by
thermomechanical stress.

estimate galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), including uncertainties, based
on ultra-violet to far-infrared photometry. We use state-of-the art synthetic
photometry derived by performing three-dimensional dust radiative transfer on
hydrodynamic simulations of isolated disc and merging galaxies to test how well
the modified MAGPHYS is able to recover SFHs under idealised conditions, where
the true SFH is known. We find that while the SFH of the model with the best
fit to the synthetic photometry is a poor representation of the true SFH
(showing large variations with the line-of-sight to the galaxy and spurious
bursts of star formation), median-likelihood SFHs generated by marginalising
over the default MAGPHYS libraries produce robust estimates of the
smoothly-varying isolated disk simulation SFHs. This preference for the
median-likelihood SFH is quantitatively underlined by our estimates of
$\chi^2_{{\rm SFH}}$ (analogous to the $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit estimator) and
$\Delta M/M$ (the integrated absolute mass discrepancy between the model and
true SFH) that strongly prefer the median-likelihood SFHs over those that best
fit the UV-to-far-IR photometry. In contrast, we are unable to derive a good
estimate of the SFH for the merger simulations (either best-fit or
median-likelihood) despite being able to obtain a reasonable fit to the

wide-area/shallow XMM-XXL field to estimate the AGN X-ray luminosity function
in the redshift range z=3-5. The sample consists of nearly 340 sources with
either photometric (212) or spectroscopic (128) redshift in the above range.
The combination of deep and shallow survey fields provides a luminosity
baseline of three orders of magnitude, Lx(2-10keV)~1e43-1e46erg/s at z>3. We
follow a Bayesian approach to determine the binned AGN space density and
explore their evolution in a model-independent way. Our methodology accounts
for Poisson errors in the determination of X-ray fluxes and uncertainties in
photometric redshift estimates. We demonstrate that the latter is essential for
unbiased measurement of space densities. We find that the AGN X-ray luminosity
function evolves strongly between the redshift intervals z=3-4 and z=4-5. There
is also suggestive evidence that the amplitude of this evolution is luminosity
dependent. The space density of AGN with Lx<1e45erg/s drops by a factor of 5
between the redshift intervals above, while the evolution of brighter AGN
appears to be milder. Comparison of our X-ray luminosity function with that of
UV/optical selected QSOs at similar redshifts shows broad agreement at bright
luminosities, Lx>1e45erg/s. The faint-end slope of UV/optical luminosity
functions however, is steeper than for X-ray selected AGN. This implies that
the type-I AGN fraction increases with decreasing luminosity at z>3, opposite
to trends established at lower redshift. We also assess the significance of AGN
in keeping the hydrogen ionised at high redshift. Our X-ray luminosity function
yields ionising photon rate densities that are insufficient to keep the
Universe ionised at redshift z>4. A source of uncertainty in this calculation
is the escape fraction of UV photons for X-ray selected AGN.

significance with which we could reject the null hypothesis that the
magnitude-redshift relation is isotropic based on the properties of the
observed most discrepant directions. We find that, based on pure

anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background, we find that the null hypothesis
should be rejected at the $95-99$ per cent confidence level, slightly depending
on the angular resolution of the study. If this result is not due to a
statistical fluke, it might either indicate that the SN data have not been

that if a distribution of rotation velocities exists within the clusters,
rotating stars will remain on the main sequence (MS) for longer, appearing to
be younger than non-rotating stars within the same cluster. This results in an
extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO) that appears at young ages
($\sim30$~Myr) and lasts beyond 1~Gyr. If this eMSTO is interpreted as an age
spread, the resulting age spread is proportional to the age of the cluster,
i.e. young clusters ($<100$~Myr) appear to have small age spreads (10s of Myr)
whereas older clusters ($\sim1$~Gyr) appear to have much larger spreads, up to
a few hundred Myr. We compare the predicted spreads for a sample of rotation
rates to observations of young and intermediate age clusters, and find a strong
correlation between the measured 'age spread' and the age of the cluster, in
good agreement with models of stellar rotation. This suggests that the 'age

The first satellite, Laevens 3, is located at a heliocentric distance of
d=67+/-3 kpc. With a total magnitude of Mv=-4.4+/-0.3 and a half-light radius
rh=7+/-2 pc, its properties resemble those of outer halo globular clusters. The
second system, Draco II/Laevens 4 (Dra II), is a closer and fainter satellite
(d~20 kpc, Mv =-2.9+/-0.8), whose uncertain size (rh = 19 +8/-6 pc) renders its
classification difficult without kinematic information; it could either be a
faint and extended globular cluster or a faint and compact dwarf galaxy. The
third satellite, Sagittarius II/Laevens 5 (Sgr II), has an ambiguous nature as
it is either the most compact dwarf galaxy or the most extended globular
cluster in its luminosity range (rh = 37 +9/-8 pc and Mv=-5.2+/-0.4). At a
heliocentric distance of 67+/-5 kpc, this satellite lies intriguingly close to
the expected location of the trailing arm of the Sagittarius stellar stream
behind the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph). If confirmed through
spectroscopic follow up, this connection would locate this part of the trailing
arm of the Sagittarius stellar stream that has so far gone undetected. It would
further suggest that Sgr II was brought into the Milky Way halo as a satellite
of the Sgr dSph.

voxel-by-voxel collection of fluorescent light emitted throughout the specimen

detection offers some measure of scattering robustness, the rate at which
dynamic specimens can be imaged is severely limited. Other fluorescent imaging
techniques utilize imaging detection to enhance collection rates. A notable
example is light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, also known as selective-plane
illumination microscopy (SPIM), which illuminates a large region within the
specimen and collects emitted fluorescent light at an angle either
perpendicular or oblique to the illumination light sheet. Unfortunately,
scattering of the emitted fluorescent light can cause blurring of the collected
images in highly turbid biological media. We recently introduced an imaging
technique called coherent holographic image reconstruction by phase transfer
(CHIRPT) that combines light-sheet-like illumination with non-imaging
fluorescent light detection. By combining the speed of light-sheet illumination
with the scattering robustness of non-imaging detection, CHIRPT is poised to
have a dramatic impact on biological imaging, particularly for $\textit{in

does not imply any future dark energy singularity or any abrupt event, though
the fermion has a negative kinetic energy. In fact, the equation of state of
this dark energy model will asymptotically approach the value $w=-1$ from above
without crossing the phantom divide and inducing therefore a de Sitter state.
Consequently, we expect the model to be stable because no real phantom fields
will be created. At late time, the torsion fields will vanish as the
corresponding phantom dark ghost spinors dilute. As would be expected,
intuitively, this result is unaffected by the presence of cold dark matter
although the proof is not as straightforward as in general relativity.

mediators, these limits are much stronger than those coming from traditional
low-energy $\nu$ scattering or $\nu$ oscillation experiments for some flavor
structures. Monojet data alone can be used to infer the mass of the ""missing
particle"" from the shape of the missing energy distribution. In particular, 13
TeV LHC data will have sensitivity to DM masses greater than $\sim$ 1 TeV. In
addition to the monojet channel, NSI can be probed in multi-lepton searches
which we find to yield stronger limits at heavy mediator masses. The
sensitivity offered by these multi-lepton channels provide a method to reject
or confirm the DM hypothesis in missing energy searches.

interactions in the upper atmosphere. In this paper, we present the
multiplicity distribution of these atmospheric muons and its comparison with
Monte Carlo simulations. This analysis exploits the large size and excellent
tracking capability of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber. A special emphasis is
given to the study of high multiplicity events containing more than 100
reconstructed muons and corresponding to a muon areal density $\rho_{\mu} >
5.9~$m$^{-2}$. Similar events have been studied in previous underground
experiments such as ALEPH and DELPHI at LEP. While these experiments were able
to reproduce the measured muon multiplicity distribution with Monte Carlo
simulations at low and intermediate multiplicities, their simulations failed to
describe the frequency of the highest multiplicity events. In this work we show
that the high multiplicity events observed in ALICE stem from primary cosmic
rays with energies above $10^{16}$ eV and that the frequency of these events
can be successfully described by assuming a heavy mass composition of primary
cosmic rays in this energy range. The development of the resulting air showers
was simulated using the latest version of QGSJET to model hadronic
interactions. This observation places significant constraints on alternative,
more exotic, production mechanisms for these events.

explore the relationship between two special forms of these techniques: stacked
DFs (namely Auto-context) and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet). Our
main contribution is to show that Auto-context can be mapped to a deep ConvNet
with novel architecture, and thereby trained end-to-end. This mapping can be
used as an initialization of a deep ConvNet, enabling training even in the face
of very limited amounts of training data. We also demonstrate an approximate
mapping back from the refined ConvNet to a second stacked DF, with improved
performance over the original. We experimentally verify that these mappings
outperform stacked DFs for two different applications in computer vision and

segmentation in microscopy images of developing zebrafish. Finally, we revisit
the core mapping from a Decision Tree (DT) to a NN, and show that it is also
possible to map a fuzzy DT, with sigmoidal split decisions, to a NN. This
addresses multiple limitations of the previous mapping, and yields new insights

effect is therefore expected in the early universe, due to the presence of
relativistic particles at recombination, and in the late universe, when dark

can be parameterized by $A_{e\text{ISW}}$ and $A_{l\text{ISW}}$, which rescale

(taking into account the restrictions placed on the statistical analysis of
such objects) and use these to define a phonetic transformation that models how
an individual speaker would sound in a different language, allowing the
exploration of phonetic differences between languages. Finally, we map back
these transformations to the domain of sound recordings, allowing us to listen

demonstrated using recordings of the words corresponding to the numbers from

Witten's perturbation of the de~Rham complex. Another ingredient is certain
perturbation of the Dunkl harmonic oscillator previously studied by the authors
using classical perturbation theory. Assume that $A$ is a stratified
pseudomanifold, and consider its intersection homology $I^{\bar p}H_*(A)$ with
perversity $\bar p$; in particular, the lower and upper middle perversities are
denoted by $\bar m$ and $\bar n$, respectively. Then, for any perversity $\bar
p\le\bar m$, there is an associated good adapted metric on $M$ satisfying the
Nagase isomorphism $H^r_{\text{\rm max}}(M)\cong I^{\bar p}H_r(A)^*$
($r\in\N$). If $M$ is oriented and $\bar p\ge\bar n$, we also get
$H^r_{\text{\rm min}}(M)\cong I^{\bar p}H_r(A)$. Thus our version of the Morse

asymmetries are possible for the hadrons in the jet. When only one unpolarized
hadron is selected, it exhibits an azimuthal modulation known as Collins
effect. When a pair of oppositely charged hadrons is observed, three
asymmetries can be considered, a di-hadron asymmetry and two single hadron
asymmetries. In lepton deep inelastic scattering on transversely polarized
nucleons all these asymmetries are coupled with the transversity distribution.
From the high statistics COMPASS data on oppositely charged hadron-pair
production we have investigated for the first time the dependence of these
three asymmetries on the difference of the azimuthal angles of the two hadrons.
The similarity of transversity induced single and di-hadron asymmetries is
discussed. A new analysis of the data allows to establish quantitative
relationships among them, providing for the first time strong experimental
indication that the underlying fragmentation mechanisms are all driven by a
common physical process.

cool transition region loops. This class of loops has received little attention
in the literature. A cluster of such loops was observed on the solar disk in
active region NOAA11934, in the Si IV 1402.8 \AA\ spectral raster and 1400 \AA\
slit-jaw (SJ) images. We divide the loops into three groups and study their
dynamics and interaction. The first group comprises relatively stable loops,
with 382--626\,km cross-sections. Observed Doppler velocities are suggestive of
siphon flows, gradually changing from -10 km/s at one end to 20 km/s at the
other end of the loops. Nonthermal velocities from 15 to 25 km/s were
determined. These physical properties suggest that these loops are impulsively
heated by magnetic reconnection occurring at the blue-shifted footpoints where
magnetic cancellation with a rate of $10^{15}$ Mx/s is found. The released
magnetic energy is redistributed by the siphon flows. The second group
corresponds to two footpoints rooted in mixed-magnetic-polarity regions, where
magnetic cancellation occurred at a rate of $10^{15}$ Mx/s and line profiles
with enhanced wings of up to 200 km/s were observed. These are suggestive of
explosive-like events. The Doppler velocities combined with the SJ images
suggest possible anti-parallel flows in finer loop strands. In the third group,
interaction between two cool loop systems is observed. Evidence for magnetic
reconnection between the two loop systems is reflected in the line profiles of
explosive events, and a magnetic cancellation rate of $3\times10^{15}$ Mx/s
observed in the corresponding area. The IRIS observations have thus opened a
new window of opportunity for in-depth investigations of cool transition region
loops. Further numerical experiments are crucial for understanding their
physics and their role in the coronal heating processes.

Bi-directional FMT* (BFMT*) that extends the Fast Marching Tree (FMT*)
algorithm to bi-directional search while preserving its key properties, chiefly
lazy search and asymptotic optimality through convergence in probability. BFMT*
performs a two-source, lazy dynamic programming recursion over a set of
randomly-drawn samples, correspondingly generating two search trees: one in

detectable via periodic variability (or nanohertz frequency gravitational
waves). Following our detection of a 5.2 year periodic signal in the quasar PG
1302-102 (Graham et al. 2015), we present a novel analysis of the optical
variability of 243,500 known spectroscopically confirmed quasars using data
from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) to look for close (< 0.1
pc) SMBH systems. Looking for a strong Keplerian periodic signal with at least
1.5 cycles over a baseline of nine years, we find a sample of 111 candidate
objects. This is in conservative agreement with theoretical predictions from
models of binary SMBH populations. Simulated data sets, assuming stochastic
variability, also produce no equivalent candidates implying a low likelihood of
spurious detections. The periodicity seen is likely attributable to either jet
precession, warped accretion disks or periodic accretion associated with a
close SMBH binary system. We also consider how other SMBH binary candidates in
the literature appear in CRTS data and show that none of these are equivalent
to the identified objects. Finally, the distribution of objects found is
consistent with that expected from a gravitational wave-driven population. This
implies that circumbinary gas is present at small orbital radii and is being
perturbed by the black holes. None of the sources is expected to merge within
at least the next century. This study opens a new unique window to study a
population of close SMBH binaries that must exist according to our current
understanding of galaxy and SMBH evolution.

approach, and find good qualitative and quantitative agreement with our

BdG spectrum of the dark solitons, using perturbation theory, and obtain a
quantitative match with our 3D BdG numerical calculations. We then turn our
attention to the emergence of single- and multi-vortex-ring states. We
systematically capture these as stationary states of the system and quantify
their BdG spectra numerically. We find that although the vortex ring may be
unstable when bifurcating, its instabilities weaken and may even eventually
disappear, for sufficiently large chemical potentials and suitable trap
settings. For instance, we demonstrate the stability of the vortex ring for an
isotropic trap in the large chemical potential regime.

the Kahler potential and the gauge kinetic function are employed at tree level.
The MSSM gaugino masses are radiatively generated through the gauge mediation.
Since a ""focus point"" of the soft Higgs mass parameter, m_{h_u}^2 appears
around 3-4 TeV energy scale in this case, m_{h_u}^2 is quite insensitive to
stop masses. Instead, the naturalness of the small m_{h_u}^2 is more closely
associated with the gluino mass rather than the stop mass unlike the
conventional scenario. As a result, even a 3-4 TeV stop mass, which is known to
explain the 125 GeV Higgs mass at three-loop level, can still be compatible
with the naturalness of the electroweak scale. On the other hand, the
requirements of various fine-tuning measures much smaller than 100 and |\mu| <
600 GeV constrain the gluino mass to be 1.6 TeV < M_3 < 2.2 TeV, which is
well-inside the discovery potential range of LHC RunII.

of candidate star clusters in NGC 1023, an early-type galaxy at a distance of

intermediate-age stars dominate the light of the remaining 8%. Theory predicts
that clusters with such ages can host intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs)
with masses M_BH \lesssim 10^5 M_sun. To investigate this prediction, we used
264 s of 5.5 GHz data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to search
for the radiative signatures of IMBH accretion from 337 candidate clusters in
an image spanning 492 arcsec (26 kpc) with a resolution of 0.40 arcsec (22 pc).
None of the individual clusters are detected, nor are weighted-mean image
stacks of the 311 old clusters, the 26 intermediate-age clusters, and the 20
clusters with stellar masses M_star \gtrsim 7.5 x 10^5 M_sun. The clusters thus
lack radio analogs of HLX-1, a strong IMBH candidate in a cluster in the
early-type galaxy ESO 243-49. This suggests that HLX-1 is accreting gas related
to its cluster's light-dominating young stars. Alternatively, the HLX-1
phenomenon could be so rare that no radio analog is expected in NGC 1023. Also,
using a formalism heretofore applied to star clusters in the Milky Way, the
radio-luminosity upper limit for the massive-cluster stack corresponds to a
mean 3$\sigma$ IMBH mass of M_BH(massive) < 2.3 x 10^5 M_sun, suggesting mean
black-hole mass fractions of M_BH(massive)/M_star < 0.05-0.29.

probability of erasing specific connected structures. It has been inspired by
the recent interest on the existence of other universality classes of
percolation models. The exact scale invariance and renormalization properties
of DHL leads to recurrence maps, from which analytical expressions for the
critical exponents and precise numerical results in the limit of very large
lattices can be derived. The critical exponents $\nu$ and $\beta$ of the
investigated model vary continuously as the erasing probability changes. An
adequate choice of the erasing probability leads to the result $\nu=\infty$,
like in some phase transitions involving vortex formation. The percolation
transition is continuous, with $\beta>0$, but $\beta$ can be as small as
desired. The modified percolation model turns out to be equivalent to the

spheroidal (dSph) galaxies in the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies based on
revised axisymmetric mass models from our previous work. The models we adopt
here fully take into account velocity anisotropy of tracer stars confined
within a flattened dark halo. Applying our models to the available kinematic
data of the 12 bright dSphs, we find that these galaxies associate with, in
general, elongated dark halos, even considering the effect of this velocity
anisotropy of stars. We also find that the best-fit parameters, especially for
the shapes of dark halos and velocity anisotropy, are susceptible to both the
availability of velocity data in the outer regions and the effect of the lack
of sample stars in each spatial bin. Thus, to obtain more realistic limits on
dark halo structures, we require photometric and kinematic data over much
larger areas in the dSphs than previously explored. The results obtained from
the currently available data suggest that the shapes of dark halos in the dSphs
are more elongated than those of $\Lambda$CDM subhalos. This mismatch needs to
be solved by theory including baryon components and the associated feedback to
dark halos as well as by further observational limits in larger areas of dSphs.
It is also found that more diffuse dark halos may have undergone consecutive
star formation history, thereby implying that dark-halo structure plays an
important role in star formation activity.

networks but rather by sets of interdependent ones. In these specific networks,
nodes in one network mutually interact with nodes in other networks. This paper
focuses on a simple representative case of two-layer networks (the so-called
duplex networks) with unidirectional inter-layer couplings. That is, each node
in one network depends on a counterpart in the other network. Accordingly, the
former network is called the response layer and the latter network is the drive
layer. Specifically, synchronization between each node in the drive layer and
its counterpart in the response layer (counterpart synchronization, or CS) of
this sort of duplex networks with delayed nodes and noise perturbation is
investigated. Based on the LaSalle-type invariance principle, a control
technique is proposed and a sufficient condition is developed for realizing
counterpart synchronization of duplex networks. Furthermore, two corollaries
are derived as special cases. In addition, node dynamics within each layer can
be various and topologies of the two layers are not necessarily identical.
Therefore, the proposed synchronization method can be applied to a wide range
of multiplex networks. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the results.

multipermutation codes. Multipermutations are permutations of a multiset that
generally consist of duplicate entries. We first introduce a class of binary
matrices called multipermutation matrices, each of which corresponds to a
unique and distinct multipermutation. By enforcing a set of linear constraints
on these matrices, we define a new class of codes that we term LP-decodable
multipermutation codes. In order to decode these codes using a linear program
(LP), thereby enabling soft decoding, we characterize the convex hull of
multipermutation matrices. This characterization allows us to relax the coding
constraints to a polytope and to derive two LP decoding problems. These two
problems are respectively formulated by relaxing the maximum likelihood
decoding problem and the minimum Chebyshev distance decoding problem.
  Because these codes are non-linear, we also study efficient encoding and
decoding algorithms. We first describe an algorithm that maps consecutive
integers, one by one, to an ordered list of multipermutations. Based on this
algorithm, we develop an encoding algorithm for a code proposed by Shieh and
Tsai, a code that falls into our class of LP-decodable multipermutation codes.
Regarding decoding algorithms, we propose an efficient distributed decoding
algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
Finally, we observe from simulation results that the soft decoding techniques
we introduce can significantly outperform hard decoding techniques that are
based on quantized channel outputs.

the TMDs makes the spin index locked to the valley index, which has some
interesting consequences such as the magnetoelectric effects in 2H bilayers13.
A direct experimental characterization of the spin-valley coupled electronic

quantum interference involving the Q-valleys in the conduction band due to
spin-conserved scattering processes, while spin-flip intervalley scattering is
absent. This experiment establishes unequivocally the presence of spin-valley
coupling and affirms the large spin-splitting at the Q valleys. Importantly,
the inefficient spin-flip intervalley scattering implies long valley and spin
lifetime in ML WSe2, which represents a key figure of merit for
valley-spintronic applications.

dynamics of a toy two species ecosystem modelled as a discrete time Kolmogorov

compete with each other for obtaining growth resources, mediated through inter

Numerical simulations reveal the transition from regular to irregular dynamics

Restricting ourselves to the case of homogeneous expansion, we analyze disorder
dependence of GL expansion coefficients on disorder for the wide range of
attractive potentials U, from weak BCS coupling region to the strong coupling
limit, where superconductivity is described by Bose - Einstein condensation
(BEC) of preformed Cooper pairs. We show, that for the case of semi - elliptic
""bare"" density of states of conduction band, disorder influence on GL
coefficients A and B before quadratic and fourth -- order terms of the order
parameter, as well as on the specific heat discontinuity at superconducting
transition, is of universal nature at any strength of attractive interaction
and is related only to the general widening of the conduction band by disorder.
In general, disorder growth increases the values of coefficients A and B,
leading either to the suppression of specific heat discontinuity (in the weak
coupling limit), or to its significant growth (in the strong coupling region).
However, this behavior actually confirms the validity of the generalized
Anderson theorem, as disorder dependence of superconducting critical
temperature T_c, is also controlled only by disorder widening of conduction
band (density of states).

or three-dimensional quantum Hall and topological insulator systems. A hallmark
of these systems is topological protection, i.e. the existence of propagative
edge states that cannot be scattered by imperfections or disorder in the
system. A different and less explored form of robust transport arises in
non-Hermitian systems in the presence of an {\it imaginary} gauge field. As
compared to topologically-protected transport in quantum Hall and topological
insulator systems, robust non-Hermitian transport can be observed in {\it
lower} dimensional (i.e. one dimensional) systems. In this work the transport
properties of one-dimensional tight-binding lattices with an imaginary gauge
field are theoretically investigated, and the physical mechanism underlying
robust one-way transport is highlighted. Back scattering is here forbidden
because reflected waves are evanescent rather than propagative. Remarkably, the
spectral transmission of the non-Hermitian lattice is shown to be mapped into
the one of the corresponding Hermitian lattice, i.e. without the gauge field,
{\it but} computed in the complex plane. In particular, at large values of the
gauge field the spectral transmittance becomes equal to one, even in the
presence of disorder or lattice imperfections. This phenomenon can be referred
to as {\it one-way non-Hermitian transparency}. Robust one-way transport can be
also realized in a more realistic setting, namely in heterostructure systems,
in which a non-Hermitian disordered lattice is embedded between two homogeneous
Hermitian lattices. Such a double heterostructure realizes asymmetric
(non-reciprocal) wave transmission. A physical implementation of non-Hermtian
transparency, based on light transport in a chain of optical microring
resonators, is suggested.

  systems with thermodynamic inertia","12 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Validity of local equilibrium has been questioned for non-equilibrium systems
which are characterized by delayed response. In particular, for systems with
non-zero thermodynamic inertia, the assumption of local equilibrium leads to
negative values of the entropy production, which is in contradiction with the
second law of thermodynamics. In this paper we address this question by
suggesting a variational formulation of irreversible evolution of a system with
non-zero thermodynamic inertia. We introduce the Lagrangian, which depends on
the properties of the normal and the so-called ""mirror-image"" systems. We show
that the standard evolution equations, in particular the
Maxwell-Cattaneo-Vernotte equation, can be derived from the variational
procedure without going beyond the assumption of local equilibrium. We also
argue, that the second law of thermodynamics should be understood as a
consequence of the variational procedure and the property of local equilibrium.
For systems with instantaneous response this leads to the standard requirement
of the local instantaneous entropy production being always positive. However,
if a system is characterized by delayed response, the formulation of the second
law of thermodynamics should be altered. In particular, the quantity, which is
always positive, is not the instantaneous entropy production, but the entropy
production averaged over the period of the heat wave.

resonance) and long or multiple rebrightenings are the best distinguishing
properties of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. We provided the updated list of nearly
100 WZ Sge-type dwarf novae mainly based on the data obtained by the VSNET
Collaboration up to Kato et al. (2015, arXiv/1507.05610) and discussed the
statistics. We could detect early superhumps with amplitude larger than 0.02
mag in 63% of the studied WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, which makes early superhumps
a useful distinguishing feature for WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. Theoretical light
curves of early superhumps generally appear to reproduce the existence of many
low-amplitude objects, supporting the geometrical origin of early superhumps.
Using the recently developed method of measuring mass ratios using developing
phase of superhumps (stage A superhumps), we showed that there is a linear
relation between the period variation of superhumps and the mass ratio in WZ
Sge-type objects. By using this relation, we were able to draw an evolutionary
picture of a large number of WZ Sge-type and identified the type of outburst to
be an evolutionary sequence: type C->D->A->B->E, with some outliers for type-B
objects. The duration of stage A (evolutionary phase) of superhumps is also
well correlated with the estimated mass ratios. By using mass ratios from stage
A superhumps and durarion of stage A, we have been able to identify best
candidates for period bouncers.

samples which often display stress-relaxation features in the form of wrinkles.
Wrinkles of graphene on Ir(111) are found to exhibit a fairly well ordered
interconnecting network which is characterized by low-energy electron
microscopy (LEEM). The high degree of quasi-hexagonal network arrangement for
the graphene aligned to the underlying substrate can be well described as a
(non-Poissonian) Voronoi partition of a plane. The results obtained strongly
suggest that the wrinkle network is frustrated at low temperatures, retaining
the order inherited from elevated temperatures when the wrinkles interconnect
in junctions which most often join three wrinkles. Such frustration favors the
formation of multi-lobed wrinkles which are found in scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) measurements. The existence of multiple lobes is explained
within a model accounting for the interplay of the van der Waals attraction
between graphene and iridium and bending energy of the wrinkle. The presented
study provides new insights into wrinkling of epitaxial graphene and can be
exploited to further expedite its application.

background radiation arises entirely from high redshift quasars and other
active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The low optical depth to Thomson scattering
reported by the Planck Collaboration pushes the redshift of instantaneous
reionization down to z=8.8^{+1.7}_{-1.4} and greatly reduces the need for
significant Lyman-continuum emission at very early times. We show that, if
recent claims of a numerous population of faint AGNs at z=4-6 are upheld, and
the high inferred AGN comoving emissivity at these epochs persists to higher,
z~10, redshifts, then active galaxies may drive the reionization of hydrogen
and helium with little contribution from normal star-forming galaxies. We
discuss an AGN-dominated scenario that satisfies a number of observational
constraints: the HI photoionization rate is relatively flat over the range
2<z<5, hydrogen gets fully reionized by z=5.7, and the integrated Thomson
scattering optical depth is tau=0.056, in agreement with measurements based on
the Lya opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and cosmic microwave
background (CMB) polarization. It is a prediction of the model that helium gets
doubly reionized before redshift 4, the heat input from helium reionization
dominates the thermal balance of the IGM after hydrogen reionization, and z>5
AGNs provide a significant fraction of the unresolved X-ray background at 2
keV. Singly- and doubly-ionized helium contribute about 13% to tau, and the
HeIII volume fraction is already 50% when hydrogen becomes fully reionized.

systems such as recurrent neural networks. This algorithm works in an online,
memoryless setting, thus requiring no backpropagation through time, and is
scalable, avoiding the large computational and memory cost of maintaining the
full gradient of the current state with respect to the parameters.
  The algorithm essentially maintains, at each time, a single search direction
in parameter space. The evolution of this search direction is partly stochastic
and is constructed in such a way to provide, at every time, an unbiased random
estimate of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.
Because the gradient estimate is unbiased, on average over time the parameter
is updated as it should.
  The resulting gradient estimate can then be fed to a lightweight Kalman-like
filter to yield an improved algorithm. For recurrent neural networks, the
resulting algorithms scale linearly with the number of parameters.
  Small-scale experiments confirm the suitability of the approach, showing that
the stochastic approximation of the gradient introduced in the algorithm is not
detrimental to learning. In particular, the Kalman-like version of NoBackTrack
is superior to backpropagation through time (BPTT) when the time span of
dependencies in the data is longer than the truncation span for BPTT.

interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) community, where it is used as a
method to control a single agent in a system composed of multiple agents with
unknown behaviours. The idea is to hypothesise a set of types, each specifying
a possible behaviour for the other agents, and to plan our own actions with
respect to those types which we believe are most likely, given the observed
actions of the agents. The game theory literature studies this idea primarily
in the context of equilibrium attainment. In contrast, many AI applications
have a focus on task completion and payoff maximisation. With this perspective
in mind, we identify and address a spectrum of questions pertaining to belief
and truth in hypothesised types. We formulate three basic ways to incorporate
evidence into posterior beliefs and show when the resulting beliefs are
correct, and when they may fail to be correct. Moreover, we demonstrate that
prior beliefs can have a significant impact on our ability to maximise payoffs
in the long-term, and that they can be computed automatically with consistent
performance effects. Furthermore, we analyse the conditions under which we are
able complete our task optimally, despite inaccuracies in the hypothesised
types. Finally, we show how the correctness of hypothesised types can be
ascertained during the interaction via an automated statistical analysis.

biological meaning of this phenomenon, known as codon usage bias, is still
controversial. In order to shed light on this point, we propose a new codon
bias index, $CompAI$, that is based on the competition between cognate and
near-cognate tRNAs during translation, without being tuned to the usage bias of
highly expressed genes. We perform a genome-wide evaluation of codon bias for
$E.coli$, comparing $CompAI$ with other widely used indices: $tAI$, $CAI$, and
$Nc$. We show that $CompAI$ and $tAI$ capture similar information by being
positively correlated with gene conservation, measured by ERI, and
essentiality, whereas, $CAI$ and $Nc$ appear to be less sensitive to
evolutionary-functional parameters. Notably, the rate of variation of $tAI$ and
$CompAI$ with ERI allows to obtain sets of genes that consistently belong to
specific clusters of orthologous genes (COGs). We also investigate the
correlation of codon bias at the genomic level with the network features of
protein-protein interactions in $E.coli$. We find that the most densely
connected communities of the network share a similar level of codon bias (as
measured by $CompAI$ and $tAI$). Conversely, a small difference in codon bias
between two genes is, statistically, a prerequisite for the corresponding
proteins to interact. Importantly, among all codon bias indices, $CompAI$ turns
out to have the most coherent distribution over the communities of the
interactome, pointing to the significance of competition among cognate and
near-cognate tRNAs for explaining codon usage adaptation.

wider, fainter and higher resolution and also a longer wavelength range than

compare their properties. Since there is no dedicated article on the VST ATLAS

survey. This easily fits onto our other main focus which is to compare
overlapping Southern Surveys and see how they best fit with the available NIR

North in terms of multiwavelength imaging. However we note that the South has
more limited opportunities for spectroscopic follow-up and this weakness will
persist during the LSST era. Some new perspectives are offered on this and

on the exchange of mutual interference among operators, rather than of decoded
data, to let every operator to recover an augmented degree of diversity either
for channel estimation and multi-user detection. In xDSL scenario where
multiple operators share the same cable binder the interference-cooperation
(IC) approach outperforms data-exchange methods and preserves to certain degree
the privacy of the users as signals can be tailored to prevent each operator to

  The IC method is based on Expectation Maximization estimation shaped to
account for the degree of information that each operator can exchange with the
others during the two steps of multi-user channel estimation and multi-user
detection. Convergence of IC is guaranteed into few iterations and it does not
depend on the structure of the interference. IC performance attains those of
centralized receivers (i.e., one fusion-center that collects all the received

novel and general framework, denoted as Hierarchical Rate Splitting (HRS), that
is particularly suited to FDD massive MIMO systems. HRS simultaneously
transmits private messages intended to each user and two kinds of common
messages that can be decoded by all users and by a subset of users,

Spatially damped
propagating sausage waves were recently observed in the solar atmosphere. We
examine how wave leakage influences the spatial damping of sausage waves
propagating along coronal structures modeled by a cylindrical density
enhancement embedded in a uniform magnetic field. Working in the framework of
cold magnetohydrodynamics, we solve the dispersion relation (DR) governing
sausage waves for complex-valued longitudinal wavenumber $k$ at given real
angular frequencies $\omega$. For validation purposes, we also provide
analytical approximations to the DR in the low-frequency limit and in the
vicinity of $\omega_{\rm c}$, the critical angular frequency separating trapped
from leaky waves. In contrast to the standing case, propagating sausage waves
are allowed for $\omega$ much lower than $\omega_{\rm c}$. However, while able
to direct their energy upwards, these low-frequency waves are subject to
substantial spatial attenuation. The spatial damping length shows little
dependence on the density contrast between the cylinder and its surroundings,
and depends only weakly on frequency. This spatial damping length is of the
order of the cylinder radius for $\omega \lesssim 1.5 v_{\rm Ai}/a$, where $a$
and $v_{\rm Ai}$ are the cylinder radius and the Alfv\'en speed in the
cylinder, respectively. We conclude that if a coronal cylinder is perturbed by
symmetric boundary drivers (e.g., granular motions) with a broadband spectrum,
wave leakage efficiently filters out the low-frequency components.

arborescences $\mathsf{arb}(G)$ of a digraph then define the Kirchhoff
polynomial $\sum_{A \in \mathsf{arb}(G)} \prod_{e\in A} e$. We show how to
compute a compact representation of the Kirchhoff polynomial -- its prime
factorization, and how it relates to combinatorial properties of digraphs such
as strong connectivity and vertex domination. In particular, we provide digraph
decomposition rules that correspond to factorization steps of the polynomial,
and also give necessary and sufficient primality conditions of the resulting
factors expressed by connectivity properties of the corresponding decomposed
components. Thereby, we obtain a linear time algorithm for decomposing a
digraph into components corresponding to factors of the initial polynomial, and
a guarantee that no finer factorization is possible. The decomposition serves
as a starting point for a recursive deletion-contraction algorithm, and also as
a preprocessing phase for iterative enumeration algorithms. Both approaches
produce a compressed output and retain some structural properties in the
resulting polynomial. This proves advantageous in practical applications such
as calculating steady states on digraphs governed by Laplacian dynamics, or
computing the greatest common divisor of Kirchhoff polynomials. Finally, we
initiate the study of a class of digraphs which allow for a practical
enumeration of arborescences. Using our decomposition rules we observe that
various digraphs from real-world applications fall into this class or are

product expansion (OPE) of an arbitrary number of composite operators in the
context of perturbative, Euclidean quantum field theory in four dimensions. Our
iterative scheme is consistent with previous definitions of OPE coefficients
via the flow equation method, or methods based on Feynman diagrams. It allows
us to prove that a strong version of the ""associativity"" condition holds for
the OPE to arbitrary orders in perturbation theory. Such a condition was
previously proposed in an axiomatic setting in [1] and has interesting
conceptual consequences: 1) One can characterise perturbations of quantum field
theories abstractly in a sort of ""Hochschild-like"" cohomology setting, 2) one
can prove a ""coherence theorem"" analogous to that in an ordinary algebra: The
OPE coefficients for a product of two composite operators uniquely determine
those for $n$ composite operators. We concretely prove our main results for the
Euclidean $\varphi^4_4$ quantum field theory, covering also the massless case.
Our methods are rather general, however, and would also apply to other, more
involved, theories such as Yang-Mills theories.

a test-bed for atmospheric and evolutionary models for esdM objects.
  We determine abundances primarily using high resolution optical spectra of
the primary. Other parameters were determined from the fits of synthetic
spectra computed with these abundances to the observed spectra from 0.4 to 2.5

  We determine \Tef =4625 $\pm$ 100 K, \logg = 4.5 $\pm$ 0.5 for the A

  Abundances of elements in \ga and \gb atmospheres cannot be described by one
metallicity parameter. The offset of $\sim$ 0.4 dex between the abundances
derived from alpha element and iron group elements corresponds with our
expectation for metal-deficient stars. We thus clarify that some indices used
to date to measure metallicities for establishing esdM stars based on CaH, MgH
and TiO band system strength ratios in the optical and H$_2$O in the infrared
relate to abundances of alpha-element group rather than to iron peak elements.
For metal deficient M dwarfs with [Fe/H] < -1.0, this provides a ready
explanation for apparently inconsistent ""metallicities"" derived using different
methods.

Whereas many new genes arise by gene duplication, others originate at genomic
regions that do not contain any gene or gene copy. Some of these newly
expressed genes may acquire coding or non-coding functions and be preserved by
natural selection. However, it is yet unclear which is the prevalence and
underlying mechanisms of de novo gene emergence. In order to obtain a
comprehensive view of this process we have performed in-depth sequencing of the
transcriptomes of four mammalian species, human, chimpanzee, macaque and mouse,
and subsequently compared the assembled transcripts and the corresponding
syntenic genomic regions. This has resulted in the identification of over five
thousand new transcriptional multiexonic events in human and/or chimpanzee that
are not observed in the rest of species. By comparative genomics we show that
the expression of these transcripts is associated with the gain of regulatory
motifs upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and of U1 snRNP sites
downstream of the TSS. We also find that the coding potential of the new genes
is higher than expected by chance, consistent with the presence of
protein-coding genes in the dataset. Using available human tissue proteomics
and ribosome profiling data we identify several de novo genes with translation
evidence. These genes show significant purifying selection signatures,
indicating that they are probably functional. Taken together, the data supports
a model in which frequently-occurring new transcriptional events in the genome
provide the raw material for the evolution of new proteins.

permits realizations via both pre- and post-selection. We develop the

give a precise definition of time-reversal symmetry, emphasizing a previously

concluded that the number of non-degenerate equilibria in the gravitational
field of an asteroid varies in pairs and is an odd number. In addition, the
conserved quantity can also restrict the kinds of bifurcations of relative
equilibria in the gravitational potential of an asteroid when the parameter
varies. Furthermore, studies have shown that there exist transcritical
bifurcations, quasi-transcritical bifurcations, saddle-node bifurcations,
saddle-saddle bifurcations, binary saddle-node bifurcations, supercritical
pitchfork bifurcations, and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations for the relative
equilibria in the gravitational potential of asteroids. It is found that for
the asteroid 216 Kleopatra, when the rotation period varies as a parameter, the
number of relative equilibria changes from 7 to 5 to 3 to 1, and the
bifurcations for the relative equilibria are saddle-node bifurcations and

magnetic field in a plasma, accompanied by the violent release of energy and
particle acceleration. Reconnection is as ubiquitous as plasmas themselves,
with solar flares perhaps the most popular example. Over the last few years,
the theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in large-scale fluid
systems has undergone a major paradigm shift. The steady-state model of
reconnection described by the famous Sweet-Parker (SP) theory, which dominated
the field for ~50 years, has been replaced with an essentially time-dependent,
bursty picture of the reconnection layer, dominated by the continuous formation
and ejection of multiple secondary islands (plasmoids). Whereas in the SP model
reconnection was predicted to be slow, a major implication of this new paradigm
is that reconnection in fluid systems is fast (i.e., independent of the
Lundquist number), provided that the system is large enough. This conceptual
shift hinges on the realization that SP-like current layers are violently
unstable to the plasmoid instability - implying, therefore, that such current
sheets are super-critically unstable and thus can never form in the first
place. This suggests that the formation of a current sheet and the subsequent
reconnection process cannot be decoupled, as is commonly assumed. This paper
provides an introductory-level overview of the recent developments in
reconnection theory and simulations that led to this essentially new framework.
We briefly discuss the role played by the plasmoid instability in selected
applications, and describe some of the outstanding challenges that remain at
the frontier of this subject. Amongst these are the analytical and numerical
extension of the plasmoid instability to (i) 3D and (ii) non-MHD regimes. New
results are reported in both cases.

measurements of surface rotation periods for tens of thousands of stars. Our
main goal is to derive ages of thousands of field stars using consistent
rotation period measurements in different gyrochronology relations. Multiple
rotation periods are interpreted as surface differential rotation (DR). We
re-analyze the sample of 24,124 Kepler stars from Reinhold et al. (2013) using
different approaches based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Each quarter
(Q1-Q14) is treated individually using a prewhitening approach. Additionally,
the full time series, and different segments thereof are analyzed. For more
than 18,500 stars our results are consistent with the rotation periods from
McQuillan et al. (2014). Thereof, more than 12,300 stars show multiple
significant peaks, which we interpret as DR. Gyrochronology ages between 100
Myr and 10 Gyr were derived for more than 17,000 stars using different
gyrochronology relations. We find a bimodal age distribution for Teff between
3200-4700 K. The derived ages reveal an empirical activity-age relation using
photometric variability as stellar activity proxy. Additionally, we found 1079
stars with extremely stable (mostly short) periods. Half of these periods may
be associated with rotation stabilized by non-eclipsing companions, the other
half might be due to pulsations. The derived gyrochronology ages are well
constrained since more than 93.0 % of the stars seem to be younger than the Sun
where calibration is most reliable. Explaining the bimodality in the age
distribution is challenging, and limits accurate stellar age predictions. The
existence of cool stars with almost constant rotation period over more than
three years of observation might be explained by synchronization with stellar
companions, or a dynamo mechanism keeping the spot configurations extremely
stable.

with respect to the channels and payload data. We develop a Bayes-optimal JCD
estimator using a recent technique based on approximate message passing. We
then present an analytical framework to study the theoretical performance of
the estimator in the large-system limit. Simulation results confirm our
analytical results, which allow the efficient evaluation of the performance of
quantized massive MIMO systems and provide insights into effective system
design.

populations never fixate to a trait, but tend to a random limit composition,
and that the distribution of compositions 'freezes' to a steady state This
final state is crucially influenced by the initial conditions. We obtain these
findings from a combined theoretical and experimental approach, using multiple
mixed subpopulations of two Pseudomonas putida strains in non-selective growth
conditions as model system. The experimental results for the population
dynamics match the theoretical predictions based on the P\'olya urn model for
all analyzed parameter regimes. In summary, we show that exponential growth
stops genetic drift. This result contrasts with previous theoretical analyses
of non-selective evolution (e.g. genetic drift), which investigated how traits
spread and eventually take over populations (fixate). Moreover, our work
highlights how deeply growth influences non-selective evolution, and how it
plays a key role in maintaining genetic variability. Consequently, it is of
particular importance in life-cycles models of periodically shrinking and
expanding populations.

broadly into two classes: First, a tight analysis of the Alicki-Fannes
continuity bounds for the conditional von Neumann entropy, reaching almost the
best possible form that depends only on the system dimension and the trace
distance of the states. Almost the same proof can be used to derive similar
continuity bounds for the relative entropy distance from a convex set of states
or positive operators. As applications we give new proofs, with tighter bounds,
of the asymptotic continuity of the relative entropy of entanglement, $E_R$,
and its regularization $E_R^\infty$, as well as of the entanglement of
formation, $E_F$. Using a novel ""quantum coupling"" of density operators, which
may be of independent interest, we extend the latter to an asymptotic
continuity bound for the regularized entanglement of formation, aka
entanglement cost, $E_C=E_F^\infty$.
  Second, analogous continuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and
conditional entropy in infinite dimensional systems under an energy constraint,
most importantly systems of multiple quantum harmonic oscillators. While
without an energy bound the entropy is discontinuous, it is well-known to be
continuous on states of bounded energy. However, a quantitative statement to
that effect seems not to have been known. Here, under some regularity
assumptions on the Hamiltonian, we find that, quite intuitively, the Gibbs
entropy at the given energy roughly takes the role of the Hilbert space
dimension in the finite-dimensional Fannes inequality.

stellar, galactic, and extragalactic astrophysics. The ability to predict
accurately the properties of these stars, however, depends on our understanding
of convection, which remains one of the key open questions in stellar
modelling. We argue that the combination of the luminosity of the AGB bump
(AGBb) and the period spacing of gravity modes (DP) during the HeCB phase,
provides us with a decisive test to discriminate between competing models of
these stars. We use the MESA, BaSTI, and PARSEC stellar evolution codes to
model a typical giant star observed by Kepler. We explore how various
near-core-mixing scenarios affect the predictions of the above-mentioned
constraints, and we find that DP depends strongly on the prescription adopted.
Moreover we show that the detailed behaviour of DP shows the signature of sharp
variations in the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, which could potentially give
additional information about near-core features. We find evidence for the AGBb
among Kepler targets, and a first comparison with observations shows that, even
if standard models are able to reproduce the luminosity distribution, no
standard model can account for satisfactorily the period spacing of HeCB stars.
Our analysis allows us to outline a candidate model to describe simultaneously
the two observed distributions: a model with a moderate overshooting region
characterized by an adiabatic thermal stratification. This prescription will be
tested in the future on cluster stars, to limit possible observational biases.

reconstruction using long-time series from 35 stations over 1945-2015, which

the Locarno pilot station. We also verify the scale of the resulting 1981-2015
correction factor relative to the preceding period 1945--1980. By comparing the
new $S_N$ and $G_N$ series, we find that a constant quadratic relation exists
between those two indices. This proxy relation leads to a fully constant and
cycle-independent $S_N/G_N$ ratio over cycles 19 to 23, with the exception of

daily life railway transportation in a two- fold manner: (1) by providing
automatic algorithms that can process large imagery of trains (2) by helping
train operators to keep attention on any possible malfunction. The system is
designed with the latest cutting edge, high-rate visible and thermal cameras
that ob- serve a train passing under an railway overhead gantry. The machine
vision system is composed of three principal modules: (1) an automatic wagon
identification system, recognizing the wagon ID according to the UIC
classification of railway coaches; (2) a temperature monitoring system; (3) a
system for the detection, localization and visualization of the pantograph of
the train. These three machine vision modules process batch trains sequences
and their resulting analysis are presented to an operator using a multitouch
user interface. We detail all technical aspects of our multi-camera portal: the
hardware requirements, the software developed to deal with the high-frame rate
cameras and ensure reliable acquisition, the algorithms proposed to solve each
computer vision task, and the multitouch interaction and visualization
interface. We evaluate each component of our system on a dataset recorded in an
ad-hoc railway test-bed, showing the potential of our proposed portal for train

an uphill task for developers. As a result, tools like VMWare, Hyper V
(hypervisor) started making inroads into the software repository on different
operating systems. VMWare and Hyper V could support multiple virtual machines
running on them with each having their own isolated environment. Due to this
isolation, the security aspects of virtual machines (VMs) did not differ much
from that of physical machines (having a dedicated operating system on
hardware). The advancement made in the domain of linux containers (LXC) has
taken virtualization to an altogether different level where resource
utilization by various applications has been further optimized. But the

a simple expression in terms of Pl\""ucker coordinates, see [MarshRietsch]. From
a given plabic graph $G$ we obtain two coordinate systems: using work of
Postnikov and Talaska we have a positive chart
$\Phi_G:(\mathbb{C}^*)^{k(n-k)}\to \mathbb X$ in our $A$-model, and using work

of positive integer $r$, we associate a polytope $NO_G^r$, which we construct
as the convex hull of a set of integer lattice points. This polytope is an
example of a Newton-Okounkov polytope associated to the line bundle $\mathcal
O(r)$ on $\mathbb X$. On the other hand, using the cluster chart

theoretical challenges in modeling the nonlinear bispectrum. First, we test the
robustness of the matter bispectrum measured from N-body simulations using
different initial conditions generators. We run a suite of N-body simulations
using the Zel'dovich approximation and second-order Lagrangian perturbation
theory (2LPT) at different starting redshifts, and find that transients from
initial decaying modes systematically reduce the nonlinearities in the matter
bispectrum. To achieve 1% accuracy in the matter bispectrum for $z\le3$ on
scales $k<1$ $h$/Mpc, 2LPT initial conditions generator with initial redshift
of $z\gtrsim100$ is required. We then compare various analytical formulas and
empirical fitting functions for modeling the nonlinear matter bispectrum, and
discuss the regimes for which each is valid. We find that the next-to-leading
order (one-loop) correction from standard perturbation theory matches with
N-body results on quasi-linear scales for $z\ge1$. We find that the fitting
formula in Gil-Mar\'{\i}n et al. (2012) accurately predicts the matter
bispectrum for $z\le1$ on a wide range of scales, but at higher redshifts, the
fitting formula given in Scoccimarro & Couchman (2001) gives the best agreement

is the case of bag-of-word language models. This approach has certainly yielded
reasonable performance. However, some potential features such as the structural
organization of texts have been used only on a few studies. In this context, we
probe how features derived from textual structure analysis can be effectively

classification aiming at discriminating informative from imaginative documents.
Using a networked model that describes the local topological/dynamical
properties of function words, we achieved an accuracy rate of up to 95%, which
is much higher than similar networked approaches. A systematic analysis of

$d$-dimensional spacetime is foliated by two families of intersecting null
hyper surfaces (i.e. surfaces whose normal vectors are null) of $(d-1)$
dimensions. Their intersection is at space like surfaces of dimension $(d-2)$.
This means that the leaves of this foliation are the space like surfaces of two
dimensions lower than that of spacetime which are located by looking at the
bundles of light rays that are going into, and emanating from them. Using this
foliation, we present a reformulation of the theory which makes explicit the
true dynamical degrees of freedom. This is accompanied by making manifest a
hidden local conformal invariance. Revealing this local symmetry comes at the
cost of preferring a parameterisation of the null hyper surfaces. More
precisely, a preferred ruling of the null surfaces by their generators needs to
be chosen so that the theory whose gauge symmetries are enhanced by Weyl
invariance restricted to preserve the foliation, is equivalent to general
relativity.
  I therefore find a dual theory that is locally equivalent to general
relativity but possessing enhanced local gauge symmetries: Weyl local scale
invariance and diffeomorphism invariance, both of which are restricted to
preserve the two families of null surfaces. This theory is constructed
employing the so called symmetry trading algorithm, which shall be described in
detail in this essay. Alternatively, the theory can also be seen as a `phase'
of a particular Scalar-Tensor theory, because it is equivalent to a particular

we investigate thermodynamic properties of charged BTZ black holes. We apply
the standard method to calculate the heat capacity and the Hessian matrix and
find that thermal stability of charged BTZ solutions depends on the choice of
ensemble. To overcome this problem, we take into account cosmological constant
as a thermodynamical variable. By this modification, we show that the ensemble
dependency is eliminated and thermal stability conditions are the same in both
ensembles. Then, we generalize our solutions to the case of nonlinear
electrodynamics. We show how nonlinear matter field modifies the geometrical
behavior of the metric function. We also study phase transition and thermal
stability of these black holes in context of both canonical and grand canonical
ensembles. We show that by considering the cosmological constant as a
thermodynamical variable and modifying the Hessian matrix, the ensemble
dependency of thermal stability will be eliminated.

polynomials on the real line. These polynomials satisfy the following relation:
$(J_5 - \lambda J_3) \vec p(\lambda) = 0$, where $J_3$ is a Jacobi matrix and
$J_5$ is a semi-infinite real symmetric five-diagonal matrix with positive
numbers on the second subdiagonal, $\vec p(\lambda) = (p_0(\lambda),
p_1(\lambda), p_2(\lambda),\cdots)^T$, the superscript $T$ means the
transposition, with the initial conditions $p_0(\lambda) = 1$, $p_1(\lambda) =
\alpha \lambda + \beta$, $\alpha > 0$, $\beta\in\mathbb{R}$. Some
orthonormality conditions for the polynomials $\{ p_n(\lambda) \}_{n=0}^\infty$
are obtained. An explicit example of such polynomials is constructed.

  lepton generations","9 pages, presented at the 27th Rencontres de Blois, France 2015",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Based on an extended time-space symmetry, a cylindrical model of
gravitational geometrical dynamics with two time-like extra-dimensions leads to
a microscopic geodesic description of the curved space-time. Due to interaction
of a Higgs-like cosmological potential with individual space-time fluctuations,
the original time-space symmetry is spontaneously broken, inducing a strong
time-like curvature and a weak space-like deviation curve. As a result, the
basic Klein-Gordon-Fock equation of a free massive elementary particle was
derived, which implies a duality between the quantum mechanics equation and a
microscopic geodesic description in the frame of general relativity.
Consequently, Heisenberg inequalities are determined explicitly by the
space-time curvatures. Moreover, extending curvatures to higher time-like
dimensional hyper-spherical surfaces than one of the basic common cylindrical
configuration, we found reasonable mass ratios of all charged leptons and
succeeded to fix the number of their generations to be three. Following to
concepts of the standard cosmological model, a possible experimental
verification of mass ratio variation is proposed.

at the bed. More recently, theoretical models have been able to reproduce
ice-stream behaviour as a consequence of the coupled dynamics of ice and
subglacial meltwater. In this paper we analyse the properties of ice streams
that form in a coupled model of ice flow and subglacial hydrology. We see that
there is a natural length scale defining ice stream separation and width. This
arises as a result of the balance between effective pressure gradients driving
meltwater away from ice streams and the enhanced water production in the
streams due to the fast ice flow. We further discuss how the model interacts
with topography and we show that small perturbations to a uniform bed have a
strong effect on where ice streams emerge in the model. However, in many cases
ice streams then evolve to be closer to the dimensions defined by the natural
length scale of the unperturbed system. The non-dimensional parameter that
defines this length scale is therefore of fundamental importance in the model.
