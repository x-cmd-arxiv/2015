distance have so far relied on the city location provided in users' profiles.
Consequently, most of the research on friendships have provided accuracy at the
city level, at best, to designate a user's location. This study analyzes a
Twitter dataset because it provides the exact geographic distance between
corresponding users. We start by introducing a strong definition of ""friend"" on
Twitter (i.e., a definition of bidirectional friendship), requiring
bidirectional communication. Next, we utilize geo-tagged mentions delivered by
users to determine their locations, where ""@username"" is contained anywhere in
the body of tweets. To provide analysis results, we first introduce a friend
counting algorithm. From the fact that Twitter users are likely to post
consecutive tweets in the static mode, we also introduce a two-stage distance
estimation algorithm. As the first of our main contributions, we verify that
the number of friends of a particular Twitter user follows a well-known
power-law distribution (i.e., a Zipf's distribution or a Pareto distribution).
Our study also provides the following newly-discovered friendship degree
related to the issue of space: The number of friends according to distance
follows a double power-law (i.e., a double Pareto law) distribution, indicating
that the probability of befriending a particular Twitter user is significantly
reduced beyond a certain geographic distance between users, termed the
separation point. Our analysis provides concrete evidence that Twitter can be a
useful platform for assigning a more accurate scalar value to the degree of
friendship between two users.

that in $k$-clustering one needs to select $k$ balls to cover the clients.

classical transport, the transported charge was shown to be quantized and
purely determined by the topology of the pump cycle, making it robust to
perturbations. On a fundamental level, the quantized charge transport can be
connected to a topological invariant, the Chern number, first introduced in the
context of the integer quantum Hall effect. A Thouless quantum pump may
therefore be regarded as a 'dynamical' version of the integer quantum Hall
effect. Here, we report on the realization of such a topological charge pump
using ultracold bosonic atoms that form a Mott insulator in a dynamically

  Approach",,,"10.1088/1361-6544/aaaf42",,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The destruction of a chaotic attractor leading to rough changes in the
dynamics of a dynamical system is studied. Local bifurcations are characterised
by a single or a pair of characteristic exponents crossing the imaginary axis.
The approach of such bifurcations in the presence of noise can be inferred from
the slowing down of the correlation decay. On the other hand, little is known
about global bifurcations involving high-dimensional attractors with positive
Lyapunov exponents.
  The global stability of chaotic attractors may be characterised by the
spectral properties of the Koopman or the transfer operators governing the
evolution of statistical ensembles. It has recently been shown that a boundary
crisis in the Lorenz flow coincides with the approach to the unit circle of the
eigenvalues of these operators associated with motions about the attractor, the
stable resonances. A second type of resonances, the unstable resonances, is
responsible for the decay of correlations and mixing on the attractor. In the
deterministic case, those cannot be expected to be affected by general boundary
crises.
  Here, however, we give an example of chaotic system in which slowing down of
the decay of correlations of some observables does occur at the approach of a
boundary crisis. The system considered is a high-dimensional, chaotic climate
model of physical relevance. Moreover, coarse-grained approximations of the
transfer operators on a reduced space, constructed from a long time series of
the system, give evidence that this behaviour is due to the approach of
unstable resonances to the unit circle. That the unstable resonances are
affected by the crisis can be physically understood from the fact that the
process responsible for the instability, the ice-albedo feedback, is also
active on the attractor. Implications regarding response theory and the design
of early-warning signals are discussed.

here after IOS-1 and IOS-2, where the latter has a Mach number twice stronger
than the former. Both shocks have impact angles of 30$^o$ in relation to the
Sun-Earth line. Lastly, we choose a frontal perpendicular shock, FPS, whose
shock normal is along the Sun-Earth line, with the same Mach number as IOS-1.
We find that, in the IOS-1 case, due to the north-south asymmetry, the
magnetotail is deflected southward, leading to a mild compression. The
geomagnetic activity observed in the nightside ionosphere is then weak. On the
other hand, in the head-on case, the FPS compresses the magnetotail from both
sides symmetrically. This compression triggers a substorm allowing a larger
amount of stored energy in the magnetotail to be released to the nightside
ionosphere, resulting in stronger geomagnetic activity. By comparing IOS-2 and
FPS, we find that, despite the IOS-2 having a larger Mach number, the FPS leads
to a larger geomagnetic response in the nightside ionosphere. As a result, we
conclude that IP shocks with similar upstream conditions, such as magnetic
field, speed, density, and Mach number, can have different geoeffectiveness,
depending on their shock normal orientation.

couplings. We first analyze the $e^+ e^- \rightarrow W^+ W^-$ process at the
future lepton collider, China's proposed Circular Electron-Positron Collider
(CEPC). We use the five kinematical angles in this process to constrain the
anomalous triple gauge couplings and relevant dimension six operators at the
CEPC up to the order of magnitude of $10^{-4}$. The most sensible information
is obtained from the distributions of the production scattering angle and the
decay azimuthal angles. We also estimate constraints at the 14 TeV LHC, with
both 300 fb$^{-1}$ and 3000 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity from the leading
lepton $p_T$ and azimuthal angle difference $\Delta \phi_{ll}$ distributions in
the di-lepton channel. The constrain is somewhat weaker, up to the order of
magnitude of $10^{-3}$. The limits on the triple gauge couplings are
complementary to those on the electroweak precision observables and Higgs
couplings. Our results show that the gap between sensitivities of the
electroweak and triple gauge boson precision can be significantly decreased to
less than one order of magnitude at the 14 TeV LHC, and that both the two
sensitivities can be further improved at the CEPC.

blunt body is investigated experimentally. Jets blowing tangentially to the
main flow allow to force the wake with variable frequency and amplitude.
Depending on the forcing conditions, two flow regimes can be distinguished.
First, in case of broadband actuation with frequencies comprising the natural
wake time scale, the convection of the jet structures enhances wake
entrainment, shortens the length of the recirculating flow and increases drag.
Secondly, at higher actuation frequencies, shear-layer deviation leads to
fluidic boat-tailing of the wake. It additionally lowers its turbulent kinetic
energy thus reducing the entrainment of momentum towards the recirculating
flow. The combination of both mechanisms produces a raise of the base pressure
and reduces the drag of the model. Both actuation regimes are characterized by
complementary velocity, pressure and drag measurements at several upstream
conditions and control parameters. By adding curved surfaces to deviate the
jets by the Coanda effect, periodic actuation is reinforced and drag reductions
of about 20% are achieved. The unsteady Coanda blowing not only intensifies the
flow deviation and the base pressure recovery but also preserves the unsteady
high-frequency forcing effect on the turbulent field. The present results
encourage further development of fluidic control to improve the aerodynamics of
road vehicles and provide a complementary insight into the relation between
wake dynamics and drag.

finite variations can leave it basically invariant at the level of detail
experimentally accessible. When designing a strategy for the analysis of
experimental data in the search for a signal predicted by a new physics model,
it appears advantageous to categorize the parameter space describing the model
according to the corresponding kinematical features of the final state. A
multi-dimensional test statistic can be used to gauge the degree of similarity
in the kinematics of different models; a clustering algorithm using that metric
may then allow the division of the space into homogeneous regions, each of
which can be successfully represented by a benchmark point. Searches targeting
those benchmark points are then guaranteed to be sensitive to a large area of
the parameter space. In this document we show a practical implementation of the
above strategy for the study of non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs in
the context of extensions of the standard model with anomalous couplings of the
Higgs bosons. A non-standard value of those couplings may significantly enhance

linear amplifier or attenuator, it is customary to use the single channel Caves
model (SC-CM). Although this model is valid in simple situations, such as the
presence of a beam splitter, it is not necessarily valid when a system with
many degrees of freedom is involved. In order to address this issue, we
consider in this paper various atomic transitions corresponding to
amplification or attenuation using the master-equation- (ME-) based approach to
model the QN and to compare the results with the SC-CM. For a four-level system
that consists of a transition producing a broad gain peak and a transition
producing an absorption dip, which results in perfect transparency at the
center, we observe a catastrophic breakdown of the SC-CM. We also show that for
a general two-level atomic system, the SC-CM does not apply, except in the
limiting case when only either amplification or attenuation exists. A special
case where the two models predict the same result is a {\Lambda}-type
three-level electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) system in which the
QN at zero detuning vanishes while the system is in the dark state. We also
study an optically pumped five-level gain EIT system which has a perfect
transparency dip superimposed on a gain profile, and yields the negative
dispersion suitable for use in enhancing the sensitivity-bandwidth product of
an interferometric gravitational wave detector. In this case, we find that, for
some set of parameters, the QN is vanishingly small at the center of the dip,
and the SC-CM agrees closely with the ME model. However, we also find that for
some other set of parameters, the SC-SM model disagrees strongly with the ME
model. All these cases illustrate a wide range of variations in the degree of
disagreement between the predictions of the SC-CM and the ME approaches.

Effective Field Theory (EFT) of Large Scale Structure. We compute Lagrangian
displacements with Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) and perform the full
non-perturbative transformation from displacement to density. When expanded up
to a given order, this transformation reproduces the standard Eulerian
Perturbation Theory (SPT) at the same order. However, the full transformation
from displacement to density also includes higher order terms. These terms
explicitly resum long wavelength motions, thus making the resulting density
field better correlated with the true non-linear density field. As a result,
the regime of validity of this approach is expected to extend that of the
Eulerian EFT, and match that of the IR-resummed Eulerian EFT. This approach
thus effectively enables a test of the IR-resummed EFT at the field level. We
estimate the size of stochastic, non-perturbative contributions to the matter
density power spectrum. We find that in our highest order calculation, at
redshift z=0 the power spectrum of the density field is reproduced with an
accuracy of 1 % (10 %) up to k=0.25 h/Mpc (k=0.46 h/Mpc). We believe that the
dominant source of the remaining error is the stochastic contribution.
Unfortunately, on these scales the stochastic term does not yet scale as $k^4$
as it does in the very low-k regime. Thus, modeling this contribution might be
challenging.

These terms limit the range over which one can trust the one-loop EFT
calculation at the 1 % level to k<0.1 h/Mpc at redshift z=0. We construct a
well motivated one parameter ansatz to fix the relative size of the one- and
two-loop counterterms using their high-k sensitivity. Although this one
parameter model is a very restrictive choice for the counterterms, it explains
the apparent scale dependence of $c_\text{s}^2$ seen in simulations. It is also
able to capture the scale dependence of the density power spectrum up to
k$\approx$ 0.3 h/Mpc at the 1 % level at redshift $z=0$. Considering a simple
scheme for the resummation of large scale motions, we find that the two loop

one-hop multi-user wireless networks by considering three fundamental wireless
network structures: Gaussian wiretap channel with helpers, Gaussian multiple
access wiretap channel, and Gaussian interference channel with secrecy
constraints. We present main enabling tools and resulting communication schemes
in an expository manner, along with key insights and design principles emerging
from them. The main achievable schemes are based on real interference
alignment, channel prefixing via cooperative jamming, and structured
signalling. Real interference alignment enables aligning the cooperative
jamming signals together with the message carrying signals at the eavesdroppers
to protect them akin to one-time-pad protecting messages in wired systems. Real
interference alignment also enables decodability at the legitimate receivers by
rendering message carrying and cooperative jamming signals separable, and
simultaneously aligning the cooperative jamming signals in the smallest
possible sub-space. The main converse techniques are based on two key lemmas
which quantify the secrecy penalty by showing that the net effect of an
eavesdropper on the system is that it eliminates one of the independent channel
inputs; and the role of a helper by developing a direct relationship between
the cooperative jamming signal of a helper and the message rate. These two
lemmas when applied according to the unique structure of individual networks
provide tight converses. Finally, we present a blind cooperative jamming scheme
for the helper network with no eavesdropper channel state information at the
transmitters that achieves the same optimal s.d.o.f. as in the case of full
eavesdropper channel state information.

theorem can be applied to a much more general class of sketching matrices than

observations of neutron stars has led to in-depth investigations of certain
approximately universal relations that can remove degeneracies in pulse profile
models. One such set of relations determines all of the multipole moments of a
neutron star just from the first three (the mass monopole, the current dipole
and the mass quadrupole moment) approximately independently of the equation of
state. These three-hair relations were found to hold in neutron stars that
rotate rigidly, as is the case in old pulsars, but neutron stars can also
rotate differentially, as is the case for proto-neutron stars and hypermassive
transient remnants of binary mergers. We here extend the three-hair relations
to differentially rotating stars for the first time with a generic rotation law
using two approximations: a weak-field scheme (an expansion in powers of the
neutron star compactness) and a perturbative differential rotation scheme (an
expansion about rigid rotation). These approximations allow us to analytically
derive approximately universal relations that allow us to determine all of the
multipole moments of a (perturbative) differentially rotating star in terms of
only the first four moments. These new four-hair relations for differentially
rotating neutron stars are found to be approximately independent of the
equation of state to a higher degree than the three-hair relations for
uniformly rotating stars. Our results can be instrumental in the development of
four-hair relations for rapidly differentially rotating stars in full General

in the multi-phase ISM, with energetics from stellar population models. We find
that stellar feedback, without ""fine-tuned"" parameters, greatly alleviates
small-scale problems in CDM. Feedback causes bursts of star formation and
outflows, altering the DM distribution. As a result, the inner slope of the DM
halo profile ($\alpha$) shows a strong mass dependence: profiles are shallow at
$M_{\rm h}\sim10^{10}-10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ and steepen at higher/lower masses.
The resulting core sizes and slopes are consistent with observations. This is
broadly consistent with previous work using simpler feedback schemes, but we
find steeper mass dependence of $\alpha$, and relatively late growth of cores.
Because the star formation efficiency $M_{\ast}/M_{\rm h}$ is strongly halo
mass dependent, a rapid change in $\alpha$ occurs around $M_{\rm h}\sim
10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$ ($M_{\ast}\sim10^{6}-10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$), as sufficient
feedback energy becomes available to perturb the DM. Large cores are not
established during the period of rapid growth of halos because of ongoing DM
mass accumulation. Instead, cores require several bursts of star formation
after the rapid buildup has completed. Stellar feedback dramatically reduces
circular velocities in the inner kpc of massive dwarfs; this could be
sufficient to explain the ""Too Big To Fail"" problem without invoking
non-standard DM. Finally, feedback and baryonic contraction in Milky Way-mass
halos produce DM profiles slightly shallower than the Navarro-Frenk-White
profile, consistent with the normalization of the observed Tully-Fisher
relation.

of gas heating and particle acceleration in cluster mergers, we investigated
the X-ray emission from CIZA J2242.8+5301, which hosts two giant radio relics
in the northern/southern part of the cluster. Methods. We analyzed data from
three-pointed Suzaku observations of CIZA J2242.8+5301 to derive the
temperature distribution in four different directions. Results: The
Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) temperature shows a remarkable drop from
8.5$_{-0.6}^{+0.8}$ keV to 2.7$_{-0.4}^{+0.7}$ keV across the northern radio
relic. The temperature drop is consistent with a Mach number ${\cal
M}_n=2.7^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$ and a shock velocity
$v_{shock:n}=2300_{-400}^{+700}\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$. We also confirm the
temperature drop across the southern radio relic. However, the ICM temperature
beyond this relic is much higher than beyond the northern one, which gives a
Mach number ${\cal M}_s=1.7^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ and shock velocity
$v_{shock:s}=2040_{-410}^{+550}\rm \,km\,s^{-1}$. These results agree with
other systems showing a relationship between the radio relics and shock fronts
which are induced by merging activity. We compare the X-ray derived Mach
numbers with the radio derived Mach numbers from the radio spectral index under
the assumption of diffusive shock acceleration in the linear test particle
regime. For the northern radio relic, the Mach numbers derived from X-ray and
radio observations agree with each other. Based on the shock velocities, we
estimate that CIZA J2242.8+5301 is observed approximately 0.6 Gyr after core
passage. The magnetic field pressure at the northern relic is estimated to be
9% of the thermal pressure.

their elusive formation process. It also sets a key initial condition for
stellar evolution and is thus an important ingredient in stellar population
synthesis. So far, most studies have focused on single stars. Most O stars are
however found in multiple systems. By establishing the spin-rate distribution
of a sizeable sample of O-type spectroscopic binaries and by comparing the
distributions of binary sub-populations with one another as well as with that
of presumed single stars in the same region, we aim to constrain the initial
spin distribution of O stars in binaries, and to identify signatures of the
physical mechanisms that affect the evolution of the massive stars spin rates.
We use ground-based optical spectroscopy obtained in the framework of the
VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS) to establish the projected equatorial
rotational velocities (\vrot) for components of 114 spectroscopic binaries in
30 Doradus. The \vrot\ values are derived from the full-width at half-maximum
(FWHM) of a set of spectral lines, using a FWHM vs. \vrot\ calibration that we
derive based on previous line analysis methods applied to single O-type stars
in the VFTS sample. The overall \vrot\ distribution of the primary stars
resembles that of single O-type stars in the VFTS, featuring a low-velocity
peak (at $\vrot < 200$ kms) and a shoulder at intermediate velocities ($200 <
\vrot < 300$ kms). The distributions of binaries and single stars however
differ in two ways. First, the main peak at $\vrot \sim$100 kms is broader and
slightly shifted toward higher spin rates in the binary distribution compared
to that of the presumed-single stars. Second, the \vrot distribution of
primaries lacks a significant population of stars spinning faster than 300 kms
while such a population is clearly present in the single star sample.

we select a sample of 35 massive, compact galaxies ($M_* = 1-3 \times 10^{11}$

original factor of 3 difference in stellar mass spreads to a factor of 20. The
dark matter halo masses similarly spread from a factor of 5 to 40. The
galaxies' evolutionary paths are diverse: about half acquire an ex-situ
envelope and are the core of a more massive descendant, a third survive
undisturbed and gain very little mass, 15% are consumed in a merger with a more
massive galaxy, and a small remainder are thoroughly mixed by major mergers.
The galaxies grow in size as well as mass, and only $\sim$10% remain compact by
$z=0$. The majority of the size growth is driven by the acquisition of ex-situ
mass. The most massive galaxies at $z=0$ are the most likely to have compact
progenitors, but this trend possesses significant dispersion which precludes a
direct linkage to compact galaxies at $z=2$. The compact galaxies' merger rates
are influenced by their $z=2$ environments, so that isolated or satellite
compact galaxies (which are protected from mergers) are the most likely to
survive to the present day.

galaxy in the Perseus Cluster. NGC 1277 has previously been proposed to host an
overmassive black hole (BH) compared to the galaxy bulge luminosity (mass),
based on stellar-kinematic measurements. The CO(1-0) emission, observed with
the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) using both, a more compact
(2.9-arcsec resolution) and a more extended (1-arcsec resolution)
configuration, is likely to originate from the dust lane encompassing the
galaxy nucleus at a distance of 0.9 arcsec (~320 pc). The double-horned CO(1-0)
profile found at 2.9-arcsec resolution traces $1.5\times 10^8\ M_\odot$ of
molecular gas, likely orbiting in the dust lane at $\sim 550\ \mathrm{km\
s^{-1}}$, which suggests a total enclosed mass of $\sim 2\times 10^{10}\
M_\odot$. At 1-arcsec resolution, the CO(1-0) emission appears spatially
resolved along the dust lane in east-west direction, though at a low
signal-to-noise ratio. In agreement with the previous stellar-kinematic
measurements, the CO(1-0) kinematics is found to be consistent with an $\sim
1.7\times 10^{10}\ M_\odot$ BH for a stellar mass-to-light ratio of
$M/L_V=6.3$, while a less massive BH of $\sim 5\times 10^{9}\ M_\odot$ is
possible when assuming a larger $M/L_V=10$. While the molecular gas reservoir
may be associated with a low level of star formation activity, the extended
2.6-mm continuum emission is likely to originate from a weak AGN, possibly
characterized by an inverted radio-to-millimetre spectral energy distribution.
Literature radio and X-ray data indicate that the BH in NGC 1277 is also
overmassive with respect to the Fundamental Plane of BH activity.

verification of a circuit $N$ by simulation can be viewed as a way to reduce
the complexity of computing the range of $N$. Instead of finding the entire
range of $N$ and checking if it contains a bad output, such a range is computed
only for one input. Simulation by CRR offers an alternative way of coping with
the complexity of range computation. The idea is to exclude a subset of inputs

example of unlinked polymer rings. How to do statistical mechanics in the
presence of such constraints remains a fundamental open problem. We study the
effect of topological constraints on a melt of directed polymers, using
simulations of a simple quasi-2D model. We find that fixing the global topology
of the melt to be trivial changes the polymer conformations drastically.
Polymers of length $L$ wander in the transverse direction only by a distance of
order $(\ln L)^\zeta$ with $\zeta \simeq 1.5$. This is strongly suppressed in
comparison with the Brownian $L^{1/2}$ scaling which holds in the absence of
the topological constraint. It is also much smaller than the predictions of
standard heuristic approaches - in particular the $L^{1/4}$ of a
mean-field-like `array of obstacles' model - so our results present a sharp
challenge to theory. Dynamics are also strongly affected by the constraints,
and a tagged monomer in an infinite system performs logarithmically slow
subdiffusion in the transverse direction. To cast light on the suppression of
the strands' wandering, we analyse the topological complexity of subregions of
the melt: the complexity is also logarithmically small, and is related to the
wandering by a power law. We comment on insights the results give for 3D melts,

systems. The H infinity norm of a system measures its robustness by quantifying
the worst-case behavior of a system perturbed by a unit-energy disturbance.
However, the disturbance that induces such worst-case behavior requires perfect
coordination among all disturbance channels. Given that many systems of
interest, such as the power grid, the internet and automated vehicle platoons,
are large-scale and spatially distributed, such coordination may not be
possible, and hence the H infinity norm, used as a measure of robustness, may
be too conservative. We therefore propose a cardinality constrained variant of
the H infinity norm in which an adversarial disturbance can use only a limited
number of channels. As this problem is inherently combinatorial, we present a
semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation based on the l1 norm that yields an
upper bound on the cardinality constrained robustness problem. We further
propose a simple rounding heuristic based on the optimal solution of SDP
relaxation which provides a lower bound. Motivated by privacy in large-scale
systems, we also extend these relaxations to computing the minimum gain of a
system subject to a limited number of inputs. Finally, we also present a SDP

$k$-clusters: a random model on $n=km$ vertices, partitioned in $k$ equal sized
clusters, with edges sampled independently across clusters with probability $q$

algorithm solves the problem of {\em exact recovery} in the $k$-community SBM,
with high probability, whenever $\sqrt{\alpha} - \sqrt{\beta} > \sqrt{1}$, as

began in the parent molecular cloud core and continued through the collapse of
that core to form the protosun and the solar nebula, and finally during the
evolution of the solar nebula itself as the cometary bodies were accreting.
Disentangling the effects of the various epochs on the final composition of a
comet is complicated. But comets are not the only source of information about
the solar nebula. Protostellar disks around young stars similar to the protosun
provide a way of investigating the evolution of disks similar to the solar
nebula while they are in the process of evolving to form their own solar
systems. In this way we can learn about the physical and chemical conditions
under which comets formed, and about the types of dynamical processing that
shaped the solar system we see today.

that the family GRDH is an $\varepsilon$-almost-$\Delta$-universal family of
hash functions for some $\varepsilon<1$ if and only if $n$ is odd and
$\gcd(x_i,n)=t_i=1$ $(1\leq i\leq k)$. Furthermore, if these conditions are
satisfied then GRDH is $\frac{1}{p-1}$-almost-$\Delta$-universal, where $p$ is
the smallest prime divisor of $n$. Finally, as an application of our results,

rely on observations of the co-eval populations of stars in open clusters. We
used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to study M37, a 500-Myr-old open cluster
that has been extensively surveyed for rotation periods ($P_{\rm rot}$). M37
was observed almost continuously for five days, for a total of 440.5 ksec, to
measure stellar X-ray luminosities ($L_{\mathrm{X}}$), a proxy for coronal
activity, across a wide range of masses. The cluster's membership catalog was
revisited to calculate updated membership probabilities from photometric data
and each star's distance to the cluster center. The result is a comprehensive
sample of 1699 M37 members: 426 with $P_{\rm rot}$, 278 with X-ray detections,
and 76 with both. We calculate Rossby numbers, $R_o = P_{\rm rot}/\tau$, where
$\tau$ is the convective turnover time, and ratios of the X-ray-to-bolometric
luminosity, $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}$, to minimize mass dependencies in our
characterization of the rotation-coronal activity relation at 500 Myr. We find
that fast rotators, for which $R_o<0.09\pm0.01$, show saturated levels of
activity, with log($L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}$)$=-3.06\pm0.04$. For
$R_o\geq0.09\pm0.01$, activity is unsaturated and follows a power law of the
form $R_o^\beta$, where $\beta$=$-2.03_{-0.14}^{+0.17}$. This is the largest
sample available for analyzing the dependence of coronal emission on rotation
for a single-aged population, covering stellar masses in the range 0.4$-$1.3
$M_{\odot}$, $P_{\rm rot}$ in the range 0.4$-$12.8 d, and $L_{\rm X}$ in the
range 10$^{28.4-30.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Our results make M37 a new benchmark open
cluster for calibrating the ARAR at ages of $\approx$500 Myr.

complexity to the ""electric double layer"" (EDL). We apply Density Functional
Theory (DFT) to investigate how the applied voltage is manifested as changes in
the EDL at atomic lengthscales, including charge separation and interfacial
dipole moments. Illustrating examples include Li(3)PO(4), Li(2)CO(3), and
Li(x)Mn(2)O(4) thin-films on Au(111) surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum
conditions. Adsorbed organic solvent molecules can strongly reduce voltages
predicted in vacuum. We propose that manipulating surface dipoles, seldom
discussed in battery studies, may be a viable strategy to improve electrode
passivation. We also distinguish the computed potential governing electrons,
which is the actual or instantaneous voltage, and the ""lithium cohesive energy""
based voltage governing Li content widely reported in DFT calculations, which
is a slower-responding self-consistency criterion at interfaces. This
distinction is critical for a comprehensive description of electrochemical

groups of unitary operators in a smooth orthonormal basis of the L2 space of
the dynamical system, acquired from time-ordered data through the diffusion
maps algorithm. Using this representation, we compute Koopman eigenfunctions
through a regularized advection-diffusion operator, and employ these
eigenfunctions in dimension reduction maps with projectible dynamics and high
smoothness for the given observation modality. In systems with pure point
spectra, we construct a decomposition of the generator of the Koopman group
into mutually commuting vector fields that transform naturally under changes of
observation modality, which we reconstruct in data space through a
representation of the pushforward map in the Koopman eigenfunction basis. We
also establish a correspondence between Koopman operators and Laplace-Beltrami
operators constructed from data in Takens delay-coordinate space, and use this
correspondence to provide an interpretation of diffusion-mapped delay
coordinates for this class of systems. Moreover, we take advantage of a special
property of the Koopman eigenfunction basis, namely that the basis elements
evolve as simple harmonic oscillators, to build nonparametric forecast models
for probability densities and observables. In systems with more complex
spectral behavior, including mixing systems, we develop a method inspired from
time change in dynamical systems to transform the generator to a new operator
with potentially improved spectral properties, and use that operator for vector
field decomposition and nonparametric forecasting.

connections to source coding with side information. The setting is then
generalized to include a shared secret key between the transmitter and the
legitimate receiver and a rate constraint on the transmitter, which corresponds
to the Shannon cipher system. A single-letter characterization of the highest
achievable exponent is provided, and asymptotically-optimal strategies for both
the primary user and the eavesdropper are demonstrated.

The method is rather general and can be applied for any quantity computed in a

influence maximization in social networks: One seeks to select among certain
accessible nodes in a network, and then select, adaptively, among neighbors of
those nodes as they become accessible in order to maximize a global objective
function. More generally, adaptive seeding is a stochastic optimization
framework where the choices in the first stage affect the realizations in the
second stage, over which we aim to optimize.
  Our main result is a $(1-1/e)^2$-approximation for the adaptive seeding
problem for any monotone submodular function. While adaptive policies are often
approximated via non-adaptive policies, our algorithm is based on a novel
method we call \emph{locally-adaptive} policies. These policies combine a
non-adaptive global structure, with local adaptive optimizations. This method
enables the $(1-1/e)^2$-approximation for general monotone submodular functions
and circumvents some of the impossibilities associated with non-adaptive
policies.
  We also introduce a fundamental problem in submodular optimization that may
be of independent interest: given a ground set of elements where every element
appears with some small probability, find a set of expected size at most $k$
that has the highest expected value over the realization of the elements. We
show a surprising result: there are classes of monotone submodular functions
(including coverage) that can be approximated almost optimally as the
probability vanishes. For general monotone submodular functions we show via a
reduction from \textsc{Planted-Clique} that approximations for this problem are
not likely to be obtainable. This optimization problem is an important tool for
adaptive seeding via non-adaptive policies, and its hardness motivates the
introduction of \emph{locally-adaptive} policies we use in the main result.

fundamental notion originally considered by Schr{\""o}dinger, has also recently
received much attention. When Alice and Bob share a correlated quantum system,
Alice can perform a local measurement to `steer' Bob's reduced state. We
introduce the maximal steered coherence as a measure describing the extent to
which steering can remotely create coherence; more precisely, we find the
maximal coherence of Bob's steered state in the eigenbasis of his original
reduced state, where maximization is performed over all positive-operator
valued measurements for Alice. We prove that maximal steered coherence vanishes
for quantum-classical states whilst reaching a maximum for pure entangled
states with full Schmidt rank. Although invariant under local unitary
operations, maximal steered coherence may be increased when Bob performs a
channel. For a two-qubit state we find that Bob's channel can increase maximal
steered coherence if and only if it is neither unital nor semi-classical, which
coincides with the condition for increasing discord. Our results show that the
power of steering for coherence generation, though related to discord, is
distinct from existing measures of quantum correlation.

matchings. We give a conjecture on the minimum $d$-degree threshold forcing a
(near) perfect matching in $H$ which generalizes a well-known conjecture on
perfect matchings. We also verify our conjecture in various cases. Our proof
makes use of the lattice-based absorbing method that the author used recently
to solve two other problems on matching and tilings for hypergraphs.

challenges are often associated with contextual and representational features

particularly poor and some research suggests that this may be primarily due to
misapplied right-hand rules. However, few studies have had the resolution to
explore student use of right-hand rules in detail. This study reviews
literature in several disciplines, including spatial cognition, to identify ten
contextual and representational problem features that are most likely to
influence performance on problems requiring a right-hand rule. Two quantitative
measures of performance (correctness and response time) and two qualitative
measures (methods used and type of errors made) were used to explore the impact
of these problem features on student performance. Quantitative results are
consistent with expectations from the literature, but reveal that some features
(such as the type of reasoning required and the physical awkwardness of using a
right-hand rule) have a greater impact than others (such as whether the vectors
are placed together or separate). Additional insight is gained by the
qualitative analysis, including identifying sources of difficulty not
previously discussed in the literature and revealing that the use of
supplemental methods, such as physically rotating the paper, can mitigate
errors associated with certain features.

other hand, electrowetting hysteresis on rough surfaces can be relatively large

the present report we demonstrate that using a thin layer of dielectric

invariant that we discover. It leads to a new canonical tractor connection for
these geometries which is defined on a rank $(n+1)$-bundle. We show this

to a new class of invariant linear differential operators that are canonically

  We apply the results to study the metrisability equation, in the nullity

of an edge-weighted tree T, and have to be served eventually. A service is
defined as a subtree X of T that contains its root. This subtree X serves all
requests that are pending in the nodes of X, and the cost of this service is
equal to the total weight of X. Each request also incurs waiting cost between
its arrival and service times. The objective is to minimize the total waiting
cost of all requests plus the total cost of all service subtrees. MLAP is a
generalization of some well-studied optimization problems; for example, for
trees of depth 1, MLAP is equivalent to the TCP Acknowledgment Problem, while
for trees of depth 2, it is equivalent to the Joint Replenishment Problem.
Aggregation problem for trees of arbitrary depth arise in multicasting, sensor

facilitated diffusion mechanism to locate their target sequences on DNA in
living bacteria cells: TFs alternate between sliding motion along DNA and
relocation events through the cytoplasm. From simulations and theoretical
analysis we study the TF-sliding motion for a large section of the DNA-sequence
of a common E. coli strain, based on the two-state TF-model with a fast-sliding
search state and a recognition state enabling target detection. For the
probability to detect the target before dissociating from DNA the TF-search
times self-consistently depend heavily on whether or not an auxiliary operator
(an accessible sequence similar to the main operator) is present in the genome
section. Importantly, within our model the extent to which the interconversion
rates between search and recognition states depend on the underlying nucleotide
sequence is varied. A moderate dependence maximises the capability to
distinguish between the main operator and similar sequences. Moreover, these
auxiliary operators serve as starting points for DNA looping with the main
operator, yielding a spectrum of target detection times spanning several orders
of magnitude. Auxiliary operators are shown to act as funnels facilitating
target detection by TFs.

Treewidth and branchwidth have alternative definitions through intersections of

show that mm-width combines both aspects, focusing on nodes and on edges. Based
on this we prove that given a graph $G$ and a branch decomposition of mm-width
$k$ we can solve Dominating Set in time $O^*({8^k})$, thereby beating
$O^*(3^{\operatorname{tw}(G)})$ whenever $\operatorname{tw}(G) > \log_3{8}

Riemannian manifold, we further propose a joint learning method of low-rank

alleviate the side effect of background clutter on our CLM, we also present a

report here the discovery of an intermediate system OGLE-2013-BLG-0723LB/Bb

either as a scaled down version of a planet plus star or as a scaled up version
of a moon plus planet orbiting a star. The latter analogy can be further
extended since they orbit in the potential of a larger, stellar body. For
ice-rock companions formed in the outer parts of accretion disks, like Uranus

are similar, leading us to suggest that formation processes of companions
within accretion disks around stars, brown dwarfs, and planets are similar.

CFHTLS covering 8.2 deg$^{2}$ sample scales larger than 100 $h^{-1}$Mpc at

$M_{*}$, and star formation through halo modeling. Based on halo occupation
distributions (HODs) of $M_{*}$ threshold samples, we derive HODs for $M_{*}$
binned galaxies, and then calculate the $M_{*}/M_{\rm halo}$ ratio. The ratio
for central galaxies shows a peak at $M_{\rm halo}\sim10^{12}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$,
and satellites predominantly contribute to the total stellar mass in cluster
environments with $M_{*}/M_{\rm halo}$ values of 0.01--0.02. Using star-forming
galaxies split by sSFR, we find that main sequence galaxies ($\rm
log\,sSFR/yr^{-1}\sim-9$) are mainly central galaxies in $\sim10^{12.5}
h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ haloes with the lowest clustering amplitude, while lower sSFR
galaxies consist of a mixture of both central and satellite galaxies where
those with the lowest $M_{*}$ are predominantly satellites influenced by their
environment. Considering the lowest $M_{\rm halo}$ samples in each $M_{*}$ bin,
massive central galaxies reside in more massive haloes with lower sSFRs than
low mass ones, indicating star-forming central galaxies evolve from a low
$M_{*}$--high sSFR to a high $M_{*}$--low sSFR regime. We also find that the
most rapidly star-forming galaxies ($\rm log\,sSFR/yr^{-1}>-8.5$) are in more
massive haloes than main sequence ones, possibly implying galaxy mergers in
dense environments are driving the active star formation. These results support
the conclusion that the majority of star-forming galaxies follow secular
evolution through the sustained but decreasing formation of stars.

to approximate the trimmed $L$-statistic by a non-trimmed $L$-statistic (with

the Galaxy (halo, thick disk, thin disk) from a data sample obtained in a
recent investigation (Ram{\'\i}rez et al. 2013). These correlations support
previous results inferred from poorer samples: stars display a ""main sequence""
expressed as [Fe/H] = $a$[O/H$]+b\mp\Delta b$ where a unit slope, $a=1$,

distributions are then determined for different subsamples, which are well
explained by the theoretical predictions of multistage closed-(box+reservoir)
(MCBR) chemical evolution models by taking into account the found correlations.
The interpretation of these distributions in the framework of MCBR models gives
us clues about inflow/outflow rates in these different Galactic regions and
their corresponding evolution. Outflow rate for the thick and the thin disks
are lower than the halo outflow rate. Moreover if the thin disk built up from
the thick disk, both systems result of comparable masses. Besides that, the
iron-to-oxygen yield ratio and the primary to not primary contribution ratio
for the iron production are obtained from the data, resulting consistent with
SNII progenitor nucleosynthesis and with the iron production from SNIa

properties. For iron-based superconductors (Fe-SC), the correct definition of
their phase diagrams is crucial because of the close interplay between their
crystallo-chemical and magnetic properties, on one side, and the possible
coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity, on the other. The two most
difficult issues for understanding the Fe-SC phase diagrams are: 1) the origin
of the structural transformation taking place during cooling and its
relationship with magnetism; 2) the correct description of the region where a
crossover between the magnetic and superconducting electronic ground states
takes place. Hence a proper and accurate definition of the structural, magnetic
and electronic phase boundaries provides an extremely powerful tool for
material scientists. For this reason, an exact definition of the thermodynamic
phase fields characterizing the different structural and physical properties
involved is needed, although it is not easy to obtain in many cases. Moreover,
physical properties can often be strongly dependent on the occurrence of
micro-structural and other local-scale features (lattice micro-strain, chemical
fluctuations, domain walls, grain boundaries, defects), which, as a rule, are
not described in a structural phase diagram. In this review, we critically
summarize the results for the most studied 11-, 122- and 1111-type compound
systems, providing a correlation between experimental evidence and theory.

polar CSS081231:071126+440405 from the infrared to the X-ray regime.
  Methods: We obtained phase-resolved XMM-Newton X-ray observations on two
occasions in 2012 and 2013 in different states of accretion. In 2013 the
XMM-Newton X-ray and UV data were complemented by optical photometric and
spectroscopic observations.
  Results: CSS081231 displays two-pole accretion in the high state. The
magnetic fields of the two poles are 36 and 69 MG, indicating a non-dipolar
field geometry. The X-ray spectrum of the main accreting pole with the lower
field comprises a hot thermal component from the cooling accretion plasma,
$kT_{plas}$ of a few tens of keV, and a much less luminous blackbody-like
component from the accretion area with $kT_{\rm bb} \sim$ 50-100\,eV. The
high-field pole which was located opposite to the mass-donating star accretes
at a low rate and has a plasma temperature of about 4\,keV. At both occasions
the X-ray eclipse midpoint precedes the optical eclipse midpoint by 3.2
seconds. The center of the X-ray bright phase shows accretion-rate dependent
longitudinal motion of ~20 degrees.
  Conclusions: CSS081231 is a bright polar that escaped detection in the RASS
survey because it was in a low accretion state. Even in the high state it lacks
the prominent soft component previously thought ubiquitous in polars. Such an
excess may still be present in the unobserved extreme ultraviolet. All polars
discovered in the XMM-Newton era lack the prominent soft component. The
intrinsic spectral energy distribution of polars still awaits characterisation
by future X-ray surveys such as eROSITA. The trajectory taken by material to
reach the second pole is still uncertain.

doubly charged singlet scalar $k^{\pm\pm}$ without couplings to the charged
leptons, while two other singly charged scalars $h_1^\pm$ and $h_2^\pm$ attach
to them. In this setup, the lepton flavor violation originating from
$k^{\pm\pm}$ exchanges is suppressed and the model is less constrained, where
some couplings can take sizable values. As reported in our previous work, the
loop suppression factor at the three loop level would be too strong and
realized neutrino masses in a three loop scenario could be smaller than the
observed minuscule values. The sizable couplings can help us to enhance
neutrino masses without drastically large scalar trilinear couplings appearing
in a neutrino mass matrix, which tends to drive the vacuum stability to become
jeopardized at the one loop level. Now the doubly charged scalar $k^{\pm\pm}$
has less constraint via lepton flavor violation and the vacuum can be quite
stable, and thus a few hundred GeV mass in $k^{\pm\pm}$ is possible, which is
within the LHC reach and this model can be tested in the near future. Note that
the other $h_1^\pm$ and $h_2^\pm$ should be heavy at least around a few TeV. We
suitably arrange the charges of an additional global $U(1)$ symmetry, where the
decay constant of the associated Nambu-Goldstone boson can be around a TeV
scale consistently. Also, this model is indirectly limited through a global
analysis on results of the LHC Higgs search and issues on a dark matter
candidate, the lightest Majorana neutrino. After $h_1^\pm$ and $h_2^\pm$ are
decoupled, this particle couples to the standard model particles only through
two charge parity even scalars in theory and thus information on this scalar
sector is important. Consistent solutions are found, but a part of them is now
on the edge.

are equipped with a travel cost, plus a set of objects, each associated with a
transportation request given by a pair of origin and destination nodes. A
vehicle travels through the graph, carrying each object from its origin to its
destination without any bound on the number of objects that can be
simultaneously transported. The vehicle starts and terminates its ride at given
nodes, and the goal is to compute a minimum-cost ride satisfying all requests.
This ride sharing problem is shown to be tractable on paths by designing a $O(h
\log h+n)$ algorithm, with $h$ being the number of distinct requests and with
$n$ being the number of nodes in the path. The algorithm is then used as a
subroutine to efficiently solve instances defined over cycles, hence covering

of mass $M$ in thermal equilibrium with a plasma consisting of photons,
electrons, and positrons confined inside a cavity . The final result is
astonishingly simple: charge fluctuations have two independent contributions:
one that comes from the black hole itself, with no respect to the plasma, and
another one that arises from the plasma; both are Universal, do not depend on
the black hole mass and none of them depends on the charge of the charge
carriers. They differ by a numerical factor of order one if we assume the
cut-off parameter to be Planckian. Therefore, we regard them as physically
identical. Interestingly enough, the black hole's charge (squared) fluctuations
are of the order $\hbar$ which is not too far from the fine structure constant.
The physical origin of charge fluctuations remains raises a puzzle. Since it
does not depend upon the charge of the charge carriers, it cannot be regarded
as resulting from the trade of charges between the black hole and the quantum
fields and is truly of quantum gravity nature (albeit in a semi-classical
approximation). There are at least two possible ways of interpreting our
results: either charge is trapped inside the black hole and the average must be
regarded over an ensemble of black-holes or eventuality charge fluctuations
arise from particles crossing the Cauchy horizon $\overline{r_-} \sim \hbar/2M$
in both directions.

follow power law degree distribution. The aim of this paper is to study the
algorithmic complexity of such ""typical"" networks. The contribution of this
work is twofold.
  First, we define a deterministic condition for checking whether a graph has a
power law degree distribution and experimentally validate it on real-world
networks. This definition allows us to derive interesting properties of power
law networks. We observe that for exponents of the degree distribution in the
range $[1,2]$ such networks exhibit double power law phenomenon that was
observed for several real-world networks. Our observation indicates that this
phenomenon could be explained by just pure graph theoretical properties.
  The second aim of our work is to give a novel theoretical explanation why
many algorithms run faster on real-world data than what is predicted by
algorithmic worst-case analysis. We show how to exploit the power law degree
distribution to design faster algorithms for a number of classical P-time
problems including transitive closure, maximum matching, determinant, PageRank
and matrix inverse. Moreover, we deal with the problems of counting triangles
and finding maximum clique. Previously, it has been only shown that these
problems can be solved very efficiently on power law graphs when these graphs
are random, e.g., drawn at random from some distribution. However, it is
unclear how to relate such a theoretical analysis to real-world graphs, which
are fixed. Instead of that, we show that the randomness assumption can be
replaced with a simple condition on the degrees of adjacent vertices, which can
be used to obtain similar results. As a result, in some range of power law
exponents, we are able to solve the maximum clique problem in polynomial time,
although in general power law networks the problem is NP-complete.

depinning measurements for a current sent parallel to the DW and compare its

additional torques arise for currents parallel to the DW. Finally, we find a
varying dependence of the maximum depinning efficiency angle for different DWs

accesses. Hence, fast property reads and writes are crucial for good
performance. Unfortunately, many (often redundant) dynamic checks are implied
in each property access and the semantic complexity of JS makes it difficult to
optimize away these tests through program analysis. We introduce two techniques
to effectively eliminate a large proportion of dynamic checks related to object
property accesses.
  Typed shapes enable code specialization based on object property types
without potentially complex and expensive analyses. Shape propagation allows
the elimination of redundant shape checks in inline caches. These two
techniques combine particularly well with Basic Block Versioning (BBV), but
should be easily adaptable to tracing Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers and method
JITs with type feedback.
  To assess the effectiveness of the techniques presented, we have implemented
them in Higgs, a type-specializing JIT compiler for JS. The techniques are
compared to a baseline using polymorphic Inline Caches (PICs), as well as
commercial JS implementations. Empirical results show that across the 26
benchmarks tested, these techniques eliminate on average 48% of type tests,
reduce code size by 17% and reduce execution time by 25%. On several

is one order of magnitude higher than that of relativistic CRs. These protons
generate the 6.4 keV emission from Sgr B2, which was about 30\% of the flux

incorporating fully time-dependent and self-consistent modeling of bright
gamma-ray flares of PKS1510-089 resolved with Fermi-LAT, in the framework of

the gamma-ray flaring zone outside of the broad-line region, namely around
0.3pc from the core for a free-expanding jet with the opening angle Gamma,
\theta_\mathrm{jet} \simeq 1 (where Gamma is the jet bulk Lorentz factor), up
to \simeq 3pc for a collimated outflow with Gamma, \theta_\mathrm{jet} \simeq
0.1. Moreover, under the Gamma, \theta_\mathrm{jet} \simeq 1 condition, our
modeling indicates the maximum efficiency of the jet production during the
flares, with the total jet energy flux strongly dominated by protons and
exceeding the available accretion power in the source. This is in contrast to
the quiescence states of the blazar, characterized by lower jet kinetic power
and an approximate energy equipartition between different plasma constituents.
We demostrate how strictly simultaneous observations of flaring PKS1510-089 at

extensive simulations as presented in this paper, may help to impose further
precise constraints on the magnetization and opening angle of the emitting

Doppler factor across the jet, caused by the radial expansion of the outflow,
may lead to a pronounced time distortion in the observed gamma-ray light

extended decay phases.

quickly find the promoters of these genes within a large genome. Transcription
Factors (TFs) search for their DNA promoter target by alternating between bulk
diffusion and sliding along the DNA, a mechanism known as facilitated
diffusion. We study a facilitated diffusion framework with switching between
three search modes: a bulk mode and two sliding modes triggered by
conformational changes between two protein conformations. In one conformation
(search mode) the TF interacts unspecifically with the DNA backbone resulting
in fast sliding. In the other conformation (recognition mode) it interacts
specifically and strongly with DNA base pairs leading to slow displacement.
From the bulk, a TF associates with the DNA at a random position that is
correlated with the previous dissociation point, which implicitly is a function
of the DNA structure. The target affinity depends on the conformation. We
derive exact expressions for the mean first passage time (MFPT) to bind to the
promoter and the conditional probability to bind before detaching when arriving
at the promoter site. We systematically explore the parameter space and compare
various search scenarios. We compare our results with experimental data for the
dimeric Lac repressor search in E.Coli bacteria. We find that a coiled DNA
conformation is absolutely necessary for a fast MFPT. With frequent spontaneous
conformational changes, a fast search time is achieved even when a TF becomes
immobilized in the recognition state due to the specific bindings. We find a
MFPT compatible with experimental data in presence of a specific TF-DNA

the unit hyper sphere of a finite dimensional Hilbert space with low
correlation between them, has proven very difficult. Algorithms proposed in the

Gram matrix of these structures. Recently, a method based on convex
optimization that operates directly on the vectors of the frame has been shown
to produce promising results. This paper gives a detailed analysis of the
optimization problem at the heart of this approach and, based on these
insights, proposes a new method that substantially outperforms the initial

with low and high redundancy. We give extensive experimental results that show
the effectiveness of the proposed method and its application to optimized

problem is of importance in Cognitive Radio systems when secondary users (SUs)

sensing at Nyquist rate sampling can be costly or even impractical in case of
very wide bandwidth. We first study the effect of timing offset and derive the
necessary and sufficient conditions for signal recovery in the oracle-assisted
case when the true active sub-carriers are assumed known. Then we propose an
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)-based joint sparse recovery method for
identifying active subcarriers when the timing offset is known. Finally we
extend the problem to the case of unknown timing offset and develop a joint
dictionary learning and sparse approximation algorithm, where in the dictionary
learning phase the timing offset is estimated and in the sparse approximation
phase active subcarriers are identified. The obtained results demonstrate that
active subcarrier identification can be carried out reliably, by using the
developed framework.

fully classify the gradient expansion at third order for neutral fluids in four

potentially arise from the local entropy current analysis, this is the maximal
possible set of neutral third-order transport coefficients. To investigate the
physical implications of these new transport coefficients, we obtain the
third-order corrections to the linear dispersion relations that describe the
propagation of diffusion and sound waves in relativistic fluids. We also
compute the corrections to the scalar (spin-$2$) two-point correlation function

this allows us to apply the theory of $\mathcal{A}$-tracial algebras to random

many large scale and accurate mass formula fits suggest the smooth nuclear mass
dependence $\Delta \sim 6(1)~ A^{-1/3}~{\rm MeV}$ in the liquid drop model
which lacks a theoretical motivation. Within the BCS theory we analyze the
impact of phase equivalent interactions on the pairing gap for a translational
invariant many-fermion system such as nuclear and neutron matter. To that end
we use explicitly the Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) transformations.
We show that in the on-shell and continuum limits the pairing gap vanishes. For
finite size systems the pairing gap can be computed directly from the
scattering phase-shifts by the formula $$ \Delta_{nn} (p_F) = \Delta \epsilon_F
~ \delta^{^1S_0}_{nn}(p_F) /\pi ~ , $$ where $p_F$ is the Fermi momentum and
$\Delta \epsilon_F$ the level spacing at the Fermi energy which for the
harmonic oscillator shell model becomes $\Delta \epsilon_F= \hbar \omega \sim
41 ~ A^{-1/3}~{\rm MeV}$, so that $$ \Delta_{nn} (p_F) \sim 4 ~ A^{-1/3}~{\rm

stable nuclei is satisfactory and the discrepancy with the large scale analysis
may be attributed to the lack of three-body forces. Nevertheless, the on-shell
two-body interaction provides a basis for the $c~A^{-1/3}$ dependency and
accounts for 75\% of the coefficient $c$.

stochastically towards stationarity due to unitarity of the microscopic model.
The model implies that in democratic systems, stabilization of one subsystem is
equivalent to global scrambling. We use these results to study scrambling of

computational problem which provides a common framework for many theoretical
and practical applications. A central line of research is concerned with the
identification of classes of instances for which CSP can be solved in
polynomial time; such classes are often called ""islands of tractability."" A
prominent way of defining islands of tractability for CSP is to restrict the
relations that may occur in the constraints to a fixed set, called a constraint
language, whereas a constraint language is conservative if it contains all
unary relations. This paper addresses the general limit of the mentioned
tractability results for CSP and #CSP, that they only apply to instances where
all constraints belong to a single tractable language (in general, the union of
two tractable languages isn't tractable). We show that we can overcome this
limitation as long as we keep some control of how constraints over the various
considered tractable languages interact with each other. For this purpose we
utilize the notion of a \emph{strong backdoor} of a CSP instance, as introduced
by Williams et al. (IJCAI 2003), which is a set of variables that when
instantiated moves the instance to an island of tractability, i.e., to a
tractable class of instances. In this paper, we consider strong backdoors into
\emph{scattered classes}, consisting of CSP instances where each connected
component belongs entirely to some class from a list of tractable classes. Our
main result is an algorithm that, given a CSP instance with $n$ variables,
finds in time $f(k)n^{O(1)}$ a strong backdoor into a scattered class
(associated with a list of finite conservative constraint languages) of size
$k$ or correctly decides that there isn't such a backdoor.

nonparametric regression when the signal is discontinuous (change-point

$m$-dependent process. These estimators circumvent the explicit pre-estimation
of the unknown regression function, a task which is particularly challenging
for such signals. We provide explicit expressions for their mean squared errors
when the signal function is piecewise constant (segment regression) and the
errors are Gaussian. Based on this we derive biased-optimized estimates which
do not depend on the particular (unknown) autocovariance structure. Notably,
for positively correlated errors, that part of the variance of our estimators
which depends on the signal is minimal as well. Further, we provide sufficient
conditions for $\sqrt{n}$-consistency; this result is extended to piecewise
Holder regression with non-Gaussian errors.
  We combine our biased-optimized autocovariance estimates with a
projection-based approach and derive covariance matrix estimates, a method
which is of independent interest. Several simulation studies as well as an
application to biophysical measurements complement this paper.

active galactic nuclei (AGN) and pulsars is constructed. The particle energies
may be boosted up to enormous energies in a several step mechanism. In the
first stage, the Langmuir waves are centrifugally excited and amplified by
means of a parametric process that efficiently pumps rotational energy to
excite electrostatic fields. By considering the pulsars it is shown that the
Langmuir waves very soon Landau damp on the relativistic electrons already
present in a magnetosphere. It has been found that the process is so efficient
that no energy losses might affect the mechanism of particle acceleration.
Applying typical parameters for young pulsars we have shown that by means of
this process the electrons might achieve energies of the order of $10^{18}$ eV.
The situation in AGN magnetospheres is slightly different. In the second stage,
the process of ""Langmuir collapse"" develops, creating appropriate conditions
for transferring electric energy to boost up already high proton energies to
much higher values. As in the previous case, one can show that various energy
losses are relatively weak, and do not impose any significant constraints on
maximum achievable proton energies of the order of $10^{21}$ eV.

of secondary as M5III $\pm$ (two sub-classes). The maximum magnitude versus
rate of decline (MMRD) relations give an unacceptably large value of 37.5 kpc
for the distance. The spectra are typical of the He/N class of novae with
strong HeI and H lines. The profiles are broad and flat topped with full width
at zero intensities (FWZIs) approaching 9000-10000 km s$^{-1}$ and also have a
sharp narrow component superposed which is attributable to emission from the
giant's wind. Hot shocked gas, accompanied by X-rays and $\gamma$ rays, is
expected to form when the high velocity ejecta from the nova plows into the
surrounding giant wind. Although X-ray emission was observed no $\gamma$-ray
emission was reported. It is also puzzling that no signature of a decelerating
shock is seen in the near-infrared (NIR), seen in similar systems like RS Oph,
V745 Sco and V407 Cyg, as rapid narrowing of the line profiles. The small
outburst amplitude and the giant secondary strongly suggest that Nova Sco 2014

the interband Coulomb interaction and the electron-phonon interaction will
cooperatively stabilize a charge density wave (CDW) state which typifies an
""excitonic"" CDW if predominantly triggered by the effective interorbital
electron-hole attraction or a ""phononic"" CDW if mostly caused by the coupling
to the lattice degrees of freedom. By contrast, the Hund's rule coupling
promotes an excitonic spin density wave. We determine the transition between
excitonic charge and spin density waves and comment on a fixation of the phase
of the excitonic order parameter that would prevent the formation of a
superfluid condensate of excitons. The implications for exciton condensation in
several material classes with strongly correlated electrons are discussed.

corrupted by Poisson noise. Prior knowledge about the problem is embedded in a
hierarchical model that describes the dependence structure between the model
parameters and their constraints. In particular, a gamma Markov random field

second MRF is used to model the distribution of the target depth, which are
both expected to exhibit significant spatial correlations. An adaptive Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithm is then proposed to compute the Bayesian estimates

developed in nuclear structure. It is based on the assumption that the energy
of the ground state is a functional only of the density profile. The method is
extremely successful within the effective force approach, noticeably the Skyrme
or Gogny forces, in reproducing the nuclear binding energies and other bulk
properties along the whole mass table. Although the Density Functional is in
this case represented formally as the Hartree-Fock mean field of an effective
force, the corresponding single-particle states in general do not reproduce the
phenomenology particularly well. To overcome this difficulty, a strategy has
been developed where the effective force is adjusted to reproduce directly the
single particle energies, trying to keep the ground state energy sufficiently
well reproduced. An alternative route, that has been developed along several
years, for solving this problem is to introduce the mean field fluctuations, as
represented by the collective vibrations of the nuclear system, and their
influence on the single particle dynamics and structure. This is the basis of
the particle-vibration coupling model. In this paper we present a formal theory
of the particle-vibration coupling model based on the Green' s function method.
The theory extends to realistic effective forces the macroscopic
particle-vibration coupling models and the (microscopic) Nuclear Field Theory.
It is formalized within the functional derivative approach to many-body theory.
An expansion in diagrams is devised for the single particle self-energy and the
phonon propagator. Critical aspects of the particle-vibration coupling model
are analysed in general. Applications at the lowest order of the expansion are
presented and discussed.

observational Hubble parameter data (OHD) in the redshift range $0 \leqslant z
\leqslant 2.36$ to make a cosmological model-independent test of the two-point
$Omh^2(z_{2};z_{1})$ diagnostic. In $\Lambda$CDM, we have $Omh^2 \equiv
\Omega_{m}h^2$, where $\Omega_{m}$ is the matter density parameter at present.
We bin all the OHD into four data points to mitigate the observational
contaminations. By comparing with the value of $\Omega_{m}h^2$ which is
constrained tightly by the Planck observations, our results show that in all
six testing pairs of $Omh^2$ there are two testing pairs are consistent with
$\Lambda$CDM at $1\sigma$ confidence level (CL), whereas for another two of
them $\Lambda$CDM can only be accommodated at $2\sigma$ CL. Particularly, for
remaining two pairs, $\Lambda$CDM is not compatible even at $2\sigma$ CL.
Therefore it is reasonable that although deviations from $\Lambda$CDM exist for
some pairs, cautiously, we cannot rule out the validity of $\Lambda$CDM. We
further apply two methods to derive the value of Hubble constant $H_0$
utilizing the two-point $Omh^2(z_{2};z_{1})$ diagnostic. We obtain $H_0 =
71.23\pm1.54$ ${\mathrm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}}$ from inverse variance
weighted $Omh^2$ value (method (I)) and $H_0 = 69.37\pm1.59$ ${\mathrm{km \
s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}}$ that the $Omh^2$ value originates from Planck measurement
(method (II)), both at $1\sigma$ CL. Finally, we explore how the error in OHD
propagate into $w(z)$ at certain redshift during the reconstruction of $w(z)$.
We argue that the current precision on OHD is not sufficient small to ensure
the reconstruction of $w(z)$ in an acceptable error range, especially at the
low redshift

synthesize them automatically from formal specifications. Oftentimes, a system
can only satisfy its guarantees if certain environment assumptions hold, which
motivates their inclusion in the system specification. Experience with modern
synthesis approaches shows that synthesized systems tend to satisfy their
specifications by actively working towards the violation of the assumptions
rather than satisfying assumptions and guarantees together. Such uncooperative
behavior is undesirable because it violates the aim of synthesis: the system
should try to satisfy its guarantees and use the assumptions only when needed.
Also, the assumptions often describe the valid behavior of other components in
a bigger system, which should not be obstructed unnecessarily.
  In this paper, we present a hierarchy of cooperation levels between system
and environment. Each level describes how well the system enforces both the
assumptions and guarantees. We show how to synthesize systems that achieve the
highest possible cooperation level for a given specification in Linear Temporal
Logic (LTL). The synthesized systems can also exploit cooperative environment
behavior during operation to reach a higher cooperation level that is not
enforceable by the system initially. The worst-case time complexity of our
synthesis procedure is doubly-exponential, which matches the complexity of
standard LTL synthesis.

elongation with respect to the hard sphere reference case and very localized
orientational correlations, typically just involving next-neighbor couplings.
These relatively weak correlations are also reflected in only minor effects on
the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients for most of the
investigated elongations. However, the linear response shear viscosity exhibits
a dramatic increase at high packing fractions ($\phi\gtrsim 0.5$) beyond a
critical anisotropy factor of about $L^* \simeq 0.15$ which is surprising in

the half exponential type and are part of the limiting generalized Pareto
distributions for threshold exceedances. After normalizing marginal tail
distributions in data, a standard Laplace field can be used to capture spatial
dependence among extremes. Asymptotic properties of Laplace fields are explored

joint tail decay rates for Laplace fields are slower than for Gaussian fields
with the same covariance structure; hence they provide more conservative
estimates of very extreme joint risks while maintaining asymptotic
independence. Statistical inference is illustrated on extreme wind gusts in the
Netherlands where a comparison to the Gaussian dependence model shows a better
goodness-of-fit in terms of Akaike's criterion. In this specific application we
fit the well-adapted Weibull distribution as univariate tail model, such that

time evolution of a multi-layered piezoelectric cantilever with tip mass and
moment of inertia, as developed by Kugi and Thull [31]. This closed-loop
control system consists of the inhomogeneous Euler-Bernoulli beam equation
coupled to an ODE system that is designed to track both the position and angle
of the tip mass for a given reference trajectory. This dynamic controller only
employs first order spatial derivatives, in order to make the system
technically realizable with piezoelectric sensors. From the literature it is
known that it is asymptotically stable [31]. But in a refined analysis we first
prove that this system is not exponentially stable.
  In the second part of this paper, we construct a dissipative finite element
method, based on piecewise cubic Hermitian shape functions and a Crank-Nicolson
time discretization. For both the spatial semi-discretization and the full x -
t-discretization we prove that the numerical method is structure preserving,
i.e. it dissipates energy, analogous to the continuous case. Finally, we derive
error bounds for both cases and illustrate the predicted convergence rates in a
simulation example.

for users with sporadic workload. In recent literature, Cloud Broker (CB) has
been introduced for the benefit of such users. A CB rents resources from CSP

challenge of Quantized Billing Cycles as it negotiates with CSP. We design two
algorithms, one fully online and the other partially online, which maximizes

  Why extensions? In science, experimentalists frequently gather spectral data
in cases when the observed data is limited, for example limited by the
precision of instruments; or on account of a variety of other limiting external
factors. Given this fact of life, it is both an art and a science to still
produce solid conclusions from restricted or limited data. In a general sense,
our monograph deals with the mathematics of extending some such given partial
data-sets obtained from experiments. More specifically, we are concerned with
the problems of extending available partial information, obtained, for example,
from sampling. In our case, the limited information is a restriction, and the
extension in turn is the full positive definite function (in a dual variable);
so an extension if available will be an everywhere defined generating function
for the exact probability distribution which reflects the data; if it were
fully available. Such extensions of local information (in the form of positive
definite functions) will in turn furnish us with spectral information. In this
form, the problem becomes an operator extension problem, referring to operators
in a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). In our presentation we
have stressed hands-on-examples. Extensions are almost never unique, and so we
deal with both the question of existence, and if there are extensions, how they
relate back to the initial completion problem.

transcription factors act at nanomolar concentrations, and noise due to random
arrival of these molecules at their binding sites can severely limit the
precision of regulation. Recent work on the optimization of information flow
through regulatory networks indicates that the lower end of the dynamic range
of concentrations is simply inaccessible, overwhelmed by the impact of this
noise. Motivated by the behavior of homeodomain proteins, such as the maternal
morphogen Bicoid in the fruit fly embryo, we suggest a scheme in which
transcription factors also act as indirect translational regulators, binding to
the mRNA of other transcription factors. Intuitively, each mRNA molecule acts
as an independent sensor of the TF concentration, and averaging over these
multiple sensors reduces the noise. We analyze information flow through this
new scheme and identify conditions under which it outperforms direct
transcriptional regulation. Our results suggest that the dual role of

next-to-next-to-leading fixed-order calculation. After integration over $p_T$,
we recover the known next-to-next-to-leading order result for the inclusive
cross section. We present numerical results at the LHC, together with an

dynamics. As such naturally much discussion and criticism has spawned around
it, some of which concerns the existence of oscillations in the movement of
pedestrians. This contribution is investigating under which circumstances,
parameter choices, and model variants oscillations do occur and how this can be
prevented. It is shown that oscillations can be excluded if the model
parameters fulfill certain relations. The fact that with some parameter choices
oscillations occur and with some not is exploited to verify a specific computer
implementation of the model.

stringy fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) producing some recent
experimental observed filling factor values. More precisely, we derive the
corresponding Chern-Simons type models from M-theory compactified on four
complex dimensional hyper-K\""{a}hler manifolds X^4. These manifolds, which are
viewed as target spaces of a particular N=4 sigma model in two dimensions, are
identified with the cotangent bundles over intersecting 2-dimensional toric
varieties V_i^2 according to toric Cartan matrices. Exploring results of string
dualities, the presented FQHE can be obtained from D6-banes wrapping on such
intersecting toric varieties interacting with R-R gauge fields. This string
theory realization provides a geometric interpretation of the filling factors
in terms of toric and Euler characteristic topological data of the compactified
geometry. Concretely, explicit bilayer models are worked out in some details.

(2014) demonstrated that an atmosphere with
1.3-4 bar of CO2 and H2O, in addition to 5-20% H2, could have raised the mean
annual and global surface temperature of early Mars above the freezing point of
water. Such warm temperatures appear necessary to generate the rainfall (or
snowfall) amounts required to carve the ancient martian valleys. Here, we use
our best estimates for early martian outgassing rates, along with a 1-D
photochemical model, to assess the conversion efficiency of CO, CH4, and H2S to
CO2, SO2, and H2. Our outgassing estimates assume that Mars was actively
recycling volatiles between its crust and interior, as Earth does today. H2
production from serpentinization and deposition of banded iron-formations is
also considered. Under these assumptions, maintaining an H2 concentration of
~1-2% by volume is achievable, but reaching 5% H2 requires additional H2
sources or a slowing of the hydrogen escape rate below the diffusion limit. If
the early martian atmosphere was indeed H2-rich, we might be able to see
evidence of this in the rock record. The hypothesis proposed here is consistent
with new data from the Curiosity Rover, which show evidence for a long-lived
lake in Gale Crater near Mt. Sharp. It is also consistent with measured oxygen
fugacities of martian meteorites, which show evidence for progressive mantle
oxidation over time.

complex-valued scalar field. These two equations together are known as the
Einstein-Klein-Gordon system. In the low-field, non-relativistic limit, the
Einstein-Klein-Gordon system reduces to the Poisson-Schr\""odinger system. We
describe the simplest solutions of these systems in spherical symmetry, the
spherically symmetric static states, and some scaling properties they obey. We
also describe some approximate analytic solutions for these states.
  The EKG system underlies a theory of wave dark matter, also known as scalar
field dark matter (SFDM), boson star dark matter, and Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) dark matter. We discuss a possible connection between the theory of wave
dark matter and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, which is a scaling relation
observed to hold for disk galaxies in the universe across many decades in mass.
We show how fixing boundary conditions at the edge of the spherically symmetric
static states implies Tully-Fisher-like relations for the states. We also
catalog other ""scaling conditions"" one can impose on the static states and show
that they do not lead to Tully-Fisher-like relations--barring one exception
which is already known and which has nothing to do with the specifics of wave
dark matter.

can be quite different, reflecting geometry of the tree.
  We discuss a special case of trees, namely the so-called regular trees. They
possess a rich group of symmetries. This allows one to construct an orthogonal
decomposition of the space $L^2(\Gamma)$ which reduces the Dirac. Based upon
this decomposition, a detailed spectral analysis of Dirac operator on the
