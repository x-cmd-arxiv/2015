provide strong support for the local orbital picture and the existence of an

surface terminations, namely FeSe and (Li0.8Fe0.2)OH surfaces. On the FeSe
surface, the superconducting state is fully gapped with double coherence peaks,
and a vortex core state with split peaks near EF is observed. Through
quasi-particle interference (QPI) measurements, we clearly observed intra- and
inter-pocket scatterings in between the electron pockets at the M point, as
well as some evidence of scattering that connects gamma and M points. Upon
applying magnetic field, the QPI intensity of all the scattering channels are
found to behave similarly. Furthermore, we studied impurity effects on the
superconductivity by investigating intentionally introduced impurities and
intrinsic defects. We observed that magnetic impurities such as Cr adatoms can
induce in-gap states and suppress superconductivity. However, nonmagnetic
impurities such as Zn adatoms do not induce visible in-gap states. Meanwhile,
we show that Zn adatoms can induce in-gap states in thick FeSe films, which is

array of 32 InGaAs photodiodes with 50 $\mu$m pitch. The device has previously
been successfully used to measure vertical beam sizes of 10-100 $\mu$m on a
bunch-by-bunch, turn-by-turn basis at $e^\pm$ beam energies of $\sim$2 GeV and
source magnetic fields below 2.8 kG, for which the detector required
calibration for incident x-rays of 1-5 keV. At $E_{\rm b}=4.0$ GeV and $B$=4.5
kG, however, the incident synchrotron radiation spectrum extends to $\sim$20
keV, requiring calibration of detector response in that regime. Such a
calibration is described and then used to analyze data taken with several
different thicknesses of filters in front of the detector. We obtain a relative
precision of better than 4% on beam size measurement from 15-100 $\mu$m over
several different ranges of x-ray energy, including both 1-12 keV and 6-17 keV.
The response of an identical detector, but tilted vertically by 60$^\circ$ in
order to increase magnfication without a longer beamline, is measured and shown
to improve x-ray detection above 4 keV without compromising sensitivity to beam
size. We also investigate operation of a coded aperture using gold masking

STEREO-B reveal high-velocity evanescent clumps [HVECs] expelled from the coma
of the C/2011 L4 [Pan-STARRS] comet. Animated images provide evidence of highly
dynamic ejecta moving near-radially in the anti-sunward direction. The bulk
speed of the clumps at their initial detection in the HI1-B images range from
$200-400$ km s$^{-1}$ followed by an appreciable acceleration up to speeds of
$450-600$ km s$^{-1}$, which are typical of slow to intermediate solar wind
speeds. The clump velocities do not exceed these limiting values and seem to
reach a plateau. The images also show that the clumps do not expand as they
propagate. Order of magnitude calculations show that ionized single atoms or
molecules accelerate too quickly compared to observations, while dust grains
micron sized or larger accelerate too slowly. We find that neutral Na, Li, K,
or Ca atoms with $\beta>50$ could possibly fit the observations. Just as
likely, we find that an interaction with the solar wind and the heliospheric
magnetic field (HMF) can cause the observed clump dynamical evolution,
accelerating them quickly up to solar wind velocities. We thus speculate that
the HVECs are composed of charged particles (dust particles) or neutral atoms
accelerated by radiation pressure at $\beta>50$ values. In addition, the data
suggest that clump ejecta initially move along near-radial, bright structures,
which then separate into HVECs and larger dust grains that steadily bend
backwards relative to the comet's orbital motion due to the effects of solar
radiation and gravity. These structures gradually form new striae in the dust
tail. The near-periodic spacing of the striae may be indicative of outgassing
activity modulation due to the comet nucleus' rotation. It is, however, unclear
whether all striae are formed as a result of this process.

matrices invariant under cyclic symmetry ($Z_3$) with maximal zero texture (6
zero textures). We explore two different approaches to obtain the cyclic
symmetry invariant form of the constituent matrices. In the first one we
consider explicit cyclic symmetry in the neutrino sector of the Lagrangian
which dictates the emerged effective neutrino mass matrix ($m_\nu$) to be
symmetry invariant and hence leads to a degeneracy in masses. We then consider
explicit breaking of the symmetry through a dimensionless parameter
$\epsilon^{\prime}$ to remove the degeneracy. It is seen that the method
doesn't support the current neutrino oscillation global fit data even after
considering the correction from cyclic symmetry invariant charged lepton mass
matrix ($m_l$) unless the breaking parameter is too large. In the second
method, we assume the same forms of the neutrino mass matrices, however,
symmetry is broken in the charged lepton sector. All the structures of the mass
matrices are now dictated by an effective residual symmetry of some larger
symmetry group in the Lagrangian. For illustration, we exemplify a toy model
based on softly broken $A_4$ symmetry group which leads to one of the
combination of $m_l$, $m_D$, $M_{RS}$ and $\mu$ to generate effective $m_\nu$.
All the emerged mass matrices predict a constraint range of the CP violating
phases and atmospheric mixing angle along with an inverted hierarchical
structure of the neutrino masses. Further, significant predictions on
$\beta\beta0\nu$ decay parameter $|m_{11}|$ and the sum of the three light
neutrino masses ($\Sigma_im_i$) are also obtained.

the feasibility of the modeled device. Although we demonstrate that phase time
may not be spin-resolved, our simulation allows us to evaluate the time that
takes an electron to experience a spin-flip process, resulting in an order of

more data is a central problem in machine learning --- a fast rate of
convergence means less data is needed for the same level of performance. The
pursuit of fast rates in online and statistical learning has led to the
discovery of many conditions in learning theory under which fast learning is
possible. We show that most of these conditions are special cases of a single,
unifying condition, that comes in two forms: the central condition for 'proper'
learning algorithms that always output a hypothesis in the given model, and
stochastic mixability for online algorithms that may make predictions outside
of the model. We show that under surprisingly weak assumptions both conditions
are, in a certain sense, equivalent. The central condition has a
re-interpretation in terms of convexity of a set of pseudoprobabilities,
linking it to density estimation under misspecification. For bounded losses, we
show how the central condition enables a direct proof of fast rates and we
prove its equivalence to the Bernstein condition, itself a generalization of
the Tsybakov margin condition, both of which have played a central role in
obtaining fast rates in statistical learning. Yet, while the Bernstein
condition is two-sided, the central condition is one-sided, making it more
suitable to deal with unbounded losses. In its stochastic mixability form, our
condition generalizes both a stochastic exp-concavity condition identified by
Juditsky, Rigollet and Tsybakov and Vovk's notion of mixability. Our unifying
conditions thus provide a substantial step towards a characterization of fast
rates in statistical learning, similar to how classical mixability
characterizes constant regret in the sequential prediction with expert advice
setting.

regime installs, by means of the formalism involving the Fokker-Planck equation
(FPE). With lowering the temperature, the amount of clusters fraction, the
cluster size and magnetic moment along with its diffusion relaxation time
strongly increase, each in its own temperature interval. Below 130 K, FMC
contribute essentially to the total linear magnetic susceptibility. The damping
factor of the order 0.1 proves the importance of precession in thermal
relaxation of the cluster magnetic moment. The FMC are a precursor of
long-range ferromagnetic correlations seen below 100 K with neutron-scattering
techniques. The employed technique supplemented with FPE-based data-treatment
formalism is a novel method for studying superparamagnetic systems.

the interplay of spin density fluctuations and weak disorder for a
two-dimensional metal near an antiferromagnetic (AFM) quantum critical point.
AFM spin density fluctuations carry large momenta around the ordering vector
$\mathbf{Q}$ and, at lowest order of the spin-fermion coupling, only scatter
electrons between ""hot spots"" of the Fermi surface which are connected by
$\mathbf{Q}$. Earlier, it was seen that the quantum interference between AFM
spin density fluctuations and soft diffusive modes of the disordered metal is
suppressed, a consequence of the large-momentum scattering. The suppression of
this interference results in a non-singular temperature dependence of the
corresponding interaction correction to conductivity. However, at higher order
of the spin-fermion coupling, electrons on the entire Fermi surface can be
scattered successively by two spin density fluctuations and, in total, suffer a
small momentum transfer. This higher-order process can be described by
composite modes which carry small momenta. We show that the interference
between formally subleading composite modes and diffusive modes generates
singular interaction corrections which ultimately dominate over the
non-singular first-order correction at low temperatures. We derive an effective
low-energy theory from the spin-fermion model which includes the
above-mentioned higher-order process implicitly and show that for weak
spin-fermion coupling the small-momentum transfer is mediated by a composite
propagator. Employing the conventional diagrammatic approach to impurity
scattering, we find the correction $\delta \sigma \sim +\ln^2 T$ for
temperatures above an exponentially small crossover scale.

  and optimization glasses",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The widespread proliferation of Internet and wireless applications has
produced a significant increase of ICT energy footprint. As a response, in the
last five years, significant efforts have been undertaken to include
energy-awareness into network management. Several green networking frameworks
have been proposed by carefully managing the network routing and the power
state of network devices.
  Even though approaches proposed differ based on network technologies and
sleep modes of nodes and interfaces, they all aim at tailoring the active
network resources to the varying traffic needs in order to minimize energy
consumption. From a modeling point of view, this has several commonalities with
classical network design and routing problems, even if with different
objectives and in a dynamic context.
  With most researchers focused on addressing the complex and crucial
technological aspects of green networking schemes, there has been so far little
attention on understanding the modeling similarities and differences of
proposed solutions. This paper fills the gap surveying the literature with
optimization modeling glasses, following a tutorial approach that guides
through the different components of the models with a unified symbolism. A
detailed classification of the previous work based on the modeling issues
included is also proposed.

progress in the domain of cold atomic gases which are studied in a setting
where atoms that are excited to high-lying Rydberg states interact through
power-law potentials that translate into power-law excitation rates. The
out-of-equilibrium dynamics of this system turns out to be surprisingly rich.
It features a self-similar evolution which leads to a characteristic power-law
time dependence of observables such as the particle concentration, and results
in a scale invariance of the structure factor. Our findings show that in
dissipative Rydberg gases out of equilibrium the characteristic distance among
excitations --- often referred to as the blockade radius --- is not a static

optimization devices, but the usefulness of such devices will be limited in
part by the range of implementable problems as dictated by hardware
constraints. To overcome constraints imposed by restricted connectivity between
qubits, a larger set of interactions can be approximated using minor embedding
techniques whereby several physical qubits are used to represent a single
logical qubit. However, minor embedding introduces new types of errors due to
its approximate nature. We introduce and study quantum annealing correction
schemes designed to improve the performance of quantum annealers in conjunction
with minor embedding, thus leading to a hybrid scheme defined over an encoded
graph. We argue that this scheme can be efficiently decoded using an energy
minimization technique provided the density of errors does not exceed the
per-site percolation threshold of the encoded graph. We test the hybrid scheme
using a D-Wave Two processor on problems for which the encoded graph is a
2-level grid and the Ising model is known to be NP-hard. The problems we
consider are frustrated Ising model problem instances with ""planted"" (a priori
known) solutions. Applied in conjunction with optimized energy penalties and
decoding techniques, we find that this approach enables the quantum annealer to
solve minor embedded instances with significantly higher success probability
than it would without error correction. Our work demonstrates that quantum
annealing correction can and should be used to improve the robustness of
quantum annealing not only for natively embeddable problems, but also when
minor embedding is used to extend the connectivity of physical devices.

the effective temperature and luminosity suggest that the evolutionary state is

phase, considering into account the abundance of [Ar/H]. The Spitzer/IRS
spectrum displays broad 16-24 um and 30 um features, as well as PAH bands at
6-9 um and 10-14 um. The unidentified broad 16-24 um feature may not be related
to iron sulfide (FeS), amorphous silicate, or PAHs. Using the spectral energy
distribution model, we derived the luminosity and effective temperature of the
central star, and the gas and dust masses. The observed elemental abundances
and derived gas mass are in good agreement with asymptotic giant branch
nucleosynthesis models for an initial mass of 1.90 Msun and a metallicity of
Z=0.004. We infer that respectively about 80 %, 50 %, and 90 % of the Mg, S,

the nucleus breaks into fragments. We model the sublimation process
thermodynamically and propose that it is responsible for the disruption of
Comet ISON. We estimate the bulk unconfined crushing strength of Comet ISON's
nucleus and the resulting fragments to be 0.5 Pa and 1-9 Pa respectively,
assuming typical Jupiter Family Comet (JFC) albedos. However, if Comet ISON has
an albedo similar to Pluto, this strength estimate drops to 0.2 Pa for the
intact nucleus and 0.6-4 Pa for its fragments. Regardless of assumed albedo,
these are similar to previous strength estimates of JFCs. This suggests that,
if Comet ISON is representative of dynamically new comets, then low bulk
strength is a primordial property of some comet nuclei, and not due to thermal
processing during migration into the Jupiter Family.

""MT"") to the Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL); the basic operation done in MT and its
variants is a search for ""bad"" events in a current configuration. In the
initial stage of MT, the variables are set independently. We examine the
distributions on these variables which arise during intermediate stages of MT.
We show that these configurations have a more or less ""random"" form, building
further on the ""MT-distribution"" concept of Haeupler et al. in understanding
the (intermediate and) output distribution of MT. This has a variety of
algorithmic applications; the most important is that bad events can be found
relatively quickly, improving upon MT across the complexity spectrum: it makes
some polynomial-time algorithms sub-linear (e.g., for Latin transversals, which
are of basic combinatorial interest), gives lower-degree polynomial run-times
in some settings, transforms certain super-polynomial-time algorithms into
polynomial-time ones, and leads to Las Vegas algorithms for some coloring
problems for which only Monte Carlo algorithms were known.
  We show that in certain conditions when the LLL condition is violated, a
variant of the MT algorithm can still produce a distribution which avoids most
of the bad events. We show in some cases this MT variant can run faster than
the original MT algorithm itself, and develop the first-known criterion for the
case of the asymmetric LLL. This can be used to find partial Latin transversals
-- improving upon earlier bounds of Stein (1975) -- among other applications.
We furthermore give applications in enumeration, showing that most applications
(where we aim for all or most of the bad events to be avoided) have many more
solutions than known before by proving that the MT-distribution has ""large""
min-entropy and hence that its support-size is large.

graphene/hBN heterostructure. We showed previously that this technique allows
for nanosecond spin lifetimes at room temperature combined with carrier
mobilities which exceed 20,000 cm$^2$/(Vs). Despite strongly enhanced spin and
charge transport properties, the MgO injection barriers in these devices
exhibit conducting pinholes which still limit the measured spin lifetimes. We
demonstrate that these pinholes can be partially diminished by an oxygen
treatment of a trilayer graphene device which is seen by a strong increase of
the contact resistance area products of the Co/MgO electrodes. At the same
time, the spin lifetime increases from 1 ns to 2 ns. We believe that the
pinholes partially result from the directional growth in molecular beam
epitaxy. For a second set of devices, we therefore used atomic layer deposition
of Al$_2$O$_3$ which offers the possibility to isotropically deposit more
homogeneous barriers. While the contacts of the as-fabricated bilayer graphene
devices are non-conductive, we can partially break the oxide barriers by
voltage pulses. Thereafter, the devices also exhibit nanosecond spin lifetimes.

($z_{phot}=8.57^{+0.22}_{-0.43}$), apparent brightness (H$_{160}=25.26\pm0.09$)
and red Spitzer/IRAC [3.6]-[4.5] color indicative of contamination by strong
oxygen emission in the [4.5] band. With a total integration of $\sim$4.3 hours,
our data reveal an emission line at $\simeq$11776 {\AA} which we argue is
likely Ly$\alpha$ at a redshift $z_{spec}=8.683^{+0.001}_{-0.004}$, in good
agreement with the photometric estimate. The line was detected independently on
two nights using different slit orientations and its detection significance is
$\sim7.5\sigma$. An overlapping skyline contributes significantly to the
uncertainty on the total line flux although the significance of the detected
line is robust to a variety of skyline-masking procedures. By direct addition
and a Gaussian fit, we estimate a 95\% confidence range of
1.0--2.5$\times10^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to a rest-frame
equivalent width of 17--42 {\AA}. EGSY8p7 is the most distant galaxy confirmed
spectroscopically to date, and the third luminous source in the EGS field
beyond $z_{phot}\gtrsim7.5$ with detectable Ly$\alpha$ emission viewed at a
time when the intergalactic medium is believed to be fairly neutral. Although
the reionization process was probably patchy, we discuss whether luminous
sources with prominent IRAC color excesses may harbor harder ionizing spectra
than the dominant fainter population thereby creating earlier ionized bubbles.
Further spectroscopic follow-up of such bright sources promises important
insight into the early formation of galaxies.

is a new project to study the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). In this first paper,
we probe the connection between observed high-redshift galaxies and simulated
dark matter halos to better understand the abundance and evolution of the
primary source of ionizing radiation. High-resolution N-body simulations are
run to quantify the abundance of dark matter halos as a function of mass $M$,
accretion rate $\dot{M}$, and redshift $z$. A new fit for the halo mass
function $dn/dM$ is $\approx 20\%$ more accurate at the high-mass end where
bright galaxies are expected to reside. A novel approach is used to fit the
halo accretion rate function $dn/d\dot{M}$ in terms of the halo mass function.
Abundance matching against the observed galaxy luminosity function is used to
estimate the luminosity-mass relation and the luminosity-accretion-rate
relation. The inferred star formation efficiency is not monotonic with $M$ nor
$\dot{M}$, but reaches a maximum value at a characteristic mass $\sim 2 \times
10^{11}\ M_\odot$ and a characteristic accretion rate $\sim 6 \times 10^2\

$\phi_\star$ decreases, $M_\star$ is more positive (fainter), and $\alpha$ is
more negative (steeper) at higher redshifts. We forecast for the upcoming James
Webb Space Telescope and show that with apparent magnitude limit $m_{\rm AB}

CO rotational line emitted during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Our approach
is based on large velocity gradient (LVG) modeling, a radiative transfer
modeling technique that generates the full CO spectral line energy distribution
(SLED) for a specified gas kinetic temperature, volume density, velocity
gradient, molecular abundance, and column density. These parameters, which
drive the physics of CO transitions and ultimately dictate the shape and
amplitude of the CO SLED, can be linked to the global properties of the host
galaxy, mainly the star formation rate (SFR) and the SFR surface density. By
further employing an empirically derived SFR-M relation for high redshift
galaxies, we can express the LVG parameters, and thus the specific intensity of
any CO rotational transition, as functions of the host halo mass M and redshift
z. Integrating over the range of halo masses expected to host CO-luminous
galaxies, we predict a mean CO(1-0) brightness temperature ranging from ~0.6
{\mu}K at z= 6 to ~0.03 {\mu} at z= 10 with brightness temperature fluctuations
of $\Delta_{CO}^2$ ~ 0.1 and 0.005 {\mu}K respectively, at k = 0.1 Mpc$^{-1}$.
In this model, the CO emission signal remains strong for higher rotational
levels at z = 6, with <T$_{CO}$>~ 0.3 and 0.05 {\mu}K for the CO J = 6->5 and
CO J = 10->9 transitions respectively. Including the effects of CO
photodissociation in these molecular clouds, especially at low metallicities,
results in the overall reduction in the amplitude of the CO signal, with the
low- and high-J lines weakening by 2-20% and 10-45%, respectively, over the

cosmic variance and to sample bright and rare H$\alpha$ emitters up to an
observed luminosity of $\sim10^{42.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$, equivalent to $\sim11
M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Using our sample of $220$ sources brighter than
$>10^{41.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($>1 M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), we derive H$\alpha$
luminosity functions, which are well described by a Schechter function with
$\phi^* = 10^{-2.85\pm0.03}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ and $L^*_{H\alpha} = 10^{41.71\pm0.02}$
erg s$^{-1}$ (with a fixed faint end slope $\alpha=-1.35$). We find that
surveys probing smaller volumes ($\sim3\times10^4$ Mpc$^3$) are heavily
affected by cosmic variance, which can lead to errors of over $100$ per cent in
the characteristic density and luminosity of the H$\alpha$ luminosity function.
We derive a star formation rate density of $\rho_\mathrm{SFRD} =
0.0094\pm0.0008$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, in agreement with the redshift-dependent
H$\alpha$ parametrisation from Sobral et al. (2013). The two-point correlation
function is described by a single power law $\omega(\theta) = (0.159\pm0.012)
\theta^{(-0.75\pm0.05)}$, corresponding to a clustering length of $r_0 =
3.3\pm0.8$ Mpc/h. We find that the most luminous H$\alpha$ emitters at
$z\sim0.2$ are more strongly clustered than the relatively fainter ones. The
$L^*_{H\alpha}$ H$\alpha$ emitters at $z\sim0.2$ in our sample reside in
$\sim10^{12.5-13.5}$ $M_\odot$ dark matter haloes. This implies that the most
star forming galaxies always reside in relatively massive haloes or group-like
environments and that the typical host halo mass of star-forming galaxies is
independent of redshift if scaled by $L_\mathrm{H\alpha}/L^*_{H\alpha}(z)$, as
proposed by Sobral et al. (2010).

of magnetic fields for normal pulsars. The source is further characterized by a
high pulse fraction and a single-peak profile. Using synthetic temperature
distribution profiles, and fully accounting for the general-relativistic
effects of light deflection and gravitational redshift, we generate synthetic
X-ray spectra and pulse profiles that we fit to the observations. We find that
asymmetric and symmetric surface temperature distributions can reproduce
equally well the observed pulse profiles and spectra of SGR 0418. Nonetheless,
the modelling allows us to place constraints on the system geometry (i.e. the
angles $\psi$ and $\xi$ that the rotation axis makes with the line of sight and
the dipolar axis, respectively), as well as on the spot size and temperature
contrast on the neutron star surface. After performing an analysis iterating
between the pulse profile and spectra, as done in similar previous works, we
further employed, for the first time in this context, a Markov-Chain
Monte-Carlo approach to extract constraints on the model parameters from the
pulse profiles and spectra, simultaneously. We find that, to reproduce the
observed spectrum and flux modulation: (a) the angles must be restricted to
$65\deg < \psi+\xi < 125\deg$ or $235\deg < \psi+\xi <295\deg$; (b) the
temperature contrast between the poles and the equator must be at least a
factor of $\sim6$, and (c) the size of the hottest region ranges between
0.2-0.7 km (including uncertainties on the source distance). Last, we interpret

property of bright flares and that it is associated with a stationary noise
process producing flares not uniformly distributed in time (similar to what is
observed in other quiescent black holes). If so, the variation in flaring
properties would be revealed only now because of the increased monitoring
frequency. Alternatively, this may be the first sign of an excess accretion
activity induced by the close passage of G2. More observations are necessary to

accurate modelling of galaxies with non-elliptical shapes, such as disk
galaxies viewed edge-on or galaxies with X-shaped/peanut bulges. Within this
scheme, the angular parameter which defines quasi-elliptical isophotes is
transformed from the commonly used, but inappropriate, polar co-ordinate to the
`eccentric anomaly'. This provides a superior description of deviations from
ellipticity, better capturing the true isophotal shape. Furthermore, this makes
it possible to accurately recover both the surface brightness profile, using
the correct azimuthally-averaged isophote, and the two-dimensional model of any
galaxy: the hitherto ubiquitous, but artificial, cross-like features in
residual images are completely removed. The formalism has been implemented into
the IRAF tasks $Ellipse$ and $Bmodel$ to create the new tasks `$Isofit$', and
`$Cmodel$'. The new tools are demonstrated here with application to five
galaxies, chosen to be representative case-studies for several areas where this
technique makes it possible to gain new scientific insight. Specifically:
properly quantifying boxy/disky isophotes via the fourth harmonic order in
edge-on galaxies, quantifying X-shaped/peanut bulges, higher-order Fourier
moments for modelling bars in disks, and complex isophote shapes. Higher order
(n > 4) harmonics now become meaningful and may correlate with structural
properties, as boxyness/diskyness is known to do. This work also illustrates
how the accurate construction, and subtraction, of a model from a galaxy image
facilitates the identification and recovery of over-lapping sources such as
globular clusters and the optical counterparts of X-ray sources.

rapidly rotating stars based on a self-consistent field scheme. The solution is
obtained iteratively. Both rapidly rotating barotropic and baroclinic
equilibrium states are calculated self-consistently using this method. Two
types of rotating baroclinic stars are investigated by changing the isentropic
surfaces inside the star. Solution sequences of these are calculated
systematically and critical rotation models beyond which no rotating
equilibrium state exists are also obtained. All of these rotating baroclinic
stars satisfy necessarily the Bjerknes-Rosseland rules. Self-consistent
solutions of baro-clinic stars with shellular-type rotation are successfully
obtained where the isentropic surfaces are oblate and the surface temperature
is hotter at the poles than at the equator if it is assumed that the star is an
ideal gas star. These are the first self-consistent and systematic solutions of
rapidly rotating baroclinic stars with shellular-type rotations. Since they
satisfy the stability criterion due to their rapid rotation, these rotating
baroclinic stars would be dynamically stable. This novel numerical method and
the solutions of the rapidly rotating baroclinic stars will be useful for
investigating stellar evolution with rapid rotations.

days, including spectra and Swift UV-optical photometry beginning 2-4 days
post-explosion. This data set makes SN2013ge one of the best observed normal
Type Ib/c SN at early times---when the light curve is particularly sensitive to
the progenitor configuration and mixing of radioactive elements---and reveals
two distinct light curve components in the UV bands. The first component rises
over 4-5 days and is visible for the first week post-explosion. Spectra of the
first component have blue continua and show a plethora of high velocity
(~15,000 km/s) but narrow (~3500 km/s) features, indicating that the
line-forming region is restricted. The explosion parameters estimated for the
bulk explosion are standard for Type Ib/c SN, and there is evidence for weak He
features at early times. In addition, SN2013ge exploded in a low metallicity
environment and we have obtained some of the deepest radio and X-ray limits for
a Type Ib/c SN to date, which constrain the progenitor mass-loss rate. We are
left with two distinct progenitor scenarios for SN2013ge, depending on our
interpretation of the early emission. If the first component is cooling
envelope emission, then the progenitor of SN2013ge either possessed a low-mass
extended envelope or ejected a portion of its envelope in the final <1 year
before core-collapse. Alternatively, if the first component is due to outwardly
mixed Ni-56, then our observations are consistent with the asymmetric ejection
of a distinct clump of nickel-rich material at high velocities. Current models
for the collision of a SN shock with a binary companion cannot reproduce both
the timescale and luminosity of the early emission in SN2013ge. Finally, the
spectra of the first component of SN2013ge are similar to those of the
rapidly-declining SN2002bj.

(L_acc and L_line) of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars have been published for
many different spectral lines, which are used to estimate accretion rates.
Despite the origin of those correlations is unknown, this could be attributed
to direct or indirect physical relations between the emission line formation
and the accretion mechanism. This work shows that all (near-UV/optical/near-IR)
L_acc-L_line correlations are the result of the fact that the accretion
luminosity and the stellar luminosity (L_star) are correlated, and are not
necessarily related with the physical origin of the line. Synthetic and
observational data are used to illustrate how the L_acc-L_line correlations
depend on the L_acc-L_star relationship. We conclude that because PMS stars
show the L_acc-L_star correlation immediately implies that L_acc also
correlates with the luminosity of all emission lines, for which the
L_acc-L_line correlations alone do not prove any physical connection with
accretion but can only be used with practical purposes to roughly estimate
accretion rates. When looking for correlations with possible physical meaning,
we suggest that L_acc/L_star and L_line/L_star should be used instead of L_acc
and L_line. Finally, the finding that L_acc has a steeper dependence on L_star
for T-Tauri stars than for intermediate-mass Herbig Ae/Be stars is also
discussed. That is explained from the magnetospheric accretion scenario and the
different photospheric properties in the near-UV.

of values of $p$ for which the maximal regularity is attained, and construct
concrete examples for each case. Regarding sets with positive measure, for
which the maximal regularity is non-negative, we present new lower bounds on
the maximal Sobolev regularity supported by certain fat Cantor sets, which we
obtain both by capacity-theoretic arguments, and by direct estimation of the
Sobolev norms of characteristic functions. We collect several results
characterising the regularity that can be achieved on certain special classes

investigate the effects of additive, multiplicative and cross correlated
stochastic perturbations on determining regime shifts in a bistable gene
regulatory sys- tem, which gives rise to two distinct states of low and high
concentrations of protein. We obtain the stationary probability density and
mean first passage time of the system. We show that increasing
additive(multiplicative) noise intensity induces regime shift from a low(high)
to a high(low) pro- tein concentration state. However, an increase in cross
correlation intensity always induces regime shifts from high to low protein
concentration state. For both bifurcation (often called tipping point) and
noise induced (called stochastic switching) regime shifts, we further explore
the robustness of recently developed critical slowing down based early warning
signal (EWS) indicators (e.g., rising variance and lag-1 autocorrelation) on
our simulated time series data. We identify that using EWS indicators,
prediction of an impending bifurcation induced regime shift is relatively
easier than that of a noise induced regime shift in the considered system.
Moreover, the success of EWS indicators also strongly depends upon the nature
of noise. Our results establish the key fact that finding more robust indicator
to forewarn regime shifts for a broader class complex natural systems is still
in its infancy and demands extensive research.

proposes a way for a robot to recognize every object at an almost human-level
accuracy. Our key observation is that many robots will stay in a relatively
closed environment (e.g. a house or an office). By constraining a robot to stay
in a limited territory, we can ensure that the robot has seen most objects
before and the speed of introducing a new object is slow. Furthermore, we can
build a 3D map of the environment to reliably subtract the background to make
recognition easier. We propose extremely robust algorithms to obtain a 3D map
and enable humans to collectively annotate objects. During testing time, our
algorithm can recognize all objects very reliably, and query humans from crowd
sourcing platform if confidence is low or new objects are identified. This
paper explains design decisions in building such a system, and constructs a
benchmark for extensive evaluation. Experiments suggest that making robot
vision appear to be working from an end user's perspective is a reachable goal
today, as long as the robot stays in a closed environment. By formulating this
task, we hope to lay the foundation of a new direction in vision for robotics.

the 2-point correlations of CMB data, using the hybrid approach employed
previously: pixel-based at $\ell<30$ and a Gaussian approximation to the
distribution of spectra at higher $\ell$. The main improvements are the use of
more and better processed data and of Planck polarization data, and more
detailed foreground and instrumental models, allowing further checks and
enhanced immunity to systematics. Progress in foreground modelling enables a
larger sky fraction. Improvements in processing and instrumental models further
reduce uncertainties. For temperature, we perform an analysis of end-to-end
instrumental simulations fed into the data processing pipeline; this does not
reveal biases from residual instrumental systematics. The $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model continues to offer a very good fit to Planck data. The slope
of primordial scalar fluctuations, $n_s$, is confirmed smaller than unity at
more than 5{\sigma} from Planck alone. We further validate robustness against
specific extensions to the baseline cosmology. E.g., the effective number of
neutrino species remains compatible with the canonical value of 3.046. This
first detailed analysis of Planck polarization concentrates on E modes. At low
$\ell$ we use temperature at all frequencies and a subset of polarization. The
frequency range improves CMB-foreground separation. Within the baseline model
this requires a reionization optical depth $\tau=0.078\pm0.019$, significantly
lower than without high-frequency data for explicit dust monitoring. At high
$\ell$ we detect residual errors in E, typically O($\mu$K$^2$); we recommend
temperature alone as the high-$\ell$ baseline. Nevertheless, Planck high-$\ell$
polarization allows a separate determination of $\Lambda$CDM parameters
consistent with those from temperature alone.

consider a Paraconsistent Approach to Quantum Superpositions (PAQS). We claimed
that, even though most interpretations of quantum mechanics (QM) attempt to
escape contradictions, there are many hints -coming from present technical and
experimental developments in QM- that indicate it could be worth while to
engage in a research of this kind. Recently, Arenhart and Krause have raised
several arguments against the PAQS [1, 2, 3]. In [11, 12] it was argued that
their reasoning presupposes a metaphysical stance according to which the
physical representation of reality must be exclusively considered in terms of
the equation: Actuality = Reality. However, from a different metaphysical
standpoint their problems disappear. It was also argued that, if we accept the
idea that quantum superpositions exist in a (contradictory) potential realm, it
makes perfect sense to develop QM in terms of a paraconsistent approach and
claim that quantum superpositions are contradictory, contextual existents.

conditional expectations. As an illustration for an asymmetric result, we prove
that for $1 < p < 2$ and $x \in L_p(\M,\tau)$ one can find $a, b \in
L_p(\M,\tau)$ and contractions $u_n, v_n \in \M$ such that $$\E_n(x) = a u_n +

row/column Hardy spaces $\H_p^r(\M)$ and $\H_p^c(\M)$ respectively. In
particular, this solves a problem posed by Defant and Junge in 2004. In the
case $p=1$, our results establish a noncommutative form of Davis celebrated
theorem on the relation between martingale maximal and square functions in
$L_1$, whose noncommutative form has remained open for quite some time. Given
$1 \le p \le 2$, we also provide new weak type maximal estimates, which imply
in turn left/right almost uniform convergence of $\E_n(x)$ in row/column Hardy
spaces. This improves the bilateral convergence known so far. Our approach is
based on new forms of Davis martingale decomposition which are of independent
interest, and an algebraic atomic description for the involved Hardy spaces.
The latter results are new even for commutative von Neumann algebras.

luminosity of inverse Compton scattered photons. It is described by a
non-linear loop of radiative processes that sets in for high values of the
electron compactness and is responsible for the efficient transfer of energy
from electrons to photons, predominantly through inverse Compton scatterings.
We search for the conditions that drive a magnetized non-thermal source to the
inverse Compton catastrophe regime and study its multi-wavelength (MW) photon
spectrum. We develop a generic analytical framework and use numerical
calculations as a backup to the analytical predictions. We find that the
escaping radiation from a source in the Compton catastrophe regime bears some
unique features. The MW photon spectrum is a broken power law with a break at
$\sim m_e c^2$ due to the onset of the Klein-Nishina suppression. The spectral
index below the break energy depends on the electron and magnetic compactnesses
logarithmically, while it is independent of the electron power-law index ($s$).
The maximum radiating power emerges typically in the $\gamma$-ray regime, at
energies $\sim m_e c^2$ ($\sim \gamma_{\max} m_e c^2$ ) for $s>2$ ($s\lesssim
2$), where $\gamma_{\max}$ is the maximum Lorentz factor of the injected
electron distribution. We apply the principles of the inverse Compton
catastrophe to blazars and $\gamma$-ray bursts using the analytical framework
we developed, and show how these can be used to impose robust constraints on
the source parameters.

need, neuropharmacology and neurostimulation therapies for chronic pain have
been associated with suboptimal efficacy and limited long-term success, as
their mechanisms of action are unclear. Yet current computational models of
pain transmission suffer from several limitations. In particular, dorsal column
models do not include the fundamental underlying sensory activity traveling in
these nerve fibers. We developed a (simple) simulation test bed of electrical
neurostimulation of myelinated nerve fibers with underlying sensory activity.
This paper reports our findings so far. Interactions between stimulation-evoked
and underlying activities are mainly due to collisions of action potentials and
losses of excitability due to the refractory period following an action
potential. In addition, intuitively, the reliability of sensory activity
decreases as the stimulation frequency increases. This first step opens the
door to a better understanding of pain transmission and its modulation by
neurostimulation therapies.

theoretically predicted antideuteron flux resulting from secondary interactions
of primary cosmic rays is very low. Well-motivated theories beyond the Standard
Model contain viable dark matter candidates, which could lead to a significant
enhancement of the antideuteron flux due to annihilation or decay of dark
matter particles. This flux contribution is believed to be especially large at
low energies, which leads to a high discovery potential for GAPS. The GAPS
low-energy antiproton search will provide some of the most stringent
constraints on ~30GeV dark matter, will provide the best limits on primordial
black hole evaporation on galactic length scales, and explore new discovery
space in cosmic-ray physics.
  GAPS is designed to achieve its goals via long duration balloon flights at
high altitude in Antarctica. The detector itself will consist of 10 planes of
Si(Li) solid state detectors and a surrounding time-of-flight system.
Antideuterons and antiprotons will be slowed down in the Si(Li) material,
replace a shell electron and form an excited exotic atom. The atom will be
deexcited by characteristic X-ray transitions and will end its life by the
formation of an annihilation pion/proton star. This unique event structure will
deliver a nearly background free detection possibility.

social welfare resulting from strategic behavior of the schools, employers, and

loss due to unraveling of the matching market, the strategic behavior of
students and employers in offering early contracts with the goal to improve the
quality. Our goal is to evaluate if strategic grading or unraveling of the
market (or a combination of the two) can cause significant welfare loss
compared to the optimal assignment of students to jobs. To measure welfare of
the assignment, we assume that welfare resulting from a job -- student pair is
a separable and monotone function of student ability and the quality of the
jobs. Assuming uniform student quality distribution, we show that the quality
loss from the above strategic manipulation is bounded by at most a factor of 2,
and give improved bounds for some special cases of welfare functions.

objects. To that end, we define ABA-detecting registers, which are similar to
normal read/write registers, except that they allow a process q to detect with
a read operation, whether some process wrote the register since q's last read.
ABA-detecting registers can be implemented trivially from a single unbounded
register, but we show that they have a high complexity if base objects are
bounded: An obstruction-free implementation of an ABA-detecting single bit
register cannot be implemented from fewer than n-1 bounded registers. Moreover,
bounded CAS objects (or more generally, conditional read-modify-write
primitives) offer little help to implement ABA-detecting single bit registers:
We prove a linear time-space tradeoff for such implementations. We show that
the same time-space tradeoff holds for implementations of single bit LL/SC
primitives from bounded writable CAS objects. This proves that the
implementations of LL/SC/VL by Anderson and Moir (1995) as well as Jayanti and
Petrovic (2003) are optimal. We complement our lower bounds with tight upper
bounds: We give an implementation of ABA-detecting registers from n+1 bounded
registers, which has step complexity O(1). We also show that (bounded) LL/SC/VL
can be implemented from a single bounded CAS object and with O(n) step
complexity. Both upper bounds are asymptotically optimal with respect to their
time-space product. These results give formal evidence that the ABA problem is
inherently difficult, that even writable CAS objects do not provide significant
benefits over registers for dealing with the ABA problem itself, and that there
is no hope of finding a more efficient implementation of LL/SC/VL from bounded
CAS objects and registers than the ones mentioned.

galaxy clusters. The Hitomi measurements of gas motions in the core of the
Perseus Cluster have provided insights into the physics in galaxy clusters. The
XARM mission, equipped with the Resolve X-ray micro-calorimeter, will continue
Hitomi's legacy by measuring ICM motions through Doppler shifting and
broadening of emission lines in a larger number of galaxy clusters, and at
larger radii. In this work, we investigate how well we can measure bulk and
turbulent gas motions in the ICM with XARM, by analyzing mock XARM simulations
of galaxy clusters extracted from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We
assess how photon counts, spectral fitting methods, multiphase ICM structure,
deprojections, and region selection affect the measurements of gas motions. We
first show that XARM is capable of recovering the underlying spherically
averaged turbulent and bulk velocity profiles for dynamically relaxed clusters
to within $\sim 50\%$ with a reasonable amount of photon counts in the X-ray
emission lines. We also find that there are considerable azimuthal variations
in the ICM velocities, where the velocities measured in a single azimuthal
direction can significantly deviate from the true value even in dynamically
relaxed systems. Such variation must be taken into account when interpreting
data and developing observing strategies. We will discuss the prospect of using
the upcoming XARM mission to measure non-thermal pressure and to correct for
the hydrostatic mass bias of galaxy clusters. Our results are broadly
applicable for future X-ray missions, such as Athena and Lynx.

the present-day stellar mass of cluster members, and the effects of adiabatic

two-stage sampling designs, sampling households at the first stage, followed by
a second stage sample that differs across demographic groups. Two-stage designs
are usually constructed by simple random sampling (SRS) of households and
proportional within-household sampling, or probability proportional to size
sampling (PPS) of households with fixed sampling within each. No measure of
household size is proportional for all demographic groups, putting PPS schemes
at a disadvantage. The SRS schemes have the disadvantage that multiple
individuals sampled per household decreases efficiency due to intra-household
correlation. We conduct a simulation study (using both design- and model-based
survey inference) to understand these tradeoffs and recommend a sampling plan

studies with surveys that target different demographic groups.

can automatically tag a novel data point with the most relevant subset of
labels from an extremely large label set. Embedding based approaches make
training and prediction tractable by assuming that the training label matrix is
low-rank and hence the effective number of labels can be reduced by projecting
the high dimensional label vectors onto a low dimensional linear subspace.
Still, leading embedding approaches have been unable to deliver high prediction
accuracies or scale to large problems as the low rank assumption is violated in
most real world applications.
  This paper develops the X-One classifier to address both limitations. The
main technical contribution in X-One is a formulation for learning a small
ensemble of local distance preserving embeddings which can accurately predict
infrequently occurring (tail) labels. This allows X-One to break free of the
traditional low-rank assumption and boost classification accuracy by learning
embeddings which preserve pairwise distances between only the nearest label
vectors.
  We conducted extensive experiments on several real-world as well as benchmark
data sets and compared our method against state-of-the-art methods for extreme
multi-label classification. Experiments reveal that X-One can make
significantly more accurate predictions then the state-of-the-art methods
including both embeddings (by as much as 35%) as well as trees (by as much as
6%). X-One can also scale efficiently to data sets with a million labels which
are beyond the pale of leading embedding methods.

Submitted to PRL",,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a recent letter, Stenull and Lubensky claim that periodic approximants of
Penrose tilings, which are generically isostatic, have a nonzero bulk modulus B
when disordered, and, therefore, Penrose tilings are good models of jammed
packings. The claim of a nonzero B, which is made on the basis of a normal mode
analysis of periodic Penrose approximants for a single value of the disorder
epsilon, is the central point of their letter: other properties of Penrose
tilings, such as the vanishing of the shear modulus, and a flat density of
vibrational states, are already shared by most geometrically disordered
isostatic networks studied so far. In this comment, Conjugate Gradient is used
to solve the elastic equations on approximants with up to 8x10^4 sites for
several values of epsilon, to show beyond reasonable doubt that Stenull and
Lubensky's claim is incorrect. The bulk modulus of generic Penrose tilings is
zero asymptotically. According to our results, B grows as (epsilon^2 L^3) when
(epsilon^2 L^3) << 10^2, then saturates, and finally decays as (epsilon^2
L^3)^{-2/3} ~ 1/L^2 for epsilon^2 L^3 >> 10^2. Stenull and Lubensky seem to
have only analyzed one value of epsilon for which saturation is reached at the
largest size studied. This led them to a wrong conclusion. We support our
results by also considering generic Penrose approximants with fixed boundaries,
whose bulk modulus constitutes a strict upper bound for that of periodic
systems, finding that these have a vanishing B as well for large L. We conclude
that the main point in Stenull and Lubensky letter is unjustified. Penrose
tilings are no better models of jammed packings than any of the previously
studied isostatic networks with geometric disorder.

showed significant decrease of absolute value of Seebeck coefficient (S) from
~200 to 23 microV K-1, along with a sharp drop in electrical resistivity (rho),
due to the transition from an insulator to a metal. The MI transition
temperatures observed both in rho (Trho) and S (TS) for the VO2 films
systematically decrease with lattice shrinkage in the pseudo-rutile structure
along c-axis, accompanying a broadening of the MI transition temperature width.
Moreover, the onset TS, where the insulating phase starts to become metallic,
is much lower than onset Trho. This difference is attributed to the sensitivity
of S for the detection of hidden metallic domains in the majority insulating
phase, which cannot be detected in rho-measurements. Consequently,
S-measurements provide a straightforward and excellent approach for a deeper
understanding of the MI transition process in VO2.

dynamically arrested but statistically sampled. We examine the improvements
afforded by this approximation by comparing with exact results for the
spin-boson model over a wide range of parameter space. The results from the

manner based on their individual delay requirements. Simulation results show
that the proposed scheme achieves a near optimal rate performance and at the
same time guarantees the delay requirements of the devices. We further propose
a simple random access strategy and characterized the required overhead.
Simulation results show the proposed approach significantly outperforms the
existing random access schemes currently used in long term evolution advanced
(LTE-A) standard in terms of the access delay.

in many areas of computer vision and machine learning. While these matrices

for dictionary learning and sparse coding in which the representation loss is
characterized via the affine invariant Riemannian metric. We also present a

Pad\'e approximation to the density of complex poles with the increase of the

connected by branch cuts. The converging densities are the jumps across the
branch cuts. There is one branch cut per horizontal spatial period $\lambda$ of

interactions, including strong and even ultra-strong coupling, have been
demonstrated. One distinct advantage of these systems is that the spins are in
the form of well-defined magnon modes, which allows flexible and precise
tuning. Here we demonstrate that by dissipation engineering, a non-Markovian
interaction dynamics between the magnon and the microwave cavity photon can be
achieved. Such a process enables us to build a magnon gradient memory to store
information in the magnon dark modes, which decouple from the microwave cavity
and thus preserve a long life-time. Our findings provide a promising approach
for developing long-lifetime, multimode quantum memories.

r. The parameters n, k, r, t are positive integers such that r<k<n and t <=

we mean that the t' newcomers are ordered in a proper sequence such that each
newcomer can be repaired from the live nodes and the newcomers that are ordered
before it. Such codes, which we refer to as (n, k, r, t)-functional locally
repairable codes (FLRC), are the most general class of LRCs and contain several
subclasses of LRCs reported in the literature.
  In this paper, we aim to optimize the storage overhead (equivalently, the
code rate) of FLRCs. We derive a lower bound on the code length n given t
belongs to {2,3} and any possible k, r. For t=2, our bound generalizes the rate
bound proved in [14]. For t=3, our bound improves the rate bound proved in
[10]. We also give some onstructions of exact LRCs for t belongs to {2,3} whose
length n achieves the bound of (n, k, r, t)-FLRC, which proves the tightness of
our bounds and also implies that there is no gap between the optimal code
length of functional LRCs and exact LRCs for certain sets of parameters.
Moreover, our constructions are over the binary field, hence are of interest in

context of bimetric gravity. The aim is to solve the problems of cold dark
matter (CDM) at galactic scales, and to reproduce the phenomenology of the
modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), while still being in agreement with the
standard cosmological model $\Lambda$-CDM at large scales. In this context a
promising alternative is dipolar dark matter (DDM) in which two different
species of dark matter particles are separately coupled to the two metrics of
bigravity and are linked together by an internal vector field. The
phenomenology of MOND then results from a mechanism of gravitational
polarization. Probably the best formulation of the model is within the
framework of recently developed massive bigravity theories. Then the
gravitational sector of the model is safe by construction, but a ghostly degree
of freedom in the decoupling limit is still present in the dark matter sector.
Future work should analyse the cosmological solutions of the model and check
the post-Newtonian parameters in the solar system.

have \begin{equation}\label{*} D(p^n||q^n)\leq Const. \sum_{i=1}^n \Bbb E_{p^n}

depend on the properties of the local specifications of $q^n$.
  Inequality (*) is meaningful in product spaces, both in the discrete and the
continuous case, and can be used to prove a logarithmic Sobolev inequality for
$q^n$, provided uniform logarithmic Sobolev inequalities are available for
$q_i(\cdot|x_1,\dots, x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\dots, x_n)$, for all fixed $i$ and all

implies that the Gibbs sampler associated with $q^n$ is a contraction for
relative entropy.
  We derive inequality (*), and thereby a logarithmic Sobolev inequality, in
discrete product spaces, by proving inequalities for an appropriate
Wasserstein-like distance. A logarithmic Sobolev inequality is, roughly
speaking, a contractivity property of relative entropy with respect to some
Markov semigroup. It is much easier to prove contractivity for a distance
between measures than for relative entropy, since distances satisfy the
triangle inequality, and for them well known linear tools, like estimates
through matrix norms can be applied.

their ability to evolve further, i.e. evolvability. The knowledge about how
food web evolvability is determined by the structures of diverse ecological
networks can guide human interventions purposefully to either promote or limit
evolvability of ecosystems. However, the focus of prior food web studies was on
stability and robustness; little is known regarding the impact of ecological
network structures on their evolvability. To correlate ecosystem structure and
evolvability, we adopt the NK model originally from evolutionary biology to
generate and assess the ruggedness of fitness landscapes of a wide spectrum of
model food webs with gradual variation in the amount of feeding loops and link
density. The variation in network structures is controlled by linkage rewiring.
Our results show that more feeding loops and lower trophic link density, i.e.
higher autonomy of species, of food webs increase the potential for the
ecosystem to generate heritable variations with improved fitness. Our findings
allow the prediction of the evolvability of actual food webs according to their
network structures, and provide guidance to enhancing or controlling the
evolvability of specific ecosystems.

the central velocity dispersion of the galactic globular cluster NGC 6388 with
different methods. While L\""utzgendorf et al. (2011) found a rising profile and
a high central velocity dispersion (23.3 km/s), measurements obtained by
Lanzoni et al. (2013) showed a value 40% lower. The value of the central
velocity dispersion has a serious impact on the mass and possible presence of
an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of NGC 6388. We use a photometric
catalog of NGC 6388 to create a simulated SINFONI and ARGUS dataset. The
construction of the IFU data cube is done with different observing conditions
reproducing the conditions reported for the original observations as closely as
possible. In addition, we produce an N-body realization of a 10^6 M_SUN stellar
cluster with the same photometric properties as NGC 6388 to account for
unresolved stars. We find that the individual radial velocities, i.e. the
measurements from the simulated SINFONI data, are systematically biased towards
lower velocity dispersions. The reason is that due to the wings in the point
spread function the velocities get biased towards the mean cluster velocity.
This study shows that even with AO supported observations, individual radial
velocities in crowded fields are likely to be biased. The ARGUS observations do
not show this kind of bias but were found to have larger uncertainties than
previously obtained. We find a bias towards higher velocity dispersions in the
ARGUS pointing when fixing the extreme velocities of the three brightest stars
but find those variations are within the determined uncertainties. We rerun
Jeans models and fit the kinematic profile with the new uncertainties. This
yields a BH mass of M_BH = (2.8 +- 0.4) x 10^4 M_SUN and M/L ratio M/L = (1.6
+- 0.1) M_SUN/L_SUN, consistent with our previous results.

black-body stellar emission for an M7 class dwarf star, the stellar UV
irradiation was increased stepwise and the resulting climate-photochemical
response of the planetary atmosphere was calculated. Results suggest a
Goldilocks effect with respect to the spectral detection of ozone. At weak UV
levels, the ozone column was weak (due to weaker production from the Chapman
mechanism) hence its spectral detection was challenging. At strong UV levels,
ozone formation is stronger but its associated stratospheric heating leads to a
weakening in temperature gradients between the stratosphere and troposphere,
which results in weakened spectral bands. Also, increased UV levels can lead to
enhanced abundances of hydrogen oxides which oppose the ozone formation effect.
At intermediate UV (i.e. with x10 the stellar UV radiative flux of black body
Planck curves corresponding to spectral class M7) the conditions are just right
for spectral detection. Results suggest that the planetary O3 profile is
sensitive to the UV output of the star from about(200-350) nm. We also
investigated the effect of increasing the top-of-atmosphere incoming
Lyman-alpha radiation but this had only a minimal effect on the biosignatures
since it was efficiently absorbed in the uppermost planetary atmospheric layer,
mainly by abundant methane. Earlier studies have suggested that the planetary
methane is an important stratospheric heater which critically affects the
vertical temperature gradient, hence the strength of spectral emission bands.

change very rapidly. During some period, resonance condition between the

The TAB framework is inspired by the principles of neural population coding
operating in the biological nervous system. Three neuronal layers, namely
input, hidden, and output, constitute the TAB framework, with the number of
hidden layer neurons far exceeding the input layer neurons. Here, we present
measurement results of the first prototype TAB chip built using a 65nm process
technology and show its learning capability for various regression tasks. Our
TAB chip exploits inherent randomness and variability arising due to the
fabrication process to perform various learning tasks. Additionally, we
characterise each neuron and discuss the statistical variability of its tuning
curve that arises due to random device mismatch, a desirable property for the
learning capability of the TAB. We also discuss the effect of the number of
hidden neurons and the resolution of output weights on the accuracy of the
learning capability of the TAB.

gyro-kinetic code GKW. The interaction of electromagnetic turbulence with a
self-consistently growing magnetic island, generated by a tearing unstable
$\Delta' > 0$ current profile, is considered. The turbulence is able to seed
the magnetic island and bypass the linear growth phase by generating structures
that are approximately an ion gyro-radius in width. The non-linear evolution of
the island width and its rotation frequency, after this seeding phase, is found
to be modified and is dependent on the value of the plasma beta and equilibrium
pressure gradients. At low values of beta the island evolves largely
independent of the turbulence, while at higher values the interaction has a
dramatic effect on island growth, causing the island to grow exponentially at
the growth rate of its linear phase, even though the island is larger than
linear theory validity. The turbulence forces the island to rotate in the
ion-diamagnetic direction as opposed to the electron diamagnetic direction in
which it rotates when no turbulence is present. In addition, it is found that
the mode rotation slows as the island grows in size.

in the dispersing medium is varied systematically, viscoelasticity and yield
stress of the dispersion show non-monotonic behavior at a critical salt
concentration, thus signifying a morphological change in the dispersion
microstructures. We directly visualize the microscopic structures of these

observe the existence of honeycomb-like network morphologies for a wide range

overlapping coin (OC) and house of cards (HoC) associations of clay particles
at low salt concentrations to a new network structure dominated by face-face
coagulation of platelets, is observed across the critical salt concentration.
We further assess the stability of these gels under gravity using

with time-dependent parameters, defined by the volatility dynamics
$dV_{t}=\kappa_{t}\left(\theta_{t}-V_{t}\right)dt+\lambda_{t}V_{t}dB_{t}$. This
non-affine model is much more realistic than classical affine models like the
Heston stochastic volatility model, even though both are as parsimonious (only
four stochastic parameters). Indeed, it provides more realistic volatility
distribution and volatility paths, which translate in practice into more robust
calibration and better hedging accuracy, explaining its popularity among
practitioners. In order to price vanilla options with IGa volatility, we
propose a closed-form volatility-of-volatility expansion. Specifically, the
price of a European put option with IGa volatility is approximated by a
Black-Scholes price plus a weighted combination of Black-Scholes greeks, where
the weights depend only on the four time-dependent parameters of the model.
This closed-form pricing method allows for very fast pricing and calibration to
market data. The overall quality of the approximation is very good, as shown by
several calibration tests on real-world market data where expansion prices are
compared favorably with Monte Carlo simulation results. This paper shows that
the IGa model is as simple, more realistic, easier to implement and faster to
calibrate than classical transform-based affine models. We therefore hope that
the present work will foster further research on non-affine models like the
Inverse Gamma stochastic volatility model, all the more so as this robust model
is of great interest to the industry.

can be achieved in two ways. One is to find groups of actors and present only

similar roles and to construct a smaller network in which the connection
between the actors would be replaced with connections between the roles.
Classifying actors by the roles they are playing in the network can help to
understand 'who is who' in a social network. This classification can be very

context-free grammar that generates the string, is a simple and powerful
paradigm that captures many popular compression schemes. Given a grammar, the
random access problem is to compactly represent the grammar while supporting
random access, that is, given a position in the original uncompressed string
report the character at that position. In this paper we study the random access
problem with the finger search property, that is, the time for a random access
query should depend on the distance between a specified index $f$, called the
\emph{finger}, and the query index $i$. We consider both a static variant,
where we first place a finger and subsequently access indices near the finger
efficiently, and a dynamic variant where also moving the finger such that the
time depends on the distance moved is supported.
  Let $n$ be the size the grammar, and let $N$ be the size of the string. For
the static variant we give a linear space representation that supports placing
the finger in $O(\log N)$ time and subsequently accessing in $O(\log D)$ time,
where $D$ is the distance between the finger and the accessed index. For the
dynamic variant we give a linear space representation that supports placing the
finger in $O(\log N)$ time and accessing and moving the finger in $O(\log D +
\log \log N)$ time. Compared to the best linear space solution to random
access, we improve a $O(\log N)$ query bound to $O(\log D)$ for the static
variant and to $O(\log D + \log \log N)$ for the dynamic variant, while
maintaining linear space. As an application of our results we obtain an
improved solution to the longest common extension problem in grammar compressed
strings. To obtain our results, we introduce several new techniques of
independent interest, including a novel van Emde Boas style decomposition of

are now close to the maximum of the subsequent solar cycle, which is relatively
weak. In this article we make comparisons between different global (unresolved)
measures of the Sun's magnetic activity, to investigate how they are responding
to this weak-activity epoch. We focus on helioseismic data, which are sensitive
to conditions, including the characteristics of the magnetic field, in the
solar interior. Also considered are measures of the magnetic field in the
photosphere (sunspot number and sunspot area), the chromosphere and corona
(10.7cm radio flux and 530.3nm green coronal index), and two measures of the
Sun's magnetic activity closer to Earth (the interplanetary magnetic field and
the galactic cosmic-ray intensity). Scaled versions of the activity proxies
diverge from the helioseismic data around 2000, indicating a change in
relationship between the proxies. The degree of divergence varies from proxy to
proxy with sunspot area and 10.7cm flux showing only small deviations, while
sunspot number, coronal index, and the two interplanetary proxies show much
larger departures. In Cycle 24 the deviations in the solar proxies and the
helioseismic data decrease, raising the possibility that the deviations
observed in Cycle 23 are just symptomatic of a 22-year Hale cycle. However, the
deviations in the helioseismic data and the interplanetary proxies increase in
Cycle 24. Interestingly the divergence in the solar proxies and the
helioseismic data are not reflected in the shorter-term variations (often
referred to as quasi-biennial oscillations) observed on top of the dominant
11-year solar cycle. However, despite being highly correlated in Cycle 22, the
short-term variations in the interplanetary proxies show very little
correlation with the helioseismic data during Cycles 23 and 24.

description of spin-state chemistry in reactions involving chemical species
with multiple deuterons. We apply the model to the specific case of deuterated
ammonia, to derive values for the various spin-state ratios.
  Methods. We apply symmetry rules in the complete scrambling assumption to
calculate branching ratio tables for reactions between chemical species that
include multiple protons and/or deuterons. Reaction sets for both gas-phase and
grain-surface chemistry are generated using an automated routine that forms all
possible spin-state variants of any given reaction with up to six H/D atoms.
Single-point and modified Bonnor-Ebert models are used to study the density and
temperature dependence of ammonia and its isotopologs, and the associated
spin-state ratios.
  Results. We find that the spin-state ratios of the ammonia isotopologs are,
at late times, very different from their statistical values. The ratios are
rather insensitive to variations in the density, but present strong temperature
dependence. We derive high peak values ($\sim$ 0.1) for the deuterium fraction
in ammonia, in agreement with previous (gas-phase) models. The deuterium
fractionation is strongest at high density, corresponding to a high degree of
depletion, and also presents temperature dependence. We find that in the
temperature range 5 to 20 K, the deuterium fractionation peaks at $\sim$ 15 K
while most of the ortho/para (and meta/para for $\rm ND_3$) ratios present a
minimum at 10 K (ortho/para $\rm NH_2D$ has instead a maximum at this
temperature).
  Conclusions. Owing to the density and temperature dependence found in the
abundances and spin-state ratios of ammonia and its isotopologs, it is evident
that observations of ammonia and its deuterated forms can provide important
constraints on the physical structure of molecular clouds.

(at least partly) rely on spectroscopic data, an efficient tool for the
analysis of medium- to high-resolution spectroscopy is needed. We aim at
developing an efficient software package for the analysis of medium- to
high-resolution spectroscopy of single stars and those in binary systems. The
major requirements are that the code has a high performance, represents the
state-of-the-art analysis tool, and provides accurate determinations of
atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions for different types of stars.
We use the method of atmosphere models and spectrum synthesis, which is one of
the most commonly used approaches for the analysis of stellar spectra. Our Grid
Search in Stellar Parameters (GSSP) code makes use of the OpenMPI
implementation, which makes it possible to run in parallel mode. The method is
first tested on the simulated data and is then applied to the spectra of real
stellar objects. The majority of test runs on the simulated data were
successful in the sense that we could recover the initially assumed sets of
atmospheric parameters. We experimentally find the limits in signal-to-noise
ratios of the input spectra, below which the final set of parameters gets
significantly affected by the noise. Application of the GSSP package to the
spectra of three Kepler stars, KIC11285625, KIC6352430, and KIC4931738, was
also largely successful. We found an overall agreement of the final sets of the
fundamental parameters with the original studies. For KIC6352430, we found that
dependence of the light dilution factor on wavelength cannot be ignored, as it
has significant impact on the determination of the atmospheric parameters of
this binary system.

generating a maximal-rate secret key (SK) within the multiterminal source model
of Csisz{\'a}r and Narayan. Building on the prior work of Tyagi for the
two-terminal scenario, we derive a lower bound on the communication complexity,
$R_{\text{SK}}$, defined to be the minimum rate of public communication needed
to generate a maximal-rate SK. It is well known that the minimum rate of
communication for omniscience, denoted by $R_{\text{CO}}$, is an upper bound on
$R_{\text{SK}}$. For the class of pairwise independent network (PIN) models
defined on uniform hypergraphs, we show that a certain ""Type $\mathcal{S}$""
condition, which is verifiable in polynomial time, guarantees that our lower
bound on $R_{\text{SK}}$ meets the $R_{\text{CO}}$ upper bound. Thus, PIN
models satisfying our condition are $R_{\text{SK}}$-maximal, meaning that the
upper bound $R_{\text{SK}} \le R_{\text{CO}}$ holds with equality. This allows
us to explicitly evaluate $R_{\text{SK}}$ for such PIN models. We also give
several examples of PIN models that satisfy our Type $\mathcal S$ condition.
Finally, we prove that for an arbitrary multiterminal source model, a stricter
version of our Type $\mathcal S$ condition implies that communication from
\emph{all} terminals (""omnivocality"") is needed for establishing a SK of
maximum rate. For three-terminal source models, the converse is also true:
omnivocality is needed for generating a maximal-rate SK only if the strict Type
$\mathcal S$ condition is satisfied. Counterexamples exist that show that the
converse is not true in general for source models with four or more terminals.

Euclidean bulk. In its ground state, the brane constituent matter is assumed to
be homogeneous and isotropic, and of negligible influence on the bulk geometry.
The analysis of this paper is model independent, in the sense that action
functional of bulk fields is not specified. Instead, the behavior of the brane
is derived from the universally valid conservation equation of the bulk stress
tensor. The present work studies the behavior of a $3$-sphere in the
$5$-dimensional Euclidean bulk. The sphere is made of bulk matter characterized
by the equation of state $p=\alpha\rho$. It is shown that stability of brane
vibrations requires $\alpha < 0$. Then, the stable brane perturbations obey
Klein-Gordon-like equation with an effective metric of Minkowski signature. The
argument is given that it is this effective metric that is detected in physical
measurements. The corresponding effective Universe is analyzed for all the
values of $\alpha<0$. In particular, the effective metric is shown to be a
solution of Einstein's equations coupled to an effective perfect fluid. The
effective energy density and pressure at the present epoch are calculated. So
are the age of the Universe, and the effective cosmological constant. All the
results are presented in two tables. As an illustration, one simple choice of
the brane constituent matter is studied in detail.

dramatic increase in the number of IR-selected quasars. Using forced-photometry
on public WISE data at the locations of SDSS point sources, we incorporate this

select quasars from optical photometry. The combination of WISE and SDSS

Due to the presence of linear bands close to the Fermi energy in the electronic
structure of both structures, the Raman scattering by phonons is resonant. We
find that the Raman spectra exhibit a crossover behavior for laser excitation
close to the \pi-plasmon energy. This phenomenon is explained by the
disappearance of certain paths for resonant Raman scattering and the appearance
of other paths beyond this energy. Besides that, the electronic joint density
of states is divergent at this energy, which is reflected on the behavior of
the Raman bands of the two structures in a qualitatively different way.
Additionally, a number of Raman bands, originating from divergent phonon
density of states at the M point and at points, inside the Brillouin zone, is
also predicted. The calculated spectra for graphene are in excellent agreement
with available experimental data. The obtained Raman bands can be used for
structural characterization of silicene and graphene samples by Raman

consists of various demands on different resources. The player's utility is at
most the sum of these demands, provided they are fully satisfied. Every
resource has a limited capacity and if it is exceeded by the total demand, it
has to be split between the players. Since these games generally do not have
pure Nash equilibria, we consider approximate pure Nash equilibria, in which no
player can improve her utility by more than some fixed factor $\alpha$ through
unilateral strategy changes. There is a threshold $\alpha_\delta$ (where
$\delta$ is a parameter that limits the demand of each player on a specific
resource) such that $\alpha$-approximate pure Nash equilibria always exist for
$\alpha \geq \alpha_\delta$, but not for $\alpha < \alpha_\delta$. We give both
upper and lower bounds on this threshold $\alpha_\delta$ and show that the
corresponding decision problem is ${\sf NP}$-hard. We also show that the
$\alpha$-approximate price of anarchy for BAGs is $\alpha+1$. For a restricted
version of the game, where demands of players only differ slightly from each
other (e.g. symmetric games), we show that approximate Nash equilibria can be
reached (and thus also be computed) in polynomial time using the best-response
dynamic. Finally, we show that a broader class of utility-maximization games
(which includes BAGs) converges quickly towards states whose social welfare is
close to the optimum.

new strong curvature fixed point that obeys scaling below the upper critical
dimension $d_{uc}=4$. The exponents of this fixed point are given by the
leading order terms of the $1/N$ expansion. In distinction to flat space no
order $1/N$ corrections occur. We conclude that the description of

elements such as Mg and Si. This is due to the fact that the samples available
for study all originate from relatively shallow depths. Comparison of the
stable isotope compositions of planets and meteorites can help overcome this
limitation. Specifically, the non-chondritic Si isotope composition of the
Earth's mantle was interpreted to reflect the presence of Si in the core, which
can also explain its low density relative to pure Fe-Ni alloy. However, we have
found that angrite meteorites display a heavy Si isotope composition similar to
the lunar and terrestrial mantles. Because core formation in the angrite
parent-body (APB) occurred under oxidizing conditions at relatively low
pressure and temperature, significant incorporation of Si in the core is ruled
out as an explanation for this heavy Si isotope signature. Instead, we show
that equilibrium isotopic fractionation between gaseous SiO and solid
forsterite at 1370 K in the solar nebula could have produced the observed Si
isotope variations. Nebular fractionation of forsterite should be accompanied
by correlated variations between the Si isotopic composition and Mg/Si ratio
following a slope of 1, which is observed in meteorites. Consideration of this
nebular process leads to a revised Si concentration in the Earth's core of 3.6

explaining the magnetars' persistent X-ray emission, the properties of the

this paper is to present a comprehensive overview in which the observational

Empirical studies of networks indicate that many real-world networks have a
power-law distribution of the vertices which in turn implies the number of
edges scale slower than quadratically in the number of vertices. These
assumptions are fundamentally irreconcilable as the Aldous-Hoover theorem
implies quadratic scaling of the number of edges. Recently Caron and Fox (2014)
proposed the use of a different notion of exchangeability due to Kallenberg
(2009) and obtained a network model which admits power-law behaviour while
retaining desirable statistical properties, however this model does not capture
latent vertex traits such as block-structure. In this work we re-introduce the
use of block-structure for network models obeying Kallenberg's notion of
exchangeability and thereby obtain a model which admits the inference of
block-structure and edge inhomogeneity. We derive a simple expression for the
likelihood and an efficient sampling method. The obtained model is not
significantly more difficult to implement than existing approaches to
block-modelling and performs well on real network datasets.

example of such unusual features, since it produces an exotic static-like
regime where the electromagnetic field is spatially slowly-varying over a
physically large region. The so-called epsilon-near-zero metamaterials thus
offer an ideal platform where to manipulate the inner details of the

able to operate such a manipulation to the point that even a thin slab produces
a dramatic nonlinear pulse transformation, if the dielectric permittivity is
very small within the field bandwidth. The predicted non-resonant releasing of
full nonlinear coupling produced by the epsilon-near-zero condition does not
resort to any field enhancement mechanisms and opens novel routes to exploiting

more geoeffective than inclined shocks with low speed. The strongest
correlation (correlation coefficient R = 0.70) occurs for fixed IP shock speed
and varying the IP shock impact angle. We attribute this result, predicted
previously with simulations, to the fact that frontal shocks compress the
magnetosphere symmetrically from all sides, which is a favorable condition for
the release of magnetic energy stored in the magnetotail, which in turn can
produce moderate to strong auroral substorms, which are then observed by ground

$p$-groups, where $p$ is a prime. First of all, we extend Catanese's
characterisation of abelian Beauville groups to finite $p$-groups satisfying
certain conditions which are much weaker than commutativity. This result
applies to all known families of $p$-groups with a good behaviour with respect
to powers: regular $p$-groups, powerful $p$-groups and more generally potent
$p$-groups, and (generalised) $p$-central $p$-groups. In particular, our
characterisation holds for all $p$-groups of order at most $p^p$, which allows
us to determine the exact number of Beauville groups of order $p^5$, for $p\ge
5$, and of order $p^6$, for $p\ge 7$. On the other hand, we determine which
quotients of the Nottingham group over $\mathbb{F}_p$ are Beauville groups, for
an odd prime $p$. As a consequence, we give the first explicit infinite family
of Beauville $3$-groups, and we show that there are Beauville $3$-groups of
order $3^n$ for every $n\ge 5$.

\gamma$, $\eta \gamma$, $\pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0$, $K^+ K^-$, $K_l K_s$ and includes
the dipion spectrum in the {\tau} decay and some more light meson decay partial
widths. The contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_{th}$ of
these annihilation channels over the range of validity of the HLS model (up to
1.05 GeV) is found much improved compared to its partner derived from
integrating the measured spectra directly. However, most spectra for the
process $e^+ e^- \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ undergo overall scale uncertainties which
dominate the other sources, and one may suspect some bias in the dipion
contribution to $a_{th}$. However, an iterated fit algorithm, shown to lead to
unbiased results by a Monte Carlo study, is defined and applied succesfully to
the $e^+ e^- \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ data samples from CMD2, SND, KLOE, BaBar and
BESSIII. The iterated fit solution is shown to be further improved and leads to
a value for $a_{\mu}$ different from $a_{exp}$ above the 4 $\sigma$ level. The
contribution of the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ intermediate state up to 1.05 GeV to $a_{th}$
derived from the iterated fit benefits from an uncertainty about 3 times
smaller than the corresponding usual estimate. Therefore, global fit techniques
are shown to work and lead to improved unbiased results.

many-body system, such as Bose-Einstein condensates, and its capacity of
information-storage and processing. For deriving the effective theory of modes
in the vicinity of the quantum critical point we develop a new method by
mapping a Bose-Einstein condensate of $N$-particles onto a sigma model with a
continuous global (pseudo)symmetry that mixes bosons of different momenta. The
Bogolyubov modes of the condensate are mapped onto the Goldstone modes of the
sigma model, which become gapless at the critical point. These gapless
Goldstone modes are the quantum carriers of information and entropy. Analyzing
their effective theory, we observe the information-processing properties
strikingly similar to the ones predicted by the black hole portrait. The energy
cost per qubit of information-storage vanishes in the large-$N$ limit and the
total information-storage capacity increases with $N$ either exponentially or
as a power law. The longevity of information-storage also increases with $N$,
whereas the scrambling time in the over-critical regime is controlled by the
Lyapunov exponent and scales logarithmically with $N$. This connection reveals
that the origin of black hole information storage lies in the quantum
criticality of the graviton Bose-gas, and that much simpler systems that can be
manufactured in table-top experiments can exhibit very similar
information-processing dynamics.

frequency shifts of less than 10$^{-16}$. In the optical domain, we

minimum size edge set $F$ from a given edge set $E$ such that $T \cup F$ is
$2$-edge-connected. The best approximation ratio known for TAP is $1.5$. In the
more general Weighted TAP problem, $F$ should be of minimum weight. Weighted
TAP admits several $2$-approximation algorithms w.r.t. to the standard cut
LP-relaxation, but for all of them the performance ratio of $2$ is tight even
for TAP. The problem is equivalent to the problem of covering a laminar set
family. Laminar set families play an important role in the design of
approximation algorithms for connectivity network design problems. In fact,
Weighted TAP is the simplest connectivity network design problem for which a
ratio better than $2$ is not known. Improving this ""natural"" ratio is a major
open problem, which may have implications on many other network design
problems. It seems that achieving this goal requires finding an LP-relaxation
with integrality gap better than $2$, which is a long time open problem even
for TAP. In this paper we introduce such an LP-relaxation and give an algorithm
that computes a feasible solution for TAP of size at most $1.75$ times the
optimal LP value. This gives some hope to break the ratio $2$ for the weighted
case. Our algorithm computes some initial edge set by solving a partial system
of constraints that form the integral edge-cover polytope, and then applies
local search on $3$-leaf subtrees to exchange some of the edges and to add
additional edges. Thus we do not need to solve the LP, and the algorithm runs
roughly in time required to find a minimum weight edge-cover in a general
graph.
