  rootfinding","24 pages, 1 figure",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hidden-variable resultant methods are a class of algorithms for solving
multidimensional polynomial rootfinding problems. In two dimensions, when
significant care is taken, they are competitive practical rootfinders. However,
in higher dimensions they are known to miss zeros, calculate roots to low
precision, and introduce spurious solutions. We show that the hidden variable
resultant method based on the Cayley (Dixon or B\'ezout) matrix is inherently
and spectacularly numerically unstable by a factor that grows exponentially
with the dimension. We also show that the Sylvester matrix for solving
bivariate polynomial systems can square the condition number of the problem. In
other words, two popular hidden variable resultant methods are numerically
unstable, and this mathematically explains the difficulties that are frequently
reported by practitioners. Regardless of how the constructed polynomial
eigenvalue problem is solved, severe numerical difficulties will be present.
Along the way, we prove that the Cayley resultant is a generalization of
Cramer's rule for solving linear systems and generalize Clenshaw's algorithm to
an evaluation scheme for polynomials expressed in a degree-graded polynomial
basis.

transfers in a turbulent von K\'arm\'an flow. The goal is to understand how and
where energy is dissipated in such a flow and to reconstruct the energy cycle
in an experimental device where local as well as global quantities can be
measured. We use PIV measurements and we model the Reynolds stress tensor to
take subgrid scales into account. This procedure involves a free parameter that
is calibrated using angular momentum balance. We then estimate the local and
global mean injected and dissipated power for several types of impellers, for
various Reynolds numbers and for various flow topologies. These PIV estimates
are then compared with direct injected power estimates provided by torque
measurements at the impellers. The agreement between PIV estimates and direct
measurements depends on the flow topology. In symmetric situations, we are able
to capture up to 90% of the actual global energy dissipation rate. However, our
results become increasingly inaccurate as the shear layer responsible for most
of the dissipation approaches one of the impellers, and cannot be resolved by
our PIV set-up. Finally, we show that a very good agreement between PIV
estimates and direct measurements is obtained using a new method based on the
work of Duchon and Robert which generalizes the K\'arm\'an-Howarth equation to
nonisotropic, nonhomogeneous flows. This method provides parameter-free
estimates of the energy dissipation rate as long as the smallest resolved scale
lies in the inertial range. These results are used to evidence a well-defined
stationary energy cycle within the flow in which most of the energy is injected
at the top and bottom impellers, and dissipated within the shear layer. The
influence of the mean flow geometry and the Reynolds number on this energy
cycle is studied for a wide range of parameters.

sequence stars that define the Lupus kinematic association of young stars.
Here, we use these new distances to derive the masses and ages of Lupus T Tauri

disks.
  Methods: Using the photometric and spectroscopic information available in the
literature, we computed the photospheric luminosity of 92 T Tauri stars in the
Lupus association. Then, we estimated their masses and ages from theoretical
evolutionary models. Based on Monte Carlo simulations and statistical tests, we
compare the mass and age distribution of the classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) and
weak-line T Tauri (WTTS) in our sample.
  Results: We show that the CTTSs are on average younger than the WTTSs and
that the probability that both T~Tauri subclasses are drawn from the same mass
and age parental distribution is very low. Our results favor the scenario
proposed earlier for the Taurus-Auriga association, where the CTTSs evolve into
WTTSs when their disks are fully accreted by the star. Based on an empirical
disk model, we find that the average disk lifetime for the T Tauri stars in the
Lupus association is $\tau_{d}=3\times10^{6}\,(M_*/M_{\odot})^{0.55}$ yr.
  Conclusions: We find evidence that the average lifetime of the circumstellar

Intermediate-dispersion spectra are used to derive physical conditions and
abundances across the nebula, and high-dispersion spectra to study the

ratios (~0.9), typical of Type I PNe. On the other hand, its abundances of O,
Ne, S, and Ar are low as compared with the average abundances of Galactic bulge

hour-glass shaped nebula with bipolar expansion, although the morphology and
kinematics of the innermost regions cannot be satisfactorily explained with a
simple, tilted equatorial torus. The spatio-kinematical study confines the
inclination angle of its major axis to be within 10 degrees of the plane of

stratification in the emission peaks of [O III], H_alpha, and [N II] in the

for the bipolar knots of Hu1-2, with He II emission levels above those of
collimated outflows in other Galactic PNe. The excitation of the knots in Hu1-2
is consistent with the combined effects of shocks and UV radiation from the

filled with solid hcp \4he in the pressure range 25.6 - 26.4~bar, rises with
falling temperature and at a temperature $T_d$ the flux drops sharply. The flux
above $T_d$ has characteristics that are consistent with the presence of a
bosonic Luttinger liquid. We study $F$ as a function of $^3$He concentration,
$\chi = 0.17 - 220$~ppm, to explore the effect of $^3$He impurities on the mass
flux. We find that the strong reduction of the flux is a sharp transition,
typically complete within a few mK and a few hundred seconds. Modest
concentration-dependent hysteresis is present. We find that $T_d$ is an
increasing function of $\chi$ and the $T_d(\chi)$ dependence differs somewhat
from the predictions for bulk phase separation for $T_{ps}$ \emph{vs.} $\chi$.
We conclude that $^3$He plays an important role in the flux extinction. The
dependence of $F$ on the solid helium density is also studied. We find that $F$
is sample-dependent, but that the temperature dependence of $F$ above $T_d$ is
universal; data for all samples scales and collapses to a universal temperature
dependence, independent of $^3$He concentration or sample history. The
universal behavior extrapolates to zero flux in the general vicinity of $T_h
\approx 630$~mK. With increases in temperature, it is possible that a thermally
activated process contributes to the degradation of the flux. The possibility
of the role of disorder and the resulting phase slips as quantum defects on

recently, it was shown by Klyachko that this antisymmetry of fermionic wave

exclusion principle. Our first goal is to develop an understanding of the
mathematical concepts behind Klyachko's work, in the context of quantum
marginal problems. Afterwards, we explore the physical relevance of GPC and
study concrete physical systems from that new viewpoint.
  In the first part of this thesis we review Klyachko's solution of the
univariate quantum marginal problem. In particular we break his abstract
derivation based on algebraic topology down to a more elementary level and
reveal the geometrical picture behind it.
  The second part explores the possible physical relevance of GPC. We review
the effect of pinning, i.e. the saturation of some GPC by given natural
occupation numbers and explain its consequences. Although this effect would be
quite spectacular we argue that pinning is unnatural. Instead, we conjecture
the effect of quasipinning, defined by occupation numbers close to (but not
exactly on) the boundary of the allowed region.
  In the third part we study concrete fermionic quantum systems from the new
viewpoint of GPC. In particular, we compute the natural occupation numbers for
the ground state of a family of interacting fermions in a harmonic potential.
Intriguingly, we find that the occupation numbers are strongly quasipinned,
even up to medium interaction strengths. We identify this as an effect of the
lowest few energy eigenstates, which provides first insights into the mechanism
behind quasipinning.

symmetric and which we conjecture to be sufficient. We apply these ideas to
extremal transitions and to understanding the way in which both Berglund-Hubsch

the enhanced electromagnetic (EM) fields found to be higher than the case of
NPs on a dielectric substrate. In the present work, it is shown that even much
higher enhancement of EM fields is obtained by exciting the LSPs through
extended surface plasmons (ESPs) generated at the metallic film surface using
the Kretschmann-Raether configuration. We show that the largest EM field
enhancement and the highest surface-enhanced fluorescence intensity are
obtained when the incidence angle is the ESP resonance angle of the underlying
metal film. The finite-difference time-domain simulations indicate that
excitation of LSPs using ESPs can generate 1-3 orders higher EM field intensity
than direct excitation of the LSPs using incidence from free space. The
ultrahigh enhancement is attributed to the strong confinement of the ESP waves
in the vertical direction. The drastically intensified EM fields are
significant for highly-sensitive refractive index sensing, surface-enhanced
spectroscopies, and enhancing the efficiency of optoelectronic devices.

influential users from a social network, such that by targeting them as early
adopters, the expected total adoption through influence cascades over the
network is maximized. However, almost all prior work focuses on cascades of a
single propagating entity or purely-competitive entities. In this work, we
propose the Comparative Independent Cascade (Com-IC) model that covers the full
spectrum of entity interactions from competition to complementarity. In Com-IC,
users' adoption decisions depend not only on edge-level information
propagation, but also on a node-level automaton whose behavior is governed by a
set of model parameters, enabling our model to capture not only competition,
but also complementarity, to any possible degree. We study two natural
optimization problems, Self Influence Maximization and Complementary Influence
Maximization, in a novel setting with complementary entities. Both problems are
NP-hard, and we devise efficient and effective approximation algorithms via
non-trivial techniques based on reverse-reachable sets and a novel ""sandwich
approximation"". The applicability of both techniques extends beyond our model
and problems. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithms consistently
outperform intuitive baselines in four real-world social networks, often by a
significant margin. In addition, we learn model parameters from real user

exact frequency power law attenuation and empirically measured attenuation of a
variety of tissues that does not fit an exact power law. A computational
technique based on artificial relaxation is included to correct the

the more-difficult part of the constraint algebra. The Abelianized constraints
can then easily be quantized or modified by putative quantum effects. As
pointed out here, however, the method does not automatically provide a
covariant quantization, defined as an anomaly-free quantum theory with a
classical limit in which the usual (off-shell) gauge structure of hypersurface

quark-antiquark pairs and (n-2k) gluons, are taken in the (n-2)!/k! Melia
basis, and are independent under the color-algebra Kleiss-Kuijf relations. This
generalizes the color decomposition of Del Duca, Dixon, and Maltoni to an
arbitrary number of quarks. The color coefficients in the new decomposition are
given by compact expressions valid for arbitrary gauge group and

calculations that color-kinematics duality holds for amplitudes with general

questioning the applicability of the local [CII]-SFR relation to high-z
systems. To investigate this issue we use the Vallini et al. 2013 (V13) model,
based on high-resolution, radiative transfer cosmological simulations to
predict the [CII] emission from the interstellar medium of a z~7 (halo mass
$M_h=1.17\times10^{11}M_{\odot}$) galaxy. We improve the V13 model by including
(a) a physically-motivated metallicity (Z) distribution of the gas, (b) the
contribution of Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs), (c) the effects of Cosmic
Microwave Background on the [CII] line luminosity. We study the relative
contribution of diffuse neutral gas to the total [CII] emission ($F
_{diff}/F_{tot}$) for different SFR and Z values. We find that the [CII]
emission arises predominantly from PDRs: regardless of the galaxy properties,
$F _{diff}/F_{tot}\leq 10$% since, at these early epochs, the CMB temperature
approaches the spin temperature of the [CII] transition in the cold neutral
medium ($T_{CMB}\sim T_s^{CNM}\sim 20$ K). Our model predicts a high-z
[CII]-SFR relation consistent with observations of local dwarf galaxies
($0.02<Z/Z_{\odot}<0.5$). The [CII] deficit suggested by actual data
($L_{CII}<2.0\times 10^7 L_{\odot}$ in BDF3299 at z~7.1) if confirmed by deeper
ALMA observations, can be ascribed to negative stellar feedback disrupting
molecular clouds around star formation sites. The deviation from the local
[CII]-SFR would then imply a modified Kennicutt-Schmidt relation in z>6
galaxies. Alternatively/in addition, the deficit might be explained by low gas
metallicities ($Z<0.1 Z_{\odot}$).

of the most powerful sources peaks at higher redshift than that of their weaker
counterparts. This paper establishes whether this luminosity-dependent
evolution persists for sources an order of magnitude fainter than those
previously studied, by measuring the steep--spectrum radio luminosity function
(RLF) across the range $10^{24} < P_{\rm 1.4 GHz} < 10^{28}$ W/Hz, out to high
redshift. A grid-based modelling method is used, in which no assumptions are
made about the RLF shape and high-redshift behaviour. The inputs to the model
are the same as in Rigby et al. (2011): redshift distributions from radio
source samples, together with source counts and determinations of the local
luminosity function. However, to improve coverage of the radio power vs.
redshift plane at the lowest radio powers, a new faint radio sample is
introduced. This covers 0.8 sq. deg., in the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field, to a
1.4 GHz flux density limit of $S_{\rm 1.4 GHz} \geq 100~\mu$Jy, with 99%
redshift completeness. The modelling results show that the previously seen
high-redshift declines in space density persist to $P_{\rm 1.4 GHz} < 10^{25}$
W/Hz. At $P_{\rm 1.4 GHz} > 10^{26}$ W/Hz the redshift of the peak space
density increases with luminosity, whilst at lower radio luminosities the
position of the peak remains constant within the uncertainties. This `cosmic
downsizing' behaviour is found to be similar to that seen at optical
wavelengths for quasars, and is interpreted as representing the transition from
radiatively efficient to inefficient accretion modes in the steep-spectrum
population. This conclusion is supported by constructing simple models for the
space density evolution of these two different radio galaxy classes; these are
able to successfully reproduce the observed variation in peak redshift.

differences. The maximum blueshift of the H-alpha-emitting gas is ~290 km/s,

distinguished from an atomic insulator in that it exhibits entanglement which
is protected by its spatial symmetries. These properties are encoded in a model
many-body wavefunction that describes a fully symmetric insulator of bosons on
the honeycomb lattice at half filling per site. While the resulting integer
unit cell filling allows the state to bypass `no-go' theorems that trigger
fractionalization at fractional filling, it nevertheless has nontrivial
entanglement, protected by symmetry. We demonstrate this by computing the
boundary entanglement spectra, finding a gapless entanglement edge described by
a conformal field theory as well as degeneracies protected by the non-trivial
action of combined charge-conservation and spatial symmetries on the edge.
Here, the tight-binding representation of the space group symmetries plays a
particular role in allowing certain entanglement cuts that are not allowed on
other lattices of the same symmetry, suggesting that the lattice representation
can serve as an additional symmetry ingredient in protecting an interacting
topological phase. Our results extend to a related insulating state of

Seijen and Sutton, 2014) as a universal replacement for the popular
TD({\lambda}) algorithm, in temporal-difference learning and reinforcement
learning. True online TD({\lambda}) has better theoretical properties than
conventional TD({\lambda}), and the expectation is that it also results in
faster learning. In this paper, we put this hypothesis to the test.
Specifically, we compare the performance of true online TD({\lambda}) with that
of TD({\lambda}) on challenging examples, random Markov reward processes, and a
real-world myoelectric prosthetic arm. We use linear function approximation
with tabular, binary, and non-binary features. We assess the algorithms along
three dimensions: computational cost, learning speed, and ease of use. Our
results confirm the strength of true online TD({\lambda}): 1) for sparse
feature vectors, the computational overhead with respect to TD({\lambda}) is
minimal; for non-sparse features the computation time is at most twice that of
TD({\lambda}), 2) across all domains/representations the learning speed of true
online TD({\lambda}) is often better, but never worse than that of
TD({\lambda}), and 3) true online TD({\lambda}) is easier to use, because it
does not require choosing between trace types, and it is generally more stable
with respect to the step-size. Overall, our results suggest that true online
TD({\lambda}) should be the first choice when looking for an efficient,
general-purpose TD method.

phase associated with photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) at the cloud surfaces,

scaling both with local star formation rate (SFR) volume density, we calculate
the [CII] emission using a photon escape probability formalism. The [CII]
emission peaks in the central $\lesssim$1 kpc of our galaxies as do the SFR
radial profiles, with most [CII] ($\gtrsim$70%) originating in the molecular
gas phase, whereas further out ($\gtrsim$2 kpc), the atomic/PDR gas dominates
($\gtrsim$90%) the [CII] emission, no longer tracing on-going star formation.

spatially resolved (on scales of 1 kpc), delineated by our simulated galaxies

challenges include data sparsity at high resolutions and the need to respect
complex urban spatial domains. To provide spatial density predictions for
ambulance demand in Melbourne, Australia as it varies over hourly intervals, we
propose a predictive spatio-temporal kernel warping method. To predict for each
hour, we build a kernel density estimator on a sparse set of the most similar

a larger set of past data irregardless of time periods (point cloud). The point
cloud represents the spatial structure and geographical characteristics of
Melbourne, including complex boundaries, road networks, and neighborhoods.
Borrowing from manifold learning, kernel warping is performed through a graph
Laplacian of the point cloud and can be interpreted as a regularization
towards, and a prior imposed, for spatial features. Kernel bandwidth and degree
of warping are efficiently estimated via cross-validation, and can be made
time- and/or location-specific. Our proposed model gives significantly more
accurate predictions compared to a current industry practice, an unwarped
kernel density estimation, and a time-varying Gaussian mixture model.

apparent how the statistical dependence between age and survival is directly
related to either the age-dependence of the loss function or the survival-time

density in a minimal, valence-only electron basis set. The minimal-basis
approximation causes molecular polarization to be underestimated, and hence
intermolecular interaction energies are also underestimated, especially for
intermolecular interactions involving charged species. In this work, the
third-order self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding method
(DFTB3) is augmented with an auxiliary response density using the
chemical-potential equalization (CPE) method and an empirical dispersion
correction (D3). The parameters in the CPE and D3 models are fitted to
high-level CCSD(T) reference interaction energies for a broad range of chemical
species, as well as dipole moments calculated at the DFT level; the impact of
including polarizabilities of molecules in the parameterization is also
considered. Parameters for the elements H, C, N, O and S are presented. The
RMSD interaction energy is improved from 6.07 kcal/mol to 1.49 kcal/mol for
interactions with one charged specie, whereas the RMSD is improved from 5.60
kcal/mol to 1.73 for a set of 9 salt bridges, compared to uncorrected DFTB3.
For large water clusters and complexes that are dominated by dispersion
interactions, the already satisfactory performance of the DFTB3-D3 model is
retained; polarizabilities of neutral molecules are also notably improved.
Overall, the CPE extension of DFTB3-D3 provides a more balanced description of
different types of non-covalent interactions than NDDO type of semi-empirical
methods (e.g., PM6-D3H4) and PBE-D3 with modest basis sets.

walking-Technicolor candidate. We simulate the lattice version of this model at
finite temperatures near to the chiral-symmetry restoration transition, to
determine whether it is indeed a walking theory (QCD-like with a running
coupling which evolves slowly over an appreciable range of length scales) or if
it has an infrared fixed point, making it a conformal field theory. The lattice
spacing at this transition is decreased towards zero by increasing the number
$N_t$ of lattice sites in the temporal direction. Our simulations are performed
at $N_t=4,6,8,12$, on lattices with spatial extent much larger than the
temporal extent. A range of small fermion masses is chosen to make predictions
for the chiral (zero mass) limit. We find that the bare lattice coupling does
decrease as the lattice spacing is decreased. However, it decreases more slowly
than would be predicted by asymptotic freedom. We discuss whether this means
that the coupling is approaching a finite value as lattice $N_t$ is increased
-- the conformal option, or if the apparent disagreement with the scaling
predicted by asymptotic freedom is because the lattice coupling is a poor
expansion parameter, and the theory walks. Currently, evidence favours QCD with
2 colour-sextet quarks being a conformal field theory. Other potential sources
of disagreement with the walking hypothesis are also discussed.
  We also report an estimate of the position of the deconfinement transition
for $N_t=12$, needed for choosing parameters for zero-temperature simulations.

well-known theorem of Burnside. Next, for a given $n > 1$, we characterize all

the only irreducible subalgebra of itself. In fact, for a subfield $F$ of the

competition in wireless industry brings about spectrum scarcity and bandwidth
fragmentation. This inevitably results in asymmetric-valued LTE spectrum
allocation that stems from different timing for twice improvement in capacity
between competing operators, given spectrum allocations today. This motivates
us to study the economic effects of asymmetric-valued LTE spectrum allocation.
In this paper, we formulate the interactions between operators and users as a
hierarchical dynamic game framework, where two spiteful operators
simultaneously make spectrum acquisition decisions in the upper-level
first-price sealed-bid auction game, and dynamic pricing decisions in the
lower-level differential game, taking into account user subscription dynamics.
Using backward induction, we derive the equilibrium of the entire game under
mild conditions. Through analytical and numerical results, we verify our
studies by comparing the latest result of LTE spectrum auction in South Korea,
which serves as the benchmark of asymmetric-valued LTE spectrum auction

paper is concerned with studying the time-asymptotic behavior of the extended
contact processes on static, undirected, finite-size networks. This is a
contact process with nonzero exogenous infection rate (also known as the
{\epsilon}-SIS, {\epsilon} susceptible-infected-susceptible, model [1]). The
only known analytical characterization of the equilibrium distribution of this
process is for complete networks. For large networks with arbitrary topology,
it is infeasible to numerically solve for the equilibrium distribution since it
requires solving the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem of a matrix that is
exponential in N , the size of the network. We show that, for a certain range
of the network process parameters, the equilibrium distribution of the extended
contact process on arbitrary, finite-size networks is well approximated by the
equilibrium distribution of the scaled SIS process, which we derived in
closed-form in prior work. We confirm this result with numerical simulations
comparing the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process with
that of a scaled SIS process. We use this approximation to decide, in
polynomial-time, which agents and network substructures are more susceptible to
infection by the extended contact process.

evolutionary biology. This question is particularly intriguing in the case
where selective forces act in opposing directions at two population scales. For
example, a fast-replicating virus strain outcompetes slower-replicating strains
at the within-host scale. However, if the fast-replicating strain causes host
morbidity and is less frequently transmitted, it can be outcompeted by
slower-replicating strains at the between-host scale. Here we consider a
stochastic ball-and-urn process which models this type of phenomenon. We prove
the weak convergence of this process under two natural scalings. The first
scaling leads to a deterministic nonlinear integro-partial differential
equation on the interval $[0,1]$ with dependence on a single parameter,
$\lambda$. We show that the fixed points of this differential equation are Beta
distributions and that their stability depends on $\lambda$ and the behavior of
the initial data around $1$. The second scaling leads to a measure-valued
Fleming-Viot process, an infinite dimensional stochastic process that is
frequently associated with a population genetics.

to as Byzantines - is hindered by the necessity of exactly knowing the
statistical behavior of Byzantines. By focusing on a simple, yet widely
studied, set-up in which a Fusion Center (FC) is asked to make a binary
decision about a sequence of system states by relying on the possibly corrupted
decisions provided by local nodes, we propose a game-theoretic framework which
permits to exploit the superior performance provided by optimum decision
fusion, while limiting the amount of a-priori knowledge required. We first
derive the optimum decision strategy by assuming that the statistical behavior
of the Byzantines is known. Then we relax such an assumption by casting the
problem into a game-theoretic framework in which the FC tries to guess the
behavior of the Byzantines, which, in turn, must fix their corruption strategy
without knowing the guess made by the FC. We use numerical simulations to
derive the equilibrium of the game, thus identifying the optimum behavior for
both the FC and the Byzantines, and to evaluate the achievable performance at
the equilibrium. We analyze several different setups, showing that in all cases
the proposed solution permits to improve the accuracy of data fusion. We also
show that, in some instances, it is preferable for the Byzantines to minimize
the mutual information between the status of the observed system and the
reports submitted to the FC, rather than always flipping the decision made by
the local nodes as it is customarily assumed in previous works.

employs a post-Newtonian (PN) accurate precessional equation, appropriate for
the PN accurate orbital angular momentum ${\bf L}$, to evolve the ${\bf L_{\rm

quantum algorithms, mainly in the query model. For any decision problem, there
exists a span program that leads to an algorithm with optimal quantum query
complexity, but finding such an algorithm is generally challenging.
  We consider new ways of designing quantum algorithms using span programs. We
show how any span program that decides a problem $f$ can also be used to decide
""property testing"" versions of $f$, or more generally, approximate the span
program witness size, a property of the input related to $f$. For example,
using our techniques, the span program for OR, which can be used to design an
optimal algorithm for the OR function, can also be used to design optimal
algorithms for: threshold functions, in which we want to decide if the Hamming
weight of a string is above a threshold or far below, given the promise that
one of these is true; and approximate counting, in which we want to estimate
the Hamming weight of the input. We achieve these results by relaxing the
requirement that 1-inputs hit some target exactly in the span program, which
could make design of span programs easier.
  We also give an exposition of span program structure, which increases the
understanding of this important model. One implication is alternative
algorithms for estimating the witness size when the phase gap of a certain
unitary can be lower bounded. We show how to lower bound this phase gap in some
cases.
  As applications, we give the first upper bounds in the adjacency query model
on the quantum time complexity of estimating the effective resistance between
$s$ and $t$, $R_{s,t}(G)$, of $\tilde
O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{3/2}}n\sqrt{R_{s,t}(G)})$, and, when $\mu$ is a lower
bound on $\lambda_2(G)$, by our phase gap lower bound, we can obtain $\tilde

regularized score matching method we propose applies to settings with

setting, regularized score matching avoids issues of asymmetry that arise when
applying the technique of neighborhood selection, and compared to existing
methods that directly yield symmetric estimates, the score matching approach
has the advantage that the considered loss is quadratic and gives piecewise
linear solution paths under $\ell_1$ regularization. Under suitable
irrepresentability conditions, we show that $\ell_1$-regularized score matching
is consistent for graph estimation in sparse high-dimensional settings. Through
numerical experiments and an application to RNAseq data, we confirm that

constructing and examining a mesonic model including pion, rho meson, and omega

model, the physical scalar mesons are defined as mixing states of the two- and
four-quark fields. We first omit the four-quark scalar meson field from the
model and find that when there is no direct coupling between the two-quark
scalar meson and the vector mesons, the soliton mass is smaller and the soliton
size is larger for lighter scalar mesons; when direct coupling is switched on,
as the coupling strength increases, the soliton becomes heavy, and the radius
of the baryon number density becomes large, as the repulsive force arising from
the $\omega$ meson becomes strong. We then include the four-quark scalar meson
field in the model and find that mixing between the two-quark and four-quark
components of the scalar meson fields also affects the properties of the
soliton. When the two-quark component of the lighter scalar meson is increased,
the soliton mass decreases and the soliton size increases.

Literature contains more sophisticated anonymization techniques, often based on
adding noise to the spatial data. However, these techniques either compromise
the privacy if the added noise is too little or the utility of the data if the
added noise is too strong. We investigate in this paper an alternative
solution, which builds on time distortion instead of spatial distortion.
Specifically, our contribution lies in (1) the introduction of the concept of
time distortion to anonymize mobility datasets (2) Promesse, a protection
mechanism implementing this concept (3) a practical study of Promesse compared
to two representative spatial distortion mechanisms, namely Wait For Me, which
enforces k-anonymity, and Geo-Indistinguishability, which enforces differential

Our results show that time distortion reduces the number of points of interest
that can be retrieved by an adversary to under 3 %, while the introduced
spatial error is almost null and the distortion introduced on the results of
range queries is kept under 13 % on average.

total number of occupied bonds is fixed, so that the canonical ensemble
applies. We derive that, in the limit $L \rightarrow \infty$, the critical

universal, for systems with $2y_t - d > 0$ where $y_t = 1/\nu$ is the thermal

modifications apply to other dimensionless quantities, such as Binder ratios.
For systems with $2y_t-d \le 0$, these quantities share same critical universal
values in the two ensembles. It is also derived that new finite-size

solved by BCE (Blocked Clause Elimination). To make the decomposition more
useful, one hopes to have the decomposition as unbalanced as possible. It is
often time consuming to achieve this goal. So far there have been several
decomposition and post-processing algorithms such as PureDecompose,
QuickDecompose, EagerMover etc. We found that these existing algorithms are
often either inefficient or low-quality decomposition. This paper aims at
improving the decomposition quality, while keeping the runtime of algorithms
under control. To achieve this goal, we improve the existing BCE, and present
two new variants of PureDecompose, a new heuristic decomposition called
LessInterfereDecompose, and a new post-processing algorithm called
RsetGuidedDecompose. Combining these new techniques results in a new algorithm
called MixDecompose. In our experiments, there is no application formula where
the quality of PureDecompose+EagerMover is better than MixDecompose. In terms
of speed, MixDecompose is also very fast. Our average runtime is a little
longer, but the worst-case runtime is shorter. In theory, our two variants of
PureDecompose requires linear time in the number of clauses. By limiting the

provided that which path information is erased, weak spin-state dependent light
scattering can be used to project two distant spins onto a maximally entangled
state upon detection of a single photon. Even though this approach is
necessarily probabilistic, successful generation of entanglement is heralded by
the photon detection event. Here, we demonstrate heralded quantum entanglement
of two quantum dot heavy-hole spins separated by 5 meters using single-photon
interference. Thanks to the long coherence time of hole spins and the efficient
spin-photon interface provided by self-assembled quantum dots embedded in leaky
microcavity structures, we generate 2300 entangled spin pairs per second, which
represents an improvement approaching three orders of magnitude as compared to
prior experiments. Delayed two-photon interference scheme we developed allows

taken at different angles. The term classical tomography is used, when the
imaging beam travels in straight lines through the object. This assumption is
valid for light with short wavelengths, for example in x-ray tomography. For
classical tomography, a commonly used reconstruction method is the filtered
back-projection algorithm which yields fast and stable object reconstructions.
In the context of single-cell imaging, the back-projection algorithm has been
used to investigate the cell structure or to quantify the refractive index
distribution within single cells using light from the visible spectrum.
Nevertheless, these approaches, commonly summarized as optical projection
tomography, do not take into account diffraction. Diffraction tomography with
the Rytov approximation resolves this issue. The explicit incorporation of the
wave nature of light results in an enhanced reconstruction of the object's
refractive index distribution. Here, we present a full literature review of
diffraction tomography. We derive the theory starting from the wave equation
and discuss its validity with the focus on applications for refractive index
tomography. Furthermore, we derive the back-propagation algorithm, the
diffraction-tomographic pendant to the back-projection algorithm, and describe
its implementation in three dimensions. Finally, we showcase the application of
the back-propagation algorithm to computer-generated scattering data. This
review unifies the different notations in literature and gives a detailed

baryon-to-photon ratio up to $\Delta \eta / \eta \sim 0.01 \div 1$ for decays
of the particles with masses 10 GeV $\div$ 1 TeV. However, such processes can
also be accompanied by emergence of an excessive gamma ray flux. The
observational data on the diffuse gamma ray background are used to making
constraints on the dark matter decay models and on the maximum possible

Detection of such variation of the baryon density in future cosmological

Namely, assuming each process proposes a value, each non-faulty process has to
decide a value such that each decided value was proposed, and no more than $k$
different values are decided. This is a hard problem in the sense that it
cannot be solved in asynchronous systems as soon as $k$ or more processes may
crash. One way to circumvent this impossibility consists in weakening its
termination property, requiring that a process terminates (decides) only if it
executes alone during a long enough period. This is the well-known
obstruction-freedom progress condition. Considering a system of $n$ {\it
anonymous asynchronous} processes, which communicate through atomic {\it
read/write registers only}, and where {\it any number of processes may crash},
this paper addresses and solves the challenging open problem of designing an
obstruction-free $k$-set agreement algorithm with $(n-k+1)$ atomic registers
only. From a shared memory cost point of view, this algorithm is the best
algorithm known so far, thereby establishing a new upper bound on the number of
registers needed to solve the problem (its gain is $(n-k)$ with respect to the
previous upper bound). The algorithm is then extended to address the repeated
version of $(n,k)$-set agreement. As it is optimal in the number of atomic
read/write registers, this algorithm closes the gap on previously established
lower/upper bounds for both the anonymous and non-anonymous versions of the
repeated $(n,k)$-set agreement problem. Finally, for $1 \leq x\leq k
\textless{} n$, a generalization suited to $x$-obstruction-freedom is also
described, which requires $(n-k+x)$ atomic registers only.

The large strain behaviour is investigated by tensile testing up to 60 % of

uniform magnetic field. The results show a multistable behaviour with a
transition from a bending-only deformed configuration for the 0$^\circ$ fibres
specimen, to a twisting only configuration, achieved for fibres at 90$^\circ$

preheating of unreacted mixture ahead of the flame results in a modest increase

considerable increase of the flame velocity in the case of a slow reactive
mixture. The effects of radiation preheating as stronger as smaller the normal

non-trivial intersection with the cone $\Nef(X)$ of numerically effective
divisors and cutting a facet of the pseudo-effective cone $\Eff(X)$, that is
$\Nef(X)\cap\partial\overline{\Eff}(X)\neq\{0\}$. In particular this means that
$X$ admits non-trivial and non-big numerically effective divisors.
Geometrically this guarantees the existence of a fiber type contraction
morphism over a smooth toric variety of dimension and Picard number lower than
those of $X$, so giving rise to a classification of smooth and complete toric
varieties with $r\leq 3$. Moreover we revise and improve results of Oda-Miyake
by exhibiting an extension of the above result to projective, toric, varieties
of dimension $n=3$ and Picard number $r=4$, allowing us to classifying all
these threefolds. We then improve results of Fujino-Sato, by presenting sharp
(counter)examples of smooth, projective, toric varieties of any dimension

is $\Nef(X)\cap\partial\overline{\Eff}(X)=\{0\}$. Producing those examples

essential. In this work, we apply low temperature time-resolved
photoluminescence (PL) measurements to investigate exciton valley relaxation
dynamics and, in particular, its behavior under strong excitation. At the
lowest excitation powers the inter valley scattering time is $\simeq 50$ ps,
but shortens by more than a factor of two at the highest powers. We attribute
this acceleration to either heating of the exciton system or the presence of a
dense exciton gas, which could influence the exciton valley properties.
Furthermore, we analyze the PL dynamics of excitons and trions. We find that
the PL decays for all peaks are bi-exponential and approximately independent of
the excitation power. We attribute the short decay to radiative recombination
and escape to a reservoir of dark states. The long decay is ascribed to a
transfer of excitons back from the reservoir. For the first time, we evaluate
the exciton PL decay time of $\simeq$ 10 ps. The latter process is
valley-conserving and occurs on a timescale of $\simeq$ 50 ps.

Penalty (MCP) or $\ell\_p$ pseudo norm with $p\textless{}1$. Two algorithms are
proposed, first an accelerated proximal approach for solving the convex
problems, second a reweighted $\ell\_1$ scheme to address the non-convex
regularizations. We conduct intensive experiments on nine datasets from Letor
3.0 and Letor 4.0 corpora. Numerical results show that the use of non-convex
regularizations we propose leads to more sparsity in the resulting models while
prediction performance is preserved. The number of features is decreased by up
to a factor of six compared to the $\ell\_1$ regularization. In addition, the

disruption of the Oort cloud using the classical impulse approximation. We
calculate the evolution of a planetesimal disk into a spherical Oort cloud due
to the perturbation from passing stars for 10 Gyr. We obtain the empirical fits
of the $e$-folding time for the number of Oort cloud comets using the standard
exponential and Kohlrausch formulae as functions of the stellar parameters and
the initial semimajor axes of planetesimals. The $e$-folding time and the
evolution timescales of the orbital elements are also analytically derived. In
some calculations, the effect of the Galactic tide is additionally considered.
We also show the radial variations of the $e$-folding times to the Oort cloud.
From these timescales, we show that if the initial planetesimal disk has the
semimajor axes distribution ${\rm d}n/{\rm d}a\propto a^{-2}$, which is
produced by planetary scattering (Higuchi et al. 2006), the $e$-folding time
for planetesimals in the Oort cloud is $\sim$10 Gyr at any heliocentric
distance $r$. This uniform $e$-folding time over the Oort cloud means that the
supply of comets from the inner Oort cloud to the outer Oort cloud is
sufficiently effective to keep the comet distribution as ${\rm d}n/{\rm

axes in the Oort cloud is approximately proportional to $a^{-2}$ for any

correctly, models built on a specific data space become more robust when

unsupervised optimal transportation model to perform the alignment of the
representations in the source and target domains. We learn a transportation
plan matching both PDFs, which constrains labelled samples in the source domain
to remain close during transport. This way, we exploit at the same time the few

spanner} of $G$ is a spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ such that distances in $H$
are stretched at most by an additive term $\beta$ w.r.t. the corresponding
distances in $G$. A natural research goal related with spanners is that of
designing \emph{sparse} spanners with \emph{low} stretch.
  In this paper, we focus on \emph{fault-tolerant} additive spanners, namely
additive spanners which are able to preserve their additive stretch even when
one edge fails. We are able to improve all known such spanners, in terms of
either sparsity or stretch. In particular, we consider the sparsest known
spanners with stretch $6$, $28$, and $38$, and reduce the stretch to $4$, $10$,
and $14$, respectively (while keeping the same sparsity).
  Our results are based on two different constructions. On one hand, we show
how to augment (by adding a \emph{small} number of edges) a fault-tolerant
additive \emph{sourcewise spanner} (that approximately preserves distances only
from a given set of source nodes) into one such spanner that preserves all
pairwise distances. On the other hand, we show how to augment some known
fault-tolerant additive spanners, based on clustering techniques. This way we
decrease the additive stretch without any asymptotic increase in their size. We
also obtain improved fault-tolerant additive spanners for the case of one
vertex failure, and for the case of $f$ edge failures.

compute discrete-time, finite-state Markov chains as formal abstractions of

two ways. First, we exploit the structure of the underlying Markov process to
compute the abstraction separately for each dimension. Second, we employ
dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) as compact representations of the abstraction.
In contrast, existing approaches represent and store the (exponentially large)
Markov chain explicitly, which leads to heavy memory requirements limiting the
application to models of dimension less than half, according to our
experiments. We show how to construct a DBN abstraction of a Markov process
satisfying an independence assumption on the driving process noise. We compute
a guaranteed bound on the error in the abstraction w.r.t.\ the probabilistic
invariance property; the dimension-dependent abstraction makes the error bounds
more precise than existing approaches. Additionally, we show how factor graphs
and the sum-product algorithm for DBNs can be used to solve the finite-horizon
probabilistic invariance problem. Together, DBN-based representations and
algorithms can be significantly more efficient than explicit representations of
Markov chains for abstracting and model checking structured Markov processes.

Direct numerical simulations of freely decaying MHD turbulence are performed
for different magnetogenesis scenarios: magnetic fields generated during cosmic

  Magnetic fields and fluid motions are strongly coupled due to the high
Reynolds number in the early universe. Hence, we abandon the simple adiabatic
dilution model to estimate magnetic field amplitudes in the expanding universe

evolution. Numerical simulations have been carried out for non-helical and
helical magnetic field configurations. The numerical results show the
possibility of inverse transfer of energy in magnetically dominated non-helical
MHD turbulence. On the other hand, decay properties of helical turbulence
depend on whether the turbulent magnetic field is in a weakly or a fully

underneath the membrane of eukaryotic cells. This network generates the forces
that drive cell and tissue-scale morphogenetic processes. The effective
material properties of this active network determine large-scale deformations
and other morphogenetic events. For example,the characteristic time of stress
relaxation (the Maxwell time)in the actomyosin sets the time scale of
large-scale deformation of the cortex. Similarly, the characteristic length of
stress propagation (the hydrodynamic length) sets the length scale of slow
deformations, and a large hydrodynamic length is a prerequisite for long-ranged
cortical flows. Here we introduce a method to determine physical parameters of
the actomyosin cortical layer (in vivo). For this we investigate the relaxation
dynamics of the cortex in response to laser ablation in the one-cell-stage {\it
C. elegans} embryo and in the gastrulating zebrafish embryo. These responses
can be interpreted using a coarse grained physical description of the cortex in
terms of a two dimensional thin film of an active viscoelastic gel. To
determine the Maxwell time, the hydrodynamic length and the ratio of active
stress and per-area friction, we evaluated the response to laser ablation in
two different ways: by quantifying flow and density fields as a function of
space and time, and by determining the time evolution of the shape of the
ablated region. Importantly, both methods provide best fit physical parameters
that are in close agreement with each other and that are similar to previous
estimates in the two systems. We provide an accurate and robust means for
measuring physical parameters of the actomyosin cortical layer.It can be useful
for investigations of actomyosin mechanics at the cellular-scale, but also for
providing insights in the active mechanics processes that govern tissue-scale
morphogenesis.

""3D graphene"" and a topological insulator by possessing pairs of Weyl points
(through which the electronic bands disperse linearly along all three momentum
directions) connected by topological surface states, forming the unique
""Fermi-arc"" type Fermi-surface (FS). Each Weyl point is chiral and contains
half of the degrees of freedom of a Dirac point, and can be viewed as a
magnetic monopole in the momentum space. Here, by performing angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy on non-centrosymmetric compound TaAs, we observed
its complete band structures including the unique ""Fermi-arc"" FS and linear
bulk band dispersion across the Weyl points, in excellent agreement with the
theoretical calculations. This discovery not only confirms TaAs as the first 3D
TWS, but also provides an ideal platform for realizing exotic physical

anomalous Hall effect) which may also lead to novel future applications.

network technologies and architectures, such as cellular networks, wireless
local area networks, sensor networks, and device to device communications.
Through cooperation between dissimilar wireless devices, this new combined
network topology promises to unlock ever larger data rates and provide truly
ubiquitous coverage for end users, as well as enabling higher spectral
efficiency. However, it also increases the risk of co-channel interference and
introduces the possibility of correlation in the aggregated interference that
not only impacts the communication performance, but also makes the associated
mathematical analysis much more complex. To address this problem and evaluate
the communication performance of cooperative relay networks, we adopt a
stochastic geometry based approach by assuming that the interfering nodes are
randomly distributed according to a Poisson point process (PPP). We also use a
random medium access protocol to counteract the effects of interference
correlation. Using this approach, we derive novel closed-form expressions for
the successful transmission probability and local delay of a relay network with
correlated interference. As well as this, we find the optimal transmission
probability $p$ that jointly maximizes the successful transmission probability
and minimizes the local delay. Finally numerical results are provided to
confirm that the proposed joint optimization strategy achieves a significant
performance gain compared to a conventional scheme.

rank-aware databases, discuss issues of the present approaches, and outline
generalizations of several types of classic division-like operations. We work
in a model which generalizes the Codd model of data by considering tuples in
relations annotated by ranks, indicating degrees to which tuples in relations
match queries. The approach utilizes complete residuated lattices as the basic
structures of degrees. We argue that unlike the classic model, relational
divisions are fundamental operations which cannot in general be expressed by
means of other operations. In addition, we compare the existing and proposed
operations and identify those which are faithful counterparts of universally
quantified queries formulated in relational calculi. We introduce Pseudo Tuple
Calculus in the ranked model which is further used to show mutual definability
of the various forms of divisions presented in the paper.

mode-locked semiconductor lasers and apply it to study the effect of delayed
coherent optical feedback on pulse timing jitter in these lasers. The proposed
method greatly reduces computation times and therefore allows for the
investigation of the dependence of timing fluctuations over greater parameter
domains. We show that resonant feedback leads to a reduction in the timing
jitter and that a frequency-pulling region forms about the main resonances,
within which a timing jitter reduction is observed. The width of these
frequency-pulling regions increases linearly with short feedback delay times.
We derive an analytic expression for the timing jitter, which predicts a
monotonous decrease in the timing jitter for resonant feedback of increasing
delay lengths, when timing jitter effects are fully separated from amplitude
jitter effects. For long feedback cavities the decrease in timing jitter scales
approximately as $1/\tau$ with the increase of the feedback delay time $\tau$.

principle of N. N. Bogoliubov for free energy in the context of its
applications to various problems of statistical mechanics and condensed matter
physics. The review presents a terse discussion of selected works carried out
over the past few decades on the theory of many-particle interacting systems in
terms of the variational inequalities. It is the purpose of this paper to
discuss some of the general principles which form the mathematical background
to this approach, and to establish a connection of the variational technique
with other methods, such as the method of the mean (or self-consistent) field
in the many-body problem, in which the effect of all the other particles on any
given particle is approximated by a single averaged effect, thus reducing a
many-body problem to a single-body problem. The method is illustrated by
applying it to various systems of many-particle interacting systems, such as
Ising and Heisenberg models, superconducting and superfluid systems, strongly
correlated systems, etc. It seems likely that these technical advances in the
many-body problem will be useful in suggesting new methods for treating and
understanding many-particle interacting systems. This work proposes a new,
general and pedagogical presentation, intended both for those who are

regularization techniques have been recently introduced in linear system
identification. In particular, all the adopted estimators solve a regularized
least squares problem, differing in the nature of the penalty term assigned to
the impulse response. Popular choices include atomic and nuclear norms (applied
to Hankel matrices) as well as norms induced by the so called stable spline
kernels. In this paper, a comparative study of estimators based on these
different types of regularizers is reported. Our findings reveal that stable
spline kernels outperform approaches based on atomic and nuclear norms since
they suitably embed information on impulse response stability and smoothness.
This point is illustrated using the Bayesian interpretation of regularization.
We also design a new class of regularizers defined by ""integral"" versions of
stable spline/TC kernels. Under quite realistic experimental conditions, the
new estimators outperform classical prediction error methods also when the
latter are equipped with an oracle for model order selection.

year since 2005. In the 2013 edition there were over 47,000 schools registered
involving nearly 19.2 million students. The Brazilian public educational system
is structured into three administrative levels: federal, state and municipal.
Students participating in the OBMEP come from three educational levels, two in
primary and one in secondary school. We aim at studying the performance of
Brazilian public schools which have been taking part of the OBMEP from 2006
until 2013. We propose a standardization of the mean scores of schools per year
and educational level which is modeled through a hierarchical dynamic beta
regression model. Both the mean and precision of the beta distribution are
modeled as a function of covariates whose effects evolve smoothly with time.
Results show that, regardless of the educational level, federal schools have
better performance than municipal or state schools. The mean performance of
schools increases with the human development index (HDI) of the municipality
the school is located in. Moreover, the difference in mean performance between
federal and state or municipal schools tends to increase with the HDI. Schools
with higher proportion of boys tend to have better mean performance in the

instead, massages the fault from the data. We assume that only one fault occurs
at any one time and model the signal by two separate non-parametric Gaussian
process models for both the physical phenomenon and the fault. In order to
facilitate fault removal we introduce the Markov Region Link kernel for
handling non-stationary Gaussian processes. This kernel is piece-wise

  Evolution",,,,,"cs.SY cs.AI cs.DC cs.LG cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cloud controllers aim at responding to application demands by automatically
scaling the compute resources at runtime to meet performance guarantees and
minimize resource costs. Existing cloud controllers often resort to scaling
strategies that are codified as a set of adaptation rules. However, for a cloud
provider, applications running on top of the cloud infrastructure are more or
less black-boxes, making it difficult at design time to define optimal or
pre-emptive adaptation rules. Thus, the burden of taking adaptation decisions
often is delegated to the cloud application. Yet, in most cases, application
developers in turn have limited knowledge of the cloud infrastructure. In this
paper, we propose learning adaptation rules during runtime. To this end, we
introduce FQL4KE, a self-learning fuzzy cloud controller. In particular, FQL4KE
learns and modifies fuzzy rules at runtime. The benefit is that for designing
cloud controllers, we do not have to rely solely on precise design-time
knowledge, which may be difficult to acquire. FQL4KE empowers users to specify
cloud controllers by simply adjusting weights representing priorities in system
goals instead of specifying complex adaptation rules. The applicability of
FQL4KE has been experimentally assessed as part of the cloud application
framework ElasticBench. The experimental results indicate that FQL4KE
outperforms our previously developed fuzzy controller without learning
mechanisms and the native Azure auto-scaling.

formulation, the loss of the angular momentum, $J$, is non-negligible in highly
spinning single black hole evolutions. This loss also appears, usually right
after the merger, in highly spinning binary black hole simulations, The loss of
$J$ may be attributed to some unclear numerical dissipation. Reducing
unphysical dissipation is expected to result in more stable and accurate
evolutions. In the previous work \cite{yhlc12} we proposed several
modifications which are able to prevent black hole evolutions from the
unphysical dissipation, and the resulting simulations are more stable than in
the traditional BSSN formulation. Specifically, these three modifications (M1,
M2, and M3) enhance the effects of stability, hyperbolicity, and dissipation of
the formulation. We experiment further in this work with these modifications,
and demonstrate that these modifications improve the accuracy and also
effectively suppress the loss of $J$, particularly in the black hole
simulations with the initially large ratio of $J$ and the square of the ADM
mass.

in the field geometry between a global MHD model and the potential field source
surface model (PFSSM) by tracing individual magnetic field lines in the MHD
model from the Alfven surface (AS), through the source surface (SS), all the
way to the field line footpoint, and then back to the source surface in the

AS along the same radial line. We study the effect of solar cycle variations,
the order of the potential field harmonic expansion, and different magnetogram
sources. We find that the flux-tube expansion factor is consistently smaller at
the AS than at the SS for solar minimum and the fast solar wind, but it is
consistently larger for solar maximum and the slow solar wind. We use the
Wang--Sheeley--Arge (WSA) model to calculate the associated wind speed for each

enhancements of physical devices through the use of advanced computational

cyber-physical systems and cloud-controlled devices are subject to numerous
design challenges; among them is that of security. In particular, recent
advances in adversary technology pose Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) which
may stealthily and completely compromise a cyber system. In this paper, we
design a framework for the security of cloud-based systems that specifies when
a device should trust commands from the cloud which may be compromised. This
interaction can be considered as a game between three players: a cloud
defender/administrator, an attacker, and a device. We use traditional signaling
games to model the interaction between the cloud and the device, and we use the
recently proposed FlipIt game to model the struggle between the defender and
attacker for control of the cloud. Because attacks upon the cloud can occur
without knowledge of the defender, we assume that strategies in both games are
picked according to prior commitment. This framework requires a new equilibrium
concept, which we call Gestalt Equilibrium, a fixed-point that expresses the
interdependence of the signaling and FlipIt games. We present the solution to
this fixed-point problem under certain parameter cases, and illustrate an
example application of cloud control of an unmanned vehicle. Our results
contribute to the growing understanding of cloud-controlled systems.

minimal possible black-hole entropy. In this way, the non-holographic AdS/CFT
correspondence offers a simple resolution of the black-hole information

invaluable information on the propagation of these particles in the Galaxy. In
the rigidity region around a few hundred GV, such features have been measured
in the proton and helium spectra by the PAMELA experiment and later confirmed
with a higher significance by AMS-02. We investigate the implications of these

self-generated waves.
  Aims: We show that the recent data on the spectrum of protons and helium
nuclei as collected with AMS-02 and Voyager are in very good agreement with the
predictions of a model in which the transport of Galactic CRs is regulated by
self-generated waves. We also study the implications of the scenario for the
boron-to-carbon ratio: although a good overall agreement is found, at high
energy we find marginal support for a (quasi) energy independent contribution
to the grammage, that we argue may come from the sources themselves
  Results: A break in the spectra of all nuclei is found at rigidity of a few
hundred GV, as a result of a transition from self-generated waves to
pre-existing waves with a Kolmogorov power spectrum. Neither the slope of the
diffusion coefficient, nor its normalisation are free parameters. Moreover, at
rigidities below a few GV, CRs are predicted to be advected with the
self-generated waves at the local Alfv\'en speed. This effect, predicted in our
previous work, provides an excellent fit to the Voyager data on the proton and
helium spectra at low energies, providing additional support to the model.

X-ray spectra in many cases contain cyclotron resonant scattering features
related to the magnetic field of the sources. Spectral variations as a function
of luminosity and of the rotational phase of the neutron star are observed in
many accreting pulsars. Aims: We explore X-ray spectral and timing properties
of the Be/X-ray binary GX 304-1 during an outburst episode. Specifically, we
investigate the behavior of the cyclotron resonant scattering feature, the
continuum spectral parameters, the pulse period, and the energy- and
luminosity-resolved pulse profiles. We combine the luminosity-resolved spectral
and timing analysis to probe the accretion geometry and the beaming patterns of
the rotating neutron star. Methods: We analyze the INTEGRAL data from the two
JEM-X modules, ISGRI and SPI, covering the January-February 2012 outburst,
divided in six observations. We obtain pulse profiles in two energy bands,
phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra for each observation. Results: We
confirm the positive luminosity-dependence of the cyclotron line energy in GX
304-1, and report a dependence of the photon index on luminosity. Using a
pulse-phase connection technique, we find a pulse period solution valid for the
entire outburst. Our pulse-phase resolved analysis shows, that the centroid
energy of the cyclotron line is varying only slightly with pulse phase, while
other spectral parameters show more pronounced variations. Our results are
consistent with a scenario in which, as the pulsar rotates, we are exploring
only a small portion of its beam pattern.

evaluating an observable function along the orbits of the system and study

quantity intended to measure the severity of the exceedance. In particular, we

adding the largest excesses in a cluster of exceedances (POT). We provide

decay of correlations of the system. Moreover, we prove that the convergence of
the marked point processes for a `nice' first return induced map can be carried
to the original system. The systems considered include non-uniformly expanding
maps (in one or higher dimensions), maps with intermittent fixed points or

fields, each described by the Unruh-Wald model. It is demonstrated that because
of the Unruh effect, the bipartite entanglement of the two qubits suddenly dies
when the acceleration of one or more qubits are large enough. We also consider
three entangled accelerating qubits in GHZ state and in W state, with equal
acceleration-frequency ratio, and found that in either state, the tripartite
entanglement suddenly dies at a certain value of acceleration-frequency ratio.
The equivalence between the Rindler metric and the Schwarzchild metric in the
vicinity of the horizon of a black hole implies that for the two entangled
qubits outside a black hole, the entanglement suddenly dies when one or both of
the qubits are close enough to the horizon, while for the three entangled
qubits in GHZ or W state, the tripartite entanglement suddenly dies when these
qubits are close enough to the horizon.

operation $\oplus$ and provides additional informations to the work started in
\cite{Ba1} and \cite{Ba2}. It is shown that any internal law of group metric
invariant (even quasigroup) can be considered as an inf-convolution.
Consequently, the operation of the inf-convolution of functions on a group
metric invariant is in reality an extension of the internal law of $X$ to
spaces of functions on $X$. We give an example of monoid $(S(X),\oplus)$ for
the inf-convolution structure, (which is dense in the set of all $1$-Lipschitz
bounded from bellow functions) for which, the map $\arg\min : (S(X),\oplus)
\rightarrow (X,.)$ is a (single valued) monoid morphism. It is also proved
that, given a group complete metric invariant $(X,d)$, the complete metric
space $(\mathcal{K}(X),d_{\infty})$ of all Katetov maps from $X$ to $\R$
equiped with the inf-convolution has a natural monoid structure which provides
the following fact: the group of all isometric automorphisms
$Aut_{Iso}(\mathcal{K}(X))$ of the monoid $\mathcal{K}(X)$, is isomorphic to
the group of all isometric automorphisms $Aut_{Iso}(X)$ of the group $X$. On
the other hand, we prove that the subset $\mathcal{K}_C(X)$ of $\mathcal{K}(X)$
of convex functions on a Banach space $X$, can be endowed with a convex cone
structure in which $X$ embeds isometrically as Banach space.

uniform variant of the Channel Assignment problem and show that this problem is
fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity
together with the largest weight. Consequently, every $L(p_1, p_2, \dots,
p_k)$-labeling problem is FPT when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity,
the maximum $p_i$ and $k.$
  Our results yield also FPT algorithms for all $L(p_1, p_2, \dots,
p_k)$-labeling problems when parameterized by the size of a minimum vertex
cover, answering an open question of Fiala et al.: Parameterized complexity of
coloring problems: Treewidth versus vertex cover. The same consequence applies
on Channel Assignment when the maximum weight is additionally included among
the parameters.
  Finally, we show that the uniform variant of the Channel Assignment problem
becomes NP-complete when generalized to graphs of bounded clique width.

(PD) black hole, which includes the Kerr-Newman rotating black hole and the
Taub-NUT spacetime. The main feature of this black hole is that it has 4
horizons like event horizon, Cauchy horizon and two accelerating horizons. In
the non-extremal case, the surface area, entropy, surface gravity, temperature,
angular velocity, Komar energy and irreducible mass on the event horizon and
Cauchy horizon are presented for PD black hole. The entropy product,
temperature product, Komar energy product and irreducible mass product are
found for event horizon and Cauchy horizon. Also their sums are also found for
both horizons. All these relations are found to be depend on mass of the PD
black hole and other parameters. So all the products are not universal for PD
black hole. The entropy and area bounds for two horizons are investigated. Also
we found the Christodoulou-Ruffini mass for extremal PD black hole. Finally,
using first law of thermodynamics, we also found the Smarr relation for PD
black hole.

structures, $\dot{\mathbf{z}}=K(\mathbf{z})DS(\mathbf{z})$, where the variable
$\mathbf{z}$ of interest evolves towards the maximum of a functional $S$
according to a metric defined by an operator $K$. While the functional often
follows immediately from physical considerations (e.g., the thermodynamic
entropy), the operator $K$ and the associated geometry does not necessarily so
(e.g., Wasserstein geometry for diffusion). In this paper, we present a
variational statement in the sense of maximum entropy production that directly
delivers a relationship between the operator $K$ and the constraints of the
system. In particular, the Wasserstein metric naturally arises here from the
conservation of mass or energy, and depends on the Onsager resistivity tensor,
which, itself, may be understood as another metric, as in the Steepest Entropy
Ascent formalism. This new variational principle is exemplified here for the
simultaneous evolution of conserved and non-conserved quantities in open
systems. It thus extends the classical Onsager flux-force relationships and the
associated variational statement to variables that do not have a flux
associated to them. We further show that the metric structure $K$ is intimately
linked to the celebrated Freidlin-Wentzell theory of stochastically perturbed
gradient flows, and that the proposed variational principle encloses an
infinite-dimensional fluctuation-dissipation statement.

carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an accurate understanding of the
thermodynamic behaviour of carbon dioxide and relevant impurities during the
pipeline transport stage. In this article we develop a general framework for
deriving pressure-explicit EoS for impure CO2. This flexible framework
facilitates ongoing development of custom EoS in response to new data and
computational applications. We use our method to generalise a recent EoS for
pure CO2 [Demetriades et al. Proc IMechE Part E, 227 (2013) pp. 117] to binary
mixtures with N2, O2 and H2, obtaining model parameters by fitting to
experiments made under conditions relevant to CCS-pipeline transport. Our model
pertains to pressures up to 16MPa and temperatures between 273K and the
critical temperature of pure CO2. In this region, we achieve close agreement
with experimental data. When compared to the GERG EoS, our EoS has a comparable
level of agreement with CO2 -N2 VLE experiments and demonstrably superior
agreement with the O2 and H2 VLE data. Finally, we discuss future options to
improve the calibration of EoS and to deal with the sparsity of data for some
impurities.

theory. The link between the water-bag formalism and fluid models that involve
density, fluid velocity, pressure and higher moments is established by
introducing suitable thermodynamic variables. The cases of one, two and three
water-bags are treated and their Hamiltonian structures are provided. In each
case, we give the associated fluid closures and we discuss their Casimir
invariants. We show how the method can be extended to an arbitrary number of

thermodynamic interpretation of the resulting models is discussed. Finally, a

black hole information transfer limits a space-time entropy-action equivalence
is proposed as a generalization of the holographic principle. With this
conjecture, the action principle can be replaced by the second law of
thermodynamics, and for the Einstein-Hilbert action the Einstein field
equations are conceptually the result of thermodynamic equilibrium. For
non-equilibrium situations Jaynes' information-theoretic approach to maximum
entropy production is adopted instead of the second law of thermodynamics. As
it turns out, for appropriate choices of constants quantum gravity is obtained.
For the special case of a free particle the Bekenstein-Verlinde
entropy-to-displacement relation of holographic gravity, and thus the
traditional holographic principle, emerges. Although Jacobson's original
thermodynamic equilibrium approach proposed that gravity might not necessarily
be quantized, this particular non-equilibrium treatment might require it.
