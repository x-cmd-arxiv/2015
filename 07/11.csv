between the channel estimation and data decoding stages. The receiver
incorporates sparsity-based parametric channel estimation. State-of-the-art
sparsity-based iterative receivers simplify the channel estimation problem by
restricting the multipath delays to a grid. Our receiver does not impose such a
restriction. As a result it does not suffer from the leakage effect, which
destroys sparsity. Communication at near capacity rates in high SNR requires a
large modulation order. Due to the close proximity of modulation symbols in
such systems, the grid-based approximation is of insufficient accuracy. We show
numerically that a state-of-the-art iterative receiver with grid-based sparse
channel estimation exhibits a bit-error-rate floor in the high SNR regime. On
the contrary, our receiver performs very close to the perfect channel state
information bound for all SNR values. We also demonstrate both theoretically
and numerically that parametric channel estimation works well in dense
channels, i.e., when the number of multipath components is large and each
individual component cannot be resolved.

NP-hard. Previously, this problem was conjectured to be in P, just as for the
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. Our result establishes in a formal way that
Kronecker coefficients are more difficult than Littlewood-Richardson
coefficients, unless P=NP.
  We also show that there exists a #P-formula for a particular subclass of
Kronecker coefficients whose positivity is NP-hard to decide. This is an
evidence that, despite the hardness of the positivity problem, there may well
exist a positive combinatorial formula for the Kronecker coefficients. Finding
such a formula is a major open problem in representation theory and algebraic
combinatorics.
  Finally, we consider the existence of the partition triples $(\lambda, \mu,
\pi)$ such that the Kronecker coefficient $k^\lambda_{\mu, \pi} = 0$ but the
Kronecker coefficient $k^{l \lambda}_{l \mu, l \pi} > 0$ for some integer
$l>1$. Such ""holes"" are of great interest as they witness the failure of the
saturation property for the Kronecker coefficients, which is still poorly
understood. Using insight from computational complexity theory, we turn our
hardness proof into a positive result: We show that not only do there exist
many such triples, but they can also be found efficiently. Specifically, we
show that, for any $0<\epsilon\leq1$, there exists $0<a<1$ such that, for all
$m$, there exist $\Omega(2^{m^a})$ partition triples $(\lambda,\mu,\mu)$ in the
Kronecker cone such that: (a) the Kronecker coefficient $k^\lambda_{\mu,\mu}$

each star, together with appropriate estimates of their uncertainties and
correlations. This requires at least five distinct observations per star. In
the early data reductions the number of observations may be insufficient for a
five-parameter solution, and even after the full mission many stars will remain
under-observed, including faint stars at the detection limit and transient
objects. In such cases it is reasonable to determine only the two position
parameters. Their formal uncertainties would however grossly underestimate the
actual errors, due to the neglected parallax and proper motion. We aim to
develop a recipe to calculate sensible formal uncertainties that can be used in
all cases of under-observed stars. Prior information about the typical ranges
of stellar parallaxes and proper motions is incorporated in the astrometric
solution by means of Bayes' rule. Numerical simulations based on the Gaia
Universe Model Snapshot (GUMS) are used to investigate how the prior influences
the actual errors and formal uncertainties when different amounts of Gaia
observations are available. We develop a criterion for the optimum choice of
priors, apply it to a wide range of cases, and derive a global approximation of
the optimum prior as a function of magnitude and galactic coordinates. The
feasibility of the Bayesian approach is demonstrated through global astrometric
solutions of simulated Gaia observations. With an appropriate prior it is
possible to derive sensible positions with realistic error estimates for any
number of available observations. Even though this recipe works also for
well-observed stars it should not be used where a good five-parameter
astrometric solution can be obtained without a prior. Parallaxes and proper
motions from a solution using priors are always biased and should not be used.

operators in scalar theories that break symmetries at scales close to their
ultraviolet completion cutoff, include terms that favour the breaking of
translation (Lorentz) invariance, potentially resulting in striped, chequered
board or general crystal-like phases. Such descriptions can be thought of as
the effective low energy description of QCD-like gauge theories near their
strong coupling scale where terms involving higher dimension operators are
generated. Our low energy theory consists of scalar fields describing operators
such as $\bar{q} q$ and $\bar{q} F^{(2n)} q$. Such scalars can have kinetic
mixing terms that generate effective momentum dependent contributions to the
mass matrix. We show that these can destabilize the translationally invariant
vacuum. It is possible that in some real gauge theory such operators could
become sufficiently dominant to realize such phases and it would be interesting
to look for them in lattice simulations. We present a holographic model of the
same phenomena which includes RG running. A key phenomenological motive to look
at such states is recent work that shows that the non-linear response in $R^2$
gravity to such short range fluctuations can mimic a cosmological constant.
Intriguingly in a cosmology with such a Starobinsky inflation term, to generate
the observed value of the present day acceleration would require stripes at the
electroweak scale. Unfortunately, low energy phenomenological constraints on
Lorentz violation in the electron-photon system appear to strongly rule out any
such possibility outside of a disconnected dark sector.

micron and a 5sigma selection criteria were used to select our initial sample.
Further manual inspection reduced our final catalog to 156 known and 119 YSO
candidate. The spatial distribution of newly found YSOs all over the field
shows an older generation of star formation which most of its massive members
have evolved into main sequence stars. In contrast, the majority of younger
members lie within the Perseus molecular cloud and currently active star
forming clusters such as NGC1333 and IC348. We also identified additional 66
point sources which passed YSO selection criteria but are likely AGB stars.
However their spatial distribution suggests that they may contain a fraction of
the YSOs. Comparing our results with the commonly used color-color selections,
we found that while color selection method fails in picking up bright but
evolved weak disks, our SED fitting method can identify such sources, including
transitional disks. In addition we have less contamination with background
sources such as galaxies, but in a price of loosing fainter (Jmag > 12) YSOs.
Finally we employed a Bayesian Monte Carlo SED fitting method to determine the
characteristics of each YSO candidate. Distribution of SED slopes and model
driven age and mass confirms separated YSO populations with suggested three age
groups of younger than 1 Myr old, 1-5 Myr old, and older than 5 Myrs which
agrees with the age of Per OB2 association and currently star forming sites

radius at which the ionisation front should stop expanding (""stall""). If this

will be trapped by the cloud. This effect is more severe in collapsing clouds

dramatically over time, with much larger photon emission rates needed for the
HII region to escape a collapsing cloud. We also measure the response of Jeans
unstable gas to the HII regions to predict the impact of UV radiation on star

possible to address steady state properties of strongly correlated impurity

particularly suited for dynamical mean field theory in the nonequilibrium as

permits us to access the Kondo regime for large values of the interaction. In
particular, we investigate the nonequilibrium steady state of a single impurity
Anderson model and focus on the spectral properties for temperatures T below
the Kondo temperature T_K and for small bias voltages phi. For the two cases

binding pocket of the host protein. Using atomistic computer simulation to
predict this residence time and the associated dissociation process is a
desirable but extremely difficult task due to the long timescales involved.
This gets further complicated by the presence of biophysical factors such as
steric and solvation effects. In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations of the unbinding of a popular prototypical hydrophobic
cavity-ligand system using a metadynamics based approach that allows direct
assessment of kinetic pathways and parameters. When constrained to move in an
axial manner, we find the unbinding time to be on the order of 4000 sec. In
accordance with previous studies, we find that the ligand must pass through a
region of sharp dewetting transition manifested by sudden and high fluctuations
in solvent density in the cavity. When we remove the steric constraints on
ligand, the unbinding happens predominantly by an alternate pathway, where the
unbinding becomes 20 times faster, and the sharp dewetting transition instead
becomes continuous. We validate the unbinding timescales from metadynamics
through a Poisson analysis, and by comparison through detailed balance to
binding timescale estimates from unbiased MD. This work demonstrates that
enhanced sampling can be used to perform explicit solvent molecular dynamics
studies at timescales previously unattainable, obtaining direct and reliable
pictures of the underlying physio-chemical factors including free energies and
rate constants.

the calculation of solvation thermodynamics. Here we show that a coarse-grained

informed by this understanding, can capture a broad range of hydrophobic

distributions for microscopic density fluctuations that agree very well with
results of atomistic simulations, even many standard deviations from the mean,
and even for probe volumes in highly heterogeneous environments. This accuracy
is achieved without adjustment of free parameters, as the model is fully
specified by well-known properties of liquid water. As illustrative examples of
its utility, we characterize the free energy profile for a solute crossing the
air-water interface, and compute the thermodynamic cost of evacuating the space

a highly reduced model for aqueous solvation can serve as the basis for
efficient multiscale modeling of spatial organization driven by hydrophobic and

in industry and academia. Considering the current attacking landscape, it is
clear that developing secure software should be a main concern in all software
development projects. In traditional software projects, security issues require
detailed planning in an initial planning phase, typically resulting in a
detailed security analysis (e.g., threat and risk analysis), a security
architecture, and instructions for security implementation (e.g., specification
of key sizes and cryptographic algorithms to use). Agile software development
methods like Scrum are known for reducing the initial planning phases (e.g.,
sprint 0 in Scrum) and for focusing more on producing running code. Scrum is
also known for allowing fast adaption of the emerging software to changes of
customer wishes. For security, this means that it is likely that there are no
detailed security architecture or security implementation instructions from the
start of the project. It also means that a lot of design decisions will be made
during the runtime of the project. Hence, to address security in Scrum, it is
necessary to consider security issues throughout the whole software development
process. Secure Scrum is a variation of the Scrum framework with special focus
on the development of secure software throughout the whole software development
process. It puts emphasis on implementation of security related issues without
the need of changing the underlying Scrum process or influencing team dynamics.
Secure Scrum allows even non- security experts to spot security issues, to
implement security features, and to verify implementations. A field test of
Secure Scrum shows that the security level of software developed using Secure
Scrum is higher then the security level of software developed using standard
Scrum.

Here we illustrate the applicability of img2net to automatedly analyze such
structures by reconstructing the underlying network, computing relevant network
properties, and statistically comparing networks of different types or under
different conditions. The software can be readily used for analyzing image data
of arbitrary 2D and 3D network-like structures. img2net is open-source software

Therefore, it is prevalent to use a rechargeable battery as the noise for
achieving differential privacy in the application of smart grid. Unfortunately,
to the best of our knowledge, we observe that the existing privacy protection
mechanisms cannot satisfy differential privacy, when considering physical
restrictions of the battery in practice. In this paper, we first classify two
types of challenges caused by two physical restrictions, the maximum

stateless privacy protection scheme by exploring a boundary-changeable

to achieve differential privacy under the second type of challenge, and
formalize the definition of a relaxed differential privacy. Finally, we present
a stateful privacy protection scheme that satisfies the relaxed differential

states protected by underlying nontrivial topological invariants of the bulk.
Such immunity from backscattering makes topological surface or edge states
ideal carriers for both classical and quantum information. So far, topological
matters have been explored only in the realms of electronics and photonics,
with limited range of bulk properties and largely immutable materials. These
constraints thus impose severe performance trade-offs in experimentally
realizable topologically ordered states. In contrast, phononic metamaterials
not only provide access to a much wider range of material properties, but also
allow temporal modulation in the non-adiabatic regime. Here, from the
first-principles we demonstrate numerically the first phononic topological
metamaterial in an elastic-wave analogue of the quantum spin Hall effect. A
dual-scale phononic crystal slab is used to support two effective spins of
phonon over a broad bandwidth, and strong spin-orbit coupling is realized by
breaking spatial mirror symmetry. By preserving the spin polarization with an
external load or spatial symmetry, phononic edge states are shown to be robust
against scattering from discrete defects as well as disorders in the continuum.
Our system opens up the possibility of realizing topological materials for
phonons in both static and time-dependent regimes.

superstring appears to enjoy quantum integrability in the planar limit, which
allowed to devise powerful methods ostensibly solving the spectral problem.
However, quantization of the AdS$_5\times\;$S$^5$ superstring from first
principles is still an open question and especially the spectrum of short
string states has previously been derived only at leading order in large 't
Hooft coupling. In this thesis we investigate possible routes to take the
perturbative quantization of short string states beyond the leading order,
where equally our aim is to gain better appreciation of the quantum symmetries
at play. A prominent role is played by the lowest excited string states, dual
to the Konishi supermultiplet, and we start by reviewing critically an asserted
derivation of the Konishi anomalous dimension in the setup of pure spinor
string theory. Next, we study the bosonic AdS$_5\times\;$S$^5$ string in static
gauge, where we construct a so-called single-mode string solution, which shows
classical integrability and invariance under the isometries
SO(2,4)$\;\times\;$SO(6) at the quantum level. Arguing heuristically about the
effects of supersymmetry, we indeed recover the first non-trivial quantum
correction to the Konishi anomalous dimension. We continue by implementing
static gauge for the full AdS$_5\times\;$S$^5$ superstring and find elegant
expressions for the Lagrangian density and the supercharges. We then constrain
our interest to the superparticle and, using two different methods, find
canonical coordinates at quadratic order in fermions. As the single-mode string
is just the SO(2,4)$\;\times\;$SO(6) orbit of the pulsating string, we conclude
by applying orbit method quantization to the particle and spinning string
solutions in bosonic AdS$_3\times\;$S$^3$ yielding consistent results for the
spectra.

of MOND on galactic scales with the triumph of the LambdaCDM model on
cosmological scales. This is achieved through the rich and well-studied physics
of superfluidity. The dark matter and MOND components have a common origin,
representing different phases of a single underlying substance. In galaxies,
dark matter thermalizes and condenses to form a superfluid phase. The
superfluid phonons couple to baryonic matter particles and mediate a MOND-like
force. Our framework naturally distinguishes between galaxies (where MOND is
successful) and galaxy clusters (where MOND is not): dark matter has a higher
temperature in clusters, and hence is in a mixture of superfluid and normal
phase. The rich and well-studied physics of superfluidity leads to a number of
striking observational signatures, which we briefly discuss. Remarkably the
critical temperature and equation of state of the dark matter superfluid are
similar to those of known cold atom systems. Identifying a precise cold atom
analogue would give important insights on the microphysical interactions
underlying DM superfluidity. Tantalizingly, it might open the possibility of

population synthesis models, are widely used to estimate galaxy stellar masses

is still lacking. We quantify several potential sources of uncertainty, using
optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry for a representative sample of
nearby galaxies from the Virgo cluster. Our method for combining multi-band
photometry with MLCRs yields robust stellar masses, while errors in M$_*$
decrease as more bands are simultaneously considered. The prior assumptions in
one's stellar population modelling dominate the error budget, creating a
colour-dependent bias of up to 0.6 dex if NIR fluxes are used (0.3 dex
otherwise). This matches the systematic errors associated with the method of
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, indicating that MLCRs do not suffer
from much additional bias. Moreover, MLCRs and SED fitting yield similar
degrees of random error ($\sim$0.1-0.14 dex) when applied to mock galaxies and,
on average, equivalent masses for real galaxies with M$_* \sim$ 10$^{8-11}$
M$_{\odot}$. The use of integrated photometry introduces additional uncertainty
in M$_*$ measurements, at the level of 0.05-0.07 dex. We argue that using
MLCRs, instead of time-consuming SED fits, is justified in cases with complex
model parameter spaces (involving, for instance, multi-parameter star formation
histories) and/or for large datasets. Spatially-resolved methods for measuring
M$_*$ should be applied for small sample sizes and/or when accuracies less than
0.1 dex are required. An Appendix provides our MLCR transformations for ten

steeper slopes of the log(SFR)-log($M_*$) relation. Our sample is immune from

a component attributed to on-going accretion by the active galactic nuclei

refer to as the 'non-core'. These BCGs are matched to previous studies to
determine whether they exhibit emission lines (principally H-alpha), indicative
of the presence of a strong cooling cluster core. We consider how the radio
properties of the BCGs vary with cluster environmental factors. Line emitting
BCGs are shown to generally host more powerful radio sources, exhibiting the
presence of a strong, distinguishable core component in about 60% of cases.
This core component more strongly correlates with the BCG's [OIII]5007A line

sources of radiation for this transition are quasars, so modeling the source
population accurately is very important for making reliable predictions. In
this first paper, we present a new method for populating dark matter halos with
quasars. Our set of quasar models include two different light curves, a
lightbulb (simple on/off) and symmetric exponential model, and
luminosity-dependent quasar lifetimes. Our method self-consistently reproduces
an input quasar luminosity function (QLF) given a halo catalog from an $N$-body
simulation, and propagates quasars through the merger history of halo hosts.
After calibrating quasar clustering using measurements from BOSS, we find that
the characteristic mass of quasar hosts is $M_h \sim 2.5 \times 10^{12}

quasar luminosity for a given halo mass is larger than that in the lightbulb
model, typically by a factor of 1.5-2. The effective lifetime for quasars in
the lightbulb model is 59 Myr, and in the exponential case, the effective time
constant is about 15 Myr. We include semi-analytic calculations of helium
reionization, and discuss how to include these quasars as sources of ionizing

ac drives are aligned in the longitudinal direction parallel to the direction
of the substrate modulation, the velocity-force curves exhibit classic Shapiro
step features when the frequency of the ac drive matches the washboard
frequency that is dynamically generated by the motion of the skyrmions over the
substrate, similar to previous observations in superconducting vortex systems.
In the case of skyrmions, the additional contribution to the skyrmion motion
from a non-dissipative Magnus force shifts the location of the locking steps to
higher dc drives, and we find that the skyrmions move at an angle with respect
to the direction of the dc drive. For a longitudinal dc drive and a
perpendicular or transverse ac drive, the overdamped system exhibits no Shapiro
steps; however, when a finite Magnus force is present we find pronounced
transverse Shapiro steps along with complex two-dimensional periodic orbits of
the skyrmions in the phase-locked regimes. Both the longitudinal and transverse
ac drives produce locking steps whose widths oscillate with increasing ac drive
amplitude. We examine the role of collective skyrmion interactions and find
that additional fractional locking steps occur for both longitudinal and
transverse ac drives. At higher skyrmion densities, the system undergoes a
series of dynamical order-disorder transitions, with the skyrmions forming a
moving solid on the phase locking steps and a fluctuating dynamical liquid in
regimes between the steps.

gives access to the critical temperature T_c of the q-state Potts model on a

unit cells of L, and the relevant root of P_B(q,T) was observed to converge
quickly to T_c in the limit n,m to infinity. Moreover, in exactly solvable
cases there is no finite-size dependence at all.
  We reformulate this method as an eigenvalue problem within the periodic
Temperley-Lieb algebra. This corresponds to taking m to infinity first, so the
bases B are semi-infinite cylinders of circumference n. The limit implies
faster convergence in n, while maintaining the n-independence in exactly
solvable cases. In this setup, T_c(n) is determined by equating the largest
eigenvalues of two topologically distinct sectors of the transfer matrix.
Crucially, these two sectors determine the same critical exponent in the
continuum limit, and the observed fast convergence is thus corroborated by
results of conformal field theory. We obtain similar results for the dense and
dilute phases of the O(N) loop model, using now a transfer matrix within the
dilute periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra.
  The eigenvalue formulation allows us to double the size n for which T_c(n)
can be obtained, using the same computational effort. We study in details three
significant cases: (i) bond percolation on the kagome lattice, up to n = 14;
(ii) site percolation on the square lattice, to n = 21; and (iii) self-avoiding
polygons on the square lattice, to n = 19. Convergence properties of T_c(n) and

which has an internal conversion to a muon or an electron pair (ll gamma). The
analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS
detector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The events selected have an
opposite-sign muon or electron pair and a high transverse momentum photon. No
excess above background has been found in the three-body invariant mass range
120 < m[ll gamma] < 150 GeV, and limits have been derived for the Higgs boson
production cross section times branching fraction for the decay H to gamma*
gamma to ll gamma, where the dilepton invariant mass is less than 20 GeV. For a
Higgs boson with m[H] = 125 GeV, a 95% confidence level (CL) exclusion observed
(expected) limit is 6.7 (5.9 +2.8/-1.8) times the standard model prediction.
Additionally, an upper limit at 95% CL on the branching fraction of H to J/Psi
gamma for the 125 GeV Higgs boson is set at 1.5E-3.

that performs only a single maximum eigenvector computation per time step. Here
$T$ is the number of rounds and $N$ is the matrix dimension. Our algorithm and

are free closed strings, the $N=\infty$ partition function diverges above a
finite temperature $\beta_H^{-1}$, the Hagedorn temperature. We argue that in
these models at finite $N$, which then have a finite number of degrees of

be removed at finite $N$. In this resolution the fundamental string bit degrees
of freedom become more active at temperatures near and above the Hagedorn

description in terms of $\check{g}^2 = 1$ Green functions, so-called circuit

action, most generally a Keldysh one, that can be further used as a building
bock of theories describing statistics of electron transport, superconducting
correlations, time-dependent and interaction effects. The action is usually
used in the form suitable for a two-terminal scatterer.
  Here we provide a comprehensive derivation of a more general form of the
action that is especially suitable and convenient for general multi-terminal
scatterers. The action is expressed as a determinant of a block of the
scattering matrix obtained by projection on the positive eigenvalues of the
Green functions characterizing the reservoirs. We start with traditional Green
function formalism introducing $\check{g}^2 = 1$ matrices and give a first
example of multi-terminal counting statistics. Further we consider
one-dimensional channels and discuss chiral anomaly arising in this context.
Generalizing on many channels and superconducting situation, we arrive at the
block-determinant relation. We give the necessary elaborative examples

extracted automatically from science textbooks, expressed in a subset of
first-order logic. Given the incomplete and noisy nature of these automatically
extracted rules, Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) seem a natural model to use, but
the exact way of leveraging MLNs is by no means obvious. We investigate three
ways of applying MLNs to our task. In the first, we simply use the extracted
science rules directly as MLN clauses. Unlike typical MLN applications, our
domain has long and complex rules, leading to an unmanageable number of
groundings. We exploit the structure present in hard constraints to improve
tractability, but the formulation remains ineffective. In the second approach,
we instead interpret science rules as describing prototypical entities, thus
mapping rules directly to grounded MLN assertions, whose constants are then
clustered using existing entity resolution methods. This drastically simplifies
the network, but still suffers from brittleness. Finally, our third approach,
called Praline, uses MLNs to align the lexical elements as well as define and
control how inference should be performed in this task. Our experiments,
demonstrating a 15\% accuracy boost and a 10x reduction in runtime, suggest
that the flexibility and different inference semantics of Praline are a better
fit for the natural language question answering task.

of gigabytes of RAM, a significant fraction of many analytic databases becomes
memory-resident. Even after careful tuning for an in-memory environment, a
linear disk I/O model such as the one implemented in PostgreSQL may make query
response time predictions that are up to 2X slower than the optimal multi-join

model to identify good evaluation strategies for complex query plans with
multiple hash-based equi-joins over memory-resident data. The proposed cost
model is carefully validated for accuracy using three different systems,
including an Amazon EC2 instance, to control for hardware-specific differences.
Prior work in parallel query evaluation has advocated right-deep and bushy
trees for multi-join queries due to their greater parallelization and
pipelining potential. A surprising finding is that the conventional wisdom from
shared-nothing disk-based systems does not directly apply to the modern
shared-everything memory hierarchy. As corroborated by our model, the
performance gap between the optimal left-deep and right-deep query plan can

theoretic notions of growth and quasi-isometry. A graph has the $n$-containment
property if for every finite initial fire, there is a strategy to contain the
fire by protecting $n$ vertices at each turn. A graph has the constant
containment property if there is an integer $n$ such that it has the
$n$-containment property. Our first result is that any locally finite connected
graph with quadratic growth has the constant containment property; the converse
does not hold. This result provides a unified way to recover previous results
in the literature, in particular the class of graphs satisfying the constant
containment property is infinite. A second result is that in the class of
graphs with bounded degree, having the constant containment property is
preserved by quasi-isometry. Some sample consequences of the second result are
that any regular tiling of the Euclidean plane has the fire containment
property; no regular tiling of the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space has the
containment property if $n>2$; and no regular tiling of the $n$-dimensional
hyperbolic space has the containment property if $n\geq 2$. We prove analogous

formation in BEC of alkali atoms. This scheme requires inversion of the bias
magnetic field along the axis of the condensate, which leads to atom loss when
the bias field crosses zero. In this Letter, we propose a scheme with which the
atom loss is greatly suppressed by adding counter-diabatic magnetic field. A
naive counter-diabatic field violates the Maxwell equations and we need to
introduce an approximation to make it physically feasible. The resulting field
requires an extra currents, which is experimentally challenging. Finally we
solve this problem by applying a gauge transformation so that the
counter-diabatic field is generated by controlling the original trap field with
the additional control of the bias field.

interest from an image is to annotate a bounding box that covers the foreground
object. Then, a binary labeling is performed to achieve a refined segmentation.
One major issue of the existing algorithms for such interactive image
segmentation is their preference of an input bounding box that tightly encloses
the foreground object. This increases the annotation burden, and prevents these
algorithms from utilizing automatically detected bounding boxes. In this paper,
we develop a new LooseCut algorithm that can handle cases where the input
bounding box only loosely covers the foreground object. We propose a new Markov
Random Fields (MRF) model for segmentation with loosely bounded boxes,
including a global similarity constraint to better distinguish the foreground
and background, and an additional energy term to encourage consistent labeling
of similar-appearance pixels. This MRF model is then solved by an iterated
max-flow algorithm. In the experiments, we evaluate LooseCut in three
publicly-available image datasets, and compare its performance against several
state-of-the-art interactive image segmentation algorithms. We also show that
LooseCut can be used for enhancing the performance of unsupervised video
segmentation and image saliency detection.

administered by self-interested agents, each seeking to achieve the highest
evaluation and win the experiment. For example, in an advertising experiment, a
company wishes to evaluate two marketing agents in terms of their efficacy in
viral marketing, and assign a contract to the winner agent. Contrary to
traditional experimental design, this problem has two new implications. First,
the experiment induces a game among agents, where each agent can select from
multiple versions of the treatment it administers. Second, the action of one
agent -- selection of treatment version -- may affect the actions of another
agent, with the resulting strategic interference complicating the evaluation of
agents. An incentive-compatible experiment design is one with an equilibrium
where each agent selects its natural action, which is the action that would
maximize the performance of the agent if there was no competition (e.g.,
expected number of conversions if agent was assigned the contract). Under a
general formulation of experimental design, we identify sufficient conditions
that guarantee incentive-compatible experiments. These conditions rely on the
existence of statistics that can estimate how agents would perform without
competition, and their use in constructing score functions to evaluate the
agents. In the setting with no strategic interference, we also study the power
of the design, i.e., the probability that the best agent wins, and show how to
improve the power of incentive-compatible designs. From the technical side, our
theory uses a range of statistical methods such as hypothesis testing,
variance-stabilizing transformations and the Delta method, all of which rely on

exceeding the previous historically brightest flare observed by {\it EGRET} in
1996. The high activity period consists of three major flares with the last one
being the brightest. All but one flares show a faster rise and slower decay
pattern and at the peak of the activity, the $\gamma$-ray spectrum is found to
show a clear signature of break/curvature. The obtained spectral parameters
hint for the peak of the inverse Compton emission to lie in the LAT energy
range (around $\sim$1 GeV) which is in contrast to that seen during the 2013
December and 2014 April $\gamma$-ray flares of 3C 279. From the $\gamma\gamma$
pair opacity arguments, the minimum Doppler factor is estimated to be 14 and
the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region is found to be either at the
outer edge of the broad line region or farther out from it.

properties such as critical phenomena, nucleation, pinning, domain wall motion,
coercivity, etc. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has been applied
extensively to study dynamics of magnetic properties. Approaches of Langevin
noises have been developed to introduce the temperature effect into the LLG
equation. To have the thermal equilibrium state (canonical distribution) as the
steady state, the system parameters must satisfy some condition known as the
fluctuation-dissipation relation. In inhomogeneous magnetic systems in which
spin magnitudes are different at sites, the condition requires that the ratio
between the amplitude of the random noise and the damping parameter depends on
the magnitude of the magnetic moment at each site. Focused on inhomogeneous
magnetic systems, we systematically showed agreement between the stationary
state of the stochastic LLG equation and the corresponding equilibrium state
obtained by Monte Carlo simulations in various magnetic systems including
dipole-dipole interactions. We demonstrated how violations of the condition
result in deviations from the true equilibrium state. We also studied the
characteristic features of the dynamics depending on the choice of the
parameter set. All the parameter sets satisfying the condition realize the same
stationary state (equilibrium state). In contrast, different choices of
parameter set cause seriously different relaxation processes. We show two
relaxation types, i.e., magnetization reversals with uniform rotation and with
nucleation.

to its neighbor and the value for viscosity is set to be as small as possible.
Therefore, model simulations are not converged with resolution and boundary
separation points differ in essential properties from flow separation in
continuous flow fields. In this paper, we investigate the quality of the
representation of boundary separation points in global ocean models. To this
end, we apply well established criteria for boundary separation within an
idealized ocean model setup. We investigate an eddy-resolving as well as a
steady test case with idealized and unstructured coast lines in a shallow water
model that is based on a finite element discretization method.
  The results show that well established criteria for separation fail to detect
boundary separation points due to an insufficient representation of ocean flows
along free-slip boundaries. Along no-slip boundaries, most separation criteria
provide adequate results. However, a very sophisticated criterion based on
dynamical system theory reveals that the representation of boundary separation
is limited for these flows as well. We conclude that the representation of
boundary separation points in numerical ocean models is not satisfying. This
will have an impact on the separation of boundary currents in global ocean

solving for a four-region model the static and spherically symmetric
Klein-Gordon equation for the chameleon field. By modeling not only the test
mass and the vacuum chamber but also its walls and the exterior environment,
the method allows to probe new effects on the scalar field profile and the
induced acceleration of atoms. In the case of a weakly perturbing test mass,
the effect of the wall is to enhance the field profile and to lower the
acceleration inside the chamber by up to one order of magnitude. In the
thin-shell regime, results are found to be in good agreement with the
analytical estimations, when measurements are realized in the immediate
vicinity of the test mass. Close to the vacuum chamber wall, the acceleration
becomes negative and potentially measurable. This prediction could be used to
discriminate between fifth-force effects and systematic experimental
uncertainties, by doing the experiment at several key positions inside the
vacuum chamber. For the chameleon potential $V(\phi) = \Lambda^{4+\alpha} /
\phi^\alpha$ and a coupling function $A(\phi) = \exp(\phi /M)$, one finds $M
\gtrsim 7 \times 10^{16} \mathrm{GeV}$, independently of the power-law index.
For $V(\phi) = \Lambda^4 (1+ \Lambda/ \phi)$, one finds $M \gtrsim 10^{14}

the model up to the Planck scale. Finally, a proposal for a second experimental
set-up, in a vacuum room, is presented. In this case, Planckian values of $M$
could be probed provided that $a \sim 10^{-10} \mathrm{m/s^2}$, a limit
reachable by future experiments. Our method can easily be extended to constrain
other models with a screening mechanism, such as symmetron, dilaton and f(R)

  survival forests",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Random survival forests (RSF) are a powerful method for risk prediction of
right-censored outcomes in biomedical research. RSF use the log-rank split
criterion to form an ensemble of survival trees. The most common approach to
evaluate the prediction accuracy of a RSF model is Harrell's concordance index
for survival data ('C index'). Conceptually, this strategy implies that the
split criterion in RSF is different from the evaluation criterion of interest.
This discrepancy can be overcome by using Harrell's C for both node splitting
and evaluation. We compare the difference between the two split criteria
analytically and in simulation studies with respect to the preference of more
unbalanced splits, termed end-cut preference (ECP). Specifically, we show that
the log-rank statistic has a stronger ECP compared to the C index. In
simulation studies and with the help of two medical data sets we demonstrate
that the accuracy of RSF predictions, as measured by Harrell's C, can be
improved if the log-rank statistic is replaced by the C index for node
splitting. This is especially true in situations where the censoring rate or
the fraction of informative continuous predictor variables is high. Conversely,
log-rank splitting is preferable in noisy scenarios. Both C-based and log-rank
splitting are implemented in the R~package ranger. We recommend Harrell's C as
split criterion for use in smaller scale clinical studies and the log-rank
split criterion for use in large-scale 'omics' studies.

background of the Universe can be made a solution of a simple geometric sigma
model. Geometric sigma models are purely geometric theories in which spacetime
coordinates are seen as scalar fields coupled to gravity. Although they look
like ordinary sigma models, they have the peculiarity that their complete
matter content can be gauged away. The remaining geometric theory possesses a
background solution that is predefined in the process of constructing the
theory. The fact that background configuration is specified in advance is
another peculiarity of geometric sigma models. In this paper, I construct
geometric sigma models based on different background geometries of the
Universe. Whatever background geometry is chosen, the dynamics of its small
perturbations is shown to posses a generic classical stability. This way, any
freely chosen background metric is made a stable solution of a simple model.
Three particular models of the Universe are considered as examples of how this
is done in practice.

flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) processes and hence promising channels
with which to probe the limits of the standard model and to look for signs of
new physics. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of lattice
calculations of $K\to\pi\ell^+\ell^-$ decay amplitudes for which long-distance
contributions are very significant. We show that the dominant finite-volume
corrections (those decreasing as powers of the volume) are negligibly small and
that, in the four-flavor theory, no new ultraviolet divergences appear as the
electromagnetic current $J$ and the effective weak Hamiltonian $H_W$ approach
each other. In addition, we demonstrate that one can remove the unphysical
terms which grow exponentially with the range of the integration over the time
separation between $J$ and $H_W$. We will now proceed to exploratory numerical
studies with the aim of motivating further experimental measurements of these
decays. Our work extends the earlier study by Isidori, Turchetti and Martinelli
which focussed largely on the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences. In a
companion paper we discuss the evaluation of the long-distance contributions to
$K\to\pi\nu\bar{\nu}$ decays; these contributions are expected to be at the
level of a few percent for $K^+$ decays.

they are the only systems where the distribution of the different components
can be studied both radially and vertically. The HEROES project was designed to
investigate the interplay between the gas, dust, stars and dark matter (DM) in
a sample of 7 massive edge-on spiral galaxies.
  Aims. In this second HEROES paper we present an analysis of the atomic gas
content of 6 out of 7 galaxies in our sample. The remaining galaxy was recently
analysed according to the same strategy. The primary aim of this work is to
constrain the surface density distribution, the rotation curve and the geometry
of the gas disks in a homogeneous way. In addition we identify peculiar
features and signs of recent interactions.
  Methods. We construct detailed tilted-ring models of the atomic gas disks
based on new GMRT 21-cm observations of NGC 973 and UGC 4277 and re-reduced
archival HI data of NGC 5907, NGC 5529, IC 2531 and NGC 4217. Potential
degeneracies between different models are resolved by requiring a good
agreement with the data in various representations of the data cubes.
  Results. From our modelling we find that all but one galaxy are warped along
the major axis. In addition, we identify warps along the line of sight in three
galaxies. A flaring gas layer is required to reproduce the data only for one
galaxy, but (moderate) flares cannot be ruled for the other galaxies either. A
coplanar ring-like structure is detected outside the main disk of NGC 4217,
which we suggest could be the remnant of a recent minor merger event. We also
find evidence for a radial inflow of 15 +- 5 km/s in the disk of NGC 5529,
which might be related to the ongoing interaction with two nearby companions.

value correction of the type originally proposed by Bramble, Dupont, and
Thomee. The cut finite element method is a fictitious domain method with
Nitsche type enforcement of Dirichlet conditions together with stabilization of
the elements at the boundary which is stable and enjoy optimal order
approximation properties. A computational difficulty is, however, the geometric
computations related to quadrature on the cut elements which must be accurate
enough to achieve higher order approximation. With boundary value correction we
may use only a piecewise linear approximation of the boundary, which is very
convenient in a cut finite element method, and still obtain optimal order
convergence. The boundary value correction is a modified Nitsche formulation
involving a Taylor expansion in the normal direction compensating for the
approximation of the boundary. Key to the analysis is a consistent
stabilization term which enables us to prove stability of the method and a
priori error estimates with explicit dependence on the meshsize and distance
between the exact and approximate boundary.

equivalences between the concepts of two ontologies. Most ontology matching
algorithms are based on two types of strategies: terminology-based strategies,
which align concepts based on their names or descriptions, and structure-based
strategies, which exploit concept hierarchies to find the alignment. In many
domains, there is additional information about the relationships of concepts
represented in various ways, such as Bayesian networks, decision trees, and
association rules. We propose to use the similarities between these
relationships to find more accurate alignments. We accomplish this by defining
soft constraints that prefer alignments where corresponding concepts have the
same local relationships encoded as knowledge rules. We use a probabilistic
framework to integrate this new knowledge-based strategy with standard
terminology-based and structure-based strategies. Furthermore, our method is
particularly effective in identifying correspondences between complex concepts.
Our method achieves substantially better F-score than the previous
state-of-the-art on three ontology matching domains.

  USENIX Security Symposium. USENIX Association, 2015",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Public infrastructure-as-a-service clouds, such as Amazon EC2, Google Compute
Engine (GCE) and Microsoft Azure allow clients to run virtual machines (VMs) on
shared physical infrastructure. This practice of multi-tenancy brings economies
of scale, but also introduces the risk of sharing a physical server with an
arbitrary and potentially malicious VM. Past works have demonstrated how to
place a VM alongside a target victim (co-location) in early-generation clouds
and how to extract secret information via side- channels. Although there have
been numerous works on side-channel attacks, there have been no studies on
placement vulnerabilities in public clouds since the adoption of stronger
isolation technologies such as Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).
  We investigate this problem of placement vulnerabilities and quantitatively
evaluate three popular public clouds for their susceptibility to co-location
attacks. We find that adoption of new technologies (e.g., VPC) makes many prior
attacks, such as cloud cartography, ineffective. We find new ways to reliably
test for co-location across Amazon EC2, Google GCE, and Microsoft Azure. We
also found ways to detect co-location with victim web servers in a multi-tiered
cloud application located behind a load balancer.
  We use our new co-residence tests and multiple customer accounts to launch VM
instances under different strategies that seek to maximize the likelihood of
co-residency. We find that it is much easier (10x higher success rate) and
cheaper (up to $114 less) to achieve co-location in these three clouds when
compared to a secure reference placement policy.

ongoing intrusions, e.g., by documenting the approach of an attacker. Honeypots
do so by presenting an interactive system that seems just like a valid
application to an attacker. One of the main design goals of honeypots is to
stay unnoticed by attackers as long as possible. The longer the intruder
interacts with the honeypot, the more valuable information about the attack can
be collected. Of course, another main goal of honeypots is to not open new
vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Thus, it is necessary to harden the
honeypot and the surrounding environment. This paper presents Apate, a Linux
Kernel Module (LKM) that is able to log, block and manipulate system calls
based on preconfigurable conditions like Process ID (PID), User Id (UID), and
many more. Apate can be used to build and harden High Interaction Honeypots.
Apate can be configured using an integrated high level language. Thus, Apate is
an important and easy to use building block for upcoming High Interaction
Honeypots.

Multifractal analysis is becoming a standard tool in signal and image

the H\""older exponent, by nature restricted to positive values, and thus to
locally bounded functions or signals. It is here proposed to base the

measure potentially taking negative values. First, the theoretical properties
of $p$-exponents are studied in detail. Second, wavelet-based multiscale
quantities, the $p$-leaders, are constructed and shown to permit accurate
practical estimation of $p$-exponents. Exploiting the potential dependence with
$p$, it is also shown how the collection of $p$-exponents enriches the
classification of locally singular behaviors in functions, signals or images.

control, computation, communication and Information (C3I) technologies. Design
decisions of one domain are affected by the constraints posed by others.
Reliable NAS design should address the requirements of the system, and
simultaneously meet the constraints posed by other domains and this is called
co-design in literature. Co-design requires clear definition of interfaces
among these domains. Control design in NAS is affected by the timing
imperfections posed by other domains. In this investigation, we first study the
different sources of timing imperfections in NAS, and classify them based on
their occurrence. The concept of jitter is used to define the timing
imperfections induced by various system components. Using this analysis, we
classify the jitter based on their behavior and domain of occurrence. Our
analysis shows that the jitter induced in NAS can be classified based on domain
as- hardware, software and communication. Next, we use this analysis to model
the jitter from the components of NAS. Modeling timing imperfections helps in
capturing the interfaces among the domains, and we use the concept of design
contracts to capture the interfaces. Design contracts describe the semantic
mapping among the domains and are specified using the jitter margins.
Implementing design contracts requires knowledge of the jitter margin and, the
results from control theory are used to this extent.

goal of this paper is to develop a method for on-line estimation of the Mean

The proposed method models the variations of the stress levels as a stochastic
process. Hence, a stochastic failure rate function can be developed for each
electrical component. Later, this function is used as the underlying rate of a
doubly stochastic Poisson process (known as Cox processes). Furthermore, this
Cox process is used for on-line estimation of the Mean Residual Life (MRL)
using the observed stress levels. The proposed method provides a good estimate
of the age and life expectancy of each component. An experimental case study is
provided to demonstrate the proposed method.

flows in complex systems is a challenging yet important task, with practical
applications in many fields. Data generated by dynamical processes or
large-scale systems are often symbolized, either because of the finite
resolution of the measurement apparatus, or because of the need of statistical
estimation. By algorithmic application of causation entropy, we investigated
the effects of symbolization on important concepts such as Markov order and
causal structure of the tent map. We uncovered that these quantities depend
nonmontonically and, most of all, sensitively on the choice of symbolization.
Indeed, we show that Markov order and causal structure do not necessarily
converge to their original analog counterparts as the resolution of the
partitioning becomes finer.

  There is not obtained real values for Einstein rings locations

test of our calculations, we choose mass $M$ of 60 type of most massive
observed galactic black holes as gravitational lens and study quantum matter
fields effects on the angle of bending light rays in presence of the
cosmological constant effects. We calculate locations of non-relativistic
images and corresponding magnifications. Numerical diagrams show that the
quantum matter effects cause to be reduce absolute values of the quantum
deflection angle with respect to the classical ones. Sign of the quantum
deflection angle is changed with respect to the classical values in presence of
the cosmological constant. This means dominance of anti-gravity counterpart of
the cosmological horizon on the bending light rays angle with respect to
absorbing effects of local 60 type of observed most massive black holes.
Variations of the image positions and magnifications are negligible by
increasing dimensionless cosmological constant $\epsilon=\frac{16\Lambda

and they decrease very fast (slow) by increasing closest distance $x_0$ of
