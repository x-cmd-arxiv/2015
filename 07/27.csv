efficient encoding of paths through the network. We introduce a mathematical
formulation of this optimal path-encoding problem. We prove that the problem is

problems for several marginals, and as such have a wide range of applications
ranging from economics to statistics and computer science. When the marginal
probability measures are absolutely continuous (or vanish on small sets) the
theory of Wasserstein barycenters is well-developed (see the seminal paper
[1]). However, exact continuous computation of Wasserstein barycenters in this
setting is tractable in only a small number of specialized cases. Moreover, in
many applications data is given as a set of probability measures with finite
support. In this paper, we develop theoretical results for Wasserstein
barycenters in this discrete setting. Our results rely heavily on polyhedral
theory which is possible due to the discrete structure of the marginals.
  Our results closely mirror those in the continuous case with a few
exceptions. In this discrete setting we establish that Wasserstein barycenters
must also be discrete measures and there is always a barycenter which is
provably sparse. Moreover, for each Wasserstein barycenter there exists a
non-mass-splitting optimal transport to each of the discrete marginals. Such
non-mass-splitting transports do not generally exist between two discrete
measures unless special mass balance conditions hold. This makes Wasserstein
barycenters in this discrete setting special in this regard.
  We illustrate the results of our discrete barycenter theory with a
proof-of-concept computation for a hypothetical transportation problem with
multiple marginals: distributing a fixed set of goods when the demand can take
on different distributional shapes characterized by the discrete marginal
distributions. A Wasserstein barycenter, in this case, represents an optimal
distribution of inventory facilities which minimize the squared
distance/transportation cost totaled over all demands.

from oil and gas extractions in Albania have been disposed without regulatory
criteria in many decades, an extensive survey in one of the most productive
regions (Vlora-Elbasan) has been performed. Among 52 gamma-ray spectrometry
measurements of soil, oil-sand, sludge, produced water and crude oil samples,
we discover that relatively low activity concentrations of 226Ra, 228Ra, 228Th
and 40K, which are 23 +/- 2 Bq/kg, 23 +/- 2 Bq/kg, 24 +/- 3 Bq/kg and 549 +/-
12 Bq/kg, respectively, come from oil-sand produced by hydrocarbon extraction
from molasses formations. The mineralogical characterization together with the
228Ra/40K and 226Ra/40K ratios of these Neogene deposits confirm the geological
and geodynamic model that predicts a dismantling of Mesozoic source rocks. The
average activity concentrations (+/- standard deviations) of the radium
isotopes (226Ra, 228Ra) and of the 228Th and 40K radionuclides in soil samples
are determined to be 20 +/- 5 Bq/kg, 25 +/- 10 Bq/kg, 25 +/- 9 Bq/kg and 326

assessment of other fields in the region can be strategically planned focusing
on the oil-sands from molasses sediments. No disequilibrium in the 228Ra decay
segment has been observed in soil, sludge and oil-sand samples within the
standard uncertainties. After a detailed radiological characterization of the
four main oilfields, we can conclude that the outdoor absorbed dose rate never

$\mu_I>{m_\pi}/{2}$ under the temporal twisted boundary conditions for quarks.
We demonstrate that this dual condensate exhibits the similar temperature

  bounded average degree","The result of this paper generalizes the result of our previous work
  arXiv:1503.03351",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a notion of contraction function for a family of graphs and
establish its connection to the strong spatial mixing for spin systems. More
specifically, we show that for anti-ferromagnetic Potts model on families of
graphs characterized by a specific contraction function, the model exhibits
strong spatial mixing, and if further the graphs exhibit certain local sparsity
which are very natural and easy to satisfy by typical sparse graphs, then we
also have FPTAS for computing the partition function.
  This new characterization of strong spatial mixing of multi-spin system does
not require maximum degree of the graphs to be bounded, but instead it relates
the decay of correlation of the model to a notion of effective average degree
measured by the contraction of a function on the family of graphs. It also
generalizes other notion of effective average degree which may determine the
strong spatial mixing, such as the connective constant, whose connection to
strong spatial mixing is only known for very simple models and is not
extendable to general spin systems.
  As direct consequences: (1) we obtain FPTAS for the partition function of
$q$-state anti-ferromagnetic Potts model with activity $0\le\beta<1$ on graphs
of maximum degree bounded by $d$ when $q> 3(1-\beta)d+1$, improving the
previous best bound $\beta> 3(1-\beta)d$ and asymptotically approaching the
inapproximability threshold $q=(1-\beta)d$, and (2) we obtain an efficient
sampler (in the same sense of fully polynomial-time almost uniform sampler,
FPAUS) for the Potts model on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph
$\mathcal{G}(n,d/n)$ with sufficiently large constant $d$, provided that $q>
3(1-\beta)d+4$. In particular when $\beta=0$, the sampler becomes an FPAUS for
for proper $q$-coloring in $\mathcal{G}(n,d/n)$ with $q> 3d+4$, improving the
current best bound $q> 5.5d$ for FPAUS for $q$-coloring in
$\mathcal{G}(n,d/n)$.

challenging because the standard approach is based on a Monte Carlo method

pattern correlation, if present, between the diagonal of the inverse of the

contained into a {\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\mathfrak{q}$
such that $rad(\mathfrak{q})=\mathfrak{m}\in max(k[\chi])$ is a maximal and
thus prime ideal with $dim\_k(M)=dim\_k(k[\chi]/\mathfrak{q})=2^n$ at least.
Accordingly, any primary ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ may not be a member of the
primary decomposition of an unmixed ideal $\mathfrak{a} \subseteq \mathfrak{q}$
of the principal class. Otherwise, $\mathfrak{q}$ is said to be of the {\it
principal noetherian class} "". Our aim is to explain this result in a modern
language and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The
importance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit
symbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive. Another interest of
this example is that it has properties quite similar to the ones held by the
system of conformal Killing equations which are still not known. For this
reason, we have put all the examples at the end of the paper and each one is
presented in a rather independent way though a few among them are quite tricky.
Meanwhile, the second purpose is to prove that the methods developped by
Macaulay in order to study {\it unmixed polynomial ideals} are only particular
examples of new formal differential geometric techniques that have been
introduced recently in order to study {\it pure differential modules}. However
these procedures are based on the formal theory of systems of ordinary
differential (OD) or partial differential (PD) equations, in particular on a
systematic use of the Spencer operator, and are still not acknowledged by the
algebraic community.

a system estimate with lower mean square error (MSE) than the ML estimator for
finite-length experiments, it is usually considered the best choice in practice

system which combines a fast search procedure, coupled with a state-of-the-art
commercial off the shelf (COTS) matcher, in a cascaded framework. Given a probe
face, we first filter the large gallery of photos to find the top-k most
similar faces using deep features generated from a convolutional neural
network. The k candidates are re-ranked by combining similarities from deep
features and the COTS matcher. We evaluate the proposed face search system on a
gallery containing 80 million web-downloaded face images. Experimental results
demonstrate that the deep features are competitive with state-of-the-art
methods on unconstrained face recognition benchmarks (LFW and IJB-A). Further,
the proposed face search system offers an excellent trade-off between accuracy
and scalability on datasets consisting of millions of images. Additionally, in

multiple-epoch, absorption line variability study of 12 FeLoBAL quasars

ground and excited state Fe II multiplets, the Mg II 2796, 2803 doublet, Mg I

evidence of saturation in the absorption lines favors transverse motions of gas
across the line of sight (LOS) as the preferred scenario, and allows us to
constrain the outflow distance from the supermassive black hole (SMBH) to be
less than 69, 7, and 60 pc for our three variable sources. In combination with

solving the dressed charge matrix equations and setting the number of
occupancies to one, as an alternative to the usual zero often used by authors
in literatures. Our result shows the critical exponents of the correlation
function grows monotonically with magnetic field and reduces to definite values
at zero magnetic field around various Fermi points.

through $\bar{\nu}_e$ disappearance, thus providing a definitive search for
sterile neutrinos. In order to generate the necessary anti-neutrino flux, a
high intensity primary proton beam is needed. In IsoDAR, $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ is
accelerated and is stripped into protons just before the target, to overcome
space charge issues at injection. As part of the design, we have refined an old
proposal to use an RFQ to axially inject bunched $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ ions into the
driver cyclotron. This method has several advantages over a classical low
energy beam transport (LEBT) design: (1) The bunching efficiency is higher than
for the previously considered two-gap buncher and thus the overall injection
efficiency is higher. This relaxes the constraints on the $\mathrm{H}_2^+$
current required from the ion source. (2) The overall length of the LEBT can be
reduced. (3) The RFQ can also accelerate the ions. This enables the ion source
platform high voltage to be reduced from 70 kV to 15 kV, making underground
installation easier. We are presenting the preliminary RFQ design parameters
and first beam dynamics simulations from the ion source to the spiral inflector
entrance.

experimentally validate a particular case of the so-called Tsallis-Bukman
scaling law, $\alpha = 2 / (3 - q)$, where $q$ is obtained by fitting the
probability density function (PDF) of the measured fluctuations with a
$q$-Gaussian distribution, and the diffusion exponent is measured independently
during the experiment. Applying an original technique, we are able to evince a
transition from an anomalous diffusion regime to a Brownian behavior as a
function of the length of the strain-window used to calculate the displacements
of grains in experiments. The outstanding conformity of fitting curves to a
massive amount of experimental data shows a clear broadening of the fluctuation
PDFs as the length of the strain-window decreases, and an increment in the
value of the diffusion exponent - anomalous diffusion. Regardless of the size
of the strain-window considered in the measurements, we show that the
Tsallis-Bukman scaling law remains valid, which is the first experimental
verification of this relationship for a classical system at different diffusion
regimes. We also note that the spatial correlations show marked similarities to
the turbulence in fluids, a promising indication that this type of analysis can
be used to explore the origins of the macroscopic friction in confined granular
materials.

detection. In this context, the density functions to be estimated are the
background gamma-ray energy spectra at sites spread across a large geographical
area, such as nuclear production and waste-storage sites, military bases,
medical facilities, university campuses, or the downtown of a city. Several
challenges combine to make this a difficult problem. First, the spectral
density at any given spatial location may have both smooth and non-smooth
features. Second, the spatial correlation in these density functions is neither
stationary nor locally isotropic. Finally, at some spatial locations, there is
very little data. We present a method called multiscale spatial density
smoothing that successfully addresses these challenges. The method is based on
recursive dyadic partition of the sample space, and therefore shares much in
common with other multiscale methods, such as wavelets and P\'olya-tree priors.
We describe an efficient algorithm for finding a maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimate that leverages recent advances in convex optimization for non-smooth
functions.

to develop low-dimensional spintronic devices. Using density functional theory,
we show that single-layer chromium trihalides (SLCTs) (CrX$_3$,X=F, Cl, Br and
I) constitute a series of stable 2D intrinsic FM semiconductors. A
free-standing SLCT can be easily exfoliated from the bulk crystal, due to a low
cleavage energy and a high in-plane stiffness. Electronic structure
calculations using the HSE06 functional indicate that both bulk and
single-layer CrX$_3$ are half semiconductors with indirect gaps and their
valence bands and conduction bands are fully spin-polarized in the same spin
direction. The energy gaps and absorption edges of CrBr$_3$ and CrI$_3$ are
found to be in the visible frequency range, which implies possible
opt-electronic applications. Furthermore, SLCTs are found to possess a large
magnetic moment of 3$\mu_B$ per formula unit and a sizable magnetic anisotropy
energy. The magnetic exchange constants of SLCTs are then extracted using the
Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian and the microscopic origins of the various exchange
interactions are analyzed. A competition between a near 90$^\circ$ FM
superexchange and a direct antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange results in a FM
nearest-neighbour exchange interaction. The next and third nearest-neighbour
exchange interactions are found to be FM and AFM respectively and this can be
understood by the angle-dependent extended Cr-X-X-Cr superexchange interaction.
Moreover, the Curie temperatures of SLCTs are also predicted using Monte Carlo
simulations and the values can further increase by applying a biaxial tensile
strain. The unique combination of robust intrinsic ferromagnetism, half
semiconductivity and large magnetic anisotropy energies renders the SLCTs as
promising candidates for next-generation semiconductor spintronic applications.

mitigation of electron cloud in the Fermilab Main Injector. Altogether our
tests represent 2700 ampere-hours of proton operation spanning five years.
Three electron cloud detectors, retarding field analyzers, are installed in a
straight section and allow a direct comparison between the electron flux in the
coated and uncoated stainless steel beampipe. We characterize the electron flux
as a function of intensity up to a maximum of 50 trillion protons per cycle.
Each beampipe material conditions in response to electron bombardment from the

periodic shear flows at low P\'eclet number but high Reynolds number. This
little-studied limit is motivated by astrophysical systems, where the Prandtl
number is often very small. Furthermore, it can be studied using a reduced set
of ""low-P\'eclet-number equations"" proposed by Lignieres [Astronomy &
Astrophysics, 348, 933-939, 1999]. Through a linear stability analysis, we
first determine the conditions for instability to infinitesimal perturbations.
We formally extend Squire's theorem to the low-P\'eclet-number equations, which
shows that the first unstable mode is always two-dimensional. We then perform
an energy stability analysis of the low-P\'eclet-number equations and prove
that for a given value of the Reynolds number, above a critical strength of the
stratification, any smooth periodic shear flow is stable to perturbations of
arbitrary amplitude. In that parameter regime, the flow can only be laminar and
turbulent mixing does not take place. Finding that the conditions for linear
and energy stability are different, we thus identify a region in parameter
space where finite-amplitude instabilities could exist. Using direct numerical
simulations, we indeed find that the system is subject to such finite-amplitude
instabilities. We determine numerically how far into the linearly stable region
of parameter space turbulence can be sustained.

collision model, which is demonstrated by the simulation of the classical
Rayleigh-Taylor instability at various Reynolds numbers. The maximum Reynolds
number considered in this work reaches up to $4000$, which is larger than those

patient's hospital stay to monitor their health status. Tools for integrating
these measurements into severity scores, that accurately track changes in
illness severity, can improve clinicians ability to provide timely
interventions. Existing approaches for creating such scores either 1) rely on
experts to fully specify the severity score, or 2) train a predictive score,
using supervised learning, by regressing against a surrogate marker of severity
such as the presence of downstream adverse events. The first approach does not
extend to diseases where an accurate score cannot be elicited from experts. The
second approach often produces scores that suffer from bias due to
treatment-related censoring (Paxton, 2013). We propose a novel ranking based
framework for disease severity score learning (DSSL). DSSL exploits the
following key observation: while it is challenging for experts to quantify the
disease severity at any given time, it is often easy to compare the disease
severity at two different times. Extending existing ranking algorithms, DSSL
learns a function that maps a vector of patient's measurements to a scalar
severity score such that the resulting score is temporally smooth and
consistent with the expert's ranking of pairs of disease states. We apply DSSL
to the problem of learning a sepsis severity score using a large, real-world
dataset. The learned scores significantly outperform state-of-the-art clinical
scores in ranking patient states by severity and in early detection of future
adverse events. We also show that the learned disease severity trajectories are
consistent with clinical expectations of disease evolution. Further, using
simulated datasets, we show that DSSL exhibits better generalization
performance to changes in treatment patterns compared to the above approaches.

More precisely we want to consider, for gravitating systems, how to best
describe energy-momentum and angular momentum/center-of-mass momentum (CoMM).
It is known that these quantities cannot be given by a local density. The
modern understanding is that (i) they are quasi-local (associated with a closed
2-surface), (ii) they have no unique formula, (iii) they have no reference
frame independent description. In the first part of this work we review some
early history, much of it not so well known, on the subject of gravitational
energy in Einstein's general relativity (GR), noting especially Noether's
contribution. In the second part we review (including some new results) much of
our covariant Hamiltonian formalism and apply it to Poincar\'e gauge theories
(GR is a special case). The key point is that the Hamiltonian boundary term has
two roles, it determines the quasi-local quantities, and, furthermore it
determines the boundary conditions for the dynamical variables. Energy-momentum
and angular momentum/CoMM are associated with the geometric symmetries under
Poincar\'e transformations. They are best described in a local Poincar\'e gauge
theory. The type of spacetime that naturally has this symmetry is
Riemann-Cartan spacetime, with a metric compatible connection having, in
general, both curvature and torsion. Thus our expression for the
energy-momentum of physical systems is obtained via our covariant Hamiltonian
formulation applied to Poincar\'e gauge theories.

for random variation and develop a general bivariate distribution to reflect

the exponential and the normal are special cases of a single distribution

field component, which turns a stable prolate configuration into an unstable
one. We refine previous models of this process by modelling the star's magnetic
field self-consistently as a 'twisted torus' configuration in non-barotropic
equilibrium (which allows us to explore a greater range of equilibrium
configurations). It is shown that, if the star's magnetic field is purely
dipolar, the change in the toroidal field strength required to produce an
anti-glitch of the observed size can be ~ 10 times larger than previously
calculated. If the star has a quadrupolar magnetic field component, then an
anti-glitch of similar magnitude can be produced via a decay of the quadrupole
component, in addition to a decay of the toroidal component. We show that, if
the quadrupole component decays, the minimum initial toroidal field strength
and the change in toroidal field strength needed to produce the observed
anti-glitch are lower than in the pure dipole twisted torus. In addition, we
predict the maximum anti-glitch sizes, assuming that they are caused by a
change in ellipticity, in four glitching magnetars and discuss the implications

to understand the genesis of extracellular potentials, as well as for

nature of these extracellular properties is still uncertain. We introduce a
method to measure the impedance of the tissue, and which preserves the intact
cell-medium interface, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vivo and in
vitro. We find that neural tissue has marked non-ohmic and frequency-filtering
properties, which are not consistent with a resistive (ohmic) medium, as often

different results, more consistent with a resistive medium. The amplitude and
phase profiles of the measured impedance are consistent with the contribution
of ionic diffusion. We also show that the impact of such frequency-filtering
properties is possibly important on the genesis of local field potentials, as
well as on the cable properties of neurons. The present results show non-ohmic
properties of the extracellular medium around neurons, and suggest that source
estimation methods, as well as the cable properties of neurons, which all
assume ohmic extracellular medium, may need to be re-evaluated.

black holes throughout the history of the Universe by a statistical approach
based on the continuity equation and the abundance matching technique.
Specifically, we present analytical solutions of the continuity equation
without source term to reconstruct the supermassive black hole (BH) mass
function from the AGN luminosity functions. Such an approach includes
physically-motivated AGN lightcurves tested on independent datasets, which
describe the evolution of the Eddington ratio and radiative efficiency from
slim- to thin-disc conditions. We nicely reproduce the local estimates of the
BH mass function, the AGN duty cycle as a function of mass and redshift, along
with the Eddington ratio function and the fraction of galaxies with given
stellar mass hosting an AGN with given Eddington ratio. We exploit the same
approach to reconstruct the observed stellar mass function at different
redshift from the UV and far-IR luminosity functions associated to star
formation in galaxies. These results imply that the buildup of stars and BHs in
galaxies occurs via in-situ processes, with dry mergers playing a marginal role
at least for stellar masses < 3 10^11 M_sun and BH masses < 10^9 M_sun, where
the statistical data are more secure and less biased by systematic errors. In
addition, we develop an improved abundance matching technique to link the
stellar and BH content of galaxies to the gravitationally dominant dark matter
component. The resulting relationships constitute a testbed for galaxy
evolution models, highlighting the complementary role of stellar and AGN
feedback in the star formation process. Finally, the clustering properties of
BHs and galaxies are found to be in full agreement with current observations,
so further validating our results from the continuity equation.

subject to dephasing, for rather general initial states with nonuniform

two parts of different nature, a dephasing-modified geometric part weighted by
initial Bloch state populations, and an interband-coherence-induced part
compromised by dephasing, both of them being independent of the pumping time
scale. The overall pumping reflects an interplay of the band topology, initial

water nucleation, using up to $\sim 4\cdot 10^6$ molecules. Our large system
sizes allow us to measure extremely low and accurate nucleation rates, down to
$\sim 10^{19}\,\textrm{cm}^{-3}\textrm{s}^{-1}$, helping close the gap between
experimentally measured rates $\sim 10^{17}\,\textrm{cm}^{-3}\textrm{s}^{-1}$.
We are also able to precisely measure size distributions, sticking
efficiencies, cluster temperatures, and cluster internal densities. We
introduce a new functional form to implement the Yasuoka-Matsumoto nucleation
rate measurement technique (threshold method). Comparison to nucleation models
shows that classical nucleation theory over-estimates nucleation rates by a few
orders of magnitude. The semi-phenomenological nucleation model does better,
under-predicting rates by at worst, a factor of 24. Unlike what has been
observed in Lennard-Jones simulations, post-critical clusters have temperatures
consistent with the run average temperature. Also, we observe that
post-critical clusters have densities very slightly higher, $\sim 5\%$, than
bulk liquid. We re-calibrate a Hale-type $J$ vs. $S$ scaling relation using
both experimental and simulation data, finding remarkable consistency in over
$30$ orders of magnitude in the nucleation rate range, and $180\,$K in the

existing set of models for low mass AGB stars (1.3<=M/M<=3.0) already included

computed models from the Main Sequence up to the end of the AGB phase. Due to
less efficient third dredge up episodes, models with large core masses show
modest surface enhancements. The latter is due to the fact that the interpulse
phases are short and, then, Thermal Pulses are weak. Moreover, the high
temperature at the base of the convective envelope prevents it to deeply
penetrate the radiative underlying layers. Depending on the initial stellar
mass, the heavy elements nucleosynthesis is dominated by different neutron
sources. In particular, the s-process distributions of the more massive models
are dominated by the \nean~reaction, which is efficiently activated during
Thermal Pulses. At low metallicities, our models undergo hot bottom burning and
hot third dredge up. We compare our theoretical final core masses to available
white dwarf observations. Moreover, we quantify the weight that intermediate
mass models have on the carbon stars luminosity function. Finally, we present
the upgrade of the FRUITY web interface, now also including the physical

modeled as a closely packed monolayer of fixed particles, resulting in a rough
wall rather than a geometrically smooth wall. An implicit assumption is that
the resulting rough wall differs from a smooth wall only locally at the
particle scale. Here we test this assumption by considering the impact of the
wall roughness at the periphery of the flowing layer on the flow of
monodisperse particles in a rotating spherical tumbler. We find that varying
the wall roughness significantly alters average particle trajectories even far
from the wall. Rough walls induce greater poleward axial drift of particles
near the flowing layer surface, but decrease the curvature of the trajectories.
Increasing the volume fill level in the tumbler has little effect on the axial
drift for rough walls, but increases the drift while reducing curvature of the
particle trajectories for smooth walls. The mechanism for these effects is
related to the degree of local slip at the bounding wall, which alters the
flowing layer thickness near the walls, affecting the particle trajectories
even far from the walls near the equator of the tumbler. Thus, the proper
choice of wall conditions is important in the accurate simulation of granular
flows, even far from the bounding wall.

For the sake of comparison, we compute the ratio for bipolar magnetic fields

potential and non-linear force-free field models. We demonstrate that the ratio
of the plasma frequency to the gyrofrequency for electrons can be estimated by
this novel method combining magnetic field extrapolation techniques and
hydrodynamic models. Even if statistically not significant, values of
$\omega_{pe}$/$\Omega_e$ $\leq$ 1 are present in all examples, and are located
in the low corona near to photosphere below one pressure scale-height and/or in
the vicinity of twisted flux bundles. The values of $\omega_{pe}$/$\Omega_e$
are lower for non-linear force-free fields than potential fields, thus
increasing the possibility of maser instability in the corona. From this new
approach for estimating $\omega_{pe}$/$\Omega_e$, we conclude that the electron

importance of the maser instability in coronal active regions depends on the

Our spectroscopy was complemented with HST/ACS imaging in the F814W filter. We
analyzed the ionized gas kinematics by extracting rotation curves from the 2-D

effects, these rotation curves were used to derive the intrinsic Vmax.
Neglecting galaxies with disturbed kinematics or insufficient spatial rotation
curve extent, Vmax could be robustly determined for 124 galaxies covering
redshifts 0.05<z<0.97. This is one of the largest kinematic samples of distant
disk galaxies to date. We compared this data set to the local B-band
Tully-Fisher relation and the local velocity-size relation. The scatter in both
scaling relations is a factor of ~2 larger at z~0.5 than at z~0. The deviations
of individual distant galaxies from the local Tully-Fisher relation are
systematic in the sense that the galaxies are increasingly overluminous towards
higher redshifts, corresponding to an over-luminosity of -(1.2+-0.5) mag at
z=1. This luminosity evolution at given Vmax is probably driven by younger
stellar populations of distant galaxies with respect to their local
counterparts, potentially combined with modest changes in dark matter mass
fractions. The analysis of the velocity-size relation reveals that disk
galaxies of a given Vmax have grown in size by a factor of ~1.5 over the past
~8 Gyr, likely via accretion of cold gas and/or small satellites. Scrutinizing
the combined evolution in luminosity and size, we find that the galaxies which
show the strongest evolution towards smaller sizes at z~1 are not those which
feature the strongest evolution in luminosity, and vice versa. [abstract

upflow events (MUEs) from high-quality, high- (spatial, temporal, and spectral)
resolution, and full Stokes observations in four photospheric magnetically
sensitive Fe I lines centered at 525.021, 617.334, 630.151, and 630.250 nm
acquired with the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST)/CRISP. We detect MUEs by
subtracting in-line Stokes V signals from those in far blue wing whose
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) >= 7. We find a larger number of MUEs at any given
time (0.02 per square arcsec), larger by one to two orders of magnitude, than
previously reported. The MUEs appear to fall into four classes presenting
different shapes of Stokes V profiles with (I) asymmetric double lobes, (II)
single lobes, (III) double-humped (two same-polarity lobes), and (IV) three
lobes (an extra blue-shifted bump in addition to double-lobes), of which less
than half are single-lobed. We also find that MUEs are almost equally
distributed in network and internetwork areas and they appear in the interior
or at the edge of granules in both regions. Distributions of physical
properties, except that of horizontal velocity, of the MUEs (namely, Stokes V
signal, size, line-of-sight velocity, and lifetime) are almost identical for
the different spectral lines in our data. A bisector analysis of our spectrally
resolved observations shows that these events host modest upflows and do not
show direct indication of the presence of supersonic upflows reported earlier.
Our findings reveal that numbers, types (classes), and properties determined
for MUEs can strongly depend on the detection techniques used and the
properties of the employed data, namely, S/Ns, resolutions, and wavelengths.

theory to Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ to analyze those physical quantities obtained
experimentally, focusing on the interplay between the strong two-dimensional
anisotropy and the Pauli paramagnetic effects. This study allows us to
understand the origin of the disparity between the vortex lattice anisotropy
($\sim$60) and the $H_{\rm c2}$ anisotropy ($\sim$20). Among the three bands;
$\gamma$ with the effective mass anisotropy $\sim$180, $\alpha$ with $\sim$120,
and $\beta$ with $\sim$60, the last one is found to be the major band,
responsible for various magnetic responses while the minor $\gamma$ band plays
an important role in the vortex formation. Namely, in a field orientation
slightly tilted away from the two dimensional basal plane those two bands
cooperatively form the optimal vortex anisotropy which exceeds that given by
the effective mass formula with infinite anisotropy. This is observed by small
angle neutron scattering experiments on Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. The pairing symmetry of
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ realized is either spin singlet or spin triplet with the d-vector
strongly locked in the basal plane. The gap structure is that the major $\beta$
band has a full gap and the minor $\gamma$ band has a $d_{x^2-y^2}$ like gap.

demonstrated that the average grain size was reduced from $\sim {~}$1.5 $\mu m$
to $\sim {~}$200 $nm$ with the increase in Ti content. Due to Ti substitution,
the dielectric constant was stable over a wide range of high frequencies (30
kHz to 20 MHz) by suppressing the dispersion at low frequencies. The dielectric
properties of the compounds are associated with their improved morphologies and
reduced leakage current densities probably due to the lower concentration of
oxygen vacancies in the compositions. Magnetic properties of
Bi$_{0.9}$Gd$_{0.1}$Fe$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_3$ (x = 0.00-0.25) ceramics measured at

enhanced magnetic properties might be attributed to the substitution induced
suppression of spiral spin structure of BiFeO$_3$. An asymmetric shifts both in
the field and magnetization axes of magnetization versus magnetic field (M-H)
curves was observed. This indicates the presence of exchange bias effect in
these compounds notably at room temperature.

sector in terms of a single component. They however face problems when
attempting to account for structure formation: in the linear regime, density
fluctuations can become Jeans stable and oscillate rather than collapse, though
it is possible that this difficulty may be circumvented by invoking nonlinear
clustering. Here we examine the behaviour in the fully nonlinear regime, of
collapsed objects that should mimic standard dark matter haloes. It is shown
that the pressure gradient associated with the unified dark matter fluid should
be significant in the outer parts of galaxies and clusters, and its effects
obervable. In this case, no flat or falling rotation curve is possible for any
(barotropic) equation of state with associated sound speed decreasing with
density (a necessary condition if the fluid is to behave as pressureless matter
at high density). The associated density profile is therefore also incompatible
with that inferred in the outer part of clusters. For the prototypical case of
the generalised Chaplygin gas, it is shown that this limits the values of the
equation of state index $\alpha$ that are compatible with observations to
$\alpha \la 0.0001$ or $\alpha \ga 2$. This is in line from what is deduced
from linear analysis. More generally, from the expected properties of dark
matter haloes, constraints on the sound speed are derived. For the particular
case of the generalised Chaplygin gas, this further constrains the index to
$\alpha \la 10^{-9}$ or $\alpha \ga 6.7$. For a unified dark matter fluid to
mimic dark halo properties, therefore, it needs to have an equation of state
such that the pressure gradients are either minimal or which decrease fast
enough so as to be negligible at densities characteristic of the outer parts of
haloes.

oscillations in the chromosphere above sunspot umbrae. The steep temperature
gradients at the photosphere and transition region provide the cavity for the
acoustic resonator, which allows waves to be both partially transmitted and
partially reflected. In this paper, a new method of estimating the size and
temperature profile of the chromospheric cavity above a sunspot umbra is
developed. The magnetic field above umbrae is modelled numerically in 1.5D with
slow magnetoacoustic wave trains travelling along magnetic fieldlines.
Resonances are driven by applying the random noise of three different
colours---white, pink and brown---as small velocity perturbations to the upper
convection zone. Energy escapes the resonating cavity and generates wave trains
moving into the corona. Line of sight (LOS) integration is also performed to
determine the observable spectra through SDO/AIA. The numerical results show
that the gradient of the coronal spectra is directly correlated with the
chromosperic temperature configuration. As the chromospheric cavity size
increases, the spectral gradient becomes shallower. When LOS integrations is
performed, the resulting spectra demonstrate a broadband of excited frequencies
that is correlated with the chromospheric cavity size. The broadband of excited
frequencies becomes narrower as the chromospheric cavity size increases. These
two results provide a potentially useful diagnostic for the chromospheric
temperature profile by considering coronal velocity oscillations.

this descent direction. Convergence of the algorithms is proved and the rate of
convergence is analysed under the Lojasiewicz property of the objective
function. We apply our algorithms to a class of smooth DC programs arising in
the study of biochemical reaction networks, where the objective function is
real analytic and thus satisfies the Lojasiewicz property. Numerical tests on
various biochemical models clearly show that our algorithms outperforms DCA,
being on average more than four times faster in both computational time and the
number of iterations. Numerical experiments show that the algorithms are
globally convergent to a non-equilibrium steady state of various biochemical
networks, with only chemically consistent restrictions on the network topology.

mass-fractal iterations of the same fractal dimension. Within this assertion,
the scattering amplitude of surface fractal is shown to be a sum of the
amplitudes of composing mass fractals. Various approximations for the
scattering intensity of surface fractal are considered. It is shown that
small-angle scattering (SAS) from a surface fractal can be explained in terms
of power-law distribution of sizes of objects composing the fractal (internal
polydispersity), provided the distance between objects is much larger than
their size for each composing mass fractal. The power-law decay of the
scattering intensity $I(q) \propto q^{D_{\mathrm{s}}-6}$, where $2 <
D_{\mathrm{s}} < 3$ is the surface fractal dimension of the system, is realized
as a non-coherent sum of scattering amplitudes of three-dimensional objects
composing the fractal and obeying a power-law distribution $d N(r) \propto
r^{-\tau} dr$, with $D_{\mathrm{s}}=\tau-1$. The distribution is continuous for
random fractals and discrete for deterministic fractals. We suggest a model of
surface deterministic fractal, the surface Cantor-like fractal, which is a sum
of three-dimensional Cantor dusts at various iterations, and study its
scattering properties. The present analysis allows us to extract additional
information from SAS data, such us the edges of the fractal region, the fractal
iteration number and the scaling factor.

permanent figures. Unlike planets with solid mantles and Earth-like rheology,
semiliquid bodies can be captured into stable pseudosynchronous spin resonance,
where the average rate of rotation is higher than the synchronous 1:1
resonance. Two basic conditions are derived for capture of planets with a
triaxial figure into pseudosynchronous rotation, one related to the
characteristic tidal wave number (the product of the tidal frequency by the
Maxwell time), and the other to the orbital eccentricity. If a semiliquid
object does not satisfy either of the two conditions, it is captured into the
synchronous resonance. For nearly axially symmetric bodies, only the first
condition is in place, and the other is much relaxed, so they should

  We consider the one-dimensional (1D) spin-1/2 XY model in a magnetic field.
Using the fermionization approach, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian of the
system. Then, we provide the analytical results for entanglement between the
2nd, 3rd and 4th neighbor (denoted as 2N, 3N, and 4N respectively) spins. We
find a magnetic entanglement that starts from a critical entangled-field
($h_c^{E}$) at zero temperature. The critical entangled-field depends on the
distance between the spins. In addition to the analytical results, the
mentioned phenomenon is confirmed by the numerical Lanczos calculations. By
adding the temperature to the model, the magnetic entanglement remains stable
up to a critical temperature, $T_c$. Our results show that entanglement spreads
step by step to farther neighbors in the spin chain by reducing temperature. At
first, the 1N spins are entangled and then further neighbors will be entangled
respectively. $T_c$ depends on the value of the magnetic field and will be
maximized at the quantum critical field.

bounds on radio localization precision of far-field Received Signal Strength

measurements time-averaged over periods long compared to the coherence time of
the radiation. Our experiments are performed in a novel localization setup
using 2.4GHz quasi-monochromatic radiation, which corresponds to a mean
wavelength of 12.5cm. We experimentally and theoretically show that RSS
measurements are cross-correlated over a minimum distance that approaches the
diffraction limit, which equals half the mean wavelength of the radiation. Our
experiments show that measuring RSS beyond a sampling density of one sample per
half the mean wavelength does not increase localization precision, as the
Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) converges asymptotically to roughly half the
mean wavelength. This adds to the evidence that the diffraction limit
determines (1) the lower bound on localization precision and (2) the sampling
density that provides optimal localization precision. We experimentally
validate the theoretical relations between Fisher information, Cram\'er-Rao
Lower Bound (CRLB) and uncertainty, where uncertainty is lower bounded by
diffraction as derived from coherence and speckle theory. When we reconcile
Fisher Information with diffraction, the CRLB matches the experimental results

modelling the multi-target state as a generalised labelled multi-Bernoulli

using gamma Gaussian inverse Wishart (GGIW) distributions. A cheaper variant of
the algorithm is also proposed, based on the labelled multi-Bernoulli (LMB)

  gap","17 pages",,,,"cs.IT math.IT math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work addresses the question of achieving capacity with lattice codes in
multi-antenna block fading channels when the number of fading blocks tends to
infinity. A design criterion based on the normalized minimum determinant is
proposed for division algebra multiblock space-time codes over fading channels;
this plays a similar role to the Hermite invariant for Gaussian channels. It is
shown that this criterion is sufficient to guarantee transmission rates within
a constant gap from capacity both for slow fading channels and ergodic fading
channels. This performance is achieved both under maximum likelihood decoding
and naive lattice decoding. In the case of independent identically distributed
Rayleigh fading, it is also shown that the error probability vanishes
exponentially fast. In contrast to the standard approach in the literature
which employs random lattice ensembles, the existence results in this paper are
derived from number theory. First the gap to capacity is shown to depend on the
discriminant of the chosen division algebra; then class field theory is applied
to build families of algebras with small discriminants. The key element in the
construction is the choice of a sequence of division algebras whose centers are
number fields with small root discriminants.

  Hyper Edges",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Makespan minimization in restricted assignment $(R|p_{ij}\in \{p_j,
\infty\}|C_{\max})$ is a classical problem in the field of machine scheduling.
In a landmark paper in 1990 [8], Lenstra, Shmoys, and Tardos gave a
2-approximation algorithm and proved that the problem cannot be approximated
within 1.5 unless P=NP. The upper and lower bounds of the problem have been
essentially unimproved in the intervening 25 years, despite several remarkable
successful attempts in some special cases of the problem [2,4,12] recently.
  In this paper, we consider a special case called graph-balancing with light
hyper edges, where heavy jobs can be assigned to at most two machines while
light jobs can be assigned to any number of machines. For this case, we present
algorithms with approximation ratios strictly better than 2. Specifically,
  Two job sizes: Suppose that light jobs have weight $w$ and heavy jobs have
weight $W$, and $w < W$. We give a $1.5$-approximation algorithm (note that the
current 1.5 lower bound is established in an even more restrictive setting
[1,3]). Indeed, depending on the specific values of $w$ and $W$, sometimes our
algorithm guarantees sub-1.5 approximation ratios.
  Arbitrary job sizes: Suppose that $W$ is the largest given weight, heavy jobs
have weights in the range of $(\beta W, W]$, where $4/7\leq \beta < 1$, and
light jobs have weights in the range of $(0,\beta W]$. We present a
$(5/3+\beta/3)$-approximation algorithm.
  Our algorithms are purely combinatorial, without the need of solving a linear
program as required in most other known approaches.

frequencies in a nearly-integrable Hamiltonian system, whose hyperbolic part is
given by a pendulum, is studied. We consider a torus with a fast frequency
vector $\omega/\sqrt\varepsilon$, with $\omega=(1,\Omega)$ where the frequency
ratio $\Omega$ is a quadratic irrational number. Applying the
Poincar\'e-Melnikov method, we carry out a careful study of the dominant
harmonics of the Melnikov potential. This allows us to provide an asymptotic
estimate for the maximal splitting distance, and show the existence of
transverse homoclinic orbits to the whiskered tori with an asymptotic estimate
for the transversality of the splitting. Both estimates are exponentially small
in $\varepsilon$, with the functions in the exponents being periodic with
respect to $\ln\varepsilon$, and can be explicitly constructed from the
continued fraction of $\Omega$. In this way, we emphasize the strong dependence
of our results on the arithmetic properties of $\Omega$. In particular, for
quadratic ratios $\Omega$ with a 1-periodic or 2-periodic continued fraction
(called metallic and metallic-colored ratios respectively), we provide accurate
upper and lower bounds for the splitting. The estimate for the maximal
splitting distance is valid for all sufficiently small values of $\varepsilon$,
and the transversality can be established for a majority of values of
$\varepsilon$, excluding small intervals around some transition values where
changes in the dominance of the harmonics take place, and bifurcations could
occur.

  This achieves an approximation ratio of $1 + \frac{\ln

additional constraints on the variable sizes, we show an approximation ratio of
$\ln \Delta_0 + O(\log \log \Delta_0)$ (where $\Delta_0$ is the maximum number
of non-zero entries in any column of the covering matrix). These results
improve asymptotically, in several different ways, over results of Srinivasan

one which is equal to the local twisted theta representation at almost all

the physics of Kondo screening. Traditional numerical renormalization group
(NRG) calculation of the impurity contribution $\chi_{\textrm{imp}}$ to
susceptibility, defined originally by Wilson in a flat wide band, has been
generalized before to structured conduction bands. The results brought about
non-Fermi-liquid and diamagnetic Kondo behaviors in $\chi_{\textrm{imp}}$, even
when the bands are not gapped at the Fermi energy. Here, we use the full
density-matrix (FDM) NRG to present high-quality data for the local
susceptibility $\chi_{\textrm{loc}}$ and to compare them with
$\chi_{\textrm{imp}}$ obtained by the traditional NRG. Our results indicate
that those exotic behaviors observed in $\chi_{\textrm{imp}}$ are unphysical.
Instead, the low-energy excitations of the impurity in arbitrary bands only
without gap at the Fermi energy are still a Fermi liquid and paramagnetic. We
also demonstrate that unlike the traditional NRG yielding $\chi_{\textrm{loc}}$
less accurate than $\chi_{\textrm{imp}}$, the FDM method allows a
high-precision dynamical calculation of $\chi_{\textrm{loc}}$ at much reduced
computational cost, with an accuracy at least one order higher than
$\chi_{\textrm{imp}}$. Moreover, artifacts in the FDM algorithm to
$\chi_{\textrm{imp}}$, and origins of the spurious non-Fermi-liquid and
diamagnetic features are clarified. Our work provides an efficient
high-precision algorithm to calculate the spin susceptibility of impurity for
arbitrary structured bands, while negating the applicability of Wilson's
definition to such cases.

night over a two-month interval around the photometric minimum of $\eta$ Car
associated with the periastron passage of a hot companion. The photoionizing
flux of the companion and heating related to colliding winds causes large
changes in the wind properties of the massive primary star. Here we present an
analysis of temporal variations in a sample of spectral lines that are clearly
formed in the wind of the primary star. These lines are affected by a changing
illumination of the flux of the secondary star during the periastron passage.
We document the sudden onset of blue-shifted absorption that occurred in most
of the lines near or slightly after periastron, and we argue that these
absorption components are seen when we view the relatively undisturbed wind of
the foreground primary star. We present time series measurements of the net
equivalent width of the wind lines and of the radial velocities of the
absorption trough minima and the emission peak midpoints. Most lines decrease
in emission strength around periastron, and those high excitation lines formed
close to the primary exhibit a red-ward velocity excursion. We show how these
trends can be explained using an illuminated hemisphere model that is based on
the idea that the emission originates primarily from the side of the primary
facing the hot companion.

golden rule is used in order to calculate the transition rate from an initial

can calculate the total transition rate from all initial states to all final
states with Boltzmann rate equations involving Brillouin zone integrations. The
numerical treatment of these integrations on a finite grid is often done via a
replacement of the Dirac delta distribution by a Gaussian. The Dirac delta
distribution appears in Fermi's golden rule where it describes the energy
conservation among the interacting particles. Since the Dirac delta

minimal coupling, is also coupled through a non-minimal derivative coupling
with the torsion scalar which is the teleparallel equivalent of Einstein
gravity. This theory provides second order equations of motion and we find
large-distance non-perturbative static spherically symmetric four-dimensional
solutions. Among them a general class of black hole solutions is found for some
range of the parameters/integration constants with asymptotics of the form of
hyperscaling violating Lifshitz spacetime with spherical horizon topology.
Although the scalar field diverges at the horizon, its energy density and
pressures are finite there. From the astrophysical point of view, this solution
provides extra deflection of light compared to the Newtonian deflection.

understanding several important factorization invariants, including length

accelerated by the use of computer algebra systems, many existing algorithms
are computationally infeasible for numerical monoids with several irreducible
elements. In this paper, we present dynamic algorithms for the factorization
set, length set, delta set, and $\omega$-primality in numerical monoids and
demonstrate that these algorithms give significant improvements in runtime and

$\omega$-primality, we extend the usual definition of this invariant to the
quotient group of the monoid and show that several useful results naturally
extend to this broader setting.

new family of infinitely many multi-parametric entropies. We shall call them
the $Z$-entropies. Each of them, under suitable hypotheses, generalizes the
celebrated entropies of Boltzmann and R\'enyi.
  A crucial aspect is that every $Z$-entropy is composable [1]. This property
means that the entropy of a system which is composed of two or more independent
systems depends, in all the associated probability space, on the choice of the
two systems only. Further properties are also required, to describe the
composition process in terms of a group law.
  The composability axiom, introduced as a generalization of the fourth
Shannon-Khinchin axiom (postulating additivity), is a highly non-trivial
requirement. Indeed, in the trace-form class, the Boltzmann entropy and Tsallis
entropy are the only known composable cases. However, in the non-trace form
class, the $Z$-entropies arise as new entropic functions possessing the
mathematical properties necessary for information-theoretical applications, in
both classical and quantum contexts.
  From a mathematical point of view, composability is intimately related to
formal group theory of algebraic topology. The underlying group-theoretical
structure determines crucially the statistical properties of the corresponding
entropies.

scattering media to enable broadband and wide-angle enhancement. However, such
systems are often opaque, making it difficult to probe photo-induced processes.
Here we use wave interference effects to modify the spatial distribution of
light inside a highly-scattering dye-sensitized solar cell to control photon
absorption in a space-dependent manner. By shaping the incident wavefront of a
laser beam, we enhance or suppress photocurrent by increasing or decreasing
light concentration on the front side of the mesoporous photoanode where the
collection efficiency of photoelectrons is maximal. Enhanced light absorption
is achieved by reducing reflection through the open boundary of the photoanode
via destructive interference, leading to a factor of two increase in
photocurrent. This approach opens the door to probing and manipulating
photoelectrochemical processes in specific regions inside nominally opaque

multiplicative cascade notion in the multifractal formalism and in this
approach $L_0$ represents a benchmark to describe the nature of
cross-correlation between two series. The analysis of the petrophysical
quantities revealed that GR for all wells has strongly multifractal nature due
to the considerable abundance of large fluctuations in various scales. The
variance of probability distribution function, $\lambda_{\ell}^2$, at scale
$\ell$ and its intercept determine the multifractal properties of the data sets
sourced by probability density function. The value of $\lambda_0 ^2$ for NPHI
data set is less than GR's, however, DT shows a nearly monofractal behavior,
namely $\lambda_0 ^2\rightarrow 0$, so we find that $\lambda_0^2({\rm

Hurst exponents can not discriminate between series GR, NPHI and DT. Joint
analysis of the petrophysical quantities for considered wells demonstrates that
$L_0$ has negative value for GR-NPHI confirming that finding shaly layers is in
competition with finding porous medium while it takes positive value for GR-DT
determining that continuum medium can be detectable by evaluating the

candidate for dark matter (DM) is now the lightest neutralino with mass around
1 TeV and with well defined properties (a nearly pure higgsino). This follows
primarily from a combination of the properties of the discovered Higgs boson,
in particular its mass close to 125 Gev, and the relic density of dark matter,
and is most clearly visible in the context of unified, or constrained, SUSY
frameworks, although the DM candidate is quite generic; (b) this DM candidate
will be nearly fully tested in forthcoming one-tonne DM underground search
detectors; (c) the CMSSM will be nearly fully tested in the next few years by a
combination of expected data from LHC experiments and from direct DM searches,
as well as potentially also by the Cherenkov Telescope Array; (d) if
naturalness plays any real role in SUSY (which remains unclear), then the
amount of fine tuning, which is very large in simple models like the CMSSM, can
be significantly reduced (even down to 1 in 20) with properly selected boundary
conditions at the unification scale; (e) the (g-2) muon anomaly can be
accommodated not only in the context of the general MSSM but also of some
unified SUSY models with some superpartners to be within reach of the LHC.

of a population of M individuals undergoing random mutations and selection, and
that of a single system in contact with a thermal bath with temperature 1/M.
This correspondence holds under the somewhat restrictive condition that the
population is dominated by a single type at almost all times, punctuated by
rare successive mutations. Here we argue that such thermal dynamics will hold
more generally, specifically in systems with rugged fitness landscapes. This
includes cases with strong clonal interference, where a number of concurrent
mutants dominate the population. The problem becomes closely analogous to the
experimental situation of glasses subjected to controlled variations of
parameters such as temperature, pressure or magnetic fields. Non-trivial
suggestions from the field of glasses may be thus proposed for evolutionary
systems - including a large part of the numerical simulation procedures - that
in many cases would have been counter intuitive without this background.

simulation of the full non-linear problem, in the context of magnetar activity.
We confirm the development of the instability of a plane-parallel magnetic
field with an appropriate intensity and electron density profile, in accordance
with analytic theory. We find that the instability also appears for a
monotonically decreasing electron number density and magnetic field, a
plane-parallel analogue of an azimuthal or meridional magnetic field in the
crust of a magnetar. The growth rate of the instability depends on the Hall
properties of the field (magnetic field intensity, electron number density and
the corresponding scale-heights), while being insensitive to weak resistivity.
Since the Hall effect is the driving process for the evolution of the crustal
magnetic field of magnetars, we argue that this instability is critical for
systems containing strong meridional or azimuthal fields. We find that this
process mediates the formation of localised structures with much stronger
magnetic field than the average, which can lead to magnetar activity and
accelerate the dissipation of the field and consequently the production of
Ohmic heating. Assuming a $5\times10^{14}$G magnetic field at the base of
crust, we anticipate that magnetic field as strong as $10^{15}$G will easily
develop in regions of typical size of a few $10^{2}$ meters, containing
magnetic energy of $10^{43}$erg, sufficient to power magnetar bursts. These
active regions are more likely to appear in the magnetic equator where the
tangential magnetic field is stronger.

average along the vertical lines of such a function satisfies the Law of
Iterated Logarithm (LIL). We extend this result to a class of Lipschitz domains
in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In particular, we obtain the local version of this LIL

averages by a Bloch function, satisfying some additional condition determined
by the weight $w$. The growth rate of such Bloch function depends on $w$ and,
for slowly increasing $w$, turns out to be slower than the one provided by LILs
of Makarov and Llorente. We discuss the necessary condition for an arbitrary
Bloch function to exhibit this type of behaviour.

automated methods for exploiting video surveillance data including scene
understanding, query, behaviour annotation and summarization. For this reason,
extensive research has been performed on surveillance scene understanding and
analysis. However, most studies have considered single scenes, or groups of
adjacent scenes. The semantic similarity between different but related scenes
(e.g., many different traffic scenes of similar layout) is not generally
exploited to improve any automated surveillance tasks and reduce manual effort.
Exploiting commonality, and sharing any supervised annotations, between
different scenes is however challenging due to: Some scenes are totally
un-related -- and thus any information sharing between them would be
detrimental; while others may only share a subset of common activities -- and
thus information sharing is only useful if it is selective. Moreover,
semantically similar activities which should be modelled together and shared
across scenes may have quite different pixel-level appearance in each scene. To
address these issues we develop a new framework for distributed multiple-scene
global understanding that clusters surveillance scenes by their ability to
explain each other's behaviours; and further discovers which subset of
activities are shared versus scene-specific within each cluster. We show how to
use this structured representation of multiple scenes to improve common
surveillance tasks including scene activity understanding, cross-scene
query-by-example, behaviour classification with reduced supervised labelling
requirements, and video summarization. In each case we demonstrate how our
multi-scene model improves on a collection of standard single scene models and
a flat model of all scenes.

independent set problem. In this thesis we study the k-set packing problem
where given a universe U and a collection C of subsets over U, each of
cardinality k, one needs to find the maximum collection of mutually disjoint
subsets. Local search techniques have proved to be successful in the search for
approximation algorithms, both for the unweighted and the weighted version of
the problem where every subset in C is associated with a weight and the
objective is to maximise the sum of the weights. We make a survey of these
approaches and give some background and intuition behind them. In particular,
we simplify the algebraic proof of the main lemma for the currently best
weighted approximation algorithm of Berman ([Ber00]) into a proof that reveals
more intuition on what is really happening behind the math. The main result is
a new bound of k/3 + 1 + epsilon on the integrality gap for a polynomially
sized LP relaxation for k-set packing by Chan and Lau ([CL10]) and the natural
SDP relaxation [NOTE: see page iii]. We provide detailed proofs of lemmas
needed to prove this new bound and treat some background on related topics like
semidefinite programming and the Lovasz Theta function. Finally we have an
extended discussion in which we suggest some possibilities for future research.

understanding of the apparent irreversibility of the macroscopic world is well
grounded in the notion of entropy. Because astrophysics deals with the largest
structures in the Universe, one expects evidence there for the most pronounced
entropic arrow of time. However, in recent theoretical astrophysics work it
appears possible to identify constructs with time-reversal symmetry, which is
puzzling in the large-scale realm especially because it involves the engines of
powerful outflows in active galactic nuclei which deal with macroscopic
constituents such as accretion disks, magnetic fields, and black holes.
Nonetheless, the underlying theoretical structure from which this accreting
black hole framework emerges displays a time-symmetric harmonic behavior, a
feature reminiscent of basic and simple laws of physics. While we may expect
such behavior for classical black holes due to their simplicity, manifestations
of such symmetry on the scale of galaxies, instead, surprise. In fact, we
identify a parallel between the astrophysical tug-of-war between accretion
disks and jets in this model and the time symmetry-breaking of a simple
overdamped harmonic oscillator. The validity of these theoretical ideas in
combination with this unexpected parallel suggests that black holes are more
influential in astrophysics than currently recognized and that black hole
astrophysics is a more fundamental discipline.
