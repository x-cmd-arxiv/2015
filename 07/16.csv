types imposes new challenges in network planning and deployment of future
generation of cellular networks. The Radio Resource Management (RRM)
techniques, such as dynamic sharing of the available resources and advanced
user association strategies, determine the overall network capacity and
efficiency. This paper evaluates the downlink performance of a two tier
heterogeneous network (consisting of macro and femto tiers) in terms of rate
distribution, i.e. the percentage of users that achieve certain rate in the
system. The paper specifically addresses the femto tier RRM by randomization of
the allocated resources and the user association process by introducing a
modified SINR association strategy with bias factor for load balancing. Also,
the paper introduces hybrid access control mechanism at the femto tier that
allows the authorized users of the femtocell, which are part of the Closed
Subscriber Group (CSG) on the femtocell, to achieve higher data rates up to 10
times compared to the other regular users associated in the access.

PLATO to detect changes in planetary system architecture with time,

used all the observations made from the Gas Slit Camera on board MAXI of 4U
1538-52 covering many orbits continuously. We obtained the good interval times
for every orbital phase range which were the input to extract our data. We
estimated the orbital period of the system and then folded the light curves and
we fitted the X-ray spectra with the same model for every orbital phase
spectrum. We also extracted the averaged spectrum of all the MAXI data
available. The MAXI spectra in the 2-20 keV energy range were fitted with an
absorbed Comptonization of cool photons on hot electrons. We found a strong
orbital dependence of the absorption column density but neither the
fluorescence iron emission line nor low energy excess were needed to fit the
MAXI spectra. The variation of the spectral parameters over the binary orbit
were used to examine the mode of accretion onto the neutron star in 4U 1538-52.

universe. In these objects, most of the emission comes from relativistic jets
getting their power from the accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes.
However, despite the number of studies, a jet's acceleration to relativistic
speeds is still poorly understood.
  It is widely known that jets contain relativistic particles that emit
radiation through several physical processes, one of them being the inverse
Compton scattering of photons coming from external sources. In the case of a
plasma composed of electrons and positrons continuously heated by the
turbulence, inverse Compton scattering can lead to relativistic bulk motions
through the Compton rocket effect. We investigate this process and compute the
resulting bulk Lorentz factor in the complex photon field of an AGN composed of
several external photon sources.
  We consider various sources here: the accretion disk, the dusty torus, and
the broad line region. We take their geometry and anisotropy carefully into
account in order to numerically compute the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet at
every altitude.
  The study, made for a broad range of parameters, shows interesting and
unexpected behaviors of the bulk Lorentz factor, exhibiting acceleration and
deceleration zones in the jet. We investigate the patterns of the bulk Lorentz
factor along the jet depending on the source sizes and on the observation angle
and we finally show that these patterns can induce variability in the AGN
emission with timescales going from hours to months.

the Interface Region Spectrograph (IRIS) on 2013 September 2, from 16:40 to
17:59 UT. The downflow shows up as red-shifted ""satellite"" lines of the Si IV
and O IV transition region lines and is remarkably steady over the observing
period of nearly 80 min. The downflow is not visible in the chromospheric
lines, which only show an intensity enhancement at the location of the
downflow. The density inferred from the line ratio of the red-shifted
satellites of the O IV lines ($N_\mathrm{e} = 10^{10.6\pm0.25}

of the order of 10 s. We interpret these findings as evidence of a stationary

Second, for any amount of disorder, the average transmittance decays

of Armstrong (recently verified by Johnson) that the finitely many simultaneous
$(s,t)$-cores have average size $\frac{1}{24}(s-1)(t-1)(s+t+1)$, and that the
subset of self-conjugate cores has the same average (first shown by
Chen--Huang--Wang). We similarly prove a recent conjecture of Fayers that the
average weighted by an inverse stabilizer---giving the ""expected size of the
$t$-core of a random $s$-core""---is $\frac{1}{24}(s-1)(t^2-1)$. We also prove
Fayers' conjecture that the analogous self-conjugate average is the same if $t$
is odd, but instead $\frac{1}{24}(s-1)(t^2+2)$ if $t$ is even. In principle,
our explicit methods---or implicit variants thereof---extend to averages of
arbitrary powers.
  The main new observation is that the stabilizers appearing in Fayers'
conjectures have simple formulas in Johnson's $z$-coordinates parameterization
of $(s,t)$-cores.
  We also observe that the $z$-coordinates extend to parameterize general
$t$-cores. As an example application with $t := s+d$, we count the number of
$(s,s+d,s+2d)$-cores for coprime $s,d\ge1$, verifying a recent conjecture of
Amdeberhan and Leven.

sensory information channels. This information is then converted into a neural
code that represents the animal's current position in space by engaging place
cell, grid cell, and head direction cell networks. In particular, sensory
landmark (allothetic) cues can be utilized in concert with an animal's
knowledge of its own velocity (idiothetic) cues to generate a more accurate
representation of position than (idiothetic) path integration provides on its
own (Battaglia et al, 2004). We develop a computational model that merges path
integration with information from external sensory cues that provide a reliable
representation of spatial position along an annular track. Starting with a
continuous bump attractor model, we allow for the possibility of synaptic
spatial heterogeneity that would break the translation symmetry of space. We
use asymptotic analysis to reduce the bump attractor model to a single scalar
equation whose potential represents the impact of heterogeneity. Such
heterogeneity causes errors to build up when the network performs path
integration, but these errors can be corrected by an external control signal
representing the effects of sensory cues. We demonstrate that there is an
optimal strength and decay rate of the control signal when cues are placed both
periodically and randomly. A similar analysis is performed when errors in path
integration arise from dynamic noise fluctuations. Again, there is an optimal
strength and decay of discrete control that minimizes the path integration
error.

Locality-Sensitive Hashing schemes, recently used to design efficient solutions

matches the bound of $\rho\le \frac{1}{2c-1}+o(1)$ for the $\ell_1$ space,
obtained via the recent algorithm from [Andoni-Razenshteyn, STOC'15].
  In recent years it emerged that data-dependent hashing is strictly superior
to the classical Locality-Sensitive Hashing, when the hash function is
data-independent. In the latter setting, the best exponent has been already
known: for the $\ell_1$ space, the tight bound is $\rho=1/c$, with the upper
bound from [Indyk-Motwani, STOC'98] and the matching lower bound from
[O'Donnell-Wu-Zhou, ITCS'11].
  We prove that, even if the hashing is data-dependent, it must hold that
$\rho\ge \frac{1}{2c-1}-o(1)$. To prove the result, we need to formalize the
exact notion of data-dependent hashing that also captures the complexity of the
hash functions (in addition to their collision properties). Without restricting
such complexity, we would allow for obviously infeasible solutions such as the
Voronoi diagram of a dataset. To preclude such solutions, we require our hash
functions to be succinct. This condition is satisfied by all the known
algorithmic results.

galaxy type. We then compare our observations to measurements taken from the
Millennium Simulation, assuming different models of galaxy-halo misalignment.
Using the Millennium Simulation we verify that the statistical estimator used

the simulation, which we interpret as the impact of intrinsic shape-shear
alignments between the lenses and their large-scale structure environment.
These alignments are likely to have caused some of the previous observational
constraints on $f_\mathrm{h}$ to be biased high. From CFHTLenS we find
$f_\mathrm{h}=-0.04 \pm 0.25$ for early-type galaxies, which is consistent with
current models for the galaxy-halo misalignment predicting $f_\mathrm{h}\simeq

the vicinity of a Kondo impurity. Our analysis extends to the spin-anisotropic
regime, which was not investigated in the literature. We use an original and
numerically exact method, based on a systematic coherent-state expansion of the
ground state of the underlying spin-boson Hamiltonian, which we apply to the
computation of observables that are specific to the fermionic Kondo model. We
also present an important technical improvement to the method, that obviates
the need to discretize modes of the Fermi sea, and allows one to tackle the
problem in the thermodynamic limit. One can thus obtain excellent spatial
resolution over arbitrary length scales, for a relatively low computational
cost, a feature that gives the method an advantage over popular techniques such
as NRG and DMRG. We find that the anisotropic Kondo model shows rich universal
scaling behavior in the spatial structure of the entanglement cloud. First,
SU(2) spin-symmetry is dynamically restored in a finite domain in parameter
space in vicinity of the isotropic line, as expected from poor man's scaling.
We are also able to obtain in closed analytical form a set of different, yet
universal, scaling curves for strong exchange asymmetry, which are parametrized
by the longitudinal exchange coupling. Deep inside the cloud, i.e. for
distances smaller than the Kondo length, the correlation between the electron
spin density and the impurity spin oscillates between ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic values at the scale of the Fermi wavelength, an effect that
is drastically enhanced at strongly anisotropic couplings. Our results also

Szymanski","A New Metric for Quality of Network Community Structure","15 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modularity is widely used to effectively measure the strength of the
community structure found by community detection algorithms. However,
modularity maximization suffers from two opposite yet coexisting problems: in
some cases, it tends to favor small communities over large ones while in
others, large communities over small ones. The latter tendency is known in the
literature as the resolution limit problem. To address them, we propose to
modify modularity by subtracting from it the fraction of edges connecting nodes
of different communities and by including community density into modularity. We
refer to the modified metric as Modularity Density and we demonstrate that it
indeed resolves both problems mentioned above. We describe the motivation for
introducing this metric by using intuitively clear and simple examples. We also
prove that this new metric solves the resolution limit problem. Finally, we
discuss the results of applying this metric, modularity, and several other
popular community quality metrics to two real dynamic networks. The results
imply that Modularity Density is consistent with all the community quality
measurements but not modularity, which suggests that Modularity Density is an
improved measurement of the community quality compared to modularity.

pairing collapses at Tc like the BCS-type superconductors, or it instead
survives above Tc turning into the preformed pair state. A difficulty in this
issue comes from the small magnitude of the nodal gap, which has been
preventing experimentalists from solving it. Here we use a laser ARPES capable
of ultrahigh energy resolution, and detect the point nodes surviving far beyond

the superconductivity occurs when the pair breaking rate is suppressed smaller

hierarchical fractal structure of $\beta$-sheet nano-crystallites, which form a
robust self-similar network exhibiting an non-linear mechanical property. A
combined small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering
(WAXS) study of the nano-crystalline component in dragline silk fibers from
several species of spiders including, Latrodectus hesperus, Nephila clavipes,
Argiope aurantia and Araneus gemmoides is presented. SAXS structure factors
exhibit a `lamellar peak' in the q-range from 0.60 to 0.82 nm$^{-1}$ for
various spider dragline silk fibers, indicating the presence of strong
nano-crystal ordering on the $>$10 nm length-scale. The stochastically
reconstructed electron density maps indicate that the $\beta$-sheet crystals
are hierarchically structured as mass fractals and that nano-crystals tend to
form 10 to 50 nm sized clusters with long-range crystalline ordering. This
nano-crystal ordering along the fiber axis also helps to explain the difference
between axial and radial sound velocities recently measured by Brillouin
spectroscopy.

studies with cubic crystals, the largest enhancement of conductance from
""abrupt"" to ""mixed"" interfaces seems to be correlated with the emergence of
voids in the conserving modes, where $M_c = 0$. Such voids typically arise when
the interlayer coupling is weakly dispersive, making the bands shift rigidly
with momentum. Interfacial mixing also increases alloy scattering, which
reduces conductance in opposition with the mode spectrum expansion. Thus the
conductance across a ""mixed' junction does not always increase relative to that

exhibit irregular behavior quite often. Using 2D time-dependent hydrodynamical
calculations, we show that the mass-outflow is unstable in the cases of thick
accretion flows such as the low angular momentum accretion flow and the
advection-dominated accretion flow. For the low angular momentum flow, the
inward accreting matter on the equatorial plane interacts with the outflowing
gas along the rotational axis and the centrifugally supported oblique shock is
formed at the interface of both the flows, when the viscosity parameter
$\alpha$ is as small as $\alpha \le 10^{-3}$. The hot and rarefied blobs, which
result in the eruptive mass-outflow, are generated in the inner shocked region
and grow up toward the outer boundary. The advection-dominated accretion flow
attains finally in the form of a torus disc with the inner edge of the disc at
$3R_{\rm g} \le r \le 6R_{\rm g}$ and the center at $6R_ {\rm g} \le r \le
10R_{\rm g}$, and a series of hot blobs is intermittently formed near the inner
edge of the torus and grows up along the outer surface of the torus. As a
result, the luminosity and the mass-outflow rate are modulated irregularly
where the luminosity is enhanced by 10-40% and the mass-outflow rate is
increaed by a factor of few up to ten. We interpret the unstable nature of the
outflow to be due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, examining the Richardson
number for the Kelvin-Helmholtz criterion in the inner region of the flow. We
propose that the flare phenomena of Sgr A* may be induced by the unstable
mass-outflow as is found in this work.

a constraint micro channel. Using an open source two phase flow solver (Gerris,
gfs.sourceforge.net) we compute solutions of the bubble dynamics (i.e. shape
and terminal velocity) induced by the interaction between the bubble movement,
the Laplace pressure variation, and the lubrication film near the channel wall.
Quantitative and qualitative results are presented and compared against both
theory and experimental data for small Capillary numbers. We discuss the
technical issues of explicit integration methods on small Capillary numbers
computations, and the possibility of adding Van der Walls forces to give a more
precise picture of the Droplet-based microfluidic problem.

distributed computing. The local nature of an MIS allows for fast solutions in
a static distributed setting, which are logarithmic in the number of nodes or
in their degrees. The result trivially applies for the dynamic distributed
model, in which edges or nodes may be inserted or deleted. In this paper, we
take a different approach which exploits locality to the extreme, and show how
to update an MIS in a dynamic distributed setting, either \emph{synchronous} or
\emph{asynchronous}, with only \emph{a single adjustment} and in a single
round, in expectation. These strong guarantees hold for the \emph{complete
fully dynamic} setting: Insertions and deletions, of edges as well as nodes,
gracefully and abruptly. This strongly separates the static and dynamic
distributed models, as super-constant lower bounds exist for computing an MIS
in the former.
  Our results are obtained by a novel analysis of the surprisingly simple
solution of carefully simulating the greedy \emph{sequential} MIS algorithm
with a random ordering of the nodes. As such, our algorithm has a direct
application as a $3$-approximation algorithm for correlation clustering. This
adds to the important toolbox of distributed graph decompositions, which are
widely used as crucial building blocks in distributed computing.
  Finally, our algorithm enjoys a useful \emph{history-independence} property,
meaning the output is independent of the history of topology changes that
constructed that graph. This means the output cannot be chosen, or even biased,
by the adversary in case its goal is to prevent us from optimizing some
objective function.

is that there is a dichotomy between the color temperatures of ${\rm few}\times

temperatures of ${\rm few}\times 10^5 - 10^6$~K for TDEs discovered with X-ray
satellites. Here we propose that high-temperature TDEs are produced when the
tidal debris of a disrupted star self-intersects relatively close to the
supermassive black hole, in contrast to the more distant self-intersection that
leads to lower color temperatures. In particular, we note from simple ballistic
considerations that greater apsidal precession in an orbit is the key to closer
self-intersection. Thus larger values of $\beta$, the ratio of the tidal radius
to the pericenter distance of the initial orbit, are more likely to lead to
higher temperatures of more compact disks which are super-Eddington and
geometrically and optically thick. For a given star and $\beta$, apsidal
precession also increases for larger black hole masses, but larger black hole
masses imply a lower temperature at the Eddington luminosity. Thus the expected
dependence of the temperature on the mass of the black hole is non-monotonic.
We find that in order to produce a soft X-ray temperature TDE, a deep plunging
stellar orbit with $\beta> 3$ is needed and a black hole mass of $\lesssim
5\times 10^6 M_\odot$ is favored. Although observations of TDEs are
comparatively scarce and are likely dominated by selection effects, it is
encouraging that both expectations are consistent with current data.

find the S-matrix of the states, which turns out to be the same as for the

the search improves considerably the detections compared to a photometric

able to detect UFDGs that are similar to some of the known UFDGs even if the

responsible for shrinking the coexistence region and at sufficiently strong
disorder (approximately equal to twice the bare bandwidth) it drastically
narrows, the critical temperature abruptly goes to zero, and we observe a phase
transition in the absence of a coexistence of the metallic and insulating

of comparable importance for charge localization.

unknown. Following Wang (1995), we argue that radiative cooling in initially
hot thermally-driven outflows can produce fast neutral atomic and photoionized
cool gas. The inevitability of adiabatic cooling from the flow's initial
10^7-10^8K temperature and the shape of the cooling function for T<10^7K imply
that outflows with hot gas mass-loss rate relative to star formation rate of
beta=Mdot_hot/Mdot_star > 0.5 cool radiatively on scales ranging from the size
of the energy injection region to tens of kpc. We highlight the beta and star
formation rate surface density dependence of the column density, emission
measure, radiative efficiency, and velocity. At r_cool, the gas produces X-ray
and then UV/optical line emission with a total power bounded by 10^{-2} L_star
if the flow is powered by steady-state star formation with luminosity L_star.
The wind is thermally unstable at r_cool, potentially leading to a multi-phase
medium. Cooled winds decelerate significantly in the extended gravitational
potential of galaxies. The cool gas precipitated from hot outflows may explain
its prevalence in galactic halos. We forward a picture of winds whereby cool
clouds are initially accelerated by the ram pressure of the hot flow, but are
rapidly shredded by hydrodynamical instabilities, thereby increasing beta,
seeding radiative and thermal instability, and cool gas rebirth. If the cooled
wind shocks as it sweeps up the circumgalactic medium, its cooling time is
short, thus depositing cool gas far out into the halo. Finally, conduction can
dominate energy transport in low-beta hot winds, leading to flatter temperature
profiles than otherwise expected, potentially consistent with X-ray
observations of some starbursts.

and reside exclusively in dark matter haloes; a given dark matter halo may host
galaxies of various luminosities; galaxies inherit the large-scale bias

coplanar debris disc of the same mass, using analytical theory and n-body
simulations. Such an interaction could result from a planet-planet scattering
or merging event. We show that when the planet mass is comparable to that of
the disc, the former is often circularised with little change to its semimajor
axis. The secular effect of such a planet can cause debris to apsidally
anti-align with the planet's orbit (the opposite of what may be naively
expected), leading to the counter-intuitive result that a low-mass planet may
clear a larger region of debris than a higher-mass body would. The interaction
generally results in a double-ringed debris disc, which is comparable to those
observed in HD 107146 and HD 92945. As an example we apply our results to HD
107146, and show that the disc's morphology and surface brightness profile can
be well-reproduced if the disc is interacting with an eccentric planet of
comparable mass (~10-100 Earth masses). This hypothetical planet had a
pre-interaction semimajor axis of 30 or 40 au (similar to its present-day
value) and an eccentricity of 0.4 or 0.5 (which would since have reduced to
~0.1). Thus the planet (if it exists) presently resides near the inner edge of
the disc, rather than between the two debris peaks as may otherwise be
expected. Finally we show that disc self-gravity can be important in this mass
regime and, whilst it would not affect these results significantly, it should
be considered when probing the interaction between a debris disc and a planet.

star forming region GGD 12-15. Over 1000 objects were monitored including about
350 objects within the central 5 arcminutes which is found to be especially
dense in cluster members. The monitoring took place over 38 days and is part of
the Young Stellar Object VARiability (YSOVAR) project. The region was also the
subject of a contemporaneous 67ks $Chandra$ observation. The field includes 119
previously identified pre-main sequence star candidates. X-rays are detected
from 164 objects, 90 of which are identified with cluster members. Overall, we
find that about half the objects in the central 5 arcminutes are young stellar
objects based on a combination of their spectral energy distribution, IR
variability and X-ray emission.
  Most of the stars with IR excess relative to a photosphere show large
amplitude (>0.1 mag) mid-IR variability. There are 39 periodic sources, all but
one of these is found to be a cluster member. Almost half of the periodic
sources do not show IR excesses. Overall, more than 85% of the Class I, flat
spectrum, and Class II sources are found to vary. The amplitude of the
variability is larger in more embedded young stellar objects. Most of the
Class~I/II objects exhibit redder colors in a fainter state, compatible with
time-variable extinction. A few become bluer when fainter, which can be
explained with significant changes in the structure of the inner disk. A search
for changes in the IR due to X-ray events is carried out, but the low number of
flares prevented an analysis of the direct impact of X-ray flares on the IR
lightcurves. However, we find that X-ray detected Class II sources have longer
timescales for change in the mid-IR than a similar set of non-X-ray detected
Class IIs.

expand and dramatically brighten. Our models consist of flux tubes that extend
from the sub-photosphere into the corona. We simulate how flare-accelerated
charged particles propagate down one-dimensional flux tubes and heat the
stellar atmosphere using the Fokker-Planck kinetic theory. Detailed radiative
transfer is included so that model predictions can be directly compared with
observations. The flux of flare-accelerated particles drives return currents
which additionally heat the stellar atmosphere. These effects are also included

of the mass and internal structure of clusters. An important source of
systematic uncertainty in cluster mass and structure measurements is the secure
selection of background galaxies that are gravitationally lensed by clusters.
This issue has been shown to be particular severe for faint blue galaxies. We
therefore explore the selection of faint blue background galaxies, by reference
to photometric redshift catalogs derived from the COSMOS survey and our own
observations of massive galaxy clusters at z~0.2. We show that methods relying
on photometric redshifts of galaxies in/behind clusters based on observations
through five filters, and on deep 30-band COSMOS photometric redshifts are both
inadequate to identify safely faint blue background galaxies. This is due to
the small number of filters used by the former, and absence of massive galaxy
clusters at redshifts of interest in the latter. We therefore develop a
pragmatic method to combine both sets of photometric redshifts to select a
population of blue galaxies based purely on photometric analysis. This sample
yields stacked weak-lensing results consistent with our previously published
results based on red galaxies. We also show that the stacked clustercentric
number density profile of these faint blue galaxies is consistent with
expectations from consideration of the lens magnification signal of the
clusters. Indeed, the observed number density of blue background galaxies
changes by ~10-30 per cent across the radial range over which other surveys
assume it to be flat.

irreversible mechanical responses of soft particle packings to cyclic loading.
The irreversibility observed in molecular dynamics simulations is well
reproduced by the master equation if the system undergoes quasi-static

planning desired contact forces for each end-effector in arbitrary contact

computing the (linearized) optimal momentum feedback law in a receding horizon

then used in a hierarchical whole body control approach. Simulation experiments

clusters of synchronization persist, and computational group theory has

constraints from 16-band HST observations and wide-field multi-color imaging

treatment of cardiac arrest is extremely time sensitive, and use of an
automated external defibrillator (AED) where possible significantly increases
the probability of survival. Placement of AEDs in public locations can improve
survival by enabling bystanders to treat victims of cardiac arrest prior to the
arrival of emergency medical responders. However, since the exact locations of
future cardiac arrests cannot be known a priori, AEDs must be placed
strategically in public locations to ensure their accessibility in the event of
an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest emergency. In this paper, we propose a
data-driven optimization model for deploying AEDs in public spaces while
accounting for uncertainty in future cardiac arrest locations. Our approach
involves discretizing a continuous service area into a large set of scenarios,
where the probability of cardiac arrest at each location is itself uncertain.
We model uncertainty in the spatial risk of cardiac arrest using a polyhedral
uncertainty set that we calibrate using historical cardiac arrest data. We
propose a solution technique based on row-and-column generation that exploits
the structure of the uncertainty set, allowing the algorithm to scale
gracefully with the total number of scenarios. Using real cardiac arrest data
from the City of Toronto, we conduct an extensive numerical study on AED
deployment public locations. We find that hedging against cardiac arrest
location uncertainty can produce AED deployments that outperform a intuitive
sample average approximation by 9 to 15%, and cuts the performance gap with
respect to an ex-post model by half. Our findings suggest that accounting for
cardiac arrest location uncertainty can lead to improved accessibility of AEDs
during cardiac arrest emergencies and the potential for improved survival
outcomes.

these oscillations are actually shock wave propagations along the loop. We also

recently incorporated into distributed processing frameworks to address
challenges in large-scale graph processing. Billion-node graphs that exceed the
memory capacity of standard machines are not well-supported by popular Big Data
tools like MapReduce, which are notoriously poor-performing for iterative graph
algorithms such as PageRank. In response, a new type of framework challenges
one to Think Like A Vertex (TLAV) and implements user-defined programs from the
perspective of a vertex rather than a graph. Such an approach improves
locality, demonstrates linear scalability, and provides a natural way to
express and compute many iterative graph algorithms. These frameworks are
simple to program and widely applicable, but, like an operating system, are
composed of several intricate, interdependent components, of which a thorough
understanding is necessary in order to elicit top performance at scale. To this
end, the first comprehensive survey of TLAV frameworks is presented. In this
survey, the vertex-centric approach to graph processing is overviewed, TLAV
frameworks are deconstructed into four main components and respectively
analyzed, and TLAV implementations are reviewed and categorized.

has received considerable interest in areas such as discrete mathematics,
statistical physics, chemistry and materials science. Yet, the problem of
percolation on dimer-covered lattices has received little attention. In
particular, percolation on lattices that are fully covered by non-overlapping
dimers has not evidently been considered. Here, we propose a novel procedure
for generating random dimer coverings of a given lattice. We then compute the
bond percolation threshold on random and ordered coverings of the square and
the triangular lattice, on the remaining bonds connecting the dimers. We obtain
$p_c=0.367713(2)$ and $p_c=0.235340(1)$ for random coverings of the square and
the triangular lattice, respectively. We observe that the percolation
frustration induced as a result of dimer covering is larger in the
low-coordination-number square lattice. There is also no relationship between
the existence of long-range order in a covering of the square lattice, and its
percolation threshold. In particular, an ordered covering of the square
lattice, denoted by shifted covering in this work, has an unusually low
percolation threshold, and is topologically identical to the triangular
lattice. This is in contrast to the other ordered dimer coverings considered in
this work, which have higher percolation thresholds than the random covering.
In the case of the triangular lattice, the percolation thresholds of the
ordered and random coverings are very close, suggesting the lack of sensitivity
of the percolation threshold to microscopic details of the covering in
highly-coordinated networks.

assumptions: they are either based on optimality arguments involving static

of evolutionary branching points in adaptive dynamics theory. Recent results
indicate that adaptive dynamics may often not converge to equilibrium points
and instead generate complicated trajectories if evolution takes place in
high-dimensional phenotype spaces. Even though some analytical results on
diversification in complex phenotype spaces are available, to study this
problem in general we need to reconstruct individual-based models from the
adaptive dynamics generating the non-equilibrium dynamics. Here we first
provide a method to construct individual-based models such that they faithfully
reproduce the given adaptive dynamics attractor without diversification. We
then show that a propensity to diversify can by introduced by adding Gaussian
competition terms that generate frequency dependence while still preserving the
same adaptive dynamics. For sufficiently strong competition, the disruptive
selection generated by frequency-dependence overcomes the directional evolution
along the selection gradient and leads to diversification in phenotypic
directions that are orthogonal to the selection gradient.

We address this
longstanding question from a computational perspective, focusing on the case of
sound change. Sound change arises from the pronunciation variability ubiquitous
in every speech community, but most such variability does not lead to change.
Hence, an adequate model must allow for stability as well as change. Existing
theories of sound change tend to emphasize factors at the level of individual
learners promoting one outcome or the other, such as channel bias (which favors
change) or inductive bias (which favors stability). Here, we consider how the
interaction of these biases can lead to both stability and change in a
population setting. We find that population structure itself can act as a
source of stability, but that both stability and change are possible only when
both types of bias are active, suggesting that it is possible to understand why
sound change occurs at some times and not others as the population-level result
of the interplay between forces promoting each outcome in individual speakers.
In addition, if it is assumed that learners learn from two or more teachers,
the transition from stability to change is marked by a phase transition,
consistent with the abrupt transitions seen in many empirical cases of sound
change. The predictions of multiple-teacher models thus match empirical cases
of sound change better than the predictions of single-teacher models,
underscoring the importance of modeling language change in a population
setting.

combining the tools of the conformal bootstrap with results obtained through

such models for $N>2$. We provide evidence that the $g_2=0$ models, which have

of them have been well used in clinical applications. In consideration of
biopsy application, a double-plane detector configuration is practical for the
convenience of breast immobilization. However, the serious blurring effect in
the double-plane system with changeable spacing for different breast size
should be studied. Methods: We study a high resolution reconstruction method
applicable for a double-plane PET system with a changeable detector spacing.
Geometric and blurring components should be calculated at real time for
different detector distance. Accurate geometric sensitivity is obtained with a
tube area model. Resolution recovery is achieved by estimating blurring effects
derived from simulated single gamma response information. Results: The results
show that the new geometric modeling gives a more finite and smooth sensitivity
weight in double-plane system. The blurring component yields contrast recovery
levels that could not be reached without blurring modeling, as well as better
visual recovery of the smallest spheres and better delineation of the
structures in the reconstructed images. Statistical noise has lower variance at
the voxel level with blurring modeling than without at matched resolution.
Conclusion: In the distance-changeable double-plane PET, the finite resolution
modeling during reconstruction achieves resolution recovery, without noise
amplification.

zones, tachoclines, play a key role in the process of magnetic field generation
in solar-like stars. We present two sets of global simulations of rotating
turbulent convection and dynamo. The first set considers a stellar convective
envelope only; the second one, aiming at the formation of a tachocline,
considers also the upper part of the radiative zone. Our results indicate that
the resulting mean-flows and dynamo properties like the growth rate, saturation
energy and mode depend on the Rossby (Ro) number. For the first set of models
either oscillatory (with ~2 yr period) or steady dynamo solutions are obtained.
The models in the second set naturally develop a tachocline which, in turn,
leads to the generation of strong mean magnetic field. Since the field is also
deposited into the stable deeper layer, its evolutionary time-scale is much
longer than in the models without a tachocline. Surprisingly, the magnetic
field in the upper turbulent convection zone evolves in the same time scale as
the deep field. These models result in either an oscillatory dynamo with ~30 yr
period or in a steady dynamo depending on Ro. In terms of the mean-field dynamo
coefficients computed using FOSA, the field evolution in the oscillatory models
without a tachocline seems to be consistent with dynamo waves propagating
according to the Parker-Yoshimura sign rule. In the models with tachoclines the
dynamics is more complex involving other transport mechanisms as well as
tachocline instabilities.

selecting a fixed number of slabs and fitting, a procedure which may not

(2) M_star ~ 10^10.5--10^11.1 M_sun, and (3) relatively low specific star

the observed extended Lya emission is likely to be caused by star formation

parametric study, a radiation reaction dominated region has been identified in
which the particle dynamics is greatly effected by this force. In the radiation
reaction dominated region the two significant effects on particle dynamics are
seen viz., (1) saturation in energy gain by the initially resonant particle,
(2) net energy gain by a initially non-resonant particle which is caused due to
resonance broadening. It has been further shown that with the optimum choice of
parameters this scheme can be efficiently used to produce electrons with
energies in the range of hundreds of TeV. The quantum corrections to the

process, with SF observed to be both enhanced in major mergers and suppressed
in minor pair interactions. Such changes likely to arise on short timescales
and be directly related to the galaxy-galaxy interaction time. Here we
investigate the link between dynamical phase and direct measures of SF on
different timescales for pair galaxies, targeting numerous star-formation rate
(SFR) indicators and comparing to pair separation, individual galaxy mass and
pair mass ratio. We split our sample into the higher (primary) and lower
(secondary) mass galaxies in each pair and find that SF is indeed enhanced in
all primary galaxies but suppressed in secondaries of minor mergers. We find
that changes in SF of primaries is consistent in both major and minor mergers,
suggesting that SF in the more massive galaxy is agnostic to pair mass ratio.
We also find that SF is enhanced/suppressed more strongly for short-time
duration SFR indicators (e.g. H-alpha), highlighting recent changes to SF in
these galaxies, which are likely to be induced by the interaction. We propose a
scenario where the lower mass galaxy has its SF suppressed by gas heating or
stripping, while the higher mass galaxy has its SF enhanced, potentially by
tidal gas turbulence and shocks. This is consistent with the seemingly
contradictory observations for both SF suppression and enhancement in close
pairs.

  Light Communication",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Use of multiple light emitting diodes (LED) is an attractive way to increase
spectral efficiency in visible light communications (VLC). A non-DC-biased OFDM
(NDC OFDM) scheme that uses two LEDs has been proposed in the literature
recently. NDC OFDM has been shown to perform better than other OFDM schemes for
VLC like DC-biased OFDM (DCO OFDM) and asymmetrically clipped OFDM (ACO OFDM)
in multiple LEDs settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient multiple LED
OFDM scheme for VLC which uses {\em coded index modulation}. The proposed
scheme uses two transmitter blocks, each having a pair of LEDs. Within each
block, NDC OFDM signaling is done. The selection of which block is activated in
a signaling interval is decided by information bits (i.e., index bits). In
order to improve the reliability of the index bits at the receiver (which is
critical because of high channel correlation in multiple LEDs settings), we
propose to use coding on the index bits alone. We call the proposed scheme as
CI-NDC OFDM (coded index NDC OFDM) scheme. Simulation results show that, for
the same spectral efficiency, CI-NDC OFDM that uses LDPC coding on the index
bits performs better than NDC OFDM.

efficient to have a high-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for each
antenna element. In this paper, a near maximum likelihood (nML) detector for
uplink multiuser massive MIMO systems is proposed where each antenna is
connected to a pair of one-bit ADCs, i.e., one for each real and imaginary
component of the baseband signal. The exhaustive search over all the possible
transmitted vectors required in the original maximum likelihood (ML) detection
problem is relaxed to formulate an ML estimation problem. Then, the ML
estimation problem is converted into a convex optimization problem which can be
efficiently solved. Using the solution, the base station can perform simple
symbol-by-symbol detection for the transmitted signals from multiple users. To
further improve detection performance, we also develop a two-stage nML detector
that exploits the structures of both the original ML and the proposed
(one-stage) nML detectors. Numerical results show that the proposed nML
detectors are efficient enough to simultaneously support multiple uplink users
adopting higher-order constellations, e.g., 16 quadrature amplitude modulation.
Since our detectors exploit the channel state information as part of the
detection, an ML channel estimation technique with one-bit ADCs that shares the
same structure with our proposed nML detector is also developed. The proposed
detectors and channel estimator provide a complete low power solution for the
uplink of a massive MIMO system.

virtual tree-like structure does not require a specific node to act as the root
node that has to stay involved in the computation until termination

the issues of power allocation, decoding order selection, and user grouping
being taken into account. Specifically, with regard to the max-min fairness
criterion, we derive the optimal power allocation in closed-form and prove the
corresponding optimal decoding order for the elementary downlink NOMA system.
By assigning a weighting factor for each user, the analytical results can be
used to evaluate the outage performance of the downlink NOMA system under
various fairness constraints. Further, we investigate the case with user
grouping, in which each user group can be treated as an elementary downlink
NOMA system. The associated problems of power and resource allocation among
different user groups are solved. The implementation complexity issue of NOMA
is also considered with focus on that caused by successive interference
cancellation and user grouping. The complexity and performance tradeoff is
analyzed by simulations, which provides fruitful insights for the practical
application of NOMA. The simulation results substantiate our analysis and show
considerable performance gain of NOMA when compared with orthogonal multiple

algebras.Such varieties have been widely studied as semantic models in
situations where information is incomplete or inconsistent. The most popular
tool for studying bilattices-based algebras is product representation. The
authors recently set up a widely applicable algebraic framework which enabled
product representations over a base variety to be derived in a uniform and
categorical manner. By combining this methodology with that of natural duality
theory, we demonstrate how to build a natural duality for any bilattice-based
variety which has a suitable product representation over a dualisable base
variety. This procedure allows us systematically to present economical natural
dualities for many bilattice-based varieties, for most of which no dual
representation has previously been given. Among our results we highlight that
for bilattices with a generalised conflation operation (not assumed to be an
involution or commute with negation). Here both the associated product
representation and the duality are new. Finally we outline analogous procedures
for pre-bilattice-based algebras (so negation is absent).

supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking to the visible sector, soft masses for the
standard model gauginos are generated at one loop rather than via direct
couplings to the SUSY-breaking field. In any concrete implementation of PGM,
the SUSY-breaking field is therefore required to carry nonzero charge under
some global or local symmetry. As we point out in this note, a prime candidate
for such a symmetry might be B-L, the Abelian gauge symmetry associated with
the difference between baryon number B and lepton number L. The F-term of the
SUSY-breaking field then not only breaks SUSY, but also B-L, which relates the
respective spontaneous breaking of SUSY and B-L at a fundamental level. As a
particularly interesting consequence, we find that the heavy Majorana neutrino
mass scale ends up being tied to the gravitino mass, Lambda_N ~ m_3/2. Assuming
nonthermal leptogenesis to be responsible for the generation of the baryon
asymmetry of the universe, this connection may then explain why SUSY
necessarily needs to be broken at a rather high energy scale, so that m_3/2 >~
1000 TeV in accord with the concept of PGM. We illustrate our idea by means of
a minimal model of dynamical SUSY breaking, in which B-L is identified as a
weakly gauged flavor symmetry. We also discuss the effect of the B-L gauge
dynamics on the superparticle mass spectrum as well as the resulting
constraints on the parameter space of our model. In particular, we comment on
the role of the B-L D-term.

$\tilde{H}_{d-1}(T;\mathbb{F})=0$.
  The $d$-hypertrees are a basic object in combinatorial theory of simplicial

remain poorly understood.
  In this paper we study the boundaries $\partial_d T$ of $d$-hypertrees, and
the fundamental $d$-cycles defined by them. Our findings include:
  1. A full characterization of $\partial_d T$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$ for $d \leq

  2. Lower bounds on the maximum size of a largest simple $d$-cycle on $[n]$.

$[n]$, i.e., a simple $d$-cycle of size ${{n-1} \choose d} + 1$. For $d\geq 3$,
we construct a simple $d$-cycle of size ${{n-1} \choose d} - O(n^{d-2})$.
  3. Observing that the maximum of the expected distance between two vertices

past decades several key questions related with Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) emission
mechanisms are still to be answered. Precise detection of the GRB polarization
carried out by dedicated instruments can provide new data and be an ultimate
tool to unveil their real nature. A novel space-borne Compton polarimeter POLAR
onboard the Chinese space station TG2 is designed to measure linear
polarization of gamma-rays arriving from GRB prompt emissions. POLAR uses
plastics scintillator bars (PS) as gamma-ray detectors and multi-anode
photomultipliers (MAPMTs) for readout of the scintillation light. Inherent
properties of such detection systems are crosstalk and non-uniformity. The
crosstalk smears recorded energy over multiple channels making both
non-uniformity corrections and energy calibration more difficult. Rigorous
extraction of polarization observable requires to take such effects properly
into account. We studied influence of the crosstalk on energy depositions
during laboratory measurements with X-ray beams. A relation between genuine and
recorded energy was deduced using an introduced model of data analysis. It
postulates that both the crosstalk and non-uniformities can be described with a
single matrix obtained in calibrations with mono-energetic X- and gamma-rays.
Necessary corrections are introduced using matrix based equations allowing for
proper evaluation of the measured GRB spectra. Validity of the method was
established during dedicated experimental tests. The same approach can be also
applied in space utilizing POLAR internal calibration sources. The introduced
model is general and with some adjustments well suitable for data analysis from
other MAPMT-based instruments.

the optimal transition temperature occurs at intermediate coupling strength,

superconducting fluctuations are strongest at intermediate doping and
suppressed towards large doping and half-filling. We find a change in sign of
the vertex contributions to $d_{xy}$ superconductivity from repulsive near half
filling to attractive at large doping. $p$-wave superconductivity is not found
at the parameters we study, and $s$-wave contributions are always repulsive.

shifts towards the electron-doped side in opposition to the van Hove

altered cost function but also the distorted values of the technical parameters
of its generating units, which enter the system-wide constraints of the
centralized dispatch optimization problem. To ensure the applicability of the
VCG method in this setting, we identify an additional assumption on the changes
of the feasible set of the centralized dispatch optimization problem induced by
variations of the producer's technical parameters. In the framework of the
generic VCG mechanism, we propose an antimonopoly regulation method based on a
regulator estimate of the producer's truthful bid. If this estimate is exact,
the producer's maximum profit coincides with that in the case of the truthful
bidding when no antimonopoly measure is applied. If the estimate is not exact,
the error affects neither the producer's (weakly) dominant bid nor its optimal
nodal output but manifests itself in the total uplift payment. This ensures an
efficient allocation in the form of the optimal output/consumption schedule and
shields the (pre-uplift) market prices from the producer's market power. We
compare the suggested method with the alternative antimonopoly regulation
approach based on the replacement of the producer's bid by a bid composed by

of a Be-type star and an accreting black hole. Its low X-ray luminosity
indicates that the system is in a quiescent X-ray state.
  Aims. The aim of our investigation is to establish if the MWC 656 system has
detectable radio emission and if the radio characteristics are consistent with
those of quiescent black hole systems.
  Methods. We used three archived VLA data sets, one hour each, at 3 GHz and
seven new VLA observations, two hours each, at 10 GHz to produce very high
sensitivity images, down to $\sim$1$\,\mu$Jy.
  Results. We detected the source twice in the new observations: in the first
VLA run, at periastron passage, with a flux density of 14.2$\,\pm\,$2.9 $\mu$Jy
and by combining all together the other six VLA runs, with a flux density of
$3.7 \pm 1.4$ $\mu$Jy. The resulting combined map of the archived observations
has the sensitivity of $1 \sigma = 6.6\, \mu Jy$ but no radio emission is there
detected.
  Conclusions. The radio and X-ray luminosities agree with the behaviour of
accreting binary black holes in the hard and quiescent state. In particular,
MWC 656 in the $L_X$, $L_R$ plane occupies the same region as A0620$-$00 and
XTE J1118+480, the faintest known black holes up to now.

comparison of stationary distributions of different types of the random surfer
to quantify the similarities and differences between those models as well as
(ii) new insights into the impact of search engines on traditional user

almost similar to those of users - as long as users do not use search engines.
We also find that classical website navigation structures, such as navigation

the mass of individual galaxy clusters is contamination of background galaxy
catalogues by faint cluster and foreground galaxies. We extend our conservative
method for selecting background galaxies with $(V-i')$ colours redder than the
red sequence of cluster members to use a colour-cut that depends on
cluster-centric radius. This allows us to define background galaxy samples that
suffer $\le1$ per cent contamination, and comprise $13$ galaxies per square

systematic that we identify in our analysis is a shape measurement bias of $3$
per cent, that we measure using simulations that probe weak shears upto

excellent agreement with predictions of the mass-concentration relation.
Equally, our stacked shear profile is in excellent agreement with the Navarro
Frenk and White profile. Our new LoCuSS mass measurements are consistent with

parallel charged plates decorated by a fixed array of scatterers representing
the polymer coating. The electro-osmotic flow, generated by a constant electric
field applied in a direction parallel to the plates, is studied numerically by
means of Lattice Boltzmann simulations. In order to gain further understanding
we performed a simple theoretical analysis by extending the Stokes-Smoluchowski
equation to take into account the porosity induced by the polymers in the
region adjacent the walls. We discuss the nature of the velocity profiles by
focusing on the competing effects of the polymer charges and the frictional
forces they exert. We show evidence of the flow reduction and of the flow
inversion phenomenon when the polymer charge is opposite to the surface charge.
By using the density of polymers and the surface charge as control variables,
we propose a phase diagram that discriminates the direct and the reversed flow
regimes and determine its dependence on the ionic concentration.

that they can be used jointly to improve the system performance. We consider a
transmitter-receiver pair, showing how the ET improvement depends upon the
statistics of the energy arrivals and the energy consumption of the devices.
With the aim of maximizing a reward function, e.g., the average transmission
rate, we find performance upper bounds with and without ET, define both online

energy arrivals in indoor and outdoor environments. We show that ET can
significantly improve the system performance even when a sizable fraction of
the transmitted energy is wasted and that, in some scenarios, the online
approach can obtain close to optimal performance.

predicting First Daily Departure Times (FDDTs) of everyday use electric

disconnection times of such mobile storage units, for instance to forecast
storage of non dispatchable loads (e.g. wind and solar power). We provide a
review of the relevant state-of-the-art driving behavior features towards FDDT
prediction, to then propose an approximated Gaussian method which qualitatively
forecasts how many vehicles will depart within a given time frame, by assuming
that departure times follow a normal distribution. This method considers
sampling sessions as Poisson distributions which are superimposed to obtain a
single approximated Gaussian model. Given the Gaussian distribution assumption
of the departure times, we also model the problem with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM), in which the priorly set number of clusters represents the desired time
granularity. Evaluation has proven that for the dataset tested, low error and
high confidence ($\approx 95\%$) is possible for 15 and 10 minute intervals,
and that GMM outperforms traditional modeling but is less generalizable across
datasets, as it is a closer fit to the sampling data. Conclusively we discuss

flows, using as a model the two-dimensional channel flow of a thin falling film
sheared by counter-current gas. The methodology is linear stability theory
(Orr-Sommerfeld analysis) together with direct numerical simulation of the
two-phase flow in the case of nonlinear disturbances. We investigate the
influence of three main flow parameters (density contrast between liquid and
gas, film thickness, pressure drop applied to drive the gas stream) on the
interfacial dynamics. Energy budget analyses based on the Orr-Sommerfeld theory
reveal various coexisting unstable modes (interfacial, shear, internal) in the
case of high density contrasts, which results in mode coalescence and mode
competition, but only one dynamically relevant unstable internal mode for low
density contrast. The same linear stability approach provides a quantitative
prediction for the onset of (partial) liquid flow reversal in terms of the gas
and liquid flow rates. A study of absolute and convective instability for low
density contrast shows that the system is absolutely unstable for all but two
narrow regions of the investigated parameter space. Direct numerical
simulations of the same system (low density contrast) show that linear theory
holds up remarkably well upon the onset of large-amplitude waves as well as the
existence of weakly nonlinear waves. In comparison, for high density contrasts
corresponding more closely to an air-water-type system, although the linear
stability theory is successful at determining the most-dominant features in the
interfacial wave dynamics at early-to-intermediate times, the short waves
selected by the linear theory undergo secondary instability and the wave train
is no longer regular but rather exhibits chaotic dynamics and eventually, wave
overturning.

In industrial networks, nodes are firms and links are directed
supplier-customer relationships. While both in- and out-degree distributions
have ""power law"" regimes, out-degree distribution decays faster than in-degree
distribution and crosses it at a consistent nodal degree. It implies that, as
link degree increases, the constraints to the capacity for designing, producing
and transmitting artifacts out to others grow faster than and surpasses those
for acquiring, absorbing and synthesizing artifacts provided from others. We
further discover that this asymmetry in decaying rates of in-degree and
out-degree distributions is smaller in networks that process and transmit more
decomposable artifacts, e.g. informational artifacts in contrast with physical
artifacts. This asymmetry in in-degree and out-degree distributions is likely
to hold for other directed networks, but to different degrees, depending on the
decomposability of the processed and transmitted artifacts.

namely an exact equations of motion (EOMs) method and a Chebyshev expansion
technique (CET). By assuming a wheel topology of the bath spins with uniform
nearest-neighbor $XX$-type intrabath coupling, we examine the central spin
dynamics with the bath prepared in two different types of bath initial
conditions. For fully polarized baths in strong magnetic fields, the
polarization dynamics of the central spin exhibits a collapse-revival behavior
in the intermediate-time regime. Under an antiferromagnetic bath initial
condition, the two methods give excellently consistent central spin decoherence
dynamics for finite-size baths of $N\leq14$ bath spins. The decoherence factor
is found to drop off abruptly on a short time scale and approach a finite
plateau value which depends on the intrabath coupling strength
non-monotonically. In the ultrastrong intrabath coupling regime, the plateau
values show an oscillatory behavior depending on whether $N/2$ is even or odd.
The observed results are interpreted qualitatively within the framework of the
EOM and perturbation analysis. The effects of anisotropic spin-bath coupling
and inhomogeneous intrabath bath couplings are briefly discussed. Possible

suggested.

values of several distributions given a finite budget of samples. If the
variance of the distributions were known, one could design an optimal sampling
strategy by collecting a number of independent samples per distribution that is
proportional to their variance. However, in the more realistic case where the
distributions are not known in advance, one needs to design adaptive sampling
strategies in order to select which distribution to sample from according to
the previously observed samples. We describe two strategies based on pulling
the distributions a number of times that is proportional to a high-probability
upper-confidence-bound on their variance (built from previous observed samples)
and report a finite-sample performance analysis on the excess estimation error
compared to the optimal allocation. We show that the performance of these
allocation strategies depends not only on the variances but also on the full
shape of the distributions.

There is also an indication of the presence of a 6.4 keV iron line in the

pulsation period reveal that the pulsar has undergone a strong and steady

is constant with energy up to 40 keV. The power density spectrum shows a break
towards higher frequencies relative to the current spin period. This, together

by numerical simulations, with uncertain and limited data of direct
observations. For the input parameters, we suggest their minimal set, which
complies with commonly available data. For output seismic parameters, we
distinguish three major groups, which are provided by field observations. The
first group includes the common (minimal) data on distributions of the event
location. These distributions are of special value for improving the input data
on geometrical features of a problem. The second group employs the data

seismic moment/potency, provided by advanced mining seismic systems. This group
includes distributions of the geometrical parameters of the event source

correlations between topological and geometrical properties of a
two-dimensional shuffled foam has been proposed and compared with experimental
and numerical data. Here, the various assumptions on which the model is based
are exposed and justified: the equiprobability hypothesis of the foam
configurations is argued. The range of correlations between bubbles is
discussed, and the mean field approximation that is used in the model is
detailed. The two self-consistency equations associated with this mean field
description can be interpreted as the conservation laws of number of sides and
bubble curvature, respectively. Finally, the use of a '' Grand-Canonical ''
description, in which the foam constitutes a reservoir of sides and curvature,
is justified.

considerable interest in complex problems where exact likelihoods are hard to
obtain. In their most basic form, Bayesian methods such as Approximate Bayesian
Computation (ABC) involve sampling from the parameter space and keeping those
parameters that produce data that fit sufficiently well to the actually
observed data. Exploring the whole parameter space, however, makes this
approach inefficient in high dimensional problems. This led to the proposal of
more sophisticated iterative methods of inference such as particle filters.
  Here, we propose an alternative approach that is based on stochastic gradient
methods and applicable both in a frequentist and a Bayesian setting. By moving
along a simulated gradient, the algorithm produces a sequence of estimates that
will eventually converge either to the maximum likelihood estimate or to the
maximum of the posterior distribution, in each case under a set of observed
summary statistics. To avoid reaching only a local maximum, we propose to run
the algorithm from a set of random starting values.
  As good tuning of the algorithm is important, we explored several tuning
strategies, and propose a set of guidelines that worked best in our
simulations. We investigate the performance of our approach in simulation
studies, and also apply the algorithm to two models with intractable likelihood
functions. First, we present an application to inference in the context of
queuing systems. We also re-analyze population genetic data and estimate
parameters describing the demographic history of Sumatran and Bornean
orang-utan populations.

that the epidemic threshold, a fundamental quantity underlying the spreading

some critical value of the assortativity coefficient, a parameter
characterizing the network correlation. To understand this phenomenon, we use
the degree-based mean-field theory to calculate the traffic-driven epidemic
threshold for correlated networks. The theory predicts that the threshold is
inversely proportional to the packet-generation rate and the largest eigenvalue
of the betweenness matrix. We obtain consistency between theory and numerics.

optical conductivity is strongly influenced by the formation of the coherent
Kondo liquid: a sharp Drude peak develops and a hybridization gap at 12 meV
leads to a spectral weight transfer to mid-infrared energies. The c axis
conductivity has a different behavior: the Drude peak already exists at 300 K
and no particular anomaly or gap signature appears in the coherent Kondo liquid
regime. When entering the hidden-order state, both polarizations see a dramatic
decrease in the Drude spectral weight and scattering rate, compatible with a
loss of about 50 % of the carriers at the Fermi level. At the same time a
density-wave like gap appears along both polarizations at about 6.5 meV at 5 K.
This gap closes respecting a mean field thermal evolution in the ab plane.

simulation of single-dish observations including an instrumental noise model
with 1/f and white noise, and sky emission with a diffuse Galactic foreground
and HI emission. We consider two foreground cleaning methods: spectral
parametric fitting and principal component analysis. For a smooth frequency
spectrum of the foreground and instrumental effects, we find that the
parametric fitting method provides residuals that are still contaminated by
foreground and 1/f noise, but the principal component analysis can remove this
contamination down to the thermal noise level. This method is robust for a
range of different models of foreground and noise, and so constitutes a
promising way to recover the HI signal from the data. However, it induces a
leakage of the cosmological signal into the subtracted foreground of around 5%.
The efficiency of the component separation methods depends heavily on the
smoothness of the frequency spectrum of the foreground and the 1/f noise. We
find that as, long as the spectral variations over the band are slow compared
to the channel width, the foreground cleaning method still works.

amongst many with the largest mean when these means are unknown but population
samples can be simulated or otherwise generated. Typically, by selecting
largest sample mean population, it can be shown that false selection
probability decays at an exponential rate. Lately, researchers have sought
algorithms that guarantee that this probability is restricted to a small
$\delta$ in order $\log(1/\delta)$ computational time by estimating the
associated large deviations rate function via simulation. We show that such
guarantees are misleading when populations have unbounded support even when
these may be light-tailed. Specifically, we show that any policy that
identifies the correct population with probability at least $1-\delta$ for each
problem instance requires infinite number of samples in expectation in making
such a determination in any problem instance. This suggests that some
restrictions are essential on populations to devise $O(\log(1/\delta))$
algorithms with $1 - \delta$ correctness guarantees. We note that under
restriction on population moments, such methods are easily designed, and that
sequential methods from stochastic multi-armed bandit literature can be adapted
to devise such algorithms.

For the Klein-Gordon field, namely when $V(\phi)=m^{2}|\phi|^{2}$, it is proved
that geodesically complete solutions have Ricci-flat spatial metric, have
constant lapse and are vacuum, (that is $\phi$ is constant and equal to zero if
$m\neq 0$). In particular, when the spatial dimension is three, the only such
solutions are either Minkowski or a quotient thereof (no nontrivial solutions
exist). When $V(\phi)=m^{2}|\phi|^{2}+2\Lambda$, that is, when a vacuum energy

complete solution exists when $\Lambda>0$, whereas when $\Lambda<0$ it is
proved that no non-vacuum geodesically complete solution exists unless
$m^{2}<-2\Lambda/(n-1)$, ($n$ is the spatial dimension) and the spatial

evolution. Fortunately, the stellar internal rotation can be probed through
studies of rotationally-split non-radial oscillation modes. In particular,
detection of non-radial gravity modes (g modes) in massive young stars has
become feasible recently thanks to the Kepler space mission. Our aim is to
derive the internal rotation profile of the Kepler B8V star KIC 10526294
through asteroseismology. We interpret the observed rotational splittings of
its dipole g modes using four different approaches based on the best seismic
models of the star and their rotational kernels. We show that these kernels can
resolve differential rotation the radiative envelope if a smooth rotational
profile is assumed and the observational errors are small. Based on Kepler
data, we find that the rotation rate near the core-envelope boundary is well
constrained to $163\pm89$ nHz. The seismic data are consistent with rigid
rotation but a profile with counter-rotation within the envelope has a
statistical advantage over constant rotation. Our study should be repeated for
other massive stars with a variety of stellar parameters in order to deduce the
physical conditions that determine the internal rotation profile of young
massive stars, with the aim to improve the input physics of their models.

correspondences of multiple faces in low temporal resolution egocentric videos

additional challenges to the multi-tracking problem with respect to
conventional videos. Due to the free motion of the camera and to its low
temporal resolution, abrupt changes in the field of view, in illumination
condition and in the target location are highly frequent. To overcome such
difficulties, we propose a multi-face tracking method that generates a set of

detected face and takes advantage of the tracklets redundancy to deal with
unreliable ones. Similar tracklets are grouped into the so called extended
bag-of-tracklets (eBoT), which is aimed to correspond to a specific person.
Finally, a prototype tracklet is extracted for each eBoT, where the occurred
occlusions are estimated by relying on a new measure of confidence. We

the distribution of chemotactic bacteria around multiple nearby food sources.
In contrast to the optimization of uptake rate that may hold at the level of a
single cell in a spatially varying nutrient field, nutrient consumption by a
population of chemotactic cells will modify the nutrient field, and the uptake
rate will generally vary throughout the population. Through a simple model we
study the distribution of resource uptake in the presence of chemotaxis,
consumption, and diffusion of both bacteria and nutrients. Borrowing from the
field of theoretical economics, we explore how the Gini index can be used as a
means to quantify the inequalities of uptake. The redistributive effect of
chemotaxis can lead to a phenomenon we term `chemotactic levelling', and the
influence of these results on population fitness are briefly considered.

LK$_d$ is a generalized variant of the RSA model for both $k$-mers and a

precoding, which uses a small number of RF chains to avoid energy consumption
associated with mixed signal components like analog-to-digital components not
to mention baseband processing complexity. However, most hybrid precoding
techniques consider a fully-connected architecture requiring a large number of
phase shifters, which is also energyintensive. In this paper, we focus on the
more energy-efficient hybrid precoding with sub-connected architecture, and
propose a successive interference cancelation (SIC)-based hybrid precoding with
near-optimal performance and low complexity. Inspired by the idea of SIC for
multi-user signal detection, we first propose to decompose the total achievable
rate optimization problem with non-convex constraints into a series of simple
sub-rate optimization problems, each of which only considers one sub-antenna
array. Then, we prove that maximizing the achievable sub-rate of each
sub-antenna array is equivalent to simply seeking a precoding vector
sufficiently close (in terms of Euclidean distance) to the unconstrained
optimal solution. Finally, we propose a low-complexity algorithm to realize
SICbased hybrid precoding, which can avoid the need for the singular value
decomposition (SVD) and matrix inversion. Complexity evaluation shows that the
complexity of SIC-based hybrid precoding is only about 10% as complex as that
of the recently proposed spatially sparse precoding in typical mmWave MIMO
systems. Simulation results verify the near-optimal performance of SIC-based
hybrid precoding.

velocity mismatch between laser pulses moving at the speed of light and slowly
moving massive ions. Instead of directly accelerating the ions, current
approaches rely on TV/m laser fields to ionize and drive out electrons. The
ions are then accelerated by the resulting electrostatic fields from charge
separation. Here we report experimental and numerical acceleration of ions by
means of laser driven Z-pinch exiting a sharp plasma interface. This is
achieved by first driving a plasma wakefield in the self-modulated bubble
regime. Cold return currents are generated to maintain quasi-neutrality of the
plasma. The opposite current repel and form an axial fast current and a
cylindrical-shell cold return current with a large (100 MG) azithmuthal field
in between. These conditions produce a Z-pinch that compresses the fast
electrons and ions on axis. If this process is terminated at a sharp plasma
interface, a beam of ions are then accelerated in the forward direction as the
Z-pinch collapses. These results provide a new route towards laser-accelerated
ions as well as potential laboratory scale modeling of z-pinches in
astrophysical events.

beamforming (including transmit precoding and receive combining) is usually
used to compensate the severe attenuation of mmWave signals. However,
conventional beamforming schemes involve complicated search among pre-defined
codebooks to find out the optimal pair of analog precoder and analog combiner.
To solve this problem, by exploring the idea of turbo equalizer together with
tabu search (TS) algorithm, we propose a Turbo-like beamforming scheme based on
TS, which is called Turbo-TS beamforming in this paper, to achieve the
near-optimal performance with low complexity. Specifically, the proposed
Turbo-TS beamforming scheme is composed of the following two key components: 1)
Based on the iterative information exchange between the base station and the
user, we design a Turbo-like joint search scheme to find out the near-optimal
pair of analog precoder and analog combiner; 2) Inspired by the idea of TS
algorithm developed in artificial intelligence, we propose a TS-based
precoding/combining scheme to intelligently search the best precoder/combiner
in each iteration of Turbo-like joint search with low complexity. Analysis
shows that the proposed Turbo-TS beamforming can considerably reduce the

densities, H2 can be in a phase transition leading to the formation of ice
clumps as large as comets or even planets. However, He has very different
chemical properties and no phase transition is expected before H2 in dense
interstellar medium (ISM) conditions. The gravitational stability of fluid
mixtures has been studied before, but these studies did not include a phase
transition.
  First, we study the gravitational stability of van der Waals fluid mixtures
using linearized analysis and examine virial equilibrium conditions using the
Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential. Then, combining the Lennard-Jones and
gravitational potentials, the non-linear dynamics of fluid mixtures are studied
via computer simulations using the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS.
  Along with the classical, ideal-gas Jeans instability criterion, a fluid
mixture is always gravitationally unstable if it is in a phase transition
because compression does not increase pressure. However, the condensed phase
fraction increases. In unstable situations the species can separate: in some
conditions He precipitates faster than H2, while in other conditions the
converse occurs. Also, for an initial gas phase collapse the geometry is
essential. Contrary to spherical or filamentary collapses, sheet-like collapses
starting below 15K easily reach H2 condensation conditions because then they
are fastest and both the increase of heating and opacity are limited.
  Depending on density, temperature and mass, either rocky H2 planetoids, or
gaseous He planetoids form. H2 planetoids are favoured by high density, low
temperature and low mass, while He planetoids need more mass and can form at
temperature well above the critical value.

overlapping modularity density, and six other community quality metrics show

distribution of the particles' positions. Second, we use this evolution

density correlation function the non-equilibrium character of the active system
manifests itself through the presence of a new steady-state correlation
function that quantifies spatial correlations of the velocities of the
particles. This correlation function enters into the frequency term, and thus
it describes the dependence of the short-time dynamics on the properties of the
self-propulsions. More importantly, the correlation function of particles'
velocities enters into the vertex of the memory function and through the vertex
it modifies the long-time glassy dynamics.

Specifically, the temporal correlation of time-varying channels is exploited to
generate the differential channel impulse response (CIR) between two CIRs in
neighboring time slots, which enjoys a much stronger sparsity than the original
sparse CIRs. Thus, the base station can recover the differential CIR from the

Jeltema and Profumo on the grounds that model spectra suggest that atomic
transitions in helium-like potassium (K XVIII) and chlorine (Cl XVI) are more
likely to be the emitters. Here it is pointed out that the K XVIII lines have
been observed in numerous solar flare spectra at high spectral resolution with
the RESIK crystal spectrometer and also appear in Chandra HETG spectra of the
coronally active star sigma Gem. In addition, the solar flare spectra at least
indicate a mean coronal potassium abundance which is a factor of between 9 and

low statistical quality of the XMM-Newton spectra, completely accounts for the

very effective in estimating the non-linear matter power spectrum ($P(k)$). We
employ the prediction ability of the supervised ML algorithms to build an
estimator for the $P(k)$. The estimator is trained on a set of cosmological
models, and redshifts for which the $P(k)$ is known, and it learns to predict
$P(k)$ for any other set. We review three ML algorithms -- Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbours -- and investigate their
prime parameters to optimize the prediction accuracy of the estimator. We also
compute an optimal size of the training set, which is realistic enough, and
still yields high accuracy. We find that, employing the optimal values of the
internal parameters, a set of $50-100$ cosmological models is enough to train
the estimator that can predict the $P(k)$ for a wide range of cosmological
models, and redshifts. Using this configuration, we build a blackbox --
Supervised Estimator for Matter Power Spectrum (SEMPS) -- that computes the
$P(k)$ to 5-10$\%$ accuracy up to $k\sim 10 h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ with respect to
the reference model (cosmic emulator). We also compare the estimations of SEMPS
to that of the Halofit, and find that for the $k$-range where the cosmic
variance is low, SEMPS estimates are better than that of the Halofit. The
predictions of the SEMPS are instantaneous in the sense that it can evaluate up
to 500 $P(k)$ in less than one second, which makes it ideal for many
applications like visualisations, weak lensing, emulations, likelihood analysis
etc.. As a supplement to this article, we provide a publicly available software

Schr\""odinger equation with spatially concentrated nonlinearity in space
dimension three. The nonlinearity studied is a power nonlinearity concentrated
at the point $x=0$ obtained considering a contact (or $\delta$) interaction
with strength $\alpha$, and letting the strength $\alpha$ depend on the
wavefunction in a prescribed way. For power nonlinearities in the range
$(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2},1)$ there exist orbitally stable standing waves
$\Phi_\omega$, and the linearization around them admits two imaginary
eigenvalues which in principle could correspond to non decaying states, so
preventing asymptotic relaxation towards an equilibrium orbit. Without using
the Fermi Golden Rule we prove that, in the range $(\frac{1}{\sqrt
2},\sigma^*)$ for a certain $\sigma^* \in (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{\sqrt{3}
+1}{2 \sqrt{2}}]$, the dynamics near the orbit of a standing wave
asymptotically relaxes towards a standing state. Contrarily to the main results
in the field, the admitted nonlinearity is $L^2$-subcritical.

increase in spectral and energy efficiency, and it usually exploits the hybrid
analog and digital precoding to overcome the serious signal attenuation induced
by mmWave frequencies. However, most of hybrid precoding schemes focus on the
full-array structure, which involves a high complexity. In this paper, we
propose a near-optimal iterative hybrid precoding scheme based on the more
realistic subarray structure with low complexity. We first decompose the
complicated capacity optimization problem into a series of ones easier to be
handled by considering each antenna array one by one. Then we optimize the
achievable capacity of each antenna array from the first one to the last one by
utilizing the idea of successive interference cancelation (SIC), which is
realized in an iterative procedure that is easy to be parallelized. It is shown
that the proposed hybrid precoding scheme can achieve better performance than
other recently proposed hybrid precoding schemes, while it also enjoys an
acceptable computational complexity.
