complex networks. A well established example of such a model is the erased
configuration model, where each node receives a number of half-edges that are
connected to half-edges of other nodes at random, and then self-loops are
removed and multiple edges are concatenated to make the graph simple. Although
asymptotic results for many properties of this model, such as the limiting
degree distribution, are known, the exact speed of convergence in terms of the
graph sizes remains an open question. We provide a first answer by analyzing
the size dependence of the average number of removed edges in the erased
configuration model. By combining known upper bounds with a Tauberian Theorem
we obtain upper bounds for the number of removed edges, in terms of the size of
the graph. Remarkably, when the degree distribution follows a power-law, we
observe three scaling regimes, depending on the power law exponent. Our results
provide a strong theoretical basis for evaluating finite-size effects in
networks.

often the result of highly coordinated responses of large numbers of neurons

oscillations which are captured by electroencephalograms (EEG). In this paper,
we examine EEGs as this is the primary data being used by our collaborators who
are studying coordination of neuronal response during the execution of tasks
such as learning, and memory formation, retention and retrieval. In this paper,
we develop the spectral merger clustering (SMC) method that identifies
synchronized brain regions during resting state in a sense that these regions
share similar oscillations or waveforms. The SMC method, produces clusters of
EEGs which serve as a proxy for segmenting the brain cortical surface since the
EEGs capture neuronal activity over a locally distributed region on the
cortical surface. The extent of desynchronicity between a pair of EEGs is
measured using the total variation distance (TVD) which gives the largest
possible difference between the spectral densities of the pair of EEGs. We
considered the spectral merger algorithm for clustering EEGs, which updates the
spectral estimate of the cluster from a weighted average of the spectral
estimate obtained from each EEG in the cluster. Numerical experiments suggest
that the SMC method performs very well in producing the correct clusters. When
applied to resting state EEG data, the method showed how some regions, though
not contiguously connected on the cortical surface, are spectrally synchronized
during resting state. Moreover, the method demonstrates that brain
organization, as expressed in cluster formation, evolves over resting state.

begin with the unitarity sum-rules of the weak gauge boson scattering assuming
the Higgs sector is extended. According to the sum-rules, we discuss the Higgs
interpretations of the diboson signals and the consistency with the ATLAS
diboson anomaly and other experimental constraints. As a concrete example, we
propose a two-Higgs-doublet model where the Yukawa coupling of an extra CP-even
scalar with up-type quark is relatively large. The diboson (WW and ZZ) signals
can be explained by 2 TeV CP-even Higgs boson, while the partners, the CP-odd
and the charged Higgs bosons in the extra doublet, are severely constrained by
both the LHC direct search and the indirect search via flavor observables.
Especially, in order to avoid the diboson resonance search in the Vh channel,
further extensions of the model are required. The diboson excess is correlated
with the SM Higgs signals in our framework, so that the precise measurement of
the SM Higgs boson is also important to test the Higgs interpretation.

currents are neutralized in active regions (ARs). This question was recently
revisited using three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical
simulations of magnetic flux emergence into the solar atmosphere. Such
simulations showed that flux emergence can generate a substantial net current
in ARs. Another source of AR currents are photospheric horizontal flows. Our
aim is to determine the conditions for the occurrence of net vs. neutralized
currents with this second mechanism. Using 3D MHD simulations, we
systematically impose line-tied, quasi-static, photospheric twisting and
shearing motions to a bipolar potential magnetic field. We find that such
flows: (1) produce both {\it direct} and {\it return} currents, (2) induce very
weak compression currents - not observed in 2.5D - in the ambient field present
in the close vicinity of the current-carrying field, and (3) can generate
force-free magnetic fields with a net current. We demonstrate that neutralized
currents are in general produced only in the absence of magnetic shear at the
photospheric polarity inversion line - a special condition rarely observed. We
conclude that, as magnetic flux emergence, photospheric flows can build up net
currents in the solar atmosphere, in agreement with recent observations. These
results thus provide support for eruption models based on pre-eruption magnetic
fields possessing a net coronal current.

CH the bow shock heat transfer efficiency, and vo the solar escape speed (619

Poisson equation on rectangular domains by using the compact finite difference
(FD) method with unequal meshsizes in different coordinate directions. The
resulting linear system from compact FD discretization is solved by the
conjugate gradient (CG) method with a relative residual stopping criterion. By
combining the Richardson extrapolation and tri-quartic Lagrange interpolation
for the numerical solutions from two-level of grids (current and previous
grids), we are able to produce an extremely accurate approximation of the
actual numerical solution on the next finer grid, which can greatly reduce the
number of relaxation sweeps needed. Additionally, a simple method based on the
midpoint extrapolation formula is used for the fourth-order FD solutions on
two-level of grids to achieve sixth-order accuracy on the entire fine grid
cheaply and directly. The gradient of the numerical solution can also be easily
obtained through solving a series of tridiagonal linear systems resulting from
the fourth-order compact FD discretizations. Numerical results show that our
EXCMG method is much more efficient than the classical V-cycle and W-cycle
multigrid methods. Moreover, only few CG iterations are required on the finest
grid to achieve full fourth-order accuracy in both the $L^2$-norm and
$L^{\infty}$-norm for the solution and its gradient when the exact solution
belongs to $C^6$. Finally, numerical result shows that our EXCMG method is
still effective when the exact solution has a lower regularity, which widens

loops and walks characterized by a spatial Markov property such that,
conditionally on the value of the edge-occupation field on a boundary set, the
distributions of the loops and arcs on either side of the boundary are
independent of each other. The field has a Gibbs distribution with a
Hamiltonian given by a sum of terms which involve only edges incident on the
same vertex. Its free energy density and other quantities can be computed
exactly, and their critical behavior analyzed, in any dimension.

to the analysis of data streams and to the one-pass analysis of massive data
sets. Applications include network traffic and latency analysis, real time
fraud detection and high frequency trading. We introduce new techniques for
online quantile estimation based on Hermite series estimators in the settings
of static quantile estimation and dynamic quantile estimation. In the static
quantile estimation setting we apply the existing Gauss-Hermite expansion in a
novel manner. In particular, we exploit the fact that Gauss-Hermite

estimation we introduce a novel expansion with an exponentially weighted
estimator for the Gauss-Hermite coefficients which we term the Exponentially
Weighted Gauss-Hermite (EWGH) expansion. These algorithms go beyond existing
sequential quantile estimation algorithms in that they allow arbitrary
quantiles (as opposed to pre-specified quantiles) to be estimated at any point

online quantile function estimation on data streams. In particular we derive an
analytical expression for the CDF and prove consistency results for the CDF

formation history from integrated light spectroscopy. To this end, several
classes of chemically peculiar (CP) stars arise during the course of normal
evolution in single stars and noninteracting binary stars. An aging stellar
population has periods of time in which CP stars contribute to the integrated
light, and others in which the contributions fade. The HgMn stars, for example,
occupy a narrow temperature range of 10500 to 16000 K, which maps to a narrow
range of ages. Wolf-Rayet stars, He-poor stars, Bp-Ap stars, Am-Fm stars, and C
stars all become very common in a normal stellar population at various ages
between zero and several Gyr, fading in and out in a way that is analogous to
features used in stellar spectral classification. We examine population
fractions and light fractions in order to assess the feasibility of using CP
stars as age tracers. We find that, even though CP stars do not usually
dominate in number, there are enough of them so that the CP spectral features
are detectable in high-quality integrated spectra of young and intermediate age
stellar populations. The new technique should be calibratable and useful.
Furthermore, using CP signatures as age dating tools sidesteps reliance on
photometry that is susceptible to dust and Balmer features that are susceptible
to nebular fill-in.

linear response method were reformulated within the constraint volume of
thegiven solids. The band structures were also calculated. This method yields
nearly constant optical transition gaps between Ln-5d and O-2p orbitals, with
magnitudes of 5.3~5.5 eV. This result verifies that the error in the band
structure calculations for Ln2O3 is dominated by the inaccuracies in the
predicted 4f levels in the 2p-5d transition gaps, which strongly and
nonlinearly depend on the on-site Hubbard U. The relationship between the 4f
occupancies and Hubbard U is non-monotonic and is entirely different from that
for materials with 3d or 4d orbitals, such as transition metal oxides. This new
linear response DFT+U method can provide a simpler understanding of the

signal is highly significant (10 to 15$\sigma$ for the smallest angular scales)
for troughs with the redshift range z in [0.2,0.5] of the projected galaxy

the connection between the galaxy, matter density, and convergence fields. By
assuming galaxies are biased tracers of the matter density with Poissonian
noise, we find agreement of our measurements with predictions in a fiducial
Lambda cold dark matter model. The prediction for the lensing signal on large
trough scales is virtually independent of the details of the underlying model
for the connection of galaxies and matter. Our comparison of the shear around
troughs with that around cylinders with large galaxy counts is consistent with
a symmetry between galaxy and matter over- and underdensities. In addition, we
measure the two-point angular correlation of troughs with galaxies which, in
contrast to the lensing signal, is sensitive to galaxy bias on all scales. The
lensing signal of troughs and their clustering with galaxies is therefore a
promising probe of the statistical properties of matter underdensities and

survey will map the sky with a specific emission line, interloping emission
lines can masquerade as the survey's intended emission line at different
redshifts. Interloping lines from galaxies that are not removed can contaminate
the power spectrum measurement, mixing correlations from various redshifts and
diluting the true signal. We assess the potential for power spectrum
contamination, finding that an interloper fraction worse than 0.2% could bias
power spectrum measurements for future surveys by more than 10% of statistical
errors, while also biasing power spectrum inferences. We also construct a
formalism for predicting cosmological parameter bias, demonstrating that a
0.15%-0.3% interloper fraction could bias the growth rate by more than 10% of
the error, which can affect constraints on gravity upcoming surveys. We use the
COSMOS Mock Catalog (CMC), with the emission lines re-scaled to better
reproduce recent data, to predict potential interloper fractions for the Prime
Focus Spectrograph (PFS) and the Wide-Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST).
We find that secondary line identification, or confirming galaxy redshifts by
finding correlated emission lines, can remove interlopers for PFS. For WFIRST,
we use the CMC to predict that the 0.2% target can be reached for the WFIRST
H$\alpha$ survey, but sensitive optical and near-infrared photometry will be
required. For the WFIRST [OIII] survey, the predicted interloper fractions
reach several percent and their effects will have to be estimated and removed

quadrant, using a combination of fast mapping techniques with the Mopra radio
telescope, simultaneously in the J=1-0 lines of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO,
C$^{18}$O, and CN near 112 GHz at ~arcminute and ~0.3 km s$^{-1}$ resolution,
with ~2 K channel$^{-1}$ sensitivity for $^{12}$CO and ~1 K channel$^{-1}$ for
the other transitions. The calibrated data cubes from these observations are
made available to the community after processing through our pipeline. Here, we
describe the motivation for ThrUMMS, the development of new observing
techniques for Mopra, and how these techniques were optimised to the objectives
of the survey. We showcase some sample data products and describe the first
science results on CO-isotopologue line ratios. These vary dramatically across
the Galactic Plane, indicating a very wide range of optical depth and
excitation conditions, from warm and translucent to cold and opaque. The
population of cold clouds in particular have optical depths for $^{12}$CO
easily exceeding 100. We derive a new, nonlinear conversion law from $^{12}$CO
integrated intensity to column density, which suggests that the molecular mass
traced by CO in the Galactic disk may have been substantially underestimated.
This further suggests that some global relationships in disk galaxies, such as
star formation laws, may need to be recalibrated. The large ThrUMMS team is
proceeding with several other science investigations.

detections made by the pipeline with the expectation from the set of simulated
planets, and construct a sensitivity curve of signal recovery as a function of
the signal-to-noise of the simulated transit signal train. The sensitivity
curve does not meet the hypothetical maximum detection efficiency, however it
is not as pessimistic as some of the published estimates of the detection

perform a simplified occurrence rate calculation using the measured detection

interferometric observations at $3 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$ from a deep and
narrow survey with SKA1-LOW, the sum of the neutrino masses can be measured
with an error $\sigma(M_\nu)\lesssim0.3$ eV (95% CL). Similar constraints can
be obtained with a wide and deep SKA1-MID survey at $z \lesssim 3$, using the
single-dish mode. By combining data from MID, LOW, and Planck, plus priors on
cosmological parameters from a Stage IV spectroscopic galaxy survey, the sum of
the neutrino masses can be determined with an error $\sigma(M_\nu)\simeq0.06$
eV (95% CL).

small-world (they have both a large local clustering coefficient and a small

the first subquadratic time algorithm for computing a (worst-case) batch of
Hamming distances in superlogarithmic dimensions, exactly. To illustrate, let

participation, performance, and attitudes toward physics. We have three
critiques of this work: (1) it does not question whether the achievements of
men are the most appropriate standard, (2) individual experiences and student
identities are undervalued, and (3) the binary model of gender is not
questioned. Driven by these critiques, we propose a conception of gender that
is more up-to-date with other fields and discuss gender-as-performance as an
extended example. We also discuss work on the intersection of identities [e.g.,
gender with race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, lesbian, gay, bisexual,
and transgender (LGBT) status], much of which has been conducted outside of
physics. Within PER, some studies examine the intersection of gender and race,
and identify the lack of a single identity as a key challenge of ""belonging"" in
physics. Acknowledging this complexity enables us to further critique what we
term a binary gender deficit model. This framework, which is implicit in much
of the gender-based PER, casts gender as a fixed binary trait and suggests that
women are deficient in characteristics necessary to succeed. Alternative models
of gender allow a greater range and fluidity of gender identities, and
highlight deficiencies in data that exclude women's experiences. We suggest new
investigations that diverge from this expanded gender framework in PER.

Furthermore, there is often a gap between the type of assistance that a theorem

KeYmaera, a deductive verification tool for differential dynamic logic; the new
technique allows local reasoning using system designer intuition about per-

the theorem prover to leverage for- ward invariants, discovered using numerical
techniques, as part of a proof of safety. We introduce a new inference rule
into the proof calculus of KeYmaera, the forward invariant cut rule, and we
present a methodology to discover useful forward invariants, which are then
used with the new cut rule to complete verification tasks. We demonstrate how
our new approach can be used to complete verification tasks that lie out of the
reach of existing deductive approaches us- ing several examples, including one

prevailing type of data. Functional Data Analysis (FDA) encompasses the
statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the
analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper
provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as
mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most
popular of which is Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an
important dimension reduction tool and in sparse data situations can be used to
impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction
approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique,
functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of
functional data. Beyond linear and single or multiple index methods we touch
upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications.
They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models, such as

transients in deep images from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova program
(DES-SN) in its first observing season from Aug 2013 through Feb 2014. DES-SN
is a search for transients in which ten 3-deg^2 fields are repeatedly observed
in the g,r,i,z passbands with a cadence of about 1 week. The observing strategy
has been optimized to measure high-quality light curves and redshifts for
thousands of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) with the goal of measuring dark energy
parameters. The essential DiffImg functions are to align each search image to a
deep reference image, do a pixel-by-pixel subtraction, and then examine the
subtracted image for significant positive detections of point-source objects.
The vast majority of detections are subtraction artifacts, but after selection
requirements and image filtering with an automated scanning program, there are
130 detections per deg^2 per observation in each band, of which only 25% are
artifacts. Of the 7500 transients discovered by DES-SN in its first observing
season, each requiring a detection on at least 2 separate nights, Monte Carlo
simulations predict that 27% are expected to be supernova. Another 30% of the
transients are artifacts, and most of the remaining transients are AGN and
variable stars. Fake SNe Ia are overlaid onto the images to rigorously evaluate
detection efficiencies, and to understand the DiffImg performance. The DiffImg
efficiency measured with fake SNe agrees well with expectations from a Monte
Carlo simulation that uses analytical calculations of the fluxes and their
uncertainties. In our 8 ""shallow"" fields with single-epoch 50% completeness
depth 23.5, the SN Ia efficiency falls to 1/2 at redshift z 0.7, in our 2

antenna arrays have become a hot topic of wireless communications. Compared to
the LTE based 4G mobile communication system that allows for up to 8 antenna
elements at the base station (BS), the LS-MIMO system entails an unprecedented
number of antennas, say 100 or more, at the BS. The huge leap in the number of
BS antennas opens the door to a new research field in communication theory,
propagation and electronics, where random matrix theory begins to play a
dominant role.
  In this paper, we provide a recital on the historic heritages and novel
challenges facing LS-MIMOs from a detection perspective. Firstly, we highlight
the fundamentals of MIMO detection, including the nature of co-channel
interference, the generality of the MIMO detection problem, the received signal
models of both linear memoryless MIMO channels and dispersive MIMO channels
exhibiting memory, as well as the complex-valued versus real-valued MIMO system
models. Then, an extensive review of the representative MIMO detection methods
conceived during the past 50 years (1965-2015) is presented, and relevant
insights as well as lessons are inferred for designing complexity-scalable MIMO
detection algorithms that are potentially applicable to LS-MIMO systems.
Furthermore, we divide the LS-MIMO systems into two types, and elaborate on the
distinct detection strategies suitable for each of them. The type-I LS-MIMO
corresponds to the case where the number of active users is much smaller than
the number of BS antennas, which is currently the mainstream definition of
LS-MIMO. The type-II LS-MIMO corresponds to the case where the number of active
users is comparable to the number of BS antennas. Finally, we discuss the
applicability of existing MIMO detection algorithms in LS-MIMO systems, and
review some of the recent advances in LS-MIMO detection.

from relativistic fluids involved in, e.g., gamma-ray bursts and active
galactic nuclei. The code is based on the spherical harmonic discrete ordinate
method (SHDOM) that evaluates a source function including anisotropic
scattering in spherical harmonics and implicitly solves the static radiative
transfer equation with a ray tracing in discrete ordinates. We implement
treatments of time dependence, multi-frequency bins, Lorentz transformation,
and elastic Thomson and inelastic Compton scattering to the publicly available
SHDOM code. Our code adopts a mixed frame approach; the source function is
evaluated in the comoving frame whereas the radiative transfer equation is
solved in the laboratory frame. This implementation is validated with various
test problems and comparisons with results of a relativistic Monte Carlo code.
These validations confirm that the code correctly calculates intensity and its
evolution in the computational domain. The code enables us to obtain an
Eddington tensor that relates first and third moments of intensity (energy
density and radiation pressure) and is frequently used as a closure relation in
radiation hydrodynamics calculations.

infinite number of conserved charges. The agreement between theory and

the fractional anisotropy (FA) computed from the eigenvalues of each web scheme
as a void tracer. We identify voids using a watershed transform based on the
local minima of the FA field without making any assumption on the shape or
structure of the voids. We test the method on the Bolshoi simulation and report
on the abundance and radial averaged profiles for the density, velocity and
fractional anisotropy. We find that voids in the velocity shear web are smaller
than voids in the tidal web, with a particular overabundance of very small
voids in the inner region of filaments/sheets. We classify voids as
subcompensated/overcompansated depending on the absence/presence of an
overdense matter ridge in their density profile, finding that close to $65\%$

from the radially averaged profiles for density, velocity and fractional

machine learning. The Mondrian process is a guillotine-partition-valued
stochastic process that possesses an elegant self-consistency property. The
first part of the report uses simple concepts from applied probability to
define the Mondrian process and explore its properties.
  The Mondrian process has been used as the main building block of a clever
online random forest classification algorithm that turns out to be equivalent
to its batch counterpart. We outline a slight adaptation of this algorithm to
regression, as the remainder of the report uses regression as a case study of
how Mondrian processes can be utilized in machine learning. In particular, the
Mondrian process will be used to construct a fast approximation to the
computationally expensive kernel ridge regression problem with a Laplace
kernel.
  The complexity of random guillotine partitions generated by a Mondrian
process and hence the complexity of the resulting regression models is
controlled by a lifetime hyperparameter. It turns out that these models can be
efficiently trained and evaluated for all lifetimes in a given range at once,
without needing to retrain them from scratch for each lifetime value. This
leads to an efficient procedure for determining the right model complexity for
a dataset at hand.
  The limitation of having a single lifetime hyperparameter will motivate the
final Mondrian grid model, in which each input dimension is endowed with its
own lifetime parameter. In this model we preserve the property that its
hyperparameters can be tweaked without needing to retrain the modified model
from scratch.

as a period of extremely low solar activity, claims are still debated that
solar activity during that period might still have been moderate, even higher
than the current solar cycle #24. We have revisited all the existing pieces of
evidence and datasets, both direct and indirect, to assess the level of solar
activity during the Maunder minimum.
  Methods: We discuss the East Asian naked-eye sunspot observations, the
telescopic solar observations, the fraction of sunspot active days, the
latitudinal extent of sunspot positions, auroral sightings at high latitudes,
cosmogenic radionuclide data as well as solar eclipse observations for that
period. We also consider peculiar features of the Sun (very strong hemispheric
asymmetry of sunspot location, unusual differential rotation and the lack of
the K-corona) that imply a special mode of solar activity during the Maunder
minimum.
  Results: The level of solar activity during the Maunder minimum is reassessed
on the basis of all available data sets.
  Conclusions: We conclude that solar activity was indeed at an exceptionally
low level during the Maunder minimum. Although the exact level is still
unclear, it was definitely below that during the Dalton minimum around 1800 and
significantly below that of the current solar cycle #24. Claims of a
moderate-to-high level of solar activity during the Maunder minimum are
rejected at a high confidence level.

Model is built from magnetic dipolar interaction and demagnetizing mean field
concepts. A useful expression for effective demagnetizing factors is achieved,
which allows for the analysis of non uniform spatial distributions of
nanoparticles. This expression is a function of demagnetizing factors
associated with specimen and clusters shapes, and of the mean distances between
near neighbor nanoparticles and between clusters, relative to the
characteristic sizes of each of these two types of objects, respectively. It
explains effects of magnetic dipolar interactions such as the observation of
apparent nanoparticle magnetic-moments smaller than real ones. It is shown that
by performing a minimum set of experimental determinations, model application
allows retrieval of intrinsic properties, like magnetic moment and
susceptibility in the absence of interactions. It also permits the estimation
of mean interparticle and intercluster relative distances, and of demagnetizing
factors associated with clusters shape. An expression for magnetic dipolar

"1507.05195","Hiraku Kawanoue","Hiraku Kawanoue and Kenji Matsuki","A new strategy for resolution of singularities in the monomial case in
  positive characteristic","This is the revised version submitted to Revista Matem\'atica
  Iberoamericana",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  According to our approach for resolution of singularities in positive
characteristic (called the Idealistic Filtration Program, alias the I.F.P. for
short) the algorithm is devided into the following two steps: Step 1. Reduction
of the general case to the monomial case. Step 2. Solution in the monomial
case. While we have established Step 1 in arbitrary dimension, Step 2 becomes
very subtle and difficult in positive characteristic. This is in clear contrast
to the classical setting in characteristic zero, where the solution in the
monomial case is quite easy. In dimension 3, we provided an invariant in the
previous paper, inspired by the work of Benito-Villamayor, which establishes
Step 2. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to approach Step 2, and
provide a different invariant in dimension 3 based upon this strategy. The new
invariant increases from time to time (the well-known Moh-Hauser jumping
phoenomena), while it is then shown to eventually decrease. (The analysis of
the jumping phoenomena and eventual decrease is done in the monomial case in
our setting, while the classical analysis by Moh or Hauser is done in a
different setting without any reference to the monomial case. Therefore, even
though we owe most of the ideas to Moh and Hauser, our argument is carried out
logically independent of their papers.) Since the old invariant in our previous
paper strictly decreases after each transformation, this may look like a step
backward rather than forward. However, the construction of the new invariant is
more faithful to the original philosophy of Villamayor, and we believe that the
new strategy has a better fighting chance in higher dimensions.

John von Neumann enumerated them as 1, the ""discontinuous ... arbitrary changes

That the physical world does not obey a single overriding law - unitary
evolution by the Schroedinger Equation - is philosophically disturbing to some.
Others face it with equanimity. One narrative that preserves the findings of
quantum mechanics yet does produce pure unitary evolution is that of the
multiverse. Given below is the narrative by which Born's Rule emerges without
pre-assigning to it the notion of probability. It requires that the number of
universes in the multiverse not be enumerable!

formed of convex grains the interior grains are polyhedral, while for
polycrystals with general grain geometry the set of triple points is small.
Then we investigate possible martensitic morphologies resulting from intergrain
contact. For cubic-to-tetragonal transformations we show that homogeneous
zero-energy microstructures matching a pure dilatation on a grain boundary
necessarily involve more than four deformation gradients. We discuss the
relevance of this result for observations of microstructures involving second
and third-order laminates in various materials. Finally we consider the more
specialized situation of bicrystals formed from materials having two
martensitic energy wells (such as for orthorhombic to monoclinic
transformations), but without any restrictions on the possible microstructure,
showing how a generalization of the Hadamard jump condition can be applied at
the intergrain boundary to show that a pure phase in either grain is impossible
at minimum energy.

equation for the sea ice thickness distribution $g(h)$ due to Thorndike et al.,
(1975) into a Fokker-Planck like conservation law. The steady solution is $g(h)
= {\cal N}(q) h^q \mathrm{e}^{-~ h/H}$, where $q$ and $H$ are expressible in
terms of moments over the transition probabilities between thickness
categories. The solution exhibits the functional form used in observational
fits and shows that for $h \ll 1$, $g(h)$ is controlled by both thermodynamics
and mechanics, whereas for $h \gg 1$ only mechanics controls $g(h)$. Finally,
we derive the underlying Langevin equation governing the dynamics of the ice
thickness $h$, from which we predict the observed $g(h)$. The genericity of our
approach provides a framework for studying the geophysical scale structure of
the ice pack using methods of broad relevance in statistical mechanics.

within our own galaxy) might be experimentally accessible in some manner. We
point out, using the Pioneer satellites as an example, that current satellite
technology allows for this possibility within time scales of less than one

physical meaning for such an analytic continuation in terms of a family of
closely related inhomogeneous media. For bounded permittivity profiles we find
the phenomenon of reflection can be related to branch cuts in the wave that
originate from poles of the permittivity at complex positions. Demanding that
these branch cuts disappear, we derive a large family of inhomogeneous media
that are reflectionless for a single angle of incidence. Extending this
property to all angles of incidence leads us to a generalized form of the
Poschl Teller potentials. We conclude by analyzing our findings within the
phase integral (WKB) method.

with image phase as a building block for efficient and robust image
reconstruction with phase constraints. Theory and Methods: ESPIRiT is a new
framework for calibration of the coil sensitivities and reconstruction in
parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Applying ESPIRiT to a combined set
of physical and virtual conjugate coils (VCC-ESPIRiT) implicitly exploits
conjugate symmetry in k-space similar to VCC-GRAPPA. Based on this method, a
new post-processing step is proposed for the explicit computation of coil
sensitivities that include the absolute phase of the image. The accuracy of the
computed maps is directly validated using a test based on projection onto fully
sampled coil images and also indirectly in phase-constrained parallel-imaging
reconstructions. Results: The proposed method can estimate accurate
sensitivities which include low-resolution image phase. In case of
high-frequency phase variations VCC-ESPIRiT yields an additional set of maps
that indicates the existence of a high-frequency phase component. Taking this
additional set of maps into account can improve the robustness of
phase-constrained parallel imaging. Conclusion: The extended VCC-ESPIRiT is a
useful tool for phase-constrained imaging.
