effective bioactive wound dressings is anticipated for the treatment of
infected chronic wounds. Naturally derived antibacterial agents, such as Manuka
honey, consist of a mixture of compounds, more than one of which can influence
antimicrobial potency. The non-peroxide bacteriostatic properties of Manuka
honey have been previously linked to the presence of methylglyoxal (MGO). The
incorporation of MGO as a functional antibacterial additive during fibre
production was explored as a potential route for manufacturing wound dressing
components. Synthetic MGO and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were fabricated into webs
of sub-micron fibres by means of electrostatic spinning of an aqueous spinning
solution. Composite fabrics were also produced by direct deposition of the
PVA-MGO fibres onto a preformed spunbonded nonwoven substrate. Attenuated Total
Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (<p><sup>1</sup>H-NMR) spectroscopies confirmed the presence of MGO
within the resulting fibre structure. The antibacterial activity of the fibres
was studied using strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Strong
antibacterial activity, as well as diffusion of MGO from the fibres was
observed at a concentration of 1.55mg/<p>cm<sup>-1</sup>.

level proceeds via the creation of a $J/\psi$ meson and an excited $sud$ system
with $I=0$, which upon hadronization leads to $\bar K N$ or $\eta \Lambda$
pairs. These states undergo final state interaction in coupled channels and
produce a final meson-baryon pair. The $K \Xi$ state only occurs via
rescattering, hence making the $\Lambda_b \to J/\psi ~ K ~ \Xi$ process very
sensitive to the details of the meson-baryon interaction in strangeness $S=-1$

is dominated by the next-to-leading order terms of the chiral interaction. The
$I=0$ selectivity of this decay, and its large sensitivity to the higher order

makes users unable to appropriately control to whom these items are actually

preferences of multiple users into a single policy for an item can help solve
this problem. However, merging multiple users' privacy preferences is not an
easy task, because privacy preferences may conflict, so methods to resolve

propose solutions that can be acceptable by all of the users affected by the

problem, where the $m$ sets that comprise the instance are to be read one by
one. A semi-streaming algorithm is allowed only $O(n\, \mathrm{poly}\{\log n,

simple deterministic algorithm that makes $p$ passes over the input stream and
returns an appropriately certified $(p+1)n^{1/(p+1)}$-approximation to the
optimum set cover. More importantly, we proceed to show that this approximation
factor is essentially tight, by showing that a factor better than
$0.99\,n^{1/(p+1)}/(p+1)^2$ is unachievable for a $p$-pass semi-streaming
algorithm, even allowing randomisation. In particular, this implies that
achieving a $\Theta(\log n)$-approximation requires $\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)$
passes, which is tight up to the $\log\log n$ factor. These results extend to a
relaxation of the set cover problem where we are allowed to leave an
$\varepsilon$ fraction of the universe uncovered: the tight bounds on the best
approximation factor achievable in $p$ passes turn out to be
$\Theta_p(\min\{n^{1/(p+1)}, \varepsilon^{-1/p}\})$. Our lower bounds are based
on a construction of a family of high-rank incidence geometries, which may be

current industry practice. Our results suggest that models from the
$k$-$\epsilon$ family are more accurate in predicting swirling flows than
models from the $k$-$\omega$ family. For sufficiently resolved meshes, the
realizable $k$-$\epsilon$ model provides the most accurate approximation of the
velocity magnitudes, although it fails to capture small-scale flow structures
which are accurately predicted by the standard $k$-$\epsilon$ model and the RNG
$k$-$\epsilon$ model. Throughout the article, we highlight practical guidance

\hdots \leq \lambda_n$ denote the curvature eigenvalues and $\kappa$ is a
nonnegative constant. This defines a fully nonlinear parabolic equation,
provided that $\lambda_1+\lambda_2>2\kappa$. In contrast to mean curvature
flow, this flow preserves the condition $\lambda_1+\lambda_2>2\kappa$ in a
general ambient manifold.
  Our main goal in this paper is to extend the surgery algorithm of
Huisken-Sinestrari to this fully nonlinear flow. This is the first construction
of this kind for a fully nonlinear flow. As a corollary, we show that a compact
Riemannian manifold satisfying $\overline{R}_{1313}+\overline{R}_{2323} \geq
-2\kappa^2$ with non-empty boundary satisfying $\lambda_1+\lambda_2 > 2\kappa$
is diffeomorphic to a $1$-handlebody.
  The main technical advance is the pointwise curvature derivative estimate.
The proof of this estimate requires a new argument, as the existing techniques
for mean curvature flow due to Huisken-Sinestrari, Haslhofer-Kleiner, and Brian
White cannot be generalized to the fully nonlinear setting. To establish this
estimate, we employ an induction-on-scales argument; this relies on a
combination of several ingredients, including the almost convexity estimate,
the inscribed radius estimate, as well as a regularity result for radial
graphs. We expect that this technique will be useful in other situations as
well.

the desirable case where neither the independent system operator (ISO) needs to
know the dynamics/utilities of the agents, nor do the agents need to have a

communication between the ISO and agents is restricted to the ISO announcing a
pricing policy and the agents responding with their energy

  We provide a complete solution for both the deterministic and stochastic

social welfare. We also provide an optimal solution for the case where there is
a common randomness affecting and observed by all agents. This solution can be
computationally complex, and we pose approximations. For the more general
partially observed randomness case, we exhibit a relaxation that significantly
reduces complexity. We also provide an approximation strategy that leads to a
model predictive control (MPC) approach. Simulation results comparing the
resulting optimal demand response with the existing architectures employed by
the ISO illustrate the benefit in social welfare utility realized by our
scheme. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work of its

from a primary star in the AGB phase. We investigate the mechanism of mass
transfer and the process of nucleosynthesis in low-metallicity AGB stars by
modelling the binary systems in which the observed CEMP-$s$ stars were formed.
For this purpose we compare a sample of $67$ CEMP-$s$ stars with a grid of
binary stars generated by our binary evolution and nucleosynthesis model. We
classify our sample CEMP-$s$ stars in three groups based on the observed
abundance of europium. In CEMP$-s/r$ stars the europium-to-iron ratio is more
than ten times higher than in the Sun, whereas it is lower than this threshold
in CEMP$-s/nr$ stars. No measurement of europium is currently available for
CEMP-$s/ur$ stars. On average our models reproduce well the abundances observed
in CEMP-$s/nr$ stars, whereas in CEMP-$s/r$ stars and CEMP-$s/ur$ stars the
abundances of the light-$s$ elements are systematically overpredicted by our
models and in CEMP-$s/r$ stars the abundances of the heavy-$s$ elements are
underestimated. In all stars our modelled abundances of sodium overestimate the
observations. This discrepancy is reduced only in models that underestimate the
abundances of most of the $s$-elements. Furthermore, the abundance of lead is
underpredicted in most of our model stars. These results point to the
limitations of our AGB nucleosynthesis model, particularly in the predictions
of the element-to-element ratios. Finally, in our models CEMP-$s$ stars are
typically formed in wide systems with periods above 10000 days, while most of
the observed CEMP-$s$ stars are found in relatively close orbits with periods
below 5000 days.

by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014)
and by the Gaia Science Alerts project, during two separate outbursts. A third
outburst is seen in archival Pan-STARRS-1 (PS1; Schlafly et al. 2012; Tonry et
al. 2012; Magnier et al. 2013) and ASAS-SN data. Spectroscopy reveals a hot,
hydrogen-deficient spectrum with clear double-peaked emission lines, consistent
with an accreting double degenerate classification. We use follow-up photometry
to constrain the orbital parameters of the system. We find an orbital period of
49.71 min, which places Gaia14aae at the long period extremum of the
outbursting AM CVn period distribution. Gaia14aae is dominated by the light
from its accreting white dwarf. Assuming an orbital inclination of 90 degrees
for the binary system, the contact phases of the white dwarf lead to lower
limits of 0.78 M solar and 0.015 M solar on the masses of the accretor and
donor respectively and a lower limit on the mass ratio of 0.019. Gaia14aae is
only the third eclipsing AM CVn star known, and the first in which the WD is
totally eclipsed. Using a helium WD model, we estimate the accretor's effective
temperature to be 12900+-200 K. The three out-burst events occurred within 4
months of each other, while no other outburst activity is seen in the previous
8 years of Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS; Drake et al. 2009),
Pan-STARRS-1 and ASAS-SN data. This suggests that these events might be
rebrightenings of the first outburst rather than individual events.

Dir-MC admits a $2$-approximation [Naor, Zosin '97] and Node-MC admits a
$2(1-\frac{1}{k})$-approximation [Garg, Vazirani, Yannakakis '94], both via
rounding of LP relaxations. Previous rounding algorithms for these problems,
from nearly twenty years ago, are based on careful rounding of an ""optimum""

the rounding relies on a custom LP formulation instead of the natural distance
based LP relaxation [Naor, Zosin '97].
  In this paper we describe extremely simple and near linear-time rounding
algorithms for Dir-MC and Node-MC via a natural distance based LP relaxation.
The dual of this relaxation is a special case of the maximum multicommodity
flow problem. Our algorithms achieve the same bounds as before but have the
significant advantage in that they can work with ""any feasible"" solution to the
relaxation. Consequently, in addition to obtaining ""book"" proofs of LP rounding
for these two basic problems, we also obtain significantly faster approximation
algorithms by taking advantage of known algorithms for computing near-optimal
solutions for maximum multicommodity flow problems. We also investigate lower
bounds for Dir-MC when $k=2$ and in particular prove that the integrality gap
of the LP relaxation is $2$ even in directed planar graphs.

to $m_{v}^{\ast}(\rho_0)=(0.80\pm0.03) m$ and reduces the linear isospin

identify topological order in classical systems. Like for their quantum
counterparts, the presence of topological order can be identified in such
classical systems via a universal, subleading contribution to the prevalent
volume and boundary laws of the classical R\'enyi entropies. We demonstrate
that an additional subleading $O(1)$ contribution generically arises for all
R\'enyi entropies $S^{(n)}$ with $n \geq 2$ when driving the system towards a
phase transition, e.g. into a conventionally ordered phase. This additional
subleading term, which we dub connectivity contribution, tracks back to partial
subsystem ordering and is proportional to the number of connected parts in a
given bipartition. Notably, the Levin-Wen summation scheme -- typically used to
extract the topological contribution to the R\'enyi entropies -- does not fully
eliminate this additional connectivity contribution in this classical context.
This indicates that the distillation of topological order from R\'enyi
entropies requires an additional level of scrutiny to distinguish topological
from non-topological $O(1)$ contributions. This is also the case for quantum
systems, for which we discuss which entropies are sensitive to these
connectivity contributions. We showcase these findings by extensive numerical

even-mass neutron-rich isotopes of molybdenum and ruthenium nuclei have been
measured. The new data have provided a challenge for theoretical descriptions
invoking stable triaxial deformations.
  Purpose: To understand experimental data on rotational bands in the
neutron-rich Mo-Ru region, we carried out theoretical analysis of moments of
inertia, shapes, and transition quadrupole moments of neutron-rich even-even
nuclei around $^{110}$Ru using self-consistent mean-field and shell model
techniques.
  Methods: To describe yrast structures in Mo and Ru isotopes, we use nuclear
Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the optimized energy density functional
UNEDF0. We also apply Triaxial Projected Shell Model (TPSM) to describe yrast
and positive-parity, near-yrast band structures.
  Results: Our self-consistent DFT calculations predict triaxial ground-state
deformations in $^{106,108}$Mo and $^{108.110,112}$Ru and reproduce the
observed low-frequency behavior of moments of inertia. As the rotational
frequency increases, a negative-$\gamma$ structure, associated with the aligned
$\nu(h_{11/2})^2$ pair, becomes energetically favored. The computed transition
quadrupole moments vary with angular momentum, which reflects deformation
changes with rotation; those variations are consistent with experiment. The
TPSM calculations explain the observed band structures assuming stable triaxial
shapes.
  Conclusions: The structure of neutron-rich even-even nuclei around $^{110}$Ru
is consistent with triaxial shape deformations. Our DFT and TPSM frameworks
provide a consistent and complementary description of experimental data.

find a new unique complex-valued index $\chi$ that characterizes almost the

Continuously varying the index $\chi$, predictions interpolate from
quadratic/natural inflation parameterized by a phase/axion decay constant to
Starobinsky-like inflation parameterized by the $\alpha$-parameter. We
demonstrate that the simple supergravity construction realizing
Starobinsky-like inflation can be obtained from a more microscopic model by
integrating out heavy fields, and that the flat phase direction for slow-roll
inflation is protected by a mildly broken global $U(1)$ symmetry. %, which is
mildly broken at the inflation energy scale. We study the geometrical origin of
the index $\chi$, and find that it corresponds to a linear constraint relating
\kah moduli. We argue that such a linear constraint is a natural result of
moduli stabilization in Type \MyRoman{2} orientifold compactifications on
Calabi-Yau threefolds with geometric and non-geometric fluxes. Possible choices
for the index $\chi$ are discrete points on the complex plane that relate to
the distribution of supersymmetric Minkowski vacua on moduli space. More
precise observations of the inflationary epoch in the future may provide a
better estimation of the index $\chi$. Since $\chi$ is determined by the fluxes

operator is rendered as a multiple phase space integral of the product of their
Weyl symbols with the Wigner function. Interspersing the factors with various
evolution operators, one obtains an evolving correlation. The kernel for the
matching multiple integral that evolves within the Weyl representation is
identified with the trace of a single compound unitary operator. Its evaluation
within a semiclassical approximation then becomes a sum over the periodic
trajectories of the corresponding classical compound canonical transformation.
  The search for periodic trajectories can be bypassed by an exactly equivalent
initial value scheme, which involves a change of integration variable and a
reduced compound unitary operator. Restriction of all the operators to
observables with smooth non-oscillatory Weyl symbols reduces the evolving
correlation to a single phase space integral. If each observable undergoes
independent Heisenberg evolution, the overall correlation evolves classically.
Otherwise, the kernel acquires a nonclassical phase factor, though it still
depends on a purely classical compound trajectory: e.g. the fase for a double
return of the quantum Loschmidt echo does not coincide with twice the phase for
a single echo.

hadronic mass spectra in reasonable consistency with experimental and (or)

and assume that gauge/ gravity duality holds in a scenario where conformal
invariance is broken through the introduction of an energy scale.
  Another important property of hadrons: the decay constant, can also be
obtained from these models. However, a consistent formulation of an AdS/QCD
model that reproduces the observed behavior of decay constants of vector meson
excited states is still lacking. In particular: for radially excited states of
heavy vector mesons, the experimental data lead to decay constants that
decrease with the radial excitation level.
  We show here that a modified framework of soft wall AdS/QCD involving an
additional dimensionfull parameter, associated with an ultraviolet energy
scale, provides decay constants decreasing with radial excitation level. In
this version of the soft wall model the two point function of gauge theory
operators is calculated at a finite position of the anti-de Sitter space radial

advance, {\it i.e.}, transient vibration and triggered slip are simultaneous.
The critical strain is order of $10^{-6}$, similar to observations in the
laboratory and in Earth. The transition is related to frictional weakening of
the granular layer due to a dramatic decrease in coordination number and the
weakening of the contact force network. Associated with this frictional
weakening is a pronounced decrease in the elastic modulus of the layer. The
study has important implications for mechanisms of triggered earthquakes and
induced seismic events and points out the underlying processes in response of
the fault gouge to dynamic transient stresses.

purely hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) regimes for two different
values of the shear $q=2.1, 4.2$ ($q = - d\ln\Omega / d\ln r$) and compare it
with the Keplerian case $q=1.5$. We find that the $q>2$ regime is unstable both
in the hydrodynamic and in the MHD limit (with an initially weak magnetic
field). In this regime, the velocity fluctuations dominate the magnetic
fluctuations. In contrast, in the $q<2$ (magnetorotational instability (MRI))
regime the magnetic fluctuations dominate. This highlights two different paths
to MHD turbulence implied by the two regimes, suggesting that in the $q>2$
regime the instability produces primarily velocity fluctuations that cause
magnetic fluctuations, with the causality reversed for the $q<2$ MRI unstable
regime. We also find that the magnetic field correlation is increasingly
localized as the shear is increased in the Rayleigh unstable regime. In
calculating the time evolution of spatial averages of different terms in the
MHD equations, we find that the $q>2$ regime is dominated by terms which are
nonlinear in the fluctuations, whereas for $q<2$, the linear terms play a more
significant role.

method is applied to investigate the charge neutral and non-neutral excitation
spectra of a homogeneous, two-site, two-electron Holstein model. This is an
extension of a previous study of the ground state properties in the Hartree
(H), partially self-consistent Born (Gd) and fully self-consistent Born (GD)
approximations published in Ref. [arXiv:1403.2968]. We show that choosing a
homogeneous ground state solution leads to unstable dynamics for a sufficiently
strong interaction, and that allowing a symmetry-broken state prevents this.
The instability is caused by the bifurcation of the ground state and understood
physically to be connected with the bipolaronic crossover of the exact system.
This mean-field instability persists in the partially self-consistent Born
approximation but is not found for the fully self-consistent Born
approximation. By understanding the stability properties, we are able to study
the linear response regime by calculating the density-density response function
by time-propagation. This functions amounts to a solution of the Bethe-Salpeter
equation with a sophisticated kernel. The results indicate that none of the
approximations is able to describe the response function during or beyond the
bipolaronic crossover for the parameters investigated. Overall, we provide an
extensive discussion on when the approximations are valid, and how they fail to
describe the studied exact properties of the chosen model system.

serve as regularizers in convex optimization problems arising from hierarchical
classification, multitask learning, and estimating vectors with disjoint

efficient characterizations for their convex conjugates, subdifferentials, and
proximal operators. We discuss efficient optimization algorithms for
regularized loss minimization problems where the loss admits a common, yet
simple, variational representation and the regularizer is a VGF. These
algorithms enjoy a simple kernel trick, an efficient line search, as well as
computational advantages over first order methods based on the subdifferential

set of candidate quantum states with the minimum average error probability
allowed by quantum mechanics. Conditions for a measurement to be MPE were
derived by Yuen, Kennedy and Lax (YKL). MPE measurements have been found for
states that form a single orbit under a group action, i.e., there is a
transitive group action on the states in the set. For such state sets, termed
geometrically uniform (GU) by Forney, it was shown that the `pretty good
measurement' (PGM) attains the MPE. Even so, evaluating the actual probability
of error (and other performance metrics) attained by the PGM on a GU set
involves inverting large matrices, and is not easy in general. Our first
contribution is a formula for the MPE and conditional probabilities of GU sets,
using group representation theory. Next, we consider sets of pure states that
have multiple orbits under the group action. Such states are termed compound
geometrically uniform (CGU). MPE measurements for general CGU sets are not
known. In this paper, we show how our representation-theoretic description of
optimal measurements for GU sets naturally generalizes to the CGU case. We show
how to compute the MPE measurement for CGU sets by reducing the problem to
solving a few simultaneous equations. The number of equations depends on the
sizes of the multiplicity space of irreducible representations. For many common
group representations (such as those of several practical good linear codes),
this is much more tractable than solving large semi-definite programs---which
is what is needed to solve the YKL conditions numerically for arbitrary state
sets. We show how to evaluate MPE measurements for CGU states for some examples
relevant to quantum-limited classical optical communication.

combines N-body cosmological simulations and semi-analytic techniques to

using high resolution hydrodynamical simulations, which include dark matter,
stars, cold gas in the disc and hot gas in the halo. We show that the satellite
mass accretion is not as effective as previously thought, as there is
substantial stellar stripping before the final merger. The fraction of stellar
disc mass transferred to the bulge is quite low, even in the case of a major
merger, mainly due to the dispersion of part of the stellar disc mass into the
halo. We confirm the findings of Hopkins et al., that a gas rich disc is able
to survive major mergers more efficiently. The enhanced star formation
associated with the merger is not localised to the bulge of galaxy, but a
substantial fraction takes place in the disc too. The inclusion of the hot gas
reservoir in the galaxy model contributes to reducing the efficiency of bulge
formation. Overall, our findings suggest that mergers are not as efficient as
previously thought in transforming discs into bulges. This possibly alleviates
some of the tensions between observations of bulgeless galaxies and the
hierarchical scenario for structure formation.

another two have eccentricities that place them in the extreme upper tail of

largest astronomical surveys like PanStarrs, DES, J-PAS or the LSST, require
precise measurements of galaxy photometry in different bands using a consistent
physical aperture. This is not trivial, due to the variation in the shape and
width of the Point Spread Function (PSF) introduced by wavelength differences,
instrument positions and atmospheric conditions. Current methods to correct for
this effect rely on a detailed knowledge of the PSF characteristics as a
function of the survey coordinates, which can be difficult due to the relative
paucity of stars tracking the PSF behaviour. Here we show that it is possible
to measure accurate, consistent multicolour photometry without knowing the
shape of PSF. The Chebyshev-Fourier Functions (CHEFs) can fit the observed
profile of each object and produce high signal-to-noise integrated flux
measurements unaffected by the PSF. These total fluxes, which encompass all the
galaxy populations, are much more useful for Galaxy Evolution studies than
aperture photometry. We compare the total magnitudes and colours obtained using
our software to traditional photometry with SExtractor, using real data from
the COSMOS survey and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. We also apply the CHEFs
technique to the recently published Extreme Deep Field and compare the results

  We introduce for that purpose a new open-source addition to the Mercury
N-body code, Mercury-T, which takes into account tides, general relativity and
the effect of rotation-induced flattening in order to simulate the dynamical
and tidal evolution of multi-planet systems. It uses a standard equilibrium
tidal model, the constant time lag model. Besides, the evolution of the radius
of several host bodies has been implemented (brown dwarfs, M-dwarfs of mass
$0.1~M_\odot$, Sun-like stars, Jupiter). We validate the new code by comparing
its output for one-planet systems to the secular equations results. We find
that this code does respect the conservation of total angular momentum.
  We applied this new tool to the planetary system Kepler-62. We find that
tides influence the stability of the system in some cases. We also show that
while the four inner planets of the systems are likely to have slow rotation
rates and small obliquities, the fifth planet could have a fast rotation rate
and a high obliquity. This means that the two habitable zone planets of this
system, Kepler-62e ad f are likely to have very different climate features, and
this of course would influence their potential at hosting surface liquid water.

be point particles even though in reality they are finite-sized objects. In
this paper, we generalize the fluid equation approximation to halos to include
the finite extent of halos by taking into account the halo profile. We compute
the perturbation of the halo density and velocity field to second order and
find that the profile correction gives rise to $k^2$ correction terms in
Fourier space. These corrections are more important for velocity than for
density. In particular, the profile correction generates $k^2$ correction term
in the velocity bias and the correction terms do not decay away in the long
term limit, but it is not constant. We model the halo profile evolution using
the spherical collapse model. We also measure the evolution of proto-halo
profile at various redshifts numerically. We find that the spherical collapse
model gives a reasonable description of the numerical profile evolution. Static
halo profile is often adopted in modelling halos in theories such as the
excursion set theory. Our work highlights the importance of including the

super-horizon degrees of freedom, which is argued to generically exist in a
near de Sitter space-time. The modes have a simple factorized form which leads
to factorization of the squeezed-limit correlation functions with power-law

explore scenarios leading to further volatile loss and associated C/N

include relative enrichment of nitrogen in the atmosphere and preferential
sequestration of carbon by the core. The high C/N BSE ratio therefore is best
satisfied by accretion of thermally processed objects followed by large-scale

variables, using traditional techniques for numerically finding a semi-global
solution to an HJB equation for general nonlinear systems is infeasible due to
the curse of dimensionality. Here we present a new computational method for
finding feedback optimal control and solving HJB equations which is able to
mitigate the curse of dimensionality. We do not discretize the HJB equation
directly, instead we introduce a sparse grid in the state space and use the
Pontryagin's maximum principle to derive a set of necessary conditions in the
form of a boundary value problem, also known as the characteristic equations,
for each grid point. Using this approach, the method is spatially causality
free, which enjoys the advantage of perfect parallelism on a sparse grid.
Compared with dense grids, a sparse grid has a significantly reduced size which
is feasible for systems with relatively high dimensions, such as the $6$-D
system shown in the examples. Once the solution obtained at each grid point,
high-order accurate polynomial interpolation is used to approximate the
feedback control at arbitrary points. We prove an upper bound for the
approximation error and approximate it numerically. This sparse grid

approach, the quantum degrees of freedom are described by a wave function which
evolves according to some Schr\""odinger equation with a Hamiltonian that
depends on the classical degrees of freedom. The classical degrees of freedom
satisfy classical equations that depend on the expectation values of quantum
operators. In this paper, we study an alternative approach based on Bohmian
mechanics. In Bohmian mechanics the quantum system is not only described by the
wave function, but also with additional variables such as particle positions or
fields. By letting the classical equations of motion depend on these variables,
rather than the quantum expectation values, a semi-classical approximation is
obtained that is closer to the exact quantum results than the usual approach.
We discuss the Bohmian semi-classical approximation in various contexts, such
as non-relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics and quantum
gravity. The main motivation comes from quantum gravity. The quest for a
quantum theory for gravity is still going on. Therefore a semi-classical
approach where gravity is treated classically may be an approximation that
already captures some quantum gravitational aspects. The Bohmian semi-classical
theories will be derived from the full Bohmian theories. In the case there are
gauge symmetries, like in quantum electrodynamics or quantum gravity, special
care is required. In order to derive a consistent semi-classical theory it will
be necessary to isolate gauge-independent dependent degrees of freedom from

over the category of sup-lattices, associated with an arbitrary Grothendieck
topos, and the attainment of new results in tannakian representation theory
from it.
  Although many results were obtained and published historically linking Galois
and Tannaka theory (see our introduction), these are different and less general
since they assume the existence of Galois closures and work on Galois topos
rather than on arbitrary topos. Instead we, when talking about Galois theory,
mean the extension to arbitrary topos of Joyal and Tierney, critical to get the
results of this thesis.
  The tannakian context associated with a Grothendieck topos is obtained
through the process of taking relations of its localic cover. Then, through an
investigation and exhaustive comparison of the constructions of the Galois and
Tannaka theories, we prove the equivalence of their fundamental recognition
theorems (see section 8).
  Since the (bi)categories of relations of a Grothendieck topos were
characterized by Carboni and Walters, a new recognition-type tannakian theorem
(theorem 8.12) is obtained, essentially different from those known so far.

behavior is studied for continuous-time multi-agent systems. The agents' task
is to drive their center to track an optimal trajectory which minimizes the sum
of local time-varying cost functions through local interaction, while
maintaining connectivity and avoiding inter-agent collision. Each local cost
function is only known to an individual agent and the team's optimal solution
is time-varying. Here two cases are considered, single-integrator dynamics and
double-integrator dynamics. For each case, a distributed convex optimization
algorithm with swarm tracking behavior is proposed where each agent relies only
on its own position and the relative positions (and velocities in the
double-integrator case) between itself and its neighbors. It is shown that the
center of the agents tracks the optimal trajectory, the the connectivity of the
agents will be maintained and inter-agent collision is avoided. Finally,
numerical examples are included for illustration.

societies. Signals of social identity are known to influence individual
behaviors in the adoption of innovations. Yet the population-level consequences
of identity signaling on the diffusion of innovations are largely unknown. Here
we use both analytical and agent-based modeling to consider the spread of a
beneficial innovation in a structured population in which there exist two
groups who are averse to being mistaken for each other. We investigate the
dynamics of adoption and consider the role of structural factors such as
demographic skew and communication scale on population-level outcomes. We find
that outgroup aversion can lead to adoption being delayed or suppressed in one
group, and that population-wide underadoption is common. Comparing the two
models, we find that differential adoption can arise due to structural
constraints on information flow even in the absence of intrinsic between-group
differences in adoption rates. Further, we find that patterns of polarization
in adoption at both local and global scales depend on the details of
demographic organization and the scale of communication. This research has
particular relevance to widely beneficial but identity-relevant products and
behaviors, such as green technologies, where overall levels of adoption
determine the positive benefits that accrue to society at large.

the slope of the luminosity (mass) functions does not change with the distance,

leader for networked Lagrange systems with parametric uncertainties under a

leader to maintain connectivity and avoid collisions for all time and also
eventually achieve velocity matching. In the proximity graph, the neighbor
relationship is defined according to the relative distance between each pair of
agents. Each follower is able to obtain information from only the neighbors in
its proximity, involving only local interaction. We consider two cases: i) the
leader moves with a constant velocity, and ii) the leader moves with a varying
velocity. In the first case, a distributed continuous adaptive control
algorithm accounting for unknown parameters is proposed in combination with a
distributed continuous estimator for each follower. In the second case, a
distributed discontinuous adaptive control algorithm and estimator are
proposed. Then the algorithm is extended to be fully distributed with the
introduction of gain adaptation laws. In all proposed algorithms, only one-hop
neighbors' information (e.g., the relative position and velocity measurements
between the neighbors and the absolute position and velocity measurements) is
required, and flocking is achieved as long as the connectivity and collision
avoidance are ensured at the initial time and the control gains are designed
properly. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical
results.

primary mirror can find and characterize dozens of Earth-like planets and make
fundamental advances across nearly all fields of astrophysics. The concept is
called the High Definition Space Telescope (HDST). The telescope would be
located at the Sun-Earth L2 point and would cover a spectral range that, at a
minimum, runs from 0.1 to 2 microns. Unlike JWST, HDST will not need to operate

not require servicing to complete its primary scientific objectives. We present
the scientific and technical requirements for HDST and show that it could allow
us to determine whether or not life is common outside the Solar System. We do
not propose a specific design for such a telescope, but show that designing,

agent, under local interaction with neighbors. We consider two cases. First, a
distributed discontinuous algorithm and filter are proposed, where each agent
needs the relative positions between itself and its neighbors and its
neighbors' filter outputs obtained through communication but the requirement
for either absolute or relative velocity measurements is removed. The agents'
positions and velocities must be initialized correctly, but the algorithm can
deal with a wide class of input signals with bounded acceleration deviations.

the input signals and their velocities and accelerations are all bounded.

problems used for solving linear inverse problems. We focus on the minimization
of a least-squares objective subject to a constraint defined as the sub-level
set of a penalty function. We present a unified convergence analysis of the
gradient projection algorithm applied to such problems. We sharply characterize
the convergence rate associated with a wide variety of random measurement
ensembles in terms of the number of measurements and structural complexity of
the signal with respect to the chosen penalty function. The results apply to
both convex and nonconvex constraints, demonstrating that a linear convergence
rate is attainable even though the least squares objective is not strongly
convex in these settings. When specialized to Gaussian measurements our results
show that such linear convergence occurs when the number of measurements is
merely 4 times the minimal number required to recover the desired signal at all
(a.k.a. the phase transition). We also achieve a slower but geometric rate of
convergence precisely above the phase transition point. Extensive numerical
results suggest that the derived rates exactly match the empirical performance.

repulsive due to the Coulomb interaction. However, the counterintuitive
like-charge attraction in electrolytes has been frequently observed in
experiments, which has been theoretically debated for a long time. It is widely
known that the mean field Poisson-Boltzmann theory cannot explain or predict
this anomalous feature since it ignores many-body properties. In this paper, we
develop efficient algorithm and perform the force calculation between two
interfaces using a set of self-consistent equations which properly takes into
account the electrostatic correlation and the dielectric-boundary effects. By
solving the equations and calculating the pressure with the Debye-charging
process, we show that the self-consistent equations could be used to study the
attraction between like-charge surfaces from weak-coupling to mediate-coupling
regime, and that the attraction is due to the electrostatics-driven entropic
force which is significantly enhanced by the dielectric depletion of mobile

Our approach is sound and relatively complete with respect to a first-order

verification and bug-finding tools for higher-order programs.
  To validate our approach, we use it to develop and evaluate a system for
verifying and refuting behavioral software contracts of components in a
functional language, which we call soft contract verification. In doing so, we
discover a mutually beneficial relation between behavioral contracts and
higher-order symbolic execution.
  Our system uses higher-order symbolic execution, leveraging contracts as a
source of symbolic values including unknown behavioral values, and employs an
updatable heap of contract invariants to reason about flow-sensitive facts.
Whenever a contract is refuted, it reports a concrete counterexample
reproducing the error, which may involve solving for an unknown function. The
approach is able to analyze first-class contracts, recursive data structures,
unknown functions, and control-flow-sensitive refinements of values, which are
all idiomatic in dynamic languages. It makes effective use of an off-the-shelf
solver to decide problems without heavy encodings. The approach is competitive
with a wide range of existing tools---including type systems, flow analyzers,
and model checkers---on their own benchmarks. We have built a tool which
analyzes programs written in Racket, and report on its effectiveness in
verifying and refuting contracts.

identify it as an extreme gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) source. PKS B0008-421
is characterized by the steepest known spectral slope below the turnover, close
to the theoretical limit of synchrotron self-absorption, and the smallest known
spectral width of any GPS source. Spectral coverage of the source spans from
0.118 to 22 GHz, which includes data from the Murchison Widefield Array and the
wide bandpass receivers on the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We have
implemented a Bayesian inference model fitting routine to fit the data with
various absorption models. We find that without the inclusion of a
high-frequency exponential break the absorption models can not accurately fit
the data, with significant deviations above and below the peak in the radio
spectrum. The addition of a high-frequency break provides acceptable spectral
fits for the inhomogeneous free-free absorption and double-component
synchrotron self-absorption models, with the inhomogeneous free-free absorption
model statistically favored. The requirement of a high-frequency spectral break
implies that the source has ceased injecting fresh particles. Additional
support for the inhomogeneous free-free absorption model as being responsible
for the turnover in the spectrum is given by the consistency between the
physical parameters derived from the model fit and the implications of the
exponential spectral break, such as the necessity of the source being
surrounded by a dense ambient medium to maintain the peak frequency near the
gigahertz region. The discovery of PKS B0008-421 suggests that the next
generation of low radio frequency surveys could reveal a large population of
GPS sources that have ceased activity, and that a portion of the ultra-steep
spectrum source population could be composed of these GPS sources in a relic
phase.

world-volume theory of revolving D-branes around a fixed point of orbifolds. In
this paper, we consider a simple model of the T6/Z3 orbifold on which we put
D3-branes, D7-branes and their anti-branes. The configuration breaks
supersymmetry, but the R-R tadpole cancellation conditions are satisfied. A set
of three D3-branes at an orbifold fixed point can separate from the point, but
when they move perpendicular to the anti-D7-branes put on the fixed point, they
are forced to be pulled back due to an attractive interaction between the D3
and anti-D7 branes. In order to stabilize the separation of the D3-branes at
nonzero distance, we consider revolution of the D3-branes around the fixed
point. Then the gauge symmetry on D3-branes is spontaneously broken, and the
rank of the gauge group is reduced. The distance can be set at our will by
appropriately choosing the angular momentum of the revolving D3-branes, which
should be determined by the initial condition of the cosmological evolution of
D-brane configurations. The distance corresponds to the vacuum expectation
values of brane moduli fields in the world-volume theory and, if it is written
as M/Ms^2 in terms of the string scale Ms, the scale of gauge symmetry breaking

Snell law photon momentum conservation constrain when using space-gradient
phase discontinuity, optical metasurfaces enabled an entirely new class of
ultrathin optical devices. Here, we show that by eradicating the photon energy

into a more universal form not limited by Lorentz reciprocity, hence, meeting
all the requirements for building magnetic-free optical isolators. Furthermore,
photons experience inelastic interaction with time-gradient metasurfaces, which
modifies photonic energy eigenstates and results in a Doppler-like wavelength
shift. Consequently, metasurfaces with both space- and time-gradients can have
a strong impact on a plethora of photonic applications and provide versatile

in an interacting binary becomes asymptotically one of adiabatic expansion. We
survey here adiabatic mass loss from Population I stars of mass 0.10 Msun to
100 Msun from the zero age main sequence to the base of the giant branch, or to
central hydrogen exhaustion for lower main sequence stars. For intermediate-
and high-mass stars, dynamical mass transfer is preceded by an extended phase
of thermal time scale mass transfer as the star is stripped of most of its
envelope mass. The critical mass ratio qad above which this delayed dynamical
instability occurs increases with advancing evolutionary age of the donor star,
by ever-increasing factors for more massive donors. Most intermediate- or
high-mass binaries with nondegenerate accretors probably evolve into contact
before manifesting this instability. As they approach the base of the giant
branch, however, and begin developing a convective envelope, qad plummets
dramatically among intermediate-mass stars, to values of order unity, and a
prompt dynamical instability occurs. Among low-mass stars, the prompt
instability prevails throughout main sequence evolution, with q_ad declining
with decreasing mass. Our calculated qad agree well with the behavior of
timedependent models by Chen & Han (2003) of intermediate-mass stars initiating
mass transfer in the Hertzsprung gap. Application of our results to cataclysmic
variables, as systems which must be stable against rapid mass transfer, nicely
circumscribes the range in qad as a function of orbital period in which they
are found. These results are intended to advance the verisimilitude of
population synthesis models of close binary evolution.

using a novel and simple method to extract an optimal state that can saturate
the tradeoff relation between quantum nonlocality and the state purity. In this
paradox, the logical inequality which is formulated by the GHZ-typed event
probabilities can be violated maximally by the optimal state for any fixed
amount of purity (or mixedness). Moreover, the optimal state can be described
as a standard GHZ state suffering flipped color noise. The maximal amount of

step toward deeper understanding of the role played by the AVN proof of quantum

rate in the United States. For over a century of observations on the real GDP
per capita of the United States a sustainable two percent growth rate has been
observed. To find an explanation for this observation I consider the impact of
utility preferences and the effect of mobility of labor \& capital on every
provided measurement. Mobility of labor results in heterogenous rates of
increase in prices which is called Baumol's cost disease phenomenon.
Heterogeneous rates of inflation then make it impossible to define an invariant
measure for the real growth rate. Paradoxical and ambiguous results already
have been observed when different measurements provided by the World Bank have
been compared with the ones from the systems of national accounts (SNA). Such
ambiguity is currently being discussed in economy. I define a toy model for
caring out measurements in order to state that this ambiguity can be very
significant. I provide examples in which GDP expands 5 folds while measurements
percept an expansion around 2 folds. Violation of invariance of the
measurements leads to state that it is hard to compare the growth rate of GDP
for a smooth growing country such as the U.S. with a fast growing country such
as China. Besides, I state that to extrapolate the time that economy of China
passes the economy of the US we need to consider local metric of the central
banks of both countries. Finally I conclude that it is our method of
measurements that leads us to percept the sustainable growth rate.

single oscillator model, in which the spatial dispersion effects are
represented by an additional term depending on the square of the total
wavevector k. The theory takes into account the scattering of the
electromagneticexcitation at the surface of the dielectric material, which
leads to the need of additional boundary conditions in order to solve Maxwell's

boundary conditions appear as additional surface scattering parameters in the
expressions of the surface impedances. It is shown that the nonlocal modeling

Assuming that $f$ is $CM$, give conditions on the $f(p)$, either necessary or
sufficient, both is possible, for $f$ being $CMO$ : that is the general purpose
of the authors.The $CMO$ character of $f$ is invariant under slight

in a more general context (theorem 4).After general statements of that sort,
including examples of $CMO$ (theorem 5), the paper is devoted to ""small""

state information at the base stations (BSs) requires uplink pilot signaling.
Since the number of orthogonal pilot sequences is limited by the channel
coherence, pilot reuse across cells is necessary to achieve high spectral
efficiency. However, finding efficient pilot reuse patterns is non-trivial
especially in practical asymmetric BS deployments. We approach this problem
using coalitional game theory. Each BS has a few unique pilots and can form
coalitions with other BSs to gain access to more pilots. The BSs in a coalition
thus benefit from serving more users in their cells, at the expense of higher
pilot contamination and interference. Given that a cell's average spectral
efficiency depends on the overall pilot reuse pattern, the suitable coalitional
game model is in partition form. We develop a low-complexity distributed
coalition formation based on individual stability. By incorporating a base
station intercommunication budget constraint, we are able to control the
overhead in message exchange between the base stations and ensure the
algorithm's convergence to a solution of the game called individually stable
coalition structure. Simulation results reveal fast algorithmic convergence and
substantial performance gains over the baseline schemes with no pilot reuse,
full pilot reuse, or random pilot reuse pattern.

periodic orbits of continuous unimodal maps on the interval $[0, 1]$ of least
periods $\ge 2$ are nested in the sense that if $P$ and $Q$ are periodic orbits
of a continuous unimodal map on $[0, 1]$ of least periods $\ge 2$ and if $\max

values of total energies. Here, for example, we are interested in the cross
sections for total energy 11 cm$^{-1}$. The calculations have been done for the

problem that has applications to molecular folding and production management.
We are given a bipartite graph $H=(B,S)$. Vertices in $B$ are thought of as
goods or services that must be \emph{bought} to produce items in $S$ that are
to be \emph{sold}. An edge from $j\in S$ to $i\in B$ indicates that the
production of $j$ requires the purchase of $i$. Each vertex in $B$ has a cost,
and each vertex in $S$ results in some gain. The goal is to obtain an ordering
of $B\cup S$ that respects the precedence constraints and maximizes the minimal
net profit encountered as the vertices are processed. We call this optimal
value the \emph{budget} or \emph{capital} investment required for the bipartite
graph, and refer to our problem as \emph{the bipartite graph ordering problem}.
  The problem is equivalent to a version of an NP-complete molecular folding
problem that has been studied recently [12]. Work on the molecular folding
problem has focused on heuristic algorithms and exponential-time exact
algorithms for the un-weighted problem where costs are $\pm 1$ and when
restricted to graphs arising from RNA folding.
  The bipartite graph present work seeks exact algorithms for solving the
bipartite ordering problem. We demonstrate an algorithm that computes the
optimal ordering in time $O^*(2^n)$ when $n$ is the number of vertices in the
input bipartite graph. Our main result is a general strategy that can be used
to find an optimal ordering in polynomial time for bipartite graphs that
satisfy certain properties. We apply the technique to a variety of graph
classes, obtaining polynomial-time solutions to the bipartite graph ordering
problem for bipartite permutation graphs, trivially perfect, co-bipartite
graphs, and trees.

associations, including the known concentrations of Arp's Loop, Holmberg\,IX,
an arc in the halo of M82, BK3N, and the Garland. Many of these groupings do
not have counterparts in the RGB maps, suggesting they may be genuinely young

as faint tidal streams that link these systems. The halos of M82 and NGC\,3077

Remarkably, our deep panoramic view of the M81 group demonstrates that the

regimes of complex fluid flows into a consistent microscopic picture of

lead to strong spatial organization of the flow field, below jamming, the
slowly diminishing elastic correlation length leads to slowly ceasing spatial
organization, which is nevertheless still present down to densities far below
jamming. We show that the long-range correlated flow field arises from the
superposition of quadrupolar strain fields of shear zones with highly
correlated positions, strengths and orientation. These interactions are still
pertinent below jamming, where they systematically weaken with the slowly
diminishing elastic correlation length. These results demonstrate the ubiquity

carbyne as compared to other novel carbon allotropes such as fullerenes,
nanotubes and graphene. Although end-capping groups can be used to stabilize
carbon chains, length limitation is still a barrier for its actual production,
and even more for applications. Here, we report a novel route for bulk
production of record long acetylenic linear carbon chains protected by thin
double-walled carbon nanotubes. A corresponding extremely high Raman band is
the first proof of a truly bulk yield formation of very long arrangements,
which is unambiguously confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and
near-field Raman spectroscopy. Our production establishes a way to
exceptionally long stable carbon chains including more than 2300 carbon atoms,
and an elegant forerunner towards the final goal of a bulk production of
essentially infinite carbyne.

following solution-liquid-solid synthesis of quantum nanowires directly on

simple preparation process leads to a photodetector device with a film of
nanowires of limited thickness bridging the electrode gaps, in which a high
fraction of individual nanowires are electrically contacted and can be exposed
to light at the same time. The high sensitivity of the photodetector device can
be expressed by its on/off-ratio or its photosensitivity of more than 107 over
a broad wavelength range up to about 700 nm. The specific detectivity and
responsivity are determined to D* = 4*10^13 Jones and R = 0.32 A/W,
respectively. The speed of the device reflects itself in a 3 dB frequency above
1 MHz corresponding to rise and fall times below 350 ns. The remarkable
combination of a high sensitivity and a fast response is attributed to
depletion regions inside the nanowires, tunnel-junction barriers between
nanowires, as well as Schottky contacts at the electrodes, where all these
features are strongly influenced by the number of photo generated charge

'90s, we are the first to show that it preserves decomposability and
boundedness of treewidth of the constraint matrix. This implies that our
extension of $P_\varphi(G)$ is decomposable and has a constraint matrix of

explicitly into account the periodicity of the interaction potential. The
integration of the $c$-function along trajectories of the non-perturbative
renormalization group flow gives access to the central charges of the model in
the fixed points. The results at vanishing frequency $\beta^2$, where the
periodicity does not play a role, are retrieved and the independence on the
cutoff regulator for small frequencies is discussed. Our findings show that the
central charge obtained integrating the trajectories starting from the
repulsive low-frequencies fixed points ($\beta^2 <8\pi$) to the infrared limit
is in good quantitative agreement with the expected $\Delta c=1$ result. The
behavior of the $c$-function in the other parts of the flow diagram is also
discussed. Finally, we point out that also including higher harmonics in the
renormalization group treatment at the level of local potential approximation
is not sufficient to give reasonable results, even if the periodicity is taken
into account. Rather, incorporating the wave-function renormalization (i. e.
going beyond local potential approximation) is crucial to get sensible results
even when a single frequency is used.

considered. Determining a general achievable rate for the channel and obtaining
the capacity in a non-limiting case, we try to analyze and solve the Gaussian
version of the Cover-Chiang theorem -as an open problem- mathematically and
information-theoretically. Our capacity theorem, while including all previous
theorems as its special cases, explains situations that can not be analyzed by
them; for example, the effect of the correlation between the side information
and the channel input on the capacity of the channel that can not be analyzed
with Costa's ""writing on dirty paper"" theorem. Meanwhile, we try to introduce
our new idea, i.e., describing the concept of ""cognition"" of a communicating
object (transmitter, receiver, relay and so on) on some variable (channel
noise, interference and so on) with the information-theoretic concept of ""side
information"" correlated to that variable and known by the object. According to
our theorem, the channel capacity is an increasing function of the mutual
information of the side information and the channel noise. Therefore our
channel and its capacity theorem exemplify the ""cognition"" of the transmitter
and receiver on the channel noise based on the new description. Our capacity
theorem has interesting interpretations originated from this new idea.

transitions between phases with vanishing and large single-particle diffusion.
In the phases with vanishing single-particle diffusion, the system evolves
towards regular lattices, usually on very slow time scales. Different lattices
can be approached, depending on interaction strength and forcing amplitude. The
disordered state appears in parameter regions where the regular lattices are
unstable. Correlation functions between the particles reveal the formation of
shear bands. In contrast to single particle densities, the spatially resolved
two-particle correlation functions vary with time and allow to determine the

strong diffusion it is not.

strongly on dealing with non-detection events due to losses and detector
inefficiencies. Otherwise, the so-called detection loophole could be exploited.
The only way to avoid this is to have detection efficiencies that are above a
certain threshold. We introduce the intermediate assumption of limited
detection efficiency, e.g. in each run of the experiment the overall detection
efficiency is lower bounded by $\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, in an adversarial
scenario, the adversaries have arbitrary large but not full control over the
inefficiencies. We analyze the set of possible correlations that fulfil Limited
Detection Locality (LDL) and show that they necessarily satisfy some linear
Bell-like inequalities. We prove that quantum theory predicts violation of one
of these inequalities for all $\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, nonlocality can be
demonstrated with arbitrarily small limited detection efficiencies. Finally we
propose a generalized scheme that uses this characterization to deal with
detection inefficiencies, which interpolates between the two usual schemes,
postselection and outcome assignment.

chain current vanishes is independent of the chain length and coupling
strength. Far from the stall force the mobility of the chain is strongly

produce the necessary thrust force for locomotion at low Reynolds number and
the ""reactive"" swimmers, lying in the high Reynolds range, and using added mass
acceleration (described by perfect fluid theory). However, inertial swimmers
are also systems that dissipate energy, due to their finite size, therefore
involving strong resistive contributions, even for high Reynolds numbers. Using
a complete model for the hydrodynamic forces, involving both reactive and

the inhomogeneities grow, though slower than in non-magnetised universes.
Wavelengths smaller than the magnetic Jeans length typically oscillate with

Building blocks that show promise for assembling new complex materials can be

direct connection between building block attributes and bulk behavior is both
necessary for rationally engineering materials, and difficult because building
block attributes can be altered in many ways. Here we show how to exploit the

results give concrete solutions to the more general conceptual challenge of
optimizing emergent behaviors in nature, and can be applied to other types of

typically created with an exponential evaporation ramp that is approximately
optimal for s-wave, ergodic dynamics with two-body interactions and no other
loss rates, but likely sub-optimal for many real experiments. Machine learning
using a Gaussian process, in contrast, develops a statistical model of the
relationship between the parameters it controls and the quality of the BEC
produced. This is an online process, and an active one, as the Gaussian process
model updates on the basis of each subsequent experiment and proposes a new set
of parameters as a result. We demonstrate that the Gaussian process machine
learner is able to discover a ramp that produces high quality BECs in 10 times
fewer iterations than a previously used online optimization technique.

which parameters are essential in BEC creation and which are unimportant,

widths (i.e., ""HBT radii"") of homogeneity regions in the fireballs produced in
heavy ion collisions. Because the initial conditions of these collisions are
stochastically fluctuating, the measured HBT radii also exhibit variation on an
event-by-event basis. However, HBT measurements have, to date, been performed
only on an ensemble-averaged basis, due to inherent limitations of finite
particle statistics. In this paper, we show that experimental measurements to
date are best characterized theoretically as weighted averages of the
event-by-event HBT radii, and we propose a new method for extracting
experimentally both the arithmetic mean and the variance of the event-by-event
distribution of HBT radii. We demonstrate the extraction of the mean and
variance of this distribution for a particular ensemble of numerically
generated events, and offer some ideas to extend and generalize the method to
enable measurement of higher moments of the HBT distribution as well.

fraction of CEMP stars. Most CEMP stars are enriched in $s$-elements (CEMP-$s$
stars), and some of these are also enriched in $r$-elements (CEMP-$s/r$ stars).
One formation scenario proposed for CEMP stars invokes wind mass transfer in
the past from a TP-AGB primary star to a less massive companion star which is
presently observed. We generate low-metallicity populations of binary stars to
reproduce the observed CEMP-star fraction. In addition, we aim to constrain our
wind mass-transfer model and investigate under which conditions our synthetic
populations reproduce observed abundance distributions. We compare the CEMP
fractions and the abundance distributions determined from our synthetic
populations with observations. Several physical parameters of the binary
stellar population of the halo are uncertain, e.g. the initial mass function,
the mass-ratio and orbital-period distributions, and the binary fraction. We
vary the assumptions in our model about these parameters, as well as the wind
mass-transfer process, and study the consequent variations of our synthetic
CEMP population. The CEMP fractions calculated in our synthetic populations
vary between 7% and 17%, a range consistent with the CEMP fractions among very
metal-poor stars recently derived from the SDSS/SEGUE data sample. The results
of our comparison between the modelled and observed abundance distributions are
different for CEMP-$s/r$ stars and for CEMP-$s$ stars. For the latter, our
simulations qualitatively reproduce the observed distributions of C, Na, Sr,
Ba, Eu, and Pb. Contrarily, for CEMP-$s/r$ stars our model cannot reproduce the
large abundances of neutron-rich elements such as Ba, Eu, and Pb. This result
is consistent with previous studies, and suggests that CEMP-$s/r$ stars
experienced a different nucleosynthesis history to CEMP-$s$ stars.

we relate the emission line width variability to the presence of a wind cavity

involving a spectator dilaton field. In our setup, the rolling spectator
dilaton causes a tachyonic instability of gauge fields, leading to a copious
production of gauge fields in the superhorizon regime, which generates
additional scalar and tensor perturbations through gravitational interactions.
Our prime concern is the possibility to enhance the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$
relative to the standard result, while satisfying the observational
constraints. To this end, we allow the dilaton field to be stabilized before
the end of inflation, but after the CMB scales exit the horizon. We show that
for the inflaton slow roll parameter $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-3}$, the
tensor-to-scalar ratio in our setup can be enhanced only by a factor of ${\cal
O}(1)$ compared to the standard result. On the other hand, for smaller
$\epsilon$ corresponding to a lower inflation energy scale, a much bigger
enhancement can be achieved, so that our setup can give rise to an observably
large $r\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ even when $\epsilon\ll 10^{-3}$. The tensor
perturbation sourced by the spectator dilaton can have a strong scale
dependence, and is generically red-tilted. We also discuss a specific model to
realize our scenario, and identify the parameter region giving an observably
large $r$ for relatively low inflation energy scales.

asymptotically optimal with respect to symbol error rate (SER) with an
increasing number of antennas, for any finite signal to noise ratio (SNR) at
the receiver, under different assumptions on the availability of CSI statistics
(exact channel fading distribution or the first few moments of the channel
fading distribution). We also consider the case of imperfect knowledge of the
channel statistics and describe in detail the case when there is a bounded
uncertainty on the moments of the fading distribution. We present numerical
results on the SER performance achieved by these designs in typical scenarios
and find that they may outperform existing noncoherent constellations, e.g.,
conventional Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), and pilot-based schemes, e.g., Pulse
Amplitude Modulation (PAM). We also observe that an optimized constellation for
a specific channel distribution makes it very sensitive to uncertainties in the
channel statistics. In particular, constellation designs based on optimistic
channel conditions could lead to significant performance degradation in terms

complicated. In the second part of this paper we use a simplified method to
obtain uniform asymptotic expansions for these functions. The coefficients are
just polynomials and satisfy simple recurrence relations. The price to pay is
that these asymptotic expansions hold only in a shrinking interval as their
respective parameters become large; this interval however encapsulates all the
interesting oscillatory behaviour of the functions. This simplified method also
gives many terms in asymptotic expansions for these eigenvalues, derived

the beacon to transmit and receive the signals which is called as Received

develop a complete qualitative stochastic homogenization theory for nonconvex
unbounded functionals with convex growth. We first prove that if the integrand
is convex and has $p$-growth from below (with $p>d$, the dimension), then it
admits homogenization regardless of growth conditions from above. This result,
that crucially relies on the existence and sublinearity at infinity of
correctors, is also new in the periodic case. In the case of nonconvex

nonconvex integrand admits a two-sided estimate by a convex integrand (the
domain of which may depend on the space-variable) that itself admits
homogenization. This result is of interest to the rigorous derivation of rubber

Power systems rely on a network of power lines and transformers to deliver
power from sources of power (generators) to the consumers (loads). However,
when power lines fail (for example, through lightning or natural disasters) or
when the system is heavily used, the network is often unable to fulfill all of
the demand for power. While systems are vulnerable to these failures,
increasingly, sophisticated control devices are being deployed to improve the
efficiency of power systems. Such devices can also be used to improve the
resiliency of power systems to failures. In this paper, we focus on using FACTS

the impedance parameters of power lines, thereby redistributing flow in the
network and potentially increasing the amount of power that is supplied. Here

Grav. 48, 55 (2016)","10.1007/s10714-016-2053-2",,"gr-qc hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is generally believed that any quantum theory of gravity should have a
generic feature --- a quantum of length. We provide a physical ansatz to obtain
an effective non-local metric tensor starting from the standard metric tensor
such that the spacetime acquires a zero-point-length $\ell _{0}$ of the order
of the Planck length $L_{P}$. This prescription leads to several remarkable
consequences. In particular, the Euclidean volume $V_D(\ell,\ell_{0})$ in a
$D$-dimensional spacetime of a region of size $\ell $ scales as $V_D(\ell, \ell
_{0}) \propto \ell_{0}^{D-2} \ell^2$ when $\ell \sim \ell_{0}$, while it
reduces to the standard result $V_D(\ell,\ell_{0}) \propto \ell^D$ at large
scales ($\ell \gg \ell_{0}$). The appropriately defined effective dimension,
$D_{\rm eff} $, decreases continuously from $D_{\rm eff}=D$ (at $\ell \gg
\ell_{0}$) to $D_{\rm eff}=2$ (at $\ell \sim \ell_{0}$). This suggests that the
physical spacetime becomes essentially 2-dimensional near Planck scale.

  Methods","11 pages,5 figures",,,,"math.OC cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is concerned with the popular Sudoku problem. We proposed a warm
restart strategy for solving Sudoku puzzles, based on the sparse optimization
technique. Furthermore, we defined a new difficulty level for Sudoku puzzles.
The efficiency of the proposed method is tested using a dataset of Sudoku
puzzles, and the numerical results show that the accurate recovery rate can be
enhanced from 84%+ to 99%+ using the L1 sparse optimization method.

Mars is almost similar to the Earth. For the optimized values of free

obtained by Schulze-Makuch {\it et al.} (2011). We have found that the
exoplanet 55 Cnc f is within 10% away from the threshold value T. The

Therefore the existence of periodic trajectories in a certain polygon becomes

several fields of applied mathematics, for instances, detection of chirps, or
image processing. In this work we present a non-trivial generalization of Gabor
frames to the quaternionic case and give new density results. The key tool is
the two-sided windowed quaternionic Fourier transform (WQFT). As in the complex
case, we want to write the WQFT as an inner product between a quaternion-valued
signal and shifts and modulates of a real-valued window function. We
demonstrate a Heisenberg uncertainty principle and for the results regarding
the density, we employ the quaternionic Zak transform to obtain necessary and
sufficient conditions to ensure that a quaternionic Gabor system is a
quaternionic Gabor frame. We conclude with a proof that the Gabor conjecture do
not hold true in the quaternionic case.
