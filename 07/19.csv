coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using data from the STEREO spacecraft. We seek to
quantify the extent to which momentum coupling between these CMEs and the
ambient solar wind (i.e., the aerodynamic drag) influences their dynamics. To
this end, we use results from a 3D flux rope model fit to the CME data. We find
that solar wind aerodynamic drag adequately accounts for the dynamics of the
fastest CME in our sample. For the relatively slower CMEs, we find that
drag-based models initiated below heliocentric distances ranging from 15 to 50
$R_{\odot}$ cannot account for the observed CME trajectories. This is at
variance with the general perception that the dynamics of slow CMEs are
influenced primarily by solar wind drag from a few $R_{\odot}$ onwards. Several
slow CMEs propagate at roughly constant speeds above 15--50 $R_{\odot}$.
Drag-based models initiated above these heights therefore require negligible
aerodynamic drag to explain their observed trajectories.

We show that the power-law properties and the scaling of return intervals and

general class of non-linear stochastic differential equations derived from a
master equation of an agent system that is coupled by herding interactions.
Specifically, we find that this approach enables us to recover the volatility

densities for the NYSE and FOREX markets, for different assets, and for
different time-scales. We find also that the historical S\&P500 monthly series

is expected to be two-thirds by 2050. Fostered by the relevancy of a scientific
characterization of cities and for the availability of an unprecedented amount
of data, academics have recently immersed in this topic and one of the most
striking and universal finding was the discovery of robust allometric scaling
laws between several urban indicators and the population size. Despite that,
most governmental reports and several academic works still ignore these
nonlinearities by often analyzing the raw or the per capita value of urban
indicators, a practice that actually makes the urban metrics biased towards
small or large cities depending on whether we have super or sublinear
allometries. By following the ideas of Bettencourt et al., we account for this
bias by evaluating the difference between the actual value of an urban
indicator and the value expected by the allometry with the population size. We
show that this scale-adjusted metric provides a more appropriate/informative
summary of the evolution of urban indicators and reveals patterns that do not
appear in the evolution of per capita values of indicators obtained from
Brazilian cities. We also show that these scale-adjusted metrics are strongly
correlated with their past values by a linear correspondence and that they also
display crosscorrelations among themselves. Simple linear models account for
31%-97% of the observed variance in data and correctly reproduce the average of
the scale-adjusted metric when grouping the cities in above and below the
allometric laws. We further employ these models to forecast future values of
urban indicators and, by visualizing the predicted changes, we verify the
emergence of spatial clusters characterized by regions of the Brazilian
territory where we expect an increase or a decrease in the values of urban
indicators.

categories $\mathsf{Cat}$ with the property that maps from $\mathbb{C}$ into
them are in one to one correspondence with strict monoidal, monoidal, and skew
monoidal categories. In this last case, the classification result can be
understood as justifying the definition of skew monoidal categories
intrinsically in terms of the structure of $\mathbb{C}$.
  In this paper, we consider a single nerve -- the homotopy coherent nerve of
$\mathsf{Cat}$ viewed as a one object simplicially enriched category -- and
verify that maps from $\mathbb{C}$ to it classify the three monoidal-type
categories mentioned above, as well as lax monoidal categories and
$\Sigma$-monoidal categories. Furthermore, we identify a new monoidal-type
category corresponding to the most general such maps and present them in the
usual way: a collection of data subject to explicit coherence requirements.
These results suggest that the space of maps from $\mathbb{C}$ to the coherent

question is how the topology of a network affects the susceptibility of a
routing protocol to endogenous route misdirection. In this paper we define and
analyze an abstract model of traffic interception (i.e. eavesdropping) in
distance-vector routing networks. Specifically, we study al- gorithms that
measure the potential of groups of dishonest agents to divert traffic through
their infrastructure under the constraint that messages must reach their

kinds of lies, define strategies for colluding agents, and prove optimality in
special cases. In our main theorem we derive a provably optimal monitoring
strategy for subsets of agents in which no two are adjacent, and we extend this
strategy to the general case. Finally, we use our results to analyze the
susceptibility of real and synthetic networks to endogenous traffic

structure, which influences both the accretion and migration rates of embedded
planets. The disc itself evolves on time-scales of several Myr during which
both temperature and density profiles change as matter accretes onto the
central star. Here we use a detailed model of an evolving disc to determine the
growth of planets by pebble accretion and their migration through the disc.
Cores that reach their pebble isolation mass accrete gas to finally form giant
planets with extensive gas envelopes, while planets that do not reach pebble
isolation mass are stranded as ice giants and ice planets containing only minor
amounts of gas in their envelopes. Unlike earlier population synthesis models,
our model works without any artificial reductions in migration speed and for
protoplanetary discs with gas and dust column densities similar to those
inferred from observations. We find that in our nominal disc model the
emergence of planetary embryos preferably occurs after approximately 2 Myr in
order to not exclusively form gas giants, but also ice giants and smaller
planets. The high pebble accretion rates ensure that critical core masses for
gas accretion can be reached at all orbital distances. Gas giant planets
nevertheless experience significant reduction in semi-major axes by migration.
Considering instead planetesimal accretion for planetary growth, we show that
formation time-scales are too long to compete with the migration time-scales
and the dissipation time of the protoplanetary disc. Altogether, we find that
pebble accretion overcomes many of the challenges in the formation of ice and
gas giants in evolving protoplanetary discs.

We present the results of our investigation of reversing the velocity axis to

overly compacted and enhance washed out emission details in the standard
Doppler framework. The inside-out tomogram is constructed independently of the
standard tomogram by directly projecting phase-resolved spectra onto an
inside-out velocity coordinate frame. For the inside-out framework, the
zero-velocity origin is transposed to the outer circumference and the maximum
velocities to the origin of the velocity space. We test the technique on a
simulated system and two real systems with easily identifiable features, namely
the accretion disc and bright spot in WZ Sge, and spiral shocks in IP Peg. Our
tests show that there is a redistribution of the relative brightness of
emission components throughout the tomograms, i.e., where the standard
framework tends to concentrate and enhance lower velocity features towards the
origin, the inside-out velocity framework tends to concentrate and enhance
higher velocity features towards the origin. Conversely, the standard framework
disperses and smears the higher velocities farther away from the origin whereas
the inside-out framework disperses and smears the lower velocities. In
addition, the projection of the accretion disc in velocity space now appears
correctly orientated with the inner edge close to the maximum velocity origin
and its outer edge closer to the zero-velocity outer circumference.
Furthermore, the gas stream and secondary star are projected on the outside of
the disc with the bright spot of the stream-disc impact region on the disc's
outer edge in the inside-out velocity space.

shear flow is investigated via an accelerated boundary integral implementation.
The neo-Hookean model is used as the constitutive law of the capsule membrane.
The maximum wall-normal migration is observed when the oscillation period of
the imposed shear is of the order of the relaxation time of the elastic
membrane; hence, the optimal capillary number scales with the inverse of the
oscillation frequency and the ratio agrees well with the theoretical prediction
in the limit of high-frequency oscillation. The migration velocity decreases
monotonically with the frequency of the applied shear and the capsule-wall
distance. We report a significant correlation between the capsule lateral
migration and the normal stress difference induced in the flow. The periodic
variation of the capsule deformation is roughly in phase with that of the
migration velocity and normal stress difference, with twice the frequency of
the imposed shear. The maximum deformation increases linearly with the membrane
elasticity before reaching a plateau at higher capillary numbers when the
deformation is limited by the time over which shear is applied in the same
direction and not by the membrane deformability. The maximum membrane
deformation scales as the distance to the wall to the power 1/3 as observed for
capsules and droplets in near-wall steady shear flows.

potential sides of the controversy; and (iii) measuring the amount of
controversy from characteristics of the graph.

find that our new random-walk-based measure outperforms existing ones in
capturing the intuitive notion of controversy, and show that content features

variant, where one wants to recover a clique of size $\omega \gg \log{(n)}$
added to an \Erdos-\Renyi graph $G \sim G(n,\frac{1}{2})$, have been intensely
studied. Nevertheless, existing polynomial time algorithms can only recover
planted cliques of size $\omega = \Omega(\sqrt{n})$. By contrast, information
theoretically, one can recover planted cliques so long as $\omega \gg
\log{(n)}$. In this work, we continue the investigation of algorithms from the
sum of squares hierarchy for solving the planted clique problem begun by Meka,
Potechin, and Wigderson (MPW, 2015) and Deshpande and Montanari (DM,2015). Our
main results improve upon both these previous works by showing:
  1. Degree four SoS does not recover the planted clique unless $\omega \gg
\sqrt n poly \log n$, improving upon the bound $\omega \gg n^{1/3}$ due to DM.
A similar result was obtained independently by Raghavendra and Schramm (2015).
  2. For $2 < d = o(\sqrt{\log{(n)}})$, degree $2d$ SoS does not recover the
planted clique unless $\omega \gg n^{1/(d + 1)} /(2^d poly \log n)$, improving
upon the bound due to MPW.
  Our proof for the second result is based on a fine spectral analysis of the
certificate used in the prior works MPW,DM and Feige and Krauthgamer (2003) by
decomposing it along an appropriately chosen basis. Along the way, we develop
combinatorial tools to analyze the spectrum of random matrices with dependent
entries and to understand the symmetries in the eigenspaces of the set
symmetric matrices inspired by work of Grigoriev (2001).
  An argument of Kelner shows that the first result cannot be proved using the
same certificate. Rather, our proof involves constructing and analyzing a new
certificate that yields the nearly tight lower bound by ""correcting"" the
certificate of previous works.

electrons, whether these electrons are free or bound. The electronic
oscillations in turn give rise to electromagnetic radiation which, in the case
of linear media, possess the frequency of the exciting beam. Because Maxwell's
equations are linear, one expects the total field at any point in space to be
the sum of the original (exciting) field and the radiation produced by all the
oscillating electrons. However, in practice the original beam appears to be
absent within the medium, as though it had been replaced by a different beam,
one having a shorter wavelength and propagating in a different direction. The
Ewald-Oseen theorem resolves this paradox by showing how the oscillating
electrons conspire to produce a field that exactly cancels out the original
beam everywhere inside the medium. The net field is indeed the sum of the
incident beam and the radiated field of the oscillating electrons, but the
latter field completely masks the former. Although the proof of the Ewald-Oseen
theorem is fairly straightforward, it involves complicated integrations over
dipolar fields in three-dimensional space, making it a brute-force drill in
calculus and devoid of physical insight. It is possible, however, to prove the
theorem using plane-waves interacting with thin slabs of material, while
invoking no physics beyond Fresnel's reflection coefficients. The thin slabs
represent sheets of electric dipoles, and the use of Fresnel's coefficients
allows one to derive exact expressions for the electromagnetic field radiated
by these dipolar sheets. The goal of the present article is to outline a proof
of the Ewald-Oseen theorem using arguments that are based primarily on
thin-film optics.

corresponds to device area of only about 0.014{\lambda}^2, where {\lambda} is
the vacuum wavelength. And the center wavelength of the device can be tuned in
a broad band from 7{\mu}m to 9{\mu}m with the Fermi level of graphene varied
from 0.5eV to 1eV. Furthermore, the device is easy to be fabricated on chip.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of efficiently broadcasting packets in multi-hop
wireless networks. At each time slot the network controller activates a set of
non-interfering links and forwards selected copies of packets on each activated
link. A packet is considered jointly received only when all nodes in the
network have obtained a copy of it. The maximum rate of jointly received
packets is referred to as the broadcast capacity of the network. Existing
policies achieve the broadcast capacity by balancing traffic over a set of
spanning trees, which are difficult to maintain in a large and time-varying
wireless network. We propose a new dynamic algorithm that achieves the
broadcast capacity when the underlying network topology is a directed acyclic
graph (DAG). This algorithm is decentralized, utilizes local queue-length
information only and does not require the use of global topological structures
such as spanning trees. The principal technical challenge inherent in the
problem is the absence of work-conservation principle due to the duplication of
packets, which renders traditional queuing modelling inapplicable. We overcome
this difficulty by studying relative packet deficits and imposing in-order
delivery constraints to every node in the network. Although in-order packet
delivery, in general, leads to degraded throughput in graphs with cycles, we
show that it is throughput optimal in DAGs and can be exploited to simplify the
design and analysis of optimal algorithms. Our characterization leads to a
polynomial time algorithm for computing the broadcast capacity of any wireless
DAG under the primary interference constraints. Additionally, we propose an
extension of our algorithm which can be effectively used for broadcasting in
any network with arbitrary topology.

largely unexplored. Analyzing a general model of excitable systems with
heterogeneous excitability, we find that diversity can greatly enhance optimal

Heterogeneous systems possess a subset of specialized elements whose capability
greatly exceeds that of the nonspecialized elements. Nonetheless, the behavior

necessary to produce relevant upconversion luminescence. Achieving high UCQY
under practically relevant irradiance remains a major challenge. The UCQY is
severely limited due to non-radiative surface quenching processes. We present a
rate equation model for migration of the excitation energy to show that surface
quenching does not only affect the lanthanide ions directly at the surface but
also many other lanthanide ions quite far away from the surface. The average
migration path length is in the order of several nanometers and depends on the
doping as well as the irradiance of the excitation. Using Er3+-doped beta-NaYF4
UCNCs, we show that very isotropic and thick (~10 nm) beta-NaLuF4 inert shells
dramatically reduce the surface-related quenching processes, resulting in much
brighter upconversion luminescence at simultaneously considerably lower
irradiances. For these UCNCs embedded in PMMA, we determined an internal UCQY
of 2.0+-0.2 % using an irradiance of only 0.43+-0.03 W/cm2 at 1523 nm.
Normalized to the irradiance, this UCQY is 120x higher than the highest values
of comparable nanomaterials in the literature. Our findings demonstrate the
important role of isotropic and thick shells in achieving high UCQY at low
irradiances from UCNCs. Additionally, we measured the additional short-circuit
current due to upconversion in silicon solar cell devices as a proof concept
and to support our findings determined using optical measurements.

the sense that only one outcome occurs; (iii) quantum theory is universal and
the irreversibility of the measurement process is only ""for all practical
purposes"". These assumptions are analyzed within quantum theory and their
consistency is tested in Deutsch's version of the Wigner's friend gedanken
experiment, where the friend reveals to Wigner whether she observes a definite
outcome without revealing which outcome she observes. The view that holds the
coexistence of the ""facts of the world"" common both for Wigner and his friend

understanding that ""facts"" can only exist relative to the observer.

in a nonparametric instrumental variable model leads to estimators that may
suffer from a very slow, logarithmic rate of convergence. In this paper, we
show that restricting the problem to models with monotone regression functions
and monotone instruments significantly weakens the ill-posedness of the
problem. In stark contrast to the existing literature, the presence of a
monotone instrument implies boundedness of our measure of ill-posedness when
restricted to the space of monotone functions. Based on this result we derive a
novel non-asymptotic error bound for the constrained estimator that imposes
monotonicity of the regression function. For a given sample size, the bound is
independent of the degree of ill-posedness as long as the regression function
is not too steep. As an implication, the bound allows us to show that the
constrained estimator converges at a fast, polynomial rate, independently of
the degree of ill-posedness, in a large, but slowly shrinking neighborhood of
constant functions. Our simulation study demonstrates significant finite-sample
performance gains from imposing monotonicity even when the regression function
is rather far from being a constant. We apply the constrained estimator to the

by the Hubble slow-roll parameters $\epsilon_H$ and $\eta_H$. Then, the second
Hubble slow-roll parameter $\eta_H$, which measures the duration of the
inflationary era, becomes singular at the point where the Type IV singularity
is chosen to occur, while the Hubble slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_H$ is
regular there. Therefore, this infinite singularity indicates that the
occurrence of the finite-time singularity is responsible for the instability in
the scalar field model we study. This sort of instability has it's imprint on
the dynamical system that can be constructed from the cosmological equations,
with the dynamical system being unstable. In addition, the instability due to
the singularity mechanism we propose, is discussed in the context of other
inflationary scalar potentials. Finally, we discuss the implications of such a
singularity in the Hubble slow-roll parameters and we also critically discuss
qualitatively, what implications could this effect have on the graceful exit
problem of the exponential model.

Alfv\'en wave (AW) damping via phase mixing and to explore the observational
implications. Our magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and analytical
calculations show that, when a background flow is present, mathematical
expressions for the AW damping via phase mixing are modified by the following
substitution: $C_A^\prime(x) \to C_A^\prime(x)+V_0^\prime(x)$, where $C_A$ and
$V_0$ are AW phase and the flow speeds, and the prime denotes a derivative in
the direction across the background magnetic field. In uniform magnetic fields
and over-dense plasma structures, where $C_A$ is smaller than in the
surrounding plasma, the flow, which is confined to the structure and going in
the same direction as the AW, reduces the effect of phase-mixing, because on
the edges of the structure $C_A^\prime$ and $V_0^\prime$ have opposite signs.
Thus, the wave damps by means of slower phase-mixing compared to the case
without the flow. This is the result of the co-directional flow that reduces
the wave front stretching in the transverse direction. We apply our findings to
addressing the question why over-dense solar coronal open magnetic field
structures (OMFS) are cooler than the background plasma. Observations show that
the over-dense OMFS (e.g. solar coronal polar plumes) are cooler than
surrounding plasma and that, in these structures, Doppler line-broadening is
consistent with bulk plasma motions, such as AW. If over-dense solar coronal
OMFS are heated by AW damping via phase-mixing, we show that, co-directional
with AW, plasma flow in them reduces the phase-mixing induced-heating, thus
providing an explanation of why they appear cooler than the background.

real functions, analogous relations among the upper and lower $M$-convexity
properties of real functions are established. More precisely, having an
$n$-tuple $(M_1,\dots,M_n)$ of continuous two-variable means, the notion of the
descendant of these means (which is also an $n$-tuple $(N_1,\dots,N_n)$ of
two-variable means) is introduced. In particular, when all the means $M_i$ are
weighted arithmetic, then the components of their descendants are also weighted
arithmetic means. More general statements are obtained in terms of the
generalized quasi-arithmetic or Matkowski means. The main results then state
that if a function $f$ is $M_i$-convex for all $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$, then it is
also $N_i$-convex for all $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$. Several consequences are
discussed.

excesses above standard model expectations in the invariant mass region of 1.8
-2.0 TeV. Interpreting the diboson excess of events in a model independent
fashion suggests that the vector boson pair production searches are best
described by WZ or ZZ topologies, because states decaying into W^+W^- pairs are
strongly constrained by semileptonic searches. Under the assumption of a low
string scale, we show that both the diboson and dijet excesses can be steered
by an anomalous U(1) field with very small coupling to leptons. The Drell-Yan
bounds are then readily avoided because of the leptophobic nature of the
massive Z' gauge boson. The non-negligible decay into ZZ required to
accommodate the data is a characteristic footprint of intersecting D-brane
models, wherein the Landau-Yang theorem can be evaded by anomaly-induced
operators involving a longitudinal Z. The model presented herein can be viewed
purely field-theoretically, although it is particularly well motivated from
string theory. Should the excesses become statistically significant at the
LHC13, the associated Z\gamma{} topology would become a signature consistent
only with a stringy origin.

methodologies are compared both in terms of applicability requirements and
numerical complexity by analyzing their performance for the same classical
queueing models.
  The main findings are: i) When both methods are applicable SL based
algorithms outperform the lattice path counting algorithm (LPCA). ii) There are
important classes of problems (e.g., models with (level) non-homogenous rates
or with finite state spaces) for which the SL methodology is applicable and for
which the LPCA cannot be used. iii) Another main advantage of successive
lumping algorithms over LPCAs is that the former includes a method to compute
the steady state distribution using this rate matrix.

simulation to study the heat flux and temperature jump at the interface as to
gain insights of the Kapitza resistance at the atomic scale. In the weak
coupling regime, the heat current is proportional to the square of the coupling
strength for the harmonic model as well as anharmonic models. Interestingly,
there exists a negative temperature jump between the interfacial particles in
particular parameter regimes. A nonlinear response of the boundary temperature
jump to the externally applied temperature difference in the $\phi^{4}$ lattice
is observed. To understand the anomalous result, we then extend our studies to
a model in which the interface is represented by a relatively small segment
with gradually changing spring constants, and find that the negative
temperature jump still exist. Finally, we show that the local velocity
distribution at the interface is so close to the Gaussian distribution that the
existence/absence of local equilibrium state seems unable to determine by
numerics in this way.

$z\sim 10$. They are often proposed as complementary tools to type-Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) in tracing the Hubble diagram of the Universe. The distance
calibrations of GRBs usually make use one or some of the empirical luminosity
correlations, such as $\tau_{\rm lag}-L$, $V-L$, $E_p-L$, $E_p-E_{\gamma}$,
$\tau_{\rm RT}-L$ and $E_p-E_{\rm iso}$ relations. These calibrating methods
are based on the underling assumption that the empirical luminosity
correlations are universal over all redshift range. In this paper, we test the
possible redshift dependence of six luminosity correlations by dividing GRBs
into low-$z$ and high-$z$ classes according to their redshift smaller or larger
than 1.4. It is shown that the $E_p-E_{\gamma}$ relation for low-$z$ GRBs is
consistent with that for high-$z$ GRBs within $1\sigma$ uncertainty. The
intrinsic scatter of $V-L$ relation is too larger to make a convincing
conclusion. For the rest four correlations, however, low-$z$ GRBs differ from
high-$z$ GRBs at more than $3\sigma$ confidence level. As such, we calibrate
GRBs using the $E_p-E_{\gamma}$ relation in a model-independent way. The
constraint of high-$z$ GRBs on the $\Lambda$CDM model gives $\Omega_M=0.302\pm
0.142(1\sigma)$, well consistent with the Planck 2015 results.

shown to be symptoms of chirp d'Alembertian travelling wave solutions, relating
to traditional sinusoidal waves by a rotation of the spectral decomposition due
to the clock acceleration caused by the Doppler rates during the flybys. The
lags thus relate to special relativity, but yield distance proportional shifts
like those of cosmology at short range.

of a volatile solvent for an isolated multicomponent droplet in a quiescent
environment, based on quasi-steady-state approximation. Among multiple solvent
components, only one component is considered to be much more volatile than the
rest such that other components are assumed to be nonvolatile remaining
unchanged in the droplet during the process of (single-component) volatile
solvent evaporation or condensation. For evaporating droplet, the droplet size
often initially decreases following the familiar ""d^2 law"" at an accelerated
rate. But toward the end, the rate of droplet size change diminishes due to the
presence of nonvolatile cosolvent. Such an acceleration-deceleration reversal
behavior is unique for evaporating multicomponent droplet, while the droplet of
pure solvent has an accelerated rate of size change all the way through the
end. This reversal behavior is also reflected in the droplet surface
temperature evolution as ""S-shaped"" curves. However, a closer mathematical
examination of conditions for acceleration-deceleration reversal indicates that
the acceleration phase may disappear when the amount of nonvolatile cosolvent
is relatively small and ambient vapor pressure is relatively high. Because the
net effect of adding nonvolatile cosolvent is to reduce the mole fraction of
the volatile solvent such that the saturation vapor pressure is lowered, vapor
condensation onto the multicomponent droplet is predicted to occur when the
ambient vapor pressure is subsaturated with respect to that for the pure
volatile solvent. In this case, the droplet will grow asymptotically toward a
finite size. But when the ambient vapor pressure becomes supersaturated with
respect to that for the pure volatile solvent, the condensation growth of
droplet can continue indefinitely without bound.
