properly integrated, it provides the correct charge and current densities, but
it gives negative probabilities in some points and regions of the phase space.
Alternatively, the Husimi distribution function is positive-defined everywhere,
but it does not provide the correct charge and current densities. The origin of
all these difficulties is the attempt to construct a phase space within a
quantum theory that does not allow well-defined (i.e. simultaneous) values of
the position and momentum of an electron. In contrast, within the (de
Broglie-Bohm) Bohmian theory of quantum mechanics, an electron has well-defined
position and momentum. Therefore, such theory provides a natural definition of
the phase space probability distribution and by construction, it is
positive-defined and it exactly reproduces the charge and current densities.
The Bohmian distribution function has many potentialities for quantum problems,
in general, and for quantum transport, in particular, that remains unexplored.

Entanglement is directly generated between the single-atom quantum memory and a
photon at telecom wavelength. The latter is collected with high efficiency and
adjustable temporal and spectral properties into a spatially well-defined
cavity mode. It is heralded by a near-infrared photon emitted from a second,
orthogonal cavity. Entanglement between two remote quantum memories can be
generated via an optical Bell-state measurement, while we propose entanglement
swapping based on a highly efficient, cavity-assisted atom-atom gate. Our
quantum repeater scheme eliminates any requirement for wavelength conversion

particular implementation with rubidium and realistic parameters for
Fabry-Perot cavities based on CO$_2$ laser-machined optical fibers. We show

the effects of randomly distributed Stone Wales (SW or 5 7 7 5) defects on the
mechanical properties of single walled nanotubes (SWNTs) using the technique of
atomistic simulation (AS). A Matern hard core random field applied on a finite
cylindrical surface is used to describe the spatial distribution of the Stone
Wales defects. We simulate a set of displacement controlled tensile loading up
to fracture of SWNTs with (6,6) armchair and (10, 0) zigzag configurations and
aspect ratio around 6. A modified Morse potential is adopted to model the
interatomic forces. We found that fracture invariably initiates from a defect
if one is present; for a defect-free tube the crack initiates at quite random
locations. The force-displacement curve typically behaves almost linearly up to
about half way, although there is no obvious yield point. Three mechanical
properties - stiffness, ultimate strength and ultimate strain - are calculated
from the simulated force and displacement time histories. The randomness in
mechanical behavior resulting only from initial velocity distribution was found
to be insignificant at room temperature. The mean values of stiffness, ultimate
strength and ultimate strain of the tube decrease as the average number of
defects increases although the coefficients of variation do not show such
monotonic trend. The introduction of an additional defect has the most
pronounced effect on the randomness in mechanical properties when the tube is
originally defect free. We also found that, for a given mean number of defects
in the tube, the zigzag configuration has less strength and less ultimate
strain on the average, but more uncertainty in its stiffness and ultimate
strain, compared with the armchair tube.

energy concentrated inside. Here we propose and demonstrate an effective
approach to modify these channels, whose structures are considered to be
universal in conventional diffusive waveguides. By adjusting the waveguide
geometry, we are able to alter the spatial profiles of the transmission
eigenchannels significantly and deterministically from the universal ones. In
addition, propagating channels may be converted to evanescent channels or vice
versa by tapering the waveguide cross-section. Our approach allows to control
not only the transmitted and reflected light, but also the depth profile of
energy density inside the scattering system. In particular geometries perfect
reflection channels are created, and their large penetration depth into the
turbid medium as well as the complete return of probe light to the input end
would greatly benefit sensing and imaging applications. Absorption along with
geometry can be further employed for tuning the decay length of energy flux
inside the random system, which cannot be achieved in a common waveguide with

energy, establish whether they exhibit a characteristic energy gap, and
understand the evolution of all these phenomena throughout the phase diagram.
Here we use energy-resolved sublattice visualization$^{14}$ of electronic
structure and show that the characteristic energy of the dFF-DW modulations is
actually the 'pseudogap' energy $\Delta_{1}$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
dFF-DW modulations at $E=-\Delta_{1}$ (filled states) occur with relative phase
$\pi$ compared to those at $E=\Delta_{1}$ (empty states). Finally, we show that
the dFF-DW $Q$ corresponds directly to scattering between the 'hot frontier'
regions of $k$-space beyond which Bogoliubov quasiparticles cease to
exist$^{31,32,33}$. These data demonstrate that the dFF-DW state is consistent
with particle-hole interactions focused at the pseudogap energy scale and
between the four pairs of 'hot frontier' regions in $k$-space where the
pseudogap opens.

much taller than a set of neighboring waves. Their definition of ""unexpected""
refers to a wave that is not anticipated by a casual observer. Clearly,
unexpected waves defined in this way are predictable in a statistical sense.
They can occur relatively often with a small or moderate crest height, but
large unexpected waves that are rogue are rare. Here, this concept is
elaborated and statistically described based on a third-order nonlinear model.
In particular, the conditional return period of an unexpected wave whose crest
exceeds a given threshold is developed. This definition leads to greater return
periods or on average less frequent occurrences of unexpected waves than those
implied by the conventional return periods not conditioned on a reference
threshold. Ultimately, it appears that a rogue wave that is also unexpected
would have a lower occurrence frequency than that of a usual rogue wave. As
specific applications, the Andrea and WACSIS rogue wave events are examined in
detail. Both waves appeared without warning and their crests were nearly
$2$-times larger than the surrounding $O(10)$ wave crests, and thus unexpected.
The two crest heights are nearly the same as the
threshold~$h_{0.3\cdot10^{6}}\sim1.6H_{s}$ exceeded on average once
every~$0.3\cdot 10^{6}$ waves, where $H_s$ is the significant wave height. In
contrast, the Andrea and WACSIS events, as both rogue and unexpected, would
occur slightly less often and on average once every~$3\cdot10^{6}$
and~$0.6\cdot10^6$ waves respectively.

substantially extends the ranges of partial degeneracy for which the analytical
treatment remains valid.

with city size. However, the validity of their universal meaning for cities is
hampered by the observation that different scaling regimes can be encountered
for the same territory, time and attribute, depending on the criteria used to
delineate cities. The aim of this paper is to present new insights concerning
this variation, coupled with a sensitivity analysis of urban scaling in France,
for several socio-economic and infrastructural attributes from data collected
exhaustively at the local level. The sensitivity analysis considers different
aggregations of local units for which data are given by the Population Census.
We produce a large variety of definitions of cities (approximatively 5000) by
aggregating local Census units corresponding to the systematic combination of
three definitional criteria: density, commuting flows and population cutoffs.
We then measure the magnitude of scaling estimations and their sensitivity to
city definitions for several urban indicators, showing for example that simple
population cutoffs impact dramatically on the results obtained for a given
system and attribute. Variations are interpreted with respect to the meaning of
the attributes (socio-economic descriptors as well as infrastructure) and the
urban definitions used (understood as the combination of the three criteria).
Because of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem and of the heterogeneous
morphologies and social landscapes in the cities internal space, scaling
estimations are subject to large variations, distorting many of the conclusions
on which generative models are based. We conclude that examining scaling
variations might be an opportunity to understand better the inner composition
of cities with regard to their size, i.e. to link the scales of the city-system
with the system of cities.

scientific challenges. While these materials are typically viewed as doped Mott
insulators, it is well known that they are Fermi liquids at high hole-dopant
concentrations. It was recently demonstrated that at moderate doping, in the
pseudogap region of the phase diagram, the charge carriers are also best
described as Fermi liquid. Nevertheless, the relationship between the two
Fermi-liquid regions and the nature of the strange-metal state at intermediate
doping have remained unsolved. Here we show in the case of the model cuprate
superconductor HgBa2CuO4+{\delta} that the scattering rate measured by the
cotangent of the Hall angle remains quadratic in temperature across the
pseudogap temperature, upon entering the strange-metal state, and that it is
doping-independent below optimal doping. Analysis of the published results for
other cuprates reveals that this behavior is universal throughout the entire
phase diagram and points to a pervasive Fermi-liquid transport scattering rate.
We argue that these observations can be reconciled with other data upon
considering the possibility that the pseudogap phenomenon signifies the
completion of the gradual, non-uniform localization of one hole per planar CuO2
unit upon cooling.

which calculates probabilities on a gridded region based on six environmental
factors: groundwater depth, vegetation type, proximity to rivers, paved roads,
old river beds, and existing settlements. A parameter sweep, including millions
of simulations, was run with combinations of parameters related to these
factors. The sets of parameter values that minimized the residuals between
simulations and observations indicated the relative importance of each factors
on settlement distribution. Distances to rivers and old river beds were
critical to explain the current distribution of settlements, while vegetation,
paved roads, and water table depths were not important. Spatial distribution of
simulated vegetation, which included degradation around livestock settlements,
generally agreed with remotely sensed vegetation classes. The model could be a
useful tool to evaluate the effects of land use changes (water provision, river
flows), on settlement distribution and vegetation degradation in arid

Tisserand parameters similar to Jupiter family comets. Filtering all known NEOs

the help of the symplectic formalism of constrained systems and gauging the
model. The main idea of this approach is based on the embedding of the model in
an extended phase space. After the gauging process had done, we obtain
generators of gauge transformations of the model. Finally, by extracting the
corresponding Poisson structure of all constraints, we compare the effect of
gauging on the the phase spaces, the number of physical degrees of freedom, and
canonical structures of both primary and gauged models.

for perturbed chains of integrators of arbitrary order. This Higher Order
Super-Twisting (HOST) controller, which extends the approach of Moreno and

continuous. Its design is derived from a first result obtained for pure chains
of integrators, the latter relying on a geometric condition introduced by the
authors. The complete result is established using a homogeneous strict Lyapunov
function which is explicitely constructed. The effectiveness of the controller
is finally illustrated with simulations for a chain of integrator of order
four, first pure then perturbed, where we compare the performances of two HOST
controllers.

electric polarizability equals zero for 87Rb atoms in the F=2 ground hyperfine
state. The experiment uses a condensate interferometer both to find this
'tune-out' wavelength and to accurately determine the light polarization for
it. The wavelength lies between the D1 and D2 spectral lines at 790.03235(3)
nm. The measurement is sensitive to the tensor contribution to the
polarizability, which has been removed so that the reported value is the zero
of the scalar polarizability. The precision is fifty times better than previous
tune-out wavelength measurements. Our result can be used to determine the ratio
of matrix elements |<5P3/2||d||5S1/2>/<5P1/2||d||5S1/2>|^2 = 1.99219(3), a
100-fold improvement over previous experimental values. Both the tune-out
wavelength and matrix element ratio are consistent with theoretical
calculations, with uncertainty estimates for the theory about an order of
magnitude larger than the experimental precision.

  in Feedback in Lyman-alpha Emitting Galaxies","Accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/812/2/166",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lyman Break Analogs (LBA) are local proxies of high-redshift Lyman Break
Galaxies (LBG). Studies of nearby starbursts have shown that Lyman continuum
and line emission are absorbed by dust and that the Lyman-alpha is resonantly
scattered by neutral hydrogen. A source of feedback is required to prevent
scattering and allow the Lyman-alpha emission to escape. There are two X-ray
point sources embedded in the Lyman Break Analog (LBA) galaxy Haro 11. Haro 11
X-1 is an extremely luminous (L$_{X} \sim 10^{41}$ ergs s$^{-1}$), spatially
compact source with a hard X-ray spectrum. Haro 11 X-1 is similar to the
extreme Black Hole Binary (BHB) M82 X-1. The hard X-ray spectrum indicates Haro
11 X-1 may be a Black Hole Binary (BHB) in a low accretion state. The very high
X-ray luminosity suggests an intermediate mass black hole that could be the
seed for formation of a supermassive black hole. Source Haro 11 X-2 has an
X-ray luminosity L$_{X} \sim 5\times10^{40}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ and a soft X-ray
spectrum. This strongly suggests that Haro 11 X-2 is an X-ray binary in the
ultra luminous state. Haro 11 X-2 is coincident with the star forming knot that
is the source of the Lyman-alpha emission, raising the possibility that strong
winds from X-ray binaries play an important part in injecting mechanical power
into the Interstellar Medium (ISM), thus blowing away neutral material from the
starburst region and allowing the Lyman-alpha to escape. We suggest that
feedback from X-ray binaries may play a significant role in allowing
Lyman-alpha emission to escape from galaxies in the early universe.

Nash-equilibria in two-person zero-sum sequential games with incomplete

numerically stable, performs only basic iterations (i.e matvec multiplications,
clipping, etc., and no calls to external first-order oracles, no matrix
inversions, etc.), and is applicable to a broad class of two-person zero-sum
games including simultaneous games and sequential games with incomplete
information and perfect recall. The applicability to the latter kind of games
is thanks to the sequence-form representation which allows us to encode any
such game as a matrix game with convex polytopial strategy profiles. We prove
that the number of iterations needed to produce a Nash-equilibrium with a given
precision is inversely proportional to the precision. As proof-of-concept, we
present experimental results on matrix games on simplexes and Kuhn Poker.

out that many natural data/topology properties of graphs expressible in WL
cannot be expressed in REM. To this end, we propose register logic, an

information about a system's state is required for its macroscopic description.
This is not only true for thermal ensembles, but also for the unconventional
ensemble, known as Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), that is expected to
describe the relaxation of integrable systems after a quantum quench. By
analytically studying the quench dynamics in a prototypical one-dimensional
critical model, the massless free bosonic field theory, we find evidence of a
novel type of equilibration characterized by the preservation of an enormous
amount of memory of the initial state that is accessible by local measurements.
In particular, we show that the equilibration retains memory of non-Gaussian
initial correlations, in contrast to the case of massive free evolution which
erases all such memory. The GGE in its standard form, being a Gaussian
ensemble, fails to predict correctly the equilibrium values of local
observables, unless the initial state is Gaussian itself. Our findings show
that the equilibration of a broad class of quenches whose evolution is
described by Luttinger liquid theory with an initial state that is non-Gaussian
in terms of the bosonic field, is not correctly captured by the corresponding
bosonic GGE, raising doubts about the validity of the latter in general
one-dimensional gapless integrable systems such as the Lieb-Liniger model. We
also propose that the same experiment by which the GGE was recently observed
[Langen et al., Science 348 (2015) 207-211] can also be used to observe its
failure, simply by starting from a non-Gaussian initial state.

three of which reside within the likely virial radius of the quasar host,
suggesting that the system will evolve into a massive elliptical galaxy by the

Lyalpha emission line into narrow velocity channels. In these the gas can be
seen extending towards each of the three neighbouring galaxies suggesting that
the emission-line gas originates in a gravitational interaction between the
galaxies and the quasar host. The photoionization source of this gas is less
clear but is probably dominated by the two AGN. The quasar's Lyalpha emission
spectrum is double-peaked, likely due to absorbing neutral material at the
quasar's systemic redshift with a low column density as no damping wings are
present. The spectral profiles of the AGN and bridge's Lyalpha emission are
also consistent with absorption at the same redshift indicating this neutral
material may extend over > 50 kpc. The fact that the neutral material is seen
in the line of sight to the quasar and transverse to it, and the fact that we
see the quasar and it also illuminates the emission-line bridge, suggests the
quasar radiates isotropically and any obscuring torus is small. These results

signature of gamma-ray excess in indirect detection experiments of dark matter
(DM), postulating a generic dark sector having (at least) two DM candidates.
With the assumption of non-zero mass gap between the two DM candidates, the
heavier one directly communicates to the partner of the lighter one. Such a
partner then decays into a lighter DM particle along with an ""axion-like""
particle (ALP) or dark ""pion"", which subsequently decays into a pair of
photons, via a more-than-one step cascade decay process. Since the cascade is
initiated by the dark partner obtaining a non-trivial fixed boost factor, a
continuum gamma-ray energy spectrum naturally arises even with a particle
directly decaying into two photons. We apply the main idea to the energy
spectrum of the GeV gamma-rays from around the Galactic Center (GC), and find
that the relevant observational data is well-reproduced by the theory
expectation predicted by the proposed mechanism. Remarkably, the relevant
energy spectrum has a robust peak at half the mass of the ALP or dark pion, as

For far-IR light, we calculate the dipole matrix elements between the

near-IR light, spin-selective excitation is possible for all the donors by
driving a two-photon $\Lambda$-transition from the ground state to higher

fraction for Coma ($20\pm2\%$). Thus, galaxy bars play an important role in
formation of broken disc structures. No strong variation in galaxy structure is

recently experienced maximal ram pressure stripping, suggesting the current
extent of its HI disk directly probes the medium in which it is moving. From
the observed stellar and HI distributions of the system we find evidence of a
truncated gas profile along the windward ``leading edge' of the LMC disk,
despite a far more extended stellar component. We explore the implications of
this ram pressure stripping signature, using both analytic prescriptions and
full 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the LMC. Our simulations subject
the system to a headwind whose velocity components correspond directly to the
recent orbital history of the LMC. We vary the density of this headwind, using
a variety of sampled parameters for a Beta-profile for a theoretical MW
circumgalactic medium (CGM), comparing the resulting HI morphology directly to
observations of the LMC HI and stellar components. This model can match the
radial extent of the LMC's leading (windward) edge only in scenarios where the
MW CGM density at pericentric passage is n(R = 48.2 +/- 5 kpc) = 1.1
(+.44/-.45) x 1e-4 cm^-3. The implied pericentric density proves insensitive to
both the broader CGM structure and temperature profile, thus providing a
model-independent constraint on the local gas density. This result imposes an
important constraint on the density profile of the MW's CGM, and thus the total
baryon content of the MW. From our work, assuming a Beta-profile valid to ~
Rvir, we infer a total diffuse CGM mass M(300 kpc) = 2.6 +/- 1.4 x 1e10 Msun or

on integral field data to separate the contribution of two stellar components
to the observed galaxy spectrum across the field of view. We also performed a
photometric decomposition, modelling the galaxy with a S\'ersic bulge and two
exponential disks of different scale length, with the aim of associating these
structural components with the kinematic components. We measured the equivalent
width of the absorption line indices on the best fit that represent the
kinematic components and compared our measurements to the predictions of
stellar population models. We have evidence that the line-of-sight velocity
distributions (LOSVDs) are consistent with the presence of two distinct
kinematic components. The combined information of the intensity of the LOSVDs
and photometry allows us to associate the S\'ersic bulge and the outer disk
with the main kinematic component, and the inner disk with the secondary
kinematic component. The two kinematic stellar components counter-rotate with
respect to each other. The main component is the most luminous and massive, and
it rotates slower than the secondary component, which rotates along the same
direction as the ionized gas. We also found that the two kinematic components
have the same solar metallicity and sub-solar abundance ratio, without the
presence of significant radial gradients. On the other hand, their ages show
strong negative gradients and the possible indication that the secondary

commonly employed in strong gravitational lensing studies, including the
so-called time-delay technique used to infer the Hubble constant $H_0$.
However, since the radial scale at which strong lensing features are formed
corresponds to the transition from the dominance of baryonic matter to dark
matter, there is no known reason why galaxies should follow a power law in
density. The assumption of a power law artificially breaks the mass-sheet
degeneracy, a well-known invariance transformation in gravitational lensing
which affects the product of Hubble constant and time delay and can therefore
cause a bias in the determination of $H_0$ from the time-delay technique. In
this paper, we use the Illustris hydrodynamical simulations to estimate the
amplitude of this bias, and to understand how it is related to observational
properties of galaxies. Investigating a large sample of Illustris galaxies that
have velocity dispersion $\sigma_{SIE}$>160 km/s at redshifts below $z=1$, we
find that the bias on $H_0$ introduced by the power-law assumption can reach
20%-50%, with a scatter of $10\%-30\%$ (rms). However, we find that by
selecting galaxies with an inferred power-law model slope close to isothermal,
it is possible to reduce the bias on $H_0$ to <5%, and the scatter to <10%.

(stellar mass M > 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at
$z$=1.0-1.5 from the analysis of spectro-photometric data from the SHARDS and
HST/WFC3 G102 and G141 surveys of the GOODS-N field, jointly with broad-band
observations from ultraviolet (UV) to far-infrared (Far-IR). The sample is
constructed on the basis of rest-frame UVJ colours and specific star formation
rates (sSFR=SFR/Mass). The Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of each galaxy
are compared to models assuming a delayed exponentially declining SFH. A Monte
Carlo algorithm characterizes the degeneracies, which we are able to break
taking advantage of the SHARDS data resolution, by measuring indices such as
MgUV and D4000. The population of MQGs shows a duality in their properties. The
sample is dominated (85%) by galaxies with young mass-weighted ages, tM $<$ 2
Gyr, short star formation timescales, $\langle \tau \rangle$ $\sim$ 60-200 Myr,
and masses log(M/M$_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 10.5. There is an older population (15%)
with tM$=$2 - 4 Gyr, longer star formation timescales, $\langle \tau
\rangle$$\sim$ 400 Myr, and larger masses, log(M/M$_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 10.7. The
SFHs of our MQGs are consistent with the slope and the location of the Main
Sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies at $z$ $>$ 1.0, when our galaxies were
0.5-1.0 Gyr old. According to these SFHs, all the MQGs experienced a Luminous
Infrared Galaxy (LIRG) phase that lasts for $\sim$ 500 Myr, and half of them an
Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) phase for $\sim$ 100 Myr. We find that
the MQG population is almost assembled at $z$ $\sim$ 1, and continues evolving
passively with few additions to the population.

EW$_{\mathrm{rf}}$([OII]) closely follows the SFR density evolution of the
universe, with a trend of EW$_{\mathrm{rf}}$([OII])$\propto$(1+z)$^3$ up to
redshift z~1, followed by a possible flattening. The SF properties of the
galaxies selected on the basis of their [OII] emission are compared with
complementary samples of SFGs selected by their MIR and FIR emission, and also
with a general mass-selected sample of galaxies at the same redshifts. We
demonstrate observationally that the UVJ diagram (or, similarly, a cut in the
specific SFR) is only partially able to distinguish the quiescent galaxies from
the SFGs. The SFR-M$_*$ relation is investigated for the different samples,
yelding a logarithmic slope ~1, in good agreement with previous results. The
dust attenuations derived from different SFR indicators (UV(1600), UV(2800),

affected by stronger dust attenuation.

determining surface pressure and potential habitability. Molecular nitrogen
(N$_2$) constitutes the largest fraction of Earth$'$s atmosphere and is likely
to be a major constituent of many terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres. Due to its
lack of significant absorption features, N$_2$ is extremely difficult to
remotely detect. However, N$_2$ produces an N$_2$-N$_2$ collisional pair,
(N$_2$)$_2$, which is spectrally active. Here we report the detection of
(N$_2$)$_2$ in Earth$'$s disk-integrated spectrum. By comparing spectra from
NASA$'$s EPOXI mission to synthetic spectra from the NASA Astrobiology
Institute$'$s Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional spectral Earth
model, we find that (N$_2$)$_2$ absorption produces a ~35$\%$ decrease in flux
at 4.15 $\mu$m. Quantifying N$_2$ could provide a means of determining bulk
atmospheric composition for terrestrial exoplanets and could rule out abiotic
O$_2$ generation, which is possible in rarefied atmospheres. To explore the
potential effects of (N$_2$)$_2$ in exoplanet spectra, we used radiative
transfer models to generate synthetic emission and transit transmission spectra
of self-consistent N$_2$-CO$_2$-H$_2$O atmospheres, and analytic N$_2$-H$_2$
and N$_2$-H$_2$-CO$_2$ atmospheres. We show that (N$_2$)$_2$ absorption in the
wings of the 4.3 $\mu$m CO$_2$ band is strongly dependent on N$_2$ partial
pressures above 0.5 bar and can significantly widen this band in thick N$_2$
atmospheres. The (N$_2$)$_2$ transit transmission signal is up to 10 ppm for an
Earth-size planet with an N$_2$-dominated atmosphere orbiting within the HZ of
an M5V star and could be substantially larger for planets with significant
H$_2$ mixing ratios.

The importance of this spacetime is the following: for the causally best well
behaved spacetimes (the globally hyperbolic ones), there are several
characterizations or alternative definitions. In some cases, it has been shown
that some of the causal properties required in these characterizations can be
weakened. But Carter spacetime provides a counterexample for an impossible

surface cutting a volume from a polar liquid will carry an effective non-zero
surface charge density when preferential orientation of dipoles exists in the
interface. This effective charge will experience a non-vanishing drag in an
external electric field even in the absence of free charge carriers. Numerical
simulations of model solutes are used to estimate the magnitude of the surface
charge density. We find it to be comparable to the values typically reported
from the mobility measurements. Hydrated ions can potentially carry a
significant excess of the effective charge due to over-polarization of the
interface. As a result, the electrokinetic charge can significantly deviate
from the physical charge of free charge carriers. We propose to test the model
by manipulating the polarizability of hydrated semiconductor nanoparticles with
light. The inversion of the mobility direction can be achieved by
photoexcitation, which increases the nanoparticle polarizability and leads to
an inversion of the dipolar orientations of water molecules in the interface.

the projected two-point cross-correlation function, the background-subtracted
number count of neighbor galaxies, the overdensity of the local environment,
the membership of our galaxies to galaxy groups to segregate central and
satellite systems, and for central galaxies we estimate the stellar to halo
mass ratio (M$_{\mathrm{*}}/$M$_{\mathrm{h}}$) . When we split our sample into
early- and late-type galaxies, we see a weak but significant trend for
early-type galaxies with a bar to be more strongly clustered on scales from a
few 100 kpc to 1 Mpc when compared to unbarred early-type galaxies. This
indicates that the presence of a bar in early-type galaxies depends on the
location within their host dark matter halos. This is confirmed by the group
catalog in the sense that for early-types, the fraction of central galaxies is
smaller if they have a bar. For late-type galaxies, we find fewer neighbors
within $\sim50$ kpc around the barred galaxies when compared to unbarred
galaxies from the control sample, suggesting that tidal forces from close
companions suppress the formation/growth of bars. For central late-type
galaxies, bars are more common on galaxies with high
M$_{\mathrm{*}}/$M$_{\mathrm{h}}$ values, as expected from early theoretical
works which showed that systems with massive dark matter halos are more stable
against bar instabilities. Finally, we find no obvious correlation between

  Labels","Currently under review",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we focus on the problem of learning a classification model that
performs inference on patient Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Often, a large
amount of costly expert supervision is required to learn such a model. To
reduce this cost, we obtain confidence labels that indicate how sure an expert
is in the class labels she provides. If meaningful confidence information can
be incorporated into a learning method, fewer patient instances may need to be
labeled to learn an accurate model. In addition, while accuracy of predictions
is important for any inference model, a model of patients must be interpretable
so that clinicians can understand how the model is making decisions. To these
ends, we develop a novel metric learning method called Confidence bAsed MEtric
Learning (CAMEL) that supports inclusion of confidence labels, but also
emphasizes interpretability in three ways. First, our method induces sparsity,
thus producing simple models that use only a few features from patient EHRs.
Second, CAMEL naturally produces confidence scores that can be taken into
consideration when clinicians make treatment decisions. Third, the metrics
learned by CAMEL induce multidimensional spaces where each dimension represents
a different ""factor"" that clinicians can use to assess patients. In our
experimental evaluation, we show on a real-world clinical data set that our
CAMEL methods are able to learn models that are as or more accurate as other
methods that use the same supervision. Furthermore, we show that when CAMEL
uses confidence scores it is able to learn models as or more accurate as others
we tested while using only 10% of the training instances. Finally, we perform
qualitative assessments on the metrics learned by CAMEL and show that they
identify and clearly articulate important factors in how the model performs
inference.

efficiently in protoplanetary disks, that most of these migrate rapidly to the
disk's inner edge, and that, if the arriving planet's mass is $\lesssim$
Jupiter's mass, it could remain stranded near that radius. We argue that such
planets would be ingested by tidal interaction with the host star on a
timescale $\lesssim1\,$Gyr, and that, in the case of a solar-type host, this
would cause the stellar spin to approach the direction of the ingested planet's
orbital axis even if the two were initially highly misaligned. Primordially
misaligned stars whose effective temperatures are $\gtrsim6250\,$K cannot be
realigned in this way because, in contrast with solar-type hosts, their angular
momenta are typically higher than the orbital angular momentum of the ingested
planet as a result of inefficient magnetic braking and of a comparatively large
moment of inertia. Hot Jupiters located farther out from the star can
contribute to this process, but their effect is weaker because the tidal
interaction strength decreases rapidly with increasing semimajor axis. We
demonstrate that, if $\sim50\%$ of planetary systems harbored a stranded hot
Jupiter, this scenario can in principle account for (1) the good alignment
exhibited by planets around cool stars irrespective of the planet's mass or
orbital period, (2) the prevalence of misaligned planets around hot stars, (3)
the apparent upper bound on the mass of hot Jupiters on retrograde orbits, and
(4) the inverse correlation between stellar spin periods and hot-Jupiter
masses.

blueshifted non-resonant emission, Fe II*, and blueshifted resonant absorption,
e.g., Fe II and Mg II, indicating ubiquitous outflows driven by star formation
at these redshifts. For the absorption lines, we find a variety of velocity
profiles with different degrees of blueshift. Comparing our new observations
with the literature, we do not observe the non-resonant emission in the
small-aperture (<40 pc) spectra of local star-forming regions with the Hubble
Space Telescope, and find the observed line ratios in the SFG spectra to be
different from those in the spectra of local star-forming regions, as well as
those of quasar absorption-line systems in the same redshift range. We
introduce an outflow model that can simultaneously explain the multiple
observed properties and suggest that the variety of absorption velocity
profiles and the line ratio differences are caused by scattered fluorescent
emission filling in on top of the absorption in the large-aperture eBOSS
spectra. We develop an observation-driven, model-independent method to correct
the emission-infill to reveal the true absorption profiles. Our results show
that eBOSS and future dark-energy surveys (e.g., DESI and PFS) will provide
rich datasets of NUV spectroscopy for astrophysical applications.

structures in our Universe, galaxy clusters, is fundamental to understanding
their evolution. Gas in clusters is well studied in the hot ($>$ 10$^{6}$ K)
and cold ($<$ 10$^{4}$ K) regimes, but the warm gas component (10$^{4}$ -
10$^{6}$ K) is poorly constrained. It is challenging to observe directly, but
can be probed through Ly$\alpha$ absorption studies. We produce the first
systematic study of the warm gas content of galaxy clusters through synthetic
Ly$\alpha$ absorption studies using cosmological simulations of two galaxy
clusters produced with Enzo. We explore the spatial and kinematic properties of
our cluster absorbers, and show that the majority of the identified absorbers
are due to fast moving gas associated with cluster infall from IGM filaments.
Towards the center of the clusters, however, the warm IGM filaments are no
longer dominant and the absorbers tend to have higher column densities and
metallicities, representing stripped galaxy material. We predict that the
absorber velocity distribution should generally be bi-modal and discuss the
effects of cluster size, mass, and morphology on the properties of the
identified absorbers, and the overall cluster warm gas content. We find
tentative evidence for a change in the well known increasing N$_{HI}$ with
decreasing impact parameter for the most massive dark matter halos. Our results
are compared directly to observations of Ly$\alpha$ absorbers in the Virgo
cluster, and provide predictions for future Ly$\alpha$ absorption studies.

rotate, at every point in a flow. The interest in performing accurate and
localized measurements of vorticity reflects the fact that many of the
quantities that characterize the dynamics of fluids are intimately bound
together in the vorticity field, being an efficient descriptor of the velocity
statistics in many flow regimes. It describes the coherent structures and
vortex interactions that are at the leading edge of laminar, transitional, and
turbulent flows in nature. The measurement of vorticity is of paramount
importance in many research fields as diverse as biology microfluidics, complex
motions in the oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers, and wake turbulence on
fluid aerodynamics. However, the precise measurement of flow vorticity is
difficult. Here we put forward an optical sensing technique to obtain a direct
measurement of vorticity in fluids using Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beams, optical
beams which show an azimuthal phase variation that is the origin of its
characteristic non-zero orbital angular momentum. The key point is to make use
of the transversal Doppler effect of the returned signal that depends only on
the azimuthal component of the flow velocity along the ring-shaped observation
beam. We found from a detailed analysis of the experimental method that probing
the fluid with LG beams is an effective and simple sensing technique capable to
produce accurate estimates of flow vorticity.

as physics, chemistry, ecology and biology. The fundamental quantities in such
models are individual entities such as atoms and molecules, bacteria, cells or
animals, which move and/or react in a stochastic manner. If the number of
entities is large, accounting for each individual is inefficient, and often
partial differential equation (PDE) models are used in which the stochastic
behaviour of individuals is replaced by a description of the averaged, or mean
behaviour of the system. In some situations the number of individuals is large
in certain regions and small in others. In such cases, a stochastic model may
be inefficient in one region, and a PDE model inaccurate in another. To
overcome this problem, we develop a scheme which couples a stochastic
reaction-diffusion system in one part of the domain with its mean field
analogue, i.e. a discretised PDE model, in the other part of the domain. The
interface in between the two domains occupies exactly one lattice site and is
chosen such that the mean field description is still accurate there. This way
errors due to the flux between the domains are small. Our scheme can account
for multiple dynamic interfaces separating multiple stochastic and
deterministic domains, and the coupling between the domains conserves the total
number of particles. The method preserves stochastic features such as
extinction not observable in the mean field description, and is significantly
faster to simulate on a computer than the pure stochastic model.

photovoltaic (PV) powered EV charging station (CS) that reduces the effect of
intermittency of electricity supply as well as reducing the cost of energy
trading of the CS. Since not all EV drivers would like to be environmentally
friendly, all vehicles in the CS are divided into three categories: 1) premium,
2) conservative, and 3) green, according to their charging behavior. Premium
and conservative EVs are considered to be interested only in charging their
batteries, with noticeably higher rate of charging for premium EVs. Green
vehicles are more environmentally friendly, and thus assist the CS to reduce
its cost of energy trading by allowing the CS to use their batteries as
distributed storage. A different charging scheme is proposed for each type of
EV, which is adopted by the CS to encourage more EVs to be green. A basic mixed
integer programming (MIP) technique is used to facilitate the proposed
classification scheme. It is shown that the uncertainty in PV generation can be
effectively compensated, along with minimization of total cost of energy
trading to the CS, by consolidating more green EVs. Real solar and pricing data
are used for performance analysis of the system. It is demonstrated that the
total cost to the CS reduces considerably as the percentage of green vehicles
increases, and also that the contributions of green EVs in winter are greater
than those in summer.

present a detailed description and test results of a compressible radiative MHD

surface, and atmospheres of the Sun and moderate-mass stars. The code solves
the three-dimensional, fully coupled compressible MHD equations using a
fourth-order Pad\'e spatial differentiation scheme and a fourth-order
Runge-Kutta scheme for time integration. The radiative transfer equation is
solved using the Feautrier method for bi-directional ray tracing and an
opacity-binning technique. A specific feature of the code is the implementation
of subgrid-scale MHD turbulence models. The data structures are automatically
configured, depending on the computational grid and the number of available

illustrate the code's capabilities for simulating the granular convection on

affect properties of the surface magnetic fields. For example, in the solar
case initially uniform vertical magnetic fields tend to self-organize into
compact (pore-like) magnetic structures, while in more massive stars such

superconducting wires, this splitting has an oscillatory dependence on the
chemical potential, which arises from an intrinsic Berry phase that produces
interference between distinct instanton tunneling events. These Berry phases
can be mapped to chiral phases in a (dual) quantum clock model using a

One of the most promising applications of skyrmion is to build racetrack memory
(RM). Compared to domain wall-based RM (DW-RM), skyrmion-based RM (Sky-RM)
possesses quite a few benefits in terms of energy, density and speed etc. Until
now, the fundamental behaviors, including nucleation/annihilation, motion and
detection of skyrmion have been intensively investigated. However, one
indispensable function, i.e., pinning/depinning of skyrmion still remains an
open question and has to be addressed before applying skyrmion for RM.
Furthermore, Current research mainly focuses on physical investigations,
whereas the electrical design and evaluation are still lacking. In this work,
we aim to promote the development of Sky-RM from fundamental physics to

during a search for new members of the 30-40 Myr-old Octans Association. Only
one of the stars may be considered a possible Octans(-Near) member. However,
two stars have proper motions, kinematic distances, radial velocities,
photometry and Li I 6708AA measurements consistent with membership in the 8-10
Myr-old TW Hydrae Association. Another may be an outlying member of TW Hydrae
but has a velocity similar to that predicted by membership in Octans. We also
identify two new lithium-rich members of the neighbouring Scorpius-Centaurus OB
Association (Sco-Cen). Both exhibit large 12 and 22 micron excesses and strong,
variable H-alpha emission which we attribute to accretion from circumstellar
discs. Such stars are thought to be incredibly rare at the ~16 Myr median age
of Sco-Cen and they join only one other confirmed M-type and three higher-mass
accretors outside of Upper Scorpius. The serendipitous discovery of two
accreting stars hosting large quantities of circumstellar material may be
indicative of a sizeable age spread in Sco-Cen, or further evidence that disc
dispersal and planet formation time-scales are longer around lower-mass stars.
To aid future studies of Sco-Cen we also provide a newly-compiled catalogue of
305 early-type Hipparcos members with spectroscopic radial velocities sourced
from the literature.

tends to converge at [Fe/H]~ -1.7 at larger Galactic latitudes. This variation
may be related to that the RRAB Lyrae stars in the Galactic halo come from
globular clusters with different metallicity and vertical distances, i.e. OoI

micro instabilities like two stream, filamentation etc., in plasma. This
results in severe limitation of the electron transport through a plasma medium.
Recently, however, there has been an experimental demonstration of improved
transport of Mega Ampere of electron currents (generated by the interaction of
intense laser with solid target) in a carbon nanotube structured solid target
[Phys. Rev Letts. 108, 235005 (2012)]. This then suggests that the
inhomogeneous plasma (created by the ionization of carbon nano tube structured
target) helps in containing the growth of the beam plasma instabilities. This
manuscript addresses this issue with the help of a detailed analytical study
and simulations with the help of 2-D Particle - In - Cell code. The study
conclusively demonstrates that the growth rate of the dominant instability in
the 2-D geometry decreases when the plasma density is chosen to be
inhomogeneous, provided the scale length 1/ks of the inhomogeneous plasma is
less than the typical plasma skin depth (c/{\omega}p0 ) scale. At such small
scale lengths channelization of currents are also observed in simulation.

in a series of papers by Zames and Owen in the early 1990s in conjunction with
a non-standard definition, which together are true, but the theorem is false

failure of this theorem are discussed; in particular, the fact that the
Hahn-Banach Theorem cannot be guaranteed to provide an extension which is an
element of the predual space. The condition needed to restore the theorem is
derived; namely, that the annihilator of the pre-annihilator return the

problem well suited to model resource allocation under uncertainty in a wide
variety of contexts. Since the first publication of the optimal solution of the
classic MABP by a dynamic index rule, the bandit literature quickly diversified
and emerged as an active research topic. Across this literature, the use of
bandit models to optimally design clinical trials became a typical motivating
application, yet little of the resulting theory has ever been used in the
actual design and analysis of clinical trials. To this end, we review two MABP
decision-theoretic approaches to the optimal allocation of treatments in a
clinical trial: the infinite-horizon Bayesian Bernoulli MABP and the
finite-horizon variant. These models possess distinct theoretical properties
and lead to separate allocation rules in a clinical trial design context. We
evaluate their performance compared to other allocation rules, including fixed
randomization. Our results indicate that bandit approaches offer significant
advantages, in terms of assigning more patients to better treatments, and
severe limitations, in terms of their resulting statistical power. We propose a
novel bandit-based patient allocation rule that overcomes the issue of low
power, thus removing a potential barrier for their use in practice.

we provide means to reduce the computational cost of reconstruction by way of

directly obtained from the projection dataset and prior to any reconstruction.
It is built following two stages : firstly, 2D structural information is
extracted from the projection images and is secondly merged in 3D to obtain a
3D pointcloud sampling the interfaces of the object. A relevant mesh is then
built from this cloud by way of tetrahedralization. Critical parameters
selections have been automatized through a statistical framework, thus avoiding
dependence on users expertise. Applying this approach on geometrical shapes and
on a 3D Shepp-Logan phantom, we show the relevance of such a sampling -
obtained in a few seconds - and the drastic decrease in cells number to be
estimated during reconstruction when compared to the usual regular voxel
lattice. A first iterative reconstruction of the Shepp-Logan using this kind of
sampling shows the relevant advantages in terms of low dose or sparse
acquisition sampling contexts. The method can also prove useful for other

pattern formation in a thin elastic sheet is of particular interest because the
length scale of folding varies with height. We focus on how the minimum elastic
energy depends on the physical parameters. As the sheet thickness vanishes, the
limiting energy is due to the gravitational force and is relatively easy to
understand. Our main accomplishment is to identify the ""scaling law"" of the
correction due to positive thickness. We do this by (i) proving an upper bound,
by considering the energies of several constructions and taking the best; (ii)
proving an ansatz-free lower bound, which agrees with the upper bound up to a
parameter-independent prefactor. The coarsening of folds in hanging drapes has
also been considered in the recent physics literature, using a self-similar
construction whose basic cell has been called a ""wrinklon."" Our results
complement and extend that work, by showing that self-similar coarsening
achieves the optimal scaling law in a certain parameter regime, and by showing
that other constructions (involving lateral spreading of the sheet) do better
in other regions of parameter space. Our analysis uses a geometrically linear

selection in regression refer to pairwise consistency, that is, consistency of
Bayes factors. However, variable selection in regression is carried out in a
given class of regression models where a natural variable selector is the
posterior probability of the models. In this paper we analyze the consistency
of the posterior model probabilities when the number of potential regressors
grows as the sample size grows. The novelty in the posterior model consistency
is that it depends not only on the priors for the model parameters through the
Bayes factor, but also on the model priors, so that it is a useful tool for
choosing priors for both models and model parameters. We have found that some
classes of priors typically used in variable selection yield posterior model
inconsistency, while mixtures of these priors improve this undesirable
behavior. For moderate sample sizes, we evaluate Bayesian pairwise variable
selection procedures by comparing their frequentist Type I and II error
probabilities. This provides valuable information to discriminate between the
priors for the model parameters commonly used for variable selection.

bidders is a fundamental problem in mechanism design. Myerson (1981) shows that
the second price auction with an appropriate reserve price is optimal when
bidders' values are drawn i.i.d. from a known regular distribution. A
cornerstone in the prior-independent revenue maximization literature is a
result by Bulow and Klemperer (1996) showing that the second price auction
without a reserve achieves $(n-1)/n$ of the optimal revenue in the worst case.
  We construct a randomized mechanism that strictly outperforms the second
price auction in this setting. Our mechanism inflates the second highest bid
with a probability that varies with $n$. For two bidders we improve the
performance guarantee from $0.5$ to $0.512$ of the optimal revenue. We also
resolve a question in the design of revenue optimal mechanisms that have access
to a single sample from an unknown distribution. We show that a randomized
mechanism strictly outperforms all deterministic mechanisms in terms of worst

proposed ensemble algorithm calculates an ensemble weight for each CRC model

properties of the double sequence of the Milky Way discs (defined chemically as

  This investigation uses two different approaches: in velocity space for stars
located in the extended Solar neighbourhood, and in chemical space for stars at
different ranges of Galactocentric radii and heights from the plane. The
separation we find in velocity space allows us to investigate, in a novel
manner, the extent in metallicity of each of the two sequences, identifying
them with the two discs, without making any assumption about the shape of their
metallicity distribution functions. Then, using the separation in chemical
space, we characterise the spatial variation of the slopes of the [alpha/Fe] -
[Fe/H] sequences for the thick and thin discs and the way in which the relative
proportions of the two discs change across the Galaxy.
  We find that the thick disc (high-alpha sequence), extends up to [Fe/H]~ +0.2
and the thin disc (low-alpha sequence), at least down to [Fe/H]~ -0.8. Radial
and vertical gradients in alpha-abundances are found for the thin disc, with
mild spatial variations in its [alpha/Fe] - [Fe/H] paths, whereas for the thick
disc we do not detect any such spatial variations.
  The small variations in the spatial [alpha/Fe] - [Fe/H] paths of the thin
disc do not allow us to distinguish between formation models of this structure.
On the other hand, the lack of radial gradients and [alpha/Fe] - [Fe/H]
variations for the thick disc indicate that the mechanism responsible for the
mixing of the metals in the young Galaxy (e.g. radial stellar migration or
turbulent gaseous disc) was more efficient before the (present) thin disc
started forming.

(RM) effect to measure the Rayleigh-scattering slope in the transmission
spectrum of HD 189733b with the aim to show that it can be effectively used to
measure broadband transmission features. The amplitude of the RM effects
depends on the effective size of the planet, and in the case of an atmospheric
contribution therefore depends on the observed wavelength. We analysed archival
HARPS data of three transits of HD 189733b, covering a wavelength range of 400
to 700 nm. We measured the slope in the transmission spectrum of HD 189733b at
a $2.5\sigma$ significance. Assuming it is due to Rayleigh scattering and not
caused by stellar activity, it would correspond to an atmospheric temperature,
as set by the scale height, of $T = 2300 \pm 900 \mathrm{K}$, well in line with
previously obtained results. This shows that ground-based high-dispersion
spectral observations can be used to probe broad-band features in the
transmission spectra of extrasolar planets, by using the chromatic RM effect.
This method will be particularly interesting in conjunction with the new
echelle spectrograph ESPRESSO, which currently is under construction for ESOs
Very Large Telescope and will provide a gain in signal-to-noise ratio of about
a factor 4 compared to HARPS. This will be of great value because of the

symmetrically coupled to all others with full permutation symmetry $S_N$ are
found in a variety of applications. Much, but not all, work on phase
descriptions of such systems consider the special case of pairwise coupling
between oscillators. In this paper, we show this is restrictive - and we
characterise generic multi-way interactions between oscillators that are
typically present, except at the very lowest order near a Hopf bifurcation
where the oscillations emerge. We examine a network of identical weakly coupled
dynamical systems that are close to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation by
considering two parameters, $\epsilon$ (the strength of coupling) and $\lambda$
(an unfolding parameter for the Hopf bifurcation). For small enough $\lambda>0$
there is an attractor that is the product of $N$ stable limit cycles; this
persists as a normally hyperbolic invariant torus for sufficiently small
$\epsilon>0$. Using equivariant normal form theory, we derive a generic normal
form for a system of coupled phase oscillators with $S_N$ symmetry. For fixed
$N$ and taking the limit $0<\epsilon\ll\lambda\ll 1$, we show that the
attracting dynamics of the system on the torus can be well approximated by a
coupled phase oscillator system that, to lowest order, is the well-known
Kuramoto-Sakaguchi system of coupled oscillators. The next order of
approximation genericlly includes terms with up to four interacting phases,
regardless of $N$. Using a normalization that maintains nontrivial interactions
in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, we show that the additional terms can lead
to new phenomena in terms of coexistence of two-cluster states with the same
phase difference but different cluster size.

describes, for each $p\in P$, the order in which a ray that rotates around $p$
encounters the points in $P \setminus \{p\}$. This notion is related to the
order type of $P$, which describes the orientation (clockwise or
counterclockwise) of every ordered triple in $P$. Given only the order type,
the radial system is uniquely determined and can easily be obtained. The
converse, however, is not true. Indeed, let $R$ be the radial system of $P$,
and let $T(R)$ be the set of all order types with radial system $R$ (we define
$T(R) = \emptyset$ for the case that $R$ is not a valid radial system).
Aichholzer et al. (Reconstructing Point Set Order Types from Radial Orderings,
in ISAAC 2014) show that $T(R)$ may contain up to $n-1$ order types. They also
provide polynomial-time algorithms to compute $T(R)$ when only $R$ is given.
  We describe a new algorithm for finding $T(R)$. The algorithm constructs the
convex hulls of all possible point sets with the radial system $R$. After that,
orientation queries on point triples can be answered in constant time. A
representation of this set of convex hulls can be found in $O(n)$ queries to
the radial system, using $O(n)$ additional processing time. This is optimal.
Our results also generalize to abstract order types.

quadratic programming problem (QP) whose decision variables are link flows,
demands at entry links, and turn movements at intersections, subject to linear
constraints imposed by flow conservation identities and field measurements of a
subset of link flows (counts), demands and turn ratios. The quadratic objective
function is the deviation of the decision variables from their measured values.
The solution to the QP gives estimates of all unmeasured variables and thus
yields a fully specified simulation model. Runs of this simulation model can
then be compared with other field measurements, such as travel times along
routes, to judge the reliability of the calibrated model. A section of the
Huntington-Colorado arterial near I-210 in Los Angeles comprising 73 links and
16 intersections is used to illustrate the procedure. Two experiments are
conducted with the calibrated model to determine the maximum traffic that can
be diverted from the I-210 freeway to the arterial network, with and without
permitting changes in the timing plans. The maximum diversion in both cases is
obtained by solving a linear programming problem. A third experiment compares
the delay and travel time using the existing fixed time control and a max
pressure control. The fourth experiment compares two PointQ models: in the
first model the freeway traffic follows a pre-specified route while the
background traffic moves according to turn ratios, and in the second model turn
ratios are modified in a single commodity model to match the link flows. The
substantial modification of the turn ratios needed suggests that the use of a
single-commodity model as frequently done in CTM models can be misleading...

which the interactions have a symmetric form. We find that the corresponding

find that the amplitudes of the ribbon diagrams for the models of this

to any of the models of the whole family of matrix models obtained from the

describe the details of its design with respect to the challenges posed by
modern heterogeneous supercomputers and recent algorithmic developments.
Implementation details which are indispensable for achieving high efficiency

which may cause severe damage to ships and other maritime structures. Despite
years of research, the exact origin of rogue waves is still disputed. Linear
interference of waves with random phase has often been cited as one possible
explanation, but apparently does not satisfactorily explain the probability of
extreme events in the ocean. Other explanations therefore suggested a decisive
role of a nonlinearity in the system. Here we show that linear interference of
a finite and variable number of waves may very well explain the heavy tail in
the wave height distribution. Our model can explain all prototypical ocean
rogue waves reported so far, including the ""three sisters"" as well as rogue
holes. We further suggest nonlinear time series analysis for estimation of the
characteristic number of interfering waves for a given sea state. If ocean
dynamics is ruled by interference of less than ten waves, rogue waves cannot
appear as a matter of principle. In contrast, for larger numbers, their
appearance is much more likely than predicted by parameterless models or
longterm observation. The pronounced threshold behavior of our model enables
effective forecasting of extreme ocean waves.

uncertainties are the amount of mass ejected in the supernova event (if any)
and the magnitude of the natal kick the black hole receives at birth (if any).
Repetto et al. (2012), studying the position of Galactic X-ray binaries
containing black holes, found evidence for black holes receiving high natal
kicks at birth. In this Paper we extend that study, taking into account the
previous binary evolution of the sources as well. The seven short-period
black-hole X-ray binaries that we use, are compact binaries consisting of a
low-mass star orbiting a black hole in a period less than $1$ day. We trace
their binary evolution backwards in time, from the current observed state of
mass-transfer, to the moment the black hole was formed, and we add the extra
information on the kinematics of the binaries. We find that several systems
could be explained by no natal kick, just mass ejection, while for two systems
(and possibly more) a high kick is required. So unless the latter have an
alternative formation, such as within a globular cluster, we conclude that at
least some black holes get high kicks. This challenges the standard picture
that black hole kicks would be scaled down from neutron star kicks.
Furthermore, we find that five systems could have formed with a non-zero natal
kick but zero mass ejected (i.e. no supernova) at formation, as predicted by
neutrino-driven natal kicks.

dip arrival times obtained from observations spanning 25 years, from 1978 to

explained by invoking an extreme, non-conservative mass transfer rate that is
not easily justifiable. We extended the analysed data from 1978 to 2014, by
spanning 37 years, to verify whether a larger sample of data can be fitted with
a quadratic term or a different scenario has to be considered. We obtained 27
delays associated with the dip arrival times from data covering 37 years and
used different models to fit the time delays with respect to a constant period
model.We find that the quadratic form alone does not fit the data. The data are
well fitted using a sinusoidal term plus a quadratic function or,
alternatively, with a series of sinusoidal terms that can be associated with a
modulation of the dip arrival times due to the presence of a third body that
has an elliptical orbit. We infer that for a conservative mass transfer
scenario the modulation of the delays can be explained by invoking the presence
of a third body with mass between 0.10-0.14 M$_{\odot}$, orbital period around
the X-ray binary system of close to 51 yr and an eccentricity of $0.28 \pm
0.15$. In a non-conservative mass transfer scenario we estimate that the
fraction of matter yielded by the degenerate companion star and accreted onto
the neutron star is $\beta = 0.08$, the neutron star mass is $\ge 2.2$

and edges are constructed from top-N recommendations (e.g., related movies). In
particular, we focus on evaluating the reachability and navigability of
recommendation networks and investigate the following questions: (i) How well
do recommendation networks support navigation and exploratory search? (ii) What
is the influence of parameters, in particular different recommendation
algorithms and the number of recommendations shown, on reachability and
navigability? and (iii) How can reachability and navigability be improved in
these networks? We tackle these questions by first evaluating the reachability
of recommendation networks by investigating their structural properties.
Second, we evaluate navigability by simulating three different models of
information seeking scenarios. We find that with standard algorithms,
recommender systems are not well suited to navigation and exploration and
propose methods to modify recommendations to improve this. Our work extends
from one-click-based evaluations of recommender systems towards multi-click
analysis (i.e., sequences of dependent clicks) and presents a general,
comprehensive approach to evaluating navigability of arbitrary recommendation
networks.

  The present work is devoted to the investigation of the end-to-end
performance and power allocation of a maximum-ratio-combining based
regenerative multi-relay cooperative network over non-homogeneous scattering
environment, which is the case in realistic wireless communication scenarios.
Novel analytic expressions are derived for the end-to-end symbol-error-rate of
both $M-$ary Phase-Shift Keying and $M-$ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
over independent and non-identically distributed generalized fading channels.
The offered results are expressed in closed-form involving the Lauricella
function and can be readily evaluated with the aid of a proposed computational
algorithm. Simple expressions are also derived for the corresponding
symbol-error-rate at asymptotically high signal-to-noise ratios. The derived
expressions are corroborated with respective results from computer simulations
and are subsequently employed in formulating a power optimization problem that
enhances the system performance under total power constraints within the
multi-relay cooperative system. Furthermore, it is shown that optimum power
allocation provides substantial performance gains over equal power allocation,
particularly, when the source-relay and relay-destination paths are highly
unbalanced.

which allow several physical processes to be tested, such as the possible
chemical pattern imprinted by the planet formation process. Aims. We explore
the probable chemical signature of planet formation in the remarkable binary
system HD 80606 - HD 80607. The star HD 80606 hosts a giant planet with 4 MJup
detected by both transit and radial velocity techniques, being one of the most
eccentric planets detected to date. We study condensation temperature Tc trends
of volatile and refractory element abundances to determine whether there is a
depletion of refractories that could be related to the terrestrial planet
formation. Methods. We carried out a high-precision abundance determination in
both components of the binary system, using a line-by-line strictly
differential approach, using the Sun as a reference and then using HD 80606 as
reference. We used an updated version of the program FUNDPAR, together with
ATLAS9 model atmospheres and the MOOG code. Conclusions. From the study of Tc
trends, we concluded that the stars HD 80606 and HD 80607 do not seem to be
depleted in refractory elements, which is different for the case of the Sun.
Then, the terrestrial planet formation would have been less efficient in the
components of this binary system than in the Sun. The lack of a trend for
refractory elements with Tc between both stars implies that the presence of a
giant planet do not neccesarily imprint a chemical signature in their host
stars, similar to the recent result of Liu et al. (2014). This is also in
agreement with Melendez et al. (2009), who suggest that the presence of
close-in giant planets might prevent the formation of terrestrial planets.
Finally, we speculate about a possible planet around the star HD 80607.

The energy along the path exhibits two maxima in the energy. The first maximum

corresponds to an extended 60{\deg} dislocation. The subsequent energy maximum
occurs as a second 60{\deg} dislocation nucleates in a complementary, mirror
glide plane, simultaneously starting from the surface and from the first

uplink channel estimation in massive MIMO-OFDM systems with frequency selective
channels. With increased number of antennas, the channel estimation problem
becomes very challenging as exceptionally large number of channel parameters
have to be estimated. We propose an efficient distributed linear minimum mean
square error (LMMSE) algorithm that can achieve near optimal channel estimates
at very low complexity by exploiting the strong spatial correlations and
symmetry of large antenna array elements. The proposed method involves solving
a (fixed) reduced dimensional LMMSE problem at each antenna followed by a
repetitive sharing of information through collaboration among neighboring
antenna elements. To further enhance the channel estimates and/or reduce the
number of reserved pilot tones, we propose a data-aided estimation technique
that relies on finding a set of most reliable data carriers. We also analyse
the effect of pilot contamination on the mean square error (MSE) performance of
different channel estimation techniques. Unlike the conventional approaches, we
use stochastic geometry to obtain analytical expression for interference
variance (or power) across OFDM frequency tones and use it to derive the MSE
expressions for different algorithms under both noise and pilot contaminated
regimes. Simulation results validate our analysis and the near optimal MSE
performance of proposed estimation algorithms.

distinguishable from other edges and thus are easy to be determined. For
instance, when the IT structures for the 2-dimensional (2D) datasets are
graphically presented, those undesired edges can be easily spotted and
interactively determined. However, in practice, there are many datasets that do
not lie in the 2D Euclidean space, thus their IT structures cannot be
graphically presented. But if we can effectively map those IT structures into a
visualized space in which the salient features of those undesired edges are
preserved, then the undesired edges in the IT structures can still be visually
determined in a visualization environment. Previously, this purpose was reached
by our method called IT-map. The outstanding advantage of IT-map is that
clusters can still be found even with the so-called crowding problem in the
embedding.
  In this paper, we propose another method, called IT-Dendrogram, to achieve

single link hierarchical clustering (SLHC) method. Like IT-map, IT-Dendrogram
can also effectively represent the IT structures in a visualization

can serve as another visualization method to determine the undesired edges in

of ultra-intense, short laser pulse through the under-dense plasma. The kinetic
aspects of plasma are fully incorporated using extensive particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations. It is turned out that the plasma behavior is characterized by both
its density and the ratio of the pulse length to the plasma wavelength.
According to exact analyses and direct simulation evidences, at ultra-low
densities the laser pulse is adiabatically depleted (absorbed) by the wake
excitation. And the depletion is accompanied by the overall radiation
red-shift. At these densities, for pulse lengths larger than the plasma
wavelength the Raman type scatterings also occur without causing instability.
When the plasma density grows toward the critical density, a completely new
regime appears with the main character of highly unsteady light propagation.
Here, based on analyses and simulations, the radiation pressure induced wave
breaking (RPIWB) heavily destroys the oscillatory structure of the electron
wave behind the first plasma period. On the other hand, the electron density
profile induced by the ponderomotive force ahead of the pulse begins to steepen
and eventually acts as a flying mirror. As a result, the pulse becomes bake
scattered and its penetration becomes limited. The radiation pressure of
reflecting pulse sustains a longitudinal electric field which accelerates
electrons produced via RPIWB causing the plasma to undergo volumetric heating.
Mostly important, based on a newly proposed model it is shown that the
interaction becomes saturated at a definite time and that the overall
absorption and plasma heating are directly related to this time. Also it is
found that the saturation time decreases by a factor of ( , and are initial
electron density, critical density and initial laser gamma factor)...

response formalism exhibiting a linear-scaling computational complexity with
system size, without relying on the simplifying Tamm-Dancoff approximation
(TDA). The implementation relies on representing the occupied and unoccupied
subspace with two different sets of in situ optimised localised functions,
yielding a very compact and efficient representation of the transition density
matrix of the excitation with the accuracy associated with a systematic basis
set. The TDDFT eigenvalue equation is solved using a preconditioned
conjugate-gradients algorithm that is very memory-efficient. The algorithm is
validated on a test molecule and a good agreement with results obtained from
standard quantum chemistry packages is found, with the preconditioner yielding
a significant improvement in convergence rates. The method developed in this
work is then used to reproduce experimental results of the absorption spectrum
of bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) in an organic solvent, where it is demonstrated
that the TDA fails to reproduce the main features of the low energy spectrum,
while the full TDDFT equation yields results in good qualitative agreement with
experimental data. Furthermore, the need for explicitly including parts of the
solvent into the TDDFT calculations is highlighted, making the treatment of
large system sizes necessary that are well within reach of the capabilities of
the algorithm introduced here. Finally, the linear-scaling properties of the
algorithm are demonstrated by computing the lowest excitation energy of BChl in
solution. The largest systems considered in this work are of the same order of
magnitude as a variety of pigment-protein complexes, opening up the possibility
of studying their properties without having to resort to any semiclassical

characteristics of tsunamis. With the help of the overland-flow
characteristics, the characteristics of the causative tsunami wave can be
estimated. The understanding of tsunami deposits has tremendously improved over
the last decades. There are three prominent inversion models: Moore advection
model, Soulsby's model and TsuSedMod model. TSUFLIND incorporates all three
models and adds new modules to better simulate tsunami deposit formation and
calculate flow condition. TSUFLIND takes grain-size distribution, thickness,
water depth and topography information as inputs. TSUFLIND computes sediment
concentration, grain-size distribution of sediment source and initial flow
condition to match the sediment thickness and grain size distribution from
field observation. Furthermore, TSUFLIND estimates the flow speed, Froude
number and representative wave amplitude. The model is tested by using field
data collected at Ranganathapuram, India after the 2004 India Ocean tsunami.
TSUFLIND reproduces the field measurement grain-size distribution with less
than 5% error. Tsunami speed in this test case is about 4.7 m/s at 150 meters
inland and decreases to 3.3 m/s 350 meters inland from the shoreline. The
estimated wave amplitude of the largest wave for this test case is about 5 to 7
meters.

Our main tool will be a dynamical system defined on the variety of Lie algebras

fact that the possible pointed (or Cheeger-Gromov) limits of solutions, as well

The approach has already been worked out in the Ricci flow case and for general
curvature flows of almost-hermitian structures on Lie groups. This paper is
intended as an attempt to motivate the use of the method on homogeneous spaces

methods are accompanied with three different problems: high computational
complexity (usually associated with the nuclear norm minimization),
non-convexity (for matrix factorization methods) and susceptibility to gross
corruptions in the data. In this paper we propose a principal component
analysis (PCA) based solution that overcomes these three issues and
approximates a low-rank recovery method for high dimensional datasets. We
target the low-rank recovery by enforcing two types of graph smoothness
assumptions, one on the data samples and the other on the features by designing
a convex optimization problem. The resulting algorithm is fast, efficient and
scalable for huge datasets with O(nlog(n)) computational complexity in the
number of data samples. It is also robust to gross corruptions in the dataset
as well as to the model parameters. Clustering experiments on 7 benchmark
datasets with different types of corruptions and background separation

STEREO B position the filaments were visible at the limb. Nearly identical
interaction episode was observed on 2012 August 04 by STEREO A on disc and by
SDO at the limb. This good opportunity allows us to disentangle the 3-D shape
of the connecting flux rope and in particular to determine with high
reliability the helicity sign of the flux rope, which looks ambiguous in
preliminary inspections of on-disc EUV images only.} The complex magnetic
structure of the region consists of three braided flux ropes in the vicinity of

plasma motions within it from two points of view, we determine the negative
sign of helicity of the flux rope, which corresponds to dextral chirality of
the filaments. The observations, despite the tangled fine structure in some EUV

Alon's combinatorial Nullstellensatz. As corollaries of our two bounds, we
obtain bounds on the number of repeated and distinct values of polynomials and
polynomial maps of pairs of points in $\mathbb{C}^2$, with a characterization

leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity in the
presence of depressive and facilitating mechanisms. The dynamics is analyzed by
a Heterogeneous Mean-Field approximation, that allows to keep track of the
effects of structural disorder in the network. We describe the complex behavior
of different classes of excitatory and inhibitory components, that give rise to
a rich dynamical phase-diagram as a function of the fraction of inhibitory
neurons. By the same mean field approach, we study and solve a global inverse
problem: reconstructing the degree probability distributions of the inhibitory

knowledge of the average synaptic activity field. This approach unveils new
perspectives in the numerical study of neural network dynamics and in the
possibility of using these models as testbed for the analysis of experimental

  imaging",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Beamforming in ultrasound imaging has significant impact on the quality of
the final image, controlling its resolution and contrast. Despite its low
spatial resolution and contrast, delay-and-sum is still extensively used
nowadays in clinical applications, due to its real-time capabilities. The most
common alternatives are minimum variance method and its variants, which
overcome the drawbacks of delay-and-sum, at the cost of higher computational
complexity that limits its utilization in real-time applications.
  In this paper, we propose to perform beamforming in ultrasound imaging
through a regularized inverse problem based on a linear model relating the
reflected echoes to the signal to be recovered. Our approach presents two major
advantages: i) its flexibility in the choice of statistical assumptions on the
signal to be beamformed (Laplacian and Gaussian statistics are tested herein)
and ii) its robustness to a reduced number of pulse emissions. The proposed
framework is flexible and allows for choosing the right trade-off between noise
suppression and sharpness of the resulted image. We illustrate the performance
of our approach on both simulated and experimental data, with \textit{in vivo}
examples of carotid and thyroid. Compared to delay-and-sum, minimimum variance
and two other recently published beamforming techniques, our method offers
better spatial resolution, respectively contrast, when using Laplacian and
Gaussian priors.

$J/\psi$ is longitudinal due to large contributions through the $^3P_J^{[8]}$

analysis, we have obtained general solutions proving that there exists an

cost (defined as energy consumption divided by mutual information) per neuron
passes through a global minimum for both subthreshold and superthreshold

increasingly popular. Cellular automata (CAs) support the modeling of systems

physics can be described by starting with a specific Lagrangian, the idea to
derive a cellular automaton directly from the Lagrangian (or similar construct,

the J-PET detection system and to choose the best of available solutions. At
the two strip J-PET test system a series of measurements was performed with
different combinations concerning the length of the lightguides (3 mm and 3 cm)
and scintillators (3, 15 and 30 cm), shape of lightguides (trapezoidal and
cylindrical, with and without a cut matching the scintillator size) and optical
connection between elements (optical gel and glue). It was proven that the
insertion of the thin lightguide does not spoil the time resolution and the
light output. Additionally,the correlation between the time resolution and the
light output was confirmed.

and use it to construct a new diagnostic of explodability. The fundamental
challenge in CCSN theory is to explain how a stalled accretion shock revives to
explode a star. In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is
initiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition
for spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$. One of the most useful
one-dimensional explosion conditions is the neutrino luminosity and
mass-accretion rate ($L_{\nu}-\dot{\mathcal{M}}$) critical curve. Below this
curve, steady-state stalled solutions exist, but above this curve, there are no
stalled solutions. Burrows & Goshy suggested that the solutions above this
curve are dynamic and explosive. In this manuscript, we take one step closer to
proving this supposition; we show that all steady solutions above this curve
have $v_s > 0$. Assuming that these steady $v_s > 0$ solutions correspond to
explosion, we present a new dimensionless integral condition for explosion,
$\Psi > 0$. $\Psi$ roughly describes the balance between pressure and gravity,
and we show that this parameter is equivalent to the $\tau$ condition used to
infer the $L_{\nu}-\dot{\mathcal{M}}$ critical curve. The illuminating
difference is that there is a direct relationship between $\Psi$ and $v_s$.
Below the critical curve, $\Psi$ may be negative, positive, and zero, which
corresponds to receding, expanding, and stalled-shock solutions. At the
critical curve, the minimum $\Psi$ solution is zero; above the critical curve,
$\Psi_{\rm min} > 0$, and all steady solutions have $v_s > 0$. Using
one-dimensional simulations, we confirm our primary assumptions and verify that
$\Psi_{\rm min} > 0$ is a reliable and accurate explosion diagnostic.

peoples tastes can be set so that the algorithm takes over N cuts. There are
three such algorithms known. Which is better?
  We have devised a way to measure the number of cuts even though it is

a novel multiset ordering on types. Our development is done in the Coq proof

contribution to the total assortativity varies with degree, featuring a
distinctive peak slightly past the average degree. The way traditional models
imprint assortativity on top of pre-defined topologies is via degree-preserving
link permutations, which however destroy the particular graph's hierarchical
traits of clustering. Here, we propose the first generative model which creates
heterogeneous networks with scale-free-like properties and tunable realistic
assortativity. In our approach, two distinct populations of nodes are added to
an initial network seed: one (the followers) that abides by usual preferential
rules, and one (the potential leaders) connecting via anti-preferential
attachments, i.e. selecting lower degree nodes for their initial links. The
latter nodes come to develop a higher average degree, and convert eventually
into the final hubs. Examining the evolution of links in Facebook, we present
empirical validation for the connection between the initial anti-preferential
attachment and long term high degree. Thus, our work sheds new light on the
