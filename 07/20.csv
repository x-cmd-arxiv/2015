the ""complexity"" of a set of sets (a.k.a. concept classes). It has been
introduced by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in their seminal 1971 paper and has since
found many applications, most notably in machine learning theory and in
computational geometry. Arguably the most influential consequence of the VC
analysis is the fundamental theorem of statistical machine learning, stating
that a concept class is learnable (in some precise sense) if and only if its
VC-dimension is finite. Furthermore, for such classes a most simple learning
rule - empirical risk minimization (ERM) - is guaranteed to succeed.
  The simplest non-trivial structures, in terms of the VC-dimension, are the
classes (i.e., sets of subsets) for which that dimension is 1.
  In this note we show a couple of curious results concerning such classes. The
first result shows that such classes share a very simple structure, and, as a
corollary, the labeling information contained in any sample labeled by such a
class can be compressed into a single instance.
  The second result shows that due to some subtle measurability issues, in
spite of the above mentioned fundamental theorem, there are classes of
dimension 1 for which an ERM learning rule fails miserably.

dynamics can induce, in a completely objective deterministic way, the
appearance of periodically exploding bubbles ending in crashes. Technically,
the periodically explosive bubbles arise due to the proximity of two types of
bifurcations as a function of the two key control parameters $b$ and $g$, which
represent, respectively, the sensitivity of the fundamental asset price on past
asset and bond prices and of the fundamental bond price on past asset prices.
One is a Hopf bifurcation, when a stable focus transforms into an unstable
focus and a limit cycle appears. The other is a rather unusual bifurcation,
when a stable node and a saddle merge together and disappear, while an unstable
focus survives and a limit cycle develops. The lines, where the periodic
bubbles arise, are analogous to the critical lines of phase transitions in
statistical physics. The amplitude of bubbles and waiting times between them
respectively diverge with the critical exponents $\gamma = 1$ and $\nu = 1/2$,
as the critical lines are approached.

geophysics observation, and to measure the general relativistic Lense-Thirring
effect, has been observed to undergo an anomalous along-track orbital
acceleration of -0.4 pm/s$^2$ (pm := picometer). This ""drag"" is not surprising;
along track drag has previously been observed with the related LAGEOS
satellites (-3.4 pm/s$^2$). It is hypothesized that the drag is principally due
to anisotropic thermal radiation from the satellite's exterior. We report the
results of numerical computations of the along-track orbital decay of the LARES
satellite during the first 126 days after launch. The results depend to a
significant degree on the visual and IR absorbance $\alpha$ and emissivity
$\epsilon$ of the fused silica Cube Corner Reflectors. We present results for
two values of $\alpha_{IR}$ = $\epsilon_{IR}$: 0.82, a standard number for
""clean"" fused silica; and 0.60, a possible value for silica with slight surface
contamination subjected to the space environment. The heating and the resultant
along-track acceleration depend on the plane of the orbit, the sun position,
and in particular on the occurrence of eclipses, all of which are functions of
time. Thus we compute the drag for specific days. We compare our model to
observational data, available for a 120-day period starting with the 7th day
after launch, which shows the average acceleration of -0.4 pm/s$^2$. With our
model the average along-track drag over this 120-day period for CCR
$\alpha_{IR}$ = $\epsilon_{IR}$ = 0.82 was computed to be -0.59 pm/s$^2$. For
CCR $\alpha_{IR}$ = $\epsilon_{IR}$ = 0.60 we compute -0.36 pm/s$^2$. Thus, our
model demonstrates that most of the anomalous along-track acceleration can be
explained by thermal thrust, but there could be smaller contributions from
unmodelled effects.

exponential, different from polynomial rates we often see in statistical
literature. An immediate consequence of the result is to establish threshold
phenomenon for strong consistency (exact recovery) as well as weak consistency
(partial recovery). We obtain the upper bound by a range of penalized
likelihood-type approaches. The lower bound is achieved by a novel reduction
from a global mis-match ratio to a local clustering problem for one node
through an exchangeability property.

polytope in the Bloch body. In the Bloch body picture SIMs and full sets of
MUMs form highly symmetric polytopes (a single regular simplex in the one case;
the convex hull of a set of orthogonal regular simplices in the other). We give
the necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary polytope to be what we
call a homogeneous conical 2-design. This suggests a way to search for new
kinds of projective 2-design.

in the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS) using high
precision numerical simulations. In our universe, short distance non-linear
perturbations, not under perturbative control, affect long distance
fluctuations through an effective stress tensor that needs to be parametrized
in terms of counterterms that are functions of the long distance fluctuating
fields. We find that at two-loop order it is necessary to include three
counterterms: a linear term in the over density, $\delta$, a quadratic term,
$\delta^2$, and a higher derivative term, $\partial^2\delta$. After the
inclusion of these three terms, the EFTofLSS at two-loop order matches
simulation data up to $k\simeq 0.34 \,h\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshift $z=0$, up
to $k\simeq 0.55\,h\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=1$, and up to $k\simeq 1.1\,h\,
{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=2$. At these wavenumbers, the cosmic variance of the
simulation is at least as small as $10^{-3}$, providing a high precision
comparison between theory and data. The actual reach of the theory is affected
by theoretical uncertainties associated to not having included higher order
terms in perturbation theory, for which we provide an estimate, and by
potentially overfitting the data, which we also try to address. Since in the
EFTofLSS the coupling constants associated with the counterterms are unknown
functions of time, we show how a simple parametrization gives a sensible
description of their time-dependence. Overall, the $k$-reach of the EFTofLSS is
much larger than previous analytical techniques, showing that the amount of
cosmological information amenable to high-precision analytical control might be
much larger than previously believed.

$\mathbb{F}_q$. Whereas properties such as rank, connectivity, and circuit size
have been well-studied, forbidden minors have not yet been analyzed. Here, we
investigate the asymptotic probability as $n \to \infty$ that a fixed
$\mathbb{F}_q$-representable matroid $M$ is a minor of $M[A_n]$. (We always
assume $m(n) \geq \text{rank}(M)$ for all sufficiently large $n$, otherwise $M$
can never be a minor of the corresponding $M[A_n]$.) When $M$ is free, we show
that $M$ is asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) a minor of $M[A_n]$. When $M$
is not free, we show a phase transition: $M$ is a.a.s. a minor if $n - m(n) \to
\infty$, but is a.a.s. not if $m(n) - n \to \infty$. In the more general
settings of $m \leq n$ and $m > n$, we give lower and upper bounds,
respectively, on both the asymptotic and non-asymptotic probability that $M$ is
a minor of $M[A_n]$. The tools we develop to analyze matroid operations and
minors of random matroids may be of independent interest.
  Our results directly imply that $M[A_n]$ is a.a.s. not contained in any
proper, minor-closed class $\mathcal{M}$ of $\mathbb{F}_q$-representable
matroids, provided: (i) $n - m(n) \to \infty$, and (ii) $m(n)$ is at least the
minimum rank of any $\mathbb{F}_q$-representable forbidden minor of
$\mathcal{M}$, for all sufficiently large $n$. As an application, this shows
that graphic matroids are a vanishing subset of linear matroids, in a sense
made precise in the paper. Our results provide an approach for applying the
rich theory around matroid minors to the less-studied field of random matroids.

regular or randomised - is an important factor in determining the impact of a
systematic effect: a purely randomised survey strategy produces the smallest
biases, at the expense of larger parameter uncertainties, and a very
regularised survey strategy produces large biases, but unaffected
uncertainties. However, by removing, or modelling, the affected scales
(l-modes) in the regular cases the biases are reduced to negligible levels. We
find that the integral of the systematic power spectrum is not a good metric
for dark energy performance, and we advocate that systematic effects should be
modelled accurately in real space, where they enter the measurement process,
and their effect subsequently propagated into power spectrum contributions.

stability of an ecosystem and its biodiversity is still not well understood.
The ability of ecological communities to recover after a small perturbation of
the species abundances (local asymptotic stability) has been well studied,
whereas the likelihood of a community to persist when the interactions are
altered (structural stability) has received much less attention. Our goal is to
understand the effects of diversity, interaction strenghts and ecological
network structure on the volume of parameter space leading to feasible
equilibria, i.e., ones in which all populations have positive abundances. We
develop a geometrical framework to study the range of conditions necessary for
feasible coexistence in both mutualistic and consumer-resource systems. Using
analytical and numerical methods, we show that feasibility is determined by
just a handful of quantities describing the interactions, yielding a nontrivial
complexity-feasibility relationship. Analyzing more than 100 empirical
networks, we show that the range of coexistence conditions in mutualistic
systems can be analytically predicted by means of a null model of random
interactions, whereas food webs are characterized by smaller coexistence
domains than those expected by chance. Finally, we characterize the geometric
shape of the feasibility domain, thereby identifying the direction of
perturbations that are more likely to cause extinctions. Interestingly, the
structure of mutualistic interactions leads to very heterogeneous responses to
perturbations, making those systems more fragile than expected by chance.

spectral distribution was shown by Xiuyuan Cheng and Amit Singer to converge to

interpretation of this limit measure as the additive free convolution of a

this random matrix to those of a deformed GUE matrix with the same limiting

study is motivated by the analysis of a covariance thresholding procedure for
the statistical detection and estimation of sparse principal components, and
our results characterize the limit of the largest eigenvalue of the thresholded

the need to rethink our curriculum from the ground up, and offers five
principles and two caveats intended to help us along the path toward a new
synthesis. These principles and caveats rest on my sense of three parallel
evolutions: the convergence of trends in the roles of mathematics, computation,

the articles cited above and the seminal provocation by Leo Breiman (2001) call
for a deep rethinking of what we teach to undergraduates. In particular,

fundamental concepts accessible and to minimize prerequisites to research.

different complexities, is considered. A new cascade design procedure is
introduced, by formulating cascade learning as the Lagrangian optimization of a
risk that accounts for both accuracy and complexity. A boosting algorithm,
denoted as complexity aware cascade training (CompACT), is then derived to
solve this optimization. CompACT cascades are shown to seek an optimal
trade-off between accuracy and complexity by pushing features of higher
complexity to the later cascade stages, where only a few difficult candidate
patches remain to be classified. This enables the use of features of vastly
different complexities in a single detector. In result, the feature pool can be
expanded to features previously impractical for cascade design, such as the
responses of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). This is demonstrated
through the design of a pedestrian detector with a pool of features whose
complexities span orders of magnitude. The resulting cascade generalizes the
combination of a CNN with an object proposal mechanism: rather than a
pre-processing stage, CompACT cascades seamlessly integrate CNNs in their
stages. This enables state of the art performance on the Caltech and KITTI
datasets, at fairly fast speeds.

performance of single-antenna multi-carrier communication systems, suffering
from in-phase and quadrature (I/Q)-imbalance (IQI) at the receiver. We refer to
the proposed scheme as I/Q-imbalance self-interference coordination (IQSC).
IQSC does not only mitigate the detrimental effects of IQI, but, through
appropriate signal processing, also coordinates the self-interference terms
produced by IQI in order to achieve second-order frequency diversity. However,
these benefits come at the expense of a reduction in transmission rate. More
specifically, IQSC is a simple transmit diversity scheme that improves the
signal quality at the receiver by elementary signal processing operations
across symmetric (mirror) pairs of subcarriers. Thereby, the proposed
transmission protocol has a similar complexity as Alamouti's space-time block
coding scheme and does not require extra transmit power nor any feedback. To
evaluate the performance of IQSC, we derive closed-form expressions for the
resulting outage probability and symbol error rate. Interestingly, IQSC
outperforms not only existing IQI compensation schemes but also the ideal
system without IQI for the same spectral efficiency and practical target error
rates, while it achieves almost the same performance as ideal (i.e., IQI-free)
equal-rate repetition coding. Our findings reveal that IQSC is a promising
low-complexity technique for significantly increasing the reliability of
low-cost devices that suffer from high levels of IQI.

promising method for inferring the growth function of large scale structure.
This analysis will be carried out on data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES),
with its measurements of both the distribution of galaxies and the tangential
shears of background galaxies induced by these foreground lenses. We develop a
practical approach to modeling the assumptions and systematic effects affecting
small scale lensing, which provides halo masses, and large scale galaxy
clustering. Introducing parameters that characterize the halo occupation
distribution (HOD), photometric redshift uncertainties, and shear measurement
errors, we study how external priors on different subsets of these parameters
affect our growth constraints. Degeneracies within the HOD model, as well as
between the HOD and the growth function, are identified as the dominant source
of complication, with other systematic effects sub-dominant. The impact of HOD
parameters and their degeneracies necessitate the detailed joint modeling of
the galaxy sample that we employ. We conclude that DES data will provide
powerful constraints on the evolution of structure growth in the universe,
conservatively/optimistically constraining the growth function to 7.9\%/4.8\%
with its first-year data that covered over 1000 square degrees, and to
3.9\%/2.3\% with its full five-year data that will survey 5000 square degrees,

medium is studied at high resolution using \emph{in situ} imaging, coupled with
particle tracking. The deformation configuration is indentation by a flat punch
under macroscopic plane-strain conditions. Using a general analysis method,
velocity gradients and deformation fields are obtained from the disordered
grain arrangement, enabling flow characteristics to be quantified. The key
observations are the formation of a stagnation zone, as in dilute granular flow
past obstacles; occurrence of vortices in the flow immediately underneath the
punch; and formation of distinct shear bands adjoining the stagnation zone. The
transient and steady state stagnation zone geometry, as well as the strength of
the vortices and strain rates in the shear bands, are obtained from the
experimental data. All of these results are well-reproduced in exact-scale
Non-Smooth Contact Dynamics (NSCD) simulations. Full 3D numerical particle
positions from the simulations allow extraction of flow features that are
extremely difficult to obtain from experiments. Three examples of these, namely
material free surface evolution, deformation of a grain column below the punch
and resolution of velocities inside the primary shear band, are highlighted.
The variety of flow features observed in this model problem also illustrates
the difficulty involved in formulating a complete micromechanical analytical
description of the deformation.

characterized. We find that KMT-2015-1b is a giant planet orbiting a low-mass
M-dwarf host star. The planet has a mass about twice that of Jupiter and it is
located beyond the snow line of the host star. With the improvement of existing
surveys and the advent of new surveys, future microlensing planet samples will
include planets not only in greatly increased number but also in a wide

simultaneously detects the common channel taps of dynamic sparse channels in
all time slots at first, and then tracks the dynamic channel taps in each
single time slot individually. Theoretical analysis of the proposed SMP

signals from dimensionality reducing, non-adaptive sensing mechanisms. Sparsity
is also used to enhance interpretability in machine learning and statistics
applications: While the ambient dimension is vast in modern data analysis
problems, the relevant information therein typically resides in a much lower
dimensional space. However, many solutions proposed nowadays do not leverage
the true underlying structure. Recent results in CS extend the simple sparsity
idea to more sophisticated {\em structured} sparsity models, which describe the
interdependency between the nonzero components of a signal, allowing to
increase the interpretability of the results and lead to better recovery
performance. In order to better understand the impact of structured sparsity,
in this chapter we analyze the connections between the discrete models and
their convex relaxations, highlighting their relative advantages. We start with
the general group sparse model and then elaborate on two important special
cases: the dispersive and the hierarchical models. For each, we present the
models in their discrete nature, discuss how to solve the ensuing discrete
problems and then describe convex relaxations. We also consider more general
structures as defined by set functions and present their convex proxies.
Further, we discuss efficient optimization solutions for structured sparsity
problems and illustrate structured sparsity in action via three applications.

of the principal regulatory structures of the interphase chromatin, namely
topologically-associating domains (TADs) and specific sub-TAD structures termed
super-enhancer domains (SEDs) revealed that 0.8%-10.3% of TADs contain more
than half of HSGRL. Of the 3,127 TADs in the hESC genome, 24 (0.8%); 53 (1.7%);
259 (8.3%); and 322 (10.3%) harbor 1,110 (52.4%); 1,936 (50.9%); 1,151 (59.6%);
and 1,601 (58.3%) HSGRL sequences from four distinct families, respectively.
TADs that are enriched for HSGRL and termed rapidly-evolving in humans TADs
(revTADs) manifest distinct correlation patterns between HSGRL placements and
recombination rates. There are significant enrichment within revTAD boundaries
of hESC-enhancers, primate-specific CTCF-binding sites, human-specific
RNAPII-binding sites, hCONDELs, and H3K4me3 peaks with human-specific
enrichment at TSS in prefrontal cortex neurons (p < 0.0001 in all instances).
In hESC genome, 331 of 504 (66%) of SE-harboring TADs contain HSGRL and 68% of
SEs co-localize with HSGRL, suggesting that HSGRL rewired SE-driven GRNs within
revTADs by inserting novel and/or erasing existing regulatory sequences.
Consequently, markedly distinct features of chromatin structures evolved in
hESC compared to mouse: the SE quantity is 3-fold higher and the median SE size
is significantly larger; concomitantly, the TAD number is increased by 42%
while the median TAD size is decreased (p=9.11E-37). Present analyses revealed
a global role for HSGRL in increasing both quantity and size of SEs and
increasing the number and size reduction of TADs, which may facilitate a
convergence of TAD and SED architectures of interphase chromatin and define a
trend of increasing regulatory complexity during evolution of GRNs.

hemisphere. The SXI front shows an initially constant speed of 730 km s$^{-1}$
and decelerates later on, and its center is near the central position angle of
the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) but away from flare site.
Chromospheric signatures of the disturbances are observed in both MLSO/PICS
H$\alpha$ and MLSO/CHIP He I 10830 {\AA}, and can be divided into two parts.
The southern signatures occur in regions where the SXI front sweeps over, with
the H$\alpha$ bright front coincident with the SXI front while the He I dark
front lagging the SXI front but showing a similar kinematics. Ahead of the path
of the southern signatures, oscillations of a filament are observed. The
northern signatures occur near the equator, with the H$\alpha$ and He I fronts
coincident with each other. They first propagate westward, and then deflect to
the north at the boundary of an equatorial coronal hole (CH). Based on these
observational facts, we suggest that the global disturbances are associated
with the CME lift-off, and show a hybrid nature: a mainly non-wave CME flank
nature for the SXI signatures and the corresponding southern chromospheric
signatures, and a shocked fast-mode coronal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) wave
nature for the northern chromospheric signatures.

  In the present paper we first study Fisher type lower bounds for the sizes of
spherical designs of harmonic index $t$ (or for harmonic index $T$). We also
study 'tight' spherical designs of harmonic index $t$ or index $T$. Here
'tight' means that the size of $Y$ attains the lower bound for this Fisher type

consists of a reverse shock (RS) and forward shock (FS) separated by a contact

the RS transition region due to the presence of an ambipolar electric field and
reflection by the strong transverse magnetic fields in the shocked region. In a
process similar to shock surfing acceleration (SSA) for ions, electrons
experience drift motion and acceleration by ion filament transverse electric
fields in the plane perpendicular to the shock propagation direction.

method is to use covariant field strengths to be the electric and magnetic
fields. We find an invariant form of an equation of motion after performing the
electric-magnetic duality. The second method is to use the Seiberg-Witten map
to rewrite the non-commutative $U(1)$ gauge theory in terms of abelian field
strength. The third method is to use the large Neveu Schwarz-Neveu Schwarz
(NS-NS) background limit (non-commutativity parameter only has one degree of
freedom) to consider the non-commutative $U(1)$ gauge theory or D3-brane. In
this limit, we introduce or dualize a new one-form gauge potential to get a
D3-brane in a large Ramond-Ramond (R-R) background via field redefinition. We

different physical implications. The comparison reflects the differences

the center of supernova remnants (SNRs). They show high thermal X-ray
luminosities but no radio emission. Spin-down rate measurements of the three
CCOs with X-ray pulsations indicate surface dipole fields much weaker than
those of typical young pulsars. To investigate if CCOs and known radio pulsars
are objects at different evolutionary stages, we carried out a census of all
weak-field (<1e11 G) isolated radio pulsars in the Galactic plane to search for
CCO-like X-ray emission. None of the 12 candidates is detected at X-ray
energies, with luminosity limits of 1e32-1e34 erg/s. We consider a scenario in
which the weak surface fields of CCOs are due to rapid accretion of supernova
materials and show that as the buried field diffuses back to the surface, a CCO
descendant is expected to leave the P-Pdot parameter space of our candidates at
a young age of a few times 10kyr. Hence, the candidates are likely to be just
old ordinary pulsars in this case. We suggest that further searches for
orphaned CCO, which are aged CCOs with parent SNRs dissipated, should include
pulsars with stronger magnetic fields.

interactions among $f$ electrons, spin-orbit coupling $\lambda$, and
crystalline electric field (CEF) potentials, while we consider the
hybridization $V$ between local $f$ electrons and single-band conduction
electrons with $a_{\rm u}$ symmetry. For $\lambda=0$, we observe the
underscreening Kondo behavior for appropriate values of $V$, characterized by
the entropy change from $\ln 8$ to $\ln 7$, in which one of seven $f$ electrons
is screened by conduction electrons. When $\lambda$ is increased, we obtain two
types of behavior depending on the values of $V$. For large $V$, we find the
entropy release of $\ln 7$ at low temperatures, determined by the level
splitting energy due to the hybridization. For small $V$, we also observe the
entropy change from $\ln 8$ to $\ln 2$ by the level splitting due to the
hybridization, but at low temperatures, $\ln 2$ entropy is found to be
released, leading to the Kondo effect. We emphasize that the Kondo behavior for
small $V$ is observed for realistic values of $\lambda$ in the order of $0.1$
eV. We also discuss the effect of CEF potentials and the multipole properties
in the Kondo behavior found in this paper.

demonstrate a low-temperature, dry process capable of transfer-printing a

graphene layer on a hydrophobic stamp made of poly(dimethylsiloxane), which is
overcome by introducing two crucial modifications to the conventional

decrease in surface tension of the liquid bath. Using this technique, patterns
of a graphene monolayer were transfer-printed on

are easily degraded when exposed to an aqueous or aggressive patterning

requirements. The inputs required are the current and future Through-the-Cycle
PDs of the obligors, their last known default rates, and a measurement of the
systematic dependence of the obligors. Technically, the forecasts are made from
within a classical asset-based credit portfolio model, with the additional
assumption of a simple (first/second order) autoregressive process for the
systematic factor. This paper elaborates in detail on the practical issues of
implementation, especially on the parametrization alternatives. We also show
how the approach can be naturally extended to low-default portfolios with
volatile default rates, using Bayesian methodology. Furthermore, expert
judgments on the current macroeconomic state, although not necessary for the
forecasts, can be embedded into the model using the Bayesian technique. The
resulting PD forecasts can be used for the derivation of expected lifetime
credit losses as required by the newly adopted accounting standard IFRS 9. In
doing so, the presented approach is endogenous, as it does not require any
exogenous macroeconomic forecasts, which are notoriously unreliable and often
subjective. Also, it does not require any dependency modeling between PDs and
macroeconomic variables, which often proves to be cumbersome and unstable.

Modern Maximum, and quite abrupt drops that are denoted as Grand Minima. Direct
numerical simulations (DNS) of convection driven dynamos offer one way of
examining the mechanisms behind these events. In this work, we analyze a
solution of a solar-like DNS that has been evolved for roughly 80 magnetic
cycles of 4.9 years, during which epochs of irregular behavior are detected.
The emphasis of our analysis is to find physical causes for such behavior. The
DNS employed is a semi-global (wedge) magnetoconvection model. For data
analysis we use Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and phase
dispersion ($D^2$) methods. A special property of the DNS is the existence of
multiple dynamo modes at different depths and latitudes. The dominant mode is
solar-like. This mode is accompanied by a higher frequency mode near the
surface and a low-frequency mode in the bottom of the convection zone. The
overall behavior of the dynamo solution is very complex exhibiting variable
cycle lengths, epochs of disturbed and even ceased surface activity, and strong
short-term hemispherical asymmetries. Surprisingly, the most prominent
suppressed surface activity epoch is actually a global magnetic energy maximum.
We interpret the overall irregular behavior to be due to the interplay of the
different dynamo modes showing different equatorial symmetries, especially the
smoother part of the irregular variations being related to the variations of
the mode strengths, evolving with different and variable cycle lengths. The
abrupt low activity epoch in the dominant dynamo mode near the surface is
related to a strong maximum of the bottom toroidal field strength, which causes
abrupt disturbances especially in the differential rotation profile via the
suppression of the Reynolds stresses.

properties from metal-poor to metal-rich environments by linking them to

Galaxy Survey (DGS) and KINGFISH, totalling 109 galaxies, spanning almost 2 dex
in metallicity. We collect infrared (IR) to submillimetre (submm) data for both
samples and present the complete data set for the DGS sample. We model the
observed spectral energy distributions (SED) with a physically-motivated dust
model to access the dust properties. Using a different SED model (modified
blackbody), dust composition (amorphous carbon), or wavelength coverage at
submm wavelengths results in differences in the dust mass estimate of a factor
two to three, showing that this parameter is subject to non-negligible
systematic modelling uncertainties. For eight galaxies in our sample, we find a
rather small excess at 500 microns (< 1.5 sigma). We find that the dust SED of
low-metallicity galaxies is broader and peaks at shorter wavelengths compared
to more metal-rich systems, a sign of a clumpier medium in dwarf galaxies. The
PAH mass fraction and the dust temperature distribution are found to be driven
mostly by the specific star-formation rate, SSFR, with secondary effects from
metallicity. The correlations between metallicity and dust mass or total-IR
luminosity are direct consequences of the stellar mass-metallicity relation.
The dust-to-stellar mass ratios of metal-rich sources follow the well-studied
trend of decreasing ratio for decreasing SSFR. The relation is more complex for
highly star-forming low-metallicity galaxies and depends on the chemical
evolutionary stage of the source (i.e., gas-to-dust mass ratio). Dust growth
processes in the ISM play a key role in the dust mass build-up with respect to
the stellar content at high SSFR and low metallicity. (abridged)

identification of the physical processes behind such variations is needed for
developing and improving physics-based models of solar brightness variability
and reconstructing solar brightness in the past. This is, in turn, important
for better understanding the solar-terrestrial and solar-stellar connections.
  We estimate the relative contributions of the continuum, molecular, and
atomic lines to the solar brightness variations on different timescales.
  Our approach is based on the assumption that variability of the solar
brightness on timescales greater than a day is driven by the evolution of the
solar surface magnetic field. We calculated the solar brightness variations
employing the solar disc area coverage of magnetic features deduced from the
MDI/SOHO observations. The brightness contrasts of magnetic features relative
to the quiet Sun were calculated with a non-LTE radiative transfer code as
functions of disc position and wavelength. By consecutive elimination of
molecular and atomic lines from the radiative transfer calculations, we
assessed the role of these lines in producing solar brightness variability.
  We show that the variations in Fraunhofer lines define the amplitude of the
solar brightness variability on timescales greater than a day and even the
phase of the total solar irradiance variability over the 11-year cycle. We also
demonstrate that molecular lines make substantial contribution to solar
brightness variability on the 11-year activity cycle and centennial timescales.
In particular, our model indicates that roughly a quarter of the total solar
irradiance variability over the 11-year cycle originates in molecular lines.
The maximum of the absolute spectral brightness variability on timescales
greater than a day is associated with the CN violet system between 380 and 390
nm.

sparse in nature, path delays of different transmit-receive antenna pairs share
a common sparse pattern due to the spatial correlation of MIMO channels.

simultaneously exploiting those MIMO channel characteristics, the proposed

$p(x)$, what is the probability that the maximum value of the set
$X_{\mathrm{max}}=\max_i X_i$ is ""atypically larger"" than expected? The cases

the right rate function for a general pdf in the Gumbel basin of attraction is
derived. The Gaussian case convincingly demonstrates that the full rate

are minor for the weak lines in the visible spectral range, with |$\Delta_{\rm

late-type stars with well-determined stellar parameters that cover the $-2.56

birth distribution of periods and magnetic fields of the pulsar population.
When this method is applied to populations in different wavelengths, it can
break the degeneracy in the inferred properties of initial distributions that
arises from single-band studies. In this context, we extend previous works to
include $X$-ray thermal emitting pulsars within the same evolutionary model as
radio-pulsars. We find that the cumulative distribution of the number of X-ray
pulsars can be well reproduced by several models that, simultaneously,
reproduce the characteristics of the radio-pulsar distribution. However, even
considering the most favourable magneto-thermal evolution models with fast
field decay, log-normal distributions of the initial magnetic field
over-predict the number of visible sources with periods longer than 12 s. We
then show that the problem can be solved with different distributions of
magnetic field, such as a truncated log-normal distribution, or a binormal
distribution with two distinct populations. We use the observational lack of
isolated NSs with spin periods P>12 s to establish an upper limit to the
fraction of magnetars born with B > 10^{15} G (less than 1\%). As future
detections keep increasing the magnetar and high-B pulsar statistics, our
approach can be used to establish a severe constraint on the maximum magnetic

extremely important in a range of machine learning task, not least of all with
regards to classification and clustering. While there exist many feature
extraction techniques suitable for non-intermittent time-series data, these
approaches are not always appropriate for intermittent time-series data, where
intermittency is characterized by constant values for large periods of time
punctuated by sharp and transient increases or decreases in value.
  Motivated by this, we present aggregation, mode decomposition and projection
(AMP) a feature extraction technique particularly suited to intermittent
time-series data which contain time-frequency patterns. For our method all
individual time-series within a set are combined to form a non-intermittent
aggregate. This is decomposed into a set of components which represent the
intrinsic time-frequency signals within the data set. Individual time-series
can then be fit to these components to obtain a set of numerical features that
represent their intrinsic time-frequency patterns. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of AMP, we evaluate against the real word task of clustering
intermittent time-series data. Using synthetically generated data we show that
a clustering approach which uses the features derived from AMP significantly
outperforms traditional clustering methods. Our technique is further
exemplified on a real world data set where AMP can be used to discover
groupings of individuals which correspond to real world sub-populations.

census and openly-available online multi-modal transport data, we are able to
characterise the connectivity of geometrically and topologically complex

one to quantify and assess the impact of transport developments, population
growth, and other infrastructure and demographic changes on a city. Supported
by validations of GDP and HIV infection rates across United States metropolitan
areas, we illustrate the effect of changes in local and city-wide
connectivities by considering the economic impact of two contemporary inter-

lateral platelet quantization. Our results suggest that the PL decay of CdSe
platelets is governed by an LO-phonon bottleneck, related to the reported low
exciton phonon coupling in CdSe platelets and only observable due to the very
large oscillator strength and energy spacing of both states.

problem can be further complicated when multiple BoT applications need to be
executed. In this paper, we propose and implement a heuristic algorithm that
schedules tasks of multiple applications onto different cloud virtual machines
in order to maximise performance while satisfying a given budget constraint.
Current approaches are limited in task scheduling since they place a limit on
the number of cloud resources that can be employed by the applications.
However, in the proposed algorithm there are no such limits, and in comparison
with other approaches, the algorithm on average achieves an improved
performance of 10%. The experimental results also highlight that the algorithm
yields consistent performance even with low budget constraints which cannot be
achieved by competing approaches.

albedo -- of the extreme Centaur 2013 AZ60. These properties have been derived
from optical and thermal infrared measurements. Our optical measurements
revealed a likely full period of ~9.4 h with a shallow amplitude of 4.5%. By
combining optical brightness information and thermal emission data, we are able
to derive a diameter of 62.3 +/- 5.3 km and a geometric albedo of 2.9% --
corresponding to an extremely dark surface. Additionally, our finding of ~> 50
Jm^{-2}K^{-1}s^{-1/2} for the thermal inertia is also noticeably for objects in
such a distance. The results of dynamical simulations yield an unstable orbit,
with a 50% probability that the target will be ejected from the Solar System
within 700,000 years. The current orbit of this object as well as its
instability could imply a pristine cometary surface. This possibility is in
agreement with the observed low geometric albedo and red photometric colour
indices for the object, which are a good match for the surface of a dormant
comet -- as would be expected for a long-period cometary body approaching
perihelion. Despite the fact it was approaching ever closer to the Sun,
however, the object exhibited star-like profiles in each of our observations,
lacking any sign of cometary activity. By the albedo, 2013 AZ60 is a candidate
for the darkest body among the known TNOs.

of using 2.223 MeV gammas (or 1.201 MeV, DE) originating in the
1H(n,gamma)2D-reaction instead of using traditional thermal neutron counting.
Results of investigations presented in this paper indicate that gammas from
thermal neutron capture reaction preserve the information about the correlation
characteristics of thermal (fast) neutrons in the same time scale. Therefore,
instead of thermal neutron detectors (or as a complement) one may use
traditional and inexpensive gamma detectors, such NaI, BGO, CdZnTe or any other
gamma detectors. In this work we used D8x8 cm2 NaI scintillator to test the
concept. Thus, the new approach helps to address the problem of replacement of
3He-counters and problems related to the specific measurements of spent nuclear
fuel directly in the spent fuel pool. It has a particular importance for
nuclear safeguards and security. Overall, this work represents the proof of
concept study and reports on the experimental and numerical evidence that
thermal neutron capture gammas may be used in the context of correlation and
multiplicity measurements. Investigations were performed for a 252Cf-correlated

well, and will be tested experimentally in a future work.

sparse point cloud representing the map of the scene becomes available

state-of-the-art algorithms build a manifold rough model of the scene. These
algorithms integrate incrementally new points to the 3D reconstruction only if
their position estimate does not change. Indeed, whenever a point moves in a 3D

of tetrahedra have to be removed and replaced with new ones to maintain the
Delaunay property; the management of the manifold reconstruction becomes thus
complex and it entails a potentially big overhead. In this paper we investigate
different approaches and we propose an efficient policy to deal with moving

been developed for both efficient and effective community detection. Among
them, the most efficient algorithm is the label propagation algorithm whose
computational complexity is O(|E|). Although it is linear in the number of

observed signals, which are assumed to be generated via a linear model with a
common underlying dictionary. In particular, we derive lower bounds on the
minimum achievable worst case mean squared error (MSE), regardless of
computational complexity of the dictionary learning (DL) schemes. By casting DL
as a classical (or frequentist) estimation problem, the lower bounds on the
worst case MSE are derived by following an established information-theoretic
approach to minimax estimation. The main conceptual contribution of this paper
is the adaption of the information-theoretic approach to minimax estimation for
the DL problem in order to derive lower bounds on the worst case MSE of any DL
scheme. We derive three different lower bounds applying to different generative
models for the observed signals. The first bound applies to a wide range of
models, it only requires the existence of a covariance matrix of the (unknown)
underlying coefficient vector. By specializing this bound to the case of sparse
coefficient distributions, and assuming the true dictionary satisfies the
restricted isometry property, we obtain a lower bound on the worst case MSE of
DL schemes in terms of a signal to noise ratio (SNR). The third bound applies
to a more restrictive subclass of coefficient distributions by requiring the
non-zero coefficients to be Gaussian. While, compared with the previous two
bounds, the applicability of this final bound is the most limited it is the
tightest of the three bounds in the low SNR regime.

highly oscillatory in both physical and stochastic spaces, we provide
theoretical arguments and numerical evidence that quantities of interest based

denote a caching node that has lost parts of its stored packets as a sick
caching node and a caching node that has not lost any packet as a healthy
caching node. In partial repair, a set of caching nodes (among sick and healthy
caching nodes) broadcast information to other sick caching nodes to recover the
erased packets. The broadcast information from a caching node is assumed to be
received without any error by all other caching nodes. All the sick caching
nodes then are able to recover their erased packets, while using the broadcast
information and the nonerased packets in their storage as side information. In
this setting, if an eavesdropper overhears the broadcast channels, it might
obtain some information about the stored file. We thus study secure partial
repair in the senses of information-theoretically strong and weak security. In
both senses, we investigate the secrecy caching capacity, namely, the maximum
amount of information which can be stored in the caching network such that
there is no leakage of information during a partial repair process. We then
deduce the strong and weak secrecy caching capacities, and also derive the
sufficient finite field sizes for achieving the capacities. Finally, we propose
optimal secure codes for exact partial repair, in which the recovered packets

indirect inference. The main idea is to first fit an auxiliary model to the
observed data and then in a second step, often by simulation, fit a more
structured model to the estimated auxiliary model. This two-step procedure can
be used when the direct maximum-likelihood estimate is difficult or intractable
to compute. One such example is the identification of stochastic Wiener
systems, i.e.,~linear dynamic systems with process noise where the output is
measured using a non-linear sensor with additive measurement noise. It is in
principle possible to evaluate the log-likelihood cost function using numerical
integration, but the corresponding optimization problem can be quite intricate.
This motivates studying consistent, but sub-optimal, identification methods for
stochastic Wiener systems. We will consider indirect inference using the best
linear approximation as an auxiliary model. We show that the key to obtain a
reliable estimate is to use uncertainty weighting when fitting the stochastic
Wiener model to the auxiliary model estimate. The main technical contribution
of this paper is the corresponding asymptotic variance analysis. A numerical
evaluation is presented based on a first-order finite impulse response system
with a cubic non-linearity, for which certain illustrative analytic properties
are derived.

critical relaxation exponent $\beta/(\nu z)$ is in good agreement with the
Ising model, unlike the recent claim by Nam et al [JSTAT {\bf (2014)}, P08011].

that for the two different beam energies considered the suppression of the

coming from the cross over or QGP phase. Our study reveals that only in
ultra-central collisions ($0 - 0.2 \%$) the $v_n(p_T)$ have a stronger
sensitivity to the T dependence of $\eta/s$ in the QGP phase and this
sensitivity increases with the order of the harmonic n. Moreover, the study of
the correlations between the initial spatial anisotropies $\epsilon_n$ and the
final flow coefficients $v_n$ shows that at LHC energies there is more
correlation than at RHIC energies. The degree of correlation increases from
peripheral to central collisions, but only in ultra-central collisions at LHC,
we find that the linear correlation coefficient $C(n,n) \approx 1$ for

density monotonically decreased toward the longer period and there was no
strong indication of a period gap. We detected possible negative superhumps in
Z Cha. It is possible that normal outbursts are also suppressed by the presence
of a disk tilt in this system. There was no indication of enhanced orbital
humps just preceding the superoutburst, and this result favors the
thermal-tidal disk instability as the origin of superoutbursts. We detected
superhumps in three AM CVn-type dwarf novae. Our observations and recent other
detections suggest that 8% of objects showing dwarf nova-type outbursts are AM
CVn-type objects. AM CVn-type objects and EI Psc-type object may be more

at CERN consists of 6M lines of in-house code, developed over a decade by
nearly 1000 physicists, as well as a comparable amount of general use
open-source code. A critical ingredient to the success of the construction and
early operation of the WLCG was the convergence, around the year 2000, on the
use of a homogeneous environment of commodity x86-64 processors and Linux.
Apache Mesos is a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation
and sharing across distributed applications, or frameworks. It can run Hadoop,
Jenkins, Spark, Aurora, and other applications on a dynamically shared pool of
nodes. We present how we migrated our continuos integration system to schedule
jobs on a relatively small Apache Mesos enabled cluster and how this resulted
in better resource usage, higher peak performance and lower latency thanks to
the dynamic scheduling capabilities of Mesos.

exterior is a highly non-unique problem. A spherical Hardy-Hodge decomposition
supplies information on what contributions of the magnetization $m$ are
recoverable but it does not supply geophysically suitable constraints on $m$
that would guarantee uniqueness for the entire magnetization. In this paper, we
focus on the case of induced spherical magnetizations and show that uniqueness
is guaranteed if one assumes that the magnetization is compactly supported on
the sphere. The results are based on ideas presented in Baratchart et al.
(2013) for the planar setting.

over time in the statistical distribution of well-being of individuals in a
society. The model predicts that when individuals overvalue the more socially
conspicuous aspects of well-being in their lifestyle choices, then the average
well-being of the overall population may experience continuous decline. In
addition to trade-off cost and overvaluation, we identify statistical variation
in individuals' well-being and turnover within the population as key factors
driving negative trends. We investigate the influence of the effects of
heterogeneity in the population, as well as economic and/or technological
progress.

be independent on past seismicity. However, by considering events in causal
relation, for example mother-daughter, it seems natural to assume that the
magnitude of a daughter event is conditionally dependent on the one of the
corresponding mother event. In order to find experimental evidence supporting
this hypothesis, we analyze different catalogs, both real and simulated, in two
different ways. From each catalog, we obtain the law of triggered events'
magnitude by kernel density. The results obtained show that the distribution
density of triggered events' magnitude varies with the magnitude of their
corresponding mother events. As the intuition suggests, an increase of mother
events' magnitude induces an increase of the probability of having ""high""
values of triggered events' magnitude. In addition, we see a statistically
significant increasing linear dependence of the magnitude means.
