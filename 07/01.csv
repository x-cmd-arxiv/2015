of the quasibound states of the black hole.

energy measurement for the air showers measured through their radio signal with
the LOFAR antennas. The energy reconstruction is performed using a

reconstructed, assuming that cosmic rays are composed only of protons or iron

recent IceCube discovery of high-energy neutrinos. We re-examine this
possibility within a new framework built upon the blazar simplified view and a
self-consistent modelling of neutrino emission from individual sources. The
former is a recently proposed paradigm that explains the diverse statistical
properties of blazars adopting minimal assumptions on blazars' physical and
geometrical properties. This view, tested through detailed Monte Carlo
simulations, reproduces the main features of radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray blazar
surveys and also the extragalactic gamma-ray background at energies > 10 GeV.
Here we add a hadronic component for neutrino production and estimate the
neutrino emission from BL Lacs as a class, ""calibrated"" by fitting the spectral
energy distributions of a preselected sample of BL Lac objects and their
(putative) neutrino spectra. Unlike all previous papers on this topic, the
neutrino background is then derived by summing up at a given energy the fluxes
of each BL Lac in the simulation, all characterised by their own redshift,
synchrotron peak energy, gamma-ray flux, etc. Our main result is that BL Lacs
as a class can explain the neutrino background seen by IceCube above ~ 0.5 PeV
while they only contribute ~ 10% at lower energies, leaving room to some other
population(s)/physical mechanism. However, one cannot also exclude the
possibility that individual BL Lacs still make a contribution at the ~ 20%
level to the IceCube low-energy events. Our scenario makes specific predictions
testable in the next few years.

propagating with speed of light and having energy, momentum, and angular

of the appropriate finite energy soliton can be converging to zero at infinity.
The ideal gas of such lightlike solitons with minimal twist parameter is

theorem along the following nested hierarchy of progressively more complex
structures: i) parameter estimation (within a model), ii) model selection and
comparison (within a paradigm), iii) paradigm evaluation. In such a hierarchy
the Bayesian evidence works both as the posterior's normalization at a given
level and as the likelihood function at the next level up. Whilst raising no
objections to the standard application of the procedure at the two lowest
levels, we argue that it should receive a considerable modification when
evaluating paradigms, when testability and fitting data are equally important.
By considering toy models we illustrate how models and paradigms that are
difficult to falsify are always favoured by the Bayes factor. We argue that the
evidence for a paradigm should not only be high for a given dataset, but
exceptional with respect to what it would have been, had the data been
different. With this motivation we propose a measure which we term
predictivity, as well as a prior to be incorporated into the Bayesian
framework, penalising unpredictivity as much as not fitting data. We apply this
measure to inflation seen as a whole, and to a scenario where a specific
inflationary model is hypothetically deemed as the only one viable as a result
of information alien to cosmology (e.g. Solar System gravity experiments, or
particle physics input). We conclude that cosmic inflation is currently hard to
falsify, but that this could change were external/additional information to
cosmology to select one of its many models. We also compare this state of

rectangular blocks of a different acoustic material exhibits total transmission
if certain conditions are met [1] which relate the unique ""intromission"" angle
of incidence with geometric and material properties of the slab. This
extraordinary acoustic transmission phenomenon holds for any slab thickness,
making it analogous to a Brewster effect in optics, and is independent of
frequency as long as the slab microstructure is sub-wavelength in the
length-wise direction. Here we show that the enhanced transmission effect is
obtained in a slab with grating elements oriented obliquely to the slab normal.
The dependence of the intromission angle $\theta_i$ is given explicitly in
terms of the orientation angle. Total transmission is achieved at incidence
angles $\pm \theta_i$, with a relative phase shift between the transmitted
amplitudes of the $+\theta_i$ and $- \theta_i$ cases. These effects are shown
to follow from explicit formulas for the transmission coefficient. In the case
of grating elements that are rigid the results have direct physical

In the experimental section, we analyze various aspects of our algorithm such
as predictive performance and ability to reconstruct task relationships on
biologically inspired synthetic data, where we have full control over the
underlying ground truth. We also experiment on a new dataset from the domain of
computational biology that we collected for the purpose of this paper. It

dynamical Love numbers divided by quality factors. Common is the (often
illegitimate) approximation of the dynamical Love numbers with their static
counterparts. As the static Love numbers are, approximately, proportional to
the inverse rigidity, this renders a popular fallacy that the tidal evolution
rate is determined by the product of the rigidity by the quality factor:
$\,k_l/Q\propto 1/(\mu Q)\,$. In reality, the dynamical Love numbers depend on
the tidal frequency and all rheological parameters of the tidally perturbed
body (not just rigidity). We demonstrate that in asteroidal binaries the
rigidity of their components plays virtually no role in tidal friction and
tidal lagging, and thereby has almost no influence on the intensity of tidal
interactions (tidal torques, tidal dissipation, tidally induced changes of the
orbit). A key quantity that determines the tidal evolution is a product of the
effective viscosity $\,\eta\,$ by the tidal frequency $\,\chi\,$. The
functional form of the torque's dependence on this product depends on who wins
in the competition between viscosity and self-gravitation. Hence a quantitative
criterion, to distinguish between two regimes. For higher values of
$\,\eta\chi\,$ we get $\,k_l/Q\propto 1/(\eta\chi)\;$; $\,$while for lower
values we obtain $\,k_l/Q\propto \eta\chi\,$. Our study rests on an assumption
that asteroids can be treated as Maxwell bodies. Applicable to rigid rocks at
low frequencies, this approximation is used here also for rubble piles, due to
the lack of a better model. In the future, as we learn more about mechanics of
granular mixtures in a weak gravity field, we may have to amend the tidal
theory with other rheological parameters, ones that do not show up in the
description of viscoelastic bodies.

submitted in the future), it has an efficient O(log n) implementation and it

performances that are close to optimal in a variety of realistic use cases.

effects the interpretation of pathology cases, whether it is diagnostic
accuracy, diagnostic confidence, or workflow efficiency. In this paper, digital
pathology images are analyzed to quantify the perceived difference in color
that occurs due to display aging, in particular a change in the maximum
luminance, white point, and color gamut. The digital pathology images studied
include diagnostically important features, such as the conspicuity of nuclei.
Three different display aging models are applied to images: aging of luminance
& chrominance, aging of chrominance only, and a stabilized luminance &
chrominance (i.e., no aging). These display models and images are then used to
compare conspicuity of nuclei using CIE deltaE2000, a perceptual color
difference metric. The effect of display aging using these display models and
images is further analyzed through a human reader study designed to quantify
the effects from a clinical perspective. Results from our reader study indicate
significant impact of aged displays on workflow as well as diagnosis as follow.
As compared to the originals (no-aging), slides with the effect of aging
simulated were significantly more difficult to read (p-value of 0.0005) and
took longer to score (p-value of 0.02). Moreover, luminance+chrominance aging
significantly reduced inter-session percent agreement of diagnostic scores
(p-value of 0.0418).

anatomical and quantum noise). Our analysis indicates that human observers
perform a lesion detection task by combining a number of sub-decisions, each an
indicator of the presence of a lesion in the image stack. This is in contrast
to a channelized Hotelling observer, where the detection task is conducted
holistically by thresholding a single decision variable, made from an optimally
weighted linear combination of channels. However, it seems that the sub-par
performance of human readers compared to the CHO cannot be fully explained by
their reliance on sub-decisions, or perhaps we do not consider a sufficient
number of sub-decisions. To bridge the gap between the performances of human
readers and the model observer based upon sub-decisions, we use an additive
noise model, the power of which is modulated with the level of background
complexity. The proposed model observer better predicts the fast drop in human

while guaranteeing specific controlled loss of accuracy. Analysis on
visualization of the discovered region confirms that not only can the proposed

the discovered region is consistent with human expert annotations. We also
propose a new framework to recognize the Roman coins which exploits
hierarchical structure of the ancient Roman coins using the state-of-the-art
classification power of the CNNs adopted to a new task of coin classification.
Experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to effectively
recognize the ancient Roman coins. For this research, we have collected a new
Roman coin dataset where all coins are annotated and consist of observe (head)
and reverse (tail) images.

spectral curves for the local almost del Pezzo surfaces of $\mathbb{F}_2$,
$\mathbb{F}_1$, the blowup of $\mathbb{P}^2$ in two points and a mass
deformation of the $E_8$ del Pezzo corresponding to different deformations of

compute the first few fermionic spectral traces from the conjectural spectral
determinant, and we compare them to analytic and numerical results in spectral
theory. In all these comparisons, we find that the conjecture is fully
validated with high numerical precision. For local $\mathbb{F}_2$ we expand the
spectral determinant around the orbifold point and find intriguing relations

component of a coupled model, on forecast reliability over seasonal timescales.
The relative impacts of these schemes upon the ocean mean state and ensemble
spread are analyzed. The oceanic variability induced by the atmospheric forcing
of the coupled system is, in most regions, the major source of ensemble spread.
The largest impact on spread and bias came from the Stochastically Perturbed
Parametrization Tendency (SPPT) scheme - which has proven particularly
effective in the atmosphere. The key regions affected are eddy-active regions,
namely the western boundary currents and the Southern Ocean. However, unlike
its impact in the atmosphere, SPPT in the ocean did not result in a significant
decrease in forecast error. Whilst there are good grounds for implementing
stochastic schemes in ocean models, our results suggest that they will have to
be more sophisticated. Some suggestions for next-generation stochastic schemes
are made.

Such a result helps people connect the robust Dynkin game with second-order

an optimal triplet. The mutual singularity of probabilities in causes major

by an asymmetry of the probability distribution of the instantaneous power $p$

and to manage a pole contribution that arises in the Born approximation
corresponding to the omega -> pi^0 gamma radiative decay. After implementing
hadronic form factors to account for finite-size corrections, we find that the
resulting photo-emission rates are comparable to existing results from pi rho
-> pi gamma processes in the energy regime of 1-3 GeV. We expect that our new
sources will provide a non-negligible contribution to the total hadronic rates,
thereby enhancing calculated thermal photon spectra from heavy-ion collisions,
which could improve the description of current direct-photon data from
experiment.

$\phi$-mesons have been identified in the dimuon decay channel in the
transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) range $1 < p_{\rm T} < 7$ GeV/$c$, both in
the p-going ($2.03 < y < 3.53$) and the Pb-going ($-4.46 < y < -2.96$)

0.19$~nb$^{-1}$ and $5.81 \pm 0.20$~nb$^{-1}$, respectively, for the two data
samples. Differential cross sections as a function of transverse momentum and

is measured for $2.96<|y|<3.53$, resulting in a ratio $\sim 0.5$ with no
significant $p_{\rm T}$ dependence within the uncertainties. The $p_{\rm T}$
dependence of the $\phi$ nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm pPb}$ exhibits an
enhancement up to a factor 1.6 at $p_{\rm T}$ = 3-4 GeV/$c$ in the Pb-going

the jobs will arrive for completion online. Each job j is preemptive and, upon
its arrival, its other characteristics are immediately revealed to the machine:
the deadline requirement, the workload and the value. The objective is to
maximize the aggregate value of jobs completed by their deadlines. Using the
minimum of the ratios of deadline minus arrival time to workload over all jobs
as the slackness s, a non-committed and a committed online scheduling algorithm
is proposed in [Lucier et al., SPAA'13; Azar et al., EC'15], achieving
competitive ratios of 2+f(s), where the big O notation
f(s)=\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{(\sqrt[3]{s}-1)^{2}}), and (2+f(s*b))/b respectively,
where b=\omega*(1-\omega), \omega is in (0, 1), and s is no less than 1/b. In
this paper, without recourse to the dual fitting technique used in the above

has been considered as a probe of gravitational waves from the cosmic
inflation. Ongoing and future experiments will, however, suffer from
contamination due to the B-modes of non-primordial origins, one of which is the
lensing induced B-mode polarization. Subtraction of the lensing B-modes,
usually referred to as delensing, will be required for further improvement of
detection sensitivity of the gravitational waves. In such experiments,
knowledge of statistical properties of the B-modes after delensing is
indispensable to likelihood analysis particularly because the lensing B-modes
are known to be non-Gaussian. In this paper, we study non-Gaussian structure of
the delensed B-modes on large scales, comparing them with those of the lensing
B-modes. In particular, we investigate the power spectrum correlation matrix
and the probability distribution function (PDF) of the power spectrum
amplitude. Assuming an experiment in which the quadratic delensing is an almost
optimal method, we find that delensing reduces correlations of the lensing
B-mode power spectra between different multipoles, and that the PDF of the
power spectrum amplitude is well described as a normal distribution function
with a variance larger than that in the case of a Gaussian field. These
features are well captured by an analytic model based on the 4th order
Edgeworth expansion. As a consequence of the non-Gaussianity, the constraint on
the tensor-to-scalar ratio after delensing is degraded within approximately a
few percent, which depends on the multipole range included in the analysis.

honey bees searching for a new colony or the collective navigation of fish

group's decision, as well as the mean trajectory of all the agents. The model

spatial position and, in a subsequent generalization of the model, by a
combination of initial position and a priori individual preference. The agents
have linear dynamics and are coupled through a modified form of quadratic cost.
Fixed point based finite population equilibrium conditions are identified and
associated existence conditions are established. In general multiple equilibria
may exist and the agents need to know all initial conditions to compute them
precisely. However, as the number of agents increases sufficiently, we show
that 1) the computed fixed point equilibria qualify as epsilon Nash equilibria,
2) agents no longer require all initial conditions to compute the equilibria
but rather can do so based on a representative probability distribution of
these conditions now viewed as random variables. Numerical results are
reported.

however suggested that high-frequency longitudinal vibration of bipyramidal

[M. Pelton et al., ""Viscoelastic flows in simple liquids generated by vibrating

of the purely radial vibration of an elastic sphere, also called the breathing
mode, in a compressible viscous fluid, and then extend our analysis to a
viscoelastic medium using the Maxwell fluid model. The effects of fluid
compressibility and viscoelasticity are discussed. Although in the case of
longitudinal vibration of bipyramidal nanoparticles, the effects of fluid
compressibility were shown to be negligible, we demonstrate that it plays a
significant role in the breathing mode of an elastic sphere. On the other hand,
despite the different vibration modes, the breathing mode of a sphere triggers
a viscoelastic response in water-glycerol mixtures similar to that triggered by
the longitudinal vibration of bipyramidal nanoparticles. We also comment on the
effect of fluid viscoelasticity on the idea of destroying virus particles by
acoustic resonance.

  Interstellar Probes","14 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables. V2 includes additional references",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A spacecraft pushed by radiation has the major advantage that the power
source is not included in the accelerated mass, making it the preferred
technique for reaching relativistic speeds. There are two main technical
challenges. First, to get significant acceleration, the sail must be both
extremely light weight and capable of operating at high intensities of the
incident beam and the resulting high temperatures. Second, the transmitter must
emit high power beams through huge apertures, many kilometers in diameter, in
order to focus radiation on the sail across the long distances needed to
achieve high final speeds. Existing proposals for the sail use carbon or
aluminum films, but aluminum is limited by a low melting point, and both have
low mechanical strength requiring either a distributed payload or complex
rigging. We propose here a graphene sail, which offers high absorption per unit
weight, high temperature operation, and the mechanical strength to support
simple rigging to a lumped mass payload. For the transmitter, existing
proposals use a compact high power source, and focus the energy with a large
(hundreds to thousands of km) space-based lens. Existing optical drive
proposals also require launch from the outer solar system, have severe pointing
restrictions, and require difficult maneuvering of the beam source. Instead we
propose an active Fresnel lens, allowing smaller apertures of less mass, easier
pointing with fewer restrictions, and probe launch from the inner solar system.
The technologies for both the sail and the transmitter are already under
development for other reasons. Worked examples, physically smaller and less
massive than those suggested so far, range from a 1kg payload launched to 10\%
of the speed of light by a transmitter only 25 times the mass of ISS, to a
larger system that can launch a 1000 kg payload to 50\% of the speed of light.

(S/N$>$3). From the low resolution 3D-HST spectra we measured the redshifts and
the H$\alpha$ fluxes for the whole sample (a factor of 1/1.2 was applied to the
observed fluxes to remove the [NII] contamination). The stellar masses
(M$_{\star}$), infrared (L$_{IR}$) and UV luminosities (L$_{UV}$) were derived
from the SEDs by fitting multi-band data from GALEX near-UV to SPIRE 500
$\mu$m. We estimated the continuum extinction E$_{star}$(B-V) from both the
IRX=L$_{IR}$/L$_{UV}$ ratio and the UV-slope, $\beta$, and found an excellent
agreement between the two. The nebular extinction was estimated from comparison
of the observed SFR$_{H\alpha}$ and SFR$_{UV}$. We obtained
\emph{f}=E$_{star}$(B-V)/E$_{neb}$(B-V)=0.93$\pm$0.06, i.e. higher than the
canonical value of \emph{f}=0.44 measured in the local Universe. Our derived
dust correction produces good agreement between the H$\alpha$ and IR+UV SFRs
for galaxies with SFR$\gtrsim$ 20 M$_{\odot}$/yr and M$_{\star} \gtrsim 5
\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, while objects with lower SFR and M$_{\star}$ seem
to require a smaller \emph{f}-factor (i.e. higher H$\alpha$ extinction
correction). Our results then imply that the nebular extinction for our sample
is comparable to that in the optical-UV continuum and suggest that the
\emph{f}-factor is a function of both M$_{\star}$ and SFR, in agreement with
previous studies.

entrain material from their surroundings and that their cores have a lower

Dust in other Type IIn SNe has been shown in previous works to reside in a
circumstellar shell of material ejected by the progenitor system in the few
millenia prior to explosion. Our model fits show that the dust in the system
shows no evidence for the strong, ubiquitous 9.7 $\mu$m feature from silicate
dust, suggesting the presence of carbonaceous grains. The observations are best
fit with 0.01-0.05 $\msun$ of carbonaceous dust radiating at a temperature of
$\sim 550-620$ K. The dust composition may reveal clues concerning the nature
of the progenitor system, which remains ambiguous for this subclass. Most of
the single star progenitor systems proposed for SNe IIn, such as luminous blue
variables, red supergiants, yellow hypergiants, and B[e] stars, all clearly
show silicate dust in their pre-SN outflows. However, this post-SN result is
consistent with the small sample of SNe IIn with mid-IR observations, none of

the absence of any $2\pi$ periodic terms in the current-phase relation of these

qualitatively different properties compared to harmonic odd steps of
conventional junctions. In addition, the RCSJs hosting Majorana bound states
also display an additional sequence of steps in the devil staircase structure
seen in their I-V characteristics; such sequence of steps make their I-V
characteristics qualitatively distinct from that of their conventional

show the gap normalised by the minimum value of the Ricci scalar of the space
is minimised when the space is a sphere. Our main result is then to show using
geometric arguments that precisely the same result holds for fluctuations of a
scalar operator in any holographic CFT. We prove this under the assumption that
the dual vacuum geometry is a smooth Einstein metric ending only on the
conformal boundary, and then consider fluctuations of a minimally coupled
massive scalar field about this. We also argue the holographic CFT will have
states dual to small bulk black holes whose existence is related to the energy
gap. We show the thermodynamic properties of these black holes obey a bound of
a similar nature to that of the scalar fluctuations - the ratio of CFT energy
to a power of entropy for the states dual to black holes in the 'small' limit
is bounded from below when appropriately normalised by the minimum Ricci scalar
of the boundary space. Again the bound is saturated for a sphere.

extinction-limited samples for five principal clusters, and constructed K-band
luminosity functions (KLF) that we compare with those of artificial clusters
with varying ages. This analysis provided mean ages and possible age spreads
for the clusters. We found that IC 1795, the centermost cluster of the complex,
still hosts a large fraction of young sources with circumstellar disks. This
indicates that star formation was active in IC 1795 as recently as 2 Myr ago,
simultaneous to the star forming activity in the flanking embedded clusters,
W3-Main and W3(OH). A comparison with carbon monoxide emission maps indicates
strong velocity gradients in the gas clumps hosting W3-Main and W3(OH) and show
small receding clumps of gas at IC 1795, suggestive of rapid gas removal
(faster than the T Tauri timescale) in the cluster forming regions. We discuss
one possible scenario for the progression of cluster formation in the W3
complex. We propose that early processes of gas collapse in the main structure
of the complex could have defined the progression of cluster formation across
the complex with relatively small age differences from one group to another.
However, triggering effects could act as catalysts for enhanced efficiency of
formation at a local level, in agreement with previous studies.

offer an inner working angle as low as 1 lambda/D. Non-common path, low-order

deformation of their bodies or appendages. Examples include small nematodes
moving through soil using whole-body undulations or spermatozoa swimming
through mucus using flagellar waves. When self-propulsion occurs in a
non-Newtonian fluid, one fundamental question is whether locomotion will occur
faster or slower than in a Newtonian environment. Here we consider the general
problem of swimming using small-amplitude periodic waves in a viscoelastic
fluid described by the classical Oldroyd-B constitutive relationship. Using
Taylor's swimming sheet model, we show that if all travelling waves move in the
same direction, the locomotion speed of the organism is systematically
decreased. However, if we allow waves to travel in two opposite directions, we
show that this can lead to enhancement of the swimming speed, which is
physically interpreted as due to asymmetric viscoelastic damping of waves with
different frequencies. A change of the swimming direction is also possible. By
analysing in detail the cases of swimming using two or three travelling waves,
we demonstrate that swimming can be enhanced in a viscoelastic fluid for all
Deborah numbers below a critical value or, for three waves or more, only for a
finite, non-zero range of Deborah numbers, in which case a finite amount of
elasticity in the fluid is required to increase the swimming speed.

coupled to changes in the lipid density within that monolayer. We find
dispersion relations describing three intuitive forms of bilayer motion,

ability to observe and measure the properties of bottomonium mesons. In order
to discover missing states it is useful to know their properties to develop a
successful search strategy. To this end we calculate the masses and decay
properties of excited bottomonium states. We use the relativized quark model to
calculate the masses and wavefunctions and the $^3P_0$ quark-pair creation
model to calculate decay widths to open bottom. We also summarize results for
radiative transitions, annihilation decays, hadronic transitions and production
cross sections which are used to develop strategies to find these states. We
find that the $b\bar{b}$ system has a rich spectroscopy that we expect to be
substantially extended by the LHC and $e^+e^-$ experiments in the near future.
Some of the most promising possibilities at the LHC are observing the
$\chi_{b(1,2)}(3P)$, $\chi_{b(1,2)}(4P)$ and $\eta_b(3S)$ states in $\gamma
\mu^+\mu^-$ final states that proceed via radiative transitions through
$\Upsilon(nS)$ intermediate states and $1^3D_J$ and $2^3D_J$ into $\gamma\gamma

and reconstruction--can be facilitated by expressing the signal as a linear
combination of atoms from a well-chosen dictionary. In this paper, we study
possible dictionaries for representing the discrete vector one obtains when
collecting a finite set of uniform samples from a multiband analog signal. By
analyzing the spectrum of combined time- and multiband-limiting operations in
the discrete-time domain, we conclude that the information level of the sampled
multiband vectors is essentially equal to the time-frequency area. For
representing these vectors, we consider a dictionary formed by concatenating a
collection of modulated Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's). We
study the angle between the subspaces spanned by this dictionary and an optimal
dictionary, and we conclude that the multiband modulated DPSS dictionary--which
is simple to construct and more flexible than the optimal dictionary in
practical applications--is nearly optimal for representing multiband sample
vectors. We also show that the multiband modulated DPSS dictionary not only
provides a very high degree of approximation accuracy in an MSE sense for
multiband sample vectors (using a number of atoms comparable to the information
level), but also that it can provide high-quality approximations of all sampled
sinusoids within the bands of interest.

phases we present in this work a detailed study of the effect of interactions
on Majorana zero modes bound to vortices in a superconducting surface of a 3D

pointed out, it can be tuned into the regime of strong interactions. We start
with a 0D system suggesting an experimental realization of the

experimentally observable using a tunnel probe. We then focus on
interaction-enabled crystalline topological phases that can be built with the
Majoranas in a vortex lattice in higher dimensions. In 1D we identify an
interesting exactly solvable model which is related to a previously discussed
one that exhibits an interaction-enabled topological phase. We study these

density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Our results confirm the existence

possible combinations of a given number of mutations. In the last years,
several experimental fitness landscapes have been completely resolved. As
fitness landscapes are high-dimensional, their characterization relies on
simple measures of their structure, which can be used as statistics in
empirical applications. Here we propose two new sets of measures that
explicitly capture two relevant features of fitness landscapes: epistasis and
constraints. The first set contains new measures for epistasis based on the
correlation of fitness effects of mutations. They have a natural
interpretation, capture well the interaction between mutations, can be obtained
analytically for most landscape models and can therefore be used to
discriminate between different models. The second set contains measures of
evolutionary constraints based on ""chains"" of forced mutations along
fitness-increasing paths. Some of these measures are non-monotonic in the
amount of epistatic interactions, but have instead a maximum for intermediate
values. We further characterize the relationships of these measures to the ones
that were previous proposed (e.g. number of peaks, roughness/slope, fraction of
non-additive components, etc). Finally, we show how these measures can help

Decomposability. We view the itemspace as a Nearly Decomposable system and we
define blocks of closely related elements and corresponding indirect proximity
components. We study the theoretical properties of the decomposition and we
derive sufficient conditions that guarantee full item space coverage even in
cold-start recommendation scenarios. A comprehensive set of experiments on the
MovieLens and the Yahoo!R2Music datasets, using several widely applied
performance metrics, support our model's theoretically predicted properties and
verify that NCDREC outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms, in terms of
recommendation accuracy, diversity and sparseness insensitivity.

been attributed to autocatalysis. However, the stability of homochiral states
in deterministic autocatalytic systems relies on cross inhibition of the two
chiral states, an unlikely scenario for early life self-replicators. Here, we
present a theory for a stochastic individual-level model of autocatalysis due
to early life self-replicators. Without chiral inhibition, the racemic state is
the global attractor of the deterministic dynamics, but intrinsic
multiplicative noise stabilizes the homochiral states, in both well-mixed and
spatially-extended systems. We conclude that autocatalysis is a viable
mechanism for homochirality, without imposing additional nonlinearities such as
chiral inhibition.

symmetry of a system is spontaneously broken. The Thouless-Valatin inertia, the
collective inertia of the NG mode, contains important information concerning
collective motion.
  Purpose: To establish an efficient and precise method for deriving the
collective inertia and the conjugate operator of a NG mode, we derive an
expression for the response function in terms of the coordinate-momentum
representation of the quasiparticle random-phase approximation which is valid
even if a symmetry-restoring zero-energy mode is present.
  Methods: We use the finite amplitude method for computing the response
function of superfluid nuclei with the nuclear density functional theory.
  Results: We derived analytically the collective inertia and the conjugate
coordinate operator of the NG mode from the zero-energy linear response with
the momentum operator of the NG mode. The formulation is tested in the cases of
translational and pairing rotational modes. Illustrative calculations are
performed for the neutron pairing rotation in Sn isotopes, the proton pairing
rotation in N = 82 isotones, and the neutron and proton pairing rotations
around the 130Xe nucleus.
  Conclusions: The proposed formulation allows us to compute the collective
inertia of the NG mode precisely and efficiently. The conjugate coordinate
operator can be utilized to remove spurious contributions to the strength
distribution in the finite amplitude method.

We achieved precisions of 2--3 km/s, and combined these with astrometric and
spectrophotometric data to calculate $UVW$ velocities. Most are members of the
thin disk of the Galaxy, and velocity dispersions indicate a mean age of
5.2$\pm$0.2 Gyr for sources within 20 pc. We find significantly different
kinematic ages between late-M dwarfs (4.0$\pm$0.2 Gyr) and L dwarfs
(6.5$\pm$0.4 Gyr) in our sample that are contrary to predictions from prior
simulations. This difference appears to be driven by a dispersed population of
unusually blue L dwarfs which may be more prevalent in our local volume-limited
sample than in deeper magnitude-limited surveys. The L dwarfs exhibit an
asymmetric $U$ velocity distribution with a net inward flow, similar to
gradients recently detected in local stellar samples. Simulations incorporating

thickness of up to 7 layers (4 nm) and an average lateral size smaller than 20

the crystalline quality and low oxidation states of the bulk material. The
small lateral size and reduced number of layers provided these nanodots with an
easier path for the electron transport and plentiful active sites for the
catalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic electrolyte. The MoS2

cases we expect heavy-to-very-heavy squarks as suggested by a decoupling
solution to the SUSY flavor and CP problems and by the gravitino problem. For
all cases, initial SUSY discovery would likely occur in the multi-b-jet +
ETMISS channel. The CSB scenario would be revealed by the presence of
highly-ionizing, terminating tracks from quasi-stable charginos. As further
data accrue, the RNS scenario with 100-200 GeV higgsino-like LSPs would be
revealed by the build-up of a mass edge/bump in the OS/SF dilepton invariant
mass which is bounded by the neutralino mass difference. The mSUGRA/CMSSM
archetype would contain neither of these features but would be revealed by a
buildup of the usual multi-lepton cascade decay signatures.

problems. A task is specified by an input/output relation, defining for each
set of processes that may run concurrently, and each assignment of inputs to
the processes in the set, the valid outputs of the processes. An object is
specified by an automaton describing the outputs the object may produce when it
is accessed sequentially. Thus, tasks explicitly state what may happen only
when sets of processes run concurrently, while objects only specify what
happens when processes access the object sequentially. Each one requires its
own implementation notion, to tell when an execution satisfies the
specification. For objects linearizability is commonly used, a very elegant and
useful consistency condition. For tasks implementation notions are less
explored.
  The paper introduces the notion of interval-sequential object. The
corresponding implementation notion of interval-linearizability generalizes
linearizability, and allows to associate states along the interval of execution
of an operation. Interval-linearizability allows to specify any task, however,
there are sequential one-shot objects that cannot be expressed as tasks, under
the simplest interpretation of a task. It also shows that a natural extension
of the notion of a task is expressive enough to specify any interval-sequential

given the fact that there is no direct measurement of magnetic field in the
corona. An alternative way is to use the magnetic field measurement in the
solar wind from in-situ instruments. On 2012 July 12, an HC was observed prior
to and during a coronal mass ejection (CME) by the AIA high-temperature images.
The HC is invisible in the EUVI low-temperature images, which only show the
cooler leading front (LF). However, both the LF and an ejecta can be observed
in the coronagraphic images. These are consistent with the high temperature and
high density of the HC and support that the ejecta is the erupted HC. In the
meanwhile, the associated CME shock was identified ahead of the ejecta and the
sheath through the COR2 images, and the corresponding ICME was detected by
\textit{ACE}, showing the shock, sheath and magnetic cloud (MC) sequentially,
which agrees with the coronagraphic observations. Further, the MC contained a
low-ionization-state center and a high-ionization-state shell, consistent with
the pre-existing HC observation and its growth through magnetic reconnection.
All of these observations support that the MC detected near the Earth is the
counterpart of the erupted HC in the corona for this event. Therefore, our
study provides strong observational evidence of the HC as an MFR.

by a two-dimensional potential flow is presented. By taking advantage of the
conformal invariance of the model, a numerical method is introduced that tracks
the evolution of the object boundary in terms of a time-dependent Laurent
series. Simulations of a variety of dissolving objects are shown, which shrink
and then collapse to a single point in finite time. The simulations reveal a
surprising exact relationship whereby the collapse point is the root of a
non-analytic function given in terms of the flow velocity and the Laurent
series coefficients describing the initial shape. This result is subsequently
derived using residue calculus. The structure of the non-analytic function is
examined for three different test cases, and a practical approach to determine
the collapse point using a generalized Newton--Raphson root-finding algorithm
is outlined. These examples also illustrate the possibility that the model
breaks down in finite time prior to complete collapse, due to a topological
singularity, as the dissolving boundary overlaps itself rather than breaking up
into multiple domains (analogous to droplet pinch-off in fluid mechanics). In
summary, the model raises fundamental mathematical questions about broken
symmetries in finite-time singularities of both continuous and stochastic
dynamical systems.

the optimization problem there has a non-linear objective and non-linear

global minima of the optimization problem correspond to Nash equilibria of the

specific-star-formation rate divided by that of main-sequence galaxies, and
with LIR, consistent with the results for field galaxies. The relation between
L8/LIR and LIR is between those at z=0 and z=2 in the literature. Our data also
shows that starburst galaxies, which have lower L8/LIR than main-sequence, are
located only in the outskirt of the cluster. All these findings extend previous

the pilot contamination attack (PCA) in which each of eavesdroppers transmits
its target user's training sequence in hopes of acquiring possible information
leak by steering beam towards the eavesdropper. We show that there exists a
crucial complementary relation between the received signal strengths at the

inevitably leaves a trace that enables us to devise a way of measuring the

unified in a single learning model. Moreover, SSDH performs joint learning of
image representations, hash codes, and classification in a point-wised manner,

$(q,\chi_{BH}) = (7, \pm 0.4), (7, \pm 0.6)$, and $(5, -0.9)$. We find that:
(i) the recently published SEOBNRv1 and SEOBNRv2 models of the
Effective-One-Body family disagree with each other (mismatches of a few
percent) for black hole spins $\geq 0.5$ or $\leq -0.3$, with waveform mismatch
accumulating during early inspiral; (ii) comparison with numerical waveforms
indicate that this disagreement is due to phasing errors of SEOBNRv1, with
SEOBNRv2 in good agreement with all of our simulations; (iii) Phenomenological
waveforms disagree with SEOBNRv2 over most of the NSBH binary parameter space;
(iv) comparison with NR waveforms shows that most of the model's dephasing
accumulates near the frequency interval where it switches to a phenomenological
phasing prescription; and finally (v) both SEOBNR and post-Newtonian (PN)
models are effectual for NSBH systems, but PN waveforms will give a significant
bias in parameter recovery. Our results suggest that future gravitational-wave
detection searches and parameter estimation efforts targeted at NSBH systems
with $q\lesssim 7$ and $\chi_\mathrm{BH} \approx [-0.9, +0.6]$ will benefit
from using SEOBNRv2 templates. For larger black hole spins and/or binary
mass-ratios, we recommend the models be further investigated as suitable NR
simulations become available.

  PolSAR Image Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image classification, it is a challenge to
classify the aggregated terrain types, such as the urban area, into semantic
homogenous regions due to sharp bright-dark variations in intensity. The
aggregated terrain type is formulated by the similar ground objects aggregated
together. In this paper, a polarimetric hierarchical semantic model (PHSM) is
firstly proposed to overcome this disadvantage based on the constructions of a
primal-level and a middle-level semantic. The primal-level semantic is a
polarimetric sketch map which consists of sketch segments as the sparse
representation of a PolSAR image. The middle-level semantic is a region map
which can extract semantic homogenous regions from the sketch map by exploiting
the topological structure of sketch segments. Mapping the region map to the
PolSAR image, a complex PolSAR scene is partitioned into aggregated, structural
and homogenous pixel-level subspaces with the characteristics of relatively
coherent terrain types in each subspace. Then, according to the characteristics
of three subspaces above, three specific methods are adopted, and furthermore
polarimetric information is exploited to improve the segmentation result.
Experimental results on PolSAR data sets with different bands and sensors
demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art
methods in region homogeneity and edge preservation for terrain classification.

We follow our previous work \cite{aes14}, where we derived an upscaled model in
the form of generalized nonlinear diffusion model to describe the effects of
kerogen. To model the interaction between the matrix and the fractures, we use
Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method. In this approach, the matrix and
the fracture interaction is modeled via local multiscale basis functions. We
developed the GMsFEM and applied for linear flows with horizontal or vertical
fracture orientations on a Cartesian fine grid. In this paper, we consider
arbitrary fracture orientations and use triangular fine grid and developed
GMsFEM for nonlinear flows. Moreover, we develop online basis function
strategies to adaptively improve the convergence. The number of multiscale
basis functions in each coarse region represents the degrees of freedom needed
to achieve a certain error threshold. Our approach is adaptive in a sense that
the multiscale basis functions can be added in the regions of interest.
Numerical results for two-dimensional problem are presented to demonstrate the
efficiency of proposed approach.

actions only to the extent that it can extract from these data information
about the future state of the world. An essential aspect of the problem in all
these forms is that not all features of the past carry predictive power. Since
there are costs associated with representing and transmitting information, a
natural hypothesis is that sensory systems have developed coding strategies
that are optimized to minimize these costs, keeping only a limited number of
bits of information about the past and ensuring that these bits are maximally
informative about the future. Another important feature of the prediction
problem is that the physics of the world is diverse enough to contain a wide
range of possible statistical ensembles, yet not all motion is probable. Thus,
the brain might not be a generalized predictive machine; it might have evolved
to specifically solve the prediction problems most common in the natural
environment. This paper reviews recent results on predictive coding and optimal
predictive information in the retina and suggests approaches for quantifying
prediction in response to natural motion.

topologically nontrivial gap and a transition from a WSM to a three-dimensional

a direct transition from a WSM to a 3D diffusive anomalous Hall metal. (III)
Two Weyl nodes can emerge near the zone center when an insulating gap closes

A
central component of online advertising is the underlying mechanism that
selects and prices the winning ads for a given ad slot. In this paper we study
designing a mechanism for the Combinatorial Auction with Identical Items (CAII)
in which we are interested in selling $k$ identical items to a group of bidders
each demanding a certain number of items between $1$ and $k$. CAII generalizes
important online advertising scenarios such as image-text and video-pod
auctions [GK14]. In image-text auction we want to fill an advertising slot on a
publisher's web page with either $k$ text-ads or a single image-ad and in
video-pod auction we want to fill an advertising break of $k$ seconds with
video-ads of possibly different durations.
  Our goal is to design truthful mechanisms that satisfy Revenue Monotonicity
(RM). RM is a natural constraint which states that the revenue of a mechanism
should not decrease if the number of participants increases or if a participant
increases her bid.
  [GK14] showed that no deterministic RM mechanism can attain PoRM of less than
$\ln(k)$ for CAII, i.e., no deterministic mechanism can attain more than
$\frac{1}{\ln(k)}$ fraction of the maximum social welfare. [GK14] also design a
mechanism with PoRM of $O(\ln^2(k))$ for CAII.
  In this paper, we seek to overcome the impossibility result of [GK14] for
deterministic mechanisms by using the power of randomization. We show that by
using randomization, one can attain a constant PoRM. In particular, we design a
randomized RM mechanism with PoRM of $3$ for CAII.

we created a new theoretical formalism for describing the PSDs and time lags
produced via a combination of stochastic particle injection and emission via
the synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton, and external Compton (EC) processes.
This formalism used the Thomson cross section and simple $\delta$-function
approximations to model the synchrotron and Compton emissivities. Here we
expand upon this work, using the full Compton cross section and detailed and
accurate emissivities. Our results indicate good agreement between the PSDs
computed using the $\delta$-function approximations and those computed using
the accurate expressions, provided the observed photons are produced primarily
by electrons with energies exceeding the lower limit of the injected particle
population. Breaks are found in the PSDs at frequencies corresponding to the
cooling timescales of the electrons primarily responsible for the observed
emission, and the associated time lags are related to the difference in
electron cooling timescales between the two energy channels, as expected. If
the electron cooling timescales can be determined from the observed time lags
and/or the observed EC PSDs, then one could in principle use the method
developed here to determine the energy of the external seed photon source for
EC, which is an important unsolved problem in blazar physics.

random acceleration MD (mRAMD), and memetic algorithms (MA). In mRAMD, finding
exit pathways is based on a non-Markovian biasing that is introduced to
optimize the unbinding force. In MA, hybrid learning protocols are exploited to
predict optimal ligand exit paths. The methods are tested on three proteins

height $H$, steadily sliding on top of a rigid solid within a generic
rate-and-state friction type constitutive framework, fully accounting for
elastodynamic effects. We derive the linear stability spectrum, quantifying the
interplay between stabilization related to the frictional constitutive law and
destabilization related both to the elastodynamic bi-material coupling between
normal stress variations and interfacial slip, and to finite size effects. The
stabilizing effects related to the frictional constitutive law include
velocity-strengthening friction (i.e.~an increase in frictional resistance with
increasing slip velocity, both instantaneous and under steady-state conditions)
and a regularized response to normal stress variations. We first consider the
small wave-number $k$ limit and demonstrate that homogeneous sliding in this
case is universally unstable, independently of the details of the friction law.
This universal instability is mediated by propagating waveguide-like modes,
whose fastest growing mode is characterized by a wave-number satisfying $k
H\!\sim\!{\cal O}(1)$ and by a growth rate that scales with $H^{-1}$. We then
consider the limit $k H\!\to\!\infty$ and derive the stability phase diagram in
this case. We show that the dominant instability mode travels at nearly the
dilatational wave-speed in the opposite direction to the sliding direction.
Instability modes which travel at nearly the shear wave-speed in the sliding
direction also exist in some range of physical parameters. Finally, we show
that a finite-time regularized response to normal stress variations, within the
framework of generalized rate-and-state friction models, tends to promote
stability.

feeds per beam. In these systems, each gateway serves a set of beams (cluster)
so that the overall data traffic is generated at different geographical areas.
Full frequency reuse among beams is considered so that interference mitigation
techniques are mandatory. Precisely, this paper aims at designing the precoding
scheme which, in contrast to single gateway schemes, entails two main
challenges. First, the precoding matrix shall be separated into feed groups
assigned to each gateway. Second, complete channel state information (CSI) is
required at each gateway, leading to a large communication overhead. In order
to solve these problems, a design based on a regularized singular value block
decomposition of the channel matrix is presented so that both inter-cluster
(i.e. beams of different clusters) and intra-cluster (i.e. beams of the same
cluster) interference is minimized. In addition, different gateway cooperative
schemes are analysed in order to keep the inter-gateway communication low.
Furthermore, the impact of the feeder link interference (i.e. interference
between different feeder links) is analysed and it is shown both numerically
and analytically that the system performance is reduced severally whenever this
interference occurs even though precoding reverts this additional interference.
Finally, numerical simulations are shown considering the latest fixed broadband
communication standard DVB-S2X so that the quantized feedback effect is
evaluated. The proposed precoding technique results to achieve a performance
close to the single gateway operation even when the cooperation among gateways
is low.

screening and local magnetic exchange interaction in heavy electron compounds.
On the dominant background of the heavy fermion state, the introduction of the
Heisenberg antiferromagnetic interaction ($J_H$) leads to superconducting
pairing instability. Depending on the strength of the interactions, it is found
that the pairing symmetry prefers an extended $s$-wave for small $J_H$ and high
conduction electron density but a chiral $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$-wave for large
$J_H$ and low conduction electron density, which provides a phase diagram of
pairing symmetry from the calculations of the ground-state energy. The
transition between these two pairing symmetries is found to be first-order.
Furthermore, we also analyze the phase diagram from the pairing strengths and
find that the phase diagram obtained is qualitatively consistent with that
based on the ground-state energy. In addition, we propose an effective
single-band BCS Hamiltonian, which is able to describe the low-energy
thermodynamic behaviors of the heavy fermion superconducting states. These
results further deepen the understanding of the antiferromagnetic interaction
which results in a geometric frustration for the model studied. Our work may
provide a possible scenario to understand the pairing symmetry of the heavy
fermion superconductivity, which is the one of active issues in very recent

diversity of host stars (from M- to A-type stars). Tidal dissipation in stellar
convective envelopes is a key actor that shapes the orbital architecture of
short-period systems. Our objective is to understand and evaluate how tidal
dissipation in the convective envelope of low-mass stars (from M to F types)
depends on their mass, evolutionary stage and rotation. Using a simplified
two-layer assumption, we compute analytically the frequency-averaged tidal
dissipation in their convective envelope. This dissipation is due to the
conversion into heat of the kinetic energy of tidal non wave-like/equilibrium
flow and inertial waves because of the viscous friction applied by turbulent
convection. Using grids of stellar models allows us to study the variation of
the dissipation as a function of stellar mass and age on the Pre-Main-Sequence
and on the Main-Sequence for stars with masses spanning from $0.4$ to
$1.4M_{\odot}$. As shown by observations, tidal dissipation in stars varies
over several orders of magnitude as a function of stellar mass, age and
rotation. During their Pre-Main-Sequence, all low-mass stars have an increase
of the frequency-averaged tidal dissipation for a fixed angular velocity in
their convective envelope until they reach a critical aspect and mass ratios.
Next, the dissipation evolves on the Main Sequence to an asymptotic value that
becomes maximum for $0.6M_{\odot}$ K-type stars and that decreases by several
orders of magnitude with increasing stellar mass. Finally, the rotational
evolution of low-mass stars strengthens the importance of tidal dissipation
during the Pre-Main-Sequence for star-planet and multiple star systems.

precise conditions on the matrix $A$ under which the statistical precision of
the individual units is comparable to that of a (gold standard) virtual
centralized estimate, even though each unit does not have access to all of the

remarkable performance for moderate algorithmic cost.

that over all finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$, any homogeneous depth-$5$ circuit

the period and period change to all available data and a stellar modelling tool
to model the binary parameters from photometric and radial-velocity data.
  Results. Four out of the seven selected binaries show non-zero period change
values at two-sigma confidence level. We also report for the first time the

model. It can be considered a Bayesian version of machine learning tree
ensemble methods where the individual trees are the base learners. However for
data sets where the number of variables $p$ is large (e.g. $p>5,000$) the
algorithm can become prohibitively expensive, computationally.
  Another method which is popular for high dimensional data is random forests,
a machine learning algorithm which grows trees using a greedy search for the
best split points. However, as it is not a statistical model, it cannot produce
probabilistic estimates or predictions.
  We propose an alternative algorithm for BART called BART-BMA, which uses
Bayesian Model Averaging and a greedy search algorithm to produce a model which
is much more efficient than BART for datasets with large $p$. BART-BMA
incorporates elements of both BART and random forests to offer a model-based
algorithm which can deal with high-dimensional data.
  We have found that BART-BMA can be run in a reasonable time on a standard
laptop for the ""small $n$ large $p$"" scenario which is common in many areas of
bioinformatics. We showcase this method using simulated data and data from two
real proteomic experiments; one to distinguish between patients with
cardiovascular disease and controls and another to classify agressive from
non-agressive prostate cancer. We compare our results to their main
competitors.

caching strategic contents at the network edge, thereby reducing latency. In
this paper, we investigate cache-enabled small cells in which we model and
characterize the outage probability, defined as the probability of not
satisfying users requests over a given coverage area. We analytically derive a
closed form expression of the outage probability as a function of
signal-to-interference ratio, cache size, small cell base station density and
threshold distance. By assuming the distribution of base stations as a Poisson

Specifically, in the discrete model each cell of the low-density populations is
individually described by a set of time-dependent variables, whereas in the
continuum model the high-density populations are described as a whole by a
small set of continuous variables depending on space and time. Communications
among populations, which translate into interactions among the discrete and the

simulations. We show that in perfect and surface deformed wires the free TDWs
behave differently, as the 3D TDWs combine into metastable states with average
lifetimes of 300ns depending on roughness, while the 2D TDWs do not due to 2D
shape anisotropy. When the 2D and 3D TDWs are pinned at artificial
constrictions, they behave similarly as they interact mainly through the
dipolar field. This magnetostatic interaction is well described by the point
charge model with multipole expansion. In surface deformed wires with
artificial constrictions, the interaction becomes more complex as the depinning
field decreases and dynamical pinning can lead to local resonances. This can
strongly influence the control of TDWs in DW-based devices.

us with a powerful method to estimate its size and density. In particular,
because of their high ionization energy, atoms with high atomic number (Z)
absorb short-wavelength radiation in the upper atmosphere, undetectable with
observations in visible light. One implication is that the planet should appear
larger during a primary transit observed in high energy bands than in the
optical band. The last Venus transit in 2012 offered a unique opportunity to
study this effect. The transit has been monitored by solar space observations
from Hinode and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We measure the radius of
Venus during the transit in three different bands with subpixel accuracy:
optical (4500A), UV (1600A, 1700A), Extreme UltraViolet (EUV, 171-335A) and
soft X-rays (about 10A). We find that, while the Venus optical radius is about
80 km larger than the solid body radius (the expected opacity mainly due to
clouds and haze), the radius increases further by more than 70 km in the EUV
and soft X-rays. These measurements mark the densest ion layers of Venus'
ionosphere, providing information about the column density of CO2 and CO. They
are useful for planning missions in situ to estimate the dynamical pressure
from the environment, and can be employed as a benchmark case for observations
with future missions, such as the ESA Athena, which will be sensitive enough to
detect transits of exoplanets in high-energy bands.

galaxy populations in which they are identified. We use a suite of halo
occupation distribution (HOD) mocks in a simulation, identify voids in these
populations using the ZOBOV void finder and measure their abundances, sizes,
tracer densities, and dark matter content. To separate the effects of bias from
those of sampling density, we do the same for voids traced by randomly
down-sampled subsets of the simulation dark matter particles. At the same
sampling density, galaxy bias reduces the total number of voids by ~50% and can
dramatically change their size distribution. The matter content of voids in
biased and unbiased tracers also differs. Deducing void properties from
simulation therefore requires the use of realistic galaxy mocks. We discuss how
the void observables can be related to their matter content. In particular we
consider the compensation of the total mass deficit in voids and find that the
distinction between over- and under-compensated voids is not a function of void
size alone, as has previously been suggested. However, we find a simple linear
relationship between the average density of tracers in the void and the total
mass compensation on much larger scales. The existence of this linear
relationship holds independent of the bias and sampling density of the tracers.
This provides a universal tool to classify void environments and will be
important for the use of voids in observational cosmology.

Herschel-SPIRE data. MALT90 observations allow us to ascertain their
association with the central HII region. We identify Class 0/I YSOs using their
Spitzer and Herschel-PACS emissions. These methods will be applied to the
entire sample of candidate bipolar HII regions. This paper focuses on two
bipolar HII regions, one interesting in terms of its morphology,
G319.88$+$00.79, and one in terms of its star formation, G010.32$-$00.15. Their
exciting clusters are identified and their photometric distances estimated to
be 2.6 kpc and 1.75 kpc, respectively. We suggest that these regions formed in
dense and flat structures that contain filaments. They have a central ionized
region and ionized lobes perpendicular to the parental cloud. The remains of
the parental cloud appear as dense (more than 10^4 per cm^3) and cold (14-17 K)
condensations. The dust in the PDR is warm (19-25 K). Dense massive clumps are
present around the central ionized region. G010.32-00.14 is especially
remarkable because five clumps of several hundred solar masses surround the
central HII region; their peak column density is a few 10^23 per cm^2, and the
mean density in their central regions reaches several 10^5 per cm^3. Four of
them contain at least one massive YSO; these clumps also contain extended green
objects and Class II methanol masers. This morphology suggests that the
formation of a second generation of massive stars has been triggered by the
central bipolar HII region. It occurs in the compressed material of the
parental cloud.

is continuous, whereas a weaker notion of convergence is introduced to
establish a convergence result to a possibly discontinuous distance function.
In terms of the geometry of the interfaces, we give a necessary and sufficient

reduce the size of parasitic networks. Unfortunately, the efficient reduction
of passive networks with many ports is still an open problem. Existing
techniques do not scale well with the number of ports, and lead to dense
reduced models that burden subsequent simulations. In this paper, we propose
TurboMOR, a novel MOR technique for the efficient reduction of passive RC
networks. TurboMOR is based on moment-matching, achieved through efficient
congruence transformations based on Householder reflections. A novel feature of
TurboMOR is the block-diagonal structure of the reduced models, that makes them
more efficient than the dense models produced by existing techniques. Moreover,
the model structure allows for an insightful interpretation of the reduction
process in terms of system theory. Numerical results show that TurboMOR scales
more favourably than existing techniques in terms of reduction time, simulation
time and memory consumption.

only one of these structures contributes to the three-point function of the
energy-momentum tensor and the other one is present in those N=4 superconformal

general N=4 superconformal field theories admit two inequivalent flavour
current multiplets and show that the three-point function of each of them is
determined by one tensor structure. As an example, we compute the two- and
three-point functions of the conserved currents in N=4 superconformal models of
free hypermultiplets. We also derive the universal relations between the
coefficients appearing in the two- and three-point correlators of the

principles of systems neuroscience with semiconductor electronics, with the aim

consumptions, comparable to those of the nervous system. However, until now the
neuromorphic approach has been restricted to relatively simple circuits and
specialized functions, rendering elusive a direct comparison of their energy
consumption to that used by conventional von Neumann digital machines solving
real-world tasks. Here we show that a recent technology developed by IBM can be
leveraged to realize neuromorphic circuits that operate as classifiers of
complex real-world stimuli. These circuits emulate enough neurons to compete
with state-of-the-art classifiers. We also show that the energy consumption of
the IBM chip is typically 2 or more orders of magnitude lower than that of
conventional digital machines when implementing classifiers with comparable
performance. Moreover, the spike-based dynamics display a trade-off between
integration time and accuracy, which naturally translates into algorithms that
can be flexibly deployed for either fast and approximate classifications, or
more accurate classifications at the mere expense of longer running times and
higher energy costs. This work finally proves that the neuromorphic approach
can be efficiently used in real-world applications and it has significant
advantages over conventional digital devices when energy consumption is

also obtain the following new results: (1) there are two integer mirror Chern
numbers ($\mathbb{Z}^2$) in the $pm$ group but only one ($\mathbb{Z}$) in the
$cm$ or $p3m1$ group for both the spinless and spinful cases; (2) for the $pmm$

$\mathbb{Z}^4$ ($\mathbb{Z}^2$) classifications in the spinful case; (3) we
show how topological crystalline insulator phase in the $pg$ group is related

(LTHM-XRD) measurements have been carried out at different temperatures (T) and
magnetic fields (H) to investigate the structural phase diagram for phase
separated La0.175Pr0.45Ca0.375MnO3 (LPCMO) manganite. The antiferromagnetic
(AFM) P21/m insulating phase undergoes field induced transformation to
ferromagnetic (FM) Pnma metallic ground state below its AFM ordering
temperature (220K) in zero-field cooling (ZFC) from room temperature. At
temperature greater than 25K, the field induced FM Pnma phase remained
irreversible even after complete removal of field. However, for T ( 39-65K),
the field induced transformation is partially reversible. This behaviour has
been attributed to magnetic field induced devitrification of the glass-like
arrested AFM P21/m phase to FM Pnma equilibrium phase. The devitrified FM Pnma
phase starts transforming back to AFM P21/m phase around ~39K on heating the
sample under zero field. Our results corroborate the evidence of strong
magneto-structural coupling in this system. An H-T phase-diagram has been
constructed based on LTHM-XTD data, which resembles with the one made from
magnetic measurements. These results have been explained on the basis of
kinetic arrest of first order phase transition and field induced
devitrification of the arrested phase.

Heating the solar corona to several million degrees requires the
conversion of magnetic energy into thermal energy. In this paper, we
investigate whether an unstable magnetic thread within a coronal loop can
destabilise a neighbouring magnetic thread. Aims. By running a series of
simulations, we aim to understand under what conditions the destabilisation of
a single magnetic thread can also trigger a release of energy in a nearby
thread. Methods. The 3D magnetohydrodynamics code, Lare3d, is used to simulate
the temporal evolution of coronal magnetic fields during a kink instability and
the subsequent relaxation process. We assume that a coronal magnetic loop
consists of non-potential magnetic threads that are initially in an equilibrium
state. Results. The non-linear kink instability in one magnetic thread forms a
helical current sheet and initiates magnetic reconnection. The current sheet
fragments, and magnetic energy is released throughout that thread. We find
that, under certain conditions, this event can destabilise a nearby thread,
which is a necessary requirement for starting an avalanche of energy release in
magnetic threads. Conclusions. It is possible to initiate an energy release in
a nearby, non-potential magnetic thread, because the energy released from one
unstable magnetic thread can trigger energy release in nearby threads, provided
that the nearby structures are close to marginal stability.

the $G(331)$ models with an extended symmetry of $SU(3)_C\otimes SU(3)_L\otimes

spontaneously broken. Two patterns of symmetry breaking in the $G(221)$ models
are considered in this work: one is $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_2 \otimes U(1)_X \to
SU(2)_L\otimes U(1)_Y$, the other is $SU(2)_1\otimes SU(2)_2 \otimes U(1)_Y \to

analysis of $W^\prime$ and $Z^\prime$ phenomenology in ten new physics models,
including all the channels of $W^\prime/Z^\prime$ decay. Our study shows that
the leptonic mode and the dijet mode of $W^\prime/Z^\prime$ decays impose a
very stringent bound on the parameter space in several new physics models. Such
tight bounds provide a useful guide for building new physics models to address
on the diboson anomalies. We also note that the Left-Right and Lepton-Phobic

The key idea of MF is that there exists latent structures in the data, by
uncovering which we could obtain a compressed representation of the data. By
factorizing an original matrix to low-rank matrices, MF provides a unified
method for dimension reduction, clustering, and matrix completion. In this
article we review several important variants of MF, including: Basic MF,
Non-negative MF, Orthogonal non-negative MF. As can be told from their names,
non-negative MF and orthogonal non-negative MF are variants of basic MF with
non-negativity and/or orthogonality constraints. Such constraints are useful in
specific senarios. In the first part of this article, we introduce, for each of
these models, the application scenarios, the distinctive properties, and the
optimizing method. By properly adapting MF, we can go beyond the problem of
clustering and matrix completion. In the second part of this article, we will

various regularization methods, and make use of MF for (semi-)supervised
learning by introducing latent space reinforcement and transformation. We will

interdependencies among its individual components. Several algorithms have been
proposed to detect directed dynamical influences between time series. Two of
the most used approaches are a model-free one (transfer entropy) and a
model-based one (Granger causality). Several pitfalls are related to the
presence or absence of assumptions in modeling the relevant features of the
data. We tried to overcome those pitfalls using a neural network approach in
which a model is built without any a priori assumptions. In this sense this
method can be seen as a bridge between model-free and model-based approaches.
The experiments performed will show that the method presented in this work can
detect the correct dynamical information flows occurring in a system of time
series. Additionally we adopt a non-uniform embedding framework according to
which only the past states that actually help the prediction are entered into
the model, improving the prediction and avoiding the risk of overfitting. This
method also leads to a further improvement with respect to traditional Granger
causality approaches when redundant variables (i.e. variables sharing the same
information about the future of the system) are involved. Neural networks are

regions of a cold dense molecular cloud, to investigate two so far neglected
mechanisms of dust charging: collection of suprathermal CR electrons and
protons by grains, and photoelectric emission from grains due to the UV
radiation generated by CRs. The two mechanisms add to the conventional charging
by ambient plasma, produced in the cloud by CRs. We show that the CR-induced
photoemission can dramatically modify the charge distribution function for
submicron grains. We demonstrate the importance of the obtained results for
dust coagulation: While the charging by ambient plasma alone leads to a strong
Coulomb repulsion between grains and inhibits their further coagulation, the
combination with the photoemission provides optimum conditions for the growth
of large dust aggregates in a certain region of the cloud, corresponding to the
densities $n(\mathrm{H_2})$ between $\sim10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and $\sim10^6$
cm$^{-3}$. The charging effect of CR is of generic nature, and therefore is
expected to operate not only in dense molecular clouds but also in the upper
layers and the outer parts of protoplanetary discs.

through steel walls of cargo containers, trailer truck bodies, and train cars,
has been developed and demonstrated. The sensor is based on a new concept for
narrowband mechanical-impact acoustic transmitters and matched resonant
receivers. The lightweight, compact, and low-cost transmitters produce
high-power acoustic pulses at one or more discrete frequencies with little
input power. The energy for each pulse is accumulated over long times at low
powers, like a mousetrap, and therefore can be operated with ordinary batteries
and no power conditioning. A breadboard impact-transmitter and matched-receiver
system that detected human motion through thick walls with only rudimentary
signal processing is described, and results are presented. A conceptual design
is presented of an acoustic through-the-wall sensor, costing about $10,000 per
unit and capable of remotely and non-intrusively scanning steel cargo
containers for stowaways at a rate of two containers per minute. Advantages of
acoustic through-the-wall sensors over radar are: Sound penetrates metal walls;
and acoustic sensors are sensitive to small and slow motions, and so can detect
stationary persons by breathing motion alone. Other attractive features
include: high-resolution locating and tracking; portability; low cost; quick
and easy preparation and deployment; and near-real-time data processing and
display. These features provide a robust stand-alone through-the-wall
surveillance capability or an excellent complement to a radar sensor.
