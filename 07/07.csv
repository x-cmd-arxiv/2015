supersymmetric version of a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with a spin one
composite. The simplest version of the model as presented here has a single
chiral superfield (multiplet) with a four-superfield interaction. The latter
has the structure of the square of the superfield magnitude square. A vacuum
condensate of the latter is illustrated to develop giving rise to supersymmetry
breaking with a soft mass term for the superfield. We report also the effective
theory picture with a real superfield composite, illustrating the matching
effective potential analysis and the vacuum solution conditions for the
components. The nature of its fermionic part as the Goldstone mode is
presented. Phenomenological application to the supersymmetric standard model is
plausible.

abundances of a sample of observed red giants. The stellar models are
calculated from the zero-age main sequence till the early asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) phase. Stars of M $\leqslant$ $2.2$M$_{\odot}$ are evolved through
the core helium flash. In this work, an approach is adopted that improves the
mass determination of an observed sample of 21 RGB and early AGB stars. This
approach is based on comparing the observationally derived effective
temperatures and absolute magnitudes with the calculated values based on our
evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. A more reliable
determination of the stellar masses is achieved by using evolutionary tracks
extended to the range of observation. In addition, the predicted CNO surface
abundances are compared to the observationally inferred values in order to show
how far standard evolutionary calculation can be used to interpret available
observations and to illustrate the role of convective mixing. We find that
extra mixing beyond the convective boundary determined by the Schwarzschild
criterion is needed to explain the observational oxygen isotopic ratios in low
mass stars. The effect of recent determinations of proton capture reactions and
their uncertainties on the $^{16}$O$/^{17}$O and $^{14} $N$/^{15}$N ratios is
also shown. It is found that the $^{14}$N$($ p$,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction is
important for predicting the $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratio in red giants.

control, based on the TUC (Traffic responsive Urban Control) strategy. We
assume that the control is centralized as in the TUC strategy, but we introduce
a contention time window inside the cycle time, where antagonistic stages
alternate a priority rule. The priority rule is set by applying green colours
for given stages and yellow colours for antagonistic ones, in such a way that
the stages with green colour have priority over the ones with yellow colour.
The idea of introducing this time window is to reduce the red time inside the
cycle, and by that, increase the capacity of the network junctions. In
practice, the priority rule could be applied using vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) or
vehicle-to-infrastructure (v2i) communications. The vehicles having the
priority pass almost normally through the junction, while the others reduce
their speed and yield the way. We propose a model for the dynamics and the
control of such a system. The model is still formulated as a linear quadratic
problem, for which the feedback control law is calculated off-line, and applied
in real time. The model is implemented using the Simulation of Urban MObility
(SUMO) tool in a small regular (American-like) network configuration. The
results are presented and compared to the classical TUC strategy.

(type-I) X-ray bursts, which are powered by unstable nuclear burning of helium
and/or hydrogen into heavier elements deep in the NS ""ocean"". In some cases the
burning ashes may rise from the burning depths up to the NS photosphere by
convection, leading to the appearance of the metal absorption edges in the
spectra, which then force the emergent X-ray burst spectra to shift toward
lower energies. These effects may have a substantial impact on the color
correction factor $f_c$ and the dilution factor $w$, the parameters of the
diluted blackbody model $F_E \approx w B_E(f_c T_{eff})$ that is commonly used
to describe the emergent spectra from NSs. The aim of this paper is to quantify
how much the metal enrichment can change these factors. We have developed a new
NS atmosphere modeling code, which has a few important improvements compared to
our previous code required by inclusion of the metals. The opacities and the
internal partition functions (used in the ionization fraction calculations) are
now taken into account for all atomic species. In addition, the code is now
parallelized to counter the increased computational load. We compute a detailed
grid of atmosphere models with different exotic chemical compositions that
mimic the presence of the burning ashes. From the emerging model spectra we
compute the color correction factors $f_c$ and the dilution factors $w$ that
can then be compared to the observations. We find that the metals may change
$f_c$ by up to about 40%, which is enough to explain the scatter seen in the
blackbody radius measurements. The presented models open up the possibility for
determining NS mass and radii more accurately, and may also act as a tool to
probe the nuclear burning mechanisms of X-ray bursts.

without any light traces mass (LTM) assumption. The inferred power at small
scales tends to be larger if (i)~the cluster is at lower redshift, and/or
(ii)~there are deeper observations and hence more lensed images. In contrast,
lens reconstructions assuming LTM show higher power at small scales even with
fewer lensed images; it appears the small scale power in the LTM
reconstructions is dominated by light information, rather than the lensing
data. The average lensing derived $P_{\rm M}(k)$ shows lower power at small
scales as compared to that of simulated clusters at redshift zero, both
dark-matter only and hydrodynamical. The possible reasons are: (i)~the
available strong lensing data are limited in their effective spatial resolution

power they would have at $z\sim 0$, or (iii)~simulations are somehow
overestimating the small scale power.

content: a radiation fluid, a barotropic fluid to mimic the matter sector and a
single scalar field which can act as dark energy giving rise to the late-time
accelerated phase. Using the well-known dimensionless variables, we cast the
dynamical equations into an autonomous system of ordinary differential
equations (ASODE), which are studied by computing the fixed points and the
conditions for their stability. The matter fluid and the scalar field are taken
to be uncoupled at first and later, we consider a coupling between the two of
the form $Q = \sqrt{2/3}\kappa\beta\rho_m\dot{\phi}$ where $\rho_m$ is the
barotropic fluid density. The key point of our analysis is that for the closure
of ASODE, we only demand that the jerk, $\Gamma = V V""/V'^2$ is a function of
acceleration, $z = - M_p V'/ V$, that is, $\Gamma = 1+ f(z)$. In this way, we
are able to accommodate a large class of potentials that goes beyond the simple
exponential potentials. The analysis is completely generic and
\emph{independent} of the form of the potential for the scalar field. As an
illustration and confirmation of the analysis, we consider $f(z)$ of the forms
$\mu/z^2$, $\mu/z$, $(\mu-z)/z^2$ and $(\mu-z)$ to numerically compute the
evolution of cosmological parameters with and without coupling. Implications of
the approach and the results are discussed.

analytical form. This allows one to precisely determine Demon functional
thermodynamic operating regimes, when previous methods either misclassify or
simply fail due to approximations they invoke. This reveals that these Demons
are more functional than previous candidates. They too behave either as
engines, lifting a mass against gravity by extracting energy from a single heat
reservoir, or as Landauer erasers, consuming external work to remove
information from a sequence of binary symbols by decreasing their individual
uncertainty. Going beyond these, our Demon exhibits a new functionality that
erases bits not by simply decreasing individual-symbol uncertainty, but by
increasing inter-bit correlations (that is, by adding temporal order) while
increasing single-symbol uncertainty. In all cases, but especially in the new
erasure regime, exactly accounting for informational correlations leads to
tight bounds on Demon performance, expressed as a refined Second Law of
Thermodynamics that relies on the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy for dynamical
processes and not on changes purely in system configurational entropy, as
previously employed. We rigorously derive the refined Second Law under minimal
assumptions and so it applies quite broadly---for Demons with and without
memory and input sequences that are correlated or not. We note that general
Maxwellian Demons readily violate previously proposed, alternative such bounds,

more uncertainties in power systems. These uncertainties have to be
accommodated by flexible re- sources (i.e. upward and downward generation

proposed to price both the uncertainty and reserve. At the same time, the
energy is priced at Locational Marginal Price (LMP). A novel market clearing
mechanism is proposed to credit the gener- ation and reserve and to charge the

helps allocate the cost of generation reserves to uncertainty sources. We prove
that the proposed market clearing mechanism leads to partial market

addition to generation reserves for uncertainty accommodation. We prove that
transmission reserves for ramping delivery may lead to Financial Transmission
Right (FTR) underfunding in existing markets. The FTR underfunding can be
covered by congestion fund collected from uncertainty payment in the proposed

important objective of many educational and behavioral studies. Under the
potential outcomes framework, we can define causal effects as comparisons
between the potential outcomes under treatment and control. However,
unfortunately, the average causal effect, often the parameter of interest, is
difficult to interpret for ordinal outcomes. To address this challenge, we
propose to use two causal parameters, which are defined as the probabilities
that the treatment is beneficial and strictly beneficial for the experimental
units. However, although well-defined for any outcomes and of particular
interest for ordinal outcomes, the two aforementioned parameters depend on the
association between the potential outcomes, and are therefore not identifiable
from the observed data without additional assumptions. Echoing recent advances
in the econometrics and biostatistics literature, we present the sharp bounds
of the aforementioned causal parameters for ordinal outcomes, under fixed
marginal distributions of the potential outcomes. Because the causal estimands
and their corresponding sharp bounds are based on the potential outcomes
themselves, the proposed framework can be flexibly incorporated into any chosen
models of the potential outcomes, and are directly applicable to randomized
experiments, unconfounded observational studies, and randomized experiments
with noncompliance. We illustrate our methodology via numerical examples and
three real-life applications related to educational and behavioral research.

value problems on a class of non-compact manifolds with boundary (so-called Lie
manifolds with boundary). This is accomplished by constructing a suitable
generalization of the Boutet de Monvel calculus for boundary value problems.
The data consists of a compact manifold with corners $M$ that is endowed with a
Lie structure of vector fields $\mathcal{V}$, a so-called Lie manifold. The
manifold $M$ is split into two equal parts $X_{+}$ and $X_{-}$ which intersect
in an embedded hypersurface $Y \subset X_{\pm}$. Our goal is to describe a
transmission Boutet de Monvel calculus for boundary value problems compatible
with the structure of Lie manifolds. Starting with the example of $b$-vector
fields, we show that there are two groupoids integrating the Lie structures on
$M$ and on $Y$, respectively. These two groupoids form a bibundle (or a
groupoid correspondence) and, under some mild assumptions, these groupoids are
Morita equivalent. With the help of the bibundle structure and canonically
defined manifolds with corners, which are blow-ups in particular cases, we
define a class of Boutet de Monvel type operators. We then define the
representation homomorphism for these operators and show closedness under
composition with the help of a representation theorem. Finally, we consider
appropriate Fredholm conditions and construct the parametrices for elliptic
operators in the calculus.

powers in these active galaxies are traced by [OIII] emission-line and radio

luminosity and stellar mass measurements from the SDSS$-$MPA-JHU catalogue. In
the past, star formation studies of AGN have mostly focused on high-redshift
sources to observe the thermal dust emission that peaks in the far-infrared,
which limited the samples to powerful objects. However, with
$\textit{Herschel}$ we can expand this to low redshifts. Our stacking analyses
show that SFRs and SSFRs of both radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN increase with
increasing AGN power but that radio-loud AGN tend to have lower SFR.
Additionally, radio-quiet AGN are found to have approximately an order of
magnitude higher SSFRs than radio-loud AGN for a given level of AGN power. The
difference between the star formation properties of radio-loud and -quiet AGN
is also seen in samples matched in stellar mass.

symmetric cases. The Poisson structure of the remaining variables is not
canonical. Here we quantise this dynamics in an anisotropic minisuperspace
model via a natural extension of canonical quantisation. The resulting quantum
theory has no momentum representation. Instead the position basis takes a
fundamental role. We illustrate how the quantum theory and the modified

able to solve for the eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian. Finally we discuss how
far the results of this model extend to the general non-homogeneous case, in

using automatic processing act quickly and so are more likely to acquire
resources, but agents using controlled processing are better planners and so
make more effective use of the resources they have. Using the replicator
equation, we characterize the conditions under which automatic or controlled
agents dominate, when coexistence is possible, and when bistability occurs. We
then extend the replicator equation to consider feedback between the state of
the population and the environment. Under conditions where having a greater
proportion of controlled agents either enriches the environment or enhances the
competitive advantage of automatic agents, we find that limit cycles can occur,
leading to persistent oscillations in the population dynamics. Critically,
however, these limit cycles only emerge when feedback occurs on a sufficiently

blackbody. The standard model of cosmology predicts small spectral distortions
to this form, but no such distortion of the sky-averaged CMB spectrum has yet
been measured. We calculate the largest expected distortion, which arises from
the inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons off hot, free electrons, known as
the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. We show that the predicted signal
is roughly one order of magnitude below the current bound from the COBE-FIRAS
experiment, but can be detected at enormous significance ($\gtrsim 1000\sigma$)
by the proposed Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE). Although cosmic variance
reduces the effective signal-to-noise to $230\sigma$, this measurement will
still yield a sub-percent constraint on the total thermal energy of electrons
in the observable universe. Furthermore, we show that PIXIE can detect subtle
relativistic effects in the sky-averaged tSZ signal at $30\sigma$, which
directly probe moments of the optical depth-weighted intracluster medium
electron temperature distribution. These effects break the degeneracy between
the electron density and temperature in the mean tSZ signal, allowing a direct
inference of the mean baryon density at low redshift. Future spectral
distortion probes will thus determine the global thermodynamic properties of
ionized gas in the universe with unprecedented precision. These measurements
will impose a fundamental ""integral constraint"" on models of galaxy formation

essential as next-generation surveys enter the petabyte scale: data volumes
will exceed the capability of even large crowd-sourced analyses. We demonstrate
how a growing neural gas (GNG) can be used to encode the feature space of
imaging data. When coupled with a technique called hierarchical clustering,
imaging data can be automatically segmented and labelled by organising nodes in
the GNG. The key distinction of unsupervised learning is that these labels need
not be known prior to training, rather they are determined by the algorithm
itself. Importantly, after training a network can be be presented with images
it has never 'seen' before and provide consistent categorisation of features.
As a proof-of-concept we demonstrate application on data from the Hubble Space
Telescope Frontier Fields: images of clusters of galaxies containing a mixture
of galaxy types that would easily be recognised and classified by a human
inspector. By training the algorithm using one field (Abell 2744) and applying
the result to another (MACS0416.1-2403), we show how the algorithm can cleanly
separate image features that a human would associate with early and late type
galaxies. We suggest that the algorithm has potential as a tool in the
automatic analysis and data mining of next-generation imaging and spectral

scenarios. In MDM models, annihilation and co-annihilation processes among the
members of the MDM multiplet are usually very efficient, pushing the dark
matter mass above $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV in order to reproduce the observed dark
matter relic density. Motivated by this little drawback, in this paper we
consider an extension of the MDM scenario by three right-handed neutrinos. Two
specific choices for the MDM multiplet are studied: a fermionic $SU(2)_L$
quintuplet and a scalar $SU(2)_L$ septuplet. The lightest right-handed
neutrino, with tiny Yukawa couplings, never reaches thermal equilibrium in the
early universe and is produced by freeze-in. This creates a link between dark
matter and neutrino physics: dark matter can be non-thermally produced by the
decay of the lightest right-handed neutrino after freeze-out, allowing to lower
significantly the dark matter mass. We discuss the phenomenology of the
non-thermally produced MDM and, taking into account significant Sommerfeld
corrections, we find that the dark matter mass must have some specific values
in order not to be in conflict with the current bounds from gamma-ray

(by imposing to obtain the same iron abundance from FeI and FeII lines) the
[Fe/H] distribution spans ~0.5 dex, according to previous analyses. However,
the gravities obtained in this way correspond to unrealistic low stellar masses
(0.1-0.5 Msun) for most of the surveyed giants. Instead, when photometric
gravities are adopted, the [FeII/H] distribution shows no evidence of spread at
variance with the [FeI/H] distribution. This difference has been recently
observed in other clusters and could be due to non-local thermodynamical
equilibrium effects driven by over-ionization mechanisms, that mainly affect
the neutral species (thus providing lower [FeI/H]) but leave [FeII/H]
unaltered. We confirm that the s-process elements show significant star-to-star
variations and their abundances appear to be correlated with the difference
between [FeI/H] and [FeII/H]. This puzzling finding suggests that the peculiar
chemical composition of some cluster stars may be related to effects able to
spuriously decrease [FeI/H]. We conclude that M22 is a globular cluster with no
evidence of intrinsic iron spread, ruling out that it has retained the

merger trees from z=1.5 to z=0. We include the effects of the large hot gaseous
halo around all galaxies, following recent obervations and predictions of
galaxy formation models. We find that including the hot gaseous halo has a
number of important effects. Firstly, as expected, the star formation rate on
long timescales is increased due to cooling of the hot halo and refuelling of
the cold gas reservoir. Secondly, we find that interactions do not always
increase the SF in the long term. This is partially due to the orbiting
galaxies transferring gravitational energy to the hot gaseous haloes and
raising their temperature. Finally we find that the relative size of the
starburst, when including the hot halo, is much smaller than previous studies
showed. Our simulations also show that the order and timing of interactions are
important for the evolution of a galaxy. When multiple galaxies interact at the
same time, the SF enhancement is less than when galaxies interact in series.
All these effects show the importance of including hot gas and cosmologically
motivated merger trees in galaxy evolution models.

signature of quantumness in a broad range of phenomena encompassing many-body
physics, thermodynamics, cosmology, and life sciences. For arbitrary
multiparticle systems, entanglement quantification typically involves
nontrivial optimisation problems, and may require demanding tomographical
techniques. Here we develop an experimentally feasible approach to the
evaluation of geometric measures of multiparticle entanglement. Our approach
provides analytical results for particular classes of mixed states of N qubits,
and computable lower bounds to global, partial, or genuine multiparticle
entanglement of any general state. For global and partial entanglement, useful
bounds are obtained with minimum effort, requiring local measurements in just
three settings for any N. For genuine entanglement, a number of measurements
scaling linearly with N is required. We demonstrate the power of our approach
to estimate and quantify different types of multiparticle entanglement in a
variety of N-qubit states useful for quantum information processing and
recently engineered in laboratories with quantum optics and trapped ion setups.

rotating open strings in holographic backgrounds. Now we turn to closed
strings, which should be the duals of glueballs. We look at the rotating folded
closed string in both flat and curved backgrounds.
  A basic prediction of the closed string model is that the slope of Regge
trajectories is half that of open strings. We propose that a simple method to
identify glueballs is to look for resonances that belong to trajectories with a
slope of approximately 0.45 GeV^-2, half the meson slope. We therefore look at
the experimental spectra of flavorless light mesons to see if such a scheme,
where some of the states are placed on open string trajectories and some on
closed ones, can fit known experimental data. We look at the f_0 (J^PC = 0^++)
and f_2 (2^++) resonances. As there is no preference for a single scheme of
sorting the different states into meson and glueball trajectories, we present
several possibilities, each identifying a different state as the glueball. We
supplement each scheme with predictions for the masses of excited glueballs.
  We show that the width of the decay into two mesons is different for
glueballs and mesons thus providing a supplementary tool to distinguish between
them. In addition, we look at some lattice QCD results for glueball spectra and
check their compatibility with the closed string model.
  One of the main conclusions of this paper is that an extension of
experimental data on the spectrum of flavorless hadrons is needed, in
particular in the region between around 2.4 GeV and 3 GeV.

events with a peak > 10 MeV flux above 15 pfu are associated with a type II
burst and virtually all SEP events, 92%, are also associated with a type III
radio burst. Based on a principal component analysis, the radio burst
properties that are most highly correlated with the occurrence of gradual SEP
events and account for the most variance in the radio properties are the type
III burst intensity and duration. Further, a logistic regression analysis with
the radio-derived principal component (dominated by the type III and type II
radio burst intensity and type III duration) obtains SEP predictions
approaching the human forecaster rates, with a false alarm rate of 22%, a
probability of detection of 62%, and with 85% of the classifications correct.
Therefore, type III radio bursts that occur along with a DH type II burst are
shown to be an important diagnostic that can be used to forecast SEP events.

spectrum that are characteristic of the spin liquid phase. Unlike the dynamical
structure factor, which probes both the Majorana spinons and flux excitations
that emerge from spin fractionalization, the Raman spectrum in the Kitaev
models directly probes a density of states of pairs of fractional, dispersing
Majorana spinons. As a consequence, the Raman spectrum in all these models is
gapless for sufficiently isotropic couplings, with a low-energy power law that
results from the Fermi lines (or points) of the dispersing Majorana spinons. We
show that the polarization dependence of the Raman spectrum contains crucial
information about the symmetry of the ground state. We also discuss to what

the well-known outer dust belt, which, although patchy, is clearly resolved in
the radial direction, and (2) an unresolved source coincident with the position
of the star. We use direct model-fitting of the millimeter visibilities to
constrain the basic properties of these two components. A simple Gaussian shape
for the outer belt fit to the SMA data results in a radial location of
$64.4^{+2.4}_{-3.0}$ AU and FWHM of $20.2^{+6.0}_{-8.2}$ AU (fractional width

emission profile for the belt, though the power law index cannot be usefully
constrained. Within the noise obtained (0.2 mJy/beam), these data are
consistent with an axisymmetric belt model and show no significant azimuthal
structure that might be introduced by unseen planets in the system. These data
also limit any stellocentric offset of the belt to $<9$ AU, which disfavors the
presence of giant planets on highly eccentric ($>0.1$) and wide (10's of AU)
orbits. The flux density of the unresolved central component exceeds
predictions for the stellar photosphere at these long wavelengths, by a
marginally significant amount at 1.3 millimeters but by a factor of a few at 7

nuclei has to overcome the Coulomb barrier between these two nuclei to reach up
to the interacting region of nuclear force. We found nuclear fusion could be
realized with thermal vibrations of crystal lattice atoms coupling with light
atoms at low energy by resonance to overcome this Coulomb barrier. Thermal
resonances combining with tunnel effects can greatly enhance the probability of
the deuterium fusion to the detectable level. Our low energy nuclear fusion
mechanism research - thermal resonance fusion mechanism results demonstrate how
these light nuclei or atoms, such as deuterium, can be fused in the crystal of
metal, such as Ni or alloy, with synthetic thermal vibrations and resonances at
different modes and energies experimentally. The probability of tunnel effect
at different resonance energy given by the WKB method is shown that indicates
the thermal resonance fusion mode, especially combined with the tunnel effect,
is possible and feasible. But the penetrating probability decreases very
sharply when the input resonance energy decreases less than 3 keV, so for
thermal resonance fusion, the key point is to increase the resonance peak or
make the resonance sharp enough to the acceptable energy level by the suitable
compound catalysts, and it is better to reach up more than 3 keV to make the

a hierarchy of scales, relies on factorization. Cancellation of Glauber /
Coulomb gluons is a necessary condition for factorization. For Drell-Yan-like
processes, the known proofs of cancellation of Glauber gluons are not

possibility that a generalized factorization formalism is correct. To resolve
the questions, we construct a direct counter-example in QCD with scalar quarks,
contradicting any form of factorization in which the two collinear sectors are
decoupled from each other. In the counter-example, decoupling of the two
collinear sectors implies zero dependence of the beam thrust distribution on
the longitudinal spin of the incoming hadrons, but we find a non-zero spin
asymmetry at leading power due to Glauber gluons exchanged between spectators.

  Mismatches",,,"10.1109/TGRS.2016.2557340",,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dictionary-aided sparse regression (SR) approach has recently emerged as
a promising alternative to hyperspectral unmixing (HU) in remote sensing. By
using an available spectral library as a dictionary, the SR approach identifies
the underlying materials in a given hyperspectral image by selecting a small
subset of spectral samples in the dictionary to represent the whole image. A
drawback with the current SR developments is that an actual spectral signature
in the scene is often assumed to have zero mismatch with its corresponding
dictionary sample, and such an assumption is considered too ideal in practice.
In this paper, we tackle the spectral signature mismatch problem by proposing a
dictionary-adjusted nonconvex sparsity-encouraging regression (DANSER)
framework. The main idea is to incorporate dictionary correcting variables in
an SR formulation. A simple and low per-iteration complexity algorithm is
tailor-designed for practical realization of DANSER. Using the same dictionary
correcting idea, we also propose a robust subspace solution for dictionary
pruning. Extensive simulations and real-data experiments show that the proposed
method is effective in mitigating the undesirable spectral signature mismatch
effects.

provides both deterministically bounded staleness of data versions for each

investigate almost strong consistency in terms of 2-atomicity. Our 2AM

we decompose the so-called ""old-new inversion"" phenomenon into concurrency
patterns and read-write patterns, and propose a stochastic queueing model and a
""timed balls-into-bins model"" to analyze them, respectively. The theoretical
analysis not only demonstrates that ""old-new inversions"" rarely occur as
expected, but also reveals that the read-write pattern dominates in
guaranteeing such rare data inconsistencies. These are further confirmed by the
experimental results, showing that 2-atomicity is ""good enough"" in distributed

a diagram group if it is the fundamental group of a Squier complex. In this

we determine exactly when $S(\mathcal{P},w)$ is a special cube complex, as
defined by Haglund and Wise, so that the associated diagram group embeds into a
right-angled Artin group. A particular feature of Squier complexes is that the
intersections of hyperplanes are ""ordered"" by a relation $\prec$. As a strong
consequence on the geometry of $S(\mathcal{P},w)$, we deduce, in finite
dimensions, that its univeral cover isometrically embedds into a product of
finitely-many trees with respect to the combinatorial metrics; in particular,
we notice that (often) this allows to embed quasi-isometrically the associated
diagram group into a product of finitely-many trees. Finally, we exhibit a
class of hyperplanes inducing a decomposition of $S(\mathcal{P},w)$ as a graph
of spaces, and a fortiori a decomposition of the associated diagram group as a
graph of groups, giving a new method to compute presentations of diagram
groups. As an application, we associate a semigroup presentation
$\mathcal{P}(\Gamma)$ to any finite interval graph $\Gamma$, and we prove that
the diagram group associated to $\mathcal{P}(\Gamma)$ (for a given base word)

A notable observation is the dependence of nano-surface topology on
thermodynamic signatures of the carbon nanomaterials e.g., single wall carbon
nanotube (SWNT), multiwall carbon nanotube (MWNT) and graphene. The disruption
of the self assembly process while the micelles were converted to monomer has a
unique character in presence of graphene. This unique behavior follows
irrespective of whether the micelle forming monomer is anionic (Sodium dodecyl
sulfate) or cationic(Cetrimonium bromide). The direct measurement of
temperature(T) also indicates that T falls monotonically as the micelles are
formed in presence of graphene, this being different in all other cases (SWNT
and MWNT). The photon correlation studies indicated formation of smaller and
well distributed micelles in contact with graphene,this being not the case with
SWNT and MWNT. Importantly the free energy change corresponding to the micelle
formation has same order of magnitude (-26 to -25 KJ/Mole), the enthalpy
showing a nanosurface specific value that varies between -9 to +7 KJ /mole
depending on the nature of the nanomaterial and that of the self assembling
micellar monomer. The constancy of the free energy and surface dependent
vaiations of enthalpy implies that an entropy enthalpy compensation (free
energy being a linear combination of the two) is inevitable in the self
assembly process. The micellar cooling induced by graphene further implies a
possible potential of the nano-embedded self assembly in fields like energy
harnessing and bioenergetic manipulations. .

processing and pattern analysis. However, its potential for data compression
has not yet been fully investigated in the literature. In this paper, we
propose sparse low-rank matrix approximation (SLRMA), an effective
computational tool for data compression. SLRMA extends the conventional LRMA by
exploring both the intra- and inter-coherence of data samples simultaneously.
With the aid of prescribed orthogonal transforms (e.g., discrete cosine/wavelet
transform and graph transform), SLRMA decomposes a matrix into a product of two
smaller matrices, where one matrix is made of extremely sparse and orthogonal
column vectors, and the other consists of the transform coefficients.
Technically, we formulate SLRMA as a constrained optimization problem, i.e.,
minimizing the approximation error in the least-squares sense regularized by
$\ell_0$-norm and orthogonality, and solve it using the inexact augmented
Lagrangian multiplier method. Through extensive tests on real-world data, such
as 2D image sets and 3D dynamic meshes, we observe that (i) SLRMA empirically
converges well; (ii) SLRMA can produce approximation error comparable to LRMA
but in a much sparse form; (iii) SLRMA-based compression schemes significantly
outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of rate-distortion performance.

introduced as effective degrees of freedom of the dynamical sector. We explore
several theoretical constraints by investigating the scalar potential of the
model as well as the current bounds from the LHC and precision measurements. It
is found that the main decay modes are V' -> VV and V' -> Vh, and the V' width
is narrow enough so that the ATLAS diboson excess can be explained. In order to
investigate future prospects, we also perform collider simulations at the 13
TeV LHC, and obtain a model independent expected exclusion limit for the
process pp -> W' -> WZ -> JJ. We find a parameter space where the diboson
excess can be explained, and are within a reach of the LHC at the integrated
luminosity of 10 fb-1 and 13 TeV.

studied. The potential is responsible for peaks in the structure factor of the
liquid state at two different but comparable length scales, and a similar
bimodal structure is evident in the dispersion relation. Dynamical density
functional theory in two dimensions is used to identify two novel states of
this system, the crystal-liquid state, in which the majority of the particles
are located on lattice sites but a minority remains free and so behaves like a
liquid, and a 12-fold quasicrystalline state. Both are present even for deeply
quenched liquids and are found in a regime in which the liquid is unstable with
respect to modulations on the smaller scale only. As a result the system
initially evolves towards a small scale crystal state; this state is not a
minimum of the free energy, however, and so the system subsequently attempts to
reorganize to generate the lower energy larger scale crystals. This dynamical
process generates a disordered state with quasicrystalline domains, and takes
place even when this large scale is linearly stable, i.e., it is a nonlinear
process. With controlled initial conditions a perfect quasicrystal can form.
The results are corroborated using Brownian dynamics simulations.

outlier patterns. The basic idea behind detecting outlier patterns is
comparison of their relative frequencies with frequent patterns. Their
frequencies of appearance are less and thus have lesser support in the data.
Detecting outlier patterns is an important data mining task which will reveal
some interesting facts. The search for periodicity of patterns gives the
behavior of these patterns across time as to when they repeat likely. This in
turn helps in prediction of events. These patterns are found in Time
series-data, social networks etc. In this paper, an algorithm for periodic
outlier pattern detection is proposed with the usage of a Constraint Based FP
(Frequent Pattern)-tree as the underlying data structure for time series data.
The growth of the tree is limited by using level and monotonic constraints. The
protein sequence of bacteria named E.Coli is collected and periodic outlier
patterns in the sequence are identified. Further the enhancement of results is
obtained by finding the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) in defining candidate
outlier patterns. The comparative results between STNR-out (Suffix Tree Noise

can be simultaneously estimated at every node, and that they are clock-free. To
address the PageRank problem of time-varying graphs, we introduce the novel

most $f$ adjacent edges along a shortest path emanating from the source, and it
is recognized as one of the most frequent disruption in an SPT. We show that,
for any integer parameter $k \geq 1$, it is possible to provide a very sparse

approximates (i.e., within a stretch factor of $(2k-1)(2|F|+1)$) the true

many executions of a single program, TFLMs are trained on a corpus of
previously seen buggy programs, and learn to identify recurring patterns of
bugs. Widely-used fault localization techniques such as TARANTULA evaluate the
suspiciousness of each line in isolation; in contrast, a TFLM defines a joint
probability distribution over buggy indicator variables for each line. Joint
distributions with rich dependency structure are often computationally
intractable; TFLMs avoid this by exploiting recent developments in tractable
probabilistic models (specifically, Relational SPNs). Further, TFLMs can
incorporate additional sources of information, including coverage-based
features such as TARANTULA. We evaluate the fault localization performance of
TFLMs that include TARANTULA scores as features in the probabilistic model. Our

cellular systems. To compensate for the severe path loss in mmWave systems,
large antenna arrays are generally used to achieve significant beamforming
gains. However, due to the high hardware and power consumption cost associated
with radio frequency (RF) chains, it is desirable to achieve the large-antenna
gains, but with only limited number of RF chains for mmWave communications. To
this end, we study in this paper a new lens antenna array enabled mmWave MIMO
communication system. We first show that the array response of the proposed
lens antenna array at the receiver/transmitter follows a ""sinc"" function, where
the antenna with the peak response is determined by the angle of arrival
(AoA)/departure (AoD) of the received/transmitted signal. By exploiting this
unique property of lens antenna arrays along with the multi-path sparsity of
mmWave channels, we propose a novel low-cost and capacity-achieving MIMO
transmission scheme, termed \emph{orthogonal path division multiplexing
(OPDM)}. For channels with insufficiently separated AoAs and/or AoDs, we also
propose a simple \emph{path grouping} technique with group-based small-scale
MIMO processing to mitigate the inter-path interference. Numerical results are
provided to compare the performance of the proposed lens antenna arrays for
mmWave MIMO system against that of conventional arrays, under different
practical setups. It is shown that the proposed system achieves significant
throughput gain as well as complexity and hardware cost reduction, both making
it an appealing new paradigm for mmWave MIMO communications.

areas of exploring sustainability; software development experiences; credit &
incentives; reproducibility & reuse & sharing; and code testing & code review.
For each topic, the report includes a list of tangible actions that were
proposed and that would lead to potential change. The workshop recognized that
reliance on scientific software is pervasive in all areas of world-leading
research today. The workshop participants then proceeded to explore different
perspectives on the concept of sustainability. Key enablers and barriers of
sustainable scientific software were identified from their experiences. In
addition, recommendations with new requirements such as software credit files
and software prize frameworks were outlined for improving practices in
sustainable software engineering. There was also broad consensus that formal
training in software development or engineering was rare among the
practitioners. Significant strides need to be made in building a sense of
community via training in software and technical practices, on increasing their
size and scope, and on better integrating them directly into graduate education
programs. Finally, journals can define and publish policies to improve
reproducibility, whereas reviewers can insist that authors provide sufficient
information and access to data and software to allow them reproduce the results
in the paper. Hence a list of criteria is compiled for journals to provide to
reviewers so as to make it easier to review software submitted for publication

changing the relative importance of nodes in a given network, by exploiting the

near-periodic microstructure and of solute transport due to advection,
diffusion, and filter adsorption. In the second stage, we use the
computationally efficient homogenized equations to investigate and quantify why
porosity gradients can improve filter efficiency. We find that a porosity

investigate the dwarf galaxy population of the Virgo cluster beyond what has
previously been discovered. We initially mask and smooth the data, and then use
the object detection algorithm Sextractor to make our initial dwarf galaxy
selection. All candidates are then visually inspected to remove artefacts and
duplicates. We derive Sextractor parameters to best select low surface
brightness galaxies using g band central surface brightness values of 22.5 to
26.0 mag sq arc sec and exponential scale lengths of 3.0 - 10.0 arc sec to
identify 443 cluster dwarf galaxies - 303 of which are new detections. These
new detections have a surface density that decreases with radius from the
cluster centre. We also apply our selection algorithm to 'background',
non-cluster, fields and find zero detections. In combination, this leads us to
believe that we have isolated a cluster dwarf galaxy population. The range of
objects we are able to detect is limited because smaller scale sized galaxies
are confused with the background, while larger galaxies are split into numerous
smaller objects by the detection algorithm. Using data from previous surveys
combined with our data, we find a faint end slope to the luminosity function of
-1.35+/-0.03, which does not significantly differ to what has previously been
found for the Virgo cluster, but is a little steeper than the slope for field
galaxies. There is no evidence for a faint end slope steep enough to correspond
with galaxy formation models, unless those models invoke either strong feedback
processes or use warm dark matter.

model on a triangular lattice coupled to lattice vibration are analyzed by
applying the exact diagonalization method combined with the classical equation
of motion. A photo-induced phase transition from the horizontal stripe-type
charge order (CO) to the 3-fold CO occurs through a characteristic intermediate
time domain. By analyzing the time evolution in detail, we find that this
characteristic dynamics are seen when the electron and lattice sectors are not
complementary to each other but show cooperative time evolutions. We also find
that there are threshold values in the optical fluorescence and
electron-lattice coupling for emergence of the photo-induced 3-fold CO. The
dynamics are distinct from those from the vertical stripe-type CO, in which a
monotonic CO melting occurs. A scenario of the photo-induced CO phase
transition with lattice degree of freedom is presented from a view point of
charge frustration.

which are thought to be dominated by deep, global oceans. This results in the
formation of high-pressure water ice, separating the planetary crust from the
liquid ocean and, thus, also from the atmosphere. Therefore, instead of a
carbonate-silicate cycle like on the Earth, the atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentration is governed by the capability of the ocean to dissolve carbon
dioxide (CO2).
  In our study, we focus on the CO2 cycle between the atmosphere and the ocean
which determines the atmospheric CO2 content. The atmospheric amount of CO2 is
a fundamental quantity for assessing the potential habitability of the planet's
surface because of its strong greenhouse effect, which determines the planetary
surface temperature to a large degree. In contrast to the stabilising
carbonate-silicate cycle regulating the long-term CO2 inventory of the Earth
atmosphere, we find that the CO2 cycle feedback on ocean planets is negative
and has strong destabilising effects on the planetary climate. By using a
chemistry model for oceanic CO2 dissolution and an atmospheric model for
exoplanets, we show that the CO2 feedback cycle can severely limit the
extension of the habitable zone for ocean planets.

coefficients which are used to model negative index materials. Using the
reflecting technique introduced in \cite{Ng-Complementary}, we first derive
Cauchy problems from these equations. The limiting absorption principle and the
well-posedness are then obtained via various a priori estimates for these
Cauchy problems. There approaches are proposed to obtain the a priori
estimates. The first one follows from a priori estimates of elliptic systems
equipped general complementing boundary conditions due to Agmon, Douglis, and
Nirenberg in their classic work \cite{ADNII}. The second approach, which is
complement to the first one, is variational and based on the Dirichlet
principle. The last approach, which is complement to the second one, is also
variational and uses the multiplier technique. As a consequence, we obtain new
results on the well-posedness of these equations for which the positivity
conditions concerning the matrix-valued coefficients are imposed partially or
not strictly on the interface of sign changing coefficients. As a result, the
well-posedness can hold even in the case the contrast of the coefficients
across the sign changing interfaces is arbitrary. This allows us to rediscover
and extend largely known results obtained by the integral method, the pseudo
differential operator theory, and the T-coercivity approach. The unique
solution, obtained by the limiting absorption principle, is {\bf not} in

Along with conventional methods to study roll patterns and their stability, we

information (QFI) is a pivotal quantity, which depends on the state and its

property for the QFI in the sense that two close states with close first
derivatives have close QFIs. This property is completely general and
irrespective of dynamics or how states acquire their parameter dependence and
also the form of parameter dependence---indeed this continuity is basically a
feature of the classical Fisher information that in the case of the QFI
naturally carries over from the manifold of probability distributions onto the
manifold of density matrices. We demonstrate that in the special case where the
dependence of the states on the unknown parameter comes from one dynamical map
(quantum channel), the continuity holds in its reduced form with respect to the
initial states. In addition, we show that when one initial state evolves
through two different quantum channels, the continuity relation applies in its
general form. A situation in which such scenario can occur is an open-system
metrology where one of the maps represents the ideal dynamics whereas the other
map represents the real (noisy) dynamics. In the making of our main result, we
also introduce a regularized representation for the symmetric logarithmic

a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector by more than three orders of
magnitude. The DCR is limited by the blackbody radiation through a signal
passband of 20 nm bandwidth. The figure of merit, system detection efficiency,
and DCR were 2.7 x 10^11, 2.3 %, and 0.001 Hz, respectively. Narrowing the
bandwidth to 100 GHz suppresses the DCR to 0.0001 Hz and the figure of merit
increases to 1.8 x 10^12.

neutrinos. The scalar potential and the Yukawa couplings involving only
right-chiral neutrinos are invariant under a new global symmetry SU(3)$_N$ that
complements the standard U(1)$_{B-L}$ symmetry, and is broken explicitly only
by the Yukawa interaction, of order $10^{-6}$, coupling right-chiral neutrinos
and the electroweak lepton doublets. We point out four main advantages of this
enlargement, namely: (1) the economy of the (non-supersymmetric) Standard
Model, and thus its observational success, is preserved; (2) thanks to the
enlarged scalar sector the RG improved one-loop effective potential is
everywhere positive with a stable global minimum, thereby avoiding the
notorious instability of the Standard Model vacuum; (3) the pseudo-Goldstone
bosons resulting from spontaneous breaking of the SU(3)$_N$ symmetry are
natural Dark Matter candidates with calculable small masses and couplings; and
(4) the Majorana Yukawa coupling matrix acquires a form naturally adapted to
leptogenesis. The model is made perturbatively consistent up to the Planck
scale by imposing the vanishing of quadratic divergences at the Planck scale
(`softly broken conformal symmetry'). Observable consequences of the model
occur mainly via the mixing of the new scalars and the standard model Higgs
boson.

Spectral Efficiency (ASE) and the energy efficiency of UDNs with LOS/NLOS

for, the network suffers from low coverage and the ASE gain is lower than
linear at high base station densities. However, this performance drop can
partially be attenuated by means of frequency reuse, which is shown to improve
the ASE vs coverage trade-off of cell densification, provided that we have a
degree of freedom on the density of cells. In addition, from an energy
efficiency standpoint, cell densification is shown to be inefficient when both
LOS and NLOS components are taken into account. Overall, based on the findings
of our work that assumes a more advanced system model compared to the current

tridiagonal matrix, banded matrix or block-tridiagonal matrix and their
relationships with the covariance matrices of measurements of ordinary (simple)
Markov Random Processes (MRP), multiconnected MRP and vector MRP respectively.
Such covariance matrices are frequently occurring in the problems of optimal
filtering, extrapolation and interpolation of MRP and Markov Random Fields
(MRF). It is shown, that the structure of these three forms of matrices has the
same form, but the matrix elements in the first case are scalar quantities; in
the second case matrix elements representing a product of vectors of dimension
m; and in the third case, the off-diagonal elements are the product of matrices
and vectors of dimension m. The properties of such matrices were investigated
and a simple formulas of their inversion was founded. Also computational
efficiency in the storage and inverse of such matrices have been considered. To
illustrate the acquired results an example of the covariance matrix inversions
of two-dimensional MRP is given.

the weakness of the present cycle 24 are mainly caused by a number of bigger

performed in remote regions of a spatially spread entangled state to be higher

faster-than-light signaling. As a way out of this situation, it has been
hypothesized that the high quantum correlation can be observed only after a
time longer than L/c has elapsed (where L is the spatial spread of the
entangled state and c is the speed of light). In shorter times, a level of
correlation compatible with LR would be observed instead. A simple model
following this hypothesis is described. It has not been disproved by any of the
performed experiments to date. A test achievable with accessible means is
proposed. The data recorded in a similar but incomplete experiment (which was
done in 2012 with a different purpose, and repeated in 2018 producing

for an understanding of high-temperature superconductivity. In these cuprate
superconductors the magnetic excitation spectrum resembles an hour-glass and
certain resonant magnetic excitations within are believed to be connected to
the pairing mechanism which is corroborated by the observation of a universal
linear scaling of superconducting gap and magnetic resonance energy. So far,
charge stripes are widely believed to be involved in the physics of hour-glass
spectra. Here we study an isostructural cobaltate that also exhibits an
hour-glass magnetic spectrum. Instead of the expected charge stripe order we
observe nano phase separation and unravel a microscopically split origin of
hour-glass spectra on the nano scale pointing to a connection between the
magnetic resonance peak and the spin gap originating in islands of the
antiferromagnetic parent insulator. Our findings open new ways to theories of
magnetic excitations and superconductivity in cuprate superconductors.

superconductors (TSCs) based on ferromagnetic chains, measured by means of
spin-polarised scanning tunneling microscopy (SPSTM). Our analysis reveals
novel signatures of MFs arising from the interplay of their strongly
anisotropic spin-polarisation and the magnetisation content of the tip. We
focus on the deep Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) limit where only YSR bound states
localised in the vicinity of the adatoms govern the low-energy as also the
topological properties of the system. Under these conditions, we investigate
the occurence of zero/finite bias peaks (ZBPs/FBPs) for a single or two coupled
TSC chains forming a Josephson junction. Each TSC can host up to two Majorana
fermions (MFs) per edge if chiral symmetry is preserved. Here we retrieve the
conductance for all the accessible configurations of the MF number of each
chain. Our results illustrate innovative spin-polarisation-sensitive
experimental routes for arresting the MFs by either restoring or splitting the
ZBP in a predictable fashion via: i) weakly breaking chiral symmetry, e.g. by
the SPSTM tip itself or by an external Zeeman field and ii) tuning the
superconducting phase difference of the TSCs, which is encoded in the
4$\pi$-Josephson coupling of neighbouring MFs.

used, respectively, with the presence of a scalar field being taken into

the central singularity in neutral scalar collapse. Approximate analytic
expressions for different types of mass inflation are partially obtained via a
close interplay between numerical and analytical approaches and an examination
of the connections between Schwarzschild black holes, Reissner-Nordstrom black

the localness of the dynamics in strong gravity regions. This is in accord with
the Belinskii, Khalatnikov, and Lifshitz conjecture.

have an N-shaped equilibrium curve on the $\Sigma$-$\dot{M}$ plane (with
$\Sigma$ and $\dot{M}$ being surface density and mass accretion rate,
respectively). The accretion flow on the lower $\Sigma$ branch of the N-shape
is optically thick, advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) while that on the
upper one is neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF). The middle branch has a
negative slope on the $\Sigma$-$\dot{M}$ plane, meaning that the flow on this
branch is secularly unstable. To investigate how the instability affects the
flow structure and what observable signatures are produced, we study the time
evolution of the unstable hyperaccretion flow in response to variable mass
injection rates by solving the height-averaged equations for viscous accretion
flows. When a transition occurs from the lower branch to the upper branch (or
from the upper branch to the lower branch), the surface density rapidly
increases (decreases) around that transition region, which induces locally
enhanced mass flow (referred to as non-steady mass flow) into (out of) that
region. We confirm that the non-steady flow can create a kind of disturbance
and that it propagates over the whole disk. However, the non-steady mass flow
is not strong enough to induce coherent transition over the whole disk, unless
the mass injection rate varies with time. When the injection rate continuously
changes, the neutrino luminosity varies intermittently, thus producing
step-function-like light curves, as the radiation efficiency discontinuously
changes every time the local transition occurs. The effects of changing the
N-shape and possible observational consequences on the gamma-ray burst emission
are briefly discussed in relation to gamma-ray bursts.

outcomes are missing at random (MAR), Inverse Probability Weighted (IPW)
methods incorporating baseline covariates can be used to deal with informative
missingness. Also, augmented generalized estimating equations (AUG) correct for
imbalance in baseline covariates but need to be extended for MAR outcomes.
However, in the presence of interactions between treatment and baseline
covariates, neither method alone produces consistent estimates for the marginal
treatment effect if the model for interaction is not correctly specified. We
propose an AUG-IPW estimator that weights by the inverse of the probability of
being a complete case and allows different outcome models in each intervention
arm. This estimator is doubly robust (DR), it gives correct estimates whether
the missing data process or the outcome model is correctly specified. We
consider the problem of covariate interference which arises when the outcome of
an individual may depend on covariates of other individuals. When interfering
covariates are not modeled, the DR property prevents bias as long as covariate
interference is not present simultaneously for the outcome and the missingness.
An R package is developed implementing the proposed method. An extensive
simulation study and an application to a CRT of HIV risk reduction-intervention
in South Africa illustrate the method.

multiple types of relationships between a set of nodes. In such networks, each

set of information, community structure across layers can be collectively
utilized to discover and quantify underlying relational patterns between nodes.
To concisely extract information from a multilayer network, we propose to
identify and combine sets of layers with meaningful similarities in community
structure. In this paper, we describe the ""strata multilayer stochastic block
model'' (sMLSBM), a probabilistic model for multilayer community structure. The
central extension of the model is that there exist groups of layers, called
""strata'', which are defined such that all layers in a given stratum have
community structure described by a common stochastic block model (SBM). That
is, layers in a stratum exhibit similar node-to-community assignments and SBM
probability parameters. Fitting the sMLSBM to a multilayer network provides a
joint clustering that yields node-to-community and layer-to-stratum
assignments, which cooperatively aid one another during inference. We describe
an algorithm for separating layers into their appropriate strata and an
inference technique for estimating the SBM parameters for each stratum. We
demonstrate our method using synthetic networks and a multilayer network

analytic rate expression for temperatures about $1-5$~GK. This rate is valid
for both direct and sequential capture paths, and it only depends on the
three-body resonance energy. As a result the relevant path of the radiative
capture reactions can be determined. We present numerical results for $E1$ and
$E2$ photon emission, and discuss occurrence preferences in general as well as
relative sizes of these most likely processes. Finally, we present narrow
estimated intervals for the proton capture rates relevant for the critical

well resolved peaks over a wide array of data sets including cosine series with

atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_2}$ concentrations, tides, temperatures, sound

uses the rectangle method to compute the areas under the curve via complex
math. Results support the hypothesis that EI methods are more accurate than FFT
methods. Errors range from 5 to 10 times higher when determining peak frequency
by FFT, 1.4 to 60 times higher for peak amplitude, and 6 to 10 times higher for
phase under a peak. The ability to compute more accurate Fourier transforms has
promise for improved data analysis in many fields, including more sensitive
assessment of hypotheses in the environmental sciences related to
$\mathrm{CO_2}$ concentrations and temperature. Other methods are available to
address different weaknesses in FFTs; however, the EI method always produces

distributed optimization problem whose goal is to optimize a sum of convex
(cost) functions with real-valued scalar input/ouput. In this second part, we
introduce a condition-based variant of the original problem over arbitrary
directed graphs. Specifically, for a given collection of $k$ input functions
$h_1(x), \ldots, h_k(x)$, we consider the scenario when the local cost function
stored at agent $j$, denoted by $g_j(x)$, is formed as a convex combination of
the $k$ input functions $h_1(x), \ldots, h_k(x)$. The goal of this
condition-based problem is to generate an output that is an optimum of
$\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k h_i(x)$. Depending on the availability of side
information at each agent, two slightly different variants are considered. We
show that for a given graph, the problem can indeed be solved despite the
presence of faulty agents. In particular, even in the absence of side
information at each agent, when adequate redundancy is available in the optima
of input functions, a distributed algorithm is proposed in which each agent
carries minimal state across iterations.

variability that is suggested to be linked to stellar pulsations. Pulsational
activity in massive stars strongly depends on the star's evolutionary stage and
is assumed to be connected with mass-loss episodes, the appearance of
macroturbulent line broadening, and the formation of clumps in the wind. To
investigate a possible interplay between pulsations and mass-loss, we carried
out an observational campaign of the supergiant 55 Cyg over a period of five
years to search for photospheric activity and cyclic mass-loss variability in
the stellar wind. We modeled the H, He I, Si II and Si III lines using the
nonlocal thermal equilibrium atmosphere code FASTWIND and derived the
photospheric and wind parameters. In addition, we searched for variability in
the intensity and radial velocity of photospheric lines and performed a moment
analysis of the line profiles to derive frequencies and amplitudes of the
variations. The Halpha line varies with time in both intensity and shape,
displaying various types of profiles: P Cygni, pure emission, almost complete
absence, and double or multiple peaked. The star undergoes episodes of variable
mass-loss rates that change by a factor of 1.7-2 on different timescales. We
also observe changes in the ionization rate of Si II and determine a
multiperiodic oscillation in the He I absorption lines, with periods ranging
from a few hours to 22.5 days. We interpret the photospheric line variations in
terms of oscillations in p-, g-, and strange modes. We suggest that these
pulsations can lead to phases of enhanced mass loss. Furthermore, they can
mislead the determination of the stellar rotation. We classify the star as a
post-red supergiant, belonging to the group of alpha Cyg variables.

the luminosity. The aim of this paper is to derive outflow forces from outflows
of six intermediate mass protostellar regions and validate the apparent
correlation between total luminosity and outflow force seen in earlier work, as
well as remove uncertainties caused by different methodology. By comparing CO
6--5 observations obtained with APEX with non-LTE radiative transfer model
predictions, optical depths, temperatures, densities of the gas of the
molecular outflows are derived. Outflow forces, dynamical timescales and
kinetic luminosities are subsequently calculated. Outflow parameters, including
the forces, were derived for all sources. Temperatures in excess of 50 K were
found for all flows, in line with recent low-mass results. However, comparison
with other studies could not corroborate conclusions from earlier work on
intermediate mass protostars which hypothesized that fragmentation enhances
outflow forces in clustered intermediate mass star formation. Any enhancement
in comparison with the classical relation between outflow force and luminosity
can be attributed the use of a higher excitation line and improvement in
methods; They are in line with results from low-mass protostars using similar
techniques. The role of fragmentation on outflows is an important ingredient to
understand clustered star formation and the link between low and high-mass star
formation. However, detailed information on spatial scales of a few 100 AU,

condition $u(x)= \lambda x$ whenever $x$ belongs to the boundary of the domain
initially occupied by the material. In terms of the parameters of the models,
our analysis provides an explicit upper bound on those $\lambda>0$ such that
$I(u) \geq I(u_{\lambda})$ for all admissible $u$, where $u_{\lambda}$ is the
linear map $x \mapsto \lambda x$ applied across the entire domain. This is the
quasiconvexity condition referred to above.

mathematical model of collective motion under alignment and chemotaxis effect.
Starting from the paper by Di Costanzo et al (2015a), in which the Cucker-Smale
model (Cucker and Smale, 2007) was coupled with other cell mechanisms, to
describe the cell migration and self-organization in the zebrafish lateral line
primordium, we introduce a simplified model in which the coupling between an
alignment and chemotaxis mechanism acts on a system of interacting particles.
In particular we rely on a hybrid description in which the agents are discrete
entities, while the chemoattractant is considered as a continuous signal. The
proposed model is then studied both from an analytical and a numerical point of
view. From the analytic point of view we prove, globally in time, existence and
uniqueness of the solution. Then, the asymptotic behaviour of a linearised
version of the system is investigated. Through a suitable Lyapunov functional
we show that for $t\rightarrow +\infty$, the migrating aggregate exponentially
converges to a state in which all the particles have a same position with zero
velocity. Finally, we present a comparison between the analytical findings and
some numerical results, concerning the behaviour of the full nonlinear system.
