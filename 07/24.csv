In following E.P.Wigner the
terminus ""antilinear"" is used as it is standard in Physics. Mathematicians
prefer to say ""conjugate linear"". By restricting to finite-dimensional
complex-linear spaces, the exposition becomes elementary in the functional
analytic sense. Nevertheless it shows the amazing differences to the linear
case.
  Basics of antilinearity is explained in sections 2, 3,4, 7 and in subsection
1.2: Spectrum, canonical Hermitian form, antilinear rank one and two operators,
the Hermitian adjoint, classification of antilinear normal operators, (skew)
conjugations, involutions, and acq-lines, i.e. the antilinear counterparts of
1-parameter operator groups. Applications include the representation of the
Lagrangian Grassmannian by conjugations, its covering by acq-lines, as well as
results on equivalence relations. After remembering elementary Tomita-Takesaki
theory, antilinear maps, assiciated associated to a two-partite quantum system,
are defined. By allowing to write modular objects as twisted products of pairs
of them, they open some new ways to express EPR and teleportation tasks. The
appendix presents a look onto the rich structure of antilinear operator spaces.

The main advantages of this approximation are (i) the low cost associated with
the numerical treatment of the free surface of the modelled flows, (ii) exact
conservation of mass and (iii) the ability to compute 3D profiles of the
velocities in the directions along and normal to the slope. The derivation of
the model follows [14] and introduces a dimensional analysis based on the
shallow flow hypothesis. The proposed first order multilayer model fully
satisfies a dissipative energy equation. A comparison with an analytical
solution with a non-constant normal profile of the downslope velocity
demonstrates the accuracy of the numerical model. Finally, by comparing the
numerical results with experimental data, we show that the proposed multilayer
model with the $\mu(I)$-rheology reproduces qualitatively the effect of the
erodible bed on granular flow dynamics and deposits, such as the increase of
runout distance with increasing thickness of the erodible bed. We show that the
use of a constant friction coefficient in the multilayer model leads to the
opposite behaviour. This multilayer model captures the different normal
profiles of the downslope velocity during the different phases of the flow
(acceleration, stopping, etc.) including the presence of static and flowing
zones within the granular column.

shooting string energy loss of light quarks in the baryon dense plasma. We find
that the energy loss of heavy and light quarks generally displays a nontrivial,
fast-varying behavior as a function of the temperature near the crossover.
Moreover, energy loss is also found to generally increase due to nonzero baryon
density effects even though this strongly coupled liquid cannot be described in
terms of well defined quasiparticle excitations. Furthermore, to get a glimpse
of how thermalization occurs in a hot and baryon dense QGP, we study how the
lowest quasinormal mode of an external massless scalar disturbance in the bulk

that $u \in W^{1,2}$ satisfies a quaternionic del-bar equation. We work under
the assumption that $u$ is locally strongly approximable in $W^{1,2}$ by smooth
maps: then such maps are almost stationary harmonic (when $\mathcal{M}$ is
hyperK\""ahler as well, then stationary harmonic). We show that in this more

then address compactness issues for a weakly converging sequence $u_\ell

$u_\ell:\mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{N}$ with uniformly bounded Dirichlet energies.
The blow up analysis leads, as in the usual stationary setting, to the
existence of a rectifiable blow-up set $\Sigma$ of codimension $2$, away from
which the sequence converges strongly. The defect measure $\Theta(x)

using different transmission models. Two-domain approaches with sharp interface
conditions, e.g., of Beavers--Joseph--Saffman type, as well as a single-domain

pore-scale simulations, we use a highly scalable communication-reducing scheme
with a robust second order boundary handling. We comment on computational
aspects of the pore-scale simulation and on how to generate pore-scale

exact position of the interface, whereas a well-designed single-domain approach
can significantly better recover the averaged pore-scale results.

presenting a new learning framework that allows the learning of weak

from Ordered Answer Sets, generalises our previous work on learning ASP
programs without weak constraints, by considering a new notion of examples as
ordered pairs of partial answer sets that exemplify which answer sets of a
learned hypothesis (together with a given background knowledge) are preferred
to others. In this new learning task inductive solutions are searched within a
hypothesis space of normal rules, choice rules, and hard and weak constraints.
We propose a new algorithm, ILASP2, which is sound and complete with respect to
our new learning framework. We investigate its applicability to learning
preferences in an interview scheduling problem and also demonstrate that when
restricted to the task of learning ASP programs without weak constraints,
ILASP2 can be much more efficient than our previously proposed system.

temporal changes to the source conditions. The integral model is derived from
radial integration of the governing equations expressing the conservation of
mass, axial momentum and buoyancy. The non-uniform radial profiles of the axial
velocity and density deficit in the plume are explicitly described by shape
factors in the integral equations; the commonly-assumed top-hat profiles lead
to shape factors equal to unity. The resultant model is hyperbolic when the
momentum shape factor, determined from the radial profile of the mean axial
velocity, differs from unity. The solutions of the model when source conditions
are maintained at constant values retain the form of the well-established
steady plume solutions. We demonstrate that the inclusion of a momentum shape
factor that differs from unity leads to a well-posed integral model. Therefore,
our model does not exhibit the mathematical pathologies that appear in
previously proposed unsteady integral models of turbulent plumes. A stability
threshold for the value of the shape factor is identified, resulting in a range
of its values where the amplitude of small perturbations to the steady
solutions decay with distance from the source. The hyperbolic character of the
system allows the formation of discontinuities in the fields describing the
plume properties during the unsteady evolution. We compute numerical solutions
to illustrate the transient development following an abrupt change in the
source conditions. The adjustment to the new source conditions occurs through
the propagation of a pulse of fluid through the plume. The dynamics of this
pulse are described by a similarity solution and, by constructing this new
similarity solution, we identify three regimes in which the evolution of the
transient pulse following adjustment of the source qualitatively differ.

by single cosmic events in a two-phase LAr TPC employing a THGEM. An Andor iXon
Ultra 897 EMCCD camera was externally mounted via a borosilicate glass viewport
on the Liverpool two-phase LAr TPC. The camera successfully captured the
secondary scintillation light produced at the THGEM holes that had been induced
by cosmic events. The light collection capability of the camera for various
EMCCD gains was assessed. For a THGEM gain of 64 and an EMCCD gain of 1000,
clear images were captured with an average signal-to-noise ratio of 6.
Preliminary 3D reconstruction of straight cosmic muon tracks has been performed
by combining the camera images, PMT signals and THGEM charge data.
Reconstructed cosmic muon tracks were used to determine THGEM gain and to
calibrate the intensity levels of the EMCCD image.

regular $n$-colorings. A natural question is whether there exists a natural
bijection between regular $n$-colorings. We address this question using a
functorial formulation. Let $G$ be a simple graph. Then for each set $X$ we can
associate a set of $X$-colorings. This defines a functor, ""chromatic functor""
from the category of sets with injections to itself. The first main result
verifies that two finite graphs determine isomorphic chromatic functors if and
only if they have the same chromatic polynomial.
  Chromatic functors can be defined for arbitrary, possibly infinite, graphs.
This fact enables us to investigate functorial chromatic theory for infinite
graphs. We prove that chromatic functors satisfy the
Cantor-Bernstein-Schr\""oder property. We also prove that countable connected
trees determine isomorphic chromatic functors. Finally, we present a pair of
infinite graphs that determine non-isomorphic chromatic functors.

that it exhibits transient oscillatory behavior -- a phenomenon previously

weakly coupled systems described by the Boltzmann equation, these transient

  We derive [C/H]_dust from the Kramers-Kronig relation which relates the

the 2175 Angstrom bump. We also see that [C/H]_dust shows a trend of
correlating with 1/R_V, where R_V is the total-to-selective extinction ratio,

that high-energy photon production is sensitive to the assumed level of initial

for f-modes of rapidly rotating neutron stars. An approach different to the
previous studies is employed - first, the moment of inertia is used instead of
the stellar radius, and second, the normalization of the oscillation
frequencies and damping times is different. It was shown that in the
non-rotating case this can lead to a much stronger equation of state
independence and our goal is to generalize the static relations to the rapidly
rotating case and values of the spherical mode number $l\ge2$. We employ
realistic equations of state that cover a very large range of stiffness in
order to check better the universality of the relations. At the end we explore
the inverse problem, i.e. obtain the neutron star parameters from the observed
gravitational frequencies and damping times. It turns out that with this new
set of relations we can solve the inverse problem with a very good accuracy
using three frequencies that was not possible in the previous studies where one
needs also the damping times. The asteroseismology relations are also
particularly good for the massive rapidly rotating models that are subject to
secular instabilities.

keeps spurring the search and investigation of suitable sources of
entangled-photons. Semiconductor quantum dots are arguably the most attractive.
They can generate indistinguishable entangled-photons deterministically, and
are compatible with current photonic-integration technologies, a set of
properties not shared by any other entanglement resource. However, as no two
quantum dots are identical, they emit entangled-photons with random energies.
This hinders their exploitation in communication protocols requiring
entangled-states with well-defined energies. Here, we introduce scalable
quantum-dot-based sources of polarization-entangled-photons whose energy can be
controlled via dynamic strain-engineering without degrading the degree of
entanglement of the source. As a test-bench, we interface quantum dots with
clouds of atomic vapours, and we demonstrate slow-entangled-photons from a
single quantum emitter. These results pave the way towards the implementation
of hybrid quantum networks where entanglement is distributed among distant

scale applications are their super-linear computational requirements in terms
of the number of training samples. To address this issue, several approaches
that train SVMs on many small chunks of large data sets separately have been
proposed in the literature. So far, however, almost all these approaches have
only been empirically investigated. In addition, their motivation was always
based on computational requirements. In this work, we consider a localized SVM
approach based upon a partition of the input space. For this local SVM, we
derive a general oracle inequality. Then we apply this oracle inequality to
least squares regression using Gaussian kernels and deduce local learning rates
that are essentially minimax optimal under some standard smoothness assumptions
on the regression function. This gives the first motivation for using local
SVMs that is not based on computational requirements but on theoretical
predictions on the generalization performance. We further introduce a
data-dependent parameter selection method for our local SVM approach and show
that this method achieves the same learning rates as before. Finally, we
present some larger scale experiments for our localized SVM showing that it
achieves essentially the same test performance as a global SVM for a fraction
of the computational requirements. In addition, it turns out that the
computational requirements for the local SVMs are similar to those of a vanilla
random chunk approach, while the achieved test errors are significantly better.

increase in temperature under equilibrium conditions. We suggest that this
behavior results from the extremely low magnon group velocity that hinders a
change in the spin-spiral wavevector on these time scales.

Dirac fermions near certain (three) points of the surface Brillouin zone,

the conical Dirac dispersions of these surface states quench onto three sets of
Landau levels and we predict various possible hierarchies of incompressible

the ground state can display either a valley-polarized or a valley-coherent

two valley-polarized states is always discontinuous, while that between a
valley-polarized and a valley-coherent phase is continuous. The Zeeman
splitting and/or an applied uniaxial strain on the surface can drive the system
through various quantum phase transitions and place it in different
broken-symmetry phases. Application of uniaxial strain is also shown to
considerably modify the precise sequence of quantum Hall states. We also

caused by a general property of long-range interacting systems, which we name
""Cooperative Shielding"". It refers to shielded subspaces that emerge as the
system size increases and inside of which the evolution is unaffected by
long-range interactions for a long time. As a result, the dynamics strongly
depends on the initial state: if it belongs to a shielded subspace, the
spreading of perturbation satisfies the Lieb-Robinson bound and may even be
suppressed, while for initial states with components in various subspaces, the
propagation may be quasi-instantaneous. We establish an analogy between the
shielding effect and the onset of quantum Zeno subspaces. The derived effective
Zeno Hamiltonian successfully describes the short-ranged dynamics inside the
subspaces up to a time scale that increases with system size. Cooperative
Shielding can be tested in current experiments with trapped ions.

wide range of stellar masses and of evolutionary properties. We find that the

Keplerian rotation. By measuring the line flux ratios between vibrational

clearly distinct in excitation. The broad component ($\rm
FWHM=50-200\,km\,s^{-1}$) probes the disk region near the magnetospheric
accretion radius at $\approx0.05$ AU, where the gas is hot ($800-1500$ K). The
narrow component ($\rm FWHM=10-50 km\,s^{-1}$) probes the disk at larger radii

temperatures and orbital radii define an empirical temperature-radius relation
as a power law with index $-0.3\pm0.1$ between 0.05--3 AU. The broad CO
component, co-spatial with the observed orbital distribution of hot Jupiters,
is rarely detected in transitional and Herbig Ae disks, providing evidence for
an early dissipation of the innermost disk. An inversion in the temperature
profile beyond 3 AU is interpreted as a tracer of a regime dominated by UV
pumping in largely devoid inner disks, and may be a signature of the last stage

(p)reheating. Our approach is analogous to the Effective Field Theory of
Inflation, however here the inflaton oscillations provide an additional source
of (discrete) symmetry breaking. Using the Goldstone field that non-linearly
realizes time diffeormorphism invariance we construct a model independent
action for both the inflaton and reheating sectors. Utilizing the hierarchy of
scales present during the reheating process we are able to recover known
results in the literature in a simpler fashion, including the presence of
oscillations in the primordial power spectrum. We also construct a class of
models where the shift symmetry of the inflaton is preserved during reheating,
which helps alleviate past criticisms of (p)reheating in models of Natural
Inflation. Extensions of our framework suggest the possibility of analytically
investigating non-linear effects (such as rescattering and back-reaction)
during thermalization without resorting to lattice methods. By construction,
the EFT relates the strength of many of these interactions to other operators
in the theory, including those responsible for the efficiency of (p)reheating.
We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and challenges for our
approach.

substantial superconducting fluctuations, they do not drive the system into a

connected to the superconducting regime by a continuous phase transition. These

indicate a sub milli-arc-second (mas) precision in the positions and the
presence of semi-periodic systematics with a mean amplitude of ~0.8 mas. We
combined these observations with numerous archival images taken with WFPC2 and
spanning 17 years. The precision of the resulting proper motions for
well-measured stars around the massive cluster R 136 can be as good as ~20
microarcsec/yr, although the true accuracy of proper motions is generally lower
due to the residual systematic errors. The observed proper-motion dispersion
for our highest-quality measurements is ~0.1 mas/yr. Our catalog of positions
and proper motions contains 86,590 stars down to V~25 and over a total area of
~70 square arcmin. We examined the proper motions of 105 relatively bright

neutrinos with the primordial plasma and their effect on the resonant
production of sterile neutrino dark matter. Motivated by issues in cosmological
structure formation on small scales, and reported X-ray signals that could be
due to sterile neutrino decay, we consider $7$ keV-scale sterile neutrinos.
Oscillation-driven production of such sterile neutrinos occurs at temperatures
$T \gtrsim 100$ MeV, where we study two significant effects of weakly charged
species in the primordial plasma: (1) the redistribution of an input lepton
asymmetry; (2) the opacity for active neutrinos. We calculate the
redistribution analytically above and below the quark-hadron transition, and
match with lattice QCD calculations through the transition. We estimate
opacities due to tree level processes involving leptons and quarks above the
quark-hadron transition, and the most important mesons below the transition. We
report final sterile neutrino dark matter phase space densities that are
significantly influenced by these effects, and yet relatively robust to
remaining uncertainties in the nature of the quark-hadron transition. We also
provide transfer functions for cosmological density fluctuations with cutoffs
at $k \simeq 10 \ h \ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, that are relevant to galactic structure
formation.

to ZZ to 4 lepton events using data recorded by the CMS experiment during the
LHC run 1 with an integrated luminosity of 5.1 and 19.7 inverse femtobarns at a
center-of-mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. The measurement of the
Higgs boson lifetime is derived from its flight distance in the CMS detector
with an upper bound of tau[H] < 1.9E-13 s at the 95% confidence level (CL),
corresponding to a lower bound on the width of Gamma[H] > 3.5E-9 MeV. The
measurement of the width is obtained from an off-shell production technique,
generalized to include anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson to two
electroweak bosons. From this measurement, a joint constraint is set on the
Higgs boson width and a parameter f[LQ] that expresses an anomalous coupling
contribution as an on-shell cross-section fraction. The limit on the Higgs
boson width is Gamma[H] < 46 MeV with f[LQ] unconstrained and Gamma[H] < 26 MeV
for f[LQ] = 0 at the 95% CL. The constraint f[LQ] < 3.8E-3 at the 95% CL is
obtained for the expected standard model Higgs boson width.

distribution and color profile for each galaxy using the median colors of stars
in the RGB. Within each galaxy we find variations in the median colors as a
function of radius which likely indicates population variations, reflecting
that their outskirts were built from several small accreted objects. We find
that half of the galaxies (NGC 0891, NGC 4565, and NGC 7814) present a clear
negative color gradient, reflecting a declining metallicity in their halos; the
other have no significant color or population gradient. In addition,
notwithstanding the modest sample size of galaxies, there is no strong
correlation between their halo color/metallicity or gradient with galaxy's
properties such as rotational velocity or stellar mass. The diversity in halo
color profiles observed in the GHOSTS galaxies qualitatively supports the
predicted galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in halo stellar properties; a consequence of
the stochasticity inherent in the assembling history of galaxies.

These can, however, only be probed through simultaneous observations at several

uninterrupted observations from 2015 June 20$^{\mathrm{th}}$, 15:50 UTC to June
25$^{\mathrm{th}}$, 4:05 UTC, from the optical V-band, up to the soft
$\gamma$-rays. V404 Cyg was extremely variable in all bands, with the detection
of 18 flares with fluxes exceeding 6 Crab (20--40 keV) within 3 days. The flare
recurrence can be as short as $\sim$ 20~min from peak to peak. A
model-independent analysis shows that the $>$6 Crab flares have a hard
spectrum. A simple 10--400 keV spectral analysis of the off-flare and flare
periods shows that the variation in intensity is likely to be due to variations
of a cut-off power law component only. The optical flares seem to be at least
of two different types: one occurring in simultaneity with the X-ray flares,
the other showing a delay greater than 10 min. The former could be associated
with X-ray reprocessing by either an accretion disk or the companion star. We
suggest that the latter are associated with plasma ejections that have also
been seen in radio.

aperture-synthesis imaging combining the NACO speckle data and AMBER data
(2.2--2.29 micron) with a spatial resolution of 5.6x7.3 mas further resolves
not only this elongated component, but also the central star. The reconstructed
image reveals that the elongated component is a nearly edge-on disk with a size
of ~180x50 mas lying in the E-W direction, and furthermore, that the southern
hemisphere of the central star is severely obscured by the equatorial dust lane
of the disk. The angular size of the disk is consistent with the distance that
the dust clouds that were ejected at the onset of the dimming event should have
traveled by the time of our observations, if we assume that the dust clouds
moved radially. This implies that the formation of the disk may be responsible
for the dimming event. The 8.7 micron image with a spatial resolution of 220
mas extracted from the MIDI data taken in 2004 (seven years before the AMBER

  More precisely, the Lie algebra of special derivations of a commutative
algebra always satisfy the standard Lie identity of degree $5$.
  The problem of existence of such embedding is a long-standing problem (see

of star formation. In this framework large, self gravitating, turbulent clouds
fragment into smaller clouds which in turn fragment into even smaller ones. At
the end of this cascade we find the clouds which collapse into protostars.
Following this process is extremely challenging numerically due to the large
dynamical range so in this paper we propose a semi analytic framework which is
able to follow star formation from the largest, giant molecular cloud (GMC)
scale, to the final protostellar size scale. Due to the simplicity of the
framework it is ideal for theoretical experimentation to explore the principal
processes behind different aspects of star formation, at the cost of strong
assumptions. The basic version of the model discussed in this paper only
contains turbulence, gravity and crude assumptions about feedback, nevertheless
it can reproduce the observed core mass function (CMF) and provide the
protostellar system mass function (PSMF), which shows a striking resemblance to
the observed IMF. Furthermore we find that to produce a universal IMF
protostellar feedback must be taken into account otherwise the PSMF peak shows
a strong dependence on the background temperature.

Ba{0.39(1)}Rb{0.61(1)}Mn2As2 below its Curie temperature TC = 103(2) K is
reported. The magnetization M versus applied magnetic field H isotherm data at
1.8 K show complete polarization of the itinerant doped-hole magnetic moments
that are introduced by substituting Rb for Ba. The material exhibits extremely
soft FM, with unobservably small remanent magnetization and coercive field.
Surprisingly, and contrary to typical itinerant FMs, the M(H) data follow the
Arrott-plot paradigm that is based on a mean-field theory of local-moment FMs.
The in-plane electrical resistivity data are fitted well by an activated-T^2
expression for T < TC, whereas the data sharply deviate from this model for T >
TC. Hence the activated-T^2 resistivity model is an excellent diagnostic for
determining the onset of half-metallic FM in this compound, which in turn
demonstrates the presence of a strong correlation between the electronic
transport and magnetic properties of the material. Together with previous data
on 40% hole-doped Ba{0.6}K{0.4}Mn2As2, these measurements establish 61%-doped
Ba{0.39}Rb{0.61}Mn2As2 as a prototype for a new class of half-metallic

objects (SO). Such descriptions preserve more detailed information about units
and their clusters than the usual representations with mean values. A special
kind of symbolic object is a representation with frequency or probability
distributions (modal values). This representation enables us to consider in the
clustering process the variables of all measurement types at the same time. In
the paper a clustering criterion function for SOs is proposed such that the
representative of each cluster is again composed of distributions of variables'
values over the cluster. The corresponding leaders clustering method is based
on this result. It is also shown that for the corresponding agglomerative
hierarchical method a generalized Ward's formula holds. Both methods are
compatible - they are solving the same clustering optimization problem. The
leaders method efficiently solves clustering problems with large number of
units; while the agglomerative method can be applied alone on the smaller data
set, or it could be applied on leaders, obtained with compatible
nonhierarchical clustering method. Such a combination of two compatible methods
enables us to decide upon the right number of clusters on the basis of the
corresponding dendrogram. The proposed methods were applied on different data
sets. In the paper, some results of clustering of ESS data are presented.

observed relationship between log(C/M) and stellar metallicity, which is fully
consistent with the trend seen across Local Group satellite galaxies. The fact
that this trend persists in stellar populations with very different star

paper we consider the scenario when Maker plays randomly and Breaker is
""clever"", and determine the sharp threshold bias of classical graph games, such
as connectivity, Hamiltonicity, and minimum degree-$k$. We treat the other
case, that is when Breaker plays randomly, in a separate paper. The
traditional, deterministic version of these games, with two optimal players
playing, are known to obey the so-called probabilistic intuition. That is, the
threshold bias of these games is asymptotically equal to the threshold bias of
their random counterpart, where players just take edges uniformly at random. We
find, that despite this remarkably precise agreement of the results of the
deterministic and the random games, playing randomly against an optimal
opponent is not a good idea: the threshold bias becomes significantly more
tilted towards the random player. An important qualitative aspect of the
probabilistic intuition carries through nevertheless: the bottleneck for Maker
to occupy a connected graph is still the ability to avoid isolated vertices in
her graph.

E July 23, 2015",,,,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Billiard systems offer a simple setting to study regular and chaotic
dynamics. Gravitational billiards are generalizations of these classical
billiards which are amenable to both analytical and experimental
investigations. Most previous work on gravitational billiards has been
concerned with two dimensional boundaries. In particular the case of linear
boundaries, also known as the wedge billiard, has been widely studied. In this
work, we introduce a three dimensional version of the wedge; that is, we study
the nonlinear dynamics of a billiard in a constant gravitational field
colliding elastically with a linear cone of half angle $\theta$. We derive a
two-dimensional Poincar\'{e} map with two parameters, the half angle of the
cone and $\ell$, the $z$-component of the billiard's angular momentum. Although
this map is sufficient to determine the future motion of the billiard, the
three-dimensional nature of the physical trajectory means that a periodic orbit
of the mapping does not always correspond to a periodic trajectory in
coordinate space. We demonstrate several integrable cases of the parameter
values, and analytically compute the system's fixed point, analyzing the
stability of this orbit as a function of the parameters as well as its relation
to the physical trajectory of the billiard. Next, we explore the phase space of
the system numerically. We find that for small values of $\ell$ the conic
billiard exhibits behavior characteristic of two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian
systems with a discontinuity, and the dynamics is qualitatively similar to that
of the wedge billiard, although the correspondence is not exact. As we increase
$\ell$ the dynamics becomes on the whole less chaotic, and the correspondence
with the wedge billiard is lost.

phenomena. We explore these convection dynamics for a range of white dwarf core
and helium shell masses in three dimensions using the low Mach number
hydrodynamics code Maestro. We present calculations of the bulk properties of
this evolution, including time-series evolution of global diagnostics, lateral
averages of the 3D state, and the global 3D state. We find a variety of
outcomes including quasi-equilibrium, localized runaway, and nova-like runaway.

3D, dynamic convection plays a key role, and that these systems warrant further

In all cases the lowest threshold is achieved near the end of the Brillouin

early PT symmetry breaking is observed and shown to be caused by the presence
of termination states localized at the edges of the finite chain resulting in
localized lasing and dissipative modes at each end of the chain.

as modeling dynamic scenes or shape deformations, where the visual scene or the
deformed objects can be modeled by a manifold. The proposed framework is
nonparametric and uses the heat kernel (and its associated Brownian motion) on
manifolds as an averaging procedure. It directly generalizes the use of the
Gaussian kernel (as a natural model of additive noise) in vector-valued
regression problems. In order to avoid explicit dependence on estimates of the
heat kernel, we follow a Bayesian setting, where Brownian motion on $M$ induces
a prior distribution on the space of continuous functions $C([0,1], M)$. For
the case of discretized Brownian motion, we establish the consistency of the
posterior distribution in terms of the $L_{q}$ distances for any $1 \leq q <

$O(n^{-1/4+\epsilon})$ for any fixed $\epsilon>0$, where $n$ is the number of

Super-Kamiokande limit of \tau_p \gtrsim 1.29 \times 10^{34} yrs. With the help

suitable dark matter candidate while also solving the strong CP problem. The
intermediate scale, M_I \approx (10^{13}-10^{14}) GeV which is also the B-L

collective behaviors such as pattern formation and phase separation in both
biologica and synthetic systems. While these behaviors are increasingly well
understood for ensembles of linearly self-propelled particles, less is known
about the collective behaviors of active rotating particles where energy input
at the particle level gives rise to rotational particle motion. A recent
simulation study revealed that active rotation can induce phase separation in
mixtures of counter-rotating particles in 2D. In contrast to that of linearly
self-propelled particles, the phase separation of counter-rotating fluids is
accompanied by steady convective flows that originate at the fluid-fluid
interface. Here, we investigate the influence of these flows on the coarsening
dynamics of actively rotating binary liquids using a phenomenological,
hydrodynamic model that combines a Cahn-Hilliard equation for the fluid
composition with a Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid velocity. The effect of
active rotation is introduced though an additional force within the
Navier-Stokes equations that arises due to gradients in the concentrations of
clockwise and counter-clockwise rotating particles. Depending on the strength
of active rotation and that of frictional interactions with the stationary
surroundings, we observe and explain new dynamical behaviors such as ""active
coarsening"" via self-generated flows as well as the emergence of self-propelled
vortex doublets. We confirm that many of the qualitative behaviors identified
by the continuum model can also be found in discrete, particle-based
simulations of actively rotating liquids. Our results highlight further
opportunities for achieving complex dissipative structures in active materials
subject to distributed actuation.

stratified sampling (SS) designs referred to as partially stratified sample
(PSS) designs. True SS and LHS are shown to represent the extremes of the PSS
spectrum. The variance of PSS estimates is derived along with some asymptotic
properties. PSS designs are shown to reduce variance associated with variable
interactions, whereas LHS reduces variance associated with main effects.
Challenges associated with the use of PSS designs and their limitations are
discussed. To overcome these challenges, the PSS method is coupled with a new
method called Latinized stratified sampling (LSS) that produces sample sets
that are simultaneously SS and LHS. The LSS method is equivalent to an
Orthogonal Array based LHS under certain conditions but is easier to obtain.
Utilizing an LSS on the subspaces of a PSS provides a sampling strategy that
reduces variance associated with both main effects and variable interactions
and can be designed specially to minimize variance for a given problem. Several
high-dimensional numerical examples highlight the strengths and limitations of
the method. The Latinized partially stratified sampling method is then applied
to identify the best sample strategy for uncertainty quantification on a plate

correlation for the double n/p and isoscaling p/p yield ratios. By combining
data and simulations at different beam energies, it should be possible to place
constraints on the slope of symmetry energy (L) and effective mass splitting

$W^\pm W^\pm$ fusion at LHC13. The signal will be a pair of same-sign leptons
($e$ or $\mu$) in events with two relatively forward, hemispherically-separated
jets with a large rapidity gap. We find that even though the higgsinos have a
full-strength $SU(2)$ gauge couplings to $W$-bosons, the LHC13 cross section
for the production of same sign higgsino pairs is smaller than 0.02 fb over
most of the interesting range of natural SUSY parameters, even before leptonic
branching fractions of the chargino are included. This cross section is
strongly suppressed because the two neutral Majorana higgsinos can be combined
into a single Dirac neutralino if the bino and the winos are much heavier than
the higgsinos, as is the case in natural SUSY models: in this limit, higgsino
couplings to $W$-bosons exhibit an emergent (approximate) $U(1)_{\rm ino}$
global symmetry that suppresses same sign higgsino production by vector boson
fusion. We conclude that this channel is not a viable way to search for natural
SUSY even at the high luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider.

the zero-field nonsecular magnetic dipolar interaction effect, with an emphasis
on magnetization dynamics in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate under the single

nature of the dipolar interaction, a novel resonance occurs in the condensate
magnetization oscillation, contrast to the previous assumption of a conserved

measurements $m$ required to achieve robust weighted sparse recovery guarantees
in terms of how well a given prior model for the sparsity support aligns with
the true underlying support. Our main contribution is that for a sparse vector
${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ supported on an unknown set $\mathcal{S} \subset
\{1, \dots, N\}$ with $|\mathcal{S}|\leq k$, if $\mathcal{S}$ has
\emph{weighted cardinality} $\omega(\mathcal{S}) := \sum_{j \in \mathcal{S}}
\omega_j^2$, and if the weights on $\mathcal{S}^c$ exhibit mild growth,
$\omega_j^2 \geq \gamma \log(j/\omega(\mathcal{S}))$ for $j\in\mathcal{S}^c$
and $\gamma > 0$, then the sample complexity for sparse recovery via weighted
$\ell_1$-minimization using weights $\omega_j$ is linear in the weighted
sparsity level, and $m = \mathcal{O}(\omega(\mathcal{S})/\gamma)$. This main
result is a generalization of special cases including a) the standard sparse
recovery setting where all weights $\omega_j \equiv 1$, and $m =
\mathcal{O}\left(k\log\left(N/k\right)\right)$; b) the setting where the
support is known a priori, and $m = \mathcal{O}(k)$; and c) the setting of
sparse recovery with prior information, and $m$ depends on how well the weights
are aligned with the support set $\mathcal{S}$. We further extend the results
in case c) to the setting of additive noise. Our results are {\em nonuniform}
that is they apply for a fixed support, unknown a priori, and the weights on
$\mathcal{S}$ do not all have to be smaller than the weights on $\mathcal{S}^c$

the two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ICCR with delayed feedback

such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, in which thousands of clients subscribe
a common content provider (e.g., a popular singer) and download his/her content
updates all the time. Offloading such traffic through complementary networks,
such as a delay tolerant network formed by device-to-device (D2D)
communications between mobile subscribers, is a promising solution to reduce
the cellular burdens. In the existing solutions, mobile users are assumed to be
volunteers who selfishlessly deliver the content to every other user in
proximity while moving. However, practical users are selfish and they will
evaluate their individual payoffs in the D2D sharing process, which may highly
influence the network performance compared to the case of selfishless users. In
this paper, we take user selfishness into consideration and propose a network
formation game to capture the dynamic characteristics of selfish behaviors. In
the proposed game, we provide the utility function of each user and specify the
conditions under which the subscribers are guaranteed to converge to a stable
network. Then, we propose a practical network formation algorithm in which the
users can decide their D2D sharing strategies based on their historical
records. Simulation results show that user selfishness can highly degrade the
efficiency of data offloading, compared with ideal volunteer users. Also, the
decrease caused by user selfishness can be highly affected by the cost ratio
between the cellular transmission and D2D transmission, the access delays, and
mobility patterns.

The energy range covered by this analysis, from ~350 GeV to ~2 TeV, allows the
connection of the region explored by Fermi with the multi-TeV measurements
carried out by Milagro. Our analysis has been focused on two selected regions
of the Galactic plane, i.e., 40{\deg} < l < 100{\deg} and 65{\deg} < l <
85{\deg} (the Cygnus region), where Milagro observed an excess with respect to
the predictions of current models. Great care has been taken in order to mask
the most intense gamma-ray sources, including the TeV counterpart of the Cygnus
cocoon recently identified by ARGO-YBJ, and to remove residual contributions.
The ARGO-YBJ results do not show any excess at sub-TeV energies corresponding
to the excess found by Milagro, and are consistent with the predictions of the

hindered not only by the usual difficulties encountered in UQ tasks (e.g. the
high computational cost of each forward simulation, the large number of random

involving large numbers of design variables and potentially constraints. We
propose a framework that is suitable for a large class of such problems and is

low-dimensional set of directions in the design space, along which, the
objective exhibits the largest sensitivity.

In all cases considered the cost of the computations in terms of calls to the

outliers. The problem of outlier detection is to find a small number of
instances that are apparently distant from the remaining instances. On the
other hand, the objective of differential privacy is to conceal presence (or
absence) of any particular instance. Outlier detection and privacy protection
are thus intrinsically conflicting tasks. In this paper, instead of reporting
outliers detected, we present two types of differentially private queries that
help to understand behavior of outliers. One is the query to count outliers,
which reports the number of outliers that appear in a given subspace. Our
formal analysis on the exact global sensitivity of outlier counts reveals that
regular global sensitivity based method can make the outputs too noisy,
particularly when the dimensionality of the given subspace is high. Noting that
the counts of outliers are typically expected to be relatively small compared
to the number of data, we introduce a mechanism based on the smooth upper bound
of the local sensitivity. The other is the query to discovery top-$h$ subspaces
containing a large number of outliers. This task can be naively achieved by
issuing count queries to each subspace in turn. However, the variation of
subspaces can grow exponentially in the data dimensionality. This can cause
serious consumption of the privacy budget. For this task, we propose an
exponential mechanism with a customized score function for subspace discovery.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first trial to ensure
differential privacy for distance-based outlier analysis. We demonstrated our
methods with synthesized datasets and real datasets. The experimental results
show that out method achieve better utility compared to the global sensitivity
based methods.

free energy landscapes, and due to its self-guiding property, the method has
been successful in studying complex reactions and conformational changes. MTD
sampling is based on filling the free energy basins by biasing potentials and
thus for cases with flat, broad and unbound free energy wells, the
computational time to sample them becomes very large. To alleviate this
problem, we combine the standard Umbrella Sampling (US) technique with MTD to
sample orthogonal collective variables (CVs) in a simultaneous way. Within this
scheme, we construct the equilibrium distribution of CVs from biased
distributions obtained from independent MTD simulations with umbrella
potentials. Reweighting is carried out by a procedure that combines US
reweighting and Tiwary-Parrinello MTD reweighting within the Weighted Histogram
Analysis Method (WHAM). The approach is ideal for a controlled sampling of a CV
in a MTD simulation, making it computationally efficient in sampling flat,
broad and unbound free energy surfaces. This technique also allows for a
distributed sampling of a high-dimensional free energy surface, further
increasing the computational efficiency in sampling. We demonstrate the
application of this technique in sampling high-dimensional surface for various
chemical reactions using ab initio and QM/MM hybrid molecular dynamics
simulations. Further, in order to carry out MTD bias reweighting for computing
forward reaction barriers in ab initio or QM/MM simulations, we propose a
computationally affordable approach that does not require recrossing
trajectories.

(LBMs) applicable to either static or dynamic mesh refinement algorithms. The
sensor exploits the kinetic nature of LBMs by evaluating the departure of
distribution functions from their local equilibrium state. This sensor is first
compared, in a qualitative manner, to three state-of-the-art sensors: (1) the
vorticity norm, (2) the Q-criterion, and (3) spatial derivatives of the
vorticity. This comparison shows that our kinetic sensor is the most adequate
candidate to propose tailored mesh structures across a wide range of physical
phenomena: incompressible, compressible subsonic/supersonic single phase, and
weakly compressible multiphase flows. As a more quantitative validation, the
sensor is then used to produce the computational mesh for two existing
open-source LB solvers based on inhomogeneous, block-structured meshes with
static and dynamic refinement algorithms, implemented in the Palabos and
AMROC-LBM software, respectively. The sensor is first used to generate a static
mesh to simulate the turbulent 3D lid-driven cavity flow using Palabos.
AMROC-LBM is then adopted to confirm the ability of our sensor to dynamically
adapt the mesh to reach the steady state of the 2D lid-driven cavity flow. Both
configurations show that our sensor successfully produces meshes of high
quality and allows to save computational time.

are introduced in the aperiodic structured surface, the modes exhibit
polarization helicity dependence resulting in the optical spin-Hall effect. The
radiative thermal dispersion bands from a quasicrystal structure were studied
where the observed bands arise from the optical spin-orbit interaction induced
by the aperiodic space-variant orientations of anisotropic antennas. The
optical spin-flip behavior of the revealed modes that arise from the geometric
phase pickup was experimentally observed within the visible spectrum by
measuring the spin-projected diffraction patterns. The introduced ability to
manipulate the light-matter interaction of quasicrystals in a spin-dependent
manner provides the route for molding light via spin-optical aperiodic
artificial planar surfaces.

mathematically as Gaussianity without considering potential diffusion barriers
and compartments. However, this is not true in real scenario: most biological
tissues are comprised of cell membranes, various intracellular and
extracellular spaces, and of other compartments, where the water diffusion is
referred to have a non-Gaussian distribution. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI),
recently considered to be one sensitive biomarker, is an extension of diffusion
tensor imaging, which quantifies the degree of non-Gaussianity of the
diffusion. This work proposes an efficient scheme of maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) in DKI: we start from the Rician noise model of the signal
intensities. By augmenting a Von-Mises distributed latent phase variable, the
Rician likelihood is transformed to a tractable joint density without loss of
generality. A fast computational method, an expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm for MLE is proposed in DKI. To guarantee the physical relevance of
the diffusion kurtosis we apply the ternary quartic (TQ) parametrization to
utilize its positivity, which imposes the upper bound to the kurtosis. A
Fisher-scoring method is used for achieving fast convergence of the individual
diffusion compartments. In addition, we use the barrier method to constrain the
lower bound to the kurtosis. The proposed estimation scheme is conducted on
both synthetic and real data with an objective of healthy human brain. We
compared the method with the other popular ones with promising performance
shown in the results.

changed during their transport and interaction with the background plasma, a
model must ultimately be applied to X-ray observations in order to understand
the mechanism responsible for their acceleration. A cold thick target model is
ubiquitously used for this task, since it provides a simple analytic
relationship between the accelerated electron spectrum and the emitting
electron spectrum in the X-ray source, with the latter quantity readily
obtained from X-ray observations. However, such a model is inappropriate for
the majority of solar flares in which the electrons propagate in a hot

thermalization of fast electrons. The use of a more realistic model, properly
accounting for the properties of the background plasma, and the collisional
diffusion and thermalization of electrons, can alleviate or even remove many of

fields of the Kahler and complex structure moduli in the effective action. We
show that all the RR and NS axion dependence of the flux scalar potential
appears through the said 4-forms. Gauge invariance of these forms then severely
restricts the structure of the axion scalar potentials. Combined with duality
symmetries it suggests that all perturbative corrections to the leading axion

These facts could have an important effect e.g. on the inflaton models based on

rasters taken near the central meridian and the South pole limb. The processed
SJ images and the simultaneously observed fast spectral sequences having large
Doppler shifts, with a pair of red shifted elements together with a faster blue
shifted element from almost the same position, are analyzed. Shifts correspond
to velocities of up to 100 km/s in projection on the plane of the sky. The
occurrence of erupting spicules and macrospicules from these regions is noticed
from images taken before and after the spectra. The cool low first ionization
potential (FIP) element simultaneous line emissions of the MgII h and k
resonance lines do not clearly show a similar signature due to optical
thickness effects but the Si IV broad-band SJ images do. The bidirectional
plasma jets ejected from a small reconnection site are interpreted as the
result of coronal loop-loop interactions leading to reconnection in nearby
sites.

the uncertainties of the two neutron sources operating in low-mass asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars: the 13C(alpha, n)16O reaction, which releases
neutrons radiatively during interpulse periods (kT ~ 8 keV), and the
22Ne(alpha, n)25Mg reaction, partially activated during the convective thermal
pulses (TPs). We focus our attention on the branching points that mainly
influence the abundance of s-only isotopes. In our AGB models, the 13C is fully
consumed radiatively during interpulse. In this case, we find that the present
uncertainty associated to the 13C(alpha, n)16O reaction has marginal effects on
s-only nuclei. On the other hand, a reduction of this rate may increase the
amount of residual (or unburned) 13C at the end of the interpulse: in this
condition, the residual 13C is burned at higher temperature in the convective
zone powered by the following TP. The neutron burst produced by the 22Ne(alpha,
n)25Mg reaction has major effects on the branches along the s path. The
contributions of s-only isotopes with 90 <~ A <= 204 are reproduced within
solar and nuclear uncertainties, even if the 22Ne(alpha, n)25Mg rate is varied
by a factor of two. Improved beta-decay and neutron capture rates of a few key

enables reconstructing motions correctly for synthetic and real scenes, e.g.
from the KITTI benchmark. Our experiments confirm that the derived minimum

higher-order kinematics and is also able to minimize model noise. We also show

individuals who control election result production while guaranteeing privacy

system is the first e-voting system whose voting operation is human verifiable,
i.e., a voter can vote over the web, even when her web client stack is
potentially unsafe, without sacrificing her privacy, and still be assured her
vote was recorded as cast. Additionally, a voter can outsource election
auditing to third parties, still without sacrificing privacy. Finally, as the
number of auditors increases, the probability of election fraud going
undetected is diminished exponentially. We provide a model and security

  Letters",,"10.1088/2041-8205/809/2/L19",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent photometric space missions, such as CoRoT and Kepler revealed that
many RR Lyrae stars pulsate -- beyond their main radial pulsation mode -- in
low amplitude modes. Space data seem to indicate a clear trend, namely overtone
(RRc) stars and modulated fundamental (RRab) RR Lyrae stars ubiquitously show
additional modes, while non-Blazhko RRab stars never do. Two Kepler stars (V350
Lyr and KIC 7021124), however, apparently seemed to break this rule: they were
classified as non-Blazhko RRab stars showing additional modes. We processed
Kepler pixel photometric data of these stars. We detected small amplitude, but
significant Blazhko effect for both stars by using the resulted light curves
and O$-$C diagrams. This finding strengthens the apparent connection between
the Blazhko effect and the excitation of additional modes. In addition, it
yields a potential tool for detecting Blazhko stars through the additional
frequency patterns even if we have only short but accurate time series
observations. V350 Lyr shows the smallest amplitude multiperiodic Blazhko
effect ever detected.

Let $k$ be odd. At
each time step, each vertex $v$ in $G$ polls $k$ random neighbours and takes
the majority colour. If it doesn't have $k$ neighbours, it simply polls all of
them, or all less one if the degree of $v$ is even. We study this protocol on
the preferential attachment model of Albert and Barab\'asi, which gives rise to
a degree distribution that has roughly power-law $P(x) \sim \frac{1}{x^{3}}$,
as well as generalisations which give exponents larger than $3$. The setting is
as follows: Initially each vertex of $G$ is red independently with probability
$\alpha < \frac{1}{2}$, and is otherwise blue. We show that if $\alpha$ is
sufficiently biased away from $\frac{1}{2}$, then with high probability,
consensus is reached on the initial global majority within $O(\log_d \log_d t)$
steps. Here $t$ is the number of vertices and $d \geq 5$ is the minimum of $k$

previous SFA studies is broken. Two types of interference are observed and
thoroughly analyzed, namely that caused by electron indistinguishability and

find that interference is most prominent around the diagonal and anti-diagonal
in the parallel-momentum plane and provide fully analytical expressions for
most interference patterns encountered. We also show that this interference can
be controlled by an appropriate choice of phase and excited-state geometry.

radio pulses in pulsar timing experiments that target mostly millisecond
pulsars (MSPs) due to their high rotational stability. This allows for detailed
study of MSPs and forms the basis of experiments to detect gravitational waves.
Apart from intrinsic and propagation effects, such as pulse-to-pulse jitter and
dispersion variations in the interstellar medium, timing precision is limited
in part by the following: polarization purity of the telescope's orthogonally
polarized receptors, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the pulsar profile, and
the polarization fidelity of the system. Using simulations, we present how
fundamental limitations in recovering the true polarization reduce the
precision of ToA measurements. Any real system will respond differently to each
source observed depending on the unique pulsar polarization profile. Using the
profiles of known MSPs we quantify the limits of observing system
specifications that yield satisfactory ToA measurements, and we place a
practical design limit beyond which improvement of the system results in
diminishing returns. Our aim is to justify limits for the front-end
polarization characteristics of next generation radio telescopes, leading to
the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).

social stratification of ESN users into different social classes, (2)
supervision link inference from managers to subordinates, and (3) consecutive

be significantly reduced via a real-time adaptive decision rule. An adaptive
decision rule stops the readout as soon as a desired level of confidence has
been achieved, as opposed to setting a fixed readout time $t_f$. The
performance of the adaptive decision is characterized by the ""adaptive-decision
speedup,"" $t_f/T$. In this work, we reformulate this readout problem in terms
of the first-passage time of a particle undergoing stochastic motion. This
formalism allows us to theoretically establish the maximum achievable
adaptive-decision speedups for several physical two-state readout
implementations. We show that for two common readout schemes (the Gaussian
latching readout and a readout relying on state-dependent decay), the speedup
is bounded by $4$ and $2$, respectively, in the limit of high single-shot
readout fidelity. We experimentally study the achievable speedup in a
real-world scenario by applying the adaptive decision rule to a readout of the
nitrogen-vacancy-center (NV-center) charge state. We find a speedup of $\approx
2$ with our experimental parameters. In addition, we propose a simple readout
scheme for which the speedup can, in principle, be increased without bound as
the fidelity is increased. Our results should lead to immediate improvements in
nanoscale magnetometry based on spin-to-charge conversion of the NV-center
spin, and provide a theoretical framework for further optimization of the

prohibition under convex cone portfolio constraints. This is a long-standing
and difficult problem not only because of its theoretical significance, but
also for its practical importance. First of all, we transform the above problem
into an equivalent mean-variance problem with bankruptcy prohibition without
portfolio constraints. The latter is then treated using martingale theory. Our

cavity is driven by a laser at a red or blue mechanical subband, and a probe
laser measures the reflection close to the cavity resonance. Under these

reflection (OMIR) or absorption (OMIA) and investigate the optomechanical
response in the limit of non-linear driving of the mechanics. Similar to linear
mechanical drive, an overcoupled cavity the red-sideband drive may lead to both
OMIA and OMIR depending on the strength of the drive, whereas the blue-sideband
drive only leads to OMIR. The dynamics of the phase of the mechanical resonator
leads to the difference between the shapes of the response of the cavity and
the amplitude response of the driven Duffing oscillator, for example, at weak
red-sideband drive the OMIA dip has no inflection point. We also verify that
mechanical non-linearities beyond Duffing model have little effect on the size

$X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be, possibly dependent, $[0,1]$-valued random variables. What
is a sharp upper bound on the probability that their sum is significantly
larger than their mean? In the case of independent random variables, a
fundamental tool for bounding such probabilities is devised by Wassily
Hoeffding. In this paper we consider analogues of Hoeffding's result for sums
of dependent random variables for which we have certain information on their
dependency structure. We prove a result that yields concentration inequalities
for several notions of weak dependence between random variables. Additionally,
we obtain a new concentration inequality for sums of, possibly dependent,
$[0,1]$-valued random variables, $X_1,\ldots,X_n$, that satisfy the following
condition: there exist constants $\gamma \in (0,1)$ and $\delta\in (0,1]$ such
that for every subset $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ we have
$\mathbb{E}\left[\prod_{i\in A} X_i \prod_{i\notin A}(1-X_i) \right]\leq
\gamma^{|A|} \delta^{n-|A|}$, where $|A|$ denotes the cardinality of $A$. Our
approach applies to several sums of weakly dependent random variables such as
sums of martingale difference sequences, sums of $k$-wise independent random
variables and $U$-statistics. Finally, we discuss some applications to the
theory of random graphs.

by resonances, but does not depend on the initial phases of the disc. For a
Mestel disc with ${Q \sim 1.5}$, the polarization cloud around each star boosts
up its secular effect by a factor of the order of a thousand or more, promoting
accordingly the dynamical relevance of self-induced collisional secular
evolution. The position and shape of the induced resonant ridge are found to be
in very good agreement with the prediction of the Balescu-Lenard equation,
which scales with the square of the susceptibility of the disc.

secular diffusion of giant molecular clouds in galactic discs, the secular

broader wavelength ranges lead to a need for robust polarimeters, efficient on
a wide spectral domain, and adapted to space conditions. As part of the UVMag
consortium, created to develop spectropolarimetric UV facilities in space, such
as the Arago mission project, we present an innovative concept of static
spectropolarimetry. We studied a static and polychromatic method for
spectropolarimetry, applicable to stellar physics. Instead of modulating the
polarization information temporally, as usually done in spectropolarimeters,
the modulation is performed in a spatial direction, orthogonal to the spectral
one. Thanks to the proportionality between phase retardance imposed by a
birefringent material and its thickness, birefringent wedges can be used to
create this spatial modulation. The light is then spectrally cross-dispersed,
and a full-Stokes determination of the polarization over the whole spectrum can
be obtained with a single-shot measurement. The use of Magnesium Fluoride
wedges, for example, could lead to a compact, static polarimeter working at
wavelengths from 0.115 mm up to 7 mm. We present the theory and simulations of
this concept, as well as laboratory validation and a practical application to
Arago.

such as remote sensing and robot vision, these systems use single-photon
detectors that resolve individual photon arrivals. Even so, they must detect a
large number of photons to mitigate Poisson shot noise and reject anomalous
photon detections from background light. We introduce a novel framework for
accurate depth imaging using a small number of detected photons in the presence
of an unknown amount of background light that may vary spatially. It employs a
Poisson observation model for the photon detections plus a union-of-subspaces
constraint on the discrete-time flux from the scene at any single pixel.
Together, they enable a greedy signal-pursuit algorithm to rapidly and
simultaneously converge on accurate estimates of scene depth and background
flux, without any assumptions on spatial correlations of the depth or
background flux. Using experimental single-photon data, we demonstrate that our
proposed framework recovers depth features with 1.7 cm absolute error, using 15
photons per image pixel and an illumination pulse with 6.7-cm scaled
root-mean-square length. We also show that our framework outperforms the
conventional pixelwise log-matched filtering, which is a
computationally-efficient approximation to the maximum-likelihood solution, by
a factor of 6.1 in absolute depth error.

fascinated biologists. While not universal, scaling relationships with
exponents that are close to multiples of 1/4 are common and have been described
in all major clades. Foremost among these relationships is the 3/4 scaling of
metabolism with mass which underpins the 1/4 power dependence of biological
rates and times. Several models have been advanced to explain the underlying
mechanistic drivers of such patterns, but questions regarding a disconnect
between model structures and empirical data have limited their widespread
acceptance. Notable among these is a fractal branching model which predicts
power law scaling of both metabolism and physical dimensions. While a power law
is a useful first approximation to many datasets, non-linearity in some large
data compilations suggest the possibility of more complex or alternative
mechanisms. Here, we first show that quarter power scaling can be derived using
only the preservation of volume flow rate and velocity as model constraints.
Applying our model to the specific case of land plants, we show that
incorporating biomechanical principles and allowing different parts of plant
branching networks to be optimized to serve different functions predicts
non-linearity in allometric relationships, and helps explain why interspecific
scaling exponents covary along a fractal continuum. We also demonstrate that
while branching may be a stochastic process, due to the conservation of volume,
data may still be consistent with the expectations for a fractal network when
one examines subtrees within a tree. Data from numerous sources at the level of
plant shoots, stems, petioles, and leaves show strong agreement with our model
predictions. This novel theoretical framework provides an easily testable
alternative to current general models of plant metabolic allometry.

black hole (or another body with a Schwarzschild metric) embedded in plasma
with a spherically symmetric density distribution is derived. The deflection
angle in this case is determined by the mutual combination of different
factors: gravity, dispersion, and refraction. While the effects of deflection
by the gravity in vacuum and the refractive deflection in a nonhomogeneous
medium are well known, the new effect is that, in the case of a homogeneous
plasma, in the absence of refractive deflection, the gravitational deflection
differs from the vacuum deflection and depends on the photon frequency. In the
presence of a plasma nonhomogeneity, the chromatic refractive deflection also
occurs, so the presence of plasma always makes gravitational lensing chromatic.
In particular, the presence of plasma leads to different angular positions of
the same image if it is observed at different wavelengths. It is discussed in
detail how to apply the presented formulas for the calculation of the
deflection angle in different situations. Gravitational lensing in plasma
beyond the weak deflection approximation is also considered.

stability of non-spherical bodies. We solve the equations that describe, in a
simplified way, the Newtonian dynamics of a self-gravitating non-rotating
spheroidal body. We find that, after loss of stability, a contraction to a
singularity occurs only in a pure spherical collapse, and deviations from
spherical symmetry prevent the contraction to the singularity through a
stabilizing action of nonlinear non-spherical oscillations. The development of
instability leads to the formation of a regularly or chaotically oscillating
body, in which dynamical motion prevents the formation of the singularity. We
find regions of chaotic and regular pulsations by constructing a Poincare
diagram. A real collapse occurs after damping of the oscillations because of
energy losses, shock wave formation or viscosity. We use our approach to
investigate approximately the first stages of collapse during the large scale
structure formation. The theory of this process started from ideas of Ya. B.
Zeldovich, concerning the formation of strongly non-spherical structures during
nonlinear stages of the development of gravitational instability, known as
'Zeldovich's pancakes'. In this paper the collapse of non-collisional dark
matter and the formation of pancake structures are investigated approximately.
We estimate an emission of very long gravitational waves during the collapse,

area formation with reference to The New Economic Geography (NEG) theories and
more precisely to the paper of Paul Krugman (1991), ""Increasing returns and
economic geography"" which explains the mechanisms of economic activities
concentration through two types of forces: centripetal forces enhancing the
economic activities concentration and centrifugal forces hindering the
agglomeration process. In fact, these mechanisms are translated into a system
of nonlinear equations which is very hard to solve analytically. As a
consequence, the use of numerical methods is highly advocated. We present some
numerical simulations using real Algerian data.

  deformable matrix","11 Figures, 20 pages (NOTE: Figures are delegated to the back of the
  manuscript)",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The effect of the initial uniaxial stress and a surrounding elastic matrix on
the transverse vibration response of a single-layered graphene sheet (SLGS) is
investigated through a theoretical formulation that is based on the nonlocal
Kirchhoff plate theory. The surrounding elastic matrix of the SLGS is modeled
as a foundation of the Pasternak-type. The elliptic partial differential
equation governing the dynamics of the pre-stressed SLGS is solved with the
Rayleigh method. Numerical results from the analyses reveal different level of
sensitivity of the vibration response of the SLGS to changes in the control
parameters of the model. Pareto charts of the effect of the control parameters
in the mathematical model show the shear modulus of the foundation to have the
most dominant influence on the fundamental natural frequency of the SLGS. The
small-scale effect is found to have more pronounced effect on the vibration
response of the SLGS when it is fully clamped at the four edges.
