too heavily dependent on each other to be treated as a bag of words, and to
adapt the indexing and ranking accordingly. Dependent terms are predominantly
identified using lexical frequency statistics, assuming that (a) if terms
co-occur often enough in some corpus, they are semantically dependent; (b) the
more often they co-occur, the more semantically dependent they are. This
assumption is not always correct: the frequency of co-occurring terms can be
separate from the strength of their semantic dependence. E.g. ""red tape"" might
be overall less frequent than ""tape measure"" in some corpus, but this does not
mean that ""red""+""tape"" are less dependent than ""tape""+""measure"". This is
especially the case for non-compositional phrases, i.e. phrases whose meaning
cannot be composed from the individual meanings of their terms (such as the
phrase ""red tape"" meaning bureaucracy). Motivated by this lack of distinction
between the frequency and strength of term dependence in IR, we present a
principled approach for handling term dependence in queries, using both lexical
frequency and semantic evidence. We focus on non-compositional phrases,
extending a recent unsupervised model for their detection [21] to IR. Our
approach, integrated into ranking using Markov Random Fields [31], yields
effectiveness gains over competitive TREC baselines, showing that there is
still room for improvement in the very well-studied area of term dependence in
IR.

integrable dispersionless multidimensional PDEs is non-local, and the proper
choice of integration constants should be the one dictated by the associated
Inverse Scattering Transform (IST). Using the recently made rigorous IST for
vector fields associated with the so-called Pavlov equation
$v_{xt}+v_{yy}+v_xv_{xy}-v_yv_{xx}=0$, in this paper we establish the
following. 1. The non-local term $\partial_x^{-1}$ arising from its
evolutionary form $v_{t}=
v_{x}v_{y}-\partial^{-1}_{x}\,\partial_{y}\,[v_{y}+v^2_{x}]$ corresponds to the
asymmetric integral $-\int_x^{\infty}dx'$. 2. Smooth and well-localized initial
data $v(x,y,0)$ evolve in time developing, for $t>0$, the constraint
$\partial_y {\cal M}(y,t)\equiv 0$, where ${\cal
M}(y,t)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \left[v_{y}(x,y,t)
+(v_{x}(x,y,t))^2\right]\,dx$. 3. Since no smooth and well-localized initial
data can satisfy such constraint at $t=0$, the initial ($t=0+$) dynamics of the
Pavlov equation can not be smooth, although, as it was already established,
small norm solutions remain regular for all positive times. We expect that the
techniques developed in this paper to prove the above results, should be
successfully used in the study of the non-locality of other basic examples of
integrable dispersionless PDEs in multidimensions.

of (1+1) dimensional equations. With this ansatz, the KP and 2DBO equations can
be exactly reduced to cylindrical Korteweg-de Vries (cKdV) and cylindrical
Benjamin-Ono (cBO) equations, respectively. Whitham modulation equations which
describe DSW evolution in the cKdV and cBO equations are derived in general and
Riemann type variables are introduced. DSWs obtained from the numerical

In turn, DSWs obtained from direct numerical simulations of the KP and 2DBO

  Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/809/1/94",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a model in which planetesimal disks are built from the combination
of planetesimal formation and accretion of radially drifting pebbles onto
existing planetesimals. In this model, the rate of accretion of pebbles onto
planetesimals quickly outpaces the rate of direct planetesimal formation in the
inner disk. This allows for the formation of a high mass inner disk without the
need for enhanced planetesimal formation or a massive protoplanetary disk. Our
proposed mechanism for planetesimal disk growth does not require any special
conditions to operate. Consequently, we expect that high mass planetesimal
disks form naturally in nearly all systems. The extent of this growth is
controlled by the total mass in pebbles that drifts through the inner disk.
Anything that reduces the rate or duration of pebble delivery will
correspondingly reduce the final mass of the planetesimal disk. Therefore, we
expect that low mass stars (with less massive protoplanetary disks), low
metallicity stars and stars with giant planets should all grow less massive
planetesimal disks. The evolution of planetesimal disks into planetary systems
remains a mystery. However, we argue that late stage planet formation models
should begin with a massive disk. This reinforces the idea that massive and

  Experience Report",,,,,"cs.SE cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Migration to the cloud has been a popular topic in industry and academia in
recent years. Despite many benefits that the cloud presents, such as high
availability and scalability, most of the on-premise application architectures
are not ready to fully exploit the benefits of this environment, and adapting
them to this environment is a non-trivial task. Microservices have appeared
recently as novel architectural styles that are native to the cloud. These
cloud-native architectures can facilitate migrating on-premise architectures to
fully benefit from the cloud environments because non-functional attributes,
like scalability, are inherent in this style. The existing approaches on cloud
migration does not mostly consider cloud-native architectures as their
first-class citizens. As a result, the final product may not meet its primary
drivers for migration. In this paper, we intend to report our experience and
lessons learned in an ongoing project on migrating a monolithic on-premise
software architecture to microservices. We concluded that microservices is not
a one-fit-all solution as it introduces new complexities to the system, and
many factors, such as distribution complexities, should be considered before
adopting this style. However, if adopted in a context that needs high
flexibility in terms of scalability and availability, it can deliver its
promised benefits.

the preferences of all voters belong to this set, the majority relation has no

to be closed in the sense that it contains the majority relation of every
profile with an odd number of individuals whose preferences belong to this
domain.
  We show that every closed Condorcet domain is naturally endowed with the
structure of a median graph and that, conversely, every median graph is
associated with a closed Condorcet domain (which may not be a unique one). The
subclass of those Condorcet domains that correspond to linear graphs (chains)
are exactly the preference domains with the classical single crossing property.
As a corollary, we obtain that the domains with the so-called `representative
voter property' (with the exception of a 4-cycle) are the single crossing
domains.
  Maximality of a Condorcet domain imposes additional restrictions on the
underlying median graph. We prove that among all trees only the chains can
induce maximal Condorcet domains, and we characterize the single crossing
domains that in fact do correspond to maximal Condorcet domains.
  Finally, using Nehring's and Puppe's (2007) characterization of monotone
Arrowian aggregation, our analysis yields a rich class of strategy-proof social

views text as a Markov process generating sequences of discourse entities
(entity n-grams); we use the entropy of these entity n-grams to approximate the
rate at which new information appears in text, reasoning that as more new words
appear, the topic increasingly drifts and text coherence decreases. Our second
model extends the work of Guinaudeau & Strube [28] that represents text as a
graph of discourse entities, linked by different relations, such as their
distance or adjacency in text. We use several graph topology metrics to
approximate different aspects of the discourse flow that can indicate
coherence, such as the average clustering or betweenness of discourse entities
in text. Experiments with several instantiations of these models show that: (i)
our models perform on a par with two other well-known models of text coherence
even without any parameter tuning, and (ii) reranking retrieval results
according to their coherence scores gives notable performance gains, confirming
a relation between document coherence and relevance. This work contributes two
novel models of document coherence, the application of which to IR complements
recent work in the integration of document cohesiveness or comprehensibility to

The separation of the positive and negative vorticity is due to the attraction
produced by a large scale vortex on the small scale vortices of the same sign.
More precisely, a large scale velocity is shown to determine average transverse
drifts, which have opposite orientations for positive and negative vorticity.
They appear in the presence of trapping and lead to energy flow to large scales
due to the increase of the circulation of the large vortex. Recent results on
drift turbulence evolution in magnetically confined plasmas are discussed in
order to underline the idea that there is a link between the inverse cascade
and trajectory trapping. The physical mechanisms are different in fluids and
plasmas due to the different types of nonlinearities of the two systems, but
trajectory trapping has the main role in both cases.

We will show that actually $\textit{interpair}$ nondynamic correlation is the
key to a cusp-free qualitatively correct description of H$_4$ PES. By
introducing $\textit{interpair}$ nondynamic correlation, PNOF6 is shown to
avoid cusps and provide the correct smooth PES features at distances close to
equilibrium, total and local spin properties along with the correct electron
delocalization, as reflected by natural orbitals and multicenter delocalization
indices.

  fitness landscapes compatible with Fisher's Geometric model?","Added an alternative ABC algorithm based on a set of summary
  statistics",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fitness landscape defines the relationship between genotypes and fitness
in a given environment, and underlies fundamental quantities such as the
distribution of selection coefficient, or the magnitude and type of epistasis.
A better understanding of variation of landscape structure across species and
environments is thus necessary to understand and predict how populations will
adapt. An increasing number of experiments investigates the properties of
fitness landscapes by identifying mutations, constructing genotypes with
combinations of these mutations, and measuring the fitness of these genotypes.
Yet these empirical landscapes represent a very small sample of the vast space
of all possible genotypes, and this sample is often biased by the protocol used
to identify mutations. Here we develop a rigorous statistical framework based
on Approximate Bayesian Computation to address these concerns, and use this
flexible framework to fit a broad class of phenotypic fitness models (including
Fisher's model) to 26 empirical landscapes representing 9 diverse biological
systems. In spite of uncertainty due to the small size of most published
empirical landscapes, the inferred landscapes have similar structure in similar
biological systems. Surprisingly, goodness of fit tests reveal that this class
of phenotypic models, which has been successful so far in interpreting
experimental data, is a plausible model in only 3 out of 9 biological systems.
More precisely, although Fisher's model was able to explain several statistical
properties of the landscapes - including mean and standard deviation of
selection and epistasis coefficients -, it was often unable to explain the full
structure of fitness landscapes.

of polymatrix common-payoff games). In those games, players are vertices of an
undirected, simple graph, and the strategy space of each player is the set of
colors from $1$ to $k$. A tight bound on the price of anarchy of
$\frac{k}{k-1}$ is known (Hoefer 2007, Kun et al. 2013), for the case that each
player's payoff is the number of her neighbors with different color than
herself. The study of more complex payoff functions was left as an open
problem.
  We compute payoff for a player by determining the distance of her color to
the color of each of her neighbors, applying a non-negative, real-valued,
concave function $f$ to each of those distances, and then summing up the
resulting values. This includes the payoff functions suggested by Kun et al.
(2013) for future work as special cases.
  Denote $f^*$ the maximum value that $f$ attains on the possible distances
$0,\dots,k-1$. We prove an upper bound of $2$ on the price of anarchy for
concave functions $f$ that are non-decreasing or which assume $f^*$ at a
distance on or below $\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor$. Matching lower bounds are
given for the monotone case and for the case that $f^*$ is assumed in
$\frac{k}{2}$ for even $k$. For general concave functions, we prove an upper
bound of $3$. We use a simple but powerful technique: we obtain an upper bound
of $\lambda \geq 1$ on the price of anarchy if we manage to give a splitting
$\lambda_1 + \dots + \lambda_k = \lambda$ such that $\sum_{s=1}^k \lambda_s
\cdot f(|s-p|) \geq f^*$ for all $p \in \{1,\dots,k\}$. The discovery of
working splittings can be supported by computer experiments. We show how, once
we have an idea what kind of splittings work, this technique helps in giving
simple proofs, which mainly work by case distinctions, algebraic manipulations,

$3/2^-$ and $5/2^+$ from $\Lambda_b$ decays. These new states can be

features of these pentaquarks can be described by diquark model. The diquark
model predicts that the $3/2^-$ and $5/2^+$ are in two separate octet
multiplets of flavor $SU(3)$ and there is also an additional decuplet
pentaquark multiplet. Finding the states in these multiplets can provide
crucial evidence for this model. The weak decays of b-baryon to a light meson
and a pentaquark can have Cabibbo allowed and suppressed decay channels. We
find that in the $SU(3)$ limit, for $U$-spin related decay modes the ratio of
the decay rates of Cabibbo suppressed to Cabibbo allowed decay channels is
given by $|V_{cd}|^2/|V_{cs}|^2$. There are also other testable relations for
b-baryon weak decays into a pentaquark and a light pseudoscalar. These
relations can be used as tests for the diquark model for pentaquark.

phase retrieval in which the goal is to reconstruct a sparse vector from the

on constrained sensing vectors and a two-stage reconstruction method that
consists of two standard convex programs that are solved sequentially.
  In recent years, various methods are proposed for compressive phase
retrieval, but they have suboptimal sample complexity or lack robustness
guarantees. The main obstacle has been that there is no straightforward convex
relaxations for the type of structure in the target. Given a set of
underdetermined measurements, there is a standard framework for recovering a
sparse matrix, and a standard framework for recovering a low-rank matrix.
However, a general, efficient method for recovering a jointly sparse and
low-rank matrix has remained elusive.
  Deviating from the models with generic measurements, in this paper we show
that if the sensing vectors are chosen at random from an incoherent subspace,
then the low-rank and sparse structures of the target signal can be effectively
decoupled. We show that a recovery algorithm that consists of a low-rank
recovery stage followed by a sparse recovery stage will produce an accurate
estimate of the target when the number of measurements is
$\mathsf{O}(k\,\log\frac{d}{k})$, where $k$ and $d$ denote the sparsity level
and the dimension of the input signal. We also evaluate the algorithm through
numerical simulation.

maintain the benefits of Newton's method, such as a fast rate of convergence,

Newton methods for policy optimization in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We
first analyse the structure of the Hessian of the objective function for MDPs.
We show that, like the gradient, the Hessian exhibits useful structure in the

methods involve approximating the Hessian by ignoring certain terms in the
Hessian which are difficult to estimate. The approximate Hessians possess
desirable properties, such as negative definiteness, and we demonstrate several
important performance guarantees including guaranteed ascent directions,
invariance to affine transformation of the parameter space, and convergence
guarantees. We finally provide a unifying perspective of key policy search

important properties and differences among the outlined situations.
Applicability is showcased with three real-world unsupervised classification

natural extension of this methodology to any type of generative model by
deriving an equivalent context-aware algorithm for variational autoencoders

Based on this finding, we explore a model in which the superconductivity in STO
is enabled by its proximity to the ferroelectric quantum critical point and the
soft mode fluctuations provide the pairing interaction on introduction of
carriers. Within our model, the low doping limit of the superconducting dome is
explained by the emergence of the Fermi surface, and the high doping limit by
departure from the quantum critical regime. We predict that the highest

SDSS-II Type Ia SNe, and an application of the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test using
model-independent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data, have suggested that the
principal constraint underlying the cosmic expansion is the total
equation-of-state of the cosmic fluid, rather than that of its dark energy.
These studies have focused on the critical redshift range (0 < z < 2) within
which the transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion is thought to
have occurred, and they suggest that the cosmic fluid has zero active mass,
consistent with a constant expansion rate. The evident impact of this
conclusion on cosmological theory calls for an independent confirmation. In
this paper, we carry out this crucial one-on-one comparison between the R_h=ct
Universe (an FRW cosmology with zero active mass) and wCDM/LCDM, using the
latest high-z measurements of H(z). Whereas the Type Ia SNe yield the
integrated luminosity distance, while the AP diagnostic tests the geometry of
the Universe, the Hubble parameter directly samples the expansion rate itself.
We find that the model-independent cosmic chronometer data prefer R_h}=ct over
wCDM/LCDM with a BIC likelihood of ~95% versus only ~5%, in strong support of
the earlier SNeIa and AP results. This contrasts with a recent analysis of H(z)
data based solely on BAO measurements which, however, strongly depend on the
assumed cosmology. We discuss why the latter approach is inappropriate for
model comparisons, and emphasize again the need for truly model-independent
observations to be used in cosmological tests.

projects to assess the significance of recycled stellar ejecta as fuel for star
formation. The fractional contributions of stellar mass loss to the cosmic star
formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass densities increase with time, reaching
$35 \%$ and $19 \%$, respectively, at $z=0$. The importance of recycling
increases steeply with galaxy stellar mass for $M_{\ast} < 10^{10.5}$
M$_{\odot}$, and decreases mildly at higher mass. This trend arises from the
mass dependence of feedback associated with star formation and AGN, which
preferentially suppresses star formation fuelled by recycling. Recycling is
more important for satellites than centrals and its contribution decreases with
galactocentric radius. The relative contribution of AGB stars increases with
time and towards galaxy centers. This is a consequence of the more gradual
release of AGB ejecta compared to that of massive stars, and the preferential
removal of the latter by star formation-driven outflows and by lock up in
stellar remnants. Recycling-fuelled star formation exhibits a tight, positive
correlation with galaxy metallicity, with a secondary dependence on the
relative abundance of alpha elements (which are predominantly synthesized in
massive stars), that is insensitive to the subgrid models for feedback. Hence,
our conclusions are directly relevant for the origin of the mass-metallicity
relation and metallicity gradients. Applying the relation between recycling and
metallicity to the observed mass-metallicity relation yields our best estimate
of the mass-dependent contribution of recycling. For centrals with a mass
similar to that of the Milky Way, we infer the contributions of recycled
stellar ejecta to the SFR and stellar mass to be $35 \%$ and $20 \%$,
respectively.

in regulating the growth of host galaxies. Cosmological and galaxy formation
simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), which usually use a
fixed mass for SPH particles, often employ the same sub-grid Active galactic
nuclei (AGN) feedback prescription across a range of resolutions. It is thus
important to ask how the impact of the simulated AGN feedback on a galaxy
changes when only the numerical resolution (the SPH particle mass) changes. We
present a suite of simulations modelling the interaction of an AGN outflow with
the ambient turbulent and clumpy interstellar medium (ISM) in the inner part of
the host galaxy at a range of mass resolutions. We find that, with other things
being equal, degrading the resolution leads to feedback becoming more efficient
at clearing out all gas in its path. For the simulations presented here, the
difference in the mass of the gas ejected by AGN feedback varies by more than a
factor of ten between our highest and lowest resolution simulations. This
happens because feedback-resistant high density clumps are washed out at low
effective resolutions. We also find that changes in numerical resolution lead
to undesirable artifacts in how the AGN feedback affects the AGN immediate

a single training example per class. We show that feedforward neural networks
outperform state-of-the-art methods for recognizing objects from novel

improve our performance on this task, we propose to take advantage of a
supplementary dataset in which we observe a separate set of objects from
multiple viewpoints. We introduce a new approach for training deep learning
methods for instance recognition with limited training data, in which we use an
auxiliary multi-view dataset to train our network to be robust to viewpoint
changes. We find that this approach leads to a more robust classifier for
recognizing objects from novel viewpoints, outperforming previous

produce a transient luminous event. Such tidal disruption events (TDEs) may
play an important role in the detection and characterization of MBHs and probe
the properties and dynamics of their nuclear stellar clusters (NSCs) hosts.
Previous studies estimated the recent rates of TDEs in the local universe.
However, the long-term evolution of the rates throughout the history of the
universe has been hardly explored. Here we consider the TDE history, using
evolutionary models for the evolution of galactic nuclei. We use a 1D
Fokker-Planck approach to explore the evolution of MBH-hosting NSCs, and obtain
the disruption rates of stars during their evolution. We complement these with
an analysis of TDEs history based on N-body simulation data, and find them to
be comparable. We consider NSCs that are built-up from close-in star-formation
(SF) or from SF/clusters-dispersal far-out, a few pc from the MBH. We also
explore cases where primordial NSCs exist and later evolve through additional
star-formation/cluster-dispersal processes. We study the dependence of the TDE
history on the type of galaxy, as well as the dependence on the MBH mass. These
provide several scenarios, with a continuous increase of the TDE rates over
time for cases of far-out SF and a more complex behavior for the close-in SF
cases. Finally, we integrate the TDE histories of the various scenarios to
provide a total TDE history of the universe, which can be potentially probed
with future large surveys (e.g. LSST).

scaling relation between velocity dispersion and SZ mass estimates from the
integrated Compton parameter for an SZ complete sample of 83 clusters. The
observed relation agrees very well with a simple virial scaling from mass
(based on SZ) to velocity dispersion. The SZ mass estimates (calibrated with
hydrostatic X-ray mass estimates) are not significantly biased. Further, the
velocity dispersion of cluster galaxies is consistent with the expected
velocity dispersion of dark matter particles, indicating that galaxies are good
dynamical tracers (i.e., velocity bias is small). Significant mass bias in SZ
mass estimates could relieve tension between cosmological results from Planck
SZ cluster counts and Planck CMB data. However, the excellent agreement between
our measured velocity dispersions and those predicted from a virial scaling
relation suggests that any SZ mass bias is too small to reconcile SZ and CMB
results. In principle, SZ mass bias and velocity bias of galaxies could
conspire to yield good agreement, but the required velocity bias is
$\sigma_{galaxy}\approx 0.77\sigma_{DM}$, outside the range of plausible models

the physics of certain three dimensional quantum spin liquid states. The
resulting insights provide an interesting answer to the old question of how
particle-hole symmetry is realized in composite fermion liquids. Specifically
the metallic state at filling $\nu = \frac{1}{2}$ - described originally in
pioneering work by Halperin , Lee, and Read as a liquid of composite fermions -
was proposed recently by Son to be described by a particle-hole symmetric
effective field theory distinct from that in the prior literature. We show how
the relation to topological insulator surface states leads to a physical
understanding of the correctness of this proposal. We develop a simple picture
of the particle-hole symmetric composite fermion through a modification of
older pictures as electrically neutral ""dipolar"" particles. We revisit the
phenomenology of composite fermi liquids (with or without particle-hole
symmetry), and show that their heat/electrical transport dramatically violates
the conventional Wiedemann-Franz law but satisfies a modified one. We also
discuss the implications of these insights for finding physical realizations of

band with the Apodizing Phase Plate on NaCo/VLT and was recovered by L'-band
non-coronagraphic imaging data taken a few days later. We confirm the companion
is co-moving with the star with SINFONI integral field spectrograph H+K data.
We present the first published data obtained with SINFONI in pupil-tracking
mode. HD 984 has been argued to be a kinematic member of the 30 Myr-old Columba
group, and its HR diagram position is not altogether inconsistent with being a
ZAMS star of this age. By consolidating different age indicators, including
isochronal age, coronal X-ray emission, and stellar rotation, we independently
estimate a main sequence age of 115$\pm$85 Myr (95% CL) which does not rely on
this kinematic association. The mass of directly imaged companions are usually
inferred from theoretical evolutionary tracks, which are highly dependent on
the age of the star. Based on the age extrema, we demonstrate that with our
photometric data alone, the companion's mass is highly uncertain: between 33
and 96 M$_{\rm Jup}$ (0.03-0.09 M$_{\odot}$) using the COND evolutionary
models. We compare the companion's SINFONI spectrum with field dwarf spectra to
break this degeneracy. Based on the slope and shape of the spectrum in the
H-band, we conclude that the companion is an M$6.0\pm0.5$ dwarf. The age of the
system is not further constrained by the companion, as M dwarfs are poorly fit
on low-mass evolutionary tracks. This discovery emphasizes the importance of
obtaining a spectrum to spectral type companions around F-stars.

general supersymmetric scenario. In these models, the flavour changing decays
arise at loop-level but, originating from a dimension-four operator, do not
decouple and may provide a first sign of new physics for heavy masses beyond
collider reach. In the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the
Standard Model (MSSM), we find that the largest branching ratio of the lightest
Higgs ($H_1$) is ${\cal O}(10^{-6})$ after imposing present experimental
constraints. While heavy Higgs states may still present branching ratios ${\cal
O}(10^{-3})$. In a more general supersymmetric scenario, where additional Higgs
states may modify the Higgs mixings, the branching ratio BR($H_1 \to b s$) can
reach values ${\cal O}(10^{-4})$ , while heavy Higgses still remain at ${\cal
O}(10^{-3})$. Although these values are clearly out of reach for the LHC, a
full study in a linear collider environment could be worth pursuing.

simplicial complexes and (non-singular) characteristic maps. The authors in
their previous paper provided a new way to find all characteristic maps on a
simplicial complex $K(J)$ obtainable by a sequence of wedgings from $K$. The
main idea was that characteristic maps on $K$ theoretically determine all
possible characteristic maps on a wedge of $K$.
  In this work, we further develop our previous work for classification of
toric spaces. For a star-shaped simplicial sphere $K$ of dimension $n-1$ with
$m$ vertices, the Picard number $\operatorname{Pic}(K)$ of $K$ is $m-n$. We
refer to $K$ a seed if $K$ cannot be obtained by wedgings. First, we show that,
for a fixed positive integer $\ell$, there are at most finitely many seeds of
Picard number $\ell$ supporting characteristic maps. As a corollary, the
conjecture proposed by V. V. Batyrev in 1991 is solved affirmatively.
  Second, we investigate a systematic way to find all characteristic maps on
$K(J)$ using combinatorial objects called (realizable) puzzles that only depend
on a seed $K$. These two facts lead to a practical way to classify the toric
spaces of fixed Picard number.

data assimilation methods used to combine high dimensional, nonlinear dynamical
models with observed data. Despite their widespread usage in climate science
and oil reservoir simulation, very little is known about the long-time behavior
of these methods and why they are effective when applied with modest ensemble
sizes in large dimensional turbulent dynamical systems. By following the basic
principles of energy dissipation and controllability of filters, this paper
establishes a simple, systematic and rigorous framework for the nonlinear
analysis of EnKF and ESRF with arbitrary ensemble size, focusing on the
dynamical properties of boundedness and geometric ergodicity. The time uniform
boundedness guarantees that the filter estimate will not diverge to machine
infinity in finite time, which is a potential threat for EnKF and ESQF known as
the catastrophic filter divergence. Geometric ergodicity ensures in addition
that the filter has a unique invariant measure and that initialization errors
will dissipate exponentially in time. We establish these results by introducing
a natural notion of observable energy dissipation. The time uniform bound is
achieved through a simple Lyapunov function argument, this result applies to
systems with complete observations and strong kinetic energy dissipation, but
also to concrete examples with incomplete observations. With the Lyapunov
function argument established, the geometric ergodicity is obtained by
verifying the controllability of the filter processes; in particular, such
analysis for ESQF relies on a careful multivariate perturbation analysis of the
covariance eigen-structure.

classification algorithm. Due to its large storage and computational
requirements, it is suitable for cloud outsourcing. However, k-NN is often run
on sensitive data such as medical records, user images, or personal

k-NN system.
  Prior works have all assumed the data owners (who submit data to the
outsourced k-NN system) are a single trusted party. However, we observe that in
many practical scenarios, there may be multiple mutually distrusting data
owners. In this work, we present the first framing and exploration of privacy
preservation in an outsourced k-NN system with multiple data owners. We
consider the various threat models introduced by this modification. We discover
that under a particularly practical threat model that covers numerous
scenarios, there exists a set of adaptive attacks that breach the data privacy
of any exact k-NN system. The vulnerability is a result of the mathematical
properties of k-NN and its output. Thus, we propose a privacy-preserving
alternative system supporting kernel density estimation using a Gaussian
kernel, a classification algorithm from the same family as k-NN. In many
applications, this similar algorithm serves as a good substitute for k-NN. We
additionally investigate solutions for other threat models, often through
extensions on prior single data owner systems.

space-times is interpreted as the sum of a $bulk$ field and a $shell$ field.
The $bulk$ part corresponds to a field sourced by the test charge placed in a
space-time without the shell. The $shell$ field accounts for the discontinuity
of the extrinsic curvature ${\kappa^p}_q$. An equivalent electric problem is
stated, in which the effect of the shell of matter on the field is
reconstructed with the electric potential produced by a non-gravitating charge
distribution of total image charge $Q$, to interpret the shell field in both
the interior and exterior regions of the space-time. The self-force on a point
charge $q$ in a locally flat geometry with a cylindrical thin-shell of matter
is calculated. The charge is repelled from the shell if
${\kappa^{p}}_{p}=\kappa<0$ (ordinary matter) and attracted toward the shell if
$\kappa>0$ (exotic matter). The total image charge is zero for exterior
problems, while for interior problems $Q/q=-\kappa \, r_e$, with $r_e$ the
external radius of the shell. The procedure is general and can be applied to
interpret self-forces in other space-times with shells, e.g., for locally flat
wormholes we found $Q_{\mp}^{wh}/q=-1/ (\kappa_{wh} r_{\pm})$.

not a simple proxy for Fe in DLAs and therefore not a suitable indicator of
dust depletion. After correcting for dust depletion, the majority of DLAs have
subsolar [Zn/Fe] similar to dSphs; (2) at [Fe/H]$\sim-0.5$, a constant
[Mn/Fe]$\sim-0.5$ and near-solar [$\alpha$/Fe] (requiring an assumption about
dust depletion) are in better agreement with dwarf galaxies than Galactic disc
stars; (3) [$\alpha$/Zn] is usually solar or subsolar in DLAs. However,
although low ratios of [$\alpha$/Fe] are usually considered more `dwarf-like'
than `Milky Way-like', subsolar [Zn/Fe] in Local Group dwarfs leads to
supersolar [$\alpha$/Zn] in the dSphs, in contrast with the DLAs. Therefore,
whilst DLAs exhibit some similarities with the Local Group dwarf population,

From a theoretical perspective, these methods are poorly understood, with the

complete nonlinear stability theory for the adaptive method, yielding Lyapunov
functions and geometric ergodicity under weak assumptions. We present numerical

of weakly nonlinear, dispersive waves. However, we show that systems which are
generally dispersive can have resonant sets of wave modes with identical group
velocities, leading to a local breakdown of dispersivity. This shows up as a
geometric singularity of the resonant manifold and possibly as an infinite
phase measure in the collision integral. Such singularities occur widely for
classical wave systems, including acoustical waves, Rossby waves, helical waves
in rotating fluids, light waves in nonlinear optics and also in quantum
transport, e.g. kinetics of electron-hole excitations (matter waves) in
graphene. These singularities are the exact analogue of the critical points
found by Van Hove in 1953 for phonon dispersion relations in crystals. The
importance of these singularities in wave kinetics depends on the dimension of
phase space $D=(N-2)d$ ($d$ physical space dimension, $N$ the number of waves
in resonance) and the degree of degeneracy $\delta$ of the critical points.
Following Van Hove, we show that non-degenerate singularities lead to finite
phase measures for $D>2$ but produce divergences when $D\leq 2$ and possible
breakdown of wave kinetics if the collision integral itself becomes too large
(or even infinite). Similar divergences and possible breakdown can occur for
degenerate singularities, when $D-\delta\leq 2,$ as we find for several
physical examples, including electron-hole kinetics in graphene. When the
standard kinetic equation breaks down, then one must develop a new singular
wave kinetics. We discuss approaches from pioneering 1971 work of Newell \&
Aucoin on multi-scale perturbation theory for acoustic waves and
field-theoretic methods based on exact Schwinger-Dyson integral equations for

self-interacting and partially directed self-avoiding walk, usually referred to
by the acronym IPDSAW and introduced in \cite{ZL68} by Zwanzig and Lauritzen to
study the collapse transition of an homopolymer dipped in a poor solvant.
  In \cite{POBG93}, physicists displayed numerical results concerning the
typical growth rate of some geometric features of the path as its length $L$
diverges. From this perspective the quantities of interest are the projections
of the path onto the horizontal axis (also called horizontal extension) and
onto the vertical axis for which it is useful to define the lower and the upper
envelopes of the path.
  With the help of a new random walk representation, we proved in \cite{CNGP13}
that the path grows horizontally like $\sqrt{L}$ in its collapsed regime and
that, once rescaled by $\sqrt{L}$ vertically and horizontally, its upper and
lower envelopes converge to some deterministic Wulff shapes.
  In the present paper, we bring the geometric investigation of the path
several steps further. In the extended regime, we prove a law of large number
for the horizontal extension of the polymer rescaled by its total length $L$,
we provide a precise asymptotics of the partition function and we show that its
lower and upper envelopes, once rescaled in time by $L$ and in space by
$\sqrt{L}$, converge to the same Brownian motion. At criticality, we identify
the limiting distribution of the horizontal extension rescaled by $L^{2/3}$ and
we show that the excess partition function decays as $L^{2/3}$ with an explicit
prefactor. In the collapsed regime, we identify the joint limiting distribution
of the fluctuations of the upper and lower envelopes around their associated
limiting Wulff shapes, rescaled in time by $\sqrt{L}$ and in space by
$L^{1/4}$.

from the central agent. In the mean field limit of a large number of local

that the probability of transition from one of the two stable quasi-equilibria

of site-specific structural characteristics have been proposed, most of which
are broadly related to either the density of contacts or the solvent
accessibility of individual residues. Most importantly, there has been
disagreement in the literature over the relative importance of solvent
accessibility and local packing density for explaining site-specific sequence
variability in proteins. We show here that this discussion has been confounded
by the definition of local packing density. The most commonly used measures of
local packing, such as the contact number and the weighted contact number,
represent by definition the combined effects of local packing density and
longer-range effects. As an alternative, we here propose a truly local measure
of packing density around a single residue, based on the Voronoi cell volume.
We show that the Voronoi cell volume, when calculated relative to the geometric
center of amino-acid side chains, behaves nearly identically to the relative
solvent accessibility, and both can explain, on average, approximately 34\% of
the site-specific variation in evolutionary rate in a data set of 209 enzymes.
An additional 10\% of variation can be explained by non-local effects that are
captured in the weighted contact number. Consequently, evolutionary variation
at a site is determined by the combined action of the immediate amino-acid
neighbors of that site and of effects mediated by more distant amino acids. We
conclude that instead of contrasting solvent accessibility and local packing
density, future research should emphasize the relative importance of immediate
contacts and longer-range effects on evolutionary variation.

required throwing away a sizable fraction of the data. This is because most
measurements have have relied on selecting nearly complete samples, where
variations in the composition of the galaxy population with seeing, depth, or
other survey characteristics are small.
  We introduce a new measurement method that aims to minimize this wastage,
allowing precision measurement for any class of stars or galaxies detectable in
an imaging survey. We have implemented our proposal in Balrog, a software
package which embeds fake objects in real imaging in order to accurately
characterize measurement biases.
  We demonstrate this technique with an angular clustering measurement using
Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. We first show that recovery of our injected
galaxies depends on a wide variety of survey characteristics in the same way as
the real data. We then construct a flux-limited sample of the faintest galaxies
in DES, chosen specifically for their sensitivity to depth and seeing
variations. Using the synthetic galaxies as randoms in the standard
Landy-Szalay correlation function estimator suppresses the effects of variable
survey selection by at least two orders of magnitude. With this correction, our
measured angular clustering is found to be in excellent agreement with that of
a matched sample drawn from much deeper, higher-resolution space-based
Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) imaging; over angular scales of
$0.004^{\circ} < \theta < 0.2^{\circ}$, we find a best-fit scaling amplitude
between the DES and COSMOS measurements of $1.00 \pm 0.09$.
  We expect this methodology to be broadly useful for extending the statistical
reach of measurements in a wide variety of coming imaging surveys.

however, is a very difficult task. Each instrument has its own data format,
software and analysis procedure, which are difficult to combine. It is for
example very challenging to perform a broadband fit of the energy spectrum of
the source. The Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework (3ML) aims to solve
this issue, providing a common framework which allows for a coherent modeling
of sources using all the available data, independent of their origin. At the
same time, thanks to its architecture based on plug-ins, 3ML uses the existing
official software of each instrument for the corresponding data in a way which
is transparent to the user. 3ML is based on the likelihood formalism, in which
a model summarizing our knowledge about a particular region of the sky is
convolved with the instrument response and compared to the corresponding data.
The user can choose between a frequentist analysis, and a Bayesian analysis. In
the former, parameters of the model are optimized in order to obtain the best
match to the data (i.e., the maximum of the likelihood). In the latter, the
priors specified by the user are used to build the posterior distribution,
which is then sampled with Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Multinest. Our
implementation of this idea is very flexible, allowing the study of point
sources as well as extended sources with arbitrary spectra. We will review the

be imprinted by the early conditions of formation rather than being only the
result of a recent morphological transformation driven by environmental
effects. We present precise star formation histories of a sample of Local Group
dwarf galaxies, derived from colour-magnitude diagrams reaching the oldest
main-sequence turnoffs. We argue that these galaxies can be assigned to two
basic types: fast dwarfs that started their evolution with a dominant and short
star formation event, and slow dwarfs that formed a small fraction of their
stars early and have continued forming stars until the present time (or
almost). These two different evolutionary paths do not map directly onto the
present-day morphology (dwarf spheroidal vs dwarf irregular). Slow and fast
dwarfs also differ in their inferred past location relative to the Milky Way
and/or M31, which hints that slow dwarfs were generally assembled in lower
density environments than fast dwarfs. We propose that the distinction between
a fast and slow dwarf galaxy reflects primarily the characteristic density of
the environment where they form. At a later stage, interaction with a large
host galaxy may play a role in the final gas removal and ultimate termination
of star formation.

of the energy band structure gives rise to shifts of the revival times in the

the dynamical evolution of the out of plane pseudospin polarization, which
measures the angular momentum transfer between light and graphene electrons.
For a coherent state, chosen as an initial pseudospin configuration, the
dynamics induces additional quantum revivals of the wave function that manifest
as shifts of the maxima and minima of the autocorrelation function, with
additional partial revivals and beating patterns. These additional maxima and

observed in the disk of HL Tau and two other young stellar objects. It is
usually interpreted as coming from magnetically aligned grains, but can also be
produced by dust scattering, as demonstrated explicitly by Kataoka et al. for
face-on disks. We extend their work by including the polarization induced by
disk inclination with respect to the line of sight. Using a physically
motivated, semi-analytic model, we show that the polarization fraction of the
scattered light increases with the inclination angle $i$, reaching $1/3$ for
edge-on disks. The inclination-induced polarization can easily dominate that
intrinsic to the disk in the face-on view. It provides a natural explanation
for the two main features of the polarization pattern observed in the tilted
disk of HL Tau ($i \sim 45^\circ$): the polarized intensity concentrating in a
region elongated more or less along the major axis, and polarization in this
region roughly parallel to the minor axis. This broad agreement provides
support to dust scattering as a viable mechanism for producing, at least in
part, polarized millimeter radiation. In order to produce polarization at the
observed level ($\sim 1\%$), the scattering grains must have grown to a maximum
size of tens of microns. However, such grains may be too small to produce the
opacity spectral index of $\beta \lesssim 1$ observed in HL Tau and other
sources; another population of larger, millimeter/centimeter-sized, grains may
be needed to explain the bulk of the unpolarized continuum emission.

Our focus is on reconstructing bandlimited graph signals, which are signals
that admit a sparse representation in a frequency domain related to the
structure of the graph. Most existing formulations focus on estimating an
unknown graph signal by observing its value on a subset of nodes. By contrast,
in this paper, we study the problem of reconstructing a known graph signal
using as input a graph signal that is non-zero only for a small subset of nodes
(seeding nodes). The sparse signal is then percolated (interpolated) across the
graph using a graph filter. Graph filters are a generalization of classical
time-invariant systems and represent linear transformations that can be
implemented distributedly across the nodes of the graph. Three setups are
investigated. In the first one, a single simultaneous injection takes place on
several nodes in the graph. In the second one, successive value injections take
place on a single node. The third one is a generalization where multiple nodes
inject multiple signal values. For noiseless settings, conditions under which
perfect reconstruction is feasible are given, and the corresponding schemes to
recover the desired signal are specified. Scenarios leading to imperfect
reconstruction, either due to insufficient or noisy signal value injections,
are also analyzed. Moreover, connections with classical interpolation in the
time domain are discussed. The last part of the paper presents numerical
experiments that illustrate the results developed through synthetic graph
signals and two real-world signal reconstruction problems: influencing opinions
in a social network and inducing a desired brain state in humans.

models using a gravity-model framework to explain spatiotemporal dynamics of
EVD in West Africa at both the national and district-level scales, and to
compare effectiveness of local interventions (e.g. local quarantine) and
long-range interventions (e.g. border-closures). Incorporating spatial
interactions, the gravity model successfully captures the multiple waves of
epidemic growth observed in Guinea. Model simulations indicate that
local-transmission reductions were most effective in Liberia, while long-range
transmission was dominant in Sierra Leone. The model indicates the presence of
spatial herd protection, wherein intervention in one region has a protective
effect on surrounding regions. The district-level intervention analysis
indicates the presence of intervention-amplifying regions, which provide
above-expected levels of reduction in cases and deaths beyond their borders.
The gravity-modeling approach accurately captured the spatial spread patterns
of EVD at both country and district levels, and helps to identify the most
effective locales for intervention. This model structure and intervention
analysis provides information that can be used by public health policymakers to
assist planning and response efforts for future epidemics.

spatio-temporal process has never been revealed. This is because the impact of
an electron will generate not only plasmons, but also photons, whose emission
cannot be achieved at a single space-time point, as fundamentally determined

quasar clustering remains similar over a decade in luminosity, contradicting a

most prominent classes of online selection problems. Partially linked to its
numerous applications in mechanism design, substantial interest arose also in
the study of nonlinear versions of MSP, with a focus on the submodular matroid
secretary problem (SMSP). So far, O(1)-competitive algorithms have been
obtained for SMSP over some basic matroid classes. This created some hope that,
analogously to the matroid secretary conjecture, one may even obtain
O(1)-competitive algorithms for SMSP over any matroid. However, up to now, most
questions related to SMSP remained open, including whether SMSP may be
substantially more difficult than MSP; and more generally, to what extend MSP
and SMSP are related.
  Our goal is to address these points by presenting general black-box
reductions from SMSP to MSP. In particular, we show that any O(1)-competitive
algorithm for MSP, even restricted to a particular matroid class, can be
transformed in a black-box way to an O(1)-competitive algorithm for SMSP over
the same matroid class. This implies that the matroid secretary conjecture is
equivalent to the same conjecture for SMSP. Hence, in this sense SMSP is not
harder than MSP. Also, to find O(1)-competitive algorithms for SMSP over a
particular matroid class, it suffices to consider MSP over the same matroid
class. Using our reductions we obtain many first and improved O(1)-competitive
algorithms for SMSP over various matroid classes by leveraging known algorithms

study the sensitivity of these distributions to top-quark couplings. We
determine individual limits on the dominant couplings, viz., the real part of
the CMDM $\mathrm{Re}\rho_2$, the imaginary part of the CEDM

quantities which are invariant under redefinition of fermion phases (we refer
to this redefinition as a change of basis for short), and therefore it is a
basis invariant treatment. The change of the anomaly terms due to the change of
the path integral measure [3,4] under a basis change is taken into account. We
find it is useful to go back and forth between different bases, and there are
insights which can be more easily obtained in one basis rather than another. A

  For the axion leptogenesis model [1], our result suggests that at $T >

$B-L$ created is controlled by the smallness of the sphaleron interaction rate,
$\Gamma_{B+L}$. Therefore it is not as efficient as described. In addition, we
notice an interesting modification of gauge boson dispersion relations at

is no conflict between the evidential consequences of the likelihood principle

evolution of the Internet. These SSDs contain both unstructured features (e.g.,
plain text) and metadata (e.g., tags). Most previous works focused on modeling
the unstructured text, and recently, some other methods have been proposed to
model the unstructured text with specific tags. To build a general model for
SSDs remains an important problem in terms of both model fitness and
efficiency. We propose a novel method to model the SSDs by a so-called
Tag-Weighted Topic Model (TWTM). TWTM is a framework that leverages both the
tags and words information, not only to learn the document-topic and topic-word
distributions, but also to infer the tag-topic distributions for text mining
tasks. We present an efficient variational inference method with an EM
algorithm for estimating the model parameters. Meanwhile, we propose three
large-scale solutions for our model under the MapReduce distributed computing
platform for modeling large-scale SSDs. The experimental results show the
effectiveness, efficiency and the robustness by comparing our model with the
state-of-the-art methods in document modeling, tags prediction and text
classification. We also show the performance of the three distributed solutions
in terms of time and accuracy on document modeling.

DW magnetization prior to reach stationary motion is smooth or abrupt. This
asymmetry affects the DW motion that can even reverse for a short period of
time. Additionally, it is found that the terminal speed in the case of the
current-driven dynamics may depend on either the initial DW magnetization
orientation at rest or the sign of the longitudinally injected current.

protein-protein interactions.The diseases are no exception to this. Identifying
one or more proteins for a particular disease and then designing a suitable
chemical compound (known as drug) to destroy these proteins has been an
interesting topic of research in bio-informatics. In previous methods, drugs
were designed using only seven chemical components and were represented as a
fixed-length tree. But in reality, a drug contains many chemical groups
collectively known as pharmacophore. Moreover, the chemical length of the drug
cannot be determined before designing the drug.In the present work, a Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) based methodology has been proposed to find out a
suitable drug for a particular disease so that the drug-protein interaction
becomes stable. In the proposed algorithm, the drug is represented as a
variable length tree and essential functional groups are arranged in different
positions of that drug. Finally, the structure of the drug is obtained and its
docking energy is minimized simultaneously. Also, the orientation of chemical
groups in the drug is tested so that it can bind to a particular active site of
a target protein and the drug fits well inside the active site of target
protein. Here, several inter-molecular forces have been considered for accuracy
of the docking energy. Results show that PSO performs better than the earlier
methods.

into account both the dust obscured and the unobscured star-formation, by
combining far-infrared (FIR), ultra-violet (UV) and H_alpha luminosity
functions up to high redshifts. We have also revisited the South Pole Telescope
(SPT) counts of dusty galaxies at 95\,GHz performing a detailed analysis of the

SKA1-MID surveys will detect high-z galaxies with SFRs two orders of magnitude
lower compared to Herschel surveys. The highest redshift tails of the

substantial fraction of strongly lensed galaxies. We predict that a survey down

will detect at least 2 images. The SKA1-MID will thus provide a comprehensive
view of the star formation history throughout the re-ionization epoch,
unaffected by dust extinction. We have also provided specific predictions for

In some stars the additional modes split into doublets, triplets or appear as a
more complex bands of increased power. Subharmonics of additional modes are

that allow covering a large portion of the network with a high probability
(e.g.~gossip based approaches). We identify principal metrics, provide a
theoretical model and perform the assessment evaluation using a high
performance simulator that is based on a parallel and distributed architecture.
A main point of this study is that our simulation model considers
implementation technical details, such as the use of caching and Time To Live
(TTL) in message dissemination, that are usually neglected in simulations, due
to the additional overhead they cause. Outcomes confirm that these technical
details have an important influence on the performance of dissemination schemes
and that the studied schemes are quite effective to spread information in P2P
overlay networks, whatever their topology. Moreover, the practical usage of
such dissemination mechanisms requires a fine tuning of many parameters, the
choice between different network topologies and the assessment of behaviors
such as free riding. All this can be done only using efficient simulation tools
to support both the network design phase and, in some cases, at runtime.

difference of the molecular size, causes an effective long-range interaction.
In spin-crossover (SC) compounds, local bistable states, i.e., high-spin and
low-spin states have different molecular sizes, and the elastic interaction is
important. In bipartite lattices, e.g., the square lattice, the ground state
can be two types of phases: ferromagnetic-like (FM) and antiferromagnetic-like
(AFM) phases. In systems like SC compounds, the former phase consists of all
small or large molecules, and the latter phase has the configuration of
alternating small and large molecules. In fact, both cases are observed in SC
systems. In this paper, we have studied the effect of the short-range
interaction in the elastic system on the properties of those order-disorder
phase transitions. We have obtained a phase diagram in the coordinates of the
temperature and the strength of the short-range interaction, including the
metastable structures. We show that effects of the short-range interaction are
essentially different for FM and AFM phase transitions. In the FM transition,
the long-range interaction of elasticity is relevant, and the system exhibits a
phase transition in the mean-filed universality class. In this case, the
long-range interaction strongly enhances the FM order, and it works
cooperatively with the short-range interaction. In contrast, in the AFM
transition, the elastic interaction slightly enhances the AFM order, but
essentially it does not contribute to the ordering, and the system shows a
transition in the Ising universality class. We have found that in the border
region between FM and AFM phases, the AFM phase has an advantage at finite
temperatures. We discuss the critical properties of two-step SC transitions
with comparison between the elastic interaction model and conventional SC
models (Ising-like models).

in the low corona gave rise to strong interplanetary (IP) type III bursts. We
analyze observations of three tiny events, detected by the Nan\c cay Radio
Heliograph (NRH), two of which produced IP type IIIs. We took advantage of the
NRH positioning information and of the high cadence of AIA/SDO data to identify
the associated EUV emissions. We measured positions and time profiles of the
metric and EUV sources. We found that the EUV events that produced IP type IIIs
were located near a coronal hole boundary, while the one that did not was
located in a closed magnetic field region. In all three cases tiny flaring
loops were involved, without any associated mass eruption. In the best observed
case the radio emission at the highest frequency (435 MHz) was displaced by
~55"" with respect to the small flaring loop. The metric type III emission shows
a complex structure in space and in time, indicative of multiple electron
beams, despite the low intensity of the events. From the combined analysis of
dynamic spectra and NRH images we derived the electron beam velocity as well as
the height, ambient plasma temperature and density at the level of formation of
the 160 MHz emission. From the analysis of the differential emission measure
derived from the AIA images we found that the first evidence of energy release
was at the footpoints and this was followed by the development of flaring loops
and subsequent cooling. We conclude that even small energy release events can
accelerate enough electrons to give rise to powerful IP type III bursts. The
proximity of the electron acceleration site to open magnetic field lines
facilitates the escape of the electrons into the interplanetary space. The
offset between the site of energy release and the metric type III location
warrants further investigation.

timescales, commonly known as microvariability, is still a widely debated
subject in high-energy astrophysics. Several competing scenarios have been
proposed to explain such occurrences, including various jet plasma
instabilities leading to the formation of shocks, magnetic reconnection sites,
and turbulence. In this letter we present the results of our detailed
investigation of a prominent, five-hour-long optical microflare detected during
recent WEBT campaign in 2014, March 2-6 targeting the blazar 0716+714. After
separating the flaring component from the underlying base emission continuum of
the blazar, we find that the microflare is highly polarized, with the
polarization degree $\sim (40-60)\%$$\pm (2-10)\%$, and the electric vector
position angle $\sim (10 - 20)$deg$\pm (1-8)$deg slightly misaligned with
respect to the position angle of the radio jet. The microflare evolution in the
$(Q,\,U)$ Stokes parameter space exhibits a looping behavior with a
counter-clockwise rotation, meaning polarization degree decreasing with the
flux (but higher in the flux decaying phase), and approximately stable
polarization angle. The overall very high polarization degree of the flare, its
symmetric flux rise and decay profiles, and also its structured evolution in
the $Q-U$ plane, all imply that the observed flux variation corresponds to a
single emission region characterized by a highly ordered magnetic field. As
discussed in the paper, a small-scale but strong shock propagating within the
outflow, and compressing a disordered magnetic field component, provides a
natural, though not unique, interpretation of our findings.

fixed depth normalized to $1$ buries a fixed number of objects among $n$
discrete locations. A Searcher who can dig to a total depth of $h$ searches the
locations with the aim of finding all of the hidden objects. If he does so, he
wins, otherwise the Hider wins. This zero-sum game is complicated to analyze
even for small values of its parameters, and for the case of $2$ hidden objects
has been completely solved only when the game is played in up to $3$ locations.
For some values of $h$ the solution of the game with $2$ objects hidden in $4$
locations is known, but the solution in the remaining cases was an open
question recently highlighted by Fokkink et al. Here we solve the remaining
cases of the game with $2$ objects hidden in $4$ locations. We also give some
more general results for the game, in particular using a geometrical argument
to show that when there are $2$ objects hidden in $n$ locations and $n
\rightarrow \infty$, the value of the game is asymptotically equal to $h/n$ for
$h \ge n/2$.

environments of primary (user) communications, where the channel states and
accessibility are usually stochastically distributed (benign or IID). However,
many practical CC are also exposed to disturbing events (contaminated) and
vulnerable jamming attacks (adversarial or non-IID). Thus, the channel state
distribution of spectrum could be stochastic, contaminated or adversarial at
different temporal and spatial locations. Without any a priori, facilitating
optimal CC is a very challenging issue. In this paper, we propose an online
learning algorithm that performs the joint channel sensing, probing and
adaptive channel access for multi-channel CC in general unknown environments.
We take energy-efficient CC (EECC) into our special attention, which is highly
desirable for green wireless communications and demanding to combat with
potential jamming attack who could greatly mar the energy and spectrum
efficiency of CC. The EECC is formulated as a constrained regret minimization
problem with power budget constraints. By tuning a novel exploration parameter,
our algorithms could adaptively find the optimal channel access strategies and
achieve the almost optimal learning performance of EECC in different scenarios
provided with the vanishing long-term power budget violations. We also consider
the important scenario that cooperative learning and information sharing among
multiple CR users to see further performance improvements. The proposed
algorithms are resilient to both oblivious and adaptive jamming attacks with
different intelligence and attacking strength. Extensive numerical results are
conducted to validate our theory.

uniformly at random an and/or Boolean expression of length n, built on a set of

satisfiable? asymptotically when n tends to infinity?
  The model of random Boolean expressions developed in the present paper is the
model of Boolean Catalan trees, already extensively studied in the literature
for a constant sequence (k_n)_{n\geq 1}. The fundamental breakthrough of this
paper is to generalise the previous results to any (reasonable) sequence of
integers (k_n)_{n\geq 1}, which enables us, in particular, to solve the above
satisfiability question.
  We also analyse the effect of introducing a natural equivalence relation on
the set of Boolean expressions. This new ""quotient"" model happens to exhibit a
very interesting threshold (or saturation) phenomenon at k_n = n/ln n.

provides a useful measure of the beam shape, which is mostly independent of

altitude and the dipole tilt distribution. The different structures of the

the conal model being several orders of magnitude less consistent with data
than the fan beam model. To bring the conal model into consistency with data,
strong effects of observational selection need to be called for, with 80% of Q

circuit and a second order pheromone mechanism in a foraging task is presented.
A neural circuit is trained for individual ants and subsequently the ants are
exposed to a virtual environment where a swarm of ants performed a resource
foraging task. The model comprises an associative and unsupervised learning
strategy for the neural circuit of the ant. The neural circuit adapts to the
environment by means of classical conditioning. The initially unknown
environment includes different types of stimuli representing food and obstacles
which, when they come in direct contact with the ant, elicit a reflex response
in the motor neural system of the ant: moving towards or away from the source
of the stimulus. The ants are released on a landscape with multiple food
sources where one ant alone would have difficulty harvesting the landscape to
maximum efficiency. The introduction of a double pheromone mechanism yields
better results than traditional ant colony optimization strategies. Traditional
ant systems include mainly a positive reinforcement pheromone. This approach
uses a second pheromone that acts as a marker for forbidden paths (negative
feedback). This blockade is not permanent and is controlled by the evaporation
rate of the pheromones. The combined action of both pheromones acts as a
collective stigmergic memory of the swarm, which reduces the search space of
the problem. This paper explores how the adaptation and learning abilities
observed in biologically inspired cognitive architectures is synergistically
enhanced by swarm optimization strategies. The model portraits two forms of
artificial intelligent behaviour: at the individual level the spiking neural
network is the main controller and at the collective level the pheromone
distribution is a map towards the solution emerged by the colony.

can have exceedingly long electron and nuclear spin coherence times. So far,
single-qubit gates for the nitrogen nuclear spin, a two-qubit gate with a
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electron spin, and entanglement between nearby
nitrogen nuclear spins have been demonstrated. Here, we develop a scheme to
implement a universal two-qubit gate between two distant nitrogen nuclear
spins. Virtual excitation of an NV center that is embedded in an optical cavity
can scatter a laser photon into the cavity mode; we show that this process
depends on the nuclear spin state of the nitrogen atom. If two NV centers are
simultaneously coupled to a common cavity mode and individually excited,
virtual cavity photon exchange can mediate an effective interaction between the
nuclear spin qubits, conditioned on the spin state of both nuclei, which
implements a universal controlled-$\textit{Z}$ gate. We predict operation times
below 100 nanoseconds, which is several orders of magnitude faster than the
decoherence time of nuclear spin qubits in diamond.

\emph{resource location problem}) is a challenge in complex networks due to
aspects as network size, unknown network topology, and network dynamics. The
problem is especially difficult if no requirements on the resource placement
strategy or the network structure are to be imposed, assuming of course that
keeping centralized resource information is not feasible or appropriate. Under
these conditions, random algorithms are useful to search the network. A
possible strategy for static networks, proposed in previous work, uses short
random walks precomputed at each network node as partial walks to construct
longer random walks with associated resource information. In this work, we
adapt the previous mechanisms to dynamic networks, where resource instances may
appear in, and disappear from, network nodes, and the nodes themselves may
leave and join the network, resembling realistic scenarios. We analyze the
resulting resource location mechanisms, providing expressions that accurately
predict average search lengths, which are validated using simulation
experiments. Reduction of average search lengths compared to simple random walk
searches are found to be very large, even in the face of high network
volatility. We also study the cost of the mechanisms, focusing on the overhead
implied by the periodic recomputation of partial walks to refresh the
information on resources, concluding that the proposed mechanisms behave
efficiently and robustly in dynamic networks.

open quantum systems (OQSs) which consist of some localized region that is
coupled to an external environment. Examples of such systems may be found in
numerous areas of physics including mesoscopic physics that provides the main
focus of this review. We provide a detailed discussion of the behavior of OQSs
in terms of the projection-operator formalism, according to which the system
under study is considered to be comprised of a localized region ($Q$), embedded
into a well-defined environment ($P$) of scattering wavefunctions (with
$Q+P=1$). The $Q$ subspace must be treated using the concepts of non-Hermitian
physics, and of particular interest here is: the capacity of the environment to
mediate a coupling between the different states of $Q$; the role played by the
presence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectra of OQSs; the influence of
EPs on the rigidity of the wavefunction phases, and; the ability of EPs to
initiate a dynamical phase transition (DPT). DPTs occur when the quantum
dynamics of the open system causes transitions between non-analytically
connected states, as a function of some external control parameter. In addition
to discussing experiments on mesoscopic quantum point contacts, we also review
manifestations of DPTs in mesoscopic devices and other systems. Other possible
manifestations of this phenomenon are presented. From these discussions a
generic picture of OQSs emerges in which the environmentally-mediated coupling
between different quantum states plays a critical role in governing the system
behavior.

perturbations are the consequence of the dynamics of a single scalar degree of

variations of the sound speed c_s (at which curvature fluctuations propagate)
and rapid variations of the expansion rate H during inflation. With this in
mind, we propose a non-trivial relation linking these two quantities that
allows us to study the generation of sharp features in realistic scenarios
where features are the result of the simultaneous occurrence of these two
sources. This relation depends on a single parameter with a value determined by
the particular model (and its numerical input) responsible for the rapidly
varying background. As a consequence, we find a one-parameter consistency
relation between the shape and size of features in the bispectrum and features
in the power spectrum. To substantiate this result, we discuss several examples
of models for which this one-parameter relation (between c_s and H) holds,
including models in which features in the spectra are both sudden and resonant.

single- and multi-trace operators. Ideals in the N=1 chiral ring correspond to
various branches and, in the large N limit, the operator counting reveals a
product of Fock spaces, including the Fock space of bosons on the space
transverse to the branes.

M33 galaxy using broad-band unresolved ground-based photometry, previous
studies mainly made use of simple stellar population models, shown in the
recent years to be oversimplified.
  Aims. In this study, we aim to derive the star cluster physical parameters
(age, mass, and extinction; metallicity is assumed to be LMC-like for clusters
with age below 1\,Gyr and left free for older clusters) of this galaxy using
models that take stochastic dispersion of cluster integrated colors into
account.
  Methods. We use three recently published M33 catalogs of cluster optical
broad-band photometry in standard $UBVRI$ and in CFHT/MegaCam $u^{*}g'r'i'z'$
photometric systems. We also use near-infrared $JHK$ photometry that we derive
from deep 2MASS images. We derive the cluster parameters using a method that
takes into account the stochasticity problem, presented in previous papers of
this series.
  Results. The derived differential age distribution of the M33 cluster
population is composed of a two-slope profile indicating that the number of
clusters decreases when age gets older. The first slope is interpreted as the
evolutionary fading phase of the cluster magnitudes, and the second slope as
the cluster disruption. The threshold between these two phases occurs at
$\sim$300\,Myrs, comparable to what is observed in the M31 galaxy. We also
model by use of artificial clusters the ability of the cluster physical
parameter derivation method to correctly derive the two-slope profile for
different photometric systems tested.

in parallel and deliver it in order at the receiver. When the delay on one or
more of the paths is variable, as is commonly the case, out of order arrivals
are frequent and head of line blocking leads to high latency. This is
exacerbated when packet loss, which is also common with wireless links, is
tackled using ARQ. This paper introduces Stochastic Earliest Delivery Path
First (S-EDPF), a resilient low delay packet scheduler for multipath transport
protocols. S-EDPF takes explicit account of the stochastic nature of paths and
uses this to minimise in-order delivery delay. S-EDPF also takes account of
FEC, jointly scheduling transmission of information and coded packets and in
this way allows lossy links to reduce delay and improve resiliency, rather than
degrading performance as usually occurs with existing multipath systems. We
implement S-EDPF as a multi-platform application that does not require
administration privileges nor modifications to the operating system and has
negligible impact on energy consumption. We present a thorough experimental
evaluation in both controlled environments and into the wild, revealing
dramatic gains in delay performance compared to existing approaches.

rounds each variable $x_i$ to 1 with probability $\overset{\sim}{x_i}$ and 0
otherwise. The expected value of the rounded objective function matches the
fractional optimum and no constraint is violated by more than $O(\frac{\log m}

$\overset{\sim}{x}$ to $\hat{x} \in {\{ 0,1\}}^{n}$ using a random walk, such
that the expected values of $\hat{x}_i$'s are consistent with the
Raghavan-Thompson rounding. In addition, it gives us intermediate values $x'$
which can then be used to bias the rounding towards a superior solution.The
reduced dependencies between the constraints of the sparser system can be
exploited using {\it Lovasz Local Lemma}. For $m$ randomly chosen packing
constraints in $n$ variables, with $k$ variables in each inequality, the
constraints are satisfied within $O(\frac{\log (mkp\log m/n) }{\log\log

explore trade-offs between approximation factors and error, and present

the existence question of an infinite family of $q$-analog of Steiner systems

  We exhibit a completely new method to attack this problem. In the process we
define a new family of designs whose existence is implied by the existence of
$q$-Steiner systems, but could exist even if the related $q$-Steiner systems do
not exist.
  The method is based on a possible system obtained by puncturing all the
subspaces of the $q$-Steiner system several times. We define the punctured
system as a new type of design and enumerate the number of subspaces of various
types that it might have. It will be evident that its existence does not imply
the existence of the related $q$-Steiner system. On the other hand, this type
of design demonstrates how close can we get to the related $q$-Steiner system.
  Necessary conditions for the existence of such designs are presented. These
necessary conditions will be also necessary conditions for the existence of the
related $q$-Steiner system. Trivial and nontrivial direct constructions and a
nontrivial recursive construction for such designs, are given. Some of the
designs have a symmetric structure, which is uniform in the dimensions of the
existing subspaces in the system. Most constructions are based on this uniform
structure of the design or its punctured designs. Finally, the structure of the

and patterns. Complex, multi-factorial models are commonly used to study
morphogenesis. It is difficult to understand the relation between the
uncertainty in the input and the output of such `black-box' models, giving rise
to the need for sensitivity analysis tools. In this paper, we introduce a
workflow for a global sensitivity analysis approach to study the impact of
single parameters and the interactions between them on the output of
morphogenesis models. To demonstrate the workflow, we used a published,
well-studied model of vascular morphogenesis. The parameters of the model
represent cell properties and behaviors that drive the mechanisms of angiogenic
sprouting. The global sensitivity analysis correctly identified the dominant
parameters in the model, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, the
analysis provides information on the relative impact of single parameters and
of interactions between them. The uncertainty in the output of the model was
largely caused by single parameters. The parameter interactions, although of
low impact, provided new insights in the mechanisms of \emph{in silico}
sprouting. Finally, the analysis indicated that the model could be reduced by
one parameter. We propose global sensitivity analysis as an alternative
approach to study and validate the mechanisms of morphogenesis. Comparison of
the ranking of the impact of the model parameters to knowledge derived from
experimental data and validation of manipulation experiments can help to
falsify models and to find the operand mechanisms in morphogenesis. The
workflow is applicable to all `black-box' models, including high-throughput
\emph{in vitro} models in which an output measure is affected by a set of
experimental perturbations.

significant difference between the response evoked by an audio-visual stimulus
combination and that evoked by the most effective of its components
individually. Crossmodal enhancement is commonly expressed as a proportion of
the strongest unisensory response. However, being responsive to multiple
sensory modalities does not guarantee that a neuron has actually engaged in
integrating its multiple sensory inputs, rather than simply responding to the
most salient stimulus. Here, we propose an alternative index measuring by how
much the crossmodal response surpasses the level obtainable by optimally
combining the unisensory responses. Optimality is defined by probability
summation combining the unisensory responses under maximal negative stochastic
dependence. The new index is analogous to measuring crossmodal enhancement by
the amount of violation of the ""race model inequality"", which is widely used in
reaction time studies of multisensory integration. Neurons previously labeled
as ""multisensory"" may lose that property since the new index tends to be
smaller than the traditional one. This is exemplified with a data set collected
from single SC neurons. The new easy-to-compute index does not require any
specific distributional assumption. It is sensitive to the variability in the
data, in contrast to the traditional index which, by definition, only depends
on the means of the uni- and crossmodal response distributions.

which is, so far, the largest in M51. There is a correlation between infrared
emission (star formation rate indicator) and HCN (1--0) emission (dense gas
tracer) at kpc scale in M51, a natural extension of the proportionality between
the star formation rate (SFR) and the dense gas mass established globally in
galaxies. Within M51, the relation appears to be sub-linear (with a slope of
0.74$\pm$0.16) as $L_{\rm IR}$ rises less quickly than $L_{\rm HCN}$. We
attribute this to a difference between center and outer disk such that the
central regions have stronger HCN (1--0) emission per unit star formation. The
IR-HCN correlation in M51 is further compared with global one from Milky Way to
high-z galaxies and bridges the gap between giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and
galaxies. Like the centers of nearby galaxies, the $L_{\rm IR}$/$L_{\rm HCN}$
ratio measured in M51 (particularly in the central regions), is slightly lower
than what is measured globally in galaxies, yet is still within the scatter.
This implies that though the $L_{\rm IR}$/$L_{\rm HCN}$ ratio varies as a

massive gluons, but only hadron-like bound states of sigma-model particles. The
reason is that the gluon mass diverges, being proportional to the two-point
correlation function of the renormalized field of the sigma model at $x=0$. We
use exact large-$N$ results to show that after introducing a lattice
regularization and typical values of the coupling constants used in Monte Carlo
simulations, the gluon mass becomes finite, and even sometimes small. A smooth
crossover into a Higgs phase can then appear. For small volumes and large $N$,
we find an analytic expression for the gluon mass, which depends on the

qualitatively similar to the one observed in lattice computations at $N=2$.

  This paper introduces a new set of tools to investigate whether intrinsic
PUFs can be found in PC components that are not advertised as containing PUFs.
In particular, this paper investigates AMD64 CPU registers as potential PUF
sources in the operating-system kernel, the bootloader, and the system BIOS;
investigates the CPU cache in the early boot stages; and investigates shared
memory on Nvidia GPUs. This investigation found non-random non-fingerprinting
behavior in several components but revealed usable PUFs in Nvidia GPUs.

channels of multianode photomultiplier tube (MAPMT) R5900U-00-L16 which has
typical rise time of 0.6 ns and effective area of 0.8x16 mm for a single anode

algorithm with and without channel inconsistency. Then we calibrate the channel
inconsistency and verify the algorithm using general current signal processor
Libera Photon in low-speed scheme. Finally we get turn-by-turn beam size and
position and calculate the vertical tune in high-speed scheme. The experimental
results show that measured values fit well with simulation results after
channel differences are calibrated and the fractional part of the tune in
vertical direction is 0.3628 which is very close to the nominal value 0.3621.

are applied to the model of passive vector (magnetic) field advected by a
random turbulent velocity field. The latter is governed by the Navier--Stokes
equation for compressible fluid, subject to external random force with the
covariance $\propto \delta(t-t') k^{4-d-y}$, where $d$ is the dimension of
space and $y$ is an arbitrary exponent. From physics viewpoints, the model
describes magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the so-called kinematic
approximation, where the effects of the magnetic field on the dynamics of the
fluid are neglected. The original stochastic problem is reformulated as a
multiplicatively renormalizable field theoretic model; the corresponding
renormalization group equations possess an infrared attractive fixed point. It
is shown that various correlation functions of the magnetic field and its
powers demonstrate anomalous scaling behavior in the inertial-convective range
already for small values of~$y$. The corresponding anomalous exponents,
identified with scaling (critical) dimensions of certain composite fields
(""operators"" in the quantum-field terminology), can be systematically
calculated as series in $y$. The practical calculation is performed in the
leading one-loop approximation, including exponents in anisotropic
contributions. It should be emphasized that, in contrast to Gaussian ensembles
with finite correlation time, the model and the perturbation theory presented
here are manifestly Galilean covariant.

which requires efficient methods for real time applications. The complexity
considered in this paper is when there is a large number of measurements which
are required to be processed at each time step. Sequential Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) has been shown to be a promising approach to target tracking in
complex environments, especially when dealing with clutter. However, a large
number of measurements usually results in large processing requirements. This
paper goes beyond the current state-of-the-art and presents a novel Sequential
MCMC approach that can overcome this challenge through adaptively subsampling
the set of measurements. Instead of using the whole large volume of available
data, the proposed algorithm performs a trade off between the number of
measurements to be used and the desired accuracy of the estimates to be
obtained in the presence of clutter. We show results with large improvements in
processing time, more than 40% with a negligible loss in tracking performance,
compared with the solution without subsampling.

bright (V=5.5) and close-by (6.5 pc) star HD219134. This is the first result of
the Rocky Planet Search program with HARPS-N on the TNG in La Palma. The inner
planet orbits the star in 3.0937 +/-0.0004 days, on a quasi-circular orbit with
a semi-major axis of 0.0382 +/- 0.0003 AU. Spitzer observations allowed us to
detect the transit of the planet in front of the star making HD219134b the
nearest known transiting planet to date. From the amplitude of the
radial-velocity variation (2.33 +/- 0.24 m/s) and observed depth of the transit
(359 +/- 38 ppm), the planet mass and radius are estimated to be 4.46 +/- 0.47
M_{\oplus} and 1.606 +/- 0.086 R_{\oplus} leading to a mean density of 5.89 +/-
1.17 g/cc, suggesting a rocky composition. One additional planet with minimum
mass of 2.67 +/- 0.59 M_{\oplus} moves on a close-in, quasi-circular orbit with
a period of 6.765 +/- 0.005 days. The third planet in the system has a period

this planet is close to the rotational period of the star estimated from
variations of activity indicators (42.3 +/- 0.1 days). The planetary origin of
the signal is, however, the preferred solution as no indication of variation at
the corresponding frequency is observed for activity-sensitive parameters.
Finally, a fourth additional longer-period planet of mass of 62 +/- 6
M_{\oplus} orbits the star in 1190 days, on an eccentric orbit (e=0.27 +/-

relativistic outflows, with velocities up to 0.2c. These manifest, in about 15%
of quasars, as absorption troughs on the blue side of UV emission lines, such
as C iv and Mg ii. In this work, we complement the information collected in the
cm band for our previously presented sample of radio loud BAL QSOs with new
observations at m and mm bands. Our aim is to verify the presence of old,
extended radio components in the MHz range, and probe the emission of dust
(linked to star formation) in the mm domain. We observed 5 sources from our
sample, already presenting hints of low-frequency emission, with the GMRT at
235 and 610 MHz. Other 17 sources (more than half the sample) were observed
with bolometer cameras at IRAM-30m and APEX. All sources observed with the GMRT
present extended emission at a scale of tens of kpc. In some cases these
measurements allow us to identify a second component in the SED, at frequencies
below 1.4 GHz, beyond the one already studied in the GHz domain. In the
mm-band, only one source shows emission clearly ascribable to dust. Upper
limits were obtained for the remaining targets. These findings confirm that BAL
QSOs can also be present in old radio sources, or even in restarting ones,
where favourable conditions for the outflow launching/acceleration are present.
A suggestion that these outflows could be precursors of the jet comes from the
fact that ~70% of our sample can be considered in a GigaHertz Peaked Spectrum
(GPS) or Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS)+GPS phase. This would confirm the idea
proposed by other authors that these outflows could be recollimated to form the
jet. Comparing with previous works in the literature, dust emission seems to be
weaker than the what expected in 'normal' QSOs, suggesting that a feedback
mechanism could inhibit star formation in radio-loud BAL QSOs.

The photolysis of hydrogenated amorphous carbon, a-C(:H), dust by UV
photon-irradiation in the laboratory leads to the release of H2 as well as
other molecules and radicals. This same process is also likely to be important
in the interstellar medium. Aims. To investigate molecule formation arising
from the photo-dissociatively-driven, regenerative processing of a-C(:H) dust.
Methods. We explore the mechanism of a-C(:H) grain photolysis leading to the
formation of H2 and other molecules/radicals. Results. The rate constant for
the photon-driven formation of H2 from a-C(:H) grains is estimated to be
2x10^-17 cm^3 s^-1. In intense radiation fields photon-driven grain
decomposition will lead to fragmentation into daughter species rather than H2
formation. Conclusions. The cyclic re-structuring of arophatic a-C(:H)
nano-particles appears to be a viable route to formation of H2 for low to
moderate radiation field intensities (1 < G_0 < 10^2), even when the dust is
warm (T ~ 50 - 100 K).

two lower frequency collective excitations; it represents the only decay mode
for a bosonic collective excitation in a superfluid at T = 0. The standard
treatment for this decay assumes a linear spectrum, which in turn implies that
the final state momenta must be collinear to the initial state. We extend this
treatment, showing that the inclusion of a gradient term in the Hamiltonian
yields a realistic spectrum for the bosonic excitations; we then derive a
formula for the decay rate of such excitations, and show that even moderate
nonlinearities in the spectrum can yield substantial deviations from the
standard result. We apply our result to an attractive Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC
crossover: here the low-energy bosonic collective excitations are density
oscillations driven by the phase of the pairing order field. These collective
excitations, which are gapless modes as a consequence of the Goldstone
mechanism, have a spectrum which is well established both theoretically and
experimentally, and whose linewidth, we show, is determined at low temperatures
by the Beliaev decay mechanism.

  Analysis of Linguistic Subsystems",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, the focus of complex networks research has shifted from the
analysis of isolated properties of a system toward a more realistic modeling of
multiple phenomena - multilayer networks. Motivated by the prosperity of
multilayer approach in social, transport or trade systems, we propose the
introduction of multilayer networks for language. The multilayer network of
language is a unified framework for modeling linguistic subsystems and their
structural properties enabling the exploration of their mutual interactions.
Various aspects of natural language systems can be represented as complex
networks, whose vertices depict linguistic units, while links model their
relations. The multilayer network of language is defined by three aspects: the
network construction principle, the linguistic subsystem and the language of
interest. More precisely, we construct a word-level (syntax, co-occurrence and
its shuffled counterpart) and a subword level (syllables and graphemes) network
layers, from five variations of original text (in the modeled language). The
obtained results suggest that there are substantial differences between the
networks structures of different language subsystems, which are hidden during
the exploration of an isolated layer. The word-level layers share structural
properties regardless of the language (e.g. Croatian or English), while the
syllabic subword level expresses more language dependent structural properties.
The preserved weighted overlap quantifies the similarity of word-level layers
in weighted and directed networks. Moreover, the analysis of motifs reveals a
close topological structure of the syntactic and syllabic layers for both
languages. The findings corroborate that the multilayer network framework is a
powerful, consistent and systematic approach to model several linguistic
subsystems simultaneously and hence to provide a more unified view on language.

inner regions (<10AU) are rich in small organic volatiles (e.g., C2H2 and HCN).
Trends in the data suggest that disks around cooler stars (~3000K) are
potentially more carbon- and molecule-rich than their hotter counterparts. Our
aims are to explore the composition of the planet-forming region of disks
around stars from M dwarf to Herbig Ae and compare with the observed trends.
Models of the disk physical structure are coupled with a gas-grain chemical
network to map the abundances in the planet-forming zone. N2 self shielding,
X-ray-induced chemistry, and initial abundances, are investigated. The
composition in the 'observable' atmosphere is compared with that in the
midplane where the planet-building reservoir resides. M dwarf disk atmospheres
are relatively more molecule rich than those for T Tauri or Herbig Ae disks.
The weak far-UV flux helps retain this complexity which is enhanced by
X-ray-induced ion-molecule chemistry. N2 self shielding has only a small effect
and does not explain the higher C2H2/HCN ratios observed towards cooler stars.
The models underproduce the OH/H2O column density ratios constrained in Herbig
Ae disks, despite reproducing the absolute value for OH: H2O self shielding
only increases this discrepency. The disk midplane content is sensitive to the
initial main elemental reservoirs. The gas in the inner disk is generally more
carbon rich than the midplane ices and is most significant for disks around
cooler stars. The atmospheric C/O ratio appears larger than it actually is when
calculated using observable tracers only because gas-phase O2 is predicted to
be a significant oxygen reservoir. The models suggest that the gas in the inner
regions of disks around cooler stars is more carbon rich; however, calculations
of the molecular emission are necessary to confirm the observed trends.

converted by photolysis into the present N2 dominated atmosphere, is an
important problem in planetary science. Recently Gilliam and Lerman (2014)
estimated escape driven by the surface temperature and pressure, which we show
gave loss rates that are orders of magnitude too large. Their model, related to
Jeans escape from an isothermal atmosphere, was used to show that escape driven
only by surface heating would deplete the atmospheric inventory of N for a
suggested Titan accretion temperature of ~355 K. Therefore, they concluded that
the accretion temperature must be lower in order to retain the present Titan
atmosphere. Here we show that the near surface atmospheric temperature is
essentially irrelevant for determining the atmospheric loss rate from Titan and
that escape is predominantly driven by solar heating of the upper atmosphere.
We also give a rough estimate of the escape rate in the early solar system
(~10^4 kg/s) consistent with an inventory of nitrogen being available over the

forget things effortlessly. We also demonstrate a new non-volatile,
charge-based memory scheme wherein the erasure can be associated with even
negative energy dissipation; this implies that the memory's environment is
cooled during information erasure and contradicts Landauer's principle of
erasure dissipation. On the other hand, writing new information into the memory
always requires positive energy dissipation in our schemes. Finally, we show a
simple system where even a classical erasure process yields negative energy
dissipation of arbitrarily large energy.

approaches to search for biomarkers, but because single-molecule biomarkers
have shown a disappointing lack of robustness for clinical diagnosis,
researchers have begun searching for distinctive sets of molecules, called
""biosignatures"". However, the most popular statistics are not appropriate for
their identification, and the number of possible biosignatures to be tested is
frequently intractable. In the present work, we developed a ""multivariate
filter"" using genetic algorithms (GA) as a feature (gene) selector to optimize
a measure of intra-group cohesion and inter-group dispersion. This method was
implemented using Python and R (pyBioSig, available at
https://github.com/fredgca/pybiosig under LGPL) and can be manipulated via
graphical interface or Python scripts. Using it, we were able to identify
putative biosignatures composed by just a few genes and capable of recovering
multiple groups simultaneously in a hierarchical clustering, even ones that
were not recovered using the whole transcriptome, within a feasible length of
time using a personal computer. Our results allowed us to conclude that using
GA to optimize our new intra-group cohesion and inter-group dispersion measure
is a clear, effective, and computationally feasible strategy for the
identification of putative ""omical"" biosignatures that could support
discrimination among multiple groups simultaneously.

which is either a randomly chosen permutation or a randomly chosen function.
When queried by an $n$-bit string $w$, the oracle computes $f(w)$, truncates
the $m$ last bits, and returns only the first $n-m$ bits of $f(w)$. How many
queries does a querying adversary need to submit in order to distinguish the
truncated permutation from a random function?
  In 1998, Hall et al. showed an algorithm for determining (with high
probability) whether or not $f$ is a permutation, using $O(2^{\frac{m+n}{2}})$
queries. They also showed that if $m < n/7$, a smaller number of queries will
not suffice. For $m > n/7$, their method gives a weaker bound. In this
manuscript, we show how a modification of the method used by Hall et al. can
solve the porblem completely. It extends the result to essentially every $m$,
showing that $\Omega(2^{\frac{m+n}{2}})$ queries are needed to get a
non-negligible distinguishing advantage. We recently became aware that a better
bound for the distinguishing advantage, for every $m<n$, follows from a result
of Stam published, in a different context, already in 1978.

pure triple interactions, in the sense that they cannot be explained in terms

of three binary variables with high triple interaction. The analysis also
allows us to quantify the amount of redundancy in the mutual information
between pairs of variables, and to assess whether the information between two
variables is or is not mediated by a third variable. These concepts are applied
to the analysis of written texts. We find that the probability that a given
word is found in a particular location within the text is not only modulated by
the presence or absence of other nearby words, but also, on the presence or

represented by appropriate adaptation of their internal dynamical structure to
corresponding local stress-energy-momentum balance relations with other
physical objects. This adaptation process has two aspects: internal and
external. Clearly, finding adequate internal dynamical structure giving
appropriate integral characteristics of the object, will bring also appropriate
behavior of EMFO as a whole. Therefore, the internal local
stress-energy-momentum balance among the subsystems of EMFO should formally be
presented by appropriately defined tensor-field quantities, which are meant to
suggest a dynamical understanding of the abilities of EMFO to successfully
communicate with all the rest physical world.

theory and demonstrate its inner consistency, natural simplicity and
fundamental connection to classical mechanics. This hopefully will help the
scientific community to overcome any ambiguity and skepticism about this
theory, especially the validity of the skew-symmetric character of the
couple-stress tensor. We demonstrate that in a consistent continuum mechanics,
the response of infinitesimal elements of matter at each point decomposes
naturally into a rigid body portion, plus the relative translation and rotation
of these elements at adjacent points of the continuum. This relative
translation and rotation captures the deformation in terms of stretches and
curvatures, respectively. As a result, the continuous displacement field and
its corresponding rotation field are the primary variables, which remarkably is
in complete alignment with rigid body mechanics, thus providing a unifying
basis. For further clarification, we also examine the deviatoric symmetric
couple stress theory that, in turn, provides more insight on the fundamental
aspects of consistent continuum mechanics.

availability of data, over the last two decades, the field of network science
has established itself as an own area of research. With quantitative scientists
from computer science, mathematics, and physics working on datasets from
biology, economics, sociology, political sciences, and many others, network
science serves as a paradigm for interdisciplinary research. One of the major
goals in network science is to unravel the relationship between topological
graph structure and a network's function. As evidence suggests, systems from
the same fields, i.e. with similar function, tend to exhibit similar structure.
However, it is still vague whether a similar graph structure automatically
implies likewise function. This dissertation aims at helping to bridge this
gap, while particularly focusing on the role of triadic structures. After a
general introduction to the main concepts of network science, existing work
devoted to the relevance of triadic substructures is reviewed. A major
challenge in modeling such structure is the fact that not all three-node
subgraphs can be specified independently of each other, as pairs of nodes may
participate in multiple triadic subgraphs. In order to overcome this obstacle,
a novel class of generative network models based on pair-disjoint triadic
building blocks is suggested. It is further investigated whether triad motifs -
subgraph patterns which appear significantly more frequently than expected at
random - occur homogeneously or heterogeneously distributed over graphs.
Finally, the influence of triadic substructure on the evolution of dynamical
processes acting on their nodes is studied. It is observed that certain motifs
impose clear signatures on the systems' dynamics, even when embedded in a
larger network structure.
