fluctuations at spatial scales near the proton inertial length $d_p$ may be
considered as Kinetic Alfv\'en waves (KAWs). In the present paper, we show how
phase-mixing of large-scale parallel propagating Alfv\'en waves is an efficient
mechanism for the production of KAWs at wavelengths close to $d_p$ and at large
propagation angle with respect to the magnetic field. Magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD), Hall-Magnetohydrodynamic (HMHD), and hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell (HVM)
simulations modeling the propagation of Alfv\'en waves in inhomogeneous plasmas
are performed. In linear regime, the role of dispersive effects is singled out
by comparing MHD and HMHD results. Fluctuations produced by phase-mixing are
identified as KAWs through a comparison of polarization of magnetic
fluctuations and wave group velocity with analytical linear predictions. In the
nonlinear regime, comparison of HMHD and HVM simulations allows to point out
the role of kinetic effects in shaping the proton distribution function. We
observe generation of temperature anisotropy with respect to the local magnetic
field and production of field-aligned beams. The regions where the proton
distribution function highly departs from thermal equilibrium are located
inside the shear layers, where the KAWs are excited, this suggesting that the
distortions of the proton distribution are driven by a resonant interaction of
protons with KAW fluctuations. Our results are relevant in configurations where
magnetic field inhomogeneities are present, as, for example, in the solar
corona where the presence of Alfv\'en waves has been ascertained.

sl_2-theory of complex semisimple finite-dimensional Lie algebras due to
Jacobson--Morozov and Kostant can be extended to positive characteristic. This
builds on work of Pommerening and improves significantly upon previous attempts
due to Springer--Steinberg and Carter/Spaltenstein. Our main advance arises by
investigating quite fully the extent to which subalgebras of the Lie algebras
of semisimple algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields k are
G-completely reducible, a notion essentially due to Serre. For example if G is
exceptional and char k=p\geq 5, we classify the triples (\h,\g,p) such that
there exists a non-G-completely reducible subalgebra of \g isomorphic to \h. We
do this also under the restriction that \h be a p-subalgebra of \g. We find
that the notion of subalgebras being G-completely reducible effectively
characterises when it is possible to find bijections between the conjugacy
classes of sl_2-subalgebras and nilpotent orbits and it is this which allows us
to prove our main theorems.
  For absolute completeness, we also show that there is essentially only one
occasion in which a nilpotent element cannot be extended to an sl_2-triple when
p\geq 3: this happens for the exceptional orbit in G_2 when p=3.

become a rich repository of mathematical formulae. This necessitates the
creation of robust and scalable systems for Mathematical Information Retrieval,
where users search for mathematical information using individual formulae
(query-by-expression) or a combination of keywords and formulae. Often, the
pages that best satisfy users' information needs contain expressions that only
approximately match the query formulae. For users trying to locate or re-find a
specific expression, browse for similar formulae, or who are mathematical
non-experts, the similarity of formulae depends more on the relative positions
of symbols than on deep mathematical semantics.
  We propose the Maximum Subtree Similarity (MSS) metric for
query-by-expression that produces intuitive rankings of formulae based on their
appearance, as represented by the types and relative positions of symbols.
Because it is too expensive to apply the metric against all formulae in large
collections, we first retrieve expressions using an inverted index over tuples
that encode relationships between pairs of symbols, ranking hits using the Dice
coefficient. The top-k formulae are then re-ranked using MSS. Our approach
obtains state-of-the-art performance on the NTCIR-11 Wikipedia formula

affects phase-locking of waves that is crucial for the mechanistic

an undirected, unweighted graph such that the distance between any pair of
vertices can be decoded solely from their labels. We propose a series of new
labeling schemes within the framework of so-called hub labeling (HL, also known
as landmark labeling or 2-hop-cover labeling), in which each node $u$ stores
its distance to all nodes from an appropriately chosen set of hubs $S(u)
\subseteq V$. For a queried pair of nodes $(u,v)$, the length of a shortest
$u-v$-path passing through a hub node from $S(u)\cap S(v)$ is then used as an
upper bound on the distance between $u$ and $v$.
  We present a hub labeling which allows us to decode exact distances in sparse
graphs using labels of size sublinear in the number of nodes. For graphs with
at most $n$ nodes and average degree $\Delta$, the tradeoff between label bit
size $L$ and query decoding time $T$ for our approach is given by $L = O(n \log
\log_\Delta T / \log_\Delta T)$, for any $T \leq n$. Our simple approach is
thus the first sublinear-space distance labeling for sparse graphs that
simultaneously admits small decoding time (for constant $\Delta$, we can
achieve any $T=\omega(1)$ while maintaining $L=o(n)$), and it also provides an
improvement in terms of label size with respect to previous slower approaches.
  By using similar techniques, we then present a $2$-additive labeling scheme
for general graphs, i.e., one in which the decoder provides a
2-additive-approximation of the distance between any pair of nodes. We achieve
almost the same label size-time tradeoff $L = O(n \log^2 \log T / \log T)$, for
any $T \leq n$. To our knowledge, this is the first additive scheme with
constant absolute error to use labels of sublinear size. The corresponding
decoding time is then small (any $T=\omega(1)$ is sufficient).

Chain Monte Carlo methods for posterior inference. The typical nonlinear
concentration of posterior measure observed in many such Inverse Problems
presents severe challenges to existing simulation based inference methods.
Motivated by these challenges the exploitation of local geometric information
in the form of covariant gradients, metric tensors, Levi-Civita connections,
and local geodesic flows, have been introduced to more effectively locally
explore the configuration space of the posterior measure. However, obtaining
such geometric quantities usually requires extensive computational effort and
despite their effectiveness affect the applicability of these
geometrically-based Monte Carlo methods. In this paper we explore one way to
address this issue by the construction of an emulator of the model from which
all geometric objects can be obtained in a much more computationally feasible
manner. The main concept is to approximate the geometric quantities using a
Gaussian Process emulator which is conditioned on a carefully chosen design set
of configuration points, which also determines the quality of the emulator. To
this end we propose the use of statistical experiment design methods to refine
a potentially arbitrarily initialized design online without destroying the
convergence of the resulting Markov chain to the desired invariant measure. The
practical examples considered in this paper provide a demonstration of the
significant improvement possible in terms of computational loading suggesting
this is a promising avenue of further development.

estimating the heritability which corresponds to the proportion of phenotypic
variance which can be explained by genetic factors. Estimating this quantity
for neuroanatomical features is a fundamental challenge in psychiatric disease
research. Since the phenotypic variations may only be due to a small fraction
of the available genetic information, we propose an estimator of the
heritability that can be used in high dimensional sparse linear mixed models.
Our method consists of three steps. Firstly, a variable selection stage is
performed in order to recover the support of the genetic effects -- also called
causal variants -- that is to find the genetic effects which really explain the
phenotypic variations. Secondly, we propose a maximum likelihood strategy for
estimating the heritability which only takes into account the causal genetic
effects found in the first step. Thirdly, we compute the standard error and the
95% confidence interval associated to our heritability estimator thanks to a
nonparametric bootsrap approach. Our main contribution consists in providing an
estimation of the heritability with standard errors substantially smaller than
methods without variable selection when the genetic effects are very sparse.
Since the real genetic architecture is in general unknown in practice, we also
propose an empirical criterion which allows the user to decide whether it is
relevant to apply a variable selection based approach or not. We illustrate the
performance of our methodology on synthetic and real neuroanatomic data coming
from the Imagen project. We also show that our approach has a very low
computational burden and is very efficient from a statistical point of view.

for synthesizing robust hybrid control strategies for nonlinear systems. Most
existing methods for computing finite abstractions utilize some global,
analytical function to provide bounds on the reachable sets of nonlinear
systems, which can be conservative and lead to spurious transitions in the
abstract systems. This problem is even more pronounced in the presence of
imperfect measurements and modelling uncertainties, where control synthesis can
easily become infeasible due to added spurious transitions. To mitigate this
problem, we propose to compute finite abstractions with robustness margins by
over-approximating the local reachable sets of nonlinear systems. We do so by
linearizing the nonlinear dynamics into linear affine systems and keeping track

prove that any nilpotent singularity of codimension three in $\mathbb{R}^3$

must adequately represent the wave interaction behaviour in the composite

may influence the behavior of subsequent generations in Drosophila. Using
genetic and anatomic techniques, I find that both first- and second-generation

days displayed a distinct response bias to the same specific trained odors. The
offspring displayed an enhanced anemotactic approach response to the trained
odors, however, and did not differentiate between orders based on whether
parental training was aversive or appetitive. Consequently, disruption of both
olfactory-receptor and dorsal-paired-medial neuron input into the mushroom
bodies abolished this change in offspring response, but disrupting synaptic
output from a/b neurons of the mushroom body themselves had little effect on
behavior even though they remained necessary for enacting newly trained
conditioned responses. These observations identify a unique transgenerational
dissociation between parentally-trained conditioned and unconditioned sensory
stimuli, and provide a putative neural basis for how sensorimotor experiences
in insects may bias the behavior of subsequent generations.

science and for a wide range of technological applications. Chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) is currently the only working approach to grow graphene at
wafer scale, which is required for industrial applications. Unfortunately, CVD
graphene is intrinsically polycrystalline, with pristine graphene grains
stitched together by disordered grain boundaries, which can be either a
blessing or a curse. On the one hand, grain boundaries are expected to degrade
the electrical and mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene, rendering
the material undesirable for many applications. On the other hand, they exhibit
an increased chemical reactivity, suggesting their potential application to
sensing or as templates for synthesis of one-dimensional materials. Therefore,
it is important to gain a deeper understanding of the structure and properties
of graphene grain boundaries. Here, we review experimental progress on
identification and electrical and chemical characterization of graphene grain
boundaries. We use numerical simulations and transport measurements to
demonstrate that electrical properties and chemical modification of graphene
grain boundaries are strongly correlated. This not only provides guidelines for
the improvement of graphene devices, but also opens a new research area of
engineering graphene grain boundaries for highly sensitive electrobiochemical
devices.

GeV. Two-particle correlations, where the particles have a large separation in

indicate that collective effects dominate the second and third Fourier
components for the correlations observed in the $^{3}$He$+$Au system. The
collective behavior is quantified in terms of elliptic $v_2$ and triangular
$v_3$ anisotropy coefficients measured with respect to their corresponding
event planes. The $v_2$ values are comparable to those previously measured in
$d$$+$Au collisions at the same nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy.
Comparison with various theoretical predictions are made, including to models
where the hot spots created by the impact of the three $^{3}$He nucleons on the
Au nucleus expand hydrodynamically to generate the triangular flow. The
agreement of these models with data may indicate the formation of low-viscosity
quark-gluon plasma even in these small collision systems.

interval graphs. Recall that such a graph is defined by letting $X_{1},\ldots
X_{n},Y_{1},\ldots Y_{n}$ be $2n$ independent random variables, with uniform
distribution on $[0,1]$. We then say that the $i$th of the $n$ vertices is the
interval $[X_{i},Y_{i}]$ if $X_{i}<Y_{i}$ and the interval $[Y_{i},X_{i}]$ if
$Y_{i}<X_{i}$. We then say that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the
corresponding intervals intersect.
  We recall from our MA902 essay that fact that in such a graph, each edge
arises with probability $2/3$, and use this fact to obtain estimates of the
number of edges. Next, we turn to how these edges are spread out, seeing that
(for example) the range of degrees for the vertices is much larger than
classically, by use of an interesting geometrical lemma. We further investigate
the maximum degree, showing it is always very close to the maximum possible
value $(n-1)$, and the striking result that it is equal to $(n-1)$ with
probability exactly $2/3$. We also recall a result on the minimum degree, and
contrast all these results with the much narrower range of values obtained in
the alternative \lq comparable\rq\, model $G(n,2/3)$ (defined later).
  We then study clique numbers, chromatic numbers and independence numbers in
the Random Interval Graphs, presenting (for example) a result on independence
numbers which is proved by considering the largest chain in the associated
interval order.
  Last, we make some brief remarks about other ways to define random interval
graphs, and extensions of random interval graphs, including random dot product
graphs and other ways to define random interval graphs. We also discuss some
areas these ideas should be usable in. We close with a summary and some
comments.

$-a(\Omega) \log(H/\delta)$, for 3d CFTs when the entangling surface has a
sharp corner. $a(\Omega)$ is a function of the corner opening angle and behaves
as $a(\Omega\to \pi)\simeq \sigma (\pi-\Omega)^2$ and $a(\Omega\to 0)\simeq
\kappa/\Omega$, respectively. Recently, it is conjectured that
$\sigma/C_T=\pi^2/24 $, where $C_T$ is central charge in the stress tensor
correlator, is universal for general CFTs in three dimensions. In this paper,
by applying the general higher curvature gravity, we give a holographic proof
of this conjecture. We also clarify some interesting problems. Firstly, we find
that, in contrast to $\sigma/C_T$, $\kappa/C_T$ is not universal. Secondly, the
lower bound $a_E(\Omega)/C_T$ associated to Einstein gravity can be violated by
higher curvature gravity. Last but not least, we find that there are similar
universal laws for CFTs in higher dimensions. We give some holographic tests of
these new conjectures.

other ICT agents) are considered to represent and govern services and service
bonds of a household with external entities such as utilities.

and $Y$ is a functional of the joint distribution $P_{XY},$ which is sometimes
difficult to handle or estimate. A coarser description of the statistical
behavior of $(X,Y)$ is given by the marginal distributions $P_X, P_Y$ and the
adjacency relation induced by the joint distribution, where $x$ and $y$ are
adjacent if $P(x,y)>0$. We derive a lower bound on the mutual information in
terms of these entities. The bound is obtained by viewing the channel from $X$
to $Y$ as a probability distribution on a set of possible actions, where an
action determines the output for any possible input, and is independently
drawn. We also provide an alternative proof based on convex optimization, that
yields a generally tighter bound. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the
mutual information in terms of adjacency events between the action and the pair
$(X,Y)$, where in this case an action $a$ and a pair $(x,y)$ are adjacent if
$y=a(x)$. As an example, we apply our bounds to the binary deletion channel and
show that for the special case of an i.i.d. input distribution and a range of

field theory satisfies spin-statistics if it is both spin and super, and
$360^\circ$-rotation of the spin structure agrees with the operation of
flipping the signs of all fermions. We set up a framework in which these two
notions are precisely analogous. In this framework, field theories are defined
over $\mathrm{Vect}_{\mathbb R}$, but rather than being defined in terms of a
single tangential structure, they are defined in terms of a bundle of
tangential structures over $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb R)$. Bundles of tangential
structures may be etale-locally equivalent without being equivalent, and
Hermitian field theories are nothing but the field theories controlled by the
unique nontrivial bundle of tangential structures that is etale-locally
equivalent to Orientations. This bundle owes its existence to the fact that
$\pi_1^{et}(\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb R)) = \pi_1{BO}$. We interpret Deligne's
""existence of super fiber functors"" theorem as implying that in a
categorification of algebraic geometry in which symmetric monoidal categories
replace commutative rings, $\pi_2^{et}(\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb R)) = \pi_2{BO}$.
There are eight bundles etale-locally equivalent to Spins, one of which is
distinguished; upon unpacking the meaning of that distinguished tangential
structure, one arrives at field theories that are both Hermitian and satisfy
spin-statistics. Finally, we formulate a notion of ""reflection-positivity"" and
prove that if an etale-locally-oriented field theory is reflection-positive
then it is necessarily Hermitian, and if an etale-locally-spin field theory is
reflection-positive then it necessarily both satisfies spin-statistics and is
Hermitian. The latter result is a topological version of the famous
Spin-Statistics Theorem.

travel and wormholes. We prove that ANEC is obeyed by a minimally-coupled, free
quantum scalar field on any achronal null geodesic (not two points can be
connected with a timelike curve) surrounded by a tubular neighborhood whose
curvature is produced by a classical source. To prove ANEC we use a
null-projected quantum inequality, which provides constraints on how negative
the weighted average of the renormalized stress-energy tensor of a quantum
field can be. Starting with a general result of Fewster and Smith, we first
derive a timelike projected quantum inequality for a minimally-coupled scalar
field on flat spacetime with a background potential. Using that result we
proceed to find the bound of a quantum inequality on a geodesic in a spacetime
with small curvature, working to first order in the Ricci tensor and its
derivatives. The last step is to derive a bound for the null-projected quantum
inequality on a general timelike path. Finally we use that result to prove

to the zero point energy, the LLB of Weyl cones remains at zero energy unless a
strong magnetic field couples the Weyl fermions of opposite chirality. In the
Weyl semimetal TaP, we achieve such a magnetic coupling between the
electron-like Fermi pockets arising from the W1 Weyl fermions. As a result,
their LLBs move above chemical potential, leading to a sharp sign reversal in
the Hall resistivity at a specific magnetic field corresponding to the W1 Weyl
node separation. By contrast, despite having almost identical carrier density,
the annihilation is unobserved for the hole-like pockets because the W2 Weyl

one-point statistics of carbon-monoxide intensity maps. Using a P(D) analysis,
the luminosity function of CO-emitting sources can be inferred from the
measured one-point intensity PDF. The star-formation rate density (SFRD) can
then be obtained, at several redshifts, from the CO luminosity density. We
study the effects of instrumental noise, line foregrounds, and target redshift,
and obtain constraints on the CO luminosity density of order 10%. We show that
the SFRD uncertainty is dominated by that of the model connecting CO luminosity
and star formation. For pessimistic estimates of this model uncertainty, we
obtain an error of order 50% on SFRD for surveys targeting redshifts between 2
and 7 with reasonable noise and foregrounds included. However, comparisons
between intensity maps and galaxies could substantially reduce this model
uncertainty. In this case our constraints on SFRD at these redshifts improve to
roughly 5-10%, which is highly competitive with current measurements.

antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ($J$) and Kitaev ($K$) exchanges, and crucially,
an anisotropic $(\Gamma)$ exchange. Our classical analysis of the spin model

ferromagnetic phases dominate the $J$-$K$-$\Gamma$ phase diagram. We apply our

Ir$^{4+}$ ions form layered two-dimensional triangular lattices. We compute the

with the resummation. In particular, interfacing to parton-distribution
functions, combining various channels, and performing the phase space
integration can be limiting factors in completing calculations. Conveniently,
however, most of these tasks are already automated in many Monte Carlo

associated color structures representing the hard factor in a resummed
distribution. These distributions can then be used to weight convolutions of
jet, soft and beam functions producing a complete resummed calculation. In
fact, only around 1000 unweighted events are necessary to produce precise
distributions. A number of examples and checks are provided, including $e^+e^-$

lattice QCD input and experimental data on quark flavour observables and
corresponding theoretical calculations, taking into account new lower bounds on
the symmetry breaking scale and the mirror quark masses from the LHC. We
investigate by how much the branching ratios for a number of rare $K$ and $B$
decays are still allowed to depart from their SM values. This includes
$K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$, $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$, $K_L\to \mu^+\mu^-$,
$\epsilon'/\epsilon$, $B\to X_s\gamma$, $B_{s,d}\to\mu^+\mu^-$, $B\to

constraints from $\Delta F=2$ processes, significant departures from the SM
predictions for $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ and $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ are
possible while the effects in $B$ decays are much smaller. In particular, the
LHT model favours $\mathcal{B}(B_{s}\to\mu^+\mu^-) \ge
\mathcal{B}(B_{s}\to\mu^+\mu^-)_{\rm SM}$, which is not supported by the data,
and the present anomalies in $B\to K^{(*)}\ell^+\ell^-$ decays cannot be
explained in this model. With the recent lattice and large $N$ input the
imposition of the $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ constraint implies a significant
suppression of the branching ratio for $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ with respect to
its SM value while allowing only for small modifications for
$K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$. Finally, we investigate how the LHT physics could be
distinguished from other models by means of indirect measurements and discuss
the consequences for quark flavour observables of not finding any LHT state in
the coming years.

density of dN/dz(SiIII)=2.5 for absorbers with column densities log
N(SiIII)>12.2. We develop a geometrical model for the absorption-cross section
of the CGM around the local galaxy population and find excellent agreement
between the model predictions and the observations. We further compare
redshifts and positions of the absorbers with that of ~64,000 galaxies using
archival galaxy-survey data. For the majority of the absorbers we identify
possible host galaxies within 300 km/s of the absorbers and derive impact
parameters rho<200 kpc, demonstrating that the spatial distributions of SiIII
absorbers and galaxies are highly correlated. Our study indicates that the
majority of SiIII-selected absorbers in our sample trace the CGM of nearby
galaxies within their virial radii at a typical covering fraction of ~70 per

gravitational couplings. Non-local functions originally defined in flat space
can not be easily generalized to curved space. The problem is made worse by the
calculational impossibility of providing closed form expressions in a general
metric. The technique of covariant perturbation theory (CPT) has been pioneered
by Vilkovisky, Barvinsky and collaborators whereby the effective action is
displayed as an expansion in the generalized curvatures similar to the
Schwinger-De Witt local expansion. We present an alternative procedure to
construct the non-local action which we call {\em non-linear completion}. Our
approach is in one-to-one correspondence with the more familiar diagrammatic
expansion of the effective action. This technique moreover enables us to decide
on the appropriate non-local action that generates the QED trace anomaly in
4$D$. In particular we discuss carefully the curved space generalization of
$\ln \Box$, and show that the anomaly requires both the anomalous logarithm as
well as $1/\Box$ term where the latter is related to the Riegert anomaly
action.

forces. In generalized gradient systems we allow for arbitrary relations
derived from general non-quadratic dissipation potentials. This paper describes
two natural origins for these structures.
  A first microscopic origin of generalized gradient structures is given by the
theory of large-deviation principles. While Markovian diffusion processes lead
to classical gradient structures, Poissonian jump processes give rise to
cosh-type dissipation potentials.
  A second origin arises via a new form of convergence, that we call
EDP-convergence. Even when starting with classical gradient systems, where the
dissipation potential is a quadratic functional of the rate, we may obtain a
generalized gradient system in the evolutionary $\Gamma$-limit. As examples we
treat (i) the limit of a diffusion equation having a thin layer of low
diffusivity, which leads to a membrane model, and (ii) the limit of diffusion
over a high barrier, which gives a reaction-diffusion system.

increase contact area while bulk elasticity opposes it. Recently, solid surface
stress has been shown also to play an important role in opposing deformation of
soft materials. This suggests that the contact line in soft adhesion should
mimic that of a liquid droplet, with a contact angle determined by surface
tensions. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe a contact angle of a soft
silicone substrate on rigid silica spheres that depends on the surface
functionalization but not the sphere size. However, to satisfy this wetting
condition without a divergent elastic stress, the gel separates from its
solvent near the contact line. This creates a four-phase contact zone with two
additional contact lines hidden below the surface of the substrate. While the
geometries of these contact lines are independent of the size of the sphere,
the volume of the phase-separated region is not, but rather depends on the
indentation volume. These results indicate that theories of adhesion of soft
gels need to account for both the compressibility of the gel network and a
non-zero surface stress between the gel and its solvent.

  \begin{align*}
  \sum_{x\in S} f(x)=b.
  \end{align*} In this paper, we establish several asymptotic formulas for
$N_f(D,k, b)$, depending on the nature of the ring $R$ and $f$.
  For $R=\mathbb{Z}_n$, let $p=p(n)$ be the smallest prime divisor of $n$,
$|D|=n-c \geq C_dn p^{-\frac 1d }+c$ and $f(x)=a_dx^d +\cdots +a_0\in
\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $(a_d, \dots, a_1, n)=1$. Then
  $$\left| N_f(D, k, b)-\frac{1}{n}{n-c \choose k}\right|\leq

answering an open question raised by Stanley \cite{St}, where
$\delta(n)=\sum_{i\mid n, \mu(i)=-1}\frac 1 i$ and $C_d=e^{1.85d}$.
Furthermore, if $n$ is a prime power, then $\delta(n) =1/p$ and one can take
$C_d=4.41$.
  For $R=\mathbb{F}_q$ of characteristic $p$, let $f(x)\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ be
a polynomial of degree $d$ not divisible by $p$ and
  $D\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$ with $|D|=q-c\geq (d-1)\sqrt{q}+c$. Then $$\left|
N_f(D, k, b)-\frac{1}{q}{q-c \choose k}\right|\leq {\frac{q-c}{p}+\frac
{p-1}{p}((d-1)q^{\frac 12}+c)+k-1 \choose k}.$$
  If $f(x)=ax+b$, then this problem is precisely the well-known subset sum
problem over a finite abelian group. Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and let
$D\subseteq G$ with $|D|=|G|-c\geq c$. Then $$\left| N_x(D, k,
b)-\frac{1}{|G|}{|G|-c \choose k}\right|\leq {c + (|G|-2c)\delta(e(G))+k-1
\choose k},$$ where $e(G)$ is the exponent of $G$ and $\delta(n)=\sum_{i\mid n,
\mu(i)=-1}\frac 1 i$. In particular, we give a new short proof for the explicit

show that this $\sigma$-model is defined by the equivariant extension of the
Kirillov symplectic form on the coadjoint orbit. This allows to define the
corresponding observable on arbitrary 2-dimensional surfaces, including closed
surfaces. We give a new path integral presentation of Wilson lines in terms of
Poisson $\sigma$-models, and we test this presentation in the framework of the
2-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. On a closed surface, our Wilson surface
observable turns out to be nontrivial for $G$ non-simply connected (and trivial
for $G$ simply connected), in particular we study in detail the cases $G=U(1)$
and $G=SO(3)$.

Previously, no has seriously addressed the question as to the exact explosion
site in 1572. We now provide accurate measures of the supernova position by two
radically different methods. Our first method is to use the 42 measured angular
distances between the supernova in 1572 and bright nearby stars, with
individual measures being as good as 84 arc-seconds, and all resulting in a
position with a 1-$\sigma$ error radius of 39 arc-seconds (including systematic
uncertainties). Our second method is to use a detailed and realistic expansion
model for 19 positions around the edge of the remnant, where the swept-up
material has measured densities, and we determine the center of expansion with
a chi-square fit to the 19 measured radii and velocities. This method has a
1-$\sigma$ error radius of 7.5 arc-seconds. Both measures are substantially
offset from the geometric center, and both agree closely, proving that neither
has any significant systematic errors. Our final combined position for the site

can make use of motion to exchange information. A typical example for shared

a shared secret (key) from shared motion, e.g. for device pairing, is an
obvious application for this. Only the keys need to be exchanged between the

high bending flexibility, but the cause of this flexibility is poorly

whether such excitation can occur with the level of DNA bending in these
experiments remains unclear. Intriguingly, the DNA contained preexisting nicks
in most of these experiments but whether nicks might play a role in flexibility
has never been considered in the interpretation of experimental results. Here,
using full-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show that nicks promote DNA
basepair disruption at the nicked sites, which drastically reduces DNA bending
energy. In addition, lower temperatures suppress the nick-dependent basepair
disruption. In the absence of nicks, basepair disruption can also occur but
requires a higher level of DNA bending. Therefore, basepair disruption inside
B-form DNA can be suppressed if the DNA contains preexisting nicks. Overall,
our results suggest that the reported mechanical anomaly of sharply bent DNA is
likely dependent on preexisting nicks, therefore the intrinsic mechanisms of
sharply bent nick-free DNA remain an open question.

of intense research. This structure is intimately linked to the dynamics of
water molecules, which can be measured using Raman and infrared spectroscopies.
The assignment of spectral peaks depends on whether they are collective modes
or single molecule motions. Vibrational modes in liquids are usually considered
to be associated to the motions of single molecules or small clusters. Using
molecular dynamics simulations we find dispersive optical phonon-like modes in
the librational and OH stretching bands. We argue that on subpicosecond time
scales these modes propagate through water's hydrogen bond network over
distances of up to two nanometers. In the long wavelength limit these optical
modes exhibit longitudinal-transverse splitting, indicating the presence of
coherent long range dipole-dipole interactions, as in ice. Our results indicate

convergence of the electromagnetic far-field and has been adapted to model
various optical devices and wave configurations. In this article, we
investigate the accuracy with which the electromagnetic near-field can be
calculated by using RCWA and explain the observed slow convergence and
numerical artifacts from which it suffers, namely unphysical oscillations at
material boundaries due to the Gibb's phenomenon. In order to alleviate these
shortcomings, we also introduce a mathematical formulation for accurate
near-field calculation in RCWA, for one- and two-dimensional straight and
slanted diffraction gratings. This accurate near-field computational approach
is tested and evaluated for several representative test-structures and
configurations in order to illustrate the advantages provided by the proposed
modified formulation of the RCWA.

clouds (GMCs) is believed to be important to the control of star formation. For
the most massive and dense clouds, including those in which super star clusters
(SSCs) are born, pressure from reprocessed radiation exerted on dust grains may
disperse a significant portion of the cloud mass back into the interstellar
medium (ISM). Using our radiaton hydrodynamics (RHD) code, Hyperion, we conduct
a series of numerical simulations to test this idea. Our models follow the
evolution of self-gravitating, strongly turbulent clouds in which collapsing
regions are replaced by radiating sink particles representing stellar clusters.
We evaluate the dependence of the star formation efficiency (SFE) on the size
and mass of the cloud and $\kappa$, the opacity of the gas to infrared (IR)
radiation. We find that the single most important parameter determining the
evolutionary outcome is $\kappa$, with $\kappa \gtrsim 15 \text{ cm}^2 \text{
g}^{-1}$ needed to disrupt clouds. For $\kappa = 20-40 \text{ cm}^2 \text{
g}^{-1}$, the resulting SFE=50-70% is similar to empirical estimates for some
SSC-forming clouds. The opacities required for GMC disruption likely apply only
in dust-enriched environments. We find that the subgrid model approach of
boosting the direct radiation force $L/c$ by a ""trapping factor"" equal to a
cloud's mean IR optical depth can overestimate the true radiation force by
factors of $\sim 4-5$. We conclude that feedback from reprocessed IR radiation
alone is unlikely to significantly reduce star formation within GMCs unless
their dust abundances or cluster light-to-mass ratios are enhanced.

merger of carbon-oxygen and helium-rich white dwarfs. Our new RCB birthrate
($1.8 \times 10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) is a factor of 10 lower than previous
theoretical estimates. This results in roughly 180--540 RCB stars in the
Galaxy, depending on the RCB lifetime. From the theoretical and observational
estimates, we calculate the total dust production from RCB stars and compare
this rate to dust production from novae and born-again asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars. We find that the amount of dust produced by RCB stars is
comparable to the amounts produced by novae or born-again post-AGB stars,
indicating that these merger objects are a viable source of carbonaceous
pre-solar grains in the Galaxy. There are graphite grains with carbon and

adding weight to the suggestion that these rare objects are a source of
stardust grains.

articles over a social network. Speed of spread means the number of readers
that the news has reached in a given time, while width of spread means how far
the story has travelled from the news originator within the social network.
After analyzing six stories in a 30-hour time span, we found out that the
lifetime of a story's popularity among the members of the social network has
three phases: Expansion, Front-page, and Saturation. Expansion phase starts
when a story is published and the article spreads from a source node to nodes
within a connected component of the social network. Front-page phase happens
when a news aggregator promotes the story in its front page resulting to the
story's faster rate of spread among the connected nodes while at the same time
spreading the article to nodes outside the original connected component of the
social network. Saturation phase is when the story ages and its rate of spread
within the social network slows down, suggesting popularity saturation among
the nodes. Within these three phases, we observed minimal changes on the width
of information spread as suggested by relatively low increase of the width of
the spread's diameter within the social network. We see that this paper

application, known as GMOL, designed to effectively visualize genome tertiary
structures at multiple scales so that researchers may better analyze their
genomic data. GMOL was developed based upon our multi-scale approach that
allows a user to zoom in and out between six separate levels within the genome.
These six scales are full genome, chromosome, loci, fiber, nucleosome, and
nucleotide. In order to store the data of the different scales, a new file
format, known as GSS, was created. With GMOL, a user can choose any unit at any
scale and scale it up or down to visualize its structure and retrieve
corresponding genome sequences from either Ensembl or a local database. Users
can also interactively manipulate and measure the whole genome structure and
extract static images and machine-readable data files in PDB format from the
multi-scale structure. By using GMOL researchers will be able to better
understand and analyze genome structure models and the impact their structural
relations have on genome activity and DNA function through GMOLs unique
features and functions, which includes the multi-scale method that can satisfy
the users requirement to not only visualize genome tertiary structure, but also

the texture evolution, the evolution of the internal elastic strains, and the

during reverse tension. The same alloy does not favor twinning during initial

electron random hopping into/out of the $m=0$ (or $m=\pm1$) subspace. This
contribution is not suppressed even under saturated optical pumping and/or
vanishing magnetic field, thus providing a possible solution to the puzzling
observation of nuclear spin dephasing in zero perpendicular magnetic field [M.

non-quantum physics, is singular and entails divergent fields and integrals.
ii. In quantum physics EM plays an asymmetric roll. It acts on quantum wave
fields (wave functions) but the wave fields do not react back. We suggest to
promote the one sided action of EM on quantum fields into a mutual
action-reaction partnership. By so doing, the quantum wave shares its
analyticity with the EM field and removes the later's singularities and
divergences. iii) The conventional U(1) symmetry leaves quantum dynamics
invariant under a 'general' Lorentz gauge and impose the standard minimal
coupling of the quantum wave to the Em 4-vector potential. One, however, has
the option to ask for in-variance under the 'restricted' Lorentz gauge. This in
turn invites in a coupling to derivatives of the vector potential in addition
to the minimal coupling and, so to say, enlarges the U(1) symmetry. We find
that the electron exhibits distributed charge- and current- densities. The
enlarged symmetry is expected to bring in its own constant of motion. Indeed it
does. The anomalous g-factor of the so designed electron emerges, up to order
({\alpha}/{\pi})^2 as the new constant of motion but, without invoking the QED
formalism.

requisite for the design of next-generation wireless communications standards.
In current work, a dual-hop cognitive (secondary) relaying system is
considered, incorporating multiple amplify-and-forward relays, a rather
cost-effective solution. First, the secondary relays sense the wireless
channel, scanning for a primary network activity, and then convey their reports
to a secondary base station (SBS). Afterwards, the SBS, based on these reports
and its own estimation, decides cooperatively the presence of primary
transmission or not. In the former scenario, all the secondary nodes start to
harvest energy from the transmission of primary node(s). In the latter
scenario, the system initiates secondary communication via a best relay
selection policy. Performance evaluation of this system is thoroughly
investigated, by assuming realistic channel conditions, i.e., non-identical
link-distances, Rayleigh fading, and outdated channel estimation. The detection
and outage probabilities as well as the average harvested energy are derived as
new closed-form expressions. In addition, an energy efficiency optimization
problem is analytically formulated and solved, while a necessary condition in
terms of power consumption minimization for each secondary node is presented.
From a green communications standpoint, it turns out that energy harvesting
greatly enhances the resources of secondary nodes, especially when primary
activity is densely present.

tracking numerous similar targets in the presence of high levels of noise, high
target density, complex motion patterns and intricate interactions. In this
paper, we propose a framework for tracking these structures based on the random
finite set Bayesian filtering framework. We focus on challenging biological
applications where image characteristics such as noise and background intensity
change during the acquisition process. Under these conditions, detection
methods usually fail to detect all particles and are often followed by missed
detections and many spurious measurements with unknown and time-varying rates.
To deal with this, we propose a bootstrap filter composed of an estimator and a
tracker. The estimator adaptively estimates the required meta parameters for
the tracker such as clutter rate and the detection probability of the targets,
while the tracker estimates the state of the targets. Our results show that the
proposed approach can outperform state-of-the-art particle trackers on both
synthetic and real data in this regime.

properly deal with multi-peak structures of spectra resulting from thermal

Decreasing the temperature, we slow down the formation and organization of

study much shorter time scales,in the physical mechanisms underlying the
pattern formation, than previously reported. We find that the patterns organize
themselves in sub-structures which size increase with the temperature,
following the diffusion coefficient evolution of the material. That result
suggests that the pattern formation and organization is mainly governed by

inelastic backscattering that does not break time-reversal symmetry (TRS),
resulting in interaction-dependent power law corrections to the conductance.
Here, we use a non-equilibrium Keldysh formalism to describe the situation of a
long, one-dimensional edge channel coupled to external reservoirs, where the
applied bias is the leading energy scale. By calculating explicitly the
corrections to the conductance up to fourth order of the impurity strength, we
analyse correlated single- and two-particle backscattering processes on a
microscopic level. Interestingly, we show that the modeling of the leads
together with the breaking of Galilean invariance has important consequences on
the transport properties. Such breaking occurs, because the Galilean invariance
of the bulk spectrum transforms into an emergent Lorentz invariance of the edge
spectrum. With this broken Galilean invariance at the QSH edge, we find a
contribution to single particle backscattering with a very low power scaling,
while in the presence of Galilean invariance the leading contribution would be
due to correlated two-particle backscattering only. This difference is further
reflected in different values of the Fano factor of the shot noise, an
experimentally observable quantity. The described behaviour is specific to the
Rashba scatterer, and does not occur in the case of backscattering off a
time-reversal breaking, magnetic impurity.

exponentially and the thermodynamic quantities display very mild

the indirect coupling between a one-dimensional \emph{DIII}-class topological
and s-wave superconductors via a quantum dot. By performing the
Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we find that the single-electron occupation in
the quantum dot induces various correlation modes, such as the Kondo and
singlet-triplet correlations between the quantum dot and the $s$-wave
superconductor and the spin exchange correlation between the dot and Majorana
doublet. Moreover, it plays a nontrivial role in modifying the Josephson
effect, leading to the occurrence of anisotropic and high-order Kondo
correlation. In addition, due to the quantum dot in the Kondo regime, extra
spin exchange correlations contribute to the Josephson effect as well.
Nevertheless, if the \emph{DIII}-class topological superconductor degenerates
into \emph{D}-class because of the destruction of time-reversal invariance, all
such terms will disappear completely. We believe that this work shows the
fundamental difference between the \emph{D}- and \emph{DIII}-class topological
superconductors.

fine tuned solutions, while the second heaviest right-handed neutrino $N_2$ is

$N_2$ dominated leptogenesis in an existing model, the A to Z of flavour with
Pati-Salam, where the neutrino Dirac mass matrix may be equal to an up-type
quark mass matrix and has a particular constrained structure. The numerical
results, supported by analytical insight, show that in order to achieve
successful $N_2$ leptogenesis, consistent with neutrino phenomenology, requires
a ""flavour swap scenario"" together with a less hierarchical pattern of RH
neutrino masses than naively expected, at the expense of some mild fine-tuning.
These results may be relevant for other $SO(10)$-like unified models where
$N_2$ leptogenesis is necessary.

basic scientific and technological points of view. Its electronic state has
been investigated in terms of a proton embedded in the electron gas mostly by
the local density approximation (LDA) to the density functional theory. At high
electronic densities, it is well described by a bare proton H^+ screened by
metallic electrons (charge resonance), while at low densities two electrons are
localized at the proton site to form a closed-shell negative ion H^- protected
from surrounding metallic electrons by the Pauli exclusion principle. However,
no details are known about the transition from H^+ to H^- in the
intermediate-density region. Here, by accurately determining the ground-state
electron distribution n(r) by the combination of LDA and diffusion Monte Carlo
simulations with the total electron number up to 170, we obtain a complete

H^+ screening charge resonance to long-range Kondo-like spin-singlet resonance,
the emergence of which is confirmed by the presence of an anomalous Friedel

competition between charge and spin resonances, enriching the century-old

our approach led to the detection of signals involving genes known to act on

means of two main strategies. The first makes use of a dark energy barotropic
fluid entering \emph{by hand} the energy-momentum tensor of Einstein's theory.
The second lies on extending the Hilbert-Einstein action giving rise to the
class of extended theories of gravity. In this work, we propose a third
approach, derived as an intrinsic geometrical effect of space-time, which
provides repulsive regions under certain circumstances. We demonstrate that the
effects of repulsive gravity naturally emerge in the field of a homogeneous and
isotropic universe. To this end, we use an invariant definition of repulsive
gravity based upon the behavior of the curvature eigenvalues. Moreover, we show
that repulsive gravity counterbalances the standard gravitational attraction
influencing both late and early times of the universe evolution. This
phenomenon leads to the present speed up and to the fast expansion due to the
inflationary epoch. In so doing, we are able to unify both dark energy and
inflation in a single scheme, showing that the universe changes its dynamics
when ${\ddot H\over H}=-2\dot H$, at the repulsion onset time where this
condition is satisfied. Further, we argue that the spatial scalar curvature can
be taken as vanishing because it does not affect at all the emergence of
repulsive gravity. We check the goodness of our approach through two
cosmological fits involving the most recent union 2.1 supernova compilation.

from a true orbit are magnified by a large exponential rate making direct
computational methods fail quickly. Here, a method is developed that avoids
direct calculation of the orbit by making use of the well-known stability

the manifolds, long orbit segments can be calculated using the stable and
unstable manifold intersections of the heteroclinic (homoclinic) tangle.

compact operational models for expressing causality. The models we propose have
a bisimilarity relation and a minimal representative for each equivalence
class, and they can be fully explained as coalgebras on a presheaf category on
an index category of partial orders. First, we provide a set-theoretic model in
the form of a a causal case graph, that is a labeled transition system where
states and transitions represent markings and firings of the net, respectively,
and are equipped with causal information. Most importantly, each state has a
poset representing causal dependencies among past events. Our first result
shows the correspondence with behavior structure semantics as proposed by
Trakhtenbrot and Rabinovich. Causal case graphs may be infinitely-branching and
have infinitely many states, but we show how they can be refined to get an
equivalent finitely-branching model. In it, states are equipped with
symmetries, which are essential for the existence of a minimal, often
finite-state, model. The next step is constructing a coalgebraic model. We
exploit the fact that events can be represented as names, and event generation
as name generation. Thus we can apply the Fiore-Turi framework: we model causal
relations as a suitable category of posets with action labels, and generation
of new events with causal dependencies as an endofunctor on this category. Then
we define a well-behaved category of coalgebras. Our coalgebraic model is still
infinite-state, but we exploit the equivalence between coalgebras over a class
of presheaves and History Dependent automata to derive a compact
representation, which is equivalent to our set-theoretical compact model.
Remarkably, state reduction is automatically performed along the equivalence.

diagnostic potential of seismic inversions. The combination of various seismic
indicators helps to provide more constrained and accurate fundamendal
parameters for these stars. We use the latest seismic, spectroscopic and
interferometric observational constraints in the litterature for this system to
determine reference models independently for both stars. We carry out seismic
inversions of the acoustic radius, the mean density and a core conditions
indicator. We note that a degeneracy exists for the reference models. Namely,
changing the diffusion coefficient or the chemical composition within the
observational values leads to 5% changes in mass, 3% changes in radius and up
to 8% changes in age. We use acoustic radius and mean density inversions to
improve our reference models then carry out inversions for a core conditions

combustion regimes in the mixture, formed by suspension of fine inert particles
in hydrogen gas. The gaseous phase is assumed to be transparent for the thermal
radiation, while the radiant heat absorbed by the particles is then lost by
conduction to the surrounding gas. The particles and gas ahead of the flame is
assumed to be heated by radiation from the original flame. It is shown that the
maximum temperature increase due to the radiation preheating becomes larger for
a flame with lower velocity. For a flame with small enough velocity temperature
of the radiation preheating may exceed the crossover temperature, so that the
radiation heat transfer may become a dominant mechanism of the flame
propagation. In the case of non-uniform distribution of particles, the
temperature gradient formed due to the radiation preheating can initiate either
deflagration or detonation ahead of the original flame via the Zel'dovich's
gradient mechanism. The initiated combustion regime ignited in the preheat zone
ahead of the flame depends on the radiation absorption length and on the
steepness of the formed temperature gradient. Scenario of the detonation
triggering via the temperature gradient mechanism formed due to the radiation
preheating is plausible explanation of the transition to detonation in

even visible at room temperatures. The observed negative magnetoresistance is
sensitive to the angle between magnetic and electrical field, robust against

densities of our Cd3As2 samples obey an Arrhenius's law, decreasing from
3.0x10^17 cm^-3 at 300 K to 2.2x10^16 cm^-3 below 50 K. The low carrier

therefore attribute the observed negative magnetoresistance to the chiral

this motion if perturbed remain incompletely understood. In the current study,
we address these questions using a cell-center based model in which cells are
polarized, motile, and interact with the neighboring cells via harmonic forces.
We demonstrate that, a simple evolution rule in which the polarization of any
cell tends to orient with its velocity vector can induce coherent motion in
geometrically confined environments. In addition to recapitulating coherent
rotational motion observed in experiments, our results also show the presence
of radial movements and tissue behavior that can vary between solid-like and
fluid-like. We show that the pattern of coherent motion is dictated by the
combination of different physical parameters including number density, cell
motility, system size, bulk cell stiffness and stiffness of cell-cell
adhesions. We further observe that, perturbations in the form of cell division
can induce a reversal in the direction of motion when cell division occurs
synchronously. Moreover, when the confinement is removed, we see that the
existing coherent motion leads to cell scattering, with bulk cell stiffness and
stiffness of cell-cell contacts dictating the invasion pattern. In summary, our
study provides an in-depth understanding of the origin of coherent rotation in

negative kinetic energy and vacuum instability when modeled as a scalar field.
However, the accepted values for present-day $w$ from Planck and WMAP9 include
a significant range of values less than $-1$. We find that it is not as obvious

general relativity, for which there is good experimental validation, we

This has
provided for a practical examination of an assortment of auction mechanisms
and, amongst these, two simultaneous ascending price auctions have proved to be
extremely successful. These are the simultaneous multiround ascending auction
(SMRA) and the combinatorial clock auction (CCA). It has long been known that,
for certain classes of valuation functions, the SMRA provides good theoretical
guarantees on social welfare. However, no such guarantees were known for the
CCA.
  In this paper, we show that CCA does provide strong guarantees on social
welfare provided the price increment and stopping rule are well-chosen. This is
very surprising in that the choice of price increment has been used primarily
to adjust auction duration and the stopping rule has attracted little
attention. The main result is a polylogarithmic approximation guarantee for
social welfare when the maximum number of items demanded $\mathcal{C}$ by a
bidder is fixed. Specifically, we show that either the revenue of the CCA is at
least an $\Omega\Big(\frac{1}{\mathcal{C}^{2}\log n\log^2m}\Big)$-fraction of
the optimal welfare or the welfare of the CCA is at least an
$\Omega\Big(\frac{1}{\log n}\Big)$-fraction of the optimal welfare, where $n$
is the number of bidders and $m$ is the number of items. As a corollary, the
welfare ratio -- the worst case ratio between the social welfare of the optimum
allocation and the social welfare of the CCA allocation -- is at most
$O(\mathcal{C}^2 \cdot \log n \cdot \log^2 m)$. We emphasize that this latter
result requires no assumption on bidders valuation functions. Finally, we prove
that such a dependence on $\mathcal{C}$ is necessary. In particular, we show
that the welfare ratio of the CCA is at least $\Omega \Big(\mathcal{C} \cdot
\frac{\log m}{\log \log m}\Big)$.

attributed to a finely tuned initial condition of the universe. This creates a
problem: why is the universe atypical? We suggest that the problem is an
artefact created by inappropriate transfer of the traditional concept of
entropy to the whole universe. Use of what we call the relational $N$-body
problem as a model indicates the need to employ two distinct entropy-type
concepts to describe the universe. One, which we call entaxy, is novel. It is
scale-invariant and decreases as the observable universe evolves. The other is
the algebraic sum of the dimensionful entropies of branch systems (isolated
subsystems of the universe). This conventional additive entropy increases. In
our model, the decrease of entaxy is fundamental and makes possible the
emergence of branch systems and their increasing entropy. We have previously
shown that all solutions of our model divide into two halves at a unique `Janus
point' of maximum disorder. This constitutes a common past for two futures each
with its own gravitational arrow of time. We now show that these arrows are
expressed through the formation of branch systems within which conventional
entropy increases. On either side of the Janus point, this increase is in the
same direction in every branch system. We also show that it is only possible to
specify unbiased solution-determining data at the Janus point. Special
properties of these `mid-point data' make it possible to develop a rational
theory of the typicality of universes whose governing law, as in our model,
dictates the presence of a Janus point in every solution. If our
self-gravitating universe is governed by such a law, then the second law of
thermodynamics is a necessary direct consequence of it and does not need any
special initial condition.

that the risk for the filtering and smoothing errors may be uniformly upper
bounded by the risk of the estimators. It has been proved very recently that
statistical inference for finite state space nonparametric HMMs is possible. We
study how the recent spectral methods developed in the parametric setting may
be extended to the nonparametric framework and we give explicit upper bounds
for the L2-risk of the nonparametric spectral estimators. When the observation
space is compact, this provides explicit rates for the filtering and smoothing

assessed with simulated data for both the estimation of the (nonparametric)
conditional distribution of the observations and the estimation of the marginal

describe the secrecy outage region (SOR), indicating all possible locations of

probability (SOP) is derived, and a jamming-beneficial range, i.e., the
distance range of eavesdroppers which enables uniform jamming to reduce the
SOP, is determined. Then, the optimal power allocation between messages and
artificial noise is investigated for different scenarios. Furthermore, to use
the jamming power more efficiently and further reduce the SOP, we propose
directional jamming that generates jamming signals at selected beams (mapped to
physical angles) only, and power allocation algorithms are proposed for the
cases with and without the information of the suspicious area, i.e., possible

successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's

DRQN's performance scales as a function of observability. Conversely, when
trained with full observations and evaluated with partial observations, DRQN's
performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history,
recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's

to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the

has shorter greedy paths, but worse (power law) scaling of the information
extraction locality (algorithmic complexity of a search). Introducing
saturation of the preferential attachment leads to truncated scale-free degree
distribution that offers a good tradeoff between these parameters and can be
useful for practical applications. Several features of the model are observed

address this fundamental question in a model material, poly(3-hexylthiophene).
Narrow zero-phonon lines from single chromophores are found to scatter over
200nm, an unprecedented inhomogeneous broadening which maps the ensemble. The
giant red-shift between solution and bulk films arises from energy transfer to
the lowest-energy chromophores in collapsed polymer chains which adopt a
highly-ordered morphology. We propose that the extreme energetic disorder of
chromophores is structural in origin. This structural disorder on the
single-chromophore level may actually enable the high degree of polymer chain
ordering found in bulk films: both structural order and disorder are crucial to
materials physics in devices.

lack of general methods that properly measure such an invariance. In this
paper, we propose a rigorous and systematic approach for quantifying the

cast the problem of assessing a classifier's invariance as the computation of
geodesics along the manifold of transformed images. We propose the Manitest
method, built on the efficient Fast Marching algorithm to compute the
invariance of classifiers. Our new method quantifies in particular the
importance of data augmentation for learning invariance from data, and the
increased invariance of convolutional neural networks with depth. We foresee
that the proposed generic tool for measuring invariance to a large class of

improving the invariance of existing classifiers.

quasi-particle excitations can be well-defined in the presence of local
density-density interactions. Here we examine this phenomenon from the
perspective of matrix representations of the commutator $\mathcal{H}
=[H,\bullet]$ ,with the aim of characterising the multi-particle content of the
many-body Majorana mode. To do this we show that, for quadratic fermionic
systems, $\mathcal{H}$ can always be decomposed into sub-blocks that act as
multi-particle generalisations of the BdG/Majorana forms that encode
single-particle excitations. In this picture, density-density like interactions
will break this exact excitation-number symmetry, coupling different sub-blocks
and lifting degeneracies so that the eigen-operators of the commutator
$\mathcal{H}$ take the form of individual eigenstate transitions $|n\rangle
\langle m|$. However, the Majorana mode is special in that zero-energy
transitions are not destroyed by local interactions and it becomes possible to
define many-body Majoranas as the odd-parity zero-energy solutions of
$\mathcal{H}$ that minimise their excitation number. This idea forms the basis
for an algorithm which is used to characterise the multi-particle excitation
content of the Majorana zero modes of the one-dimensional p-wave lattice model.
We find that the multi-particle content of the Majorana zero-mode operators is
significant even at modest interaction strengths. This has important
consequences for the stability of Majorana based qubits when they are coupled
to a heat bath. We will also discuss how these findings differ from previous
work regarding the structure of the many-body-Majorana operators and point out
that this should affect how certain experimental features are interpreted.

partial masslessness (PM) and conformal gravity. Linearly, the model propagates
six instead of seven degrees of freedom not only around de Sitter but also
around flat spacetime. Nonlinearly, the equations of motion can be recast in
the form of expansions in powers of curvatures, and exhibit a remarkable amount
of structure. In this form, the equations are shown to be invariant under
scalar gauge transformations, at least up to six orders in derivatives, the
lowest order term being a Weyl scaling of the metrics. The terms at
two-derivative order reproduce the usual PM gauge transformations on de Sitter
backgrounds. At the four-derivative order, a potential obstruction that could
destroy the symmetry is shown to vanish. This in turn guarantees the gauge
invariance to at least six-orders in derivatives. This is equivalent to adding
up to 10-derivative corrections to conformal gravity. More generally, we
outline a procedure for constructing the gauge transformations order by order
as an expansion in derivatives and comment on the validity and limitations of
the procedure. We also discuss recent arguments against the existence of a PM
gauge symmetry in bimetric theory and show that, at least in their present
form, they are evaded by the model considered here. Finally, we argue that a
bimetric approach to PM theory is more promising than one based on the
existence of a fundamental PM field.

demonstrated significant potential for biological and materials imaging. To
date, however, the primary mechanism of disseminating CARS spectroscopic
information is through pseudocolor imagery, which explicitly neglects a vast
majority of the hyperspectral data. Furthermore, current paradigms in CARS
spectral processing do not lend themselves to quantitative sample-to-sample
comparability. The primary limitation stems from the need to accurately measure
the so-called nonresonant background (NRB) that is used to extract the
chemically-sensitive Raman information from the raw spectra. Measurement of the
NRB on a pixel-by-pixel basis is a nontrivial task; thus, reference NRB from
glass or water are typically utilized, resulting in error between the actual
and estimated amplitude and phase. In this manuscript, we present a new
methodology for extracting the Raman spectral features that significantly
suppresses these errors through phase detrending and scaling. Classic methods
of error-correction, such as baseline detrending, are demonstrated to be
inaccurate and to simply mask the underlying errors. The theoretical
justification is presented by re-developing the theory of phase retrieval via
the Kramers-Kronig relation, and we demonstrate that these results are also
applicable to maximum entropy method-based phase retrieval. This new
error-correction approach is experimentally applied to glycerol spectra and
tissue images, demonstrating marked consistency between spectra obtained using
different NRB estimates, and between spectra obtained on different instruments.
Additionally, in order to facilitate implementation of these approaches, we

the supply and lowered the cost of natural gas in the United States, driving an
expansion of natural gas-fired generation capacity in several electrical
inter-connections. Gas-fired generators have the capability to ramp quickly and
are often utilized by grid operators to balance intermittency caused by wind
generation. The time-varying output of these generators results in time-varying
natural gas consumption rates that impact the pressure and line-pack of the gas
network. As gas system operators assume nearly constant gas consumption when
estimating pipeline transfer capacity and for planning operations, such
fluctuations are a source of risk to their system. Here, we develop a new
method to assess this risk. We consider a model of gas networks with
consumption modeled through two components: forecasted consumption and small
spatio-temporarily varying consumption due to the gas-fired generators being
used to balance wind. While the forecasted consumption is globally balanced
over longer time scales, the fluctuating consumption causes pressure
fluctuations in the gas system to grow diffusively in time with a diffusion
rate sensitive to the steady but spatially-inhomogeneous forecasted
distribution of mass flow. To motivate our approach, we analyze the effect of
fluctuating gas consumption on a model of the Transco gas pipeline that extends
from the Gulf of Mexico to the Northeast of the United States.

"1508.05122","Muhammad Usman","Muhammad Usman","On the flat galactic rotational curves in $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity","Explanation and references added, 32 pages, 44 figures, 2 table","Physica Scripta 2021","10.1088/1402-4896/abf0d4",,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A mysterious dark matter is supposed to exist in the galactic halos. In this
contrast, we discuss the possibility of explaining the flat rotational velocity
curves in f(R) gravity by solving field equations numerically in vacuum and for
different matter distributions. For a spherically symmetric static space-time
(as the galactic environment) we give metric for constant rotational velocity
regions. For a constant rotational velocity region, we prove that all values of
rotational velocities (most importantly observed rotational velocity
~200-300Km/s) do not lead to an analytic solution of the vacuum field
equations. We then obtain numerical solutions of the field equations in vacuum
and for three types of mass distributions named: (1) power law density profile,
(2) simple model for galaxy with a core and, (3) Navarro, Frank and White (NFW)
profile, for M31 and Milky way galaxy. The solutions suggest a slight
modification from linear relations from R for vacuum whereas a significant
deviation from R for the distributions can give flat rotational curves. Using
Brans-Dicke theory, we also relate obtained modified gravity function with the
equivalent scalar fields, the procedure gives us very interesting phenomena and
behavior of dark matter in the galactic environment. We observe that the scalar
dark matter, coming from different modified gravity functions of matter
profiles, does not accumulate as the baryonic matter. These results then can be
used to explain the spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the
center of the baryonic mass peaks of the bullet cluster and Abell-520.

"1508.05123","Jose G. Vargas","Jose G. Vargas","Algebraic Quarks from the Tangent Bundle: Methodology",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a previous paper, we developed a table of components of algebraic
solutions of a system of equations generated by an inhomogeneous proper-value
equation involving K\""ahler's total angular momentum. This table looks as if it
were a representation of real life quarks. We did not consider all options for
solutions of the system of equations that gave rise to it. We shall not,
therefore, claim that the present distribution of those components as a well
ordered table has strict physical relevance. It, however, is of great interest
for the purpose of developing methodology, which may then be used for other
solutions. We insert into our present table concepts that parallel those of the
phenomenology of HEP: generations, color, flavor, isospin, etc. Breaking then
loose from that distribution, we consider simpler alternatives for algebraic
""quarks"" of primary color (The mathematics speaks of each generation having its
own primary color). We use them to show how stoichiometric argument allows one
to reach what appear to be esthetically appealing idempotent representation of
particles for other than electrons and positrons (K\""ahler already provided
these half a century ago with idempotents similar to our hypothetical quarks).
We then use neutron decay to obtain formulas for also hypothetical algebraic
neutrinos and the $Z_{0}$, and use pair annihilation to obtain formulas for
gamma particles. We go back to the system of equations and develop an
alternative option. We solve the system but stop short of studying it along the
present line. This will thus be an easy entry point to this theory by HEP
physicists, who will be able to go aster and further.
